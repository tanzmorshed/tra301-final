","Growing up, my favorite book was, easily, ""Charlie & the Chocolate Factory"". Roald Dahl's magical tale of a young boy's adventure in the strange factory was spell-binding. Though I never had a problem with the original ""Willy Wonka"" move with Gene Wilder (despite how unfaithful it was, it was still a cute and heart-warming movie), I was doing back-flips when I heard Tim Burton, quite possibly my all-time favorite director, would helm a new version of the movie.<br/><br/>First and foremost, Johnny Depp is perfect as Willy Wonka. What people don't really pick up from the first movie is that Wonka was intended to be, well, crazy. He was eccentric and freaky, the way he allowed the rotten children to get what they deserved and protected his factory like it was his child. Gene Wilder portrayed Wonka more like a fatherly-figure, and really was just too nice. Depp pulls out all of the stops as a new Willy Wonka, though there are times that any audience member will get just a bit freaked out.<br/><br/>What I loved most about the movie was how faithful it was to the book. Everything that was mentioned, from the chocolate palace to the hair toffee, was taken directly from the book. I was incredibly impressed.<br/><br/>This is definitely a movie for everyone, especially those of us who hold the original tale in our hearts. Wonka chocolate bars for all!"

","Yesterday I had the pleasure of watching ""Charlie & the Chocolate Factory"" at the Wilkinson American Movie Day. And, oh boy, I was in delight! Don't expect a bleak remake of the amusing (and rather psychedelic) 1971-version. It is in every way a genuine Tim Burton-movie, stacked with beautiful imagery, wacky humor and bizarre characters, but at the same time faithful enough to the spirit of the novel. Roald Dahl would've been proud. It also features outstanding performances by the entire cast. Johnny Depp gives us a strange, almost creepy Willy Wonka, Freddie Highmore is a perfect Charlie, the Grandparents are lovable and wacky, and the five other children and their parents are amusingly irritating. And last but not least, an excellent soundtrack by Mr. Danny Elfman, reminiscent of both Edward Scissorhands and his early Oingo Boingo-days. Go see this with your parents, children, grandparents, movie buff-friends, nephews and nieces ... they will be equally delighted!"
"EdBloom","9","521","782","5 July 2005"," Burton does it again !
","I have seen Charlie & The Chocolate Factory last night and though I usually don't care very much in giving my opinion, the journey M. Burton and his team made me cross deserves an homage. Especially with all that criticism rising around the film before it has been released.<br/><br/>I have been a Tim Burton fan for more than a decade now; I grew up with his films. But what I have been through yesterday his really unique. I actually never thought he would offer us such a film one day. Fans of his first period, with all the lonely and desperate characters won't like it for sure. Since Mars Attacks !, and more specifically since Big Fish, Burton decided to tell things differently. His vision of the world slightly changed in every of his films : now, the rejected freak comes down to the world and stays. A world that remains frightening and weird even thought we call it ""reality"" but a world worth living in. And that's what Charlie & The Chocolate Factory is all about It all begins with a main title sequence that may be one of the main weaknesses of the film. The sequence is very entertaining and visually ambitious but they decided to go with CGI and it looks like it was a decision they made in last minute. Since the film was proudly made with ""real"" sets, ""real"" Oompas Loompas, ""real"" squirrels, the main title looks inappropriate. It's not that important but it's a Tim Burton film and we know how much he usually works on his main title. Hopefully, Danny Elfman is there with a crazy mix of the Edward Scissorhands and Spider-Man (the music when the title of the film appears gave me shivers), a true musical roller-coaster that gives a hint on what his score will sound like through the film. <br/><br/>After that, it's just emotions. All kinds of them: laughs (many  the audience laughed almost every thirty seconds), tears of joy (we all know Charlie's gonna find that ticket but when he does, you just can't refrain your heart to beat faster), mercy (the way Burton depicts the social misery of the Bucket's family is really touching), amazement (the Wonka Factory and its many rooms is true wonder, one the most achieved design Burton ever offered us) and many mores. Very much like the book, even though it seems simple and childish, you would like to stop for a second to collect those feelings and try to analyze them but you don't have the time. It just never stops (I realize it might be a flaw for some people in fact). Burton never has been so generous in terms of human warmness.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp proposes another inventive and completely wacky interpretation here. I won't compare with Gene Wilder since I don't know the first film very well (pretty unknown flick here in Europe) and those comparisons should stop anyway. Depp makes of Wonka a tormented and unadapted character who doesn't know much about common courtesy and doesn't really care anyway. He built up his own universe in response to his authoritarian father and he's pretty proud of it. He just doesn't want those ""weird"" (a word he likes  you've all seen the TV spots) and boring parents with their despicable children to ruin what is life is based on. Yet So Depp's Wonka is actually very moving and pathetic in his attempts to entertain his visitors. As Burton does everything he can to make you hate Augustus, Vercua, Violet and Mike at the moment you first see them, you get instantly closer to Wonka when you noticed he feels the same. In addition to that, John August's vision of Wonka's past (including an always perfect cameo by Christopher Lee) offers the character a real depth you didn't expect.<br/><br/>Danny Elfman is also one of the main attractions of the film. While his score is already classic Burton/Elfman work with some interesting experiments (the main themes are splendid), the songs he wrote for the Oompas Loompas are just so funny. Hugh laughs in the audience for some musical choices. Those songs don't intend to stay with you for months (it would have been hard as they're based on Dahl's lyrics that doesn't allow Broadway impulses), they're just off-beat numbers playing with many references in so many styles. Oingo Boingo fans have to buy the soundtrack when it'll come out, it'll bring them back 15 years ago.<br/><br/>What can I tell you more ? McDowell's sets are amazing, Pescucci's work is impressive as well as Rousselot's beautiful cinematography. Some Oscar Nominations should fall here.<br/><br/>As for the ending, without revealing it, August's additions are really touching and fit perfectly to Burton's new approach. Even though the final shot tempers the ""family"" theme that he developed through the film (it's still Burton, not Disney), Burton makes you feel good because he feels good (and what I'm writing here will ring a bell when you'll see the movie). I don't know for you but after so many distressed and pessimistic films, it really moved to see that he found a certain peace. Charlie and The Chocolate Factory is a step forward in the direction he gave to his career with Big Fish. He lost his father, he became one, he's getting older and all those questions and doubts are expressed in many important and very complex images and scenes he imagined for the film. That's why I could call this film the ""Edward Scissorhands"" of his new period. Those films are very different but gave me both some very essential emotions.<br/><br/>Thank you, M.Burton. Thank you very much"
"Dena-2","3","204","306","15 July 2005"," Not bad, but not good, either...
","I know I'm in the minority here, but I wasn't jumping up and down about this movie. I loved the book as a child and loved the original film with Gene Wilder for its own original contributions...perhaps I'm biased. Still, I have always admired Tim Burton and Johnny Depp's work, and had been looking forward to this new interpretation of Roald Dahl's book.<br/><br/>This film was, indeed, more true to the book than the 1971 version...the squirrel room, the jungle scene, the children leaving the factory, perhaps a little ""wiser for the wear."" However, the character development of the 1971 version was MUCH better than here...you were actually given an opportunity to like or dislike each character, including Willy Wonka. I did think that Johnny Depp's portrayal of Wonka was more true to the book than Gene Wilder's...Willy Wonka is supposed to be quite childish and eccentric. However, I thought that this film's preoccupation with being true to the book caused it to overlook what is more important, which is to establish the intentions of each character. At least in the 1971 version, it's pretty clear what each character's intentions are...even if establishing some of these intentions requires a conspiracy involving ""Slugworth."" And though I haven't read the book in a very long time, I do NOT remember any details being given as to Willy Wonka's childhood...I thought these were unnecessary, distracting, and a waste of time. This energy could have been better spent on the children's' character development, in my opinion. This is, after all, supposed to be a story for and about children.<br/><br/>The oompa loompas. It's true that they are physically portrayed accurately here more so than in the 1971 version, i.e. very small people and not midgets with orange skin and green hair. However, though the songs they sing here are true to the book, they are less charismatic than those of the 1971 film and sometimes seem over the top. Also, I didn't like that they were all clones of each other...I think that was a poor choice.<br/><br/>Finally, I was appalled with the ending...this ties in with my previous comments re: Willy Wonka's childhood. It changed the whole idea behind the story itself, which is supposed to be (from my perspective) that people can overcome their hardships to have a happy and prosperous ending, as long as they're honest, selfless, and generous. This movie changes the whole theme of the story to one that emphasizes the importance of family over any kind of material wealth or prosperity. Both are perfectly good and legitimate themes, but my reading of the book left me with an impression that Roald Dahl was more concerned with the former theme than the latter. Accordingly then, this movie did not do the book justice in the most important and fundamental way, whereas the 1971 film was able to do so despite its shortcomings."
"Clownbird","1","274","425","20 July 2005"," Wonkatrastrophe
","Tim Burton kept saying he wanted to make a version much more faithful to the source material, which leaves me wondering why he didn't. <br/><br/>There's the awful (and unnecessary, and counterproductive) back story showing Wonka's childhood, which is nothing more than an excuse for Burton to bring in one of his horror movie heroes from childhood (Christopher Lee) while completely killing any sense of mystery Wonka might otherwise possess.<br/><br/>I like Johnny Depp, but his Wonka had zero warmth...and was just plain creepy and random - one minute he's snippy and/or oblivious to the kids, the next he's paternal, offering Charlie some nourishing hot chocolate because he ""looks like he could use it"" (and because it's a line from the book).<br/><br/>Wonka in the book is a spritely little gent...neither Gene Wilder nor Johnny Depp are really much like him (much less so Depp), but Wilder's interpretation always has that twinkle in his eye - you know he's a little eccentric but he's always in control. The kids in this version are all pretty good. But Wonka himself? Yikes. Give me Gene Wilder's version over creepy Johnny Depp's Michael Jackson take any day.<br/><br/>The Oompa-Loompa musical numbers blew. The first one, in the chocolate room, was okay. But overall, I had a hard time understanding most of the lyrics. It was all just raucous noise. Come on, Elfman, you can do better than that.<br/><br/>Wonka telling Charlie he can't bring his family to live with him in the factory was insane. First of all, it makes Wonka look even more like a freaky pedophile; second of all - how on earth is that faithful to the book?!<br/><br/>This is the second time in recent memory I've heard of a producer/director wooing the widow of a beloved children's book author and then she deciding that her dead husband would love this new big-screen version of his source material. <br/><br/>Somewhere, Dr. Seuss is consoling Roald Dahl."
"acehembling99","1","128","196","4 July 2006"," This film is just wrong and horrible
","First of its important to say that I am a Roald Dahl fan, and indeed a fan of the original 1971 film Willy Wonka and the chocolate factory. What that film and the work of Roald Dahl have in common is charm, warmth, eccentricity etc. This Tim Burton film does not share in any of it. Having sat and forced myself to watch the entire film hoping something good would happen I was left feeling nothing but empty. I enjoyed most of Tim Burton's work and was rather excited about this film when it was announced, the trailers never gave away too much and I kept on hoping right up until the credits rolled. So whats so bad about it then? My first massive problem with the film is the reactions from the children through the film. Were they sedated during filming? Watch the scene where they tear down the chocolate river in the boiled sweet boat, does one of them even scream in delight? are they not amazed they are on a boat made from candy on a river of flowing chocolate? Most of the time they stand there looking like they would rather be somewhere else, how are we supposed to believe in the wonder of this amazing factory if the kids there aren't even impressed (too much blue screen work perhaps, means the poor actors had nothing to be amazed at) <br/><br/>my second not quite as massive problem with the film is Burton's muse Johnny Depp. Perhaps their relationship is getting stale but Depp's performance as Willy Wonka was nothing but irritating; less eccentric, more pathetic. The creepy grey skin, luminous teeth, puppy dog eyes and hushed voice all add up to a character that I was bored of in the first 5 minutes after seeing him. The ridiculous back story of his childhood was totally superfluous and added nothing to the film, it's like Burton really wasn't trying 'why does wonka love candy....? hmmmm maybe his father was a wicked dentist who wouldn't let him eat it... I could get christopher lee to play him! get on to casting!' Wonka was supposed to be a man with years and years of experience behind him, a weathered eccentric not an excitable/sedated puppy <br/><br/>point number 3 THE MUSIC, perhaps the worst score to a film I have ever heard, Danny elfman, shame on you. OK so they wanted to bring the songs up to date but jeez the music is just bad, the incidental music is bad also, its all bad.<br/><br/>#4 the Oompa Loompa's. this really made me sad, really sad, so in the revised book they are like miniature cavemen, in the 1971 film they are crazy psychedelic dwarfs, in this film they are... one man, one dwarf, Burton employed him in 'Big Fish' he did OK there but he is so wrong for the part of an oompa loompa and why does he have to play all of them? another gimmick that I suspect Burton really didn't waste any time over coming up with, his expressionless face might have worked as a sad clown but the cheeky Oompa Loompas? I think not there were a few god points, the authenticity (minus the stupid flashbacks) I loved seeing the candy boat in all its glory, the fudge mountain , an actual glass elevator rather than the weird gold thing in the 1971 film but who really cares about all these things when not one person in the film seemed to be impressed by it, did the crew record dry run rehearsals by accident? ( by the way the original elevator of the book didn't have rockets on the side it used sky hooks and was powered by sugar but kids would just laugh at that right?) It was nice to see charlie's dad regardless of the fact he is of no importance to the film. The sets were OK but lacked any real wow factor.<br/><br/>basically if you took burtons script chucked out all the nonsense hired a new director kept the sets and gave them a bit more wow and hired a new sound guy and told everyone to smile and have a laugh it wouldn't be that bad, but that didn't happen, mores the pity. OK so one day, say 30 years from now I will make it again its the only way I can resolve my issues with this disaster.<br/><br/>in short if you are a roald dahl fan and like the 1971 film DO NOT WATCH THIS, honestly I regret ever seeing it"
"rzg-2","1","154","240","10 November 2005"," Just does not hold up to Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory
","This movie was simply awful. Willy Wonka lacked the warmth, humor and wit that was shown by Gene Wilder in the original. The use of one person as the Oompa loompas comes off as cheap production, whether it was or not. The changes made, even subtle ones such as the order or events between Charlie finding the money and getting the last ticket and the introduction of the elevator just seem off. One of the most memorable moments is left out, which is the fizzy drink that makes Charlie and Uncle Joe float around.<br/><br/>The oompa loompa sequences are horrible, the main characters fail to connect with the viewer as they did in the original.. I could go on and on but will just end by saying....<br/><br/>This movie is proof that new technology, different actors, producers and directors do not always equal a better experience.<br/><br/>Save your time and your money... buy and watch the original. My 5 year only daughter even prefers it over the new."
"amypeterson12345","1","103","157","3 July 2008"," Garbage. Absolute, pure, filthy garbage.
","I honestly cannot see why anybody would like this rubbish over the original. Whereas the 1971 version sparkled with innocence, charm and magic, this monstrosity will leave you feeling violently ill and internally disturbed by the time the closing credits roll.<br/><br/>Let me begin by saying I don't personally enjoy Tim Burton's style, and didn't like the dark influence he brought to this film. Depp's Wonka is perhaps the creepiest character I've ever watched in a movie. Unlike Gene Wilder's eccentric yet loving Wonka, he openly expresses his disgust and hatred towards the children. One need only watch the scene in which a shrunken Mike Teavee is nearly stabbed by a vicious-faced Oompa-Loompa, or the one in which Veruca Salt is dragged screaming into the garbage chute while Wonka pretends he cannot find the right key to let Mr. Salt into save his daughter, to understand Wonka's cruelty. In the original, Wonka seemed merely disappointed and bored during the children's accidents, and he always kept his head; he knew no harm would befall the young troublemakers. Here, we see Wonka laughing, dancing and cheering as the Oompa Loompas sing about children being turned into chocolate and eaten.The scenes of the four naughty children's punishments were incredibly disturbing, and the jokes about cannibalism just made me cringe at the stupidity of it all. <br/><br/>Charlie Bucket, who should have been the main character, was a disappointment. Throughout most of the film he seems rather expressionless and bored, unlike the genuine and honest boy played by Peter Ostrum in the original movie. The 1971 Charlie had a dream; he wanted more than his poverty-stricken life, he strived to help his family out of tight situations, he wasn't perfect, but he was a believable character, and that's what made him so lovable; he was just like us all. This Charlie doesn't seem to care about anything; he seems perfectly happy with his life and hardly seems to care about getting a golden ticket. The other children are equally disappointing; Violet Beauregarde manages to pull off her characters fairly well, but even so she had little to work with. <br/><br/>The songs in the original were hopeful and inspiring, such as the charming 'Candy Man,' and 'I've Got a Golden Ticket,' the heartwarming 'Cheer up Charlie,' and the magnificent 'Pure Imagination.' In this new version,the only songs we get are a cheesy welcome song in which childlike puppets explode and melt into ghoulish wraith like figures, plus the nauseating Oompa-Loompa filth. The emotional 1971 ending with Wonka, Charlie and Grandpa Goe in the elevator has been replaced with Wonka refusing the other Buckets to enter the factory, becoming a hobo, and eventually reuniting with his abusive dentist father (???) <br/><br/>In a short review with a maximum of 1, 000 words I simply can't do justice to the badness of this movie, so I'll leave it at this: the old movie has a positive and uplifting message that will bring tears to even the coldest eye. This one crushes the viewer down into the dust while screaming its message into their face. So, unless you enjoy stupid jokes, children in despair and nauseating songs, don't waste any money on this soulless, emotionally disturbing piece of filth."
"WildVector","3","41","60","27 July 2005"," The Gene Wilder version was much better
","They took most of the fun and wit out of this movie compared to the 1971 version with Gene Wilder. In this one, Willy Wonka is a depressing weird loser instead of a wise prankster. He had none of the charm or appeal of Gene Wilder's Willy. All the characters were better in the 1971 movie except maybe Violet who had a little more going on this time. However her transformation into a blueberry is overdone and just looks like the computer FX it is. The oompa-loompa's are without personality and their songs are mostly unintelligible. The choreography was okay, but I couldn't help thinking, ""Those CGI guys sure did a lot of work on that."" Stick with the '71 version. The songs alone make it far superior to this corporate computerized makeover. The 2005 version definitely won't be remembered in 30 years."
"Tiger80","2","63","96","8 November 2005"," another tragic remake.
","Just like so many other remakes of great films, this is one that fails miserably on so many levels. First of all, Johnny Depp does not display near the wit nor the charisma that Gene Wlider did in the original. You actually see Willy Wonka before the big day arrives, which takes some of the mystery out of the character.<br/><br/>None of the characters are really enjoyable like in the first film. They seem to lack any real emotion or style. The special effects are overkill for the overtone of this story. It is almost like Walt Disney meets Timothy Leary. If you are a fan of the original, steer clear of this abomination."
"cnol12000","3","64","98","27 July 2005"," Tim and Johnny Disappoint
","If the only justification for this being a great movie is that it is true to the book, then it shouldn't have been made at all. Tim Burton has successfully digitized and sterilized the Chocolate Factory universe, and in so doing has destroyed a wonderful piece of pop culture. No longer will orange-faced, green-haired Oompa Loompas populate my imagination (and nightmares). No longer will I wonder just what in the world an American boy was doing living in a ramshackle house in a nondescript Bavarian town. And no longer will I wonder what drove Gene Wilder's Wonka to be such a lovable sadist, or just exactly what drugs he popped before taking that insane boat ride. In short, the imagination of the original film is gone, replaced with a shallow, bloated, big-budget disappointment. <br/><br/>When the film was first announced, I was ecstatic that Johnny Depp and Tim Burton would be taking it on. I thought only Johnny would have the skills to successfully reinvent the enigmatic Wonka, and only Burton (or maybe David Lynch) would be able to make the disturbing Oompa Loompa's even more disturbing. The film fails in both respects. <br/><br/>Visually, Depp does a fantastic job of capturing the essence of Wonka. His buggy sunglasses, velvet coat and top hat were faithful both to Wilder's Wonka and the whimsical nature of the character himself. But Depp's acting and/or the material he was working with fell flat. In the few lines of dialogue that actually fit into the context of the scene, Depp's delivery was synthetic and provided no insight into the character. Perhaps this was intended, but for me it backfired. If they wanted me to loathe the character, it worked. By contrast, Gene Wilder's take left no doubt about his distaste for children - Think of his wonderful eyerolling while saying, ""No, please, stop.."" - or his true reversal when he finally finds a child of virtue - ""You did it Charlie! I knew you would!"" His performance is nuanced and genuine. Depp's is taut and plastic. Where is the playful and inventive dialogue like ""Oh, you should never, never doubt what nobody is sure about."" and ""So much time and so little to do. Wait a minute. Strike that. Reverse it.""?<br/><br/>Now to the Oompa Loompa's. Those little orange buggers have been scaring the hell out of me ever since I saw the original as a child. I couldn't wait to see Burton's twisted take when the movie was announced. Then I heard that the Loompas would be played by one actor, Deep Roy, and digitally reproduced. I began to worry. My worries were well justified when I saw the film and the Oompas had become a cloned and shrunken version of Roy, with only latex jumpsuits to lend any suggestion of the bizarre. The musical numbers were equally disappointing. Glitzy, fast-paced and well choreographed, they nevertheless pale in comparison to the catchy and unforgettable originals with their ""doompa-dee-doos"" -- on a par with the ""Ohh-ee-ohhs"" of the Wizard of Oz for great movie choruses sung by guys with brightly-colored faces. In fact, I don't think there was one line in any of the new movie's songs that I actually could understand. And since the musical numbers added so much to the story in the original, I definitely felt something was missing this time. <br/><br/>Burton has always been a master at creating otherworldly environments that incorporate just enough anachronisms and bizarre elements to keep you guessing whether the story is supposed to be set in our universe or not. He does another admirable job of it here. From the opening credits, with their depiction of a Rube Goldbergesque chocolate machine, to the imaginative nut sorting room, Burton uses his talents well to create a rich landscape. However, I think he fell short in a few spots. His take on the Augustus Gloop and Violet Beauregarde incidents is identical to the original, but with less dialogue. And the only new element in the Mike Teevee scene is the cute homage to 2001: A Space Odyssey and other cinema classics. I think a director like Burton could have gone to town, so to speak, with this material and still stayed faithful to the book. <br/><br/>Another element of the film that I found irritating were the flashbacks to Wonka's youth and other departures from the main story, such as the origin of the Oompa Loompa's. The biographical material on Wonka not only eliminated some of the mystery surrounding the character, but it was tired and predictable to suggest that his eccentricities were the result of his troubled relationship with his father. (Gee - Their subsequent reconciliation at the end of the movie was a real shocker once this was revealed.) <br/><br/>And how, how, how, Mr. Burton, could you tackle the subject of the vicious indigenous creatures of Loompaland without talking about those rotten Vernicious Knits!<br/><br/>Bad remakes and needless sequels are not only poor cinema, they detract from their predecessors. Unfortunately, I think Burton's film will have just that impact on Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory. Perhaps I need to read the book again, something I haven't done since my childhood, to appreciate this movie for its faithfulness to Dahl's vision. Somehow, I don't think that will make me like it any better, though. After all, when we now see Homer in Simpsons episode DABF03 ask to see the Oompa Loompa because he's ""freaky"", will it strike the same chord? I think not."
"bigcajunfan","1","51","77","24 April 2008"," Horrid!
","This is a horrible horrible version of this movie. Where in the hell in the book does Wonka talk to his father. And the part where Wonka denies Charlie the factory because he wants to bring his family, absolutely ridiculous. Wonka is supposed to be an inspiration. Not a jerk who has a magical moment with his father. The characters are just completely screwed up. Why on earth would this remake even be considered good. My next problem Oompa Loompas. Where did this freakin idea come from. This movie may have been considered good only if you have never seen one: the original movie two: you have never read the book and three: you have never seen a johnny depp movie.

"thurberdrawing","8","136","221","18 July 2005"," Burton Studied the Book's Original Illustrations
","If Tim Burton's out there I just want to thank him for bringing the spirit of the book's original illustrations to the screen. He even matched the facial expressions to the drawings, especially in the case of Charlie's family. Charlie himself looks like one of the drawings, and the Bucket house is so much like the illustrations it caused me to realize that Burton is as visual as any movie director can be. (Recent editions feature the work of a different illustrator. I'm talking about the illustrations from the 1960s. The difference between the older illustrations and the newer ones is the older ones feature a lot of cross-hatching. I imagine the older illustrations are still available, especially in a hardcover, but you'll need to search the net.) I don't know how he did it, but he got the facial expressions of Charlie's family and of Mike Teavea's father down perfectly. He also absorbed Dahl's sense of humor. The opening fifteen minutes or so, in which the winners of the golden tickets are announced one by one, really get Roald Dahl's sense of the ridiculous. I think Burton's addition of Wonka's childhood story fits well, although I'll agree that the way this is resolved is not completely in Dahl's spirit. Even in the resolution, however, Burton maintains sly humor. It is well-acted by everybody. I'd like to say that Julia Winter, who plays Veruca Salt, has turned in a truly well-observed comedic performance. Depp converts the novel's jaunty, precise Wonka into a quirky one, but it works well, because, as in the novel, Wonka's endearing traits contrast with the fact that he's a tyrant. Roald Dahl gets a rap for his cynicism, and this movie softens his message a bit. Dahl is a bit like Orwell. Both of them point out that man, given power, will exploit his fellow human beings. CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY the movie is not quite as dark as the book. But it comes very, very close."

Then when you meet Wonka, he's nothing. Johnny Depp is as pale as a sheet; I'm not referring to his white makeup and fake white teeth, but his acting. He's doing an imitation of Jim Carrey doing an imitation of Michael Jackson. His Wonka not believable at all. The kids are just bad. Rich, and bad.

","I was actually excited to see this movie, I wasn't expecting anything, I was just intrigued to see another Tim Burton film. The pictures in the film and the factory were spectacular and mesmerizing. Without even paying attention to the story line it was clear this was a Tim Burton film, truly fantastic. But Like watching a model trying to ponder physics, the beauty is only skin deep. Where was the heart in this movie? The acting, the dialog, the people all fell short of human behavior. <br/><br/>Small example: A child spoiled all her life only taunts her father with the resounding demand: ""I want it Daddy."" Where's the yelling, the screams, has no one EVER SEEN a tantrum?? <br/><br/>Additional Example: The parents seemed hardly upset with their children's misfortune. As a parent would you not run out and help your daughter if she were attacked by ANYTHING much less squirrels?!<br/><br/>The Ompa Loompa problem: I loved them actually. Tiny, creepy, and what a great story on how they were found. They were great until they broke into a bad Britney spears song and dance. What the #*!$*#& was that?!<br/><br/>Flashback problem: I loved johnny's character, quirky and fun. Nevertheless, the flashbacks didn't add much at all to anything. And they were executed in the WORST WAYS i've ever seen. ""sorry I was having a flashback."" They are far better ways to have had those worked honestly.<br/><br/>The T.V. kid: was he really so horrible? I mean yes, he was obnoxious, but it doesn't take t.v. to do that. In fact, didn't t.v. just make him smart? Is it so awful that he figured out how to find the bar with the ticket? T.V. didn't turn his mind to mush, it made him the smartest kid who was just annoying and stubborn.<br/><br/>The ending: Horrible, horrible, horrible. I don't even want to talk about it."

","Absolutely awful. Sorry, it's the truth.<br/><br/>I wanted it to be good too. The original is brilliant, a timeless piece of pop culture. But what Tim Burton did to this film... OK, picture Fred Durst, Avril Lavigne, the Spice Girls, and the New Kids on the Block covering ""Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band."" Drunk. That is really how bad this film is.<br/><br/>My biggest problem with the film is that they left out Charlie's sin. I mean, no fizzy lifting drinks? C'mon!! One of the things that humanized the original Charlie, the polite and thoughtful one amongst a pastiche of brats, is that Charlie too broke the rules, and reasonably invoked Wonka's wrath. Charlie's innate good nature eventually redeems him, Also, for Darwin's sake, cut out the music. ""PAINFUL"" is the only word I can conjure to describe it.<br/><br/>I will admit that I have not read the Dahl novel, so I do not know if the original included all the drudgerous background on Wonka. However, the constant flow-killing flashbacks slows the pace of the movie to a crawl, and normally Depp's acting can carry any role, but this script and character rendering were just terrible. Perhaps the background information on Wonka should have been one big chunk in the beginning of the movie, because spacing it out has no build-up value at all.<br/><br/>Also, worst voice on a Depp character, well, ever.<br/><br/>There really was nothing to redeem this piece-of-crap moneysucker. I can't believe I actually wasted $12 to see it. Between this, ""The Stepford Wives,"" and ""Godzilla,"" I have lost all faith in the movie industry."

About the only things in our opinion that had improved over the 1971 version was the visual effects - these were excellent; and giving some background to some of the characters was also a good idea.<br/><br/>Overall given that we could only bear to watch the first hour, I would say, don't waste your money - go and rent the 1971 version from the local video store."

The opening scene was absolutely riveting, showing the wrapping of bars of chocolate. I almost fell off my sit because I was so intrigued. The beginning of the film surpassed itself in making us realize by about 2 minutes of it that it was going to be absolutely dreadful. The real fun began when we met Willy Wonka. I won't say who he reminded me of.. anyone who's seen the film would know and I don't want to spoil the pleasant surprise for those of you who haven't yet had the honour. The oompaloompa dances were possibly the worst things I have ever seen. Who choreographed them?! I want to meet this insane idiot! It literally made me want to puke.

","I'm not sure if this is a SPOILER or not, but my opinion. I was really looking forward to seeing this. I like Johnny Depp and I loved the original. I was very disappointed in this for several reasons. 1) I thought it was going to be a Part II and not a remake. Why remake something that was already great? Why not make a movie as Charlie himself grown up and running the factory. 2) Depp is quirky in a freaky, irritating kind of way, often resembling Michael Jackson in a strange way. 3) They ruined all the great songs that were in the original, with completely new, completely irritating, please turn the *@#$ off, it's killing me, kind of songs. 4) Kudos to the one guy who played ALL the oompa loompas.... again pretty strange looking and very digitized.... i like the originals much better instead of exact clone of one. 5) They changed the idea of a lot of the scenes completely... no bad/golden egg for example, no everlasting gobstoppers. 6) My kids didn't like it much either and looked kind of disturbed after the show."

","Although this movie stays close to the book, it's much darker than the book or the original, despite the original including a scene with a chook getting its head chopped off.<br/><br/>Depp is a strange Wonka. He has no interest in children and only became a chocolatier as revenge to his father's abhorration of sweet things, because he was a dentist. Depp's Wonka is much darker than Wilder's portrayal, and it's one that probably caused nightmares.<br/><br/>The Oompa Loompas are played by one person who is CGI cloned a thousand times. He's not even cute! Having the same Oompa Loompa is repetitive and annoying- some variety would've been nice. The songs they sing take the lyrics directly from the book but aren't as catchy as the original's songs. I do like the different genres of music used though.<br/><br/>The children are just as annoying as you'd expect them to be. Freddie Highmore is wonderful as Charlie, although he doesn't come across as the centre of the movie as one might expect. The demise of each child is the highlight of each segment and really moves the film along nicely.<br/><br/>Where the film strays from the book are the parts that annoy me the most. Violet being overly competitive seems out of place, and the subplot with Wonka and his father is silly. It has no place in the film and delays the inevitable ending, which everyone already knows. Delaying it with an out-of-place subplot is completely pointless and unnecessary.<br/><br/>So why don't I like the movie? It's too dark. Wonka is a happy, loving, hyperactive character. Depp's Wonka meanders through his factory like a robot and the occasional amusing comment (when he's not having flashbacks to his demented childhood).<br/><br/>Give it a miss and see the original. Better still, read the book!"

Anyways, I do believe they could have done better for the role of Willy Wonka! Much better. You can really tell this was a Tim Burton movie. The coloring, the acting, and the sets. How about that house?? Seemed like one small touch to it and it would just fall like a deck of cards. How can Charlie really sleep with the roof open like that? (Yea, I know, it is a fantasy book) The Oompa Loompa scenes were terrible! It was interesting that the same guy played ALL of the Oompa Loompas but the dance scenes were just plain awful. Just another part which downgraded this movie. But back to the fact that he played ALL of the Oompa Loompas, would it have hurt to get more than ONE person to play the parts??!? At least in the Mel Stuart version, they got a bunch of them to play the parts and some of them couldn't speak English! OK, time for the good parts. Tough to do. I would give this movie an 8 for the special effects. The glass elevator for instance. Traveling throughout the factory and even through the town with rockets. Nice.

","What. What the deuce. What the diddly deuce did I watch? Tim Burton--you're married to Helena Bonham Carter. You've made several Gothic-cutesy movies which, while decidedly not my style, are not bad. Why did you have to put your cold, spidery hands on my darling Charlie and the Chocolate Factory? WHY?? Charlie's not a bad actor. His parents, although rather predictably cast, are cute in that dingy-British-zany-Tim-Burton way. The humor at first is pretty funny. I'm not in love, but I'm not screaming in agony either.<br/><br/>And then Johnny Depp comes. And then Johnny Depp comes. And THEN JOHHNY COMES AND OH, DEAR GOD, I'M BREATHLESS WITH HORROR. He smirks. He simpers. He minces. He speaks in a soft, breathy, braindead sort of voice which seems like a really poor interpretation of Michael Jackson. He's apparently the son of a psychopathic dentist who refusd to let him eat candy--as a result of which, he grows up to be a highly effeminate, suspiciously pedophile-ish creeper who giggles for the camera and doesn't give a darn about the children with whom he's dealing. In short, he's quite possibly the worst Willy Wonka anyone could ever be, ranking right up there with the hypothetical interpretation by Kristen Stewart. Somewhere out there, Dahl is banging his head against his coffin. Personally, I'm a fan of the original. Sure, it changes a few details of the book, sure the Oompa Loompas are green and orange and creepy, sure the infamous Boat Scene is acid-trippy and psychedelic, but the heart is there. Gene Wilder, in my view, played Wonka brilliantly. He was a man of mystery, a man of twinkling eyes and dry humor and unaccountable twists and turns, a man both fearful and wonderful to behold. (By the way, Johnny: dry wit does not equate to you smiling vapidly at the children and lisping ""I don't really care""). He's peculiar, yes, but he's also wacky and whimsical and boyish at heart, and he cares for Charlie. Perhaps Depp's portrayal cared for Charlie, but he gave the impression of said caring being entirely the wrong way. I don't understand why at the end Wonka doesn't allow Charlie to bring his family with him to the factory--that rather defeats the purpose of the book. All in all, this is a shiny new remake which emulates its main character: cold and glassy and completely dissatisfying.<br/><br/>PS. The Oompa Loompas. SERIOUSLY?! And the music completely ruins the mood and setting."

","I was pleased to have this ""Willy Wonka"" re-make meet my expectations. Those expectations were high, at least in the visuals department. I expected a wild, colorful ride with brilliant hues and good special effects...and I was not disappointed.<br/><br/>It was inventively fun with those great visuals and another wonderful kid playing ""Charlie."" I doubted they could ever come up with another child as appealing and nice/wholesome as one in ""Willy Wonka"" but they found one in Freddie Highmore. He filled the bill magnificently, as did the ""brat"" kids.<br/><br/>A different feature of this version, as opposed to the 1970 original, was that here the Oompa-Loompas were all played by just one person, a very small Indian man named Deep Roy. One of the interesting ""features"" on the DVD details how difficult that was to do and how much time Roy had to put in to do all the things he did.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp, meanwhile, ""did"" what he always does - do a good job of playing a weird person. I get the feeling he relates easily to strange characters. He seems to play enough of them. This was the only part of the movie, frankly, where I preferred the 1970 version: the role of Willy Wonka. Yes, Depp was interesting as always but a little too weird, too Michael Jackson-like, for my tastes. I'll take Gene Wilder's take on the character.<br/><br/>Otherwise, this re-make has it all over the original, simply because it has 35 years of technology and computer work that the original wasn't able to have. It made this re-make a real ""hoot"" to watch. Since entertainment is what the business is called, and this movie is extremely entertaining, then I have no complaints. A fun two hours!"

","Director Tim Burton has come a long way since his first job as an animator for Disney in the early 1980's. He made several animated shorts, none of which were deemed suitable for children - an early indication of Burton's dark outlook. However, his hard work and talent did not go unnoticed. His subsequent directorial work on Beetlejuice (1988), Batman (1989) and Batman Returns (1992) cemented his role as an experimental and visionary director/producer. Nobody else, therefore, was surely more suitable to adapt Dahl's much-loved novel, and nobody else was surely daring enough to attempt a re-make of Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory (1971, directed by Mel Stuart), that enduring classic starring Gene Wilder as Wonka.<br/><br/>Burton's repeated use of Depp in previous films (Edward Scissorhands, Ed Wood, and Sleepy Hollow to name just three) indicated him to be an obvious and, it could be argued, perfect choice to cast as Wonka. Depp is by far the best thing about this film. His character's whole persona - the costume and body language, the tone of his voice, his pithy lines delivered in a contemptuous and yet charming manner, are all presented in such a way to add up to a well deserved challenge to Wilder's crown. But does he steal it? I'd say he doesn't. For someone that grew up with Roald Dahl's novels and film adaptations, Wilder IS Wonka. Trying to ignore my obvious bias, I believe Depp does put up a good fight, and perhaps if the parents of the four terrible children had shown more spark, or been actors of a higher calibre, his comic moments would have had much more impact.<br/><br/>Burton's other muse, Helena Bonham Carter, is mis-cast as Charlie's mother. Her lines are delivered distractedly and with the air of someone very aware of her status in the film industry. Thankfully her role is quite minor and doesn't impact negatively upon the film. Freddie Highmore is fairly insipid, yet not offensive in his role of Charlie. The same description can be applied to David Kelley, who plays his Grandpa Joe. With the exception of Augustus Gloop, whose role is comparatively minor, the four ticket-winning children do not live up to expectations or standards set in the '71 Mel Stuart version. They simply serve to mildly irritate and disappoint, particularly Veruca and Violet. But I doubt anyone could match Julie Dawn Cole, the original Veruca.<br/><br/>A certain amount of furore has surrounded Deep Roy, the 4ft 4"" tall actor who plays every single one of Wonka's all-singing, all-dancing Oompa Loompas. He also plays Wonka's therapist and, in a tongue-in-cheek moment, appears briefly on the closing sequence where he is revealed to be the narrator. The effects used to re-produce Roy as every single Oompa-Loompa I believe detract from the film. When viewing scenes, surely it's preferable to be absorbed and involved than to be distracted by special effects and wondering 'how/why did they do that?' Additionally, Roy's scenes are the only ones to feature music - there is no Wonka or Grandpa Joe breaking into song and dance in this adaptation. All we get here are the Oompa-Loompa's didactic lyrics, which unfortunately are drowned out by below-par sound editing.<br/><br/>In an unprecedented move, Burton and screenwriter James August have given Wonka a history. Christopher Lee, who is sadly under-used in this film, plays his father, and we get to find out exactly why Wonka is such an enigma. I won't reveal the outcome, short of saying it's pretty unsatisfying and takes away Wonka's mystery - the very thing that makes him appealing. Claims have been made that this adaptation follows Dahl's novel much more closely than the 1971 version, of which it does - everything is followed almost to the letter. Unfortunately, the Wonka/father storyline clearly undermines any attempt the film has made to stay true to Dahl's novel - should Dahl had wished there to be a father figure, he would have included that in his book. However, certain artistic license is always taken when adapting books and plays to the big screen, and this creativity is needed to keep images and story lines fresh and to prevent any static grounding.<br/><br/>As regards the imagery of the film, well, it's a Burton film and true to form we aren't disappointed. Typically, we enter and leave the film during gentle snow-fall. The poor Buckets' house leans pitifully to one side and almost makes you shiver when Charlie climbs into bed underneath a gaping whole in the roof. Colour is suitably hued down apart from certain scenes in the factory where the vibrant colours bring the songs and sets to life - the Chocolate Room and the Boat Ride come alive, and the Television Room almost blinds. The only fault I could find, and it is minor, is that at certain points of the Chocolate Room scene, the chocolate river where Augustus Gloop meets his untimely suction looks more like brown water than creamy chocolate. Apart from the afore-mentioned poor sound editing of the featured songs, audio here is of a top standard. Sound effects are clear, no dialogue is gone unheard and the musical score is in keeping with the tone of the film.<br/><br/>Verdict - It's easy to be over-picky when comparing a film not only to a novel, but also to an earlier, much loved and highly-established film adaptation. However, faults notwithstanding, this is watchable fare that should appeal to all ages. Is it a classic? No."

My kids actually have the book and I read through it right after watching the DVD.<br/><br/>This film may be more true to the book with some of the finer details (the original lyrics to the Oompah Loopah songs, Charlie having a living father who worked at a toothpaste factory), none of these details add anything to the story.<br/><br/>On the other hand, the creepy, gray-skinned, androgynous Wonka is nothing like the original character in the book. He hates children (so why does he want to give the factory to one?). He can't even say the word ""parents."" He even hates old people. There is absolutely nothing funny, amusing, or likable about him (BTW, the dialogue in the movie is purely awful). By the time there's a feeble attempt to redeem Wonka's character at the end, it's too late. And where were the childhood flashbacks of Wonka in the book? So much for ""more true to the book.""<br/><br/>I saw the 1971 movie as a kid, and enjoyed it. But I watched it many years later as an adult, and LOVED it. There's so many great lines in it that I missed as a six-year-old. If you read a little about the history of the making of the movie (look online), you'll find that the script at one point was originally developed more for adults than children. It's no wonder, because much of the humor is more geared for adults.<br/><br/>Wilder plays the role of ""Wonka"" like it was made for him. Also, I believe the 1971 film story additions made for a much better story than the original book, and allowed you to see much further into the characters. Maybe I feel this way because I saw the movie before reading the book, but who can ever forget the scene near the end where Charlie shuns the opportunity for ill-gotten gains, even with his own Grandpa encouraging him to do the opposite.

","Let me begin by stating that I am a Johnny Depp fan. I generally find his performances to be excellent, and count his portrayal in ""Blow"" among my very favorite in cinema history.<br/><br/>That said, he fails here.<br/><br/>I don't know if it was due to improper or misguided action of the director, or if he chose his own tone and manner for the Wonka character, but Depp fails miserably in this film. Using the Roald Dahl novel as a guideline, Depp is nothing like the understated, dry-witted implacable and imperturbable Mr. Wonka. Using the original film from 1971 as a guideline, Depp can't hold a candle to Gene Wilder's performance, which, while overstated, at least resembled the character intended by Dahl when he wrote the book in the first place.<br/><br/>Johnny seems to be going for some sort of post-abused, mentally tweaked boy-man. Some have said that the portrayal reflects Michael Jackson. If so, WHY? Wonka isn't sinister, nor does he come off as a character hiding a brutal truth, which is how Depp plays him here. Unfortunately, he becomes the focal point of the movie and the ""main"" character is kicked to the curb shortly after his introductory sequence. Following Charlie's find of the Golden Ticket, he becomes an ancillary character with few lines, and Michael Jackson takes over, and ruins the film. Really, he ruins it. I found it unenjoyable and actually began to resent Depp's every appearance with a weariness.<br/><br/>This is no Wonka. This is Burton and Depp's idea of what Neverland would have been like if Michael Jackson chose to make chocolate there rather than exhibit exotic animals between kiddie rides.<br/><br/>The usual Burton mosaic of backdrop works well, and the musical scenes with the Oompa Loompas are highlights, although I found myself harboring nostalgic thoughts for the original Oompas as I enjoyed these new rocked-up songs. Well done, just much, much different.<br/><br/>A sidenote: I love that Mike Teavee challenges Wonka's notion that a candybar being teleported is a far cry from an image being transmitted. That drove me nuts when I was a little kid! Good for you for calling him out, Mike! I also love that Veruca Salt meets her match by the paws of many squirrels (as in the book) rather than being dumped down the egg hatch (as in the 1971 version of the film).<br/><br/>Overall, I disliked Depp's portrayal so much that despite the excellent imagery and the many highlights, I won't watch this again, and recommend it only to those who are interested in comparing it to the far superior 1971 effort."

A magical menagerie of color and wit with some very dark and eerie elements, this is a refreshing change from the very happy go lucky type movie that made up the original. While no one will ever be able to replace the truly amazing Gene Wilder as quirky chocolatier Willy Wonka, Johnny Depp adds new life and oddity to the character. The character of Charlie was wonderfully cast, using young Freddie Highmore to play him. The necessary chemistry required to make a movie actually work was extremely noticeable between Depp and Highmore because of their work together in the drama ""Finding Neverland"".<br/><br/>All in all I thought ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" was a wonderful movie but definitely not for the children."

","when i first went to the screening for this movie i was expecting it to be crap like the trailers suggested but i was surprised by how well made it is. this is an amazing movie that shows director Burton at his best. you all know the story by now so i won't waste time going over it. what i love about this movie is how they kept the things that made the original movie great and also added in their own wonderful stuff. the trailers and TV ads make Wonka look like an idiot or some freak but he's actually a pretty sweet man that's funny as hell. the kids are great too, although they get a bit annoying at times. danny elfman's music was also well done, it's not as good as the one he did for scissorhands but it still holds it own and the set design was amazing from start to finish.<br/><br/>this is a great movie that's well shot and done in every way. it might just be the first remake since dawn of the dead that doesn't suck"
"pocketrockets","10","89","171","18 July 2005"," Deeper Story and Amazing Visuals = Winner
","Story- The screenplay is closer to Dahl's original book, but it does more - This new version of Charlie and the Chocolate factory plays on a deeper level, as we learn more about Willy Wonka. This movie fills in the gaps of the 70's version and makes many things clear from start to finish. From that, what we get is a deeper story, which is what we all want in a movie. That's what makes this so good. It doesn't end so abruptly like the first movie did. We all know that Charlie wins the chocolate factory but by the end of the movie, the real winner is Willy Wonka himself.<br/><br/>Acting- Perhaps its the charisma and great acting of Johnny Depp that makes it so incredible. He does a great job in every frame with his facial expressions. I also liked the new Charlie Bucket by Freddie Highmore; he brings a special innocence to the screen. Its nice to have Charlie's dad in the movie, as he was in the book. Grandpa Joe is very cheesy esp. when they find the golden ticket, but what do you expect? A lot of the characters are cheesy because we know the story, and know what's going to happen, so the writers and actors just have fun with that. The 4 other children are very similar to the old movie which works perfectly. And I laughed out loud every time the Oompa Loompas started to sing, cause we all know they are going to and the new songs are so cheesy. <br/><br/>Visuals- Charlie and the Chocolate Factory boasts visuals and special effects from scenes in the book that the original movie could not do. The nut room which was in the book, was in this movie. Fudge Mountain was shown, and much more CG images that Dahl envisioned. Even the opening credits are fun to watch. With more visuals, more can be shown and thus explained. Its visuals and story work hand in hand.<br/><br/>Overall - Go see this movie. If you appreciate a good movie that makes you think and somewhat cry, you will enjoy this. I generally dislike Tim Burton's work, but this is an exception I think anyone will like. I believe this movie was better than the first and am sure you will agree too."
"JDeMattei-1","1","11","16","1 March 2008"," Unbelievable
","This movie was unbelievable. Tim Burton took a great story and absolutely destroyed it. This was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I have to be honest and the fact that I love ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"" and were constantly comparing the two contributed highly to my opinion. I am sure i would have disliked the film either way, but I hated it when I compared the two.<br/><br/>Willy Wonka, instead of being a nice but eccentric individual, is portrayed as a sadistic, mentally retarded man. The OOmpa LOOmpas, instead of being cute and benevolent, are portrayed as futuristic and violent troublemakers. The biggest disappointment however is Charlie Bucket himself. In the 1971 film, Charlie was portrayed as a gentle child, very poor, living with his mother and two sets of bed-ridden grandparents. Most importantly, his character was believable. In the 2005 film Charlie is apparently supposed to be the perfect child. The performance is so over-the-top and sappy that it's not even remotely believable.<br/><br/>To top everything off, for some reason Burton decided that adding a back story about Willy Wonka's relationship with his father was a necessary addition. Unfortunately, this just made no sense, was completely irrelevant to the story except to add a Hollywood ending where everybody reconciles and live happily ever after.<br/><br/>The bottom line is that after watching the 1971 film, I have a feeling that I just watched something magical. From the story, to the characters, to the design, everything about the 1971 film makes me feel good. On the other hand, after viewing the 2005 film by Tim Burton, I literally felt physically ill. Frankly, if it weren't for the fact that I wanted to compare both films, I never would have watched the entire thing. I could tell it would be a horrible film after the first few minutes.<br/><br/>Don't buy this film unless you need a shiny new frisbee or coaster."
"l-r-brosky","4","17","27","28 November 2005"," Wonka's New Candy: Sweet or Sour?
","Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is not another version of the 1971 movie. It has nothing to do with the former movie and is supposed to be adapted from Road Dahl's novel. However, the new movie takes a cute and imaginative children's book and begins to twist it into a weird, disturbing and slightly aggressive movie. If the movie had dove into the idea and had created a dark movie, I would have respected the 2005 movie much more. Yet, the movie was spineless, the center of a tug-of-war match between the dark-side and children's fantasy.<br/><br/>Charlie and the Chocolate Factory could have been an amazing adventure for both children and children at heart, or it could have been an amusing film for those who enjoy dark humor. The film's portrayal of Willy Wonka was that of a mysterious young man with a dark-side. This could have created a great canvas for a movie in which Wonka acts according to his personality; however, the film just flip-flops from a cheesy and generic scene of a (spoiler warning!) happy ending to a stirring character pulling his audience into a dark, disturbing world.<br/><br/>If this movie would have firmly chosen a path, it would have been an excellent movie. This movie can be enjoyable to children or to adults, yet does not greatly appeal to either age group. If the movie had been created to create a land of ""pure imagination"", children of all ages would rave about the film for years to come. If it had been created in order for a peculiar audience to ponder over, the movie could have created a dark enough movie to be mused over. However, this film wasn't brave enough to choose its own category, therefore can't be completely enjoyed by many solid minds"

","I went to see this film as I am a big Johnny Depp fan, but I was completely turned off by the whole thing. The pace was so slow I was almost asleep, and I kept waiting for the magical moments to happen. Alas, they never did. The opening went on for ever and a day - remember the wonderful entrance Gene Wilder makes in the original? Well, Willy Wonka's entrance here, with the stupid ""song"" of the puppets, was just dire. He actually looked embarrassed to be there. The parents of the ""lucky winners"" were one-dimensional to say the least, and although the child actors were OK they were nothing to write home about. My 11 year old son went with me to see this film, and as we came out of the theatre I was wondering what he would have to say about it (and whether I would have to pretend that I had liked it!) but the first thing he said was, ""Well, that's not the best film I've ever see. Bit of a disappointment really."" I just felt that the director had wasted so many opportunities, not to try to emulate the first film, but to bring some fresh magic to the wonderful story. Instead, all we got was long-drawn out scenes, bad dialogue and a faintly embarrassed Johnny Depp."

I have no desire to be negative about Johnny Depp's considerable gifts; it's rather the film's monstrous concept that's the problem, though I've no idea whether this or the 1971 Wilder version is closer to the book original. While Gene Wilder's 1971 version is a not-quite-so-dark delight, this darker version is needlessly and gratuitously cruel (not knowing which version is truer to the book original), kind of like the current vile, sadistic ""angry birds"" phenomenon that kids also don't need, as harshly as the cold, selfish, senseless world in which they're made to suffer already seeks their destruction. So much for the high price of post-Christian anti-God ""freedom"" (e.g. the hypocritical Star Trek delusions of godhood) where the imagined ""cure"" is vastly worse than the disease so grossly ignorantly and hypocritically condemned by lawless fascists, as the once great and literate civilization sinks ever lower into gross illiterate barbarism, as seen in this film, significantly surpassed by the 1971 rendition & its wonderful musical nature, seen at http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0067992/"

","I was extremely pleased with the new Charlie and The Chocolate Factory movie, remake of the 70's Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory. Tim Burton did an excellent job recreating the original lines and incorporating his own interpretation, which made this 2005's version exciting, comedic and entertaining. I loved the mix of characters that starred - some rookies and some vets - their roles were played magnificently. I was also very pleased with Johnny Depp's performance in relation to the original Willy Wonka. I arrived thinking his role was going to be like most every other role he's played, with his own attitude. But, it was totally different from what everyone was used to, and it was hilarious. I loved the mix of sarcasm and comedy. The audience was full of a mix of different ages and everyone was laughing and really getting into it. The end was one of the best parts because everyone thought it was going to end negatively, but of course they made it even better than the original. Everyone was on their feet and clapping for a job well done. Tim Burton, Johnny Depp - Bravo!"

","I am a big fan of the 1971 Wilder original so I finally decided after 6 years to give this version a try. I like Depp and was hoping that this movie wouldn't disappoint... it really does. I really don't care if this follows Dahl's vision closer than the original or not, it stinks.<br/><br/>There was something charming about Gene Wilder's Wonka and while the character development was less it was just better. Depp just comes across as an evil Michael Jackson like figure. Depp plays crazy very well but there is something natural about Gene Wilder in that kind of role. He didn't need to exaggerate or emphasize like Depp, the creepy is just there.<br/><br/>Clearly if you want to know more about the back story of Dahl's characters Tim Burton pays closer attention to doing that. <br/><br/>Also I think the choices for the actors was pretty inept. I like Missi Pyle and James Fox they are great character actors but the rest were pretty bad including Freddie Highmore."

","There is no heart to this movie. I had no idea what to hope for or fear. The first 30 minutes are entertaining as they mainly focus on the Bucket family, but as soon as we step foot in the chocolate factory (not nearly as lush as one would like), the film dies. The Oompa Loompas have far too much screen time and you can't understand the lyrics to most of their songs. While Johnny Depp's Wonka is humorous in his sissy way (reminiscent of his performance in Sleepy Hollow I might add), his character ""arc"" (as tiny as it is) is not believable. The golden-ticket winner kids (with perhaps the exception of Violet) do not improve upon their predecessors. I didn't mind Burton's darker interest per say, but all in all very disappointing. The highlight of the film were the costumes by Gabriella Pescucci."

Tim Burton seems to be holding back and not pursuing a clear vision with this film. Someone commented that thankfully the psychedelic boat ride had been taken out..? What?? That scene blew my mind as a kid.. way scarier than anything Tim Burton has managed to pull off.. The Umpa-Lumpas are CGI banality personified.. they are copy and paste versions of the same person scaled down to a 3rd normal height in Photoshop.. no character or humour, just stupid. Their songs were a rubbishy trip-hop flavour without any of the original's quirkiness ..and within the context of Tim Burton's otherwise song-less film, just pointless.

In the 1971, the songs Candy Man, Imagination and even the Lumpa song, were exceptional. I was really disappointed they did not use these original (1971) songs. Also Johnny Dep has a weird ""Michael Jackson the Pedo"" feel about him.<br/><br/>I liked how Gene Wilder, in the original, played with the kid until the kid gave him back the ever lasting gob stopper, then said ""You Won Charlie"", with the elevator blasting off - that really got to me. The ""you are the only one left so I guess you won"" in the 2005 version didn't work.

And Elfman's soundtrack manages to extract some of the most embarrassing tunes from the 1960s (ones that we wished would have remained buried in the deepest recesses of our memories) to add an equally memorable and entertaining audio experience. Freddie Highmore once again delivers a performance that makes us wish he will never grow up, as all young actors do. So grab your Wonka bars and golden tickets and head out to the theater.

Unfortunately, he has no educated friends who are script editors.<br/><br/>His only brilliant film, ED WOOD, is light years away from this putrid mess and was good because of the script and despite Burton.<br/><br/>One thing Burton is incapable of doing is giving a narrative momentum. In this outing, Wonka takes his children and their guardians on a tour of his factory. We follow the group from room to room and are forced to endure cataclysmically puerile songs from cloned Oompa-Loompahs, all played by the same irritating midget.<br/><br/>The film does not have the darker subplot of the original film and the wheelchair-like pacing drove me close to igniting the screen with the nearest blowtorch.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp is just wrong as Wonka. He's boring, too, because he's a ""weirdo"" who knows he's a weirdo and wants everybody else to know it, too. He's like the annoying guy at a social gathering who tells everybody how crazy he is. No, Mr. Depp, your weirdo is a bore.<br/><br/>The production design is what you'd expect for the fortune spent on this abortion and the cinematography is adequate.<br/><br/>Only the gloriously overrated Tim Burton, who has managed to pull the wool over many people's eyes for over a decade now, could make a rich concept such as this a forgettable bore and a candidate for PND (Permanent Negative Destruction).<br/><br/>As for screenwriter John August (scribe of the rancid BIG FISH), please throw your computer away and retire with Burton."

Deep Roy, THE Oompa Loompa <br/><br/>Burton's characters and depictions are dark. Not evil, per se, but just really dark. Edward Scissorhands is a great example of this. Its not an excellent movie, but you must admit that it was a VERY well told story, and thats the directors job. Facilitate the telling of a story, and make sure its done well. All of the characters lived and THRIVED in fantasy. And he (Burton) brought something to the table for them. He made them enjoyable. He made us BELIEVE the fantasy. <br/><br/>So, Tim Burton is obviously a talented director. Why am I listing him as a cause for failure in ""Charlie""? One silly little reason. HE is probably the ONLY reason the other two persons listed had anything to do with the film at all. <br/><br/>Danny Elfman is an incredibly talented composer. That goes without question. But he is NOT talented for THIS type of film, simply put. He works on projects such as ""The Simpsons"", just about anything Pee Wee, ""Weird Science"", and many others. Now I will give him this much credit. He also worked with Burton in Batman and Beetlejuice. These movies, while not famous solely for their score, were scored well all the same. But there is a limit that exists for the man that can give us the theme for The Simpsons. Batman and Beetlejuice were not too different from what ""Charlie"" was supposed to be. So what was up with the different getups for the Oompa Loompa(s)? A rock star? Come on.<br/><br/>And someone please try to justify Deep Roy! Tim Burton, in his every-so-often lapse of wisdom, cast ONE MAN as THE Oompa Loompa for the film. That way, he was SURE to focus most of his attention on the sequences in which Roy is featured, instead of the rest of the film. And so much work went into the dancing sequences... But he can't dance! This guy hasn't done anything of note for the last twenty years except ride on Burton's coattails. His performance in ""Charlie"" was forced, bland, and dry. In and of itself, it is probably is the large reason why I dislike this film.)<br/><br/>I gave it a 1 out of 10. Not because I'm being bitter, but because, honestly, the bad points drug down Depp's struggling but still joyful performance, the delightful selection of ""children"" (well cast, I believe), and anything else of merit that this film had to offer, and I honestly feel that a 1 is all it deserves.<br/><br/>Please read my post on the comment board for ""greater detail."""

A film that had beautiful, classic songs, biting humor, and a hilarious cast.<br/><br/>The answer, of course, is money.<br/><br/>This film was made for one reason -- to wring more money out of a Warner Brothers property. Why else remake a nearly perfect film? It's an insult to moviegoers and an affront to the many children who may never bother to watch the original now that they've seen this trash.<br/><br/>The thing is, the Gene Wilder version is very, very funny. Its comedy still seems edgy today. And somehow, they've managed to turn it into a movie with almost no laughs. The timing is sometimes, it seems, deliberately thrown off.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp's performance is, I think, his worst ever. It's just stupendously bad. Then again, he has basically nothing to work with, caught between plain, unfunny new dialogue, and struggling to go in the opposite direction from Gene Wilder's brilliance. I don't envy the task. But don't worry, Johnny got lots and lots of money for his troubles.<br/><br/>The new Charlie, Freddie Highmore, was decent enough in the tearjerker Finding Neverland. But here, he's just all wrong. His one acting choice seems to be ""Smile Every Time You Say Something,"" which I last saw used by Denise Richards in Starship Troopers.<br/><br/>On one hand, I wondered as I was watching it whether the movie would fare better with someone who'd never seen the original. But on the other, this film is so disjointed and strange, I'm not sure how anyone could follow it if they hadn't seen the first film. <br/><br/>The Oompa Loompa ""songs,"" if you can call them that, consist of CG clones singing the same rhyming lines over and over again. There is no narrative or melodic progression to the songs -- they are as two dimensional as cardboard cutouts.<br/><br/>Add to this bland, unimaginative mix a few ghastly changes from the earlier movie: Charlie has a father now, his family magically gets ""unpoor"" at the end by the dint of their own optimism, and Willy Wonka learns -- get ready for this one -- that families are not a bad thing.<br/><br/>It's beyond awful.

Not much to be said that hasn't been said already. First of all, Tim Burton Hasn't made a good movie since Ed Wood in 1994, and I don't foresee him ever returning to his original form. The preview for ""Corpse Bride"" that accompanies Wonka just proves that. It promises to be just a rehashing of The nightmare before Christmas. The first 20 minutes or so of this movie did have promise, especially David Kelly's performance as grandpa Joe. I know everyone will be comparing this movie more to the 1971 original adaptation rather than the book, but I cant help it. The Original was timeless, this version is extremely dated (note the hip-hopped up versions of the oompa loompa songs) the Wolper film might have strayed from the novel by adding in new songs and removing Charlie's father (Dahl himself suggested this), but it didn't invent and entire subplot such as Wonka's estranged father. The film is like someones dissertation of the story, attempting to dissect the character and explain his origins, something Dahl would have never done. The film was poorly directed, relying heavily on CGI effects. As pretty as they were they did nothing to enhance the story. When I first saw Augustus, I couldn't decide weather HE was a CGI effect or an actual actor. In fact, all the kids in this movie have a sort of eerie ""plastinated"" effect, they don't look human, Like they stepped out of the Mutter museum. My biggest problem came from Johnny Depps performance. He may be slightly more true to the character in the novel, But Gene Wilder definitely played the part better. Wilder's Wonka was subtle, sardonic, romantic, evoking Shakespeare, Keats, and Oscar Wilde. Depp appears to be on dope. If Burton wanted a wonka that sounded and acted like Dave Foley from the Kids in the Hall, he should have cast he became totally obnoxious after only a few minutes on screen, and from then on it was almost painful to watch. Sad. what do you expect? This is by far the worst summer for ""movies"" in my memory. Is is any mystery why attendance is dropping off in theaters? when 7 out of 10 movies are remakes and 10 out of 10 are terrible, why not save 50 bucks and head to the video store.

","This doesn't hold a candle to the 1971 original classic. Period. Yes the special effects are superior but beyond that it is instantly forgettable. Gene Wilder had a point that this movie had none other than a much needed cash cow for this summer's weaker box office. Johnny Depp is a good actor but this role was completely wrong for him. His choices of playing Wonka as clutzy and spaced out conflicts with the fact Willy Wonka is supposed to be a mastermind of the candy business. Then of course there is the fact Depp's Wonka looks like something out of a Marilyn Manson video no parent with even half of a brain would bring their kids near. Burton's added back story of Wonka's childhood was his standard fare of misunderstood artist who just wants to feel like he fits in the universe. The brilliance of Wilder's performance was the fact he played someone who came across as a nutcase but was in fact a misunderstood genius always a step ahead of everyone else. Then there's the Oompas and their musical numbers. Oy! Half the time it's almost impossible to understand their vocals and what they're singing. I think this movie proves the general movie going public has become as catatonic in the brain as Depp's portrayal in this film. The children and their parents in this film were equally as practically lifeless. No wonder Hollywood is having trouble right now. This is so much of an insult to the 1971 classic that it leaves you wondering what classic they'll ruin next to get an all age audience back into the theatres."

","I've been waiting for this movie to come out for ever, Tim Burton and Jonny Depp, what can possibly go wrong, I thought to myself. But I guess everything can still go wrong. This movie is probably one of Jonny Depp's worst performances, some face gestures, that's all he does in the movie. He is not brining anything to the character, he says more in the trailer than in the movie. As for Tim Burton, now I'm not really sure why he is one of my favorite filmmakers. Big Fish is one of my favorite movies of all times, along with Edward Scissors hands, and Sleepy Hollow. Unlike his emphasize on not using CG in Big Fish, the film begins with a long CGI sequence, and follows there after in the movie. I've been holding myself back not to watch the original Willy Wonka and the chocolate factory not to compare the movie to a classic. So I am judging this movie without any comparison. The sets are amazing in the movie, and the music is great, but at times I would've rather listen to a more playful music as oppose to an over dramatic music. The songs where really not that impressive either. I guess I can not point out what I liked about the movie. Freddie Highmore is amazing and great, but I didn't even think he had a fair role, not much to say, not much to do. I guess, i can say overall, that I am just sorry to be so disappointed."
"Myrilandel","8","19","33","23 July 2005"," Satisfying Treat in a Lovely, Shiny Wrapper
","First off, I would really like to emphasize that this movie is *not* a remake of the 1970's film. That's like saying Peter Jackson remade Ralph Bakshi's 1970's version of LOTR. It's instead a new, darker, and more cynical look at Roald Dahl's novel. Dahl's work is infamous for being darker than your average kiddy fare, so in that sense, Burton *was* being faithful to the source material. <br/><br/>Beyond that, I honestly don't care how faithfully Burton recreated the original book because what I saw on the screen was captivating, satisfying, and definitely enjoyable. The opening sequence, complemented perfectly by Elfman's quirky soundtrack, had me eager for the rest of the film. <br/><br/>The acting was great, including Depp's quirky and original take on Wonka and Highmore's heartbreakingly pure Charlie. I loved the overall look of the film, including the beautifully bright and colorful, yet still sterile, semi-dark, and slightly off-kilter, factory. <br/><br/>One major change that Burton made, which seems to be a point of contention for some, is the inclusion of a back story for Wonka which brings in Christopher Lee in a delightful cameo. While the flashbacks themselves could run a little long and make the action of the movie stutter a bit, I liked the overall story and how it influenced the eventual ending, which I thoroughly enjoyed. <br/><br/>The only complaint I really have is the lack of dialogue on the part of the children while they're in the factory. There were a few nice bits of memorable banter, but I left wishing they had had more screen time. This is especially true for Veruca, who was nowhere near whiny or demanding enough for my taste. <br/><br/>Overall, I enjoyed the movie, but wished there had been a little more to it. Still, I understand that it's difficult to pack so very much into a short span of time. While it may not be the richest treat, ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" is a solid and delicious, if a bit small, piece of dark chocolate in a shiny and eye-catching wrapper."
"LoveoftheScreen","1","27","50","26 August 2006"," A Nauseating Remake. Astonishing.
","I avoided watching this movie for a long time for mainly this reason: Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory earned a place in my heart through much thought, discussion, and rewatches. The characters were uncannily well-written and acted out. Not to mention Gene Wilder's positively brilliant acting as Wonka which is in the top 50 performances of the century.<br/><br/>Therefore, a remake of this classic film is positively unwarranted. From the previews you can tell how the whole thing is going to go. Burton's style, beloved from such masterpieces as Beetle Juice and Edward Scissorhands, is becoming more cartoonish and predictable as I felt this lands in the same seam as Sleepy Hollow.<br/><br/>Willy Wonka by Depp is portrayed as a high-pitched jerk. His clean and make-up heavy appearance is completely unattractive. There's no endearment to his personality anymore. He didn't even want to know the children's' names at when he first met them.<br/><br/>There's no more contrast. The whole film is cartoonishly creepy which just felt cheesy and half baked. I mean, I've seen his style before done well, ya know. You can tell this is a step down (or two). There's no more beauty to go along with the mystery. Everything on the screen is suspect and cold.<br/><br/>In conclusion to this small chunk of a very long list of things wrong with this film and the very principle of this film, the first Willy Wonka had a magic and brilliance that cannot be touched and should never have been in the first place. Anybody who likes this film is obviously a rookie who probably liked Batman Forever and should not be trusted.<br/><br/>It simply blows my mind that such a classic film was fooled with by an overactive ego of a director."
"gly1","1","27","50","10 December 2005"," One Bad Trip
","Would I allow my children to see this movie. No. Do I wish I had not wasted the 4 bucks to rent this movie? Yes. Virginia this is not your mother's Wonka movie. Burton must have been severely beaten as child because his view of the world is horror filled. The music is off key and just plain bad. The visuals are mostly CGI and like the latest Star Wars trilogy lacking in human emotion and reality. Johnny D's version of Wonka is Wonka as Howard Hughs. Creepy and perverse. He reminded me of some weird child molester. Don't waste your money or your time with this remake. Instead rent the original and enjoy the wonderment and beauty of true film making. The music is great and every kid that grew up seeing this favorite can hum the tunes to this day. There's a reason it's a considered a classic like the Wizard of Oz. Tim Burton and Johnny D are two very twisted men and this load of garbage is a bad egg. The original did not need to be remade. It was never broken."
"gschottmiller","2","27","50","3 August 2005"," Surprisingly Bad
","All I can say that there can be no human alive who could possibly like this version over the original version with Gene Wilder. I actually liked the movie up until Johnny Depp appeared. From there on, it was terrible and I couldn't wait for the movie to be over. I don't know what Tim Burton/Johhny Depp were thinking. First, Willy Wonka shouldn't look like he is a 30 year old transvestite. Charlie's grandfather worked for Willy Wonka decades ago, so he should look somewhat middle aged. Next, Willy Wonka is supposed to be a genius. Johnny Depp plays him like a stupid eight year old kid. I don't believe for a second he is some kind of genius. Johnny Depp is neither a likable or funny character. He is just weird. Very few funny moments. Gene Wilder's performance, on the other hand, is fantastic. He captures oddness, with humor and intelligence. The Oompa Loompas songs were simply unbearable....just awful. The rest of the cast was actually good. All the children were pretty well played. I didn't like the parents much especially compared to the original version. Veruca's dad in the first movie was much more effective. Charlie and his family were well cast, especially Charlie.<br/><br/>All in all...very disappointing. It's a poor interpretation of the book and a disgrace compared to the first movie."
"motegiracing213","1","24","44","27 July 2005"," Terrible remake of a classic
","To be quite honest, the first make of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory wasn't that much to sneeze at. With Gene Wilder playing Willy Wonka, for that time period you knew that it would be a enjoyable movie at that. But the second remake was amusing, literally. Johnny Depp's white-faced, denture wearing, womanly haircutted Willy is embarrassing to look at it in itself compared to the goofy but likable 70's Wonka. With stupid sub plots and scenes that look like hallucinations, Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory is a terrible and embarrassing mistake of a classic musical. Gene Wilder himself told press: ""Why remake a classic?"". I agree 100%. Good to see in the dollar movie or rent but definitely not worth $8.95 of my hard earned money."
"ghetarr2001","4","21","38","27 July 2005"," VERY disappointing to say the least compared to Mel Stuart's version
","I, like many others loved the original Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory. I felt connected with Charlie, and I felt as if I was the one inheriting the Factory. It was a classic, but by today's standards it looks very outdated. The main problem with Burtons ""adaptation"" of the book, was I felt he went for style over substance. Sure, this one looks better, the factory and elevator are superb, but this just ISN'T a good movie AT ALL. The oompa loopas in this one are all the same lame person(Deep Roy), and I was very upset over that, seeing as I loved the ""Oompa Loopa Doo Ba Dee Doo, I've got a Brand new puzzle for you"" songs, NOT the dreadful ""songs"" in this one. I just couldn't get into the children at all, Veruca was poorly done, same with Mike Teevee, Violet. I didn't buy Deep for 1 second as Wonka, not 1. He was just annoying, humorless, and creepy. Grandpa Joe sucked in this one for sure. There wasn't one scene where I thought that there was a reason for remaking it except for money. Then there's this pointless sub-plot with Wonka and his father. The point is, even though Mel Stuart's version steered away from the book, it made for a MUCH BETTER movie. DO NOT see this one expecting a well done movie at all, in fact it is quite the contrary."
"chazview","1","28","53","11 November 2005"," They Ruined It...
","Such a waste of good talent -- Tim Burton directing, Johnny Depp as Willy Wonka -- how could it be better? It should be great, but they ruined it. Having read and loved the book as a kid, and very much enjoying the first film version, this one doesn't cut it. It's a timeless story and didn't require ""modernizing"" -- keeping with the original story and merely updating the special effects would've been great. Willy Wonka was turned into a Michael Jackson-like character and the Oompa Loompa's were all one actor, digitally duplicated to appear as many identical characters -- the musical numbers with the Oompas were 'updated' with electronic music and Oompas attempting to disco-dance.<br/><br/>This movie is what happens when a bunch of college kids get jobs at studios, do drugs, and dig into the movie-rights vault. Fortunately, there's always the book -- and the first film version -- if anyone could've matched Gene Wilder's performance as Willy Wonka, Johnny Depp could've, but he didn't..."
"tiw","2","20","36","31 December 2005"," Weird
","The original Gene Wilder film is superb and original. A classic of its time, we have a saying in England ""if it ain't broke don't fix it"". Johnny Depp who is a brilliant actor gave me the creeps in this new version, I did not feel comfortable with my young children watching such a weird character. The props and sets are better than the original, but so they should be. Gene Wilder in the original film came across as an eccentric recluse, which was fine. This Tim Burton version went back into Willy Wonkers childhood, which I found confirmed the weirdness of the Willy Wonker/Johnny Depp part. The magic and charm of the original film, its script and story line should have been left along with the now carbon copied Oopa Loompa's."
"from_denver_co","2","20","36","20 November 2005"," No Heart
","I went into this movie wanting to like it, but after about 30 minutes I could see it was another Tim Burton-fest devoid of heart. The sets looked like Batman/Beetle Juice makeovers and overall the movie was FLAT FLAT FLAT. Burton is all about the visual and minor things like acting and story are secondary, to say nothing about his lack of understatement, which would more intimately involve the viewer. <br/><br/>Mostly, there's no >sweetness< in any of his recent movies. <br/><br/>I think there once might have been, but it's been lost somehow. The teaming with Depp and Elfman just isn't working for me anymore. Gene Wilder runs rings around Depp with his slightly-crazed/funny and yet touching portrayal of Willy Wonka. I don't really know why I'm writing this, but Burton has missed the point again."
"awendle","1","19","34","12 August 2005"," Horrible
","I loved the book and the first movie, and I was looking forward to this new movie with great anticipation. (Especially when I heard Johnny Depp was to be Willy Wonka.) However, after seeing it, I cannot imagine any way to make it worse. Willy Wonka, instead of being depicted as the eccentric genius he is supposed to be, is portrayed as a sissy pervert. He looks, talks, and acts like a cross between Michael Jackson and Pewee Herman. Grandpa Joe was also terrible. The oompa loompa songs should have been scrapped altogether, as they were the worst part of the original movie. But instead, they were transformed into some kind of Marylin Manson type freak-show. I hated it and could not wait for it to be over."
"rams_lakers","2","18","32","10 October 2005"," Another bad remake
","Once again, we are subjected to greed and self promotion as another classic gets copied by today's filmmakers who shamelessly abandon creativity.<br/><br/>First of all, let me get this off my massive chest. Yes, it is a REMAKE. The original was made in 1971. The arguments about the changing of the title or that it is closer to the book have no merit. It is a COPY of the 1971 classic with the SAME characters and basic storyline. <br/><br/>Johnny Depp's performance falls so far short of Gene Wilder's and this is obvious to everyone. Wilder's wild, eccentric, poetic, unpredictable style was superior to Depp's reclusive, socially-moronic, mumbling, flashbacking attempt. Speaking of flashbacking, was that really necessary? Christopher Lee is a fantastic actor but this is wasted on one of today's ideas of having to pick through the origin of some of the best misunderstood characters in entertainment. Why oh why do people feel the need to go back in time to see Darth Vader, the Grinch, and now Wonka's child highlights when leaving it all alone is much more mysterious?<br/><br/>The kids......2005 Charlie looks like an imp with over sized ears. Whenever I look at him I just can't get by those bat-wings! 2005 Verucca, though cute and talented, was nowhere near as bratty as the original. Making 2005 Mike Teevee a video game freak was to be in touch with the times, the original Mike was still superior. The original Violet was more obnoxious which equals better. This new one with the win-at-all-costs mentality falls short.<br/><br/>The CG-generated Oompa Loompas were a lame joke. Mass producing that goofy looking filipino was totally lame. Though their songs were taken from the book, I thought the Augustus one was OK but I remain faithful to the original Loompa songs which were far superior, humorous and ingenious. I also remain faithful to the original 1971 movie which filled me with magic and adventure as a child.<br/><br/>I also remain faithful to the original in terms of grading. 2005, made for the ignorant who missed the first one, is a failure. 2 out of 10 stars."
"jared999","1","18","32","24 July 2005"," The Worst Remake of All Time
","Johnny Depp played some cross between Michael Jackson and Gary Coleman, not the mysterious old man portrayed by Gene Wilder in the original. Depp acted disturbed and perversely childish. Tim Burton took too many liberties, significant parts of the story from the book that were included in the original were cut from this movie. The ending tried to tack on a message about the importance of family, however that failed miserably. The music was probably the worst part, the songs were not cute and catchy, but jazzy and Vegas-like, with unintelligible lyrics sung by Deep Roy (Umpa Luma). Roy was also miss-cast looked too much like a human which detracted from the illusion. Visuals took little advantage of the advances in technology over the past few decades, some scenes such as the chocolate room (chocolate meadow and river) were much more elaborate in the original despite being filmed 35 years earlier. Finally, there were a lot of inconsistencies of time and place which did not seem purposeful and detracted from the story."
"AJeffrey-1","1","18","32","21 July 2005"," Skip the chocolate
","This was an appalling movie. I think it would be terrifying and disturbing for children, not to mention the fact it is just plain creepy most of the time. I love dark movies, and couldn't believe how bad it was. I loved the book, and the original movie, but this one just plain stinks. To go from Captain Jack Sparrow to this Chester Molester character makes me not like Johnny Depp so much any more. The Oompa Loompa is just horrible - computer generated and gross. Only 4 or 5 chuckles for both myself and my boyfriend. (We're both in our 30's.) Don't waste your time, in my opinion. And if your children are easily spooked, this is definitely not the movie for them. I was most disappointed."
"charlene_1982","4","17","30","28 July 2005"," Childhood memories this ain't
","When I was 8 years old, Willy Wonka and The Chocolate Factory was my favourite movie. I'd watch it every day if I could. I didn't see it again until recently (I'm now 22), but even before I watched it, I was humming along with the songs I suddenly remembered again, and I grinned almost the whole way through when I did watch it. That movie is still a part of my childhood. Unfortunately, I don't see any 8 year old now grinning at the memory of this one in 14 years.<br/><br/>I know it's a new director, new script, new everything, and I expected it to be totally different, but it just did nothing for me. The factory is supposed to be a place of wonder and childhood dreams, but it looked more like the set of Nightmare Before Christmas done in sweets. Even in the novel there was a pause to look at something before each child left, but in this, it's just, go to a room, lose a kid, go to another room, lose another kid, until only one was left.<br/><br/>The kids did what they could with their roles, and the grandparents were pretty good, but Willy Wonka was just a little TOO weird for my taste. He was supposed to be eccentric, not they kind of guy parents drag away from their kids when they offer them a sweet! That's nothing against Johnny Depp, because he's a good actor, I just didn't like his version of Willy Wonka.<br/><br/>As for the Oompa Loompas, I wanted to shoot them every time they came on screen. It was well done, considering there was only one guy, but I couldn't stand them.<br/><br/>Tim Burton added his own unmistakable style to a very odd novel, which many people would like, and I know why. The first movie was all sweetness and colour and charm, which some people hated, and Tim Burton's version certainly has none of that. For those, this will be a far better version, more faithful to the novel in some ways (I liked the inclusion of the scene where Charlie, Grandpa Joe and Willy Wonka see the others leave the factory), but for me, this was just not up to scratch."
"pmccombs","8","17","30","19 July 2005"," The only thing missing is that wonderful smell of chocolate!
","Tim Burton has made Roald Dahl's story truly come to life. The only thing missing is that wonderful smell of chocolate. I advise taking a Wonka bar into the movie, because when you see the chocolate water fall your mouth will water. Johnny Depp does a superb job of portraying the weird and bizarre Willie Wonka who just appears as the puppets catch fire and begin to melt. He is clapping and cheering as if he had been standing there all the time. At first the children and parents are not sure who he is but slowly realize as he begins to instruct them how to enter the factory. The Bucket's ram-shackled leaning house is definitely a Tim Burton creation, and the first view we have is a classic 'mise-en-scene'. The actors portraying Augustus, Veruca, Violet, and Mike fit the parts to a tee. Freddy Highmore does another superb job as Charlie, just as he did in Finding Neverland as Peter. The digitalized Oompa-Loompas singing the catchy verses with the 'Pop Choreography' dance moves of the 'swim', the 'mashed potatoes' and the 'jerk' were nostalgic as well as entertaining. I enjoyed this version just as much as the Gene Wilder version in the 70's. I was fascinated with the squirrels cracking the nuts and throwing the bad ones away. Although it is one of the scenes that borders on the scary side, when they hold and push Veruca done the garbage tube. The glass elevator is high tech, and I loved Depp running into it every time he went to get in. It was great fun! And don't forget your Wonka bar!"
"the-jerk","9","24","45","18 July 2005"," A GREAT movie for kids and adults alike.
","Who says that a movie can't be dark and still be for kids? Sure, the original may have sugar-coated things a bit more, but it was still just as dark and disturbing as this one was! And that's OK. Has anybody heard of the Brothers Grimm? They wrote fairy tales that were still ten times as dark as this movie, and they were for kids, and many of us read them when we were kids. Kids are savvier than we give them credit for, and honestly, I think that adults would be more put off by the disturbing imagery in ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" than kids would. I saw this movie at a Friday afternoon matinée in a theater that was FULL of kids, and the reaction seemed pretty positive to me. (And as far as some of the ""hidden"" risqué jokes, I remember the same types of jokes in a lot of Disney movies from the late 80s and early 90s; it's a part of the kid's movie landscape now.) I thought it was an excellent movie, for adults or for kids. I also thought it had some touches that actually improved on the original; the set pieces were amazing, and there was more with the great glass elevator (like the book) than in the original movie, which I was pleased to see.<br/><br/>I thought I'd go into this being bored until they got to the factory because that was how I felt about the original, but even the opening scenes with the Bucket family, and Grandpa Bucket's flashbacks to his time working at the factory, are wonderfully entertaining. The unusual imagery starts there, with the gigantic factory ""ten times as big as any other chocolate factory"", and Charlie's weird, funhouse-like shack and eccentric but loving family. I was most impressed with David Kelly as Grandpa Bucket, whose performance was all child-like wonder, and Helena Bonham-Carter and Noah Taylor were also good as Charlie's parents; and Freddie Highmore, who played Charlie, ought to have a decent career in front of him.<br/><br/>Once they do get to the factory, though, things really take off. Johnny Depp puts in an excellent performance as Willy Wonka, not an impression of Gene Wilder AT ALL, but as usual, making the character his own. Without a doubt, he's the best thing about the movie, but the imagery is amazing too. It's exactly what you'd expect from a Tim Burton-made adaptation of the book; his trademark is all over everything, and the result is stunning. And the kids are great too, as are Deep Roy as every one of the Oompa Loompas, Missi Pyle as Violet's mother, David Kelly as Grandpa Bucket, and James Fox as Veruca Salt's father. From the start of the tour, the movie starts feeling like an acid trip, and the movie never lets go of that atmosphere. The result is amazing.<br/><br/>The only slow parts, I think, are those dealing with Wonka's childhood (although Christopher Lee is good as his father, I just thought they were a little boring and wanted to get back to the factory when they were on) and the Oompa Loompas' musical numbers, which I didn't think had the charm of those in the original (actually, I thought the musical number with the puppets at the beginning of the tour was the best one in the movie). The ending is also just a bit overlong, but the whole package is so good that the pluses definitely outweigh the minuses. You'll enjoy this movie, especially if you're already a fan of Tim Burton's work, but also, I think, if you're a fan of the original movie or the book; however, even kids who have never been exposed to any of this will be entertained. It's often hilarious, always a visual treat, and has something to offer for everybody."

The oompa-loompas are played by an old man (can't figure out what they were thinking). The children were zero dimensional, most of their parents had little to say, the acting was one-note at best. The only actor in the film to give a good performance is Charlie, but the script gives him little to say.<br/><br/>Yes, I am biased because I loved the original.

","There is something confusing about Tim Burton's films. When a filmmaker has a weakness, shouldn't he take it upon himself to fix and improve that weakness in their following projects? This is after all, what critics are for: to offer criticism about films and explain what works and what doesn't. Sometimes the director will be ignorant and shrug off the review with a ""screw you"" attitude and other times it may be a misunderstanding of the critics. ""No mister critic, I don't care so much about plot or characters and it's really about the visuals."" Is that Tim Burton's excuse? And if so, what's the point? <br/><br/>Tim Burton's adaptation of Roald Dahl's Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is a visually spectacular film but it's not enough to make a good film. The story is about Charlie Bucket but then its about Willy Wonka and we forget about Charlie. There's not one cut away of Charlie's reaction while being in the factory tour. The other child characters are obnoxious as Dahl intended them to be but they have no depth. They overreact on cue when it is time for them to fall into a trap and leave the others behind. There is no build up to their selfish frustrations. Its as if they see the moment where they wish to escape and die. The last twenty minutes of the film feel rushed and we have to think fast as to how Willy Wonka was so quickly welcomed by the Bucket family.<br/><br/>Critics can see why Tim Burton chose to film this story. It centers on ""eye candy."" But eye candy is not interesting for a feature if there is not much else to care about. Its like having sex without love. We get dazzling images of chocolate dripping waterfalls and strange looking Oompa Loompa figures and irritating breaks of songs and dance. I especially did'nt care for the background imagery of Oprah Winfrey and Stanley Kubrick's film, 2001. These kinds of visual details ruin the imagination by reminding you what the real world is all about. <br/><br/>There has only been one film where Tim Burton's use of storytelling and character development received critical success. That film was ""Ed Wood"". Ed Wood is the movie about the late B-movie director from the 50's who made his films from the heart without conforming to traditional narrative styles. The critics did not catch on with him and coincidentally critics have not caught on with Tim Burton' style. The film""Ed Wood"" is the only exception. One cannot help but see the irony in this."

I was extremely disappointed with the Oompa Loompa's as being cloned as one character and found the sound track not matching with these characters most of the time. The set design was great and very colorful and added to the movie. The songs that were performed were also very dry and lacked imagination. Directors are now making remake after remake because they lack the imagination to created on their own and the work is already done for them, from writing the screen play to the characters and the layout of the movie. I was very disappointed with this feature. A person should not try and compare this remake with the original or they will really be disappointed when they see it."
"Coventry","7","15","26","1 August 2005"," Another magical Tim Burton trip!
","Roald Dahl's exhilarating children's novella is brought back to life by the best possible team imaginable! If there's anyone out there in cinema land capable of re-telling Dahl's colorful  yet macabre  story, it has got to be director Tim Burton (with his unique ability to create dark, fairy-tale like atmospheres), class actor Johnny Depp (not one character is too eccentric for himnot even Willy Wonka) and music-maestro Danny Elfman (whose typical style gives an extra magical touch to every film). With these three icons of nowadays cinema involved, the new adaptation of ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" was bound to be an enormous success and definitely one of the greatest movies of the year 2005. Well, the movie didn't turn out as amazing as I hoped, but still it's a very beautiful and occasionally heart-warming experience with excellent set pieces and another highly memorable role for Depp. It's very likely that you've read the best-selling book or saw the earlier film version (starring Gene Wilder as Willy Wonka) but in case you're from another planet: Charlie Bucket, the titular character, is one of five lucky children who wins a grand tour in Willy Wonka's world famous chocolate factory. Wonka is a bit of a loner who normally never grants anyone access to his factory because there were too many competitors in the past who were out to steal his recipes. Charlie and the others enter a magical world where chocolate and other types of candy are made in the most bizarre waysand by the most bizarre kind of factory workers. The always-amazing Johnny Depp is very aware of the fact he's the star and tout of this production and he clearly is in a great shape again. His performance of Willy Wonka is very cheerful and, just as it was the case in Pirates of the Caribbean, you gladly allow him to go over the top. The young Freddie Highmore is really good as well in portraying Charlie, a boy with a limited imagination but a heart of pure gold. The screenplay contains some terrific dialogues and the (blackly tinted) humor is well spread over the whole film.<br/><br/>And yetTim Burton and C° slightly disappointed me during some moments in the film. The many flashback (for example revolving on Wonka's supposedly traumatizing childhood) are too extended and actually quite redundant. Also, some of the character drawings are definitely underdeveloped, like Grandpa Joe for example, whom we only get to know superficially. Biggest letdown of all was the ""Oompa Loompas""-tribe. These little people fail to convince and especially their morality-songs are overlong and pointless. Compared to the first cinematic version of the book, released in 1971, I personally find Burton's film slightly weaker. Sure the older film had those very annoying songs and Johnny Depp simply crushes the memory of Gene Wilder but yet the wholesome was more captivating and the pivot sequences in the 1971 version (like the boat-ride and Oompa-Loompa life-lessons) were a lot more sinister. And if there's one term that fully describes Roald Dahl's oeuvre, it is ""sinister""."

","I think this is one of those movies where you are either going to love it or hate it. I fall into the second category. I loved the Gene Wilder version of Willy Wonka as a kid (my two kids love it as well). I knew going into this that it was supposed to be different and more true to the book. I have never read the book so I can't comment on that but I found the basic story very similar. Anyway, I just didn't like this movie. You can tell right up front that it's a classic Tim Burton movie. Everything is very surreal looking. But I was just bored. I thought once they got to the chocolate factory that things would pick up but no such luck. While I generally like Johhny Depp, I didn't like his portrayal in this movie. I didn't like the way he looked or sounded. And I can definitely see the Michael Jackson comparison (although Depp has said this was not intentional). That just creeped me out even more. There were a couple of good one-liners but that was all I found redeeming about it. My mom put it on for my kids and after a few minutes they asked her if they could watch something else."

","I'm a fan of Tim Burton, a fan of Johnny Depp and a fan of Tim Burton and Johnny Depp together. I'm also a since-I-was-six fan of the classic Willy Wonka movie starring Gene Wilder. I was concerned that, despite the great experiences served up by Burton/Depp collaborations in the past, this one might fall short on sentiment and long on sarcasm growing from twisted trees. I shouldn't have worried.<br/><br/>This film is, as every Tim Burton film is, a visual feast that draws you into a world that seems a combination of the real and unreal. This is a far less sweetly musical telling of the story, but Danny Elfman's music is a perfect fit for Burton's quizzically malevolent vision. Johnny Depp delivers a performance that can only be described as subtle slapstick. His Willy Wonka is equally an eccentric genius and nervous innocent. Burton's direction removes a lot of doubt about Wonka's motivations, and makes it OK for us to love Charlie, both pity and admire Willy, and laugh guiltily at the four despicable brats who get what they richly deserve.<br/><br/>The Oompa-Loompas are not orange, a little wackier, and don't have scary theme music. The interior of the chocolate factory is less fun house and more never-ending stainless fortress. Charlie's family is featured more, and you find yourself wishing you could crowd around that big bed with them. Smaller children (under 7 years old) may be frightened by the puppet show, the boat ride or Veruca's squirrel scene, and unimpressed by some of the more nuanced humor. <br/><br/>The classic is more ""pure imagination,"" this one is more flaming puppets. The classic shows Willie Wonka working in his office, this one shows Willie Wonka discovering the Oompa-Loompas. It's quite unlike the prior film in it's look, tenor and musical treatment, but the overall theme of the good at heart winning out over the good for nothing is the same. It's wonderfully delicious.<br/><br/>>> SPOILER ALERT <<<br/><br/>There's no last temptation of Charlie in this film (he doesn't enter any forbidden rooms), so that means no last minute tongue-lashing from Willie Wonka at the end. Instead, we're taken along on an examination of Willy Wonka's life, and wonder if he will truly shun all notions of family and the outside world forever. This part is all Burton, not Roald Dahl, but is an interesting insight into what might have made Willie Wonka the way he was, and whether the one principal he rejected in order to create his perfect world must be ultimately embraced in order to enlarge it and make it better."

","I saw the movie on IMAX through a radio station. I was optimistic about going because the theater was far away, But after it was over I was glad I went. The movie was in my opinion better than the original. Tim Burton directing it made the movie good, but Johnny Depp made it even better. The movie was also great because it followed the book more than the Willi Wonka and the Chocolate Factory. The Characters and Factory made it seem very much like a Rohl Doll which is why this one is a fun, wacky, and hilarious movie. If you see this movie I bet you'll be laughing the whole time. The timing of the movie was also nice because the movie was almost exactly 2 hours with previews an the beginnings of the credits."

","Spoilers below:<br/><br/>I bought the DVD today as my family and I all love the original film and book. I was hopeful when I saw that it was meant to be truer to the book, but frankly this is not accurate. The book was quirky and fun, this film is dark and dull and even the storyline varies from the original source.<br/><br/>One of the worst parts, is the normally excellent Johnny Depp. He was truly terrible in this role and came across as a retarded, antisocial creep. The children's personalities are not explored well and the parent's even less. They hardly show any emotion when the various children fall foul of their own actions. The music is dire and the vocals are unintelligible.<br/><br/>Tim Burton introduced a totally unnecessary back-story that attempted to explain the weird personality of Willy Wonka. It seems having a dentist for a dad, who doesn't allow you to eat sweets, turns you into a Peter Pan/ Michael Jackson undead sweet factory owner.<br/><br/>The only redeeming feature of this film are the sets. However, with 35 years of CGI advancements, they are not as good as I expected and are not much better than in the first film.<br/><br/>Overall, if you are a fan of the original, do NOT watch this film as it will only disappoint. Only a die hard Tim Burton fan would think this is better than the original and Gene Wilder is infinitely better than Johnny Depp who despite his considerable talent, cannot save this garbage."
"drrap","1","22","41","15 July 2005"," It's a mercy that Roald Dahl never lived to see this piece of dreck
","What a sad occasion. I should say at the start that Johnny Depp is one of my favorite actors of all time, and that -- until his last three films -- Tim Burton was one of my two favorite directors (the other being Terry Gilliam).<br/><br/>I'm sure Depp will go on to make many more superb films -- but I have no desire to ever see another Tim Burton film again. This film is not only untrue to the book, most monstrously so in its ending (which I can hardly bring myself to describe) but really throughout the film in its cheap, unimaginative, eye-candy.<br/><br/>Depp, apparently channeling a frightening mixture of Pee Wee Herman and Anthony Perkins (thus perhaps the gratuitous ""Psycho"" reference in the film?), is neither charming nor surprising; he lacks the sly warmth of Gene Wilder, who to my mind will *always* be the real Willy Wonka. His factory, resembling the assembly lines of ""Edward Scissorhands,"" but on steroids, is a vast, impersonal cavern, without a single ring of emotional truth. Sure, all the kids but Charlie are brats -- but here, Willie Wonka is one too, and though Charlie may be a good boy, he gets very few speaking lines, and he and Grandpa Joe have as few occasions for fun as do we, the viewers.<br/><br/>During production, Burton talked about how he disliked the older version, and seemed to promise a darker version truer to Dahl's witty disdain for the the adult world. But here, everyone -- child, adult, and elderly person is insulted with visions whose ""darkness"" is not a product of melancholy, but of cynicism. There is no goodness here, no meaningful badness either. The first flashback to Wonka's dentist father (Chrisopher Lee, wonderful as ever) is a lovely touch, but the ending of the film, which demands that little Charlie somehow ""heal"" the wounded psyche of Wonka and re-unite him with his dentist dad, is the worst piece of poisoned treacle ever to leave a factory.<br/><br/>The whole thing ought to be flushed down a garbage chute -- it's a bad nut."
"skylar667","2","13","22","28 July 2005"," Not what I expected...
","Was it just me or did Johnny Depp sound exactly like Michael Jackson? Even the billboard I saw after viewing the movie reminded me of the MJ look. I've always been a Johnny Depp fan, but I can't give him high marks for this one. The film had highlights of added humor and far more flashbacks than the life of Charlie. Wonka is depicted as a lunatic and the film lacks a good moral story. The humor in some scenes revolves around immoral acts such as Charlie's father stealing caps from the toothpaste factory.<br/><br/>Slugworth didn't lurk around each golden ticket winner, so there wasn't any temptation for the children to be deceptive. Instead the film revealed that all of the children were ""rotten"". This area of the film perturbed me. There was no character building, learning from mistakes, or any scruples to to this wonka story except, ""you won Charlie because you were the least rotten kid"" <br/><br/>The classic songs were replaced with either flashbacks or humorous antics such as the grampa dancing like the Six Flags Commercials.<br/><br/>As the children enter the factory there was this somewhat amusing set up with singing toy dolls, yet it self-destructs and the toys catch on fire. You could literally see the dolls melt and eyeballs sliding off! Once that happened, it was not amusing but sick. Willy wonka was right there behind them, ready to pull out his cue cards to begin the explanation of his factory, you would think he would know what to say, but for some reason his role in this film was to be the look alike MJ insane guy, with a horrible father who would not allow him to eat chocolate. As far as I could tell that was the only reason he ran away from home.<br/><br/>Gene Wilder from the original was not insane, but funny, goofy, playful, and serious when it came to someone stealing his ingredients. On the other hand Depp just didn't like kids and really expressed that with Mike TV when he kept pretending that he didn't even hear him.<br/><br/>Other than Mike bringing his wimpy dad and Violet bringing her baton twirling mom, the others brought the same gender of parent as the original. The differences were in acting abilities. Other than Mike TV and Charlie, the kids did not act with as much intensity as the original and the parents did not show a great sense of loss or love as their children were stretched or juiced. It seemed as if they went along with Wonka and knew their kids were rotten. For example, Augustus's mom didn't scream out like she did in the first one as he is being sucked up through a pipe. Veruca's father had to be pushed into the ""bad nut"" shoot by a squirrel. Yes I said squirrel. They changed the 'golden egg' to nuts and a bunch of nut crackers - squirrels. The motif of insanity is played on in that scene. Mike TV did not say anything once he was removed from the TV by his father as a little person. His father didn't reflect much facial emotion when they announced he would need to go through the taffy puller machine. The Granpa was OK, but not as 'into' it as the first one. Veruca didn't put her whole heart into being the spoiled brat, she was a little better when she was trying to get a squirrel, but once they carried her to the shoot, her acting abilities were lessened.<br/><br/>The Oompa Loompas were all the same guy - just duplicated and were not midgets, but little men. Their music was different and included many wardrobe changes and even swimming formation acts. They sang after each child disobeyed and made up a song including their name. They left out the Oompa Loompa song - one of my favorites. The oompa loompa also posed as Wonka's psychologist, another indication that Wonka was a little off.<br/><br/>The improvements were the special effects of the elevator and utilizing it during several scenes instead of just the last one. Also, showing the characters leave the factory at the end, was an added plus.<br/><br/>The bubble scene where Charlie and Grandpa fly up was not on this film, and most likely because that was a character building part of the original, where Charlie learned from his mistake and did the good deed giving back the gobstopper. He showed honesty, bravery, and selflessness Burton's film did not show that heart, softer side. It was all about colors.<br/><br/>The added storyline was the relationship between Wonka and his father, which was less than entertaining. Every time there was a flashback, Wonka would black out, thus indicating his further entrapment to insanity. He was reunited with his father at the end of the movie and found enough forgiveness to accept Charlie's family into his factory, but they still kept their little crooked house and moved it into the factory. That was strange - you would think they would have given that up! The other added story was how Wonka found the Oompa Loompas and saved them, yet made them his slaves for chocolate.<br/><br/>Overall I did not see a real moral strength to this film, but merely colors, lights, and sounds... but even the sounds weren't as good as the classic music featured in the original. The children were made out to be brats, with Charlie being the ""less rotten"" of the bunch thus winning the prize. So it would seem it is a typical Hollywood film reflecting what our society, or is it a reflection of what our future holds... uncaring parents, rotten children, and no emphasis on morals."

","I'm sorry I went into this film thinking that I would love it like all the critics views I read. However, this was one of the worse movies I think I've ever witnessed. It was boring & so over the top, I just couldn't get into it. Johnny Depp as always was good but the voice he used for Willy Wonka was irritating. It was to the point that at the end of the film I wanted to reach in & choke Willy Wonka just so I wouldn't have to hear the voice anymore. The coloring didn't make any sense either, he was always either green, blue or pale colored. Depended upon what scene he was in. He just looked sickly. He had absolutely no redeeming qualities whatsoever. I didn't see the need for the incredibly stupid flashbacks to his childhood. It made no sense in the picture & was irritating. The Umpahs were OK... I didn't like the singing because most the time we couldn't understand what they were singing about. I thought the kids were fairly good. I really liked this kid who played Charlie much better than the original... he was good. I've always been a fan of Tim Burton but I know he's done much better."

","This movie was supposedly meant to follow Roald Dahl classic children's book? I'm not sure what book they're following, but there's stuff in this film that would make poor Mr. Dahl gag on an Everlasting Gobstopper.<br/><br/>This is easily the weakest work for both Tim Burton and Johnny Depp. Burton simply has no concept of the joyous celebration and positive message of the original manuscript. Instead, he delivers a mean spirited and misguided interpretation that is needlessly grim and depressing. Depp appears to be concocting a character which is a grotesque montage of The Wicked Witch of the West, Michael Jackson, and Carrot Top. He always has some psychotic expression on his face which distracts you from the main story. The Oompa Loompas (really one guy multiplied by awful CGI) are sinister looking, and their songs stink. The children vary from boring to annoying. <br/><br/>As if this isn't bad enough, the script includes ugly back stories about Wonka that add nothing, disrupt the flow of the story, and transform a character originally written as well-intentioned but cautiously secretive into a vile, selfish, brutal freak of nature devoid of any redeeming qualities at all. The tacked on sequence about Wonka's family problems is just excruciatingly painful to sit through. A definite misfire on this one."

A young kid behind us was crying because one part was so freaky. I wouldn't recommend taking young children to this movie.

His character is somewhere between homosexual and the devil himself. Willy Wonka was supposed to be neurotic, not evil and mean spirited. In fact, the only good character in the whole movie is David Kelly as Grandpa Joe. I can even deal with Freddie Highmore as Charlie but the rest of it is full of deplorable performances and like I said, an evil and mean spirited overtone.

"xxxxts","2","18","33","18 July 2005"," Awful Remake, Insane Wonka
","First off let me say I am a huge fan of the original Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. In 1st grade my teacher read the class the book. What made the first movie such a masterpiece was Gene Wilder's excellent performance. His version of Willy was smart, witty, extravagant, and clever. The whole movie was filled with extraordinary things that Wonka had something clever to say about. The classic also taught a moral lesson and showed what happened to spoiled, gluttonous, and TV addicted kids. The reason why I despised the remake is this; Willy Wonka was not any of the things listed above, he was insane and rude. He was just making rude comments to the children the whole movie and saying things that made no sense. Another thing that bothered me is that every time the words 'parents' or 'family' is mentioned Johnny Depp looks like he is going to vomit! The story is not about a candy maker's relationship with his father, it is about a fantasy candy land! I did not go into the theater expecting the remake to be better then the original but I was hoping for it to be good since it had Tim Burton directing it and Johnny Depp playing the role of Willy Wonka. Most remakes take away things from the original and add different things. In the case of this movie it was exactly like the original only missing the cleverness, the excellent music and dance scenes, good acting, a wonderful main character, and originality. On a scale form 1  10 if the original is 8, the remake scores a 2. I would suggest not seeing it."

","I thought Charlie and the Chocolate Factory would be better than this. Unfortunately Tim Burton again manages to screw me out of $9.25. Granted I didn't have high hopes from this movie to begin with, but I believed it would be a more mature version of book than what was done in Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory (I happen to like this adaptation because Gene Wilder is enchanting as the eccentric factory owner). Tim Burton introduced a new form of dragging with this movie. He completely omits the main character from the film in favor of developing a back story for almost every character. The one with the longest and most intricate back story is Willy Wonka. His back story encompasses the entire second and third parts of the movie (that being the factory tour in flashbacks and the post factory tour). The only thing it accomplishes is explain Johnny Depp's portrayal of the character, which wasn't bad. Wonka is presented as a man-child with deep fears stemming from the authority of parents. This is why I prefer Gene Wilder's portrayal in the 1971 version because he acts like he's in control of the entire factory. He's an adult who sympathizes with childish surroundings. Depp acts like he's completely oblivious to his surroundings, which makes you wonder how he can get anything done. He acts almost like Howard Hughes, but without the get things done attitude and need to advance technology to the next generation, which you'd think be needed to run a factory and keep the Deep Roy's alive. Once you think the movie's over your hit in the face with the third part of the movie, which tries to tie up Wonka's back story. To make sure you know Charlie is still in the movie they run a short story on him before finishing up the Wonka plot. You wonder why this adaptation wasn't called Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory because Charlie had a much bigger role in the 1971 version. The movie ends in a nice little package but it is seriously deformed by Tim Burton's inclusion. The chocolate factory has the same Gothic styling and abrasive colors seen in every one of his movies. We know you have a signature, but Jesus try something else for a change. The musical numbers were also very weak. I read somewhere the lyrics came from the book, but the singing and the music were so awful I barely noticed them. Deep Roy needs to be shot so he cannot contaminate the rest of the world. If I wanted to see a bad musical number I would go see Rent. I only take solace in the fact this movie distracted Burton long enough for Batman Begins to correctly represent the Batman character. Thank you Tim Burton for not touching Batman in favor of adapting a newer version of the chocolate factory. You have truly placed yourself beside filmmakers like Ed Wood. At least he made bad movies with much smaller budgets."

","As one would expect, this modern take on Roald Dahl's story benefits greatly from advances in special effects; the look of both the bleak town and the factory interior are spectacular. I feel a bit of ""awe fatigue"" at this point, though, since $200 million films routinely strive for surprising visuals (often to the detriment of more down-to-earth qualities) and there's only so many things we can be truly surprised by.<br/><br/>The most glaring shortcoming of this ""Chocolate Factory"" is the bizarre, off-putting performance of Johnny Depp. He is as badly miscast as Gene Wilder was in the earlier film (Willy Wonka was both very old and a dwarf), but Wilder was very likable. Depp is just strange.<br/><br/>This one isn't a musical, so I can't really criticize it for not having songs, but I will say this: it could use some songs (besides the Oompa-Loompa musical lectures). The ""reimagined"" children are disappointing (gum-chewing and TV-watching aren't interesting enough flaws anymore so now we get hyper-competitiveness and technological precocity in their place). Veruca Salt is still a spoiled rich girl, but now she's self-aware enough to be two-faced, instead of throwing tantrums. It all makes for a long, slow tour through the factory.<br/><br/>The Oompa-Loompas are better in some ways and not in others--their look and songs are different, but they're too ""modern"" and seem out of place. They also pull the punches--we're told before he's even gone that no harm will come to Augustus Gloop, despite his clearly deserving it. It's better that we're not sure (like in the 1970 version).<br/><br/>All in all, this Tim Burton Vision of Dahl's story is a big, fat disappointment. The best parts of the story (like when Charlie believes the 5th ticket has been found, then gets the double surprise of the revelation of the forgery and getting his own ticket) are almost entirely skipped here. It's as if Burton doesn't want us to enjoy the story. If so, he got his way (at least with me)."

","I just got out of this movie and have to say some things. First of all, for those who read the book, get into the 21st century will you. No one should base their opinion of a movie off of a book. So what if he is closer to the book than the older movie. What kind of biased opinion is that. If you like the book so much go ahead and read it and quit saying the movie is good because it goes with the book. Anyway, just judging this movie off of it's pure entertainment value it sucks. The acting and wooden dialog sunk it. The character development was nil. The sound editing was terrible (I couldn't understand a word the oompa loompa's were singing). There wasn't any emotional investment in any other characters except for Charlie and Wonka. I had no feelings for any of them. It was lacking in humor. So what kind of movie was it? A bad one. Most of the critics out there are blinded by Tim Burton and his ""artistic"" viewpoint. I don't want art. I want entertainment. I feel sorry for the real lessons that could be learned about the kids in this movie. Most of it was really glossed over and their bad habits were less than side stories. The search for the golden ticket wasn't that good either. It was very rushed and each kid got 1 minute to show that they had bad habits. For you book people, I think Charlie's father is actually missing in the book but yet somehow he is alive this whole movie. The original Wonka, the original movie will be forever enshrined in history. This was just awful."

Where as in both Dahl's fine story and the 1972 film every character had some depth and warmth about them, and I truly felt pulled into a magical space, not without difficulty and pain (as in all of Dahl's work), in this 2005 production I felt as if the editor may has well have shuffled the scenes at random.

","The first thing I thought when the end credits rolled up was ""Tim Burton, you rotten, rotten man! You've been going on for weeks in the papers about how much better your film will be because it is truer to the book and about how you haven't even bothered to watch the previous film anyhow (so how would you know yours is truer to the book?) and how Roald Dahl hated the previous film because it focused too much on Wonka and not enough on Charlie. But your film goes miles further with this!"" The only real departure that the first film makes from the basic story of the book is Charlie and Grandpa Joe's misdemeanour with the Fizzy Lifting Drinks which ends up having quite serious repercussions towards the end of the story but which I think manages to deepen it in a way. Burton has completely missed the mark on Wonka. His issue is not warped childhood/estranged father, nor should this have any bearing on his eccentricity. Willy Wonka simply does not trust people. And rightly so. Many of them are out to steal his secrets. But he realises he is getting older and he needs to find someone he can trust in order to pass on his magical legacy. The fact that the first film makes more of this is a good thing and also that both Charlie and Wonka both have to get beyond their human imperfections (and the other delicious thing about this film is that we find out Wilder's Wonka is human after all, we finally see past the facade) in order to form a relationship with one another. Depp's Wonka and Highmore's Charlie never earn this relationship. He is simply the last one left and Depp greets him manically with ""Oh you're the last one left! You're the winner!"" Later he says to his parents ""He won cause he was the least rotten of them all."" It's like he never sees who Charlie is and I think this is the result of a directorial decision which makes the main action of the movie all about Depp. It is as if all the other actors are there to hold up Depp while he minces about in all his velvet coated eccentricity. That's not to say his performance doesn't have its charm and wonderful moments of comic timing. But he never seems to listen or absorb which seems odd for a character who is sitting in judgement on this group of people. Everything seems to be drawn in towards him. He is even given a trite back story which is so from the mischief and wicked glee of Dahl that I couldn't believe how Burton could kid himself that this was true to the book, either its plot or tone, or that his film was more about Charlie than Wonka. It can be argued that the first film misses Dahl's superb sense of the Macabre. But even though Tim Burton is a master of the Macabre in his own way, imposing his style onto Dahl's story doesn't quite work, even though he has a perfect right to do it, artistic freedom and all that, and it can be fun to watch. It works somewhat with the evil children, particularly in the preternatural quality of their skin and the clever camera angles used to enhance their demonic expressions. Even their characterisations worked quite well and were well updated, especially in the case of Mike Teevee. The squirrels and oompa loompas were far more ominous in the book because they were given the time. In the end he completely misses the spirit of the book. Dahl had a kind of sadistic patience with the children's demises whereas in this film we were rushed through them so there would be screen time for the overtly moral message at the end which Dahl would probably cringe at, at least one as sentimental as what is on offer at the end of this. Anyway the book HAS a moral message. If you are a nasty greedy little child you will come to a sticky end. Simple and no-nonsense! The book also suggests a possibility that there can be cases where a person will be judged on their own internal character rather than on their status in life. A theme which I think Burtons film does touch upon, I really liked the opening line which said something about although Charlie rarely had enough to eat he was the luckiest boy in the world. The opening of Wonkas factory with the warped puppets going on fire was interesting and creepy, but it was Tim Burton creepy and we've seen it all before, toys with their eyes popping out and so on...Gothic splendour and tired kookiness. Harking back to the fizzy lifting drinks episode from the first film where Charlie and his Grandpa have to burp themselves back to safety, I love that scene, even if it is not in the book and even if the writer himself may not have approved, because it captures all the possibility, the underlying danger and the absurdity of the story. Roald Dahl is all about the Macabre in the ordinariness of life. His more vile characters are shocking because they are based in reality, albeit twisted and stretched by means of his joyfully malicious imagination. He revels in belching and picking your nose and eating worms thinking they are spaghetti and gluing your fathers hat to his head. And like Wonkas factory he takes these possibilities, frees them from logic and turns them into wonderful feats of the imagination. But let me just say for the record I was rather enjoying the film until the end when Tim Burton wussed out and made the story go where no story should ever go. Where big fat Hollywood execs say it should."
"Cenerentola","5","18","34","29 June 2006"," Failed, to my disappointment
","After reading a glowing review in Entertainment Weekly for this movie I eagerly rented it and settled in for a cozy movie night. What I got was a head-scratching film that left me with a distinctly sour taste in my mouth. The original Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory is one of my personal favorites. I was well aware that this would be a far cry from that version. This version is decidedly more faithful to the book but I feel it reflects more of Tim Burton's need to be kooky than it does of capturing the sugary irresistibility of the book. The movie, simply put, is not simple enough. Granted, the book is often maniacal and bizarre but too much emphasis is placed here on the look. The actors seem, to me, to be wandering aimlessly among the sets, seeing them but not feeling them. The children fail to provide a new and interesting interpretation on the characters, instead becoming blah clones of the feisty five-some in the original. In fact, you would think their parents dragged them to the set every morning against their will. Their ""parents"" fare no better. How anyone could possibly laud these performances compared to the 1971 original is beyond me. Depp's Wonka is passable but far too creepy to be endearing. He has his moments though. The music is, sadly, another weakness of the movie. It is simply too jarring and techno-modern for this version, even if it is a contemporary remake. There are a few bright spots here and there. The visuals are gorgeous and I was delighted to see the more accurate portrayal of the boat (a viking ship instead of a strange floating surrey thing). Deep Roy (how can I get a name like that?) does an admirable job as all the Oompa-Loompas. Not one of them looks exactly alike. I wasn't too fond of the character design though. Overall, not the best of Burton. See this one for a quick trip but see the original to be truly transported."

","I don't even know where to begin with how disappointed I was with this movie. Having grown up with the incredibly talented Gene Wilder as ""Willy Wonka,"" I expected my view to be tainted, but I tried to watch this film with an open mind. Nice try. Johnny Depp, who has made some wonderful movies in his own right, cannot hold a candle to Gene Wilder in this role. Whereas Wilder played Wonka as mysterious, a bit mischievous, but good-hearted, Depp played him like he had just done a serious amount of cocaine. His dislike for the children was overplayed and I was waiting for him to beat the crap out of them at any moment. Wilder's performance was more subtle and sarcastic. Depp's June Allyson hairstyle did nothing for me either. Whereas ""Willy Wonka..."" was made years before all this computer graphics crap, it seemed more real. ""Charlie..."" seemed like a film student's graduate project. Bottom line: ""Willy Wonka..."" is for adults. ""Charlie..."" is for children with a low I.Q. Some movies just don't need to be remade; in fact most don't. Look at ""Cheaper by the Dozen"" and ""Yours, Mine, and Ours."" The people who made these movies took classic comedy and turned them into fart jokes and basic toilet humor. Doesn't anyone in Hollywood have an original idea? Or has America lost its integrity when it comes to movies? The best movies being made these days are independent films. What does that tell you?"

Though I have seriously disliked Burton's latest 'sell out' movies, I have to say that even THIS was too awful for him! I would liken it more to The Cat in the Hat or The Grinch. The character's are completely 1 dimensional wierdos (even Charlie and his family who are supposed to be the warm, familiar, human side of the story) and none of the actor's appear to have no chemistry whatsoever (even Charlie and Depp, who I thought worked well in Finding Neverland together).<br/><br/>Traditionally, you would expect the Burton version to be much darker than the original, however, in this case, the original is the darker of the 2, whereas Burton's version is more like an episode of 'My Little Pony!'

If this was what the Director was aiming for, Carey would have been far better suited to the role.<br/><br/>The Oompa Loompa tunes and lyrics are an integral part of our culture  how dare they be tampered with! Frankly I think that, other than the technological improvements in terms of production, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory adds nothing the films legacy.

"MyOpinionIsFact","3","16","30","25 July 2005"," Mid-way through I decided I didn't like it
","Tim Burton misses the mark... again. Here is a story that it seems to me would be difficult to ruin: a kid's movie about magical chocolate. The movie starts off well enough. We are introduced to Charlie's family and town and learn about the Chocolate factory. The finding of Charlie's ticket to visit the factory slowly lumbers towards its inevitable conclusion. This is my first complaint that the finding of the ticket was not serendipitous but treated as if desire can influence reality (remember kids, you can win the lottery so long as if you really, really want to win). OK. So what. It's forgivable. The story moves on and we find ourselves on a tour of the factory. For a while things are fine and then with one new plot device -- the elevator -- things go completely downhill. Now effects rather than character take over the story (I don't call them special effects because it's not often anymore that they 'wow' us... they are ordinary effects). The characters also act completely unnatural during some of these scenes (i.e., the parents and Wonka just sit back and watch barely concerned as their children do dangerous things). Anyway, the movie goes on until the end. There's no point about it except the most cliché of moral lessons ""your family is important"".<br/><br/>The kids in the theater laughed a few times (but not as much as they have the potential for). As an adult, I laughed twice. Once was at a pretty good joke, I must admit, about what's edible. The other was at something that wasn't intended to get a laugh.<br/><br/>Oh, regarding Wonka, what a strange dude! He's got problems... real problems."
"moonspinner55","3","10","17","5 January 2009"," Begins wonderfully...but the fun dissipates inside the factory, and Depp is a disappointment
","Tim Burton's version of Roald Dahl's classic children's book, previously filmed with music in 1971 as ""Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory"", opens with great promise, featuring incredible art direction that mixes German Expressionism with Grimm-like fantasy (aided by Danny Elfman's atmospheric, if familiar, score). Charlie Bucket, a child of little privilege who lives with his family in a lopsided house, longs to be one of five lucky worldwide recipients of a prized Golden Ticket, an invitation to tour the candy factory of reclusive genius Willy Wonka. Burton mounts the excitement of the treasure hunt, with the tickets hidden in Wonka candy bars, with gleeful aplomb, and the satire--though a bit heavy-handed--is both trendy and amusing. Once the action moves to Wonka's foreboding factory however, and Johnny Depp takes center stage as Wonka (a would-be misplaced child of the sixties), interest wanes. All the kids and parents are well-cast, particularly Freddie Highmore as Charlie and David Kelly as his Grandpa Joe, but the computer-generated effects turn Wonka's landscape into an impenetrable den of ugly colors and outsized objects (like moving wallpaper). Burton, who expressed nothing but contempt for the previous version, does borrow pieces from that film, improving upon some areas (such as Veruca Salt's exit, with squirrels instead of geese) but falling far short on others (when Grandpa Joe and Charlie secretly unwrap a Wonka bar at night and come up empty, there's no camaraderie between the two, and no embracing of the familial theme). The musical Oompa-Loompas are a dreadful come-down from the predecessor, with songs sung in different musical styles and Burton staging each like a music video (these sequences, too, steal from the first film, yet the Oompa's message ultimately gets lost in the silliness). Depp performs with too much grotesque caricature; sure, his Wonka is out of step with the world, but his sarcasm is too modern, and is geared to get easy laughs from the audience. Screenwriter John August is more out of touch than Wonka; using nasty put-downs to separate Charlie from the other kids is a facile and lazy way of telegraphing us that these children are bad examples, and the flashbacks to Wonka's childhood (as well as a visual history of the Oompa-Loompas) does absolutely nothing but chew up time on the clock. We first see Wonka himself in a flashback based on a story from Grandpa Joe (didn't Charlie know that his grandfather once worked for Willy Wonka?), making Wonka's official entrance several minutes later a non-event. This story is difficult to film without getting gummy or preachy, but Burton was on the right track with his opening sequences. Too bad the second-half is so misbegotten (and not even ambitious, really) that all the mystery drains away like melted chocolate. *1/2 from ****"

","Tim Burton did a great job with musical numbers in Nightmare Before Christmas, but the same isn't true in the live action Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. With the exception of the musical scenes, this film is a splendid film with imagery, characters, and a general mood characteristic of Burton's films.<br/><br/>Burton's version is a fresh retelling of the story and is a much different film than the 1971 version. (I never thought I'd say this, but I think I prefer the musical numbers in the '71 version, poor graphics and all!). It also includes new scenes at the end which are supposedly authorized by Rohd Dahl's widow. I think the story was better as it was, but the scenes do support the additional depth Burton injected into Wonka, so I do appreciate the scenes for what they do.<br/><br/>Depp was fabulous (look for at least one Edward Scissorhands reference) though at times reminded me of a modern Michael Jackson (shudder). The only miscast character, in my opinion, was Missi Pyle as Mrs. Beauregard. She does play a good witch, but I'd have preferred someone else in the role.<br/><br/>The opening sequence has some beautiful CG, though one of the final scenes has *terrible* character animation rotoscoped in a live action scene (the Violet Beauregarde character).<br/><br/>90% of the movie is true magic. The other 10% is ruined by the musical acts (and I LOVE musicals).

But what makes this movie stand out above the rest is that it takes everyone on a chocolate trip that you can't resist. In fact, by the end of the movie, my mind was so crazed with chocolate that I went to the concession stand and bought two bars of candy right away and munched it down.<br/><br/>The song of the Ommpa-loompas do not match the original, however they are very funny and very good.<br/><br/>Depp performance is very good because he's able to perfectly act as the real villain of the whole movie without you knowing it until the very end. All along the movie you think Wonka is the hero, but in the end you realize that Wonka is actually the main villain of the movie. Depp does a brilliant job in ""hiding"" this fact.<br/><br/>Now, I do like the 1970 movie better than this, but I think that is mainly due to the songs. Everything else in this movie was far better.<br/><br/>8 / 10. very good movie, one you should definitely go to see in the theaters, and IMAX if you can. If you're an adult, bring a child with you.

It does a better job of bringing the original material to the screen than the original, the only problem I have is with Johnny Depp. I don't have I problem with his acting, I think it's great, I just feel he's been directed to play the role too weirdly.

","I thought this movie was very enjoyable and well worth the admission. Unlike some, I did not read the stupid book and do not plan on doing so. Additionally, I do not identify myself as some Wonka devotee and I am sure glad that ginning up Wonka centric criticisms is not my sole reason to live. I must admit I am personally anguishing over the fact that, unlike others, I opted out of performing some pointless comparative analysis between - book – 1971 movie - and the most recent production. The end-result of wasting one's time regurgitating some of these condemnations will simply result in high-blood-pressure, chemical imbalances and soiled diapers. OK – now wait. Once this personal anguish subsides, I will be able to continue – ahhhh – it's over, I can now continue. This movie easily stands on its own merits. Similar to most Burton/Depp ventures, ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"", will definitely have a number of followers (which I am a member). To some, it will become a classic. Whenever these two dynamic personalities get together, they seem to always stir up some magical tasty potion of entertainment. I thoroughly enjoyed Mr. Depp's portrayal of a bumbling, snippy Willie Wonka. His sarcastic and (apparent) clueless delivery was superb. I doubt anyone else could have pulled off this part so brilliantly. I was also pleased to see him evolve away from the very successful 'Jack Sparrow' persona and highlight his acting diversity as Wonka. And once again, Tim Burton highlighted his behind-camera brilliance. Very much like Robert Wise of-old, anything Mr. Burton turns out, is usually worth gambling on.

","Regardless of the strong attempts to separate 2005's ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" from the 1971 ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"", the comparisons will undoubtedly be made. The classic film, with its memorable performance by Gene Wilder as Willy Wonka, still holds up just as well as it did nearly thirty five years ago, and it is likely that a large portion of the ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" audience will have seen the first version. Thankfully, the new adaptation of Roald Dahl's beloved novel, directed by Tim Burton (""Edward Scissorhands"", ""Big Fish""), distances itself quite well from the 1971 movie, and offers a new perspective to the story.<br/><br/>Many have billed the new film as an adaptation more true to Dahl's novel than the Gene Wilder version, as Roald Dahl reportedly hated the 1971 movie. Dahl's widow Felicity is onboard this time as executive producer, and she has expressed her belief that Dahl would have loved Burton's take on his novel. Screenwriter John August never even watched the 1971 film until after he had drafted the screenplay, and the result is a script that does not get tied up with trying to avoid and outdo its predecessor. I honestly hate to compare and contrast the two versions of the story, as I am sure we will all be reading plenty of that over the next few weeks, but it is practically unavoidable, so I suppose I will just run with it.<br/><br/>The major flaw with the Gene Wilder Wonka was that the film lacked much character depth, and never truly developed the relationship between Charlie and Wonka. The point at which Wonka selects Charlie as his successor arrives abruptly, and comes across more as process of elimination than a true connection between the characters. This is not an issue in Burton's version, as we see Wonka's appreciation of Charlie grow throughout the journey inside the factory, and his disgust with the naughty children is immediately evident. Furthermore, with Tim Burton's Wonka, played by Johnny Depp (""Fear and Loathing In Las Vegas"", ""Finding Neverland""), we see the humanity of the eccentric chocolate maker. Burton has always made movies involving turmoil between a father and son, so I suppose it should not be a surprise that he has brought this new element to the story of Willy Wonka. Through Wonka's constant nightmarish flashbacks, we learn the origins of his love for candy, involving his strict candy-hating dentist father, played by Christopher Lee (""Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith"", ""The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers""). Wonka's emotions are more apparent as well, as he expresses a genuine child-like joy at times when proudly displaying his factory, and becomes furious when Mike Teavee (Jordon Fry) insults candy. He displays an innocent inability to deal with people, and a complete lack of courtesy.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp has always displayed himself as a very versatile actor. As far as I'm concerned, his bizarre depiction of Hunter S. Thompson in ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas"" is one of the best performances of the 1990's, and his recent portrayal of author J.M. Barrie in ""Finding Neverland"" may have been the best performance of 2004. In ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"", he once again disappears into character, and his depiction of Willy Wonka borders on downright disturbing, while also being completely hilarious. The Michael Jackson comparisons everyone seems to be making are, quite frankly, dead on. His fellow ""Finding Neverland"" star Freddie Highmore is outstanding as Charlie Bucket, and further proves that he may be the most promising child actor in Hollywood today. The other children do a great job as well, as do the actors playing Charlie's family members. The grandparents provide a substantial amount of humor. And then, there is Deep Roy. Roy plays every Oompa Loompa in the film, wonderfully showing off endless personalities and providing a lot of humor.<br/><br/>While Roy's performance is outstanding, the Oompa Loompas were a bit of an issue for me. Visually, the depiction was excellent, and quite true to the novel, but the musical numbers left something to be desired. For the most part they were hilarious and fun, but also sometimes hard to understand, and the pop music was an unnecessary addition in my opinion. The 1971 Oompa Loompas and their songs, while not as true to the book lyrically, had a much more timeless feel to them. That is the biggest issue for me with the 2005 film; I'm just not sure it will hold up over time in the same way that the Gene Wilder version did. It is a wonderful film, but a classic? I'm just not so sure of that, and only time will tell.<br/><br/>""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" is pure Tim Burton, with each frame bursting with color and imagination, and the pacing is nearly flawless. Overall it is a very warm film, and Burton's direction keeps the movie extremely bizarre without becoming completely surreal (not that I would have minded that at all). The orchestral score by Danny Elfman is perfect, and sets the mood of the film immediately while accompanying Burton's sweeping camera movements in the opening sequence. Tim Burton fans will recognize quite a few familiar faces, and may notice a number of subtle references to past films. I really cannot choose between the two adaptations, but they compliment each other very well, and ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" is an outstanding effort. I would definitely recommend it.<br/><br/>3.5 stars (out of 4)"

","I always describe myself as a chocoholic man. And my favorite quotes in life is ""the only thing better than a good friend is a good friend with a chocolate""<br/><br/>So when I heard about the recreation of the movie ""Willy Wonka & the chocolate factory"" with the name ""Charlie and the chocolate factory"" I was really excited and could hardly wait till the moment I watch the movie, specially that Johnny Depp is starring in it<br/><br/>but after I watched the movie, I was really frustrated, the movie was just a demonstration of visual effects capabilities nothing more...<br/><br/>I remember watching Gene Wilder ""Willy Wonka"" in the old movie, I really liked the character, he was so simple in every thing, and you can feel that he is really a chocolate lover. But in this Movie, Johny Depp is great actor, no question about that but the Role itself is what I need to talk about, I found myself helpless but hating Willy Wonka!! a very complex character who is only concerned with his own life disregarding the chocolate manufacturing, his workers and every thing else, for example when Charlies' Grandfather introduced himself to him all what concerned Wonka was ""Are you one of those who tried to steal my secrets?!!!"".<br/><br/>Wonka was as bad as the winners of the 5 golden tickets, I didn't even feel that he loves chocolate. It was just a matter of His father bans him from all candies, so he just wanted to eat chocolate behind his father's back, that is all. In the old Movie I felt that there was a strong relationship between Wonka and chocolate, something called ""Love""<br/><br/>the second point was Charlie Bucket himself, Peter Ostrum, the kid who played Charlie's Role was very far from being a poor kid. He couldn't show why he needed the golden ticket that bad.<br/><br/>Also the Oompa Loompa's, those small characters who really cooperated very good with Wonka to insure the idea of enjoying being bad<br/><br/>But to be fair, I must state that the visual effects were really great specially the chocolate River, the elevator, the Squirrels.<br/><br/>Also the Sound track was cool. it really helped me a lot in watching the movie.<br/><br/>Big Sorry for Tim Burton, couldn't help it but I don't like your Movie."

","Roald Dahl's delightful book of the same title gets a magical production by that wizard of wizards, Tim Burton. If ever was a man who was born to undertake the adaptation of this beloved book into a film it was Mr. Burton, a man who understands how to entertain an audience with a good story and great cinematic flair.<br/><br/>Mr. Burton is lucky, as this film marks the fourth collaboration between him and its star, Johnny Depp. Both director and star are well attuned into what each expects from the other. The film is a triumph of creativity with a film that will satisfy children of all ages as well as grown ups. The screen play by John August serves the book and the film well.<br/><br/>Mr. Burton has given the film a glossy look that is absolutely impossible to be distracted at any given moment. In fact, the time flew by without realizing the movie was over, leaving us craving for more.<br/><br/>Willie Wonka, the genial chocolate maker, decides to invite five children for a tour of his famous chocolate factory. From the five that win the privilege, Charlie Bucket, the poor child with a rich family life, in spite of their poverty, is the only one we realize is going to be the winner because the other four display the worst qualities that will surely clash with their host. Charlie, the humble child shows Willie that having a loving family is a treasure that the chocolate maker hasn't got.<br/><br/>To say that Johnny Depp is magnificent, is not saying anything at all. As Willie, Mr. Depp has a brilliant field day hosting the group, and us, through his world and his realm. Mr. Depp is an absolute delight to watch; he seems to do everything so naturally that he becomes the real Willie Wonka.<br/><br/>As Charlie, Freddie Highmore, who had already appeared with Mr. Depp in ""Neverland"", proves again he is a young actor that is easy to like because he seems to be a natural. As his grandfather, David Kelly, is also wonderful. Freddie's parents, Noah Taylor and Helena Bonham Carter are good, and the supporting cast do an excellent job under the direction of Mr. Burton. Deep Roy, as Oompa Loompa deserves special mention as he is seen hundreds of times! Philipe Russelot, the cinematographer does wonders with his camera. The musical score is brilliant. The people behind the production technical part must be congratulated for giving the director their best into making this film, the joy it is.<br/><br/>Let the viewer beware he is in for a magical ride thanks to Mr. Burton."

","Sorry Johnny but that was awful....Boring, shallow and Depp's Wonka was very, very weird to coin a phrase.<br/><br/>From the burning dolls at the start of the tour right through to the strange inability to say 'parents' this film has lost all the charm, wit and guile of Dahl's book.<br/><br/>The Oompa Loompa's did not work at all, the songs were dreadful and as others have said very hard to understand lyrically. The boat ride was poor and could have been done much better - even the special effects over 30 years ago did a better job. Should have cut out the Wonka family moments and spent more time developing the characters in my opinion. I know the '71 Wilder Willy Wonka was not true to the book, however, at least he had 'character' unlike Depp's two dimensional portrayal.<br/><br/>Please save your dosh, buy the book and the '71 version instead."

"ReelCheese","6","8","14","18 July 2006"," Should Have Been Better
","The wonderfully whimsical Tim Burton was the perfect choice to bring a contemporary twist to the familiar tale of Willy Wonka. Unfortunately, it never really works as well as it should. Perhaps it's because we already know the story, or because Burton just doesn't translate as well when he's trying to be cute rather than weird. In particular, the musical numbers from the Oompa-Loompas, the strange little people who work in the chocolate factory, seem so out of place. Still, there is a lot that clicks, from the colorful scenery and characters to the apt performances from the child actors and Johnny Depp, who was well cast as the eccentric candy man. Children are bound to love it, but those expecting vintage Burton or a tongue-in-cheek nod to the original 1971 version will be disappointed."
"Bunuel1976","5","8","14","23 February 2006"," Charlie And The Chocolate Factory **1/2
","As if the mere fact that even today's major Hollywood film-makers - Tim Burton, The Coen Brothers, Steven Spielberg, Oliver Stone - have resorted to remaking earlier successes was not alarming enough, here we also have a remake which, despite being helmed by a vastly more talented director than the original's anonymous Mel Stuart, proves to be much less appetizing (pun intended). The thing is that, while the remake has all the visual flourishes and outrageous production design synonymous with its idiosyncratic director, it is fatally compromised by the distinctly unsympathetic characterization given by Johnny Depp (ironically, my favorite actor working in films today) in the all-important role of the reclusive Willy Wonka. While I haven't read the Roald Dahl book myself, so I can't really say with any measure of accuracy which of the two characterizations - Gene Wilder's in the 1971 original or Depp's in the remake - is the closer to Dahl's conception of Wonka, it goes without saying that Wilder's is the winner here. All in all, in fact, although I didn't enjoy that film on second viewing as much as I did the first, I prefer Wilder's version in practically every department. Also, while I did get used to the bizarrely ""modern"" musical numbers as the film progressed, I don't think they were really suited to the material. The appearance of Christopher Lee as Depp¡¦s dentist father was a welcome addition, though, and in a way his scenes helped make some of Wonka's eccentricities more palatable. In conclusion, while Burton's remake of WILLY WONKA AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY wasn't as disastrous as his 2001 version of PLANET OF THE APES, which was decidedly his nadir, here's hoping that he gets back to concocting his own original visions before long."

Many of the scenes were cut off looking as if it were filmed in the same undersized sound stage for each scene.And as for a good story line. could you maybe have given us something to care about before offing each child.

I do not recommend bringing a young child to the movie, as it is frightening to many. But 6 up I have found really enjoy the film and adults love it! There are a lot of references to other (older) movies, plays, etc. I was one of the few teenagers that actually understood almost all of the humor in it! Johnny Depp is magnificent in his role, playing it perfectly! He plays the role of a man with the mind of a boy, just like Wonka should be played. I loved the original, but unfortunately for those Gene Wilder fans out there, I prefer the new movie. Just because you have heard it is twisted (which is true and which makes it even funnier) and you shouldn't bring your kids, it is still a movie just the parents can go see one night.

"chuckc","8","8","14","18 July 2005"," Burton and His Cast Have Done Dahl Right
","As much as I like ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory,"" this was a film crying out to be remade. It was a minor classic thanks to the performances of not only Gene Wilder (still the definitive Wonka, I think), but also the rest of the cast (especially Peter Ostrom)--as well as its often witty script. But it was dragged down by depressing production design (which resembled a mini-golf course built in an old waterfront warehouse), those Bricuisse-Newley songs (stop the movie I want to get off), and the hideous Oompa-Loompas (purple-faced, orange-haired freaks in genie shoes).<br/><br/>Burton's remake gives Dahl's classic story the production values it deserves--and ratchets up the creepiness. Johnny Depp's Wonka is a ten-year-old, and a rather anti-social one at that, in a adult's body--a freak with Carol Channing's hair and smile, Jack Skellington's physique, and Oscar Wilde's wardrobe. Depp does an excellent job, but he doesn't make the character quite likable enough (Wilder's Wonka was mercurial yet affable); still, he fits Burton's vision of Wonka's world. (I've often thought that Depp would be the only actor other than Wilder who could play this role.)<br/><br/>Danny Elfman does excellent work on the score. The various Oompa-Loompa songs (Dahl's words set to different musical styles, such as 1980s ""hair metal"") are great numbers that ""doop-a-dee-doop-a-dee"" beat the original movie's rather sugary tunes.<br/><br/>Best movie of the summer so far."
"RaspberryWaffles","2","7","12","24 April 2008"," Disgraceful
","I saw this movie when it came out and I was disgusted. I usually like to watch a movie a second and third time to get a better perspective and I usually end up with better outlook that second or third time. Not this movie, every time I watched it I felt more offended and disgusted than the last. This takes all the magic and the charm out of Willy Wonka that you almost feel like puking. How could they have gone from the original to this, ooh wait, I forgot its easy. The rap/hip hop was the first mistake. Why take the great songs and turn them into the lowest form of ""music"" there is in the world. It would have sounded better if a bunch of cats were dying to the beat of the music. Secondly, the actors, besides Johnny Depp, were all flat. They were 2-dimensional and boring. Nothing shone from anyone besides Depp, who wasn't too great either if I may add. Yet it wasn't Depp's fault and I know this, the rest of the cast made him look like a mediocre actor, which he is definitely not. This movie would have done much better if it was cast into a fire before release, that way nobody who saw the original would have to suffer through this pile of feces. Final summary- This movie only appeals to small children and ignorant people who have not seen the original."
"JCR-4","6","7","12","12 January 2007"," Disappointing
","I know this film follows closer to the book than the original, but that does not automatically ensure it's a better film. I'm afraid I preferred the original - Johnny Depp was just too weird for my taste, and if that was how Wonka was supposed to be, then I can understand why Gene's Wilder's interpretation was of a warmer Wonka. But also this new version bored me. We went from scene to scene without any real continuity - I didn't get to dislike the other kids as much as I should have done - it all seemed very shallow. There wasn't enough depth in the characters of the other children and their parents. I believe the original film took license to make a film that was actually better than the book, rather than attempting to stick to it. Also in this film the Chocolate factory itself disappointed me - I actually found it a depressing place. To save the film was the acting of Charlie and the family who were all great, as was Christopher Lee as Wonka's father."

","Like many others, I grew up with Willy Wonka and The Chocolate Factory, and loved it dearly, and try as hard as you like but comparisons were always going to be inevitable. Meeting high expectations were always going to be a tall order, and in my opinion, this film has failed to meet them.<br/><br/>Little needs to be explained about this film, as the story is as familiar now to everyone as the 3 bears. Johnny Depp as Willy Wonka takes us on a very dark and even disturbing tour of this factory, with the 5 kids accompanied by a parent/grandparent in their tale.<br/><br/>In some ways this is a horror tale where the film is made for us to wish to see the kids get what they deserve, but this takes away from the light heartedness of the tale. The kids to me are more freakish than the original and don't seem to be given sufficient time, and Tim Burton's take seems to see his imprint want to overshadow that of Roald Dahl's.<br/><br/>I was a little disappointed by this movie, although i don't deny the setting was wonderful, and the interpretation original, but I can't see myself wanting to ever watch it again.... and in any case why didn't they keep that wonderfully frightening boat ride as in the first movie?"

","I have seen this movie, and I must say that this movie is FAR better that Gene Wilder's film. He was just right for 1971, but he seemed relatively boring. My sister, Colette, says ""nothing beats the Original"". I beg to differ with her. She was born in 1964, and I was born in 1980. Of course she would like the original. While it is true that I was born closer to Gene Wilder's film, I love Johnny Depp's film much better. I cannot wait until it comes out on DVD, and I am talking about its release already. If someone asked my opinion about whose film was better, I would say Johnny Depp. He is by far better than Wilder. I read a comment on a website from Wilder about Johnny Depp's film, and he was angry, and disappointed. He said:"" Why would anyone remake Willy Wonka? It's all about money"". I'm so sorry, but Gene Wilder has to lighten up. Johnny Depp's performance of Willy Wonka is extremely well done, and he and ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"", gets 10 stars, and two thumbs up from me. The new film far surpasses that than Wilder's."

","The original movie was good. If you have seen it, picture that with even more detail and background. That is close to what this film is. Tim Burton did a very good job with this and took us around the Factory while providing more insight than the first movie did. There is no better and worse here because they are both very good. This was a well-done movie. I enjoyed it and was glad that I saw an advanced screening to it. It was warm, charming, and fun. Depp did a superb, outstanding job as Willy Wonka. I know that many doubted that he would be able to do the job, but think about how long of a way he's come. He is a very good actor, and he proved so more here. I totally forgot that it was Depp playing the character. All I saw was Willy Wonka. He was just that convincing. If you want to see this movie but are worried about how Depp will do, relax now and go watch it because you will most likely not be disappointed. The movie is good and touching at some points, giving some details to Wonka's past, which is not emphasized in the original version. This lets you see who Willy Wonka actually is and why he is the way he is. There is a lot of symbolism, which is one of the movie's strong points. I like how there is a reason for everything and everyone. And in conclusion, the trip to the Chocolate Factory was a great and interesting one. The children will enjoy it especially with the many funny parts and everyone else will like it because it's entertaining. The worse thing I can mention about this is the way the songs were done by the Oompa Loompas. But they were still all right. They were passable. The great and artistic Burton did an overall good job with this film =)<br/><br/>7.5/10 Stars"

"MinionWench","9","10","19","30 July 2005"," Let's bring in the view of an Englander NOT obsessed with Michael Jackson....
","Reading through some other reviews here I felt a dire need to write one of my own.<br/><br/>I went into an afternoon showing of this film with a group of friends whose ages ranged from 16 to 10, we were in a cinema packed to bursting with small children (think 5 or 6 years old) who had dragged along their parents. And the whole way through we were all laughing.<br/><br/>This wasn't a children's film that the parents had to suffer through, and it wasn't so childish that teenagers wanted to vomit. It was the classic tale we all know and love, only slightly modernised to reflect todays children.<br/><br/>I'll tackle the children first, while some remained completely faithful to their book roots (August Gloop, particularly) it was good to see that some had changed slightly to reflect how children are today (such as Mike Teevee who is obsessed with TV and violence, and Violet whose mother is constantly encouraging her to be competitive and a 'winner') These kinds of children are commonplace these days, we've all met at least one, and it helps the viewer to slide into the film with ease.<br/><br/>Johnny Depps' acting was inspired. It angers me to see so many people instantly seeing his performance as based on Michael Jackson when it quite plainly isn't. Perhaps the American medias obsession with Jackson in recent months is to blame for this. But what I saw when i first saw Depps' Wonka was a recluse, scared and uncertain of how to be around people. He needs prompt cards to introduce himself.<br/><br/>His detachment from the world makes him seem weird, quirky even, but it's good because the space he keeps between himself and others is the exact opposite of what Charlie teaches us, that we need our families, we need others in our lives, which is an important lesson for todays children who have become increasingly 'memememe'.<br/><br/>Burton has done another stunning job, visually. The colours of the chocolate factory are stunning, and you can feel that you've entered a world of imagination and left the, literally, grey outside world far behind.<br/><br/>As always Elfmans music is a joy, and reflects the quirkiness of Burtons' vision. The 'Welcome' song is hysterical and instantly you find that while you may know the story, you have no idea as to what's about to hit you. The Oompa-Loompas songs are, unfortunately, very hard to hear over the roar of the music which is a damn shame, but the dance moves alone will have you in hysterics.<br/><br/>It was refreshing to find things added into this film that we didn't see in Wilders' version or in the book. I particularly loved seeing how Wonka found the Oompa-Loompas.<br/><br/>While i was a little surprised to be shown flashbacks of Wonkas childhood throughout, i quickly accepted it, and found it interesting as it lead to another important message that todays' children should always remember, that sometimes parents stop you from doing things because they actually love you, not because they hate you, and that they just want what's best for you.<br/><br/>This film was a joy to sit through, i hung on every word, silently urging the characters on so i could see what was going to happen next, hear what was going to be said. I had to know, even though i already knew the ending.<br/><br/>This is the kind of film children should be watching today. This is what a summer movie should be. This is what happens when Burton/Depp/Elfman deliver.<br/><br/>Roll on Corpse Bride..."

","To begin with, I realize that this version is closer to the novel, I also realize that the filmwork and casting was overall pretty good, but I still hated it, and here's why: This is not a happy movie, this is not ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"", and Johnny Depp is not Gene Wilder, and you realize these points from the beginning. One thing that really, really bothered me about this picture were the oompa loompas. Now I understand that Burton made it a point to avoid the staple, cookie cutter oompa loopma design, but these newer ones lack whimsy, and resemble shrunken ethnic men. None of the original music is here, which goes without saying because the obvious point of the movie is to prove that Burton can remake a movie without resorting to the old stuff from the original. However, the newer stuff looks like crap in contrast to the stuff that we were introduced to thirty years ago. I found this movie extremely depressing overall, and everything that I really liked in the original is really different in this version.<br/><br/>On the other hand, I have thought for years that Johnny Depp hasn't made a good movie since ""Edward Scissorhands"", and although I really disliked this flick, his performance was pretty good. The likability factor for this movie really depends solely on your loyalty and love for the original."

","Clearly the studio shills/plants are out in force for this dud. Word of mouth should be just dreadful.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp as Willy Wonka is downright creepy. He vacillates from kid-hating to having an almost pedophiliac attraction to them. And that's when the sensation jells. His outrageous wardrobe, his sallow, flawless skin, his pageboy haircut make him look eerily like the eerie Michael Jackson. That image and thought certainly yanked me out of the moment every time he appeared (which didn't begin until the film was one-third over).<br/><br/>The film adds another subchapter to the book's ending, but otherwise follows the original storyline, with poorer-than-dirt Charlie finally finding one of five golden invitations to visit the Wonka chocolate factory.<br/><br/>Settings inside the plant reviews, this movie is just awful.<br/><br/>Unlike ""Willy Wonka,"" Burton's film isn't a musical. But it has several musical production numbers in it, all featuring the omnipresent Oompa-Loompas.

","I went to see Tim Burton's ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" when it was showing at Odyssey cinemas with my mum on my 10th birthday, but was completely unimpressed with it, ever since I first got into the far superior 1971 film ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"" which is still one of my favourite films up to date.<br/><br/>First of all, the film stars Johnny Depp, completely miscast as Willy Wonka because you can't really compare him to Gene Wilder.<br/><br/>Secondly, Tim Burton tried to make it more faithful to the original novel, but, also, some backstory where we see Willy Wonka's childhood and meet his father Wilbur Wonka, played by Christopher Lee, who works as a dentist.<br/><br/>Lastly, Danny Elfman's music score makes it a very dark adaptation of Roald Dahl's novel, if he had lived to see it.<br/><br/>If you are a big fan of ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" when you've read the book, please just stick with the original colourful 1971 ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"" Film starring Gene Wilder, if you grew up watching it. I've watched it so many times and still enjoy it!"

","Dreary to look at and utterly devoid of the charm and warmth that made the 1971 film an enduring classic. Because of the iconic original we know what is coming in the storyline, but the delivery is so lacklustre that it ends up as unsatisfying. <br/><br/>The musical numbers are more annoying than entertaining, and none are memorable in the slightest. It would have served this film to drop the musicality altogether rather than serve up this slop. <br/><br/>Why are all the oompa loompa's identical clones of one creepy, ugly man?<br/><br/>Johnny Depp ... hmm. He looks like a dark-haired Sharon Stone and totally lacks the humour and warmth that Gene Wilder brought to the role. He is trying too hard to be 'kooky' and it is just annoying. The whole back-story of Wonka's dentist father was silly and unnecessary. <br/><br/>You can't really fault any of the actors, who do the best they can under bad direction. Such a shame.<br/><br/>Dreary, hollow and unsatisfying. See the 1971 film it is far superior!"
"nilanna999","1","6","10","13 December 2011"," Could have been good but failed
","When I was a kid, Roald Dahl was one of my heroes. His books really understand some of the ways kids think. They're downright nasty at times but they ring true to children and adults. So therefore, I would expect any movies based on his books to capture that essence and to look the way we imagined the story or to show a new way of imagining it that is just as good as our version.<br/><br/>In 1971, Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory was a perfect movie version of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. It didn't follow the book all the time but it captured the heart of the story and, at times, told the story even better, especially in the character of Charlie. Other directors have made good films out of Dahl books as well, even when they deviated from the material. Since Burton wanted to make an adaptation that was closer to the book, I was excited to see what he came up with because it really is a good book.<br/><br/>Let me make something perfectly clear. This movie could have been fantastic under Burton's direction. Charlie and the Chocolate Factory has some intense and almost disturbing ideas and had Burton intended to make this a horror film he would have succeeded with a lot of the elements in the movie staying the same. The soundtrack sounds like something in a horror film. Some of the scenes are scary enough that a bit of tweaking could make it fit the horror genre (especially the blueberry scene, little tip, that wasn't supposed to be scary, it was supposed to be WEIRD). And had they made this a horror film, tweaking Depp's performance would have worked to its advantage seeing as he's already creepy enough. Yes, this movie could have worked. But like with The Garbage Pail Kids Movie, they decided to take this dark and disturbing direction and market it to children and, even more insulting, Dahl fans.<br/><br/>Taking lines directly out of the book does not make this movie more faithful to the book. If that had been Burton's intention, he would have made the movie a little brighter and a lot more whimsical. Neither Depp nor Wilder really capture the Wonka from the book (who acts a bit like the 11th Doctor from Doctor Who, now I think of it) but deviation from the character isn't necessarily an issue. Wilder drew on the mad scientist elements from the book and made the role a real joy to watch. But Wonka from the book was odd, yes, but not awkward like Depp's portrayal. I don't know what drugs he was on but his performance was awful. Depp could have been a good Wonka and that makeup would have worked, again, had they wanted to turn this into a horror film. Coming back to the lines taken from the book, had Depp performed the character just like the one in the book, the lines would have worked. But they simply didn't work for his portrayal. Nothing worked at all.<br/><br/>One of the few things I thought the film did a little better was making the kids more bratty. They should have toned down Mike Teavee, however, who was annoying but not necessarily a complete jerk. Violet's upgrade worked well because it played on a stereotype we've all seen, the kid who has to win everything. If there's one error in Dahl's writing, it's that his earlier protagonist children didn't have much personality, an error he fixed with later books, and that's very obvious with Charlie but Charlie was a nice kid with the spark of imagination and he was a bit of an idealist. Peter Ostrum's portrayal took that and improved on it. Freddie Highmore, who is a fine actor but nonetheless was subject to the directing, took that character and did NOTHING with it. In fact, he gave the character even less personality. The exact same can be said for Veruca, who was a brat in the book, even more bratty in the original movie, and had no personality in this movie.<br/><br/>Long story short, this was very close to being a good film. The tone should have been shifted to horror and it would have worked on every level with a bit of fixing here and there. It was already dark and creepy and removing the stupid, horrible jokes would have made it a lot more scary and thus it would have been an interesting take on the book. As it stands, it simply does not work for anyone. It's too scary for children and too stupid for adults. Half the characters and cardboard cutouts or stereotypes and the other half are over-acted or over done and the one character that actually worked, Violet, still was bogged down by everything else that went wrong. Read the book, watch the 1971 film, but don't waste your time on this film. It's not worth it."

","What a pathetic attempt at re-creating a movie that had already been created. Really. Yes, more modern technology sure, but the lack of proper character development and story progression really got me irritated. And the random pointless back story and alternate ending? Really? So it starts out very high tech. Then it shoes Charley. He looks quite fortunate, not poor or anything. Their house exaggerates the concept of a 'poor house'. Second, the other characters sucked. Really bad. The snobby rich 'I want it' girl? She didn't have any of the attitude. Just some girl who smiled and that was it. And yes, I'm comparing this to the original, 10 times better movie.<br/><br/>The girl with chewing gum? The mom's very creepy, and it was unneeded. The 'fat' kid was okay, actually. The video game kid was okay as well.<br/><br/>Willy Wonka? Let's just say he looked NOTHING like the original. NOTHING. He looked more like some creepy, non-social guy, who was... we'll just end it there.<br/><br/>The story goes way too fast. They get into the factory in the most creepy way. Willy Wonka acts very creepy, and as the story goes along you see the failed attempts to be funny. I did not laugh once.<br/><br/>Then they dare alter the ending and made it ten times more creepy.<br/><br/>Seriously this movie isn't worth it. And I have hard times rating movies this low, but this movie doesn't deserve the praise when the other one did it just fine."
"scifilucy","1","6","10","23 August 2009"," Tragic
","well, i can't actually comment on the whole of this film, as i turned over after an hour or so. thats how bad it is.<br/><br/>The original film, although not true to the book was wonderful. Gene Wilder's Wonka was inspired. Eccentric, mysterious and somewhat scary, although not in a bad way. Depp is none of these things, oh sorry, if you count a rather disturbing Jackson-like portrayal of Wonka, then at least it hits the 'scary' note!<br/><br/>So many things in this film disappoint that its difficult to know where to start. The flashbacks to Wonka's childhood are just ridiculous and totally un-necessary. The Oompa Loompas (or should I say Oompa Loompa) are just plain boring, no green hair or orange faces or brilliant songs this time. I know that in the Dahl book the Oompas were actually meant to be pigmys, and were changed to the 1971 characters for fear of interpretation of racism, but they actually added another dimension to the film which was a touch of genius.<br/><br/>its kind of like the sadness i encountered when the film version of The Hitchhikers Guide to The Galaxy was made. both were totally unrequired, insults to the original. Typical for Burton to think that modern special effects would improve the story. they don't. what good films need is charisma, and you can't CG that i'm afraid.<br/><br/>Read the book, or watch the original. I just feel sorry for those who only know the story through this terrible remake which is a complete travesty IMHO."

","Another remake that should have never happened. Depp is horribly boring in this part and even the lavish sets can't save this disaster.<br/><br/>I was hoping the ship would sink in the chocolate sea with the entire cast lost. The music is bad, the acting worse, and the chocolate probably stinks too.<br/><br/>Christopher Lee probably regrets having his name in the credits. If he doesn't, he should.<br/><br/>The original with Gene Wilder wasn't one of my favorites, but it far outshines this total waste of film.<br/><br/>I have enjoyed most of Tim Burton's work in the past (hated Scissorhands though), but this has to be his weakest effort. I actually give it a rating of 1 because that's as low as it can go."

","This latest adaptation of the children's classic CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY may suffer in the shadow of the 1971 original film starring Gene Wilder, but the new version of CHARLIE is full of its own brand of chocolaty goodness. Fans of the Roald Dahl novel will be pleased to learn that the larger portions of the film follow the book more closely than the Gene Wilder version, with occasional modern-day updates (such as TV addict Mike Teevee's portrayal as a video-game junkie).<br/><br/>The child-cast play their bratty characters to the hilt, coupled with wonderful reactions from their equally loathsome parents, while Charlie and his poor-but-loving family are unfailingly heartwarming and honest. Johnny Depp plays a slightly squicky, hands-offish Wonka (think germ phobia, but for children) that is miles away from Wilder's devilish candy-maker. While Depp's Wonka may be off-putting in his first few scenes, by the end of the film he is not only enjoyable, but almost lovable. Add to this scene-stealing performances by Deep Roy (who plays a whole factory of Oompa-Loompas voiced by composer Danny Elfman) and Christopher Lee, and you have a wickedly wonderful film--and this from someone who went into the theatre ready to defend to the death the 1971 version! <br/><br/>If you loved the Gene Wilder original, find a place in your heart for the very different charms of CHARLIE."
"AMCook2008","Null","6","10","11 August 2005"," I heard the movie was bad, but it's just the opposite.
","I went to see Willy Wonka with my cousin about a week ago. Since I saw it, I couldn't stop talking about it. People had told me that movie was going to be a bad remake but it was not at all. The best part was that they gave background on Willy Wonka. They should have done that on the first one too. Also, the ending is completely different than the first one but much better. If I had to rate the movie on a scale of 10, 10 being the highest, I would give it a 9, and I don't even like Johnny Depp. My favorite movie is also by Tim Burton. He has surpassed any expectations I had for the movie. There were many memorable scenes from the movie and I will be talking about it for a while. I cannot wait until it comes out on DVD so I can watch it with my friends. However, there were a few things in the movie that I didn't like, but there will always be parts in a movie that people don't like. The oompa loompas were a bit different and some of the children's' parents were a little different from the first one. It's not different in a bad way. I wouldn't want it to be exactly like the first one though, because that would be like watching the same movie twice. Tim Burton did a good job of keeping the idea of the first one and making it completely his own."
"cosmic_quest","7","6","10","4 August 2005"," Great Depiction of a Favourite Book!
","As a fan of the original 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory' film, I wondered if I could enjoy this remake (especially when I saw the Oompa Loompas sans yellow faces and green hair!). And the childish trailers for the films hardly did it any favours in trying to entice audiences over eight. However, from the moment the film began, I knew that I was onto a winner.<br/><br/>Tim Burton and John August have managed to create a film that brings in the best of the Roald Dahl book without rehashing the novel word-by-word. They are also not afraid to show that the book is not some sickly-sweet fairytale but a dark story of poverty, bratty children and adults who can be rather cruel and malicious when it suits them. It also retains the point that children are often what their parents raise them to be, whether they want to or not (ie, Veruca's parents spoil her so she grows to be a brat, Mike's parents are too soft on him so he rules the roost while Wonka's father deprived him harshly of goodies without explaining he was just trying to do what's best for his son so young Willy rebelled). Perhaps, with that in mind, this might not be a suitable film for very young or sensitive children who are used to a warmer world being depicted on-screen.<br/><br/>While Johnny Depp couldn't quite capture the same maliciousness of Willy Wonka in a way that Gene Wilder was able to capture, his Michael Jackson-esquire performance was still rather creepy and disturbing. Depp also managed to depict a rapport between his character and young Charlie, played wonderfully by Freddie Highmore. There seemed to be a real brotherly relationship between the two (and it was interesting that the role of the big brother was taken by Charlie while the emotionally immature Wonka was cast as the little brother who needed to be taught the value of family over material possessions) that was lacking in the original film where Wonka didn't really connect with Charlie until the final few minutes of the film.<br/><br/>The children in the film are all excellent, especially when one considers most of them are newcomers aged no older than twelve or so. Freddie Highmore was successful in bringing the mix of vulnerability and inner strength to Charlie making the audience truly empathise with the character and cheer him on. However, overall, the prize has to go to Julia Winter, who was perfect as the atrociously spoilt Veruca Salt, and Jordan Fry, who depicted a hideously annoying Mike Teevee.<br/><br/>However, the film was not without its bad points. For one, the songs sang by the Oompa Loompas was inferior compared to the those in the original. Too much was done to 'jazz' them up and they ended up lacking the rhythm of the original songs that left the audience wanting to join in.<br/><br/>But it's the Americanisms of the film that causes it to drop a few points in my mind. Yes, this was a film made by Hollywood but American children will not go into meltdown if the British references of the book were retained. Charlie is an English child yet this film has him referring to 'dollars' (very odd considering he is living in England) and 'vacations' instead of 'holidays'. And is there really a need to have the British characters to refer to the chocolate as 'candy'? It would have been a nicer touch if the American characters used American terms and the British characters used British terms. Instead, the use of Americanisms just left me feeling Hollywood was dumbing down in much the same way 'Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone' was dumbed down in both novel and film version in deference to the American audience. Maybe Hollywood needs to remember that in a country where school pupils as young as eight are made to memorise the name of fifty states and capitals, American children are far more intelligent than they are obviously given credit for by film producers and book publishers.<br/><br/>Having said that, 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory' is an excellent film that I would recommend to everyone from families to more mature cinema-goers. It's story appeals to all age groups without resorting to gooey, nauseating scenes and there is something for fans of the book and original film as well as those who might never have heard of Charlie and Wonka before."

","8.3/10 When i saw the trailer for this film i thought it would be a terrible copy designed to get money with a popular name. I was wrong. Tim Burton does an amazing job with Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. Lets start with the acting. At first i thought Depp was a bad choice but he gives us a superb and different portrayal of Willy Wonka. I hate his haircut though. Freddie Highmore as Charlie was also excellent and he fit his role well. David Kelly as Grandpa Joe was pretty good but not excellent. Helena Carter and Noah Taylor also did a good job. Annasophia Robb, Julia Winter, Jordan Fry and Phillip Wiegratz all fit their roles perfectly as the bratty children and were very convincing. John August's screenplay was almost perfect. I liked the part about Wonka's childhood with Christopher Lee. Some of Wonka's lines were bad but overall the screenplay was funny and refreshing. My biggest problem with this movie was Danny Elfman's terrible oompa loompa songs. They are nothing like the catchy tunes from the original movie. Usually i like Elfman though. The cinematography of Rousselot shows the wondrous factory and Charlies poor family's house. Tim Burton has made an excellent movie out of otherwise used material. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie even though many reviews criticized it."
"noahgree","1","19","42","14 July 2005"," why oh why?
","Rarely have I been as depressed coming out of a movie theater as I was last night after seeing Charlie. I have been a Roald Dahl fan my whole life, and Charlie has always been one of my favorite books. That being said, Tim Burton and Johnny Depp have officially been added to my hit list for completely butchering one of the greatest stories ever written.<br/><br/>While Charlie is played exactly by Freddie Highland, Burton rushes through his pre-Golden Ticket story, and as the movie goes on, he seems to forget his presence as a character. In the book, Charlie walks by the factory everyday, longing to get inside and see what's in store. In this movie....nothing. Charlie's magnanimous notion to sell his ticket to make money for his family would have been wonderful, but Burton failed to establish a precedent for it. So sad.<br/><br/>Burton hopes to create a darker, crazier version of Wonka through Johnny Depp, who happens to be one of my favorite actors. What he created, however, was a Wonka who behaves like an infant throughout the entire movie. Depp tries too hard, and comes off as a character with absolutely no depth and no credibility. He has no soul. After meeting Wonka for the first time, I was hoping that at some point, Depp would drop the superficial act and be the dynamic, crazy, enigmatic man who is Willy Wonka. As it is, Depp fails even to show pride for his life's work. He succeeds only at creating forced awkwardness that ruins the allure and character of Wonka. He fails to establish any ownership over his own factory which literally ruins the movie.<br/><br/>As for the dialogue, it felt like it was written by a 3rd grader. Wonka speaks in failed, broken colloquialisms throughout the film. It feels entirely forced, and the dialogue does not allow for the characters to grow.<br/><br/>What was most disappointing about the movie were the moments that gave me hope for how much better it could have been. In the last scene, Wonka and Charlie share a mutual glimmer that had not been seen throughout the entire film. If Burton intended to give Womka a depraved side, he actually came out as an awkward elementary schooler, who seems totally indifferent to absolutely everything around him. The pinnacle of this disaster, is the contrast of Wilder and Depp in reaction to Augustus swimming in the chocolate. While Wilder nearly suffers an emotional breakdown at the sight of fat German hands contaminating his life's work, Depp barely flinches. The lack of heart and soul made this film totally unenjoyable. If there is a positive, it is that I am now driven to read the book and watch the old movie as quickly as possible to restore my love for this fantastic story."

","It's a fact that Roald Dahl did not like ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory,"" the first adaptation of one of his most famous works. Years later, Tim Burton has directed ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,"" hoping to adhere more faithfully to Dahl's book. With Johnny Depp as Willy Wonka, the movie finds a darker tone. Depp's performance is a wonderful combination of a friendly man-child and a creepy character with dark secrets. The imagery is amazing, as Burton has done for many of his movies. Much has been made of such details as the waterfall of chocolate, and the specially-trained squirrels. While trying to be faithful to the original story, Burton adds a fascinating look at Wonka's background. What made him become a chocolatier? He was rebelling against his father, a dentist on an anti-candy campaign. This elements adds another strange facet to Depp's performance. ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" has proved itself a tasty entry in Tim Burton's canon."

","Charlie and the Chocolate factory is an excellent classic story about Willy Wonka's chocolate factory and a boy who has to goes against five kids to get the ultimate prize (though this boy isn't really competing, he is simply enjoying the chocolate factory tour Willy Wonka has been guiding him on). If you say that you don't want to see it because you have already seen the musical I would like you to know that this movie is probably better because Tim Burton has made Roald Dahl's characters more real and it is easier to get this story than the other one because it gives better definition of the characters. Throughout the movie Willy Wonka has flashbacks of his childhood making this eccentric character more real (I won't tell you what the flashbacks contain for it would ruin the story but they really give better definition of Willy Wonka). The new Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is an excellent movie that I think everyone who loved the musical would enjoy as well."
"Jhcbiinoc","10","9","17","15 July 2005"," WOW! Highly entertaining and a must see.
","That's my one word review. One of the best and one of the most well written, directed and made movies I have seen in a long time. First one in a long while to exceed my expectations. I will probably see it again (at least) once just to catch anything I might have missed the first time. But on to the details.....<br/><br/>The 1971 movie that was based on this book still remains one of my all time favorite films. But no matter what people tell you, this is definitely not a mere remake. This is a re-telling of the classic children's book that was my absolute favorite as a child. And it is very faithful to the source material, down to most of the dialogue. Yes, there are some updates (good ones, to the four bratty kids and a subplot that was not in the book where we find out who Wonka is and why he got so zany), but beyond that, it's one of the better adapatations of a book I have seen on film.<br/><br/>From the opening credits with Danny Elfman's amazing score, you can tell that this is going to be a visual treat, with a very well done (although mostly CGI, but it's good CGI) opening sequence of the process of making Wonka bars that is classic Tim Burton. But fear not: This is not just ""eye candy""; the characters are well acted, the story unfolds at the right pace, and the entire movie is very entertaining.<br/><br/>We are treated to some background on Willy Wonka, get to know Charlie and the Bucket family (the part of Charlie is well acted) and the other four children who win the Golden Tickets. This part alone is entertaining enough, but then we get to the factory and the fireworks really start.<br/><br/>I admit, I was skeptical of Johnny Depp in the role of Wonka when I first heard about it. But he nails it. I was not at any time reminded of Michael Jackson, but rather of a bizarre cross between a Mike Myers character (only with a lot more substance), a Monty-Pythonish character, and I'm not sure what. But his wackiness is one of the things that really make the film; at the packed house I saw this at, he got most of the laughs (one of the Grandmothers and the other kids, particularly Veruca, got some as well). His performance is very different from Gene Wilder's, but equally entertaining.<br/><br/>The factory is visually amazing, and features everything from a chocolate river rapids ride to a room full of pink sheep to a room full of squirrels that are very sensitive about their nuts to heavy metal Oompa Loompas. I won't give too much away, but the kids meeting their fates for misbehaving are nicely updated and extremely well done-and more faithful to the book than the 1971 adaptation. The Oompa Loompas are great, their songs are very entertaining, and the one guy who played them all did a good job.<br/><br/>The ending is also great.....one of the biggest laughs came from the final shot of the film.<br/><br/>All in all, it was a very entertaining film, with off the wall humor (and a few double entendres that the adults will get but the kids won't), amazing visuals, and good storytelling. I almost gave it a 9 rather than a 10 only because some of the scenes in the trailer and in the commercials for some reason were edited out (none of the best ones, but some little things, for example, the ""don't lick my boat"" bit, the ""back off, you little freaks!"" and the line about ""dear old fish, go boil your head"" and a few other things, but they don't take anything away from the movie and will more than likely show up on the DVD. It's too good of a film to give anything less than a 10, and perfect family entertainment."

Depp and Burton have stated, numerous times, that they are not ""remaking"" the first movie. They are making a new movie, based on the book. Depp has never even seen the old movie before, on purpose. Also, looking at the other side of things, they are NOT trying to purposefully be unlike the old movie either! If anyone thinks Tim Burton would be that petty, they don't know Tim Burton's attitude towards film making. Okay, now that that's off my shoulders. The movie was excellent. I went in not knowing what to expect and came out with a grin that wouldn't go away. The effects were great, the acting was magnificent throughout, and thank god they cast Depp instead of some of the other strange considerations they were thinking of. To some who say Jim Carey should have played the role, I say...dead wrong you are. Jim Carey has made one good movie, and that was eternal sunshine. He's not a good comedian and I hope he realizes that soon. Anyway, I digress.

Just because technology is there to make movies it doesn't make a movie is good or worth watching.

I really don't understand what all the caterwauling is about. You would have thought that Tim Burton produced a film advocating Satanism for children or something. It's really not that serious and people need to get a grip. To be clear I have seen both the original older rendition and this one and I HAVE ENJOYED BOTH. It's a DIFFERENT movie and I find the acting therein SUPERB. I have watched this film many times and the jokes, facial expression and banter never get old. The cast did an outstanding job. I find myself laughing EACH and EVERY time I watch this. As far parental advisories I watch this with my children all the time. (Admittedly there about perhaps TWO scenes that may be very briefly disturbing.) And I am big on parental guidance when it comes to movies and I am quick to protect my little ones and quick to protest, yes PROTEST, when Hollyweird gets out of line. But I really don't see what the fuss is about. (But of course, it is clearly for each parent to decide.) For those who insist on comparing this film to the original and posting your protestations online please calm down. Know that you are doing the public a diservice with your hysterics.

","Great remake! I did like a movie-movie-book comparison, so I read Roald Dahl's book then watched the 71 version then the modern version. I found Gene Wilder's performance of Wonka to be too soft and not as crazy, wild, or childish as Dal's original portrayal. He acted too much like a father figure. Johnny Depp did much better as the crazy willy wonka we all know and love. The new one was much more accurate. The few things that were not accurate was wonka's physical appearance, in the book wonka had a long scruffy black beard, wonka's flashbacks were never included in the book and there was no fizzy floaty soda. Also, the umpa lumpas weren't dressed as little orange little men with green jumpers. Other than that it was a great movie worth buying!"
"EdnaWelthorpe","6","5","8","18 July 2010"," Could have been worse but could have been much better.
","This was a film that I had high hopes for when it came out. I loved the 1971 movie and of course, Gene Wilder's performance as Wonka is one for the ages. Nonetheless it does deviate from the book quite a bit so I was very interested to see if Tim Burton would present a more faithful adaptation. All the magazines seemed to say so. I saw the film about a month after it came out and I must say -- -- I was quite underwhelmed.<br/><br/>There are good things about the film. The visuals are excellent, Burton does a terrific job modernizing the story to fit the plot (or is it the other way around?) and the supporting cast are pretty good. The other kids are as bratty as can be remembered and I liked that they actually went ahead with the nut checking squirrels (talk about your double entendre -- hehe).<br/><br/>However this film has two very big problems that hurt it in my opinion.<br/><br/>1. Johnny Depp's performance as Wonka. Boy, talk about a let down. I don't know whose idea it was to portray Wonka as some sort of Michael Jackson figure but it was a big mistake. Whereas Wilder's Wonka was charming, devious, clearly intelligent and most importantly, had a nicely defined dark edge to him, Depp's Wonka was just plain annoying. Depp is incredibly awkward, silly and shows no sign of the intelligence, creativity or control that makes him the genius as he's supposed to be in the story. In fact if you were to have never read the book or seen the first movie, there is no way anyone can believe that this wincing wreck who has Vietnam like flashbacks could be the greatest candy creator of all time.<br/><br/>Honestly, Depp should have just brought along Captain Jack Sparrow to portray Wonka. Sparrow actually is far closer to Wonka than what his portrayal of Wonka ended up being.<br/><br/>2. Wonka's back story. Honestly this was just completely unnecessary. Why did Tim Burton decide that this was a good idea? Does the audience really need to know that Wonka was the son of a dentist (played in paycheck receiving fashion by Christopher Lee) who hated candy and was abandoned by him? Do we even care? I mean honestly, how arrogant does one have to be to decide that a 200 page Roald Dahl story is not enough to adapt and instead puts in a back story that adds nothing but time to the movie and ends up being more of a detraction? Not only that, it makes it an abrupt shift since we're supposed to be focused on Charlie and suddenly, we have Willy Wonka's childhood!? Oy.<br/><br/>Overall, a moderately satisfying film that unfortunately falls short of the potential it could have achieved. That's also why I say the 1971 version is the superior one. At least their changes to the story didn't involve frequent, time-consuming flashbacks."
"Isaac5855","5","5","8","11 April 2007"," The Tim Burton Adaptation of a Childhood Classic...
","CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY is Tim Burton's dark adaptation of Roald Dahl's novel, which was turned into the cheery musical WILLIE WONKA AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY back in 1971, with Gene Wilder in the title role. The story is basically the same. Five children from around the world find golden tickets inside candy bars made by world famous candy maker Willie Wonka, which allow them a tour inside the never before open to the public factory, led by Wonka himself, in which the children learn some rather unsettling lessons about being a kid. It should be mentioned that this review comes from someone who never read the book but was a huge fan of the 1971 film. This film does have a solid fan base because the story is more closely connected to the book than the first film was, but that doesn't necessarily make it a better film. I had a lot of problems with this film, the primary one being Burton and Johnny Depp's interpretation of the character of Willie Wonka, which clearly had to be a collaborative effort. As dark as the book might have been, I have always felt that this was supposed to be a children's story and that Wonka should be an appealing character to children. Depp works very hard at producing a completely unique interpretation of the character but this Wonka comes off as hating children, which I found troubling. There is a mean-spiritedness to this Wonka that was absent in Gene Wilder's characterization. He's not a nice person and why the children would be so enamored of him here makes no sense. The children are nastier than they were in the original as well...Mike Teevee, in particular, is one of the nastiest children I have ever seen in a movie. I also found something rather unsettling about the fact that the Oompa Loompas were all played by a single actor (Deep Roy). On the plus side, I thought Freddie Highmore was absolutely wonderful in the pivotal role of Charlie, the only good little boy in the bunch. Highmore makes Charlie the only really likable character in the movie and the only actor from this version I preferred from the 71 version. Another thing I liked in this version is that we get to see the other four children leaving the factory after the tour, which we didn't in the '71 film. In the first film, you get the feeling that they might be dead...a lesson from Wonka which is also troubling. Mention should also be made of an impressive turn by the great Christopher Lee, playing Wonka's father...a character we never met in the '71 film but whose presence here does provide some insight into this Wonka's personality. The songs are dark and dreary but the film does boast impressive art and set direction. A mixed bag to be sure, but you'll probably like it better if you never saw the '71 film."
"exterminator_99","7","5","8","16 January 2006"," Short review of Tim Burton's return to form
","Thankfully Tim Burton has rebounded back with his retelling of Roald Dahl's 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory'. A Burton-speciality, 'Charlie' is vivid, imaginative, childlike and slightly unerringly dark. It is brought to life by Johnny Depp's wonderful take on Willy Wonka, the slightly kooky chocolate factory owner who gives five children around the world the chance to win a visit to his mysterious chocolate factory. When the lavish production design fails to lift the story - there are slightly flat sections of the narrative - it's Depp's performance that carries the film, ultimately helping it surpass the 1974 Gene Wilder version by some distance. Truer to the source material than its earlier adaptation, you feel this is the version Dahl would have preferred: he was apparently known to truly detest children, a sentiment echoed by Depp as Wonka. Well worth repeat viewings, and kids will love the set design and the nut sorting room scene, which is the film's production highlight without doubt."
"segratz","8","5","8","25 August 2005"," Cool, Strange, & Fun
","You want a weird movie? This is the one to see! I enjoyed this movie immensely because of Johnny Depp's strange portrayal of Willy Wonka, which is frightening, funny, and overall just cool. Unfortunately, and this may just be my hang up, whenever I see little Freddy Highmore (who play Charlie) I'm haunted by his portrayal of a sad little orphan in Finding Neverland. I tried to get over it and I think he is a great kid actor, but it added a tinge of sadness to the film for me. This shouldn't both most viewers though. I enjoyed all the cool new plot lines that vary from the original film including the Oompa Loompa history, Wonka's hang ups with his father, and Charlie's sweet parents. It's a great kids film, very colorful, and I can appreciate this film just as much as Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory of long ago from my early childhood. See it!"
"didi-5","9","5","8","21 August 2005"," a successful remake!
","One of the better films to come out of the remake factory, Tim Burton's version of Roald Dahl's beloved book is an unqualified success.<br/><br/>Setting aside memories of the 1970s Gene Wilder Willy Wonka, here we have Johnny Depp with ghostly pallor, squeaky giggle - altogether a more creepy and weird prospect (and very like Michael Jackson, whether this was intentional or not).<br/><br/>Charlie Bucket - cute little Freddie Highmore - is so obsessed with Willy Wonka and his factory that he has built a replica in his house. he only gets one choccie bar a year but hopes to find the elusive Golden Ticket which will get him into the factory. The first four tickets are snapped up by stereotypical kiddie horrors - Angustus Gloop, who just eats and eats; Veruca Salt, a spoilt brat from Buckinghamshire; Violet Beauregarde, gum chewing, kick-boxing American champion; and Mike Teavee, obsessed with the flickering box in the corner of the room and his noisy Playstation.<br/><br/>Of course Charlie gets his ticket, too (it wouldn't be Charlie and the Chocolate Factory if he didn't) and off we go into an inventive trip around a magical, crazy place populated by numerous identical Oompa Loompas (lots of computer generated Deep Roys singing and dancing in formation). The fun as ever is seeing how the horrid kids get their just desserts during the trip.<br/><br/>Illustrious casting (James Fox, Helena Bonham-Carter, David Kelly, Liz Smith, Christopher Lee) and fabulous special effects (the Great Glass Elevator; the river of chocolate; the trained squirrels; the Oompa Loompas), together with Dahl's dark humour, make this a confection to be savoured.<br/><br/>May be a little scary for the smaller child, but this is a surprisingly good film. Wonka's character is a little more developed than in the earlier film, and although the ending has been tweaked in true American saccharine fashion, it works. It has the feel of a Christmas release rather than a summer blockbuster, but there's nothing wrong with that.<br/><br/>I especially loved the Oompa Loompas' different musical styles for the songs, from disco to heavy metal - inspired!"
"krzykra","10","5","8","16 August 2005"," Pure Imagination!
","This movie is pure imagination all over again for Wonka fans and anyone else! First of all, yes, it is like the book, yes, it is different than the 1971 version, yes, there is no doubt Tim Burton directed this movie, and no, Johnny Depp didn't remind me of Michael Jackson (maybe because I wasn't obsessed with following Mr. Jackson's trial like everybody else).<br/><br/>This timeless children's classic is extremely faithful to Roald Dahl's quirky world, while appealing to a whole new generation of kids and families. And who better to create a quirky world than the master of quirkiness, Tim Burton. Much like Hitchcock's famous cameos, there are plenty of Burton-like images all throughout the film (including a brief image of Wonka holding a pair of scissors that reminds us of another Burton-Depp collaboration). The visuals are absolutely stunning, so stunning that you could almost watch the movie with the sound down and still be entertained.<br/><br/>The acting is all first rate. Johnny Depp's originality never ceases to amaze me. And Freddie Highmore is wonderful as usual (if you haven't seen his performance in Finding Neverland, see it). The nasty kids do a good job of mixing reality with their broad characters, and their equally nasty parents are the same. Once again, the classic book is appropriately brought into our modern life while sticking to the timeless quality of the story. Most notably are the Beauregarde's, hilariously brought to life by Missi Pyle and AnnaSophia Robb (quite the versatile little actress, for those who have seen Samantha and Because of Winn-Dixie). Here we have the pushy cheerleader mom who has created an obnoxious little clone of herself (know anyone like that?). And Mike Teavee is not only obsessed with television, but now, with video games (know any kids like that?). I cannot mention the entire cast, but everyone else did a terrific job, too.<br/><br/>Fans of the Gene Wilder version (and I am included in that list) will be pleasantly surprised (especially with the inclusion of such chapters as ""The Other Children Go Home"", a rather wickedly satisfying chapter, but I won't give anything away), and fans of the book (I am included in that list, too) will be pleased to see a movie that is as faithful to the book as you can get and have it still be a movie."

","I don't usually go big on kids movies. Animation, for instance, makes me grit my teeth. The Harry Potter movies left me exceptionally unimpressed. I went into Charlie and the Chocolate Factory half expecting to be bored after the first half an hour.<br/><br/>OK, it's got quite a bit going for it - Tim Burton is not exactly a beginner, although his films have been a bit uneven. Johnny Depp's forte has long been fantasy, and the combination has yielded some of Burton's directorial best (Edward Scissorhands, Ed Wood, Sleepy Hollow). Finally though the team have come up with their most polished and flawless work yet. Charlie and the Chocolate Factory sweeps you away with a magic and poetry whilst keeping you on the edge of your seat for the next development. Roald Dahl's incredible, eccentric brand of children's' storytelling is a joy to experience, for young and old alike."
"dtb","9","5","8","18 July 2005"," Tim Burton and Roald Dahl: A Movie Marriage Made in Candyland
","When my husband and I heard that Tim Burton was making a new film version of Roald Dahl's CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY starring his favorite leading man Johnny Depp as Willy Wonka, the world's quirkiest candy maker, we knew it would be a perfect match of filmmaker and source material, and indeed it is! Burton's inventive imagination and dark, twisted sense of humor suits Dahl's gleeful misogyny perfectly, yet still results in a family-friendly film simply because, like Depp's Willy Wonka, it doesn't pander to the young'uns. Indeed, Wonka doesn't even seem to like the golden-ticket-winning kids he invites to his weird and wonderful confection factory, though in his own oddball way Wonka eventually warms up to our hero Charlie Bucket (Freddie Highmore). Who wouldn't like the selfless, poor-but-thankful-for-his-blessings Charlie, especially compared to the four spoiled brats competing against him for the ""special prize"" Wonka dangles before them? The kids' acting styles work well, with young Highmore's un-actorish down-to-earth quality playing off well against the appropriately flamboyant brattiness of AnnaSophia Robb (as super-competitive Violet Beauregarde), Julia Winter (Veruca Salt, the overindulged rich kid), Jordan Fry (Mike Teevee, now an aggressive video game freak as well as a television addict) and Philip Wiegratz (Augustus Gloop, a sweet-faced but selfish glutton). Wonka is also given a back story of funny yet poignant strife with dad Christopher Lee, a dentist (!) who takes his work just a little too seriously. This angle could have been as overly sweet as a bad piece of candy, but the cast, Burton, and screenwriter John August work it gracefully into the family theme. Unlike Wonka, Charlie has a loving relationship with his eccentric family (all played with warmth and wit by a cast of fascinating faces, especially David Kelly as Grandpa Joe, Noah Taylor as Charlie's dad, and Helena Bonham Carter as Charlie's cabbage-soup-making mom). It helps that Depp and Highmore have good chemistry. (Fun Fact: Depp recommended Highmore to Burton after working with the lad in FINDING NEVERLAND. Another FN veteran in the cast: Eileen Essell of DUPLEX fame, playing Charlie's Grandma Josephine.) With Alex McDowell's production design, Philippe Rousselot's lush photography, and Gabriella Pescucci's costume design, the movie is deliriously gorgeous to look at, like a collaboration between Edward Gory and Peter Max. Thanks to the deadpan performance (or should I say performances? :-) of a CGI-multiplied Deep Roy, along with Danny Elfman's fabulously fun score -- with songs based on lyrics from Roald Dahl himself, yet reminiscent of Elfman's work with Oingo Boingo -- the Oompa-Loompas' production numbers are a delight to watch and listen to (no cover version of ""The Candy Man,"" sorry! :-). Our whole family had a blast -- CHARLIE... is the tastiest sweet-and-sour sugar rush of the summer!"

","When I was going up in the 70s, I really enjoyed watching the original movie. Now that I have young kids myself, I was very excited to take my kids to this new version. I did not realize how well the original film wasthat is how the film was put togetheruntil sitting down and watching this new one with my kids. To make a long story short, there is no way this second film can compare to the original; but, Tim Burton does a good job.<br/><br/>This newer version has a lot of fun-nothing to serious-lots of laughs and cool special effects look to it. Tim and his chosen actors do not drop the ball at all in this very well-made remake. Johnny Depp was great as Willy Wonka and Freddie Highmore was good as Charlie. All others in the film follow-suit.<br/><br/>For those parents who remember the original film (if you're like me) you'll walk away with a better appreciation for the magic the original film created and that same magic Tim Burton creates his this newer version."

","I had the pleasure of taking two of my three children. My seventeen year old daughter loved it, however, my nine year old son didn't care for it. She is a HUGE Depp fan and thought he did an excellent job. I thought the special effects were unique and this movie was much more in line with the book. What I thought was interesting was that Dahl wrote the screenplay for the first movie - to me it was as though, he was trying to appeal to children on their level. Whereas, Burton told the story using flashbacks - for Wonka and this seemed to line up with the theory of psychoanalysis and film.<br/><br/>I would highly recommend this movie to students who have previously read the book. It holds true to that medium and trying to compare it to the previous movie is like trying to compare a bicycle to an automobile."
"joestank15","8","5","8","15 July 2005"," Charlie and the Chocolate Factory
","Charlie and the Chocolate Factory - Tim Burton's take on the famous Ronald Dahl novel. Though Charlie (Freddie Highmore) is sweet, sensitive and good natured, just as Charlie should be, this is Johnny Depp's show. As Willy Wonka, he is kooky, awkward, and always funny. The camera just gravitates to what he is doing at all times. His voice is a sort of hybrid California Girl giggle mixed with someone slightly Canadian. And not every other sentence out of his mouth is a literary quote. David Kelly seems far less creepy than he did in the trailer, but rather a very endearing grandfather. The four little devils all have plenty of personality to go around, and sometimes too much so. I think everyone'll be glad to see them meet their inevitable punishment.<br/><br/>Surprisingly, Burton's version is far less dark than the 70's version. I actually liked that we saw the four greedy children alive and well after their mistakes, whereas in the other movie it was rather like ""Maybe they're dead. Maybe they're alright. Who cares?"" This happy ending isn't held back by 4 possibly dead children who paid through the roof for their foolish mistakes, because we see them alright, or severely altered.<br/><br/>I was a little unsure about the script writer John August, because I saw the dastardly Charlies Angels2 movie. Surprisingly this script is filled with humor and moments both tender and awkward (but in a good funny way). Wonka and Charlie both have more fleshed out with family backstories which adds to the characters. Charlie has his loving mother and father (Noah Taylor and Helena Bonham Carter) who we see in quite a few scenes. Wonka has his dentist father (Christopher Lee), whose strict rules on candy caused Wonka to go into the business of candy-making. There are way too many funny quotes to count.<br/><br/>As with all Tim Burton movies, atmosphere is the name of the game. Wonka factory is this giant factory amid all the little people, with Charlie and his family living in this little shack that would not meet even the loosest of building requirements. England is dull and snowy. The jungles of Loompaland are vibrant and earthy. Wonka's factory is bright and colorful. The production values are top-notch.<br/><br/>In conclusion, if you were not taken with the other Charlie and the Chocolate Factory movie, as I was, give this a try. Sorry Gene Wilder, but I like Depp's performance better. This gets an A-"

","Tim Burton's creative genius made this one of the most enjoyable films i've seen all summer. Be open to the fact that he decided to stay more true to the book, where-as the old film did not. Johnny Depp of course is a chameleon and was sincerely spectacular. The humor was refreshing, and honestly I was not expecting the movie to be so funny- a pleasant surprise indeed. All the characters were very well cast. As with all Tim Burton films, the sets were astounding. The shots were brilliant. The understory, about Willy Wonkas background and childhood- which was accompanied by humorous flashbacks, was not in the book and as a result the ending was altered to support this new storyline- which might upset some who were hoping for a duplicate of either the old movie or the book- at first I was irked, but I decided it had been entertaining and so worth putting in the movie."

This movie isn't a tribute to Mr. Wilder, it's not supposed to be like the original. It's a tribute to Mr. Dahl, the original writer of the book that inspires it all. And it's a fine tribute, at that. I was lucky enough to see this at a 'sneak peek,' and would gladly see it again.

","I was always a huge fan of Dahl's book and had read it many times before seeing the original ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory."" The original film left me disappointed, mainly because Wilder's Wonka wasn't how the book had portrayed him, and the added scene with Charlie and Grandpa Joe sneaking a drink of the lifting stuff made Charlie out to be sort of a ""bad"" kid for an instant. This movie, however, has gotten the book onto film almost perfectly. The sets, costumes, characters are absolutely breathtaking-- they're all insanely colorful and unique and entirely Tim Burton's style. Johnny Depp played Willy Wonka very well. I won't get into specifics, but the approach he took with the character was less of Wilder's ""father figure"" and more of a brilliant and eccentric, yet somewhat callous, inventor. This movie will captivate audiences from the very beginning. I only wish Roald Dahl was still alive to see a movie that does justice to his classic book."

I took my kids to see this movie at a sneak preview and they loved it. Johnny Depp is an excellent Willie Wonka, and gives it a great twist to the character. Johnny Depp has the ability to create a character that fits the roll. If you have seen Freddie Highmore in Finding Neverland, he was the best choice to play Charlie. Each character was well chosen and the humor is great. The script also gives wonder background to who Willie Wonka was before he became the eccentric later on in life. This is way better than the original. So if you watch it will be for pure enjoyment, taking you back to the simplicity of childhood, but with the complexity to remain true to the original book."

There are only two things that bugs me; one of them is very subjective; when I've read the book back in the days, I've always dreamt the the insides of the chocolate factory would have a blue sky so it would have a much more brighter atmosphere from the dark and cold city thus it would create a great contrast. The second thing that bugged me is much more objective but it's far less important when compared; the narrator appears at the beginning of the movie, establishing things just like in the book, then... he's gone. And then the appears out of nowhere. It feels a little disjointed. Burton took the source material, respected it more than any other comic or novel based production and achieved something bigger than lots of other comic or novel based movie. Well done."

","This film was released when I was 8 and I remember being really excited to see it at the cinema. The film didn't disappoint and after I got the DVD, I couldn't stop watching it. Fast forward almost 10 years after it's release, it is still one of my favourite films. The plot revolves around Charlie Bucket, a poor boy who has luckily won a ticket to visit Willy Wonka's factory along with four other children and the chaos that happens during the tour. I have seen many of Tim Burton's films so I knew this wasn't going to be a subtle adaptation and of course Johnny Depp would be in it. So if you've never liked any of Burton's films or aren't a fan of Depp, then I can guarantee you will not like this film. Burton and Depp fans though will most likely love this film. I think Depp is great as the main character, Willy Wonka, who is a chocolate tier and has recently reopened his factory to 5 lucky winners after closing it when workers stole his recipes and sold them. Is Depp better than Gene Wilder's Wonka? I'm not going to compare the two as they're both very different and great films, which happen to be an adaptation of the same book. But Depp does bring a lot of energy and comedy to the character, which I love. Freddie Highmore brings a really good performance as Charlie despite being only 12/13 at the time of filming but then again if you watch his other performances, especially Finding Neverland which he was in with Depp, you can see why Burton chose him for his character. I love the humour in this film, I don't think I've ever laughed so much at a film. The music in this film, created by the talented Danny Elfman, is brilliant and so catchy and make me love the film even more. All in all, a fantastic film. 8/10"

","Charlie and the chocolate factory, directed by tim burton and starred by Johnny Depp, Freddie Highmore and others, is a humorous fantasy film based mainly on Ronald Dahl's classic of all time ""Charlie and the chocolate factory"". It lasts for 2 hours and 10 minutes and hit the theatre in 2005.<br/><br/>The film comes with a simple yet enthralling storyline, describing the uncanny adventure which the stunt person, Charlie, has experienced. It all begins with a tremendous stroke of luck befalling Charlie and his destitute family. Charlie finds the fifth golden ticket and sets out an adventure with his grandpa Joe to the mythical chocolate factory. <br/><br/>In the factory, Charlie and Grandpa Joe marvel at the unbelievable sights, sounds, and especially smells of the factory. Whereas they are grateful toward and respectful of Mr. Wonka and his factory, the other four children succumb to their own character flaws. Accordingly, they are removed from the factory in painful fashions. Augustus falls into the hot chocolate river and is sucked up by one of the many pipes. Veruca is thrown out into the trash. Violet imprudently grabs an experimental piece of gum and chews herself into a giant blueberry. With the hope of being on his beloved television, Mike shrinks himself, and his father has to carry him out in his breast pocket. After others' fiasco, when only Charlie remains, Willy Wonka turns to him and congratulates him for winning. The entire day has been another contest, the prize for which is the entire chocolate factory, which Charlie has just won. <br/><br/>Having watched this film a few times before, I still find it inspirational and intriguing. To commence with, the storyline is very humorous and memorable. I can still recall how the four other kids in the film make hideous mistakes during the course of visiting the factory and end up being inflated,shrunk in size and thrown by squirrels. And how Charlie remains virtuous and meek in times of adversity after his dad has been sacked. And how eccentric Mr. Willy Wonka is throughout the film. These scenes really stick to my mind indelibly and still make me smile and feel sad when I think about them. Unlike other adventure films, Charlie and the chocolate factory doesn't use special effects as a gimmick to attract people. Instead, every songs and lines are immaculately crafted in an attempt to reflect the vividness of the characters. It startles me that I wasn't even bored the whole time! On the contrary, I was deeply attracted and remained avid during the two hours, even though I have watched many times before. And I believe it will always be a treat to watch no matter how many times i have already watched it.<br/><br/>Though it is indubitably praiseworthy and has been my all time favourite, I do think there is room for improvement. The music, for example, is incongruous with the theme. The songs performed by the Oompa-Loompas are not only disturbing, but also lousy and loathsome. I have a distaste for their tribal music as much as women have a distaste for insects. To add oil to the fire, they even sing a song after each child's failure! Those songs do not strike a harmonious chord with me and are not catchy at all. They have put a damper on the film. <br/><br/>In spite of all these, the film does have its unique charm. Overall speaking, the film still seems to me as worthwhile and I am unwavering in giving recommendation of this film whenever I am asked. Anyone who wants to spend a cosy evening will want to watch Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. Trust me."

Then he'll live an awesome adventure that wins in a contest of the Chocolate Factory.<br/><br/>I didn't expect that much joy and happiness this movie made me feel. It's all about parenting.

","Tim Burton's imagination produces, once again, images that are mesmerizing.<br/><br/>Charlie & the Chocolate Factory is a multi-layered confection that serves simultaneously as an allegorical story for children and a pop culture cornucopia for adults.<br/><br/>The first part of the movie concerns Charlie Buckets, a poor boy who is rich in familial love. He is one of five children who find golden tickets in their Wonka chocolate bars, allowing them to tour the Wonka factory. The other four are poster children for Spoiled Brat Syndrome.<br/><br/>When the gates to the factory open to start the tour, it marks the second part of the film, much as Dorothy's entrance into Munchkinland. After that, the cultural references fly as fast as a glass elevator.<br/><br/>Mr. Wonka, as played by Johnny Depp, is part Mr. Rogers, part Carol Channing, with just a smidge of Church Lady. But it's the factory--and its processes--that are the star of the film.<br/><br/>Note the references to Shrek, Monty Python, Dr. Seuss, Busby Berkeley, Gulliver's Travels, Hair, Psycho, 2001: A Space Odyssey, Prince, The Beatles, Kiss, The Fly, The Beach Boys, and so much more. Much of it has a sixties-inspired Beatlesque style--an acid trip of psychedelic images. The actual story becomes secondary to the film's sensory stimulation. It's a visual and aural feast that is delightful. The special effects are seamless, the music inspired."
"kyle-cruse","8","3","4","18 September 2008"," It surprised me, being a fan of the original
","I have been a fan of the movie ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"" for many years now. I have also taken great pleasure in reading the novel by Roald Dahl. After seeing previews for this film, I had doubts that a remake like this would work for me. I thought I would love the original too much to like anything about this film. Nevertheless, I was wrong about ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory."" I was uncertain about Johnny Depp playing Willy Wonka, not sure he had the right potential for this particular character. Depp actually played the role superbly, creating a character so over-the-top and zany that I'm sure Roald Dahl would have been pleased. Freddie Highmore plays Charlie very well also, coming across as the innocent, poor boy made manifest by the book as well as the original movie. AnnaSophia Robb also stands out to me as Violet Beauverguard. This version also restored some sections of the book not made into film in the original version, such as the story of how Willy Wonka found his Oompa-Loompas and building a chocolate castle for a rich prince. Also, this film adds a great new story that is both touching and fascinating, the story of Willy Wonka's dad (Christopher Lee), the dentist who drove him to rebel and create a chocolate factory. This is actually my favorite section of this movie. Not a perfect movie, as the original was for me. I miss many of the original songs such as ""Pure Imagination"" from that film. Nevertheless, this film did not try to copy that one but rather relied on the novel. If you're uncertain about this remake, take it from a fan of the original: this one is worth seeing.<br/><br/>*** out of ****"

I watched it at least 3 times a month since it came out on video years ago. I did not think there could ever be a remake that I would like of this wonderful story. My husband and I went to see Charlie and the Chocolate Facotory at the local IMAX theater. We loved it! It is enough the same and enough different. Johnny Depp was fantastic! I still love the old one but it is a toss up of which one is my favorite. I will have to get the DVD and view it many more times to determine. As for those that feel it is too scary for young children...NOT! They said the same thing about the first one when I was a kid. It is great for kids to watch! It teaches that parents that don't do their job...end up with spoiled brats! And spoiled brats get nothing but pain and agony and nice little children (with Character)win.

Gene Wilder was wonderful in the original and there is no need to compare the new and old one.

","I saw this movie in Johnstown, NY on the night before I left for camp. I wanted to see it, and boy, am I glad I did. It was sooooo much better than the original. Johnny Depp is one of my favorite actors, but he was slightly creepy as Willy Wonka. Which I think was intended. Freddie Highmore re-teams with Depp, after playing Peter in ""Finding Neverland"", and plays a wonderful Charlie Bucket. He has the strongest performance of the child actors. The only weak performance was Philip Wiegratz as Augustus Gloop, which I think was because he wasn't on for very long. My favorite character, like the original, was Violet Beauregarde (AnnaSophia Robb). They changed her a little bit for the new movie, but she still was quite enjoyable. Robb has done work in ""Because of Winn-Dixie"" which I have yet to see. I hope you enjoy this version of ""Chocolate Factory"", because I certainly did!"

","Utterly GENIUS!!! Oh this movie did EVERYTHING right. They made Willy Wonka how he should be, a guy who is weird and has been cut off from society for a long time. Then the Oompa Loompa songs were better too, apparently they were more true to the Roald Dahl songs in the book. Then the kids were more animated, like the kids just acted like really nasty kids, except Verucka who I thought was nastier in the original, but I think this Verucka is better, because she is also very proper. Then the music, I think what really made me enjoy this was the music, Danny Elfman is a very talented composer. Except if you watch ""Batman Returns"" with Michael Keaton, you'll hear the exact same music in some spots."

","I've been anticipating this movie's arrival ever since April, and now, FINALLY, last night I was able to see it. It wasn't in the main theaters anymore, in fact, it was only showing at the cheap $2 per person theater. Nevertheless, I was extremely excited to see Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, one of the summer's greatest hits.<br/><br/>From the first few moments, my eyes were wide with disbelief. From the Bucket's crooked house to Willy Wonka's somewhat wacky hairdo, my jaw was on the ground. The plot, the cast, the scenery, all of it was magnificent.<br/><br/>First, the plot. I already knew the story of Willy Wonka's chocolate factory and the five golden tickets placed in five ordinary candy bars from watching the original movie as well as reading the book. This movie, unlike the older version of the film, was much more magical and a tad bit more believable. The inside of the factory was glorious, and Willy Wonka was just as crazy as he could be.<br/><br/>And speaking of Willy Wonka, it's time to move on to the cast. I would bet most of my money on the fact that Johnny Depp is going to get another Academy Award nomination for the third year in a row. He portrays Wonka to his brilliance, complete childish antics and expressions. Freddie Highmore as Charlie is just as good as Depp. I haven't seen him in Finding Neverland, but my dad and I intend to rent that movie just to see how both Depp and Highmore act in it. The children chosen to play the genuine brats that, well, in most of their cases (aka not Veruca) find the golden ticket, are gems of the screen as well. They play the characters to their nasty core and are the kids you love to hate. The members of the Bucket family are wonderful too, especially Grandpa Joe and the other grandparents.<br/><br/>The inside of the factory is perfectly magical, and because of this, the movie had its final touch of greatness.<br/><br/>Wonderful direction, brilliant cast, and much more make Charlie and the Chocolate Factory a tour through the factory that you cannot miss. It doesn't take a golden ticket to go see this film, so I recommend seeing it to anyone who hasn't already."

","Charlie and the Chocolate factory was an excellent feel good film. It gave great insight into the master chocaltier and explained a lot of un-answered questions left from the original Gene Wilder flick. Johnny Depp portrayed Willy Wonka expertly and i feel it was a great role for him, he and Tim Burton are one of the best actor/director duos of the 21st Century. Freddie Highmore gave Charlie Bucket a realistic feel and gave him a more developed character. The ending was the most climatic where Charlie was torn between the factory and his family, but it also helped to develop Depp's character further because he finally realized that a family is everything to a little boy, just because he didn't have a good childhood it didn't mean that he had to frown upon others. Christopher Lee portrayed his father excellently, giving the character a cold hard repressive state. He loved his son but he just didn't know how to express that love, until the end. The final scene being the most heart warming. It was a great movie and it is one when it comes to DVD in Australia i will buy and watch over and over again, Tim Burton is an excellent director."

","This movie was far greater than I could have ever imagined. When I first heard they were remaking the old one I didn't want to go see it at all. Now I have seen it three times! The reason for this being that i simply hate the old one! I read the original Roald Dahl book and loved it heaps. So much that I went to see the movie after I heard it was truer to the book. ( I heard Roal Dahl hated the old one too). Tim Burton , Danny Elfman and Johnny Depp ( plus the rest of the crew) have created something that is about 90% true to the book. And we have to admit thats more than the old one. The only exception being that of Willy Wonkas back story. I thought this was cleverly thought out but also unnecessary. The music in this film just makes it as close to perfect as a film can be. Danny Elfmans Oompa-Loompa songs are excellent and I love the way he used Roald Dahls original lyrics. ( They are much better than the lame ones from the first movie)Although I thought that in the movie it was actually a little hard to hear and understand the lyrics. So I went back to the book plus listened to the songs from the soundtrack to understand them better. Tim Burtons creativity in this movies is some what weird and whacky. But I love it all the same. Its just as though it has jumped out of my imagination and onto the big screen. Johnny Depps performance is hilarious! A lot of people don't like the film because of his just plain weirdness. But I think that someone who has lived in a factory his whole life deserves to be a little bit weird. This is a very colourful and creative film that should be seen be everyone young or old!!!"

I was moved to tears on a couple of occasions.<br/><br/>I had re-read the book a few days before seeing the movie and was pleased to see that for the most part, this movie was faithful to the book. A few additional creative touches were added, which I felt did not detract from the overall story, but gave fans of the book something additional to enjoy.<br/><br/>The acting was excellent, especially from the kids, who lived up to their characters superbly. The sets and colour were fantastic and a good Dahl interpretation from Tim Burton. Johnny Depp was suitably eccentric as Willy Wonka, altogether different from what I had imagined, but nonetheless enjoyable.<br/><br/>I did not like the original Gene Wilder movie as I felt it too far removed from the story and too Americanised.<br/><br/>One aspect that I found disappointing was the Oompa Loompa songs. The music drowned out Dahl's lyrics, so the lessons we were supposed to be learning from the obnoxious kids were somewhat lost in a mumble.<br/><br/>Possibly slightly long for the under 6's but perfect in my book. 8/10"

","To anyone who may remember the original ""Chocolate Factory"" may want to throw everything they know about the original out the window. The new version is indeed different as night and day.<br/><br/>In this new version, Charlie (Freddie Highmore) who portrays a much more poorer version of what Charlie should have been, is living with his small but humble family, when everyone hears of the 5 Golden Tickets, the whole world goes on a search for those delectable Wonka Candy Bars and soon, the five kids are found. This is resolved in about 25 minutes compared to the original that had taken almost 45 minutes.<br/><br/>From then on, from the first word to the credits is nothing but a laugh fest filled with visual gags and humorous anecdotes that you may miss at first.<br/><br/>The main difference with the two films, if you were to watch them from the big screen to your TV, is a big difference that most may have seen coming, I didn't, and I'm an avid movie goer.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp, of course from all the trailers, plays the Wonky Willy Wonka. Some people consider that Depp is what made the movie funny or good, they're only half right. Depp provides frequent laughs throughout the film, but to pin the heart and soul of the film onto Depp is what would be Politically Incorrect, Charlie provides the heart and soul that the original Charlie didn't have all too much.<br/><br/>With this Charlie, he's so human and how he acts is what makes you love the kid to death, I felt that with his situations in life, it almost brings a tear to an eye. With this version, it's darker, gloomy, funny, and occasionally sad, particular in the beginning and end. if you going to see the film just for Johnny Depp, you'll be only half full, but if you going to see a film that's got a perfect ending, a very ""How Charlie should have acted"" sort of kid, and by far, one film guaranteed to have your sweet tooth wishing for the entire snack bar in the theater, this one has to be the one."

","The trouble with ""remakes"" is that it inevitably brings comparisons with the previous version rather than the film being allowed to stand on its own merits. However, I took two 11yr old boys to see Charlie & The Chocolate Factory today, and they both came out saying they thought it was great, and definitely wanted to see it again and want it when it comes out on DVD. From them, that's top praise. For me, a film is entertainment and escapism, and I think both are achieved in this movie as far as that goes.<br/><br/>I thought Depp played the role of Wonka really well, and seemed to capture far more of the weirder essence present in Dahl's character, than his predecessor (Gene Wilder). The kids were as I expected, irritating just as they are in the books. Great copy of characterisation from the book! And young Freddie Highmore also seemed to produce the wholesome good boy, beloved of his family, as characterised in the Dahl novel, although what the movie didn't manage to reproduce, was the closeness of Charlie's relationship with ""Grandpa Joe"", which was a shame because it is such an essential ingredient of the original story.<br/><br/>My only real criticism was where the makers chose to take a divert from the book with the invention of Wonka's past. I felt it was totally unnecessary, and feel that they could have used that time more wisely, to develop Charlie and Grandpa Joe's relationship, and given them a bit more talk time as they toured the factory, rather than have them, more observers, at times, than central participants. And by the way, great to see David Kelly (Grandpa Joe) on the big screen, I remember him as ""Alfred"" all those years ago in Robin's Nest!!! Overall, I'd say Tim Burton did a great job and my young critics tell me they think it deserves an 8/10 rating well kids can't be wrong, can they?!!!"

","In this version of Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, I must say that Tim Burton did an okay job in adapting it to a new generation, though, I believe Johnny Depp's acting as Willy Wonka, was a little too exaggerated, I mean he acted a little weird, especially at the ending, but I must say it was clever, and he looked cool, the hat and the hair, he looked Marilyn Manson a bit, and he was really inspired by his look too. And I liked the way he spoke also, especially when he was reading the cards, and when he keeps getting flashbacks, especially when he remembers his dad, I liked that part. And I must say the umpa lumpas(not sure if that's how it's spelled) were very cool, and I liked their songs. Overall a nice movie, but another remake, but it is not one of those bad ones, but still, this has to be one of the most promising movies out there, and this being a Tim Burton film, most of his films are amazing."

","I was a little skeptical when I heard a new version of this story was coming out (especially since I absolutely love the first movie). I must say I was more than pleasantly surprised. This version is so much more true to the book, except for the whole bad childhood of Willy Wonka thing and the ending (which was a little bit of a let down for me). I believe that Depp's Wonka is definitely more of the way Dahl intended him to be. Critics say he is freaky and weird, but to me that is the way he is portrayed in the book. Gene Wilder made him into more of a real person...which he is not. He lives in a fantasy world with hundreds of little men for heavens sake. The one thing that stood out the most to me was how well Burton portrayed four of the seven deadly sins that I believe Dahl wanted us to recognize from the book: greed (Veruca), gluttony (Agustus), pride (Violet) and sloth (Mike). I thought this film was amazing."

Though some people may dislike this version of Roald Dahl's book, it is only because people are so attached to the first. Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is not - I repeat - is NOT a remake of Mel Stuart's 1971 Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory. Burton's film is a make of the book, not the other movie. So I think people would enjoy it more if they didn't keep thinking about how Gene Wilder was so much ""less weird."" Johnny Depp made the movie. I've heard the total opposite and more than once. But it's Love that you see in Depp as he portrays Wonka - that dream role the he's had since he started acting. And finally he gets it and is allowed to have his fun. And you can tell he's having it, too.<br/><br/>Adorable Freddie Highmore in ""Charlie"" does just as good as he did as adorable Freddie Highmore in Finding Neverland. He's a great young actor and just the cutest boy I've seen on screen for a long time.<br/><br/>I find this film enchanting so enjoyable - I could watch it a million times and still get those darn cramps in my mouth from smiling over and over again. I strongly recommend you see it and soon! It's as magical as chocolate could ever be!!"
"mattgstreet","Null","3","4","1 August 2005"," A psychedelic roller coaster. Burton delivers. As usual.
","Given that Tim Burton's previous remake ""Planet of the Apes"" is seen by many as his worst film and also, given that both Dahl's novel and the 1971 adaptation are seen as classics, he was really touching sacred territory when he started work on this project. So initially, I was a little sceptical about this film. But never the less, I put my faith in Burton's skill as a director and bought a ticket.<br/><br/>The combination of Dahl's uniquely dark writing style and Burton's equally unique dark visual style is a match made in heaven. Dahl always had the knack of being to communicate rather adult and mature ideas to a child audience without having to talk down to them and in a similar sense, Burton's view of the world often communicates to the child with in all of us. Be it the fear of the Headless Horseman in Sleepy Hollow, the child like innocence of Edward Scissorhands, Ed Wood's almost child like desire to please his audience or Bruce Wayne's pent up anger and sadness at witnessing the murder of his parents when he was a child in Batman.<br/><br/>First of all, do not compare this to the 1971 film. Any ideas of comparison between the two are totally pointless; this film really is a different kettle of fish entirely. Where as the earlier version put it's own spin on the bulk of the novel, this film owes itself purely to Dahl's vision, Burton's vision and Depp's masterful interpretation of Wonka's character. In this film we see a Wonka who, not only does not like children, but has some sort of phobia or mental condition where the idea of the family unit and parental love sends him into convulsions of sickness and nausea, stemming from his rather dysfunctional upbringing by a fascist father (brilliantly played by Christopher Lee). Does this adequately explain Depp's child like, performance? Absolutely. Does this make his character a little unsettling? Definitely. But this only adds to the mystique of his character, who in order to do the things he has done must be more than a little insane! That is the only aspect of the film where Burton hasn't remained true to the source material; every where else he has remained true to Dahl's story. Other characters have been changed slightly (Mike TV is obsessed with the video games instead of TV), but are still totally recognisable as the characters in the book. The film definitely benefits from the inclusion of Charlie's father (something the '71 version failed to do), giving the sense of a family who, although extremely poor have a strong family bond which makes them richer than all the other spoilt and rude children in the film. Charlie's character perfectly epitomises childlike innocence with Freddie Highmore giving an impressive performance for such a young actor. And you will believe that Grandpa Jo's (superbly portrayed by David Kelly) bedside tales of the miracles of Wonka's chocolate are what captivates Charlie's imagination.<br/><br/>You really do get the sense with this film that it was a labour of love for Burton. He has created a cinematic world that perfectly complements Dahl's literary world with every frame dripping with colour and magic. Put simply: fans of Tim Burton and Roald Dahl will love this film"
"Jack_Acid","7","3","4","31 July 2005"," Burton and Depp strike again
","***MINOR SPOILERS AHEAD*** Well, for those of us who consider themselves Tim Burton fans, this film doesn't disappoint. Burton is yet again able to connect to a wider audience, while still interjecting his darker style and presence. Johnny Depp as Wonka is somewhat of a Jekyll & Hyde character....removed from human contact long before the Gold Ticket winning children arrive; all the while he struggles with his own inner demons when it comes to children, human empathy in general and a closeness to those he loves (in this case, his father.) As expected from Burton, the film's environment and world is greatly exaggerated, which is as the story calls for. Freddie Highmore and David Kelly add a more believable and human side to the film, while Wonka provides the mad hatter elements and quirky dialog. Sometimes his mannerisms and demeanor work and sometimes they don't.<br/><br/>As with most films these days, they could have shaved 20 minutes off of it to keep its pace. For me, that would have included cutting the relatively worthless musical numbers that we're subjected to as each child is dramatically sucked into the factory's inner workings.<br/><br/>However, the message is what we're left with, which is ultimately to be grateful for what you have and good things will come to you. We finally connect more with Wonka as he accepts the concept of family and allowing people to be close to him.<br/><br/>Definitely worth a viewing for visuals alone and memorable performances from Depp and company to boot."
"funkyfry","7","3","4","28 July 2005"," Equal in quality to the original
","I saw this film at the drive ins, lots of fun, really enjoyed the film. I just saw the original film version a few weeks ago so I'm able to make a pretty close comparison and I think they are both about equal. I can see how someone who enjoyed the first version a whole lot would dislike this one because it is very different, but as someone who's always enjoyed it but never considered it one of my favorite films, I really liked seeing a new director and actors take a crack at this one. I like the results, definitely plan on seeing it again.<br/><br/>The production design is of course one of the most impressive parts of the film. Depp's acting is wonderful, the only aspect that bothered me was he borrowed some of his mannerisms from his Hunter Thompson impersonation in ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas"", like when he ate the candy and smacked his tongue around just like in that movie with the ""adrenochrome"". I really liked Depp though throughout, and I liked his interaction with Chris Lee, one of my favorite actors.<br/><br/>The only part I didn't really like as much as the first film was the oompah loompah songs. They were interesting, but not very original. One of them was really blatantly similar to the music of ""Queen"". Another one was very ""Bollywood"". Maybe they'll grow on me over time, but at this point I don't like them as much as just the simple song in the first version.<br/><br/>All in all, a worthy re-imagining of the children's classic. Burton's ""Planet of the Apes"" was a disaster, but this one is good. Not as good as ""Big Fish"", but it's good."
"Smells_Like_Cheese","8","3","4","18 July 2005"," Charlie and the Chocolate Factory delivers a delicious bite!
","As usual, the original is better. BUT!!! This is Tim Burton's version, and it is a completely different version from a light and chipper story to a little bit more dark. Everything on this movie has Tim Burton's name on it. His classic trade marks and actors are in this film. While I'd rather show anyone the first and original Willy Wonka, this one isn't even half bad. As an updated and closer to the book film, this movie delivers everything you could want. It's interesting, funny, creepy, dramatic, and loving. It's a charming movie and so far one of the best for the year of 2005 that I've seen. I'm very impressed, Tim Burton.<br/><br/>8/10"
"queensamika","Null","3","4","15 July 2005"," IT ROCKED. (spoilers)
","Anyone who is undoubtedly a what I have dubbed ""culty"" (an individual often fan of certain offbeat films, pieces of music, or works of art) will knock-down drag-out LOVE this movie. And I imagine that even normal people will too. Here's why...<br/><br/>Kids will love it number one. It's got just the right kind of humor, just the right bit of fantasy, just the right bit of sweetness (pun intended), and a dash of downright creepiness that cooks up to be the perfect movie for kids around ages 7-13 or so. BUT THERE'S SO MUCH MORE TO THIS MOVIE THAN THAT. If you're a Tim Burton fan, you're going to flip when you see this thing. I really can't put it any plainer. YOU WILL FREAK! Consider this Burton's masterpiece, and dare I say it, but I think it just might earn him an Ocsar nomination for BD, and could possibly earn Depp the one he missed for Pirates of the Caribbean. What floored me more than anything, and quite literally gave me the chills as I sat there watching, were the GENIUS references to other classic works of art in pop culture: 2001: A Space Odyssey throughout the Mike TV scene, and the Oompa Loompa songs newly fashioned to pay homage to iconic bands: The Beatles for Varuca Salt's scene, KISS and Queen for Mike TV's. Burton has outdone himself. This movie strikes a nerve on so many levels, not to mention the one Johnny Depp takes Wilder's original performance to. <br/><br/>Truly, if you were worried they'd flub it up, relax. Take a deep breath. They did it PERFECTLY, and even better than you imagined they could. Ocars '06 pleads GOD!!! <br/><br/>Am I alone in this?"
"pigpensgrave05","1","12","25","17 July 2005"," I thought the movie was shameful
","I regret going to this film, more so than when I went to see Spice World when I was 10. Shame! Shame on you Johnny Depp! Your face is on Hostess cupcakes now, and my dreams are ruined. Shame on you Tim Burton! I don't know what to say...man hath not created anything lamer, and I'm sure God sorely regrets having ever created man because of this. This is not blind criticism. Compare this to all the wonderful things Hollywood produced back in the day. Sunset Boulevard, 8 1/2, my God, Battleship Potemkin. And don't tell me about escapism, Fred Astaire and Ginger Rodgers' mindless fluff had more wit than this. Escapism is not supposed to embarrass you, and this movie made me flush. Johnny Depp acted like an idiot. None of the kids had any personality or acting talent, the grown ups were cardboard, and the oompa loompas were one guy digitally made smaller (death to all things digital) and multiplied. Oh, and one had a baritone voice, how funny is that? How funny are inside Hollywood references and pop references? It is so embedded in the idiotic current ideology (parodies of pop culture, bad humor, political correctness up the ass), that it turns bland and one forgets it the next day. Who is going to remember this 20 years from now? No one. As far as all new movies go I am taking on a strictly Holden Caufield attitude. They are crummy. They suck. I hate it. I'm moving to Rwanda with a VCR and taped TCM tapes. And Tim Burton should be made to visit R.D.'s grave and place a letter of apologies on it."
"areatw","8","4","6","9 September 2017"," Perfectly captures the magic of the book
","I might be in a tiny minority here, but I actually prefer 2005's 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory' to the original 'Willy Wonka' film from the 70s. Yes, the original is considered a classic and rightly so, but there is something about this version that I love that just isn't found in the original. It remains loyal to the book whilst adding the odd new element to give it a fresh feel.<br/><br/>I've seen this version a few times now and always enjoy it immensely. I particularly like how we learn more about the mysterious Willy Wonka character as we're taken back to his childhood. Johnny Depp is brilliant as Wonka, delivering a truly captivating performance and giving his own take on the character. 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory' turned out as well as it could have for me. It was never going to please everyone, but I think this is a brilliant remake."
"frankjones-84156","1","4","6","17 April 2017"," Tim Burton's WORST
","I've seen a number of Tim Burton movies, but this one was BY FAR the worst. Doesn't even relate to what happened in the book or the previous movie with Gene Wilder. Did Wonka have flashbacks of his childhood? No. Did he even talk to or about his father? No. Or were there any more ridiculous stories Charlie was told about? No. What a ridiculous movie! When I heard that Tim Burton was going to make this movie, I just knew it was going to fail miserably."
"slightlymad22","8","4","6","17 September 2014"," Burton And Depp Do It Again
","Reteaming for their fifth collaboration in 15 years. Tim Burton directs Johnny Depp in Charlie & The Chocolate Factory. I don't understand all the have this movie gets. I for one found it as enjoyable as the 1971 version. It's very silly, but visually stunning and I enjoyed a hell lot of it.<br/><br/>I can't praise the cast enough of this movie enough here. AnnaSophia Robb as Violet Beauregarde, Julia Winter as Veruca Salt, Jordan Fry as Mike Teavee, and the boy with the funniest line In the movie Philip Wiegratz as Augustus Gloop (His delivery of said line is hilarious.) are all splendidly horrid. Then there is Freddie Highmore as Charlie Bucket. I love this kid, I think he is superb in everything I have seen him in, (check out Finding Neverland and August Rush) Burton does a great job getting great performances from his child actors. <br/><br/>As for the adult cast David Kelly as Grandpa Joe is a delight, Helena Bonham Carter (in her first of five pairings with Depp) as Mrs. Bucket is surprisingly less cooky than one would imagine, and it's a true case of less is more. Noah Taylor is fine as Mr. Bucket. Missi Pyle is fun as the ambitious glory driven pushy mother Mrs. Beauregarde. Christopher Lee has a small role as Dr. Wilbur Wonka and Deep Roy is great as every Oompa- Loompa. Then there is Johnny Depp as Willy Wonka. <br/><br/>Back when this was made Depp was one of my top 10 actors, but sadly there is something missing in his work since this time (with the exception of Sweeney Todd) as he seems to be lost in big budget sequels to the 'Pirates Of The Caribbean' and underwhelming movies. I was bored all the way through 'The Tourist' but I at least stayed awake. I fell asleep during 'The Rum Diary' and 'Public Enemies' (his best movie since Sweeney Todd) was a missed opportunity, Although I liked Depp's performance. There is an energy around Depp (that unless he is working with Burton) has been missing in most of his work between then and now.<br/><br/>The film's heart comes from Highmore, a gifted young performer whose performance is very sincere, honest and unforced in a way that's rare in a child actor. Johnny Depp was so impressed with Highmore's performance when they co started in 'Finding Neverland' that he recommended that Tim Burton hire him for the role of Charlie Bucket."
"joker-scar","1","4","6","2 February 2011"," a dull ride through a great story
","I grew watching the original and have fond memories of it. I re-watched the original 1971 version a few years ago and the found it did not hold up in regards to the production value and photography clichés that were prevalent back in the late 60's and early 70's. Like so many things, memories are better left in the mind than the reality that exists on film. Having said that...I must say that the production value on the 2005 remake is better...but not much else. The dramatic story elements flat line in this remake. The moment where Charlie finds his Golden Ticket is so anti-climatic compared to the 1971 version that I jumped back on the DVD to see if I blinked and missed the moment. The sub-plot of the five children being approached by Wonka's competitor and bribing them to steal the Chocolate masters secrets is not there at all and it is sorely missed from the original. The elimination of the four other children, due to their character's short comings, is not as pronounced as in the original version. The main character, Charlie, is not ""tested"" on his morals, like in the 71' version, except on one moment near the end of the film, except he does not change and become a hero, he just stays the same throughout which is boring, dramatically speaking. Then we come to Johnny Depps interpretation of the Willy Wonka character...Depp, always a fine actor in any genre, this time stumbles along in a weird, wimpy and effeminate Child-man version of Wonka that leaves this viewer wondering ""why"". I realize that any actor worth his salt as Depp is, would not tread on the same ground as another actor and simply mimic his performance, but to go 180 degrees the other way was not a wise choice. Gene Wilders ""Wonka"" was dark, funny and wise, leading his five prospective heirs on a moral journey through self while Depp's ""Wonka"" finds himself on a Oompa Loompa psychotherapist sofa pondering the scars of his childhood. I am a huge fan of Christopher Lee but seeing him in the clunky flashbacks of Wonkas childhood took me out of the film every time. All in all a very dull movie with no danger or tension at any turn. I'll stick to the corny 1971 production values that had strong performances and dramatic tension in the storyline and a much more satisfying ending."
"Electrified_Voltage","8","4","6","29 April 2010"," Johnny Depp can't hold a candle to Gene Wilder as Willy Wonka, but this is still a good second adaptation of the book
","In 2005, I heard about this then-new version of Roald Dahl's ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" and how Johnny Depp played Willy Wonka in it. It had been years since I had last read to book and seen the original 1971 adaptation, ""Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory"", but I still remembered the story very well and went to see this second big screen adaptation in the theatre. I was impressed at the time and still was months later when I saw it again on DVD. Earlier this month, I watched the 1971 film for the first time probably since the late 1990s, and thought it was an overall excellent family film. Over a week later, I watched this Tim Burton version again for the first time in several years, and thought it slightly inferior but still very good.<br/><br/>Charlie Bucket is a young boy in a poor family, which consists of him, his two parents, and his four bedridden grandparents. His father can barely support the family by working in a toothpaste factory. Near their run-down home is a chocolate factory, run by a reclusive man named Willy Wonka, whom Charlie's Grandpa Joe used to work for. Nobody knows who currently works there, as nobody is ever seen entering or exiting the building, but world renowned candy keeps coming out of it! When it is announced that Wonka has put golden tickets into five different candy bar wrappers, which could be found anywhere in the world, and the five recipients will get a tour of his factory, chaos begins! The first four tickets are acquired by four mean-spirited kids, and since Charlie's family can hardly ever afford chocolate, it's highly unlikely that he will get one. However, after he finds money left out in the snow, he goes to buy a Wonka bar with it, and finds the fifth and final golden ticket inside! He gets to go on the tour, and takes Grandpa Joe along, but they are in for some surprises! <br/><br/>One of the major differences between the two movie adaptations is Johnny Depp's portrayal of Willy Wonka here. It was apparently inspired by several famous children's TV hosts, and this version of the character is not one of the stronger aspects of the film, and not one of Depp's strongest performances. It cannot compare with Gene Wilder's portrayal, though it isn't exactly bad, and the character can be pretty funny at times here. Despite that one flawed performance, the cast of this 2005 version is mostly very strong. In the role of Charlie, Freddie Highmore is just as good here as Peter Ostrum is in the 1971 film. They also got talented cast members to play Charlie's family members, including David Kelly as Grandpa Joe and another common Tim Burton recast (like Depp), Helena Bonham Carter as Mrs. Bucket. Most of the cast performances are impressive, another example being Deep Roy digitally multiplied as the Oompa Loompas, who sing songs, play musical instruments, and parody various rock bands! I just didn't care much for Missi Pyle as Mrs. Beauregarde. This film has the usual dark and amazing Tim Burton visuals, and like the 1971 version, great sets were made for Willy Wonka's factory! For the most part, the story is very entertaining as well, even if the ending could have been a bit better thought out.<br/><br/>Some say it's best not to compare the two silver screen adaptations of Roald Dahl's classic children's book, but since I've watched this one again shortly after revisiting the original after so many years, it's kind of hard for me not to. 2005's ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" is unsurprisingly weaker than 1971's ""Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory"", and I know many fans of the first adaptation have shown great disdain for this remake, but personally, I think both of them are highly entertaining family movies, though I can understand how Johnny Depp's portrayal of the reclusive factory owner could put many viewers off. This Tim Burton film does take some liberties with the story, and I would be giving away too much if I mentioned many of them, though it also features aspects of the book not included in the 1971 version, such as Mr. Bucket being alive and working in a toothpaste factory and Grandpa Joe telling his grandson about chocolate palace in India, not that I'm saying any of this is good or bad. If you're a fan of the book, both adaptations could be a lot of fun to watch."

I recently watched it again about 2 months ago and I must say, I have never been more impressed. No other director could have done it better than Tim. All his movies are amazing but this is the best by far. This movie is more like the book than the original and might I add that unlike most people I really cannot stand the original and I though Gene Wilder didn't do a good job at all. Willy Wonka in this film is the most interesting character ever, probably because his personality is so similar to mine. I love the choice of costume for him and I'm even going to my semi-formal as him. All the songs through out the movie were very well done and I loved the fact that Roald Dahl's lyrics were used. The song at the start (Main Titles) was the best song composed for a film that I've ever heard. A big well done to Danny Elfman. I thought all of the cast fitted their character perfectly. Deep Roy did an excellent job and I liked the fact that he played all of the oompa loompas. I really can't explain how much I loved this movie and how much it had effected my life because to be honest I am absolutely obsessed."
"lil_baka_neko","9","4","6","20 September 2007"," CatCF better than WWatCF
","I really thought the newer movie outdid the old one by far. After reading the book, Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory fell way short. It did not stick to the book at all... except the fact that there was a factory and he won. Sure there were characters singing and dancing, but that wasn't a part of the book nor should it have been part of the movie.<br/><br/>There was no real bad guy in the book, just the competitors in the beginning as mentioned in Charlie and the Chocolate factory. The new movie goes almost exactly to the book, it even has the same LYRICS as in the books for the Oompa Loompa's to sing.<br/><br/>I also think that Johnny Depp preformed VERY well as Willy Wonka. In the book he is like a child. Although somewhat sadistic and slightly insane. There was added parts, such as the flashbacks but that help to improve the story more than take away from it. Over all I think it was a wonderful film far surpassing the old one."
"TxMike","Null","4","6","14 January 2006"," I found it to be good entertainment.
","Not having seen the earlier ""Chocolate Factory"" movie(s?) I of necessity took this one for its own merits. Done in a completely whimsical style, I found it to be good entertainment. I like Johnny Depp and the characters he creates. Here he is Willy Wonka, a grown man, reasonably old, but living in one big candy fantasy, mostly chocolate candy. After years of extreme secrecy about his giant candy factory, he mysteriously decides to allow 5 lucky children (and their chosen adults) to spend a whole day at the factory, showing them all the inner workings. Worldwide, 5 giant chocolate bars each have a golden foil ticket for the day.<br/><br/>Young Freddie Highmore is good as Charlie Bucket, living in a slightly slanted and breezy shack with his mum and dad, plus both sets of grandparents, within sight of the Wonka factory. They are so poor he gets to buy only one Wonka bar a year, on his birthday. But Charlie luckily gets to be one of the 5 kids, accompanied by his Grandpa Joe (David Kelly)<br/><br/>Once inside the 5 kids begin the tour but know they are in a competition of sorts, at the end of the day one of them will be given a prize beyond their wildest dreams. We see the usual whimsical treatment of chocolate factory workings but, only when Willy opens a small door do we see the real inner workings of the chocolate factory.<br/><br/>SPOILERS FOLLOW. Opening the little door reveals a brightly colored fairyland of rivers of warm chocolate and chocolate falls, candy growing on trees, all tended by workers that Charlie had found years earlier in a distant forest. They are miniature people about 2 or 3 feet tall, called the Oompa Loompa. All dozens of them are played by the same actor, small person Deep Roy, through the magic of special effects. The Oompa Loompa love chocolate and work in his factory to make all the chocolate. Trained squirrels crack and clean the nuts. <br/><br/>The other 4 kids are all rotten and selfish in different ways, each drops out of the tour as a result of misbehavior. This leaves Charlie to win the prize which was ... to be given the chocolate factory because Willy realized that he will need an heir. But Charlie refuses when it is clear that he would have to leave his family to do so. That is the ""moral"" of this movie, family and good behavior are more important than worldly things. In the end all are happy as Willy moves the little shack and all family members inside the factory.<br/><br/>(The young Robb actress was one to the kids. She was the girl with the dog in 'Because of Winn Dixie.')"

"bowieholic1986","10","4","6","20 September 2005"," Fantastic adaptation of a classic story
","First of all, let me congratulate Mr. Burton, Mr. Depp, Mr. Elfman, and the rest of the cast and crew of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, on making such an excellent film. I've seen this film four times. I was blown away the first time I saw it, and consequently the three times after that as well. Let me just say that I am huge fan of 1971's Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, starring Gene Wilder as the eccentric chocolatier. I was a bit skeptical at first about seeing this new adaptation of the classic Dahl story. I have one word to say. Wow. *takes a deep breath and prepares to explain* Both films are amazing in their own ways...<br/><br/>Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory---------------------------------- Although the screenplay for Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory was written by Roald Dahl himself, it deviates from the original story quite a bit. For example: The part where Veruca Salt gets her comeuppance in the room with the geese laying golden eggs was, in the book, a room of trained squirrels shelling nuts. As for the musical quality of the film... personally, I think all but Pure Imagination and the Oompa Loompa songs should have been cut. All they do is detract from the magical quality of the film. And while the Oompa Loompas are a bit frightening (They look like demonic carrots with toothpaste eyebrows), they still achieve the level of important ambiance the Oompa Loompas had in the book. As for the Five Children... I prefer Mike, Veruca, and Violet from this film. For me, their performances were much better than their 2005 counterparts. Veruca was so much more vile and nasty, Mike.. well.. I really never pictured him as the computer-whiz knowitall that he is in ""Charlie"", and Violet was dead-on with her personality in the book, rather than the new, uber-achieving scary kid. Augustus and Charlie.. What is there to say? For starters, their performances were lack-luster at best. Augustus had very few lines, and Charlie was way too whiny. This is still the classic Willy Wonka film, even if it does look rather outdated. Wilder's Wonka was a quirky, lovable, hug-me Wonka with flyaway hair and mischievous eyes. I love Wilder's Wonka, and always will.<br/><br/>Charlie and the Chocolate Factory-------------------------------------- Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, in my opinion, is a superior film to it's 1971 counterpart. Burton, Depp, and Elfman once again team up to give us an extraordinary film, not unlike Edward Scissorhands. I have just finished reading the book, as have this to say: John August, who wrote the screenplay, adapted Dahl's novel with the utmost attention to the story, and to the personalities of it's main characters, Willy Wonka and Charlie Bucket. This film is so much more true to the book, down to most of Wonka's lines, and the color of his jacket. Wonka's costume was one of the highlights of the film, because it's so freakin' cool. Danny Elfman's score for this film is the best he's ever done, culminating in the Main Titles and End Credits. Throughout the film, Elfman's score lifts the world of Willy Wonka and his amazing factory into a magical realm of excitement and intrigue. The Main Titles are driving and eerie, creepy at times, which only adds to the wonderfulness of it all. This film made me a big Elfman fan. Burton.. what can I say that could possibly state anything but the obvious? He's a genius, a brilliant filmmaker and visionary. Anything he touches turns to gold. Mel Stuart, who directed the 1971 film, did a great job directing it, but it lacks something, leaves something to be desired. The Oompa Loompas are much better in this film, played all by Deep Roy, who I recognized from the 8th season of 'The X-Files'. The Oompas are about the size as described in the book this time, coming to just about the knees of the adults, which lends them even more of an other-worldly quality. And they don't look like demonic carrots. I've already shared my opinions on Veruca, Violet, and Mike. As for the new Augustus and Charlie: Augustus was a much better character in this film, and he actually said stuff! He was much more humorous, as well. Charlie.. well, let me say that little Freddie Highmore is an amazing actor. He outshines Peter Ostrum as Charlie Bucket by a thousand-fold (and his performance in Finding Neverland is something I'll never forget). And as for Willy Wonka... Come on, man! This is Johnny Depp! Who better to play such a creepy, utterly awesome and strangely attractive Willy Wonka who's smile is flawless and he looks like he's been dipping into the nitrous oxide? I love Depp's Wonka as much as I love Wilder's. Johnny Depp is.. well, how can I describe one of THE BEST actors ever to come out of Hollywood, and possibly hope to do him justice? Johnny Depp is Johnny Depp. Accept no substitutes."
"kidfromaus","10","4","6","10 September 2005"," An excellent movie definitely worth seeing!
","'Charlie and the chocolate factory' is a great movie that is almost completely different from the original 'Willie Wonka and the chocolate factory' movie. It is about a poor boy named Charlie Bucket who finds one of Willie Wonka's five golden tickets and is given the once in a lifetime opportunity to tour the marvelous chocolate factory. Each of the four other children are one by one faced with a terrible fate for being very rotten and not worthy of earning the grand prize set for the child who is the last remaining contender. Now this may sound similar to the previous movie but you will find that the factory is highly different and some of the less interesting ideas have been cut from the new movie. A lot of new features have also been added including the new and improved Oompa Loompa's who just so happen to be excellent singers. This movie is much better as it goes into a great amount of detail about Willie Wonka as a child and also how the factory came to be. The old movie leaves a lot of questions unanswered and many loose ends but this movie finishes nicely by Willie Wonka being reunited with his long lost dad and Charlie and his family actually movie into to the factory where Charlie and Willie become business partners of such. This movie also shows the other four children and their parents leaving the factory in a different state to when they came in. Overall, this movie was excellent and is suitable for all ages. One of the best movies i have ever seen!"
"disintegration_88","10","4","6","9 September 2005"," the best movies of all time
","This movie came out in Australia only just over a week ago, I am a big Tim Burton fan and like all his movies. So I was looking forward to it since I heard that he was making an adaption of Charlie. So I went to see it first day and was very excited when the screen lit up. In the first 10 minutes my face was stuck facing the screen, it was amazing! The sets, acting, unique characters everything was good. Johnny Depp hadn't even come in yet! I was worried that Tim Burton would go too far with this movie and would lose his style. I was so wrong! Most people my age hated this movie but it was the best movie of all time! And then the chocolate factory scenes came in and my head was even more frozen in position of the screen. Johnny Depp has always been one of my favorite actors. His performance in this movie is incredible, he is so different to other actors and so much better. So I strongly urge everybody to see this movie."
"timwk","8","4","6","7 September 2005"," A remake unlike no other...
","Sorry to all those Johnny Depp fans out there but I went into this film with a lot of expectations and was concerned greatly whether he could carry off the role of Willy Wonka. I have never been a fan of his however I was very much impressed. What a show it was! He did an interview with one of our late shows here (Equivelant in USA to your David Letterman etc.) over satellite and said that as soon as he got the part to the movie he stopped watching the original with his kids. He wanted a fresh new approach to the character of Willy Wonka, and that, he DID! He came off eccentric and clever. I did feel however some of the dialogue that was used from the original film was not well brought across to the new screen. It was satisfactory however still entertaining and humorous. I am like many of the fans out of there of the original film. Nothing will beat the original. I also believe this film is more true to the original book. Not ever reading the book I cannot comment on this.<br/><br/>The sets were colourful to be expected with some new scenes. However those expecting to see Charlie and his Grandfather floating to the ceiling in the bubble scene will be disappointed. In this movie, Charlie is always the good boy placing his family first.<br/><br/>What can i say about this film. Well i loved it. Since i am now father to a 5 year old son, I have watched the original over and over again now as an adult. It brings me back being a child again. I escape in the magic of it all. The new film was no exception to the rule. I know remakes have been very fashionable in the last 5-10 years and original ideas are becoming more rare every day, this is one remake you WILL want to go and see.<br/><br/>Johnny, you did well. I loved the casting of the old Grandfather. Anyone remember Waking Ned Divine??? I believe it was the same guy.<br/><br/>Go see it. Whether you are a parent or not or with children or not you will enjoy it. A MUST SEE!!!"
"totally-addicted-to-bass","10","4","6","2 September 2005"," Brilliant and a total feel-good movie
","Personally, i thought this film was absolutely amazing and its now one of my favourites. The story is of a young poor boy who adores the amazing chocolate of Willy Wonka but only gets one bar a year. Willy Wonka (Johnny Depp) announces that 5 golden tickets have been put in chocolate bars and shipped all over the world. There's a rush as shops are selling out of Wonka bars amazingly fast and children all over the world are buying millions of them. When there's only one ticket left, Charlie finds some money and buys a bar, inside is a gleaming golden ticket! His whole family are thrilled. And thats only the beginning of the movie. <br/><br/>Eccentric Willy Wonka is a lovable character that will make you laugh and Johnny Depp plays it so well he is amazing. <br/><br/>I won't continue with the story so that those who wish to see this film and have not read the book will get to see for themselves what happens.<br/><br/>This is a film that you can watch over and over again without getting bored. Its also a film that will make you laugh and satisfy you with a good story. Its amazing and will make you feel all warm inside.<br/><br/>The original film was good but Johnny Depp is just so much more than Gene Wilder can ever hope to be (from my point of view). In the original, you don't feel any connection with Charlie where as in the updated version you cant help but love him, same with wonka himself. <br/><br/>I love this film and i hope all of you do too, its amazing I've already seen it twice but would love to see it again."
"pernille-9","10","4","6","31 August 2005"," Amazing
","Well there is not much to say. If Johnny Depp does not get an Oscar now they don't need to keep giving them. He is amazing. The movie was really funny and it matters not that it is made for children. I loved it. <br/><br/>Willy Wonker is played perfectly by Johnny Depp and he alone would be worth watching the move for. But there are many other brilliant people joining him. We saw him as the little serious Peter in Finding Neverland but here as Charlie he is truly great. I hope we get to see more of the two of them together. But not in a Charlie and the chocolate factory 2. That would ruin the gem the movie is on its own. <br/><br/>Grandpa is also a gem. One time I did find myself thinking: OK that is not funny. But I guess there has to be times where kids laugh as well as times where adults do."
"D_la","8","4","6","23 August 2005"," Chocolate-inspired fun
","With this film you constantly hear people comparing it to the previous film version starring Gene Wilder. Well not here, because although I think I've seen it at some stage, I don't really remember it all that well. So obviously it didn't make a great impression on me.<br/><br/>For the few who don't know this is based on the book of the same title by Roald Dahl. The plot is centered on the chocolate factory of the title, its owner (Willy Wonka) and Charlie Bucket. Charlie, played by Freddie Highmore from Finding Neverland, comes from a family so poor that all they seem to eat is cabbage soup. His four grandparents share the one bed, and never leave it. Every year for his birthday Charlie gets a bar of chocolate, the only one he'll have all year. He always gets a bar of Wonka's chocolate and loves the stories his grandpa Joe tells about the factory, and its mysterious owner Willy Wonka.<br/><br/>When a competition to allow five children to enter the factory is announced the chances are slim that Charlie will get a golden ticket<br/><br/>Now my memory might be faulty here, but wasn't Charlie supposed to be English? So why did he find a dollar bill? Why does he use the term candy? But those are just minor quibbles. All in all I really enjoyed this film. Depp's Wonka is wonderfully weird and, well, just plain wacky. His disdain for the children is perfect for the film, as are the Oompa Loompa's crazy routines. Certain reviews have compared Depp's Wonka to Michael Jackson, but I have to say I don't see the similarities. Yes both are unnaturally white, but Wonka is not interested in the children at all, he doesn't care about them, all he cares about is chocolate and sweets and inventing.<br/><br/>From the outset it is obvious that this is a Burton film, there are all those weird but great visuals, not to mention Depp's take on Willy Wonka. Although I did think that the music wasn't especially Burtonesque, and in most places didn't really stand out. Having said that I did enjoy the Oompa Loompa's songs.<br/><br/>The children are all well-cast, Highmore especially is perfect as the scrawny underfed Charlie. But my favourite was the spoiled-rotten ""Veruca Salt, the little brute, Has just gone down the garbage chute""."
"mychelle","8","4","6","21 August 2005"," Charlie and Chocolate Factory
","We took our 6 year old son to see this movie. It is a magical tale about 5 lucky winners of a golden ticket. Charlie Bucket is one of the lucky winners. Charlie finds his ticket and struggles briefly with a decision to keep it or sell it, and is given some beautiful words of wisdom from someone he loves. At first I felt some of the images might be a bit disturbing for my son, but he loved the movie and wants to go again. Depp is superb as Willy Wonka, and reveals just enough mystery about his own past to keep you on the edge of your seat as he mesmerizes the ticket winners (and the children in the audience)with the wonders of the factory. I left the theatre with a smile -- wondering who really won the grand prize ..."
"ebickell","8","4","6","20 August 2005"," Like the book.... bizarre and good!
","I read Roald Dahl's books over and over as a child (and still return to them once in a while as an adult). I love his writing. I was worried that the movie would be a departure from the classically weird British humour of the book, but Burton did a great job! Depp was perfectly strange as Wonka; in fact, the whole movie was incredibly well cast! The sets were stunning (I read that the 'chocolate river' was really made of a toothpaste base with bean paste thickener - ugh)and the oompa-loompas.... added a whole other element of weirdness. This is a very appealing film, visually. I loved it.<br/><br/>Now if only someone would make a movie of Dahl's The Witches...!"
"cassie-champ","10","4","6","18 August 2005"," Great film far succeeds the first...
","For those of you who have written bad comments about this movie, i'm not going to have a go at you, but i suggest you go back and watch it again, because you obviously fell asleep after the adverts at the beginning, because it's absolutely FAB!!!!! I have read the book and seen the original since watching the movie and have compared the two, (I'm sad like that). The second movie sticks more to the book than the 1917 version. But also adding in it's own bit here and there just to give the movie a bit of a lift and to make it more their own...<br/><br/>I've always admired Tim Burton's work and i love 'Nightmare Before Christmas.' But Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is by far his best film yet. And having Johnny Depp play Willy Wonker is fantastic, they've done so much work on Johnny Depp that he looks nothing like he's usual self.<br/><br/>I found it a bit rude that people have started calling it 'Willy Wonker and the Chocolate Factory,' but by the way the movie is done it dose seem that thats the idea. They've added flash backs and everything to enhance Willy Wonkers roll, and less about Charlie and his life etc... Also another down side was when the children and parents first meet Willy Wonker. In the book he comes out and dose cart-weeks and stuff, which sound really amazing for an old man to be doing. But Tim Burtons added his own little warped bit and made a little scene where something catches on fire, (like in most of his movies). But it still looks cool.<br/><br/>My favourite part of the film is where Willy Wonker tells Mike off for 'muttering,' it's soooo funny! I've got a big poster of Willy Wonker on my wall. This film wont be forgotten for a long while.<br/><br/>(Producers, If and when are you going to make a film of 'The Great Glass Elevator,' The sequel to 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory?'"
"dasNdanger","10","4","6","18 August 2005"," Depp doesn't meet expectations...thank goodness.
","I loved CATCF - but admittedly - it wasn't at the top of my favorite Depp films upon first viewing. After I left the theater on opening night, I wasn't quite sure what to make of Depp's performance. NOT because I saw 'Michael Jackson'...THAT freaky image never popped into my head, thank goodness...but - in all honesty - because I was expecting 'Jack Sparrow', especially considering the target audience. Although a Depp 'career supporter' for nearly 18 years now, I expected him to do what the likes of Tom Cruise, or Brad Pitt, or so many other actors do today: Give the exact same performance as in the last movie. I SHOULD have known better, seeing Depp go through his chameleonic changes film after film, character after character. But THIS time I expected him - for some ungodly reason - to try to capitalize on his newly acquired fame by sticking with 'Jack Sparrow's' formula for success. But, thank goodness, he didn't. Instead he spun the audience around and baffled them with what seems to be an awkward performance, leaving them shaking their judgmental heads. However, the problem was not with Depp's acting, but in expectations. Why DID we expect Depp to repeat any of his critically acclaimed performances of the past...why did we even expect him to TRY to appeal to the masses? This is a man who would rather hide under a rock (or funny hats, glasses, ponchos, floppy hair, etc...) then be praised for his 'appeal' as an actor. <br/><br/>So I went back to see CATCF again...and again...and WOW!! How refreshing to see something completely different on the screen!! Depp DIDN'T make it easy, this is a 'thinking man's' performance...and you're either going to accept what you see on the surface, or you're going to look a bit deeper. I looked deeper, and I have come to the conclusion that Wonka alone stands out as Depp's most complex character to date. This character is complicated - childlike, but sinister; confident, but insecure; a genius, but an idiot - he's the Ultimate Paradox...and we don't know whether to laugh with him, or at him, or to even laugh at all. Well...I am now doing all three, and doing so in earnest...but perhaps not the way you would think. Wonka's awkwardness breaks my heart, his cunning glances and sinister smirks make me *squeeee!* with delight, and his lame-o jokes make me roar with laughter, as if I'm in on some weird inside joke. This is a brilliant performance and shouldn't be written off too soon as 'less than stellar'. I think time will prove that even as a dysfunctional, giggling chocolatier, Depp is a true wizard at what he does and, perhaps, the last true visionary standing in Hollywood today."
"CSM126-1","10","4","6","17 August 2005"," Bitter. Dark. Perfect.
","Were it a chocolate bar, Tim Burton's ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" would be dark and bitter. Just the way I like it. Staying closer to the source material than the 1971 version did, ""Charlie"" gives Roald Dahl fans reason to rejoice. No longer is Willy Wonka the sunny, cheery twit that Gene Wilder crafted. In the hands of Johnny Depp, Wonka is a twisted, depraved, and sadistic man. He takes great pleasure in the thought of putting spoiled children through pain and suffering, and he doesn't mind admitting that he hates grown-ups of all stripes. This is how Wonka should be.<br/><br/>Another improvement over the original is the Oompa Loompas. Their original back story, not told in the first film, is told here. Also they sing the songs from the book, not that garbage from the first film. The musical numbers are inspired, ranging from Bollywood musical to rock and roll to pop ballad. Deep Roy, who plays every Oompa Loompa, does a fantastic job of giving the characters life and making them a little scary even if they are only one foot tall.<br/><br/>We also have Tim Burton's stunning vision to bring the quirky tale to life. The factory is a candy-colored den of nightmares with boiling hot rivers of chocolate and torturous uses for seemingly benign candy making machinery. But the interesting thing is that Burton makes the factory as pathetic as it is menacing. Willy's mechanical greeters at the gate explode and his pipes burst and the very mention of the word ""parents"" brings everything to a screeching halt.<br/><br/>Willy, as it turns out, had a dentist for a father, and thusly never knew the joy of candy until he ran away. And when he tried to return home, Willy found that his father had left and taken the house with him. So Willy locked himself away inside his factory, where he developed a complexion so pale that he actually seems to absorb light like a black hole. He retains the maturity of an infant and the mentality of a candy-addicted twelve-year-old, making him a societal pariah even though everyone adores his confections.<br/><br/>No, Willy Wonka is not a pleasant character. He's not meant to be. He's meant to be a depraved freak who learns to grow up with the help of the world's most mature little boy, Charlie Bucket. Freddie Highmore is incredible as Charlie. He gives the character so much emotional weight that he easily blows the previous incarnation of Charlie right out of the water. Depp hand-picked Highmore for the role, and it's obvious why. Highmore shows the potential to be as talented an actor as Depp, with just as glorious a career.<br/><br/>""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" is a film that will put a smile on the face of older fans of the book, and nightmares inside the minds of young newcomers. And that's how Roald Dahl would want it. The story may be bitter and dark, but it will leave a good taste in your mouth. This is one of the year's finest and perhaps Tim Burton's best.<br/><br/>PS: Some folks might say Depp fashioned Wonka after Michael Jackson. I say Jackson fashioned himself after Wonka. Either way, they're both kind of sad."
"jpschapira","8","4","6","16 August 2005"," ""Let's Boogie!""
","I was talking to my mother the other day, telling her how I loved to see Johnny Depp on film. I was thinking about the excitement I get when I'm going to see one of his pictures. Anyway, besides Depp's presence there were plenty of elements that made this an expecting ride for me. Roal Dahl's ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" is still (or I like to think so) my favorite book. I often remember some parts and I haven't read t many times but the first time I did I couldn't believe my eyes. Charlie Bucket; that extremely lovable character, and even more lovable in the skin of the talented Freddie Highmore.<br/><br/>I could neither believe my eyes once Depp's Willy Wonka opened that little (well, not that little) door and I was driven to that fantastic production design, colors and environment that I'm getting convinced I'll only see again in a Tim Burton film (even in an old one). With Alex McDowell at the top of the production design team, Burton made sure everything look beautiful, and it did. With ""Big Fish"" a couple of years ago, I was amazed, but it was actually long ago, probably in 1990, when I discovered he was a genius. In ""Edward Scissorhands"", in that unique world...<br/><br/>Which takes me to Johnny Depp, another genius. Maybe that's the main reason why he and Burton work so well together: all the things they have in common. A friend of my brother and a friend of mine told me some weeks ago that Johnny Depp was gay. Gay because he chose to play gay characters and so. ""The pirate, the writer, that investigator was also a little gay..."" I would prefer the word eccentric, or better, another word comparable to Tim Burton; unique. He's been, since ever, choosing characters the rest of the actors wouldn't even dare to get near of.<br/><br/>This and many others are Depp's qualities. When he and Burton get together, we're grateful of watching unique (yes, again) film-making. This is not, however, his best collaboration yet, which in my humble opinion continues to be ""Sleepy Hollow"". It doesn't make a difference anyway, because it is a different movie, with different characters, with an inside sad story about heart and family and a very good piece in the end. It's also a very good performance by Depp. ""The magician"", as I call him, stands out as another completely different being in a memorable composed portrayal of the ever known Willy Wonka. He worked his ideas over the original book before the screenplay was finished; he is that committed. Memorable portrayal, however polemic (for reasons I won't detail); and that could be a disadvantage for the recognition.<br/><br/>I say ever known Willy Wonka because it is ever known by me. I got somehow moved when I saw the glass elevator going up, or the Ompa Loompas working inside the factory; but it will be just as fun for anyone who hasn't read Roal Dahl's beautiful book, because John August (who also wrote Burton's ""Big Fish"") created a screenplay that brings the fable alive, with perfect narrated moments and words each person will understand. This is what I call a movie for the whole family. Don't even mention Danny Elfman's score, with the beautiful songs (he also sang them!...with machines and effects of course).<br/><br/>And last but not least, two, if not three supporting performances for the times. David Kelly, splendid as Grandpa Joe; Deep Roy, perfect as the funny and adorable Ompa Loompa(s) and if I may say, a deep and moving Christopher Lee as Willy's father, Dr. Wilbur Wonka. In the film's most moving scene, they both meet again, and you wouldn't imagine how the father admires the son, when we are made to believe he wouldn't.<br/><br/>The screen went black and people started cheering, clapping their hands. I hadn't witnessed that since ""Titanic"" in 1997, because there are times when I feel like clapping, but nobody else does, so I have to stay quiet."
"Victor Field","8","4","6","14 August 2005"," This movie melts in your mouth, not in your hand.
","I like chocolate. I like Tim Burton movies. I like the original Roald Dahl book (and its sequel). I even liked ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory,"" but not as much as a lot of others - though still more than Dahl did (he loathed it as much as he liked chocolate). And I like Danny Elfman. ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,"" therefore, is a treat for fans of all of the above.<br/><br/>Burton and screenwriter John August improve not only on their own ""Big Fish"" but also on the previous movie in a number of ways, and not only in terms of effects (with a gap of 34 years it stands to reason that Violet Beauregarde's transformation into a blueberry would beat the original, helped by Annasophia Robb's excellent turn as a superhumanly self-confident little gum-chewer). The movie's addition of a backstory for chocolatier par excellence Willy Wonka (Johnny Depp, turning into another marvellous turn for the master) - like ""Sleepy Hollow,"" he's given a less than happy young life, though at least his dentist dad Christopher Lee doesn't kill his mum with an iron maiden - can seem like an unnecessary addition which weighs the story down and serves as an excuse for a happy family ending (which is a bit strange, given that Dahl's book had one anyway), but it doesn't really harm the finished result, and in fairness you can understand the desire to give Wonka something to do. Something apart from be the unquestioned star of the movie, that is.<br/><br/>Wonka's edge is less prominent here than in Gene ""I was the best Wonka, dammit"" Wilder's performance, but it's here all the same; and if the movie does stack the odds in favour of Charlie Bucket (and that's putting it mildly), so did the book. In any case, Freddie Highmore is so appealing as Charlie that you're rooting for him anyway, and the other child actors are fine as well for the most (oddly, the girls do better than the boys overall - I believe this is called ""Friends Stars In Movies Syndrome"").<br/><br/>The movie is as much a treat for the eyes as the heart, with the chocolate factory seeming like the greatest theme park there ever was and some of the best effects work in a Burton movie (kudos to Cinesite and the Magic Camera Company); Elfman contributes one of his tenderest works for Burton to date, and his songs for the Oompa-Loompas (with Dahl's lyrics from the book) are all without exception highlights.<br/><br/>At the risk of sounding like one of those film critics whose quotes have ""A+"" and exclamation marks a go-go, I can't really deliver a measured examination of this movie - just go and see it. In spite of its pro-chocolate agenda, it's better for kids than ""Madagascar"" and its ilk. And it won't make you feel sick afterwards if you're diabetic. (Believe me, I know.)"
"magichatqueen","10","4","6","13 August 2005"," Hilarious, heartwarming yet poignant
","I have to say this film far surpasses the hideous original, as it gives far more depth to the characters -Willy Wonka in particular- and stays loyal to the actual book. The first film included some completely unnecessary additions like the Gobstopper test and the fizzy lifting drinks. This is a refreshing version which somehow treads the line between dark and light hearted.<br/><br/>The 5 kids are played magnificently; Freddie Highmore's Charlie makes you root for him from the beginning, while the other four are easy to hate as they are incredibly obnoxious. The girl who plays Violet Beauregarde was the best child actor there, while I felt Mike Teavee was overacted. The strange thing is that I think this is closer to Dahl's vision than the original, but Dahl himself actually wrote the screenplay for the first one, which he supposedly hated.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp proves yet again he is a genius at acting by his astounding portrayal of Willy Wonka. Roald Dahl intended him to be a man who never grew up and remains child-like and almost naive, and Depp nails it here. Socially inept, with a loathing of families yet witty and essentially good hearted, the Willy in this film is a complex, dark and lovable character, unlike the wise paternal figure Gene Wilder brought to the role. Flashbacks provide us with a fascinating insight into why Willy became a reclusive sweet maker, because of a troubled relationship with his father. His interaction with the children is hilarious, as he makes it very plain he detests the little brats, yet remains almost courteous with them. He is a very flawed man though, but Charlie helps him redeem himself by reuniting with his dad and becoming part of the Bucket family in a way. I found this film to be poignant at times: the newspaper clippings of his son that Wilbur Wonka has kept, the scene where Charlie turns down the factory because his family mean more to him to name but two moments.<br/><br/>The scenery is breathtaking and brings the factory to life. Although the sight of the Oompa Loompas with Deep Roy's head stuck on all of them was a bit disturbing, the songs are fantastic and the musical score adds a lot to the movie.<br/><br/>This film and Johnny Depp both richly deserve to be given Oscar nominations. many films are capable of touching your heart but this is definitely one of them."

I thought every thing was a lot funnier and cooler than Gene Wilders. I mean I liked that one when i was little. My Aunt and my Uncle liked it. My favorite part was when he had those dolls singing at the very beginning of the entrance!! that was funny but a lot of other things were to!! I mean just the whole thing with Johnny Depp was amazing. I live overseas so i cant really see it right now but it will be coming out in 1 month or so!! i cant wait to see it again!! i hope that if you get to see it then you will like it.

"JediKMan","8","4","6","10 August 2005"," Excellent
","I went into the theaters wondering if I would enjoy this movie or it would leave a lot to ""Pure Imagination"" Tim Burton definitely took a gamble here. He took a great original and decided to mess with it. That's a pretty big risk, but overall I think it paid off. Johnny Depp's amazing ability to play any character in almost any role is truly amazing, and he shows off his skill very will in this film. You will see many references to the original in this film. The main, and most noticeable difference, was Wonka's sarcasm. I found myself laughing at many things that no one else in the theater did, and it was packed out. Perhaps the locals don't appreciate good sarcasm, or maybe I'm just heartless? Either way, I got quite a few good chuckles.<br/><br/>This film also differs from the original considering there are only four songs performed during the movie, compared to the original version, which had nine musical performances. A good comparison to this movie would be the ""Shrek"" series, because it's acceptable for younger children to watch, (and believe me there were plenty there) and it also has plenty of adult humor. By saying adult humor I'm not referring to sexual innuendos or vulgar comments, mostly only sarcastic humor. Wonka's indifference to the children is absolutely hilarious. I do have to say this though, I felt that Wonka and Charlie had a better connection and relationship in this one compared to the original. Near the end of the movie you can see that they begin to bond a great deal, a lot more than the original.<br/><br/>For those that are entering this film expecting a remake of the original, prepare to be astonished. This film is quite original, although as I mentioned there are about half a dozen references to the original. Burton really did a great job of not ruining the classic, while still keeping an ""original"" movie feel."
"themeparkdude","8","4","6","10 August 2005"," Much better than I thought.
","I saw the teaser trailer for this film, and I'm like, ""What the hell is that all about!"" I was looking forward to the film before the teaser, but the teaser put me right off seeing the film. Then about a month later, I saw the trailer. Now this made me think that the film would be a bit better, but it looked like one of these stupid kiddie films that would bore me to bits. Then 2 months later, the rest of my family convinced me to see it. So I was sitting in the cinema, and then the film started. And the most fantastic music started, and I new instantly it was Mr Elfman. Then other things started to amaze me, like amazing effects such as the ""Chocolate Palace"" melting. And then the most amazing Chocolate Factory, and so much more, but then.... the Oompa Loompas showed up. I thought they were very stupid, and the songs they sang were really cheesy.And also the child actors (except Charlie) were not very good. But I realised in this film how good an actor Johnny Depp is. Compare him to his performance in Pirates of the Carrabien, and is such a different character, you wouldn't know it was the same guy! All in all the film was very very good."
"MichaelMargetis","8","4","6","9 August 2005"," ""But that, my dear children, is called cannibalism which is in fact frowned upon in most societies. "" - Willy Wonka
","There's been a lot of buzz about the updated version of Roald Dahl's beloved novel 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory'. Most critics have been raving about it, saying director Tim Burton (Edward Swissorhands, Ed Wood, Big Fish) and actor Johnny Depp (Pirates of the Caribbean, Cry Baby, Finding Neverland) make a wondrous team. Going in to see it I was extremely skeptical and I was kind of expecting not to enjoy the film. First of all, whenever Burton makes a film it's off the freakin' wall, and judging the previews of 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory' I figured it would be strange to the point of just being annoying. The movie trailer made it look creepy and weird just for the sake of being out there, and I had a hard time believing Burton would want to remake such a classic film like 'Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory'. Another reason I had a hard time warming up to this film pre-screening was my feeling that Johnny Depp couldn't compare to the brilliance and style Gene Wilder put into Willy Wonka. Well, when I finally saw 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory' I have to admit I loved it. It's an incredibly imaginative, carefully crafted and beautifully designed motion picture that's a pleasure to watch throughout.<br/><br/>The 2005 version of 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory' follows the book more closely than the 1971 version with Gene Wilder. First of all, the updated Burton version isn't a musical (except for the musical numbers performed by the hilarious Oompa-Loompas.) It follows the poor, kind-hearted Charlie (Freddie Highmore - Finding Neverland) whose perfect in every way. He lives with his parents (Helena Bonham Carter, Noah Taylor) and his grandparents in a little rundown house. Every year for his birthday, Charlie gets a Wonka chocolate bar, and when the inventor of the chocolate Wonka himself (played expertly by Johnny Depp) decides to put five golden tickets in five of his candy bars all over the world, Charlie has to have one. After not getting it the first time or second time, Charlie finally gets a Wonka bar with one of the five coveted golden tickets with the help of his Grandpa Joe (David Kelly). With the golden ticket, Charlie gets an exclusive tour of Willy Wonka's factory along with four other golden ticket winners -- Violet Beauregarde (Annasophia Robb), a goal obsessed sports fanatic; Veruca Salt (Julia Winter), a spoiled rich girl who gets everything she wants; Mike Teavee (Jordan Fry), an aggressive and nasty video game fanatic whose also a genius; and Augustus Gloop (Philip Wiegratz) a morbidly obese greedy German boy whose obsessed with chocolate and in great need of the Atkins diet. Wonka despises all of these kids except for Charlie who will eventually cause Wonka to open his heart and re-introduce him to the concepts of love and family. The film also stars Deep Roy, a little Indian guy who plays all the Oompa Loompas, Missi Pyle, James Foxx, Adam Godrey, Franziska Troegner and Christopher Lee who plays Wonka's evil dentist father who's totally anti-candy.<br/><br/>'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory' is great family fun as well as plenty of laughs and things to enjoy for the more mature crowd. Johnny Depp is fantastic as Wonka because he brings so much energy, style and sheer originality to the character. I refuse to speculate who makes a better Wonka, Depp or Wilder, because they both play him so differently. Freddie Highmore is perfectly cast as the sweet Charlie but he of course gets constantly out-shined by Depp's electrifying Wonka. David Kelly is great as Grandpa Joe, Helena Bonham Carter and Noah Taylor are good for the precious few screen time they have, the four kids are very good, but Deep Roy steals the show in my opinion with the funniest part -- the Oompa Loompas. Deep Roy's musical numbers throughout the film are definitely the highlight of the movie. Christopher Lee does a fine job with his small role as Depp's father, while Tim Burton gives his best direction since Edward Swissorhands. 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory' posses Oscar worthy set, makeup, costumes and visual effects, while the script is very solid. I'd say one of the only things that bothered me about this besides it being extremely weird, is the hidden sexual references throughout. I felt it was very unnecessary and instead of laughing at them, I kind of rolled my eyes in disappointment. Everything else in the film however is brilliant.<br/><br/>I highly recommend seeing 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory' in the theater if you are a fan of the novel, original film or just love extravagant and bizarre motion pictures. People expecting something very mainstream I think might be let down with Burton's take on the classic children's book, but I actually applauded the fact the film possessed bizarre qualities. For the best viewing experience, I recommend seeing it in IMAX in select AMC theaters. Grade: B+ (screened at AMC Deer Valley 30 (the IMAX experience), Phoenix, Arizona, 7/21/05)<br/><br/>my ratings guide - A+ (absolutley flawless); A (a masterpiece, near-perfect); A- (excellent); B+ (great); B (very good); B- (good); C+ (a mixed bag); C (average); C- (disappointing); D+ (bad); D (very bad); D- (absolutley horrendous); F (not one redeeming quality in this hunk of Hollywood feces)."
"Robert_duder","8","4","6","8 August 2005"," A dark remake more for the reminiscent adults
","Willy Wonka and The Chocolate Factory is now considered something of a classic in film for Children. Everyone seems to remember seeing the original and it was with these memories that I went to see the Tim Burton recreation Charlie and The Chocolate Factory. If Burton is known for anything it's dark, sometimes twisted comedy and The Chocolate Factory seems like a no brainer story for him. I have never read the novels by Dahl but I understand Burton's version is much more true to the book.<br/><br/>Charlie and The Chocolate Factory is the story of a young boy and his impoverished family barely surviving. They live in a small European type village where the claim to fame is the infamous Willy Wonka's Chocolate factory where Charlie's Grandfather used to work until a mole that was stealing Wonka's secrets caused Wonka to shut everything down and close up the factory. It was years before suddenly Wonka started making his wonderful candies and chocolate again but without the help of anyone it seemed. Out of the blue Wonka makes a worldwide announcement that he is placing only five Golden Tickets in his Wonka bars for five lucky boys or girls and that will give them the privilege of being shown around the infamous Chocolate factory by Wonka himself. Not only that but one of those lucky five will get a great prize. Charlie is thrilled about the idea of getting one of those tickets but rather discouraged knowing that he only gets one Wonka bar a year on his birthday and therefore only once chance at the ticket. He opens his birthday bar with his family anxiously looking on but gets nothing. They all watch as rich, stuck up, snobby greedy kids win the tickets one by one. Charlie's Grandfather surprises Charlie with a dollar to buy another Wonka bar and Charlie does, but again he gets nothing. All hope seems lost as there is only one golden ticket left. After a false ticket surfaces Charlie comes across a ten dollar bill in the street and immediately buys one more candy bar. He slowly unwraps it and sure enough Charlie has found the last Golden ticket. Inviting his Grandfather to join him, he enter the factory with four other children and their parents. Wonka is odd, weird, eccentric but introduces them to a mysterious, beautiful and odd world of chocolate and candy and a mysterious race of beings called Oompa Loompas. As they tour the factory Wonka looks back on his childhood and we see a little of what made him become what he is. As the tour continues each child is subjected to their moral weakness so to speak and it causes them to meet their dramatic exit from the factory (none are hurt only extradited), until only Charlie is left. From process of elimination Charlie will be offered the greatest gift ever but by turning it down he will not only change his own life but the life of Willy Wonka as well.<br/><br/>First off Johnny Depp is brilliant...bring on the little Golden statue cause so far he is the deserving one. I really wasn't sure when I saw the commercials, it seems like a rather TOO odd performance but instead he is brilliant, and funny, and completely off the wall in a very real way. Gene Wilder may always be Willy Wonka but Johnny Depp creates a whole new look to the part. Freddie Highmore who was completely brilliant opposite Depp in Finding Neverland continues his rise to stardom playing a very emotional and touching role as Charlie. David Kelly as Charlie's Grandpa also does a very good job, everyone adds their personality to the film. Burton creates a beautiful, and cartoony but still dark world inside the factory. Julia Winter (Veruca Salt-The Spoiled rich kid), Jordan Fry (Mike Teavee the spoiled violent genius), Philip Wiegratz (Augustus Gloop-The Greedy over eater), Annasophia Robb, (the horrible little over achiever Violet Beauregarde)all do an amazing job in their respective roles and we love seeing them meet their rather disturbing ends, although the film always make it explicitly clear that the children are not being harmed. The film is an awesome adventure. However I can't quite explain the ""G"" Rating because I wouldn't want my young kids seeing this film?? The original was a little dark but musical and more light hearted. Burton doesn't put a lot of light heart into this one with the exception of Charlie and his morality and family values. Wonka himself is off the wall weird and dark and there are numerous expressions that might be over the head of little ones but adult aimed nonetheless. Danny Elfman's familiar dark music adds to the atmosphere. It certainly makes the film all the more entertaining for adults and I am sure any fan of the original will be delighted to see a more mature update. This is definitely worth seeing!! 8/10"
"rparham","8","4","6","7 August 2005"," Enjoy this tour of the ""Factory""
","Director Tim Burton has interest only in those you would consider outsiders. Normal people hold no appeal to him, so Burton is at his best when the film he makes focuses it's attention on those we would consider to be outside the norm. Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, based on the novel by Roald Dahl, is a film right up Burton's alley, featuring the eccentric character of Willy Wonka and his amazing candy factory. Dahl's point of view, to attempt to teach morals featuring rather reprehensible ""normal"" people, puts all his attention toward the oddities. I don't think Burton would want it any other way.<br/><br/>For the few that don't know, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory was previously adapted for the big screen by directory Mel Stuart in the early-1970s film Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory that starred Gene Wilder in the title role. Willy Wonka has become recognized as a classic, famous among other things for it's funny morality songs belted out by the diminutive Oompa Loompas. Burton was not among the fans of the original film, which was reportedly not enjoyed by Dahl himself. Burton's take on the material is similar in many respects, but very different in others.<br/><br/>Charlie and the Chocolate Factory focuses on Charlie Bucket (Freddie Highmore), a poor boy who lives in a slightly off-kilter house with his mother (Helena Bonham-Carter), father (Noah Taylor) and two sets of grandparents. Soon, eccentric chocolatier Willy Wonka (Johnny Depp), has announced that he has placed five golden tickets in five random Wonka chocolate bars. He has kept his candy factory closed off to outsiders for years, and now will allow the five children who find the golden tickets in the candy to have access to his factory, along with one guardian each. Four of the five tickets are discovered by some rather unsavory characters: Augustus Gloop (Phillip Wiegratz), a fat overeater, Violet Beauregarde (Annasophia Robb), a gum-chewing overachiever, Veruca Salt (Julia Winter), a spoiled brat, and Mike Teaveee (Jordan Fry), a genius who is infatuated with video games. Charlie makes the fifth, and is accompanied by his Grandpa Joe (David Kelley), who used to work at the factory. They are greeted by Willy Wonka at the entrance at the factory and are escorted throughout by Willy as they visit the various exotic sections of the factory and the surprises contained within.<br/><br/>The center of the film is the performance of Johnny Depp as Willy Wonka. With a long velvet coat, white face, perfect teeth, and bob haircut, Depp creates a rather naïve but at the same time strangely twisted character. Wonka is a shut-in who has lost all contact and sense of the real world, who is repulsed by the children he has invited and cannot bring himself to say the word ""parents"", because of his damaged relationship with his own father, a dentist who forbade him candy, portrayed by Christopher Lee. Unlike Wilder's interpretation which was a little more warm, Depp is off-putting and distant, but enormously fun to watch. Depp is nothing if not entertaining, and he makes Wonka his own.<br/><br/>The majority of the film unfolds in Wonka's factory, which has been realized by production designer Alex McDowell as a rather unique environment, full of curves and elliptical environments, appearing very much as if designed in the 1960's. The factory is once again populated by the Oompa Loompas, here realized by a single performer, Deep Roy, replicated digitally to create an entire population of small workers. And, once again, the Oompa Loompas belt out a number of funny musical numbers, realized in a variety of styles and dance numbers that are very amusing. <br/><br/>It's obvious that Dahl was trying to teach some values to children about selfishness and excess, and most of those sequences as each of the children are treated to their fate are appropriately over-the-top to get the point across but not so much that it turns the audience off. <br/><br/>As with almost all of Burton's films, the production design and cinematography go hand in hand to create a visually arresting picture. The factory interiors, an Indian temple created out of chocolate, the Bucket household that is latterly listing to one side, all of it is rendered in Burton's usual unique style that is arresting to look at.<br/><br/>If Charlie and the Chocolate Factory has one weakness, it is that once again, Burton has chosen to focus the attention on Wonka, and Charlie and his family feels a little short- changed by the script. They are not completely underused, but you don't quite feel to attachment to them that you should. Again, Burton's lack of interest in the ""normal"" world comes back to haunt him.<br/><br/>Aside from that minor complaint, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is an entertaining and enjoyable romp that is worth checking out."
"DICK STEEL","10","4","6","7 August 2005"," A Nutshell Review: Charlie and the Chocolate Factory
","Roald Dahl wrote countless of books, many of which I grew up reading in secondary school. There are many of his works adapted for the screen as well (The Witches, Matilda), but none so far given the Tim Burton treatment.<br/><br/>The opening credits/scene has Burton's fingerprints all over - the imaginative sequence, the Gothic soundtrack (done by long time Burton collaborator Danny Elfman), mammoth weird looking architecture and snow filled landscapes.<br/><br/>In the beginning, we are brought to the small world of Charlie Bucket, whose family find difficulty in making ends meet. As Wonka announces the 5 Golden Tickets (for a special visit to his factory) hidden in his chocolate bars, we are introduced to the backgrounds of the other children's family and stereotypical character, like the German glutton, the English brat, the American go-getter, and the Television (Wonka accused of mumbling) boy. And no doubt, the audience will definitely root for the time when Charlie actually gets his ticket and join the rest.<br/><br/>Willy Wonka is the number one Chocolateer, but he certainly has issues relating to people, and I guess nobody can blame him after having his ""Secret Recipe"" hijacked by corporate espionage. We are told of Wonka's background in a series of flashbacks throughout the plot, and one of my favourites is when he journeyed and stumbled upon the Oopma Loompas.<br/><br/>As the narrative gets predictable, it actually turned it into its advantage, as the audience expects to see some innovative room in its spectacular imaginative splendour, the set pieces in which the children get themselves into, and the performance of the little Oompa Loompa people, whose hilarious spontaneous song and dance routine will definitely leave you laughing out loud.<br/><br/>Towards the end, after the side-splitting zaniness of the factory excursion, the theme of Family is highlighted, and nicely wraps up the movie, both for Wonka and Charlie.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp is class, but really though, I thought his Willy Wonka actually adapted Michael Jackson's look and nuances. He managed to highlight Wonka's freakiness and child like nature to a T, and Depp has shown he has done no wrong with diverse roles in Tim Burton's visionary movies. Also remarkable is his recommendation of Freddie Highmore into the role of Charlie. If you'd remember, they worked together before in Finding Neverland, and their on screen chemistry was brought into this film as well. Many touching moments featuring Highmore will tug at your heartstrings, and I suppose besides Dakota Fanning, he's one of my favourite child actors of today.<br/><br/>I can't rave enough of the sets created for this film, with its wonderful use of colours. And besides scoring the film's soundtrack, Danny Elfman also provided the unique sounding voice of the Oompa Loompas, and purist of the book will be glad that the lyrics for most of their performances were from Dahl himself.<br/><br/>Although adapted from a children's book, this is one movie I'd recommend to adults as well. I guess Roald Dahl would have been proud of this effort! Bring out the Wonka bars!"
"davelfla","7","4","6","20 July 2005"," Good time, flashbacks for babyboomers are hilarious.
","Yesterday we saw Charlie and the Chocolate Factory - it was a beautiful production and had us crying multiple times throughout, some very very funny moments - the only problem is Johnny Depp as Willie Wonka, he never establishes a character and is weak. I think Gene Wilder will always have that role nailed in our minds, and Johnny can't crack it.<br/><br/>The oompa-loompas are particularly well produced, especially considering it is all just one actor.<br/><br/>The problem with Johnny is we keep expecting him to express a viewpoint or have an attitude other than blasé. He has a lot of clever one liners and his deadpan ""factoids"" were funny.<br/><br/>The movie never takes itself too seriously, which is a major selling point. The characters all seem to know they are in a movie and are winking at the audience."
"jamesroyalty05","8","4","6","17 July 2005"," Just as good and Sometimes better than the original film!
","This movie is a good movie for all to see. It has a good storyline and that is all I will say about that. It is definitely worth spending money to go see, but not the best movie, I would say. I am very pleased with this version of the movie, and I think the way it portrays Wonka in this movie is closer to the intentions of Rohald Dahl, meaning that this movie brings out the real Willy Wonka. Without giving a spoiler, this movie definitely makes you feel more like what the characters were intended to be like, thus making you feel more into this movie. (e.g.making you feel sadder at parts in the storyline that you might not have been as sad at in the original film.)"
"sharon_hunt","8","4","6","17 July 2005"," Better be good with chocolate in the title
","I loved this film from beginning to end. It was better than the original in almost every way. I love the new Oompa Loompas and Johnny Depp is terrific. Nothing against Gene Wilder but I always thought his Willy Wonka portrayal was cold and creepy. Johnny Depp plays the character so much more sympathetically. Plus, it was an improvement to get the background on his character.<br/><br/>The one thing I did miss from the older version is the Oompa Loompas song. The new versions of the songs are definitely rockin'. But I couldn't understand what was being said half the time. especially with the TV kid.<br/><br/>This movie was better than I expected. Great job."
"jmille42","7","4","6","17 July 2005"," a funny good time for kids and adults
","The brilliant Tim Burton impresses me once again, this time with his dark remake of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (I will be the first to admit that I was expecting a corny family filmit proved me wrong). Young and charming Charlie Bucket (Freddie Highmore) has only one wish, and that is to visit the legendary chocolate factory of Willy Wonka. Johnny Depp stars as the upbeat, yet bitter candy man (his version portrays Wonka as a wannabe crack addictand it works very well in this ""family"" film). Charlie gets his wish after several attempts and finds a golden ticket, giving him and his Grandpa Joe (David Kelly) a free tour of the factory led by Wonka himself. Along with four other snot-nosed brats and their parents, the group finds mischief and adventure around every corner.<br/><br/>Burton's bright and colorful world for the film contradicts his usual darker style (like Batman and Edward Scissorhands), but it works as for one day the young boy goes from a life of poverty to riches in what many children would depict to be there own version of heavencandy everywhere and very bright lights.<br/><br/>The choice of Depp to play Wonka could not have been any better of a fit. He's irritable, cranky, careless, and dumb. Not to say Johnny is any of those things in real life (wink wink), but if you want an actor to pull it off and still have all of America love you for itthen Johnny is your man. This is a funny good time for kids and adults (I actually saw more people my age than kids at the theater)."
"NJMoon","7","4","6","15 July 2005"," Dark & Semi-Sweet (but Never Gooey)
","Tim Burton and Johnny Depp indulge their inner child once more with this bag of mixed nuts. While some moments work brilliantly (Burton's fantastic visual sense is perfectly suited to the material) other moments are are a bit of a let-down. It's not really possible to discuss this film without mentioning the Roald Dahl book and the first film, so I won't even try. Depp mystified me with his freakish Jack Sparrow in THE PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN - camp for camp's sake. Here camp is in full session again but Burton has the smarts to temper Depp's tart eccentricity with flashbacks to Wonka's troubled youth. While these don't really add much story-wise, they do help us understand Depp's choices. In the end, however, it isn't nearly enough to make Wonka a real character, especially when played against the ultra-reality of Highmore's introspective Charlie Bucket. While Burton's visual flair is at it's most impressive, he misses some of the small details: Charlie's eventual discovery of the golden ticket, for instance, is rushed through as if to say ""You know what happens here"". Harsh contrast to the first film which featured the torturous slow unwrapping of the bar, the pained look of anticipation on Charlie's angelic face, that wonderful glint of light off the first glimmer of gold, and the triumphant swell of orchestral brass braying ""I've got a golden ticket"" as Bucket ran joyously home. Burton also miss-steps with the film's ending, which goes on far too long. Because we've seen Wonka in therapy (literally), Burton feels obliged to give us the treacly slow awakening of mental health and acceptance of self starting with a visit to Willy's father, Dr. Wonka DDS (Christopher Plummer). While I admire the clever contrast of dentist dad and confectioner kid (not found in Dahl or WILLY #1), I couldn't help longing for the concise culmination of the first film: Charlie passes test - Charlie wins factory - fade out. But all in all, riding the Wonkavator or the Wonkatania with Captain Burton is a visual feast not to be missed."

","I just saw Charlie and the Chocolate Factory today, and I found it to be a delightful experience.Tim Burton and Jonny Depp did it yet once again.Depp is amazing as the eccentric Willy Wonka and Burton did a great job directing..When you first see the inside of Wonk'a factory, it sort of reminded me when you first saw Oz in the Wizard of Oz...meaning very colorful. This adaption I heard is more like the book than the original film from 1971 starring Gene Wilder, Some of the parts are different, but the main story is just the same as the original,,In my opinion only Jonny Depp could have pulled of playing the main character which he does brilliantly.In conclusion, this is one movie not to be missed....My hats off to Tim Burton, Jonny Depp and of course the kids for making this one entertaining movie!!"

Now I'm a HUGE fan of Johnny so I was excited to see it, but in the back of my mind, I was thinking, ""oh wow, the first one was actually almost perfect, how can you redo it & NOT flop?"" But Tim Burton was smart on that one lol...It really is different from the 1st original movie. Yes, the principle is the same, but it's not the same movie. Johnny is hilarious & really shows what an amazing actor he is. For all the people that only saw Pirates & thought he was good, you'll be amazed at his wide range of characters. To go from Jack Sparrow to Willy Wonka, well that's rather a stretch, but Johnny handles it well. He's amazing. Freddie Highmore was so cute & innocent. I think he's becoming a wonderful actor. He shows so much emotion & really gets you to believe him. All the other children were true to their character & made you hate them lol They were also amazing! The film was just wonderful & I don't think it can be compared with the original because it's different. It's stupid for everyone to be comparing the original & this one. They are two different movies & this one is NOT a remake. But it's awesome on a different scale & level. You should definitely go see it, it's wonderful & funny! I actually laughed through it!<br/><br/>The original was amazing in its own right, but this one is equally awesome!"
"leglistux","3","11","23","19 July 2005"," My problems with this boring movie
","First off, I am fully aware that this is in no way a remake of the '71 version with Gene Wilder, and I know that this version is more true to the book, so don't bug me about the comparisons I am about to make. My only problem with this movie is that they could have at least made it remotely enjoyable. First off, this movie tried waaaaaay too hard to be funny, with little success. Of course in my theatre I heard all the stupid kids laughing(yes I know, it's a kid's movie, but I don't care) and some adults. I didn't laugh once, I snickered a few times though, but I don't watch movies to snicker. The jokes were lame and the movie lagged like no other, I was so happy when it was over. The oompa loompas were EXTREMELY annoying, but their songs were good, not the actual music but the lyrics so props to that. The '71 version at least made me laugh and it was entertaining, unlike this one which I can't say enough! The one part I remember from the early one was the moment when Charlie opened the wrapper of the golden ticket-he did it ever so slowly and when he finally saw the gold it made it such a great scene. Every single time I see that part it makes me so happy that the poor kid actually found it. In this version, he opened it so fast and so blah that I just sat there with a grim look on my face just thinking what a boring scene i just witnessed. That pretty much summed up how the whole movie was for me, very bland and not funny at all."
"queenofthestars-1","1","7","13","16 December 2009"," Can't decide...
","I can't decide whether the people who write positive reviews about this movie simply have very low IQs (maybe 80 or so) or are just being paid heaps of money by somebody to advertise the movie on IMDb. I don't understand how someone of even moderate intelligence could like this movie. I'm not going to go into its many, many, MANY faults because everyone else has, but I am just intrigued at the fact that there are ANY positive reviews at all.<br/><br/>To all those who thought he looked like Michael Jackson: I always thought so too. I'm glad I'm not the only one. It makes the Depp's portrayal of his character even creepier, given the allegations made about Jackson.<br/><br/>It's a pity, really, because Depp is a fairly good actor, when he has good material. I wouldn't say I liked him in all of his movies, but he's not a bad actor. Just terribly, terribly WRONG for this movie.<br/><br/>Mind you, I doubt it would have been any better if someone else had played Wonka, there are so many things wrong with this movie (kids, parents, Oompa-Loompas, music - WHERE are the good songs? - melting puppets, the script...if I wanted to submit myself to the torture of seeing the movie again I'm sure I could find more things, but I don't). I'm glad I didn't pay any money to see it.<br/><br/>I've recently watched the original for the first time in probably about a decade, and I love it even more than I used to. Wilder's dead-pan ""No. Don't. Stop."" is delightful, along with ""I know a worse one"" in response to Veronica's ""Spitting is a dirty habit"" while picking her nose. He plays the eccentric recluse wonderfully. On the other hand, Depp's dismissal of the children when they offer to introduce themselves is annoying and pathetic. The whole reason Wonka distributed the golden tickets was to find a potential heir (though why, at his age? He doesn't even look forty!) - shouldn't he try to learn as much as possible about the children for that purpose? There, I did go into it a tiny bit - merely the tip of the iceberg, though. (Where's the psychedelic boat ride? Mind you, I don't think they could have pulled it off with the high-pitched voice they used for Wonka.) Honestly, how anyone could really like this is beyond me.<br/><br/>Bewildered"
"soriano329","9","7","13","24 December 2006"," The Sweetest Movie of the Year
","It's hard to describe your experiences in a Tim Burton movie. They are odd, to say the least, and sometimes creepy. Sometimes they are colorful, and sometimes they're black. But they are always something special, and Burton doesn't let us down in his latest flick ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory."" It's a moving coloring book, with stunningly beautiful colors and creative sets and costumes. It just makes me sad that the real world isn't this rich.<br/><br/>The most common misconception about the movie is that it is a remake of the timeless ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory."" It's not. Charlie and the Chocolate Factory isn't a remake, but rather another adaptation of the classic children's story of the same title. Keeping true to the book, screenwriter John August mixes quirky humor and creepy tempo to concoct one of the year's best movies.<br/><br/>""Charlie"" is a story of an ordinary little boy named Charlie Bucket (Freddie Highmore). He was not faster, or stronger, or more clever than other children. His family was not rich or powerful or well-connected; in fact, they barely had enough to eat. But Charlie was the luckiest boy in the whole world, he just didn't know it yet.<br/><br/>Charlie lives with his family; his two parents and his four grandparents. His grandparents: Joe, Josephine, George, and Georgina, never leave their bed, and Georgina is a little out of it, to say the least. Charlie sleeps next to a hole in the wall, which can be quite cold in winter, but he doesn't care, because the hole allows him to look at the greatest chocolate factory in the world, the one belonging to Willy Wonka.<br/><br/>After some fifteen years, Willy Wonka decides to open his factory gatesfor five lucky people. He places five golden tickets in five ordinary Wonka bars, the finders of which win a tour through his amazing factory. As people around the world frantically buy Wonka bars in search of the tickets, they are slowly found, one here, one there. Charlie desperately wants to go to the factory, but he only gets one bar of chocolate a year, on his birthday.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp gives one of the best performances of his career as the eccentric chocolate entrepreneur Willy Wonka. His exotic style and off-beat jokes almost mock Michael Jackson, but are original in its own. Depp leads an already all star cast including Helena Bonham Carter, Christopher Lee, and Deep Roy (who might as well be the star of the movie). Tim Burton directed it, and Danny Elfman created the score.<br/><br/>No one ever thought it, but Charlie has actually surpassed its predecessor. Burton has delivered another classic, putting it up there with Edward Scissorhands and The Nightmare Before Christmas. But Charlie and the Chocolate Factory isn't just mere entertainment, it also teaches us something. It reinforces the age old themes ""greed is not a virtue,"" and ""curiosity killed the cat."" But all virtues aside, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is definitely worth a viewing or two, and is by far the year's sweetest movie."
"FordPrefect-42","10","7","13","27 July 2005"," Amazing movie!
","I saw this last weekend because ""The Island"" wasn't playing at four. I was blown away! I was looking forward to seeing ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" but did not think that it would be this good! I have seen the original and have never really enjoyed it very much, ""Charlie"" held my attention from beginning to end. Tim Burton creates a wonderful world of imagination, color, and magic.<br/><br/>I've heard a lot of people say that they didn't like it because Johnny Depp ""Act's like Michal Jackson"" Well, if you have read ANYTHING Johnny Depp has said about this you will know that he did NOT base Willi Wonka's Character on Jackson. I personally thought he was funny (as did everyone else in the theater I was in) and the back story that Tim Burton and John August have added to his character explain why he acts so... different.<br/><br/>This is a wonderful movie, and one of my personal favorites.<br/><br/>10 stars outta 10!"
"rowdyreptile-2","9","7","13","18 July 2005"," Don't listen to the critics... This movie has charm
","I saw ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" this weekend just after it opened, and all I can say is that I thought it was a heck of a lot better than the critics made it out to be. Johnny Depp played the part of Willy Wonka exactly as I had pictured him from the book, and it was a shock to know that this quirky chocolate maker had also been Capt. Jack Sparrow from ""Pirates of the Caribbean."" Talk about talent. Another thing was that the movie followed the book a lot better than the original ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory."" There were a few parts added to give Wonka some background, but nothing major. Plus, all of the other actors (the children, in particular) gave perfect portrayals of their parts. This is a must see for the whole family!"
"pounder525","10","9","18","18 July 2005"," another hit
","Is it just me, or do Tim Burton and Johnny Depp just go well together? Their first collaboration was ""Edward Scissorhands"" and amazed audiences in the early nineties. They teamed up again in 1999 to make ""Sleepy Hallow."" Again they made a wonderful movie. They have come together again to make ""Charlie and the Chocolate factory"" and I think that audiences will be pleasantly surprised with this movie. A Quasi-remake of the old 1971 film ""Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory"" staring Gene Wilder, the newer ""Charlie and the Chocolate factory"" goes in a very different direction mainly with the character of Willy Wonka. The stock characters of the various children that enter the factory with Charlie stay relatively the same. Mike ""T.V."" changes partially to a video game wiz-kid Violate is turned into an overconfident bratty martial artist, but they are still the same basic character. Even Charlie and his Grandfather stay mostly the same.<br/><br/>While I have not read the book ""Charlie and the Chocolate factory"", from what I have heard, the newer version follows the book more closely than the original film, and this can be partially given credit for the changes.<br/><br/>Those of you who thought that the original ""Willy Wonka & The Chocolate Factory"" was ""creepy"", I would encourage you to try this movie out if only on DVD or VHS. Tim Burton brings a new outlook to the Oompa Loompa's and as such changes the feel of this film significantly.<br/><br/>For any Tim Burton fan this is another must see. If you aren't sure then I would say to trust Tim Burton and his artistic take on things. With such hits like ""The Nightmare before Christmas"", ""Beetle Juice"", and ""Big Fish"" you can trust that his directing will keep you captivated for a few days after you see the movie."

","Johnny Depp is a strange, quite bad, scraggly-looking actor. Tim Burton decided to swank up and nice, happy-go-lucky children's story into his ""Look at me I'm Tim Burton and I will swank up this movie and show you how swank I am"" movie. In addition, Willy Wonka never looked like a pimp, as he does in the movie, with a face that looks like it's made out of plastic. By the way the self-indulgent claptrap trailer that the audience hissed at, is no different than what one visualizes when on a trip of acid and/or LSD. Another thing, I'm pretty sure Johnny Depp is imitating Michael Jackson. Well anyways, my point is, don't see this incoherent, swanky, acid-trip like, lame embarrassment to the cinematic arts."
"MartinHafer","9","6","11","20 May 2008"," Aside from a bizarre ending, this film is great and sticks pretty close to the book
","I liked the old WILLY WONKA film and when I heard they were going to do a remake, I was very skeptical--especially when knuckleheads on the internet kept started circulating rumors that Marilyn Manson was going to play the lead!! Fortunately, this was only a dopey rumor and I am pleased to say that I am glad they remade this film, since it sticks much closer to the book by Roald Dahl and because I liked the dark Tim Burton style. Unlike the original, this isn't as much of a musical and it has a wicked sense of humor. However, oddly, while being very dark, unlike WILLY WONKA, the film showed that the bad children were alright by the end of the film. If you never read the books, when you watch the original movie you might just think the brats died! Most of the reason the film is better is the clever script, though it didn't hurt that they were able to use modern special effects that were light-years ahead of the 1971 film. Additionally, while I liked Gene Wilder as Willy, the dark and twisted and possibly crazy Willy played by Johnny Depp was a hoot to watch. I also loved the new version of Oompa-loompas--so creepy and cool compared to the annoying orange freaks from the older film.<br/><br/>I liked just about everything about the new film. The only part I wasn't thrilled with was the tacked on epilogue which starred Christopher Lee. While I love seeing Lee in films (except when he was in the Star Wars movies--this is best forgotten), none of this was in the book and just seemed out of place--though also a bit fun. Purists (like myself) may not like this, but most out there probably won't mind at all with this addition.<br/><br/>Finally, I should point out that this is definitely a more adult version of the story. Young children probably should NOT watch the film--especially if they are impressionable of really, really young. However, for older kids, teen and adults, this remake is the better bet because it's funnier and quite clever and NEVER cloying or schmaltzy."

","Charlie and the Chocolate Factory/2005/**1/2<br/><br/>Main Stars: Johnny Depp Freddie Highmore David Kelley Deep Roy<br/><br/>It wasn't a really good movie. Just because this movie follows the book by Roald Dahl more than the original movie (""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"") doesn't mean it is better. The movie was good at the beginning but it went a bit downhill when Willy Wonka (Johnny Depp) appeared in the movie. There are a few reasons why I did and did not like this film; one of the reasons why I did not like this film was: Johnny Depp (Willy Wonka) had a very pale face and a very annoying voice in this movie. The reason why he wanted to be like this is because he intended to be like a kids' talk show host but some people predict he intended to be kind of like Michael Jackson in this movie. Even if he intended to be like Michael Jackson it would be weird anyway. Another reason is that the acting was not Oscar-caliber although Charlie (Freddie Highmore) and his Grandpa Joe (David Kelley) were good. The last reason is that this was the strangest and quirkiest movie I saw this year and I really can't explain how it was strange and quirky, it just was. The things I did like were the sets of the movie and Danny Elfman's musical score. It was also creative how the oompa-loompas' were played by the exact same person (Deep Roy). The story was kind of interesting, too. There were quite a few sets in this movie (the chocolate factory, the house, etc.) and they were all fantastic! There were a few comedy scenes but not many. In comparison, I'll have to say the original was better than this one. These are the reasons why I liked the original better than this one: Better acting (Gene Wilder as Willy Wonka, for instance), more songs, better screenplay and it was overall delightful! Original movie directed by Mel Stuart. ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" directed by Tim Burton."

","The movie that is meant to focus on the book closely did an exceptional job in keeping to the format of the book of Roald Dahls book. I loved every moment of it. I can recommend this movie to others because i liked it that much. If i could watch it in any other way I would because it has a really good format and keeps me wanting to watch more. As soon as i say the first few minutes of it i wanted to watch more and more and i was so engulfed by the movie and i couldn't stop watching it. If you read the Roald Dahl book and really liked the way that it then this is Definitely the movie that you should watch because it is the better one of the two that are already in existence i.e. Willy Wonka being Gene Wilder in the older one and Johnny Depp in this one."

","I will admit, that I was expecting a dark, dark film by Tim Burton, but was a little disappointed, and at the same time happy since it is a kid's movie, that it wasn't. Johnny Depp was outstanding, as always, and there were times when I found I had to remind myself that it was actually him, because he is so believable in every character that he portrays. I also don't think, I've ever seen a bad Depp film, and this one is included.<br/><br/>Based on the novel, and the original film, ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"" with Gene Wilder as Willy Wonka, Johnny Depp now takes the lead in this quirky, unusual type family film. I was impressed with everyone involved with the film, especially the little girl that played Verusa. She was outstanding, and what I think I was most impressed with more than anything else, was how much like they were able to get two of the children to look just like two of the original children in the previous film.<br/><br/>It was funny, and there were a few very touching scenes. I was obviously very impressed with Johnny Depp's performance, but then, when am I not? It was a great watch, and I recommend it to kids and adults of all ages, there is nothing in the film to be offended by, and even adults will enjoy it."

","Now, I love Johnny Depp. I always enjoy his performances, if not the entire movie. Such is the case with Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.<br/><br/>I could never quite get into his version of Wonka. It was just too strange. Everything seemed to scream ""Look at me!"" The dance sequences were atrocious, and the entire movie was slow.<br/><br/>The sets were beautiful, really well done. That was the standout in the movie - the sets. The cast was well chosen, but they all looked really stiff. Nobody seemed to react like they should. The kids were spectacular, I have to say they out did the adults for sure. <br/><br/>It was OK. Probably a good rental for the kids. Personally, I'd take the original over this one any day."
"Davyd420","9","6","11","11 August 2005"," A remake that is worthy.
","The Wizard of Oz, Charolette's Web, Mary Poppins, and of course Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory were my favorites as a kid. I remember popping popcorn and spreading my sleeping bag out on the floor directly in front of the television to be sure I had a front row seat for the very rare occurrence of a network special presentation for one of these films. Gene Wilder will always be The Candyman that made the world taste good, and I still hear his voice to this day singing those exact words. Mr. Wilder, you've brought joy and laughter to millions throughout your career, and as far as Hollywood Legends go, you truly are the Everlasting Gobstopper.<br/><br/>Now about this time last year when word of the remake started to circulate the headlines I thought what is happening to Hollywood. You can't just simply remake such a beloved classic. Then word reached my ears that Tim Burton was set to direct and Johnny Depp to star as Mr. Wonka. I then saw hope, for they had chosen an actor I believe could pull off anything, and Johnny Depp delivers a fantastic performance. <br/><br/>The story, with slight alterations at the end, remains practically unchanged. Even the sets and wardrobe hadn't appeared to have strayed too far, however there seemed to be a darker feel or perhaps a sinister undertone to the overall film and specifically the character of Wonka. I'm guessing Director Tim Burton may have put some personal touches on the film that are unique to his dark, but intriguing style. And with the help of such a talented actor, that he obliviously favors, it's really no surprise the end result would dazzle the audience. Depp delivers us a more eccentric and sarcastic Candyman, where Wilder was more enthusiastic, humorous, and witty. Either way, all the pieces fit and a new generation will get to enjoy a wonderfully surreal Chocolate Factory."
"mulsteff","9","6","11","1 August 2005"," See this film!!
","With all the expectations surrounding this film and the shadow of the earlier version, I wasn't sure what to expect from Burton....but I have to say this is one of the most entertaining films i have seen in a long time. Although it's a kids story, and I was expecting a kid's film, it's impossible not to get lost in the magic of the whole thing. The story, of course, is fantastic to start with thanks to Dahl, but the big screen version manages to absorb you completely and brings it to life brilliantly. It's beautiful to look at and somehow, completely believable! Jonny Depp is amazing and definitely manages to steer away from merely recreating the Willy Wonka from the last film - fantastic and disturbing all at the same time. The whole cast works brilliantly together and Charlie Bucket is definitely one to be watched for the future.<br/><br/>This version sticks to the book a lot more, so is quite different to the older film and also offers a lot of laughs for kids and parents alike. The sets are beautiful and the whole thing looks like a bag of candy from start to finish! As with most Burton films of course, there is a dark side to Charlie and the Chocolate Factory that makes the film really interesting and leads it to be a lot more than just a kids film.<br/><br/>As you can probably tell i really enjoyed this film lol :P and it's one DVD i'll definitely be buying on it's release. In fact I may just go and watch it at the cinemas again now...."
"phoenelai","10","6","11","27 July 2005"," Everlasting gob-stopper of a Film!!!!
","I think Charlie and the Chocolate Factory was a wonderful ride. It was very colorful, nice graphics, music (Elfman) and excellent characters. I like the old and new Willy Wonka but in this version...it appears they could do much more and better things (ex: Wonkavator and the boat ride). I think Gene Wilder and Johnny Depp did their own version of Wonka in their unique way. The updated Oompa Loompas(sp?) music was pretty neat as well, the songs were each different which was nice. I got tired of the Original Oompa song in the first movie so this was refreshing. I really was pretty sure that Tim Burton wouldn't mess this up and I believe he didn't. A well executed wonderful approach to this classic!"
"crowrobot","10","6","11","27 July 2005"," A cinematic treat...
","Tim Burton is back in town with 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory', a delightful new adaptation of the classic Road Dahl book. It's got everything you'd expect from a Tim Burton movie: Danny Elfman score, bizarre humor, wonderful production design, and another weird performance from Burton favorite Johnny Depp. Depp is Willy Wonka in one of the most original performances of the year.<br/><br/>Everyone knows the plot: Little Charlie Bucket (Freddie Highmore) is one of five kids who get to visit Willy Wonka's amazing chocolate factory. Charlie is a good boy, but the other four children are selfish and greedy. At the end of the day, four children have been punished, and Charlie is rewarded.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp is one of the best actors working today, and his strange performance as Willy Wonka proves it. His Wonka is germophobic, utters 60's catchphrases, and doesn't like parents. Truth be told, it's a better performance than Gene Wilder. The added subplot about Wonka's childhood and his stern dentist father (Christopher Lee) adds some interest, and it doesn't slow things down. Freddie Highmore, who was last seen with Depp in 'Finding Neverland', is great as Charlie, and I can't think of anyone else in the role. Special mention must also go to David Kelly, who infuses Charlie's Grandpa Joe with charm and enthusiasm.<br/><br/>The production is a beautiful one, and it showcases Burton's affinity for the bizarre. The special effects are impressive, too, and they're not bogged down with too much CGI. Danny Elfman's score is his best in years, and I found myself more than once humming along to the theme.<br/><br/>It is said that Roald Dahl hated the original 'Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory'. However, were he alive today, I think he would have liked this wonderful adaptation. It got the seal of approval from his family, after all. 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory' is a terrific film."

","I thought this movie was excellent and definitely a lot better then the original. I give it 10 out of 10 stars, Two Thumbs Way Up! Finally they made an updated version of it with more sophisticated technology.<br/><br/>Everything in this movie is great, acting, costumes, production, script, directing, following of the book and many good lessons. Lessons in this movie include: being greedy is foolish, if you're spoiled and a brat no one will like you, it's disgusting to chew things all day long, there's other things to do besides watch t.v. and if you're nice and sweet good things will come your way.<br/><br/>The things I like in this movie were the Chocolate Room, Nut Room, Glass Elevator, etc.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp, also did a great and a lot better job then Gene Wilder as Willy Wonka!"

","This movie far exceeded any expectations I had about it. Since it's been a while since I read the book, I don't know how closely it follows, but it was laughter left and right. Johnny Depp's portrayal of chocolateer Willy Wonka was one of his best performances to date, his voice, his expressions, his general stature just added to the movie. Freddie Highmore was spot on as Charlie, and Christopher Lee was wonderful as Willy's dentist father. Christopher Lee is just meant to play the more evil characters. Deep Roy was hilarious in his role as the Oompa Loompas, who I love more than the other ones. Burton's use of flashback was also quite wonderful, and something deeply missed in the original.<br/><br/>The camera work in this was highly entertaining, and the set was just amazing. The colours used provided more than enough visual stimulant, and really brought out the characters.<br/><br/>However, when Willy and the gang were in the glass elevator (visiting the burn center and the like), I almost thought for a moment that I was watching Hitchhikers Guide again! It was like the planet workroom scene in H2G2.<br/><br/>All in all, this movie is definitely worth the money spent, and should be seen over and over again. I guarantee almost constant laughs."
"minorbird","1","9","19","25 July 2005"," Very bad movie...don't waste your money.
","Tim Burton's genius only goes so far. When I first heard of this remake (or not if you believe what they say), I thought to myself, ""Why would anyone want to mess with an absolute CLASSIC?"" Attention all movie producers/directors: LEAVE THE CLASSICS ALONE! Johnny Depp is a pasty/ghoulish/creepy Michael Jackson look alike...there could not have been a worse choice for the role of Willy Wonka. I believe Burton's love of Depp has unfortunately biased his judgment...yes, Depp is a good actor. But that does not mean he is right for every role.<br/><br/>The attempts at humor were just that - for there was nothing funny here. My theater was filled with adults and kids and after each joke you could hear the crickets chirping. I heard one person wonder out loud, ""Was that supposed to be funny?"" The music, although updated for today's kids, was so loud and obnoxious you couldn't hear most of the words of the Oompa Loompas, which were, BTW, a total disaster. One guy cloned? Oh, come on. Use CG only when you need it.<br/><br/>The characters had no depth, the acting wasn't so great, and damn...I just can't get over what a bad job Johnny Depp was at being Willy Wonka.<br/><br/>I've never read the book so I don't know how close this movie related, but I was expecting to hear ""the schnazzberries taste like schnazzberries"". It's a part of our vernacular (ref. the first ten minutes of 'Super Troopers'). What a disappointment to not have this in the movie.<br/><br/>Now that I've thought more about it, holy cow it was bad. I mean it physically hurt to sit through this movie.<br/><br/>Tim, The Nightmare Before Christmas is where your genius shined. Stick to those kinds of movies...and you'll be fine (you'll be happy to know I do plan to see ""The Corpse Bride"").<br/><br/>Hey, Depp, you're now typecast as a drunken pirate. Please don't do anything else but that.<br/><br/>Gene, sleep well knowing you'll never be replaced as Willy Wonka.<br/><br/>And for the last time, folks, LEAVE THE CLASSICS ALONE."

","To begin with, the music was horrendous. The Oompa Loompas in general were, like the rest of the film, butchered. They were not colorful, in the least, they wore tight plastic, sang horribly and every Oompa Loompa was played by the same character.<br/><br/>And Willy Wonka!! He was flat out cruel! The audience was supposed to connect with him, feel sorry for him! I understand his disgust for the other four children, but even towards Charlie and his grandfather he was cruel. And what was with the flash backs? Those were obnoxious and entirely pointless.<br/><br/>I understand they were necessary for the ending. But it, too, was butchered. The original ending made me want to cry and it had a real moral to it. I don't even know what to say about this new one.<br/><br/>All I have to say is that I hope parents have enough sense to rent the original Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory for their children, because it would be a shame to have to grow up with this version."

He is just creepy through the entire movie! The Oompa Loompas leave much to be desired this time. The original movie was fun whereas this one is just weird! The kid that played Charlie was OK but the other kids were just boring. While this movie may be closer to the original story just thought it to be a waste of my time. I really don't think that Dahl envisioned Wonka as an over feminine wacko. IMO rent the original and watch it at home! This movie was a HUGE disappointment!"
"solanki17","7","7","14","1 August 2005"," More like Johnny Depp's Chocolate Factory
","Having grown up reading the original book by Roald Dahl, and seeing the 1970's film version many times, I was looking for that little bit of child nostalgia when I entered the screening for this. Tim Burton directs and he is no stranger to remakes, re-imaginations or re-works what ever you want to call them (Planet of The Apes anyone?). Luckily for us, whenever Burton gets together with his favourite leading man, Johnny Depp its usually a recipe for success. Chocolate factory you'll be relieved to learn is no different, living up to the expectations, exceeding in some quarters but falling short in others. I'm sure you all know of the story, down on his luck, poverty stricken young boy, Charlie Bucket dreams of winning one of 5 golden tickets Willi Wonka places in his candy bars, thus allowing the lucky recipient a full days tour of his factory. No one has been in or out of the factory for many years. The adventure on screen takes us through the very pages of the book but also add's some backs story to Wonka's slightly weird outlook on life, it gives him a history and that little bit of depth that maybe had been missing in the Gene Wilder version. A few crucial things are missed out though like Charlie being so sometime sickly sweet, by the fact he follows the rules and doesn't do anything but what Mr Wonka tells him, there is also a slightly more extended glass elevator bit towards the end. All in all these minor alterations blend in well with the already so familiar storyline. The demise of each child within the chocolate factory tour is built up to a great climax each time, the only slightly alarming thing is the rather chipmunk style songs the extremely small Oompa Loompa's sing, I preferred the 1970's version songs here. The Oompa Loompa's themselves are magically played by Deep Roy in double role, they are made extra small with computer wizardry and this just add's to this wacky race of little people. Many reviews will rave about the child actors, Veruca Salt & Violet are both played really nastily by their respective child actresses, and Charlie will get plaudits too, played by Freddie Highmore (Finding Neverland). But personally I don't think he has as much meaty material as he could have had and he does a basic job of acting the sweet little kid, which I'm sure anyone could of. The real acting masterclass in this film is by miles Johnny Depp's magnificent performance of Willi Wonka, he plays the choclotier as if he was b to do so. The chocolate man's zany persona and troubled childhood becomes apparent through Depp's acting and the humour is magnified with his execution of the script. Depp has proved many times he can play off the wall characters (Blow, Jack Sparrow in Pirates of Caribbean), and this time he's done it again. Watch out for the constant banter between Depp and one of the kids Mike Teevee, Classic comedy moments! All in all the movie could have been a massive disappointment, and comparisons with the 70's version are going to happen regardless even though they are two different films of different era's and each stands alone on its own merits (one has better songs then the other, one has a better Willi Wonka then the other etc). But just enjoy this film for the great colourful grandeur scale sets, classic storyline and hilarious Depp performance of Wonka."
"andersonaimee-1","2","7","14","26 July 2005"," Don't waste your time
","I am a huge fan of the original Willy Wonka, and Gene Wilder was a genius in it. He gave the film a beautiful, heartwarming glimpse into the heart of an adult/child. Johnny Depp was absolutely horrible. It was an over dramatized version of play acting. I kept looking at my watch to see when this torture would end. If I hadn't been there with my 9 year old daughter, I would have left after the first hour. If you haven't seen the original, run out and watch it first. The oompah loompah's were so much better and all unique. The kids were better, etc... And, the grandparent's in this new version....jumping out of bed and doing a jig was really over the top.

"barstowsanta","9","7","14","16 July 2005"," Great ""ORIGINAL""! Not remake!
","This should be considered the ""ORIGINAL"" version of the book. Although the 1971 version was very entertaining, it was lacking the ""flavor"" of one of Roald Dahl's best works. Tim Burton did an excellent job recreating the book to the silver screen in what I consider to be a ""video"" version of the book! CHEERS!!!! The wonderfully strange Johnny Depp portrayed Wonka much like the book had described him. Don't be ""stuck"" on the Gene Wilder Version as it did not do justice to the story. Mostly Hollywood Hype & glitz & glamour was the selling point for the old version of this film. When you do decide to see this film, scrap all the ideas of it being like the 1971 version. Enjoy the film & consider it as a nice ""Stocking Stuffer"" for the upcoming Christmas season."
"shua-2","8","7","14","16 July 2005"," Truly worthwhile.
","This summer, my reactions to the new movies coming is always: Is it worth my time? I have to take the time to look it up here, read through the actors, look up the director's past works, and then decide whether I truly would like to see the movie or should I pass it off as (which I probably do way too much) just another blockbuster-popcorn-flick that I really don't care for. Well, this movie was different.<br/><br/>I remember searching for Tim Burton about a year ago. Just to see what he was working on. When I read that he was making Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, I knew what the world was in for. I've been a long time fan of director Tim Burton. I still remember receiving Nightmare Before Christmas (yes, I know he was the producer) when I was only six years old.<br/><br/>Now, I may be bias with this comment, because I didn't care for Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory. I felt it was too serious, too spooky, too creepy, and too depressing. Now, I love movies passed as a children's film but are in fact to scary for children and actually meant for adults, but Willy Wonka was too depressing even for parents.<br/><br/>Charlie and the Chocolate factory takes the magic, the color, the world, and the candy that Willy Wonka should have used and now makes it the norm. Tim Burton's interpretation (because this is not a remake) is a land of mischief, wackiness, and color. Oh! The color! Watching this movie is a feast for the eyes as much as it is a feast for the ears. Danny Elfman, Tim Burton's musical accomplice, does such a wonderful job (as he always does) for Charlie. The music gives you your thrills and chills while delivering to you the sweet reminder of home and happy times.<br/><br/>The acting? Superb. Every actor seemed to be made for their part. Each child actor was amazing. Far too often you have the child actor who will mumble their lines then look off screen and into the casting crew (probably at their parents), leaving you sad and angry at the poor performance. Where Tim Burton assembled this cast, I'll never know. Each actor and actress truly took their role to heart. They became the character.<br/><br/>While maybe not a family film, truly something to take the teenagers to. A delightful feast for the eyes and the ears. Tim Burton never fails to exceed expectations. Danny Elfman delivers a truly wonderful soundtrack. I give this eight out of ten for the sheer excellence of every aspect.<br/><br/>Choice acting performances: Johnny Depp as Willy Wonka, Freddie Highmore as Charlie Bucket, Missi Pyle as Mrs. Beauregarde, James Fox as Mr. Salt, David Morris as Grandpa George, Liz Smith as Grandma Georgina, Deep Roy as Oompa Loomp, and Noah Taylor and Helena Bonham Carter as Mr. and Mrs. Bucket.<br/><br/>Choice scenes: Seeing each child's reaction to finding a golden ticket, when all the Wonka factory workers are told to go away, any scenes inside the Bucket's home, Oompa Loompa dance scenes, and the special nod to 2001: A Space Odyssey throughout the entire Television Room scene."

","This movie was wonderful! Don't let anyone tell you otherwise. It was just as bizarre and creepy and magical and fun as Ronald Dahl's book. Don't bother comparing it to the other movie version, this one far surpasses it. I loved the back story for Wonka, it explains a lot. <br/><br/>This is a perfect movie for children of all ages. It teaches them about loving ones family and following ones dreams. And it does so in a lovingly sneaky way. The filming of this was done so well, it felt like a psychedelic Disney ride, annoying puppet songs and all. <br/><br/>Johny Depp did an amazing job as always. He really figured out how to pull off being creepy children's game show host while still being charming. He really made Wonka feel like an overgrown and misunderstood child.<br/><br/>I recommend this to all those who are children at heart."

","I was watching it with a girlfriend of mine when she suddenly got sick and had to go to the hospital. (Yes, she recovered and is fine.) So we only saw maybe the first half, but neither of us had a desire to see it any further anyway.<br/><br/>Not having read the Roald Dahl book, I cannot make the comparison to that. But we get, at the beginning, a long exposition of Willy Wonka's background, which I don't know if it was in the book. (I thought he was supposed to be a man of mystery?) And he has a creepy air about him-would anyone want to send a child unaccompanied into a locked factory with him?<br/><br/>Except for Charlie of the title, a good child living in poverty, the kids are not nice in one way or the other-greedy, bullying, etc., and bad things happen to them. Is this movie supposed to be a morality play? It seems a rather strange one."
"willow_xander_ever","2","5","9","23 July 2009"," Don't watch it.
","It's not good.<br/><br/>I've seen most of Tim Burton's movies and I think I'm up at 22 of Johnny Depp's. But I don't think I've ever been so disappointed in a movie before. The book (and the sequel, for that matter) are among some of my favorite children's books, and I couldn't wait to see the film adaptation, which I then, afterward, wished I hadn't.<br/><br/>It seems like a poor excuse on Burton's behalf to make yet another Depp movie where he plays a freak, to be frank. Johnny Depp's Wonka was everything Dahl's Wonka *wasn't*, and the movie focuses more on this character than the Buckets. Wonka was initially just a supporting character, in my opinion.<br/><br/>But it drags itself up to two stars for the cinematography or art direction or whatever made the movie beautiful to look at. But muting it while watching wouldn't hurt, it might even save you for the ruining of an old classic."

","Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is a great summer film. I was reluctant to see this at first, but my friends persuaded me to see it. I was not disappointed. Charlie lives with a poor family in a shack. Nothing good ever happens to that family. But one day, Charlie finds money and he brought a chocolate bar. He found a golden ticket inside. He and 4 other children are brought to Wonka's factory where there many unusual things happen. This film is one of the better films on my list. The acting was tremendously good. I never thought that Johnny Depp could play Wonka as well as Gene Wilder in the original. Burton did a good job directing this film. Danny Elfman did a great job composing a momentous score. This film is for all ages, but little children might find this movie a little scary. I rate this film a 10/10."
"dbdumonteil","9","5","9","3 December 2006"," between heaven and hell
","I haven't watched the first version supposedly mixed of ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" (1971) dismissed by Roald Dahl and so I will eschew any comparison with this long-anticipated cover directed by Tim Burton. I watched it a few days ago and the first thing that comes to mind about it is that Tim Burton's version is a wonderful example of how the adaptation of a book for children for the silver screen can be transcended into a stylish, prime rendering. Anyway, when I heard that the filmmaker of gems like ""Edward Scissorhands"" (1990), ""Ed Wood"" (1994) or ""Sleepy Hollow"" (1999) planned to give a fresh cinematic rendering of Roald Dahl's work, I thought it was highly likely to be a triumph by any standards. The novel alchemy of these two authors worked wonders to deliver a ""Burtonian"" film to the core. From film to film, the filmmaker pursues his exploration of the strange with these offbeat characters who are generally outcast and the inclusion of the whimsical in the everyday life.<br/><br/>To make the 5 little lucky children visit the coveted dream factory, Tim Burton's imagination is in full swing. It's visually a feast for the eyes with a succession of quirky, fanciful moments fraught with oddball ideas and bathing in an ocean of colors. It is pure rapture that is prevailing in the viewer's mind who is sliding in pure wonder before so many used visual, thoughtful effects and devices to deliver a solid portion of dream and escape.<br/><br/>""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" also ensures continuity with Tim Burton's precedent works because analogies can be found with several of his previous films. A town with many houses and shops gathered and at the edge of the city, a somewhat isolated, mysterious place where lives a bizarre outcast who generates fascination among the inhabitants. Doesn't it remind you of ""Edward Scissorhands""? Moreover, the machinery system could be an echo of Edward's inventor's. Then, if the town has realist British accents in its architecture, Charlie's house seems to be built in a Gothic one and Tim Burton's taste for Gothic trend stands out once again after having come to the forefront in ""Batman"" (1989) or ""Sleepy Hollow"". The interior of the house includes amusing details: Charlie's grandparents spend most of their days in a big bed. At last, the end of the film is similar to ""Big Fish"" (2003) insofar as it showcases the lack of communication between Wille Wonka and his father and their reconciliation.<br/><br/>To come back to the story, the audience is caught in a jaunty walk behind the walls of the chocolate factory just like the visitors and however, this state of bliss seems to be short-lived. This place has something ominous like a big haunted house from which one couldn't escape with its long corridors and spacious rooms. Something the viewer feels when the visitors are at the threshold of the firm with the mechanical dolls singing and dancing before finally being burnt. This fanciful, almost fictional world conceal doubtful, unnerving parts, beginning with Willy Wonka himself. Under his wry, laid-back appearance, this character has an eerie part of ambiguity. He is cut off from the exterior world and barely worries about the unfortunate fate of the 4 smug young imps and one can fuel doubts about their mishaps: were they premeditated? Finally, Willy Wonka has to come to terms with the demons of his past to be in peace with himself and to be a human being.<br/><br/>Of course, as a whole, one could object that the form tends to be favored over the contents with a rather linear master plan especially with the installments concerning the four pretentious brats who are punished of their own sins but Tim Burton keeps his distance from the moralizing, stereotyped aspects of the storytelling. ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" is also a tale that shelters emotion and tenderness mainly brought on by Charlie's grandfather.<br/><br/>The cast is equal to the sum of the story and its treatment. Johnny Depp who had already acted in a so-so movie dealing with chocolate, ""Chocolat"" (2000) by Lasse Hallstrom can be once again grateful to Tim Burton to have conceived him a tailor-made role for him in which he's constantly fit in.<br/><br/>All you have to do is to sit down and savor a well-rounded delicacy from a connoisseur in storytelling who added one more canonical contribution to a monument (a figurative sense for his filmography) that cuts a fine figure. Go on like that Mr. Burton! Would Roald Dahl have appreciated this bracing result?"
"zsanctuary","8","5","9","29 January 2006"," Good morning, starshine... the earth says hello!
","Over the years Tim Burton has shown time and time that he has a knack for dark and morbid movies. He's also shown that he's not afraid to do something a bit different. Just look at Ed Wood; it's a movie about the worst director of all time. Or Mars Attacks? That was actually based on a series of trading cards. So why the hell is this guy doing a remake? Well here's the thing; he's not.<br/><br/>Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is NOT a remake of Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory. It's actually an adaptation of the original novel. The only problem is that the Gene Wilder version is a cherished classic and one can't help but to make comparisons.<br/><br/>The film's plot follows the same basic path as the previous version while also including things from the novel that couldn't have been done before (the squirrel room for example). For those who don't know the story is basically it's about Wonka the famous candy maker inviting five children to his factory for a tour where they are picked off one by one through their character faults. The plot really doesn't hold many surprises if you're familiar with the first movie and even fewer if you've read the book but that's always the case with adaptations/remakes so succeeding in other areas of film-making is a prerequisite for success.<br/><br/>Luckily this film does succeed on many fronts. The most notable strong point would be the visuals; they're marvelous but not from a technical standpoint. In fact I say that the CGI is rather clumsy most of the time and you don't believe the effects for a second but the way these effects are used is breathtaking. Simple things such as the Bucket home are highly stylized with trademark Tim Burton flair. I was also quite impressed by the many different rooms in the factory which each sported a wonderfully unique look. Most impressive of all would be the room with the chocolate waterfall. Along with great set design we also have clever green screen effects which are used to duplicate actor Deep Roy hundreds of times per shot. His dance numbers are an extra special visual treat complimented by unbearably catchy songs.<br/><br/>Well now that I've mentioned Deep Roy's songs I might as well comment on the film's other music. It's dark yet cheery and used perfectly. I'm not kidding either, if this film got anything right it's the music. It might not be perfect but I have so many tunes stuck in my head from this film that I can't help but to commend Danny Elfman for his fantastic work.<br/><br/>Ah and now for the big question: how's the acting? People may argue that it's not very important in a film like this but I've seen Cheaper by the Dozen and I can't bear to see those kids running around in a Tim Burton movie. I'm happy to say that all the kids do a great job as do their ""parents"". Of course I doubt many people went to this film to see children and no-name adults perform (well except for Christopher Lee in a great role as Wonka's dentist father); no they came to see Johnny Depp as Willy Wonka. I personally found his performance to be a mixed bag that mostly leans to the genius side. He's definitely no Gene Wilder but then again nobody is and the fact that Johnny Depp doesn't just crumble under the pressure shows that he is a very talented man.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp actually plays it very smart by acting in a manner that is much different than Gene Wilder yet he's still playing the character of Willy Wonka. He's sort of a creepy game show host mixed with a bit of Michael Jackson (though I admit I only think that because of the obvious resemblance). I was actually quite impressed with this character even if he's played a bit too much like a comedian. I suppose the extra coldness to him even provides a bit more of a reward in the end.<br/><br/>Charlie in the Chocolate Factory is a wonderful family movie that is just as likely to appeal to adults as it does to children. I'm not sure if it will ever become a classic like the Gene Wilder version but it stands on it's own as a really great movie and to be honest that's a lot more than I was expecting.<br/><br/>My review from Frider Waves: http://friderwaves.com/index.php?page=charliechoc"
"jeffcour","2","5","9","4 January 2006"," Bad acting, bad remake. Go rent the original.
","Skip this horrific remake and rent the original. It had far more class, charm, better performances, and vibrant energy from its cast with rousing, memorable songs. You see, that's what happens when you rely on ACTING and DIRECTING and CREATIVITY instead of special effects. This new one belongs in the garbage heap with the rest of the recent CGI-animated pop-culture trash. <br/><br/>In this new film, Tim Burton has sucked the life out of the chocolate factory, and put it all into computer graphics. That said, Christopher Lee and Deep Roy are decent, and Johnny Depp tries his best to breathe some life into into his character (which is quirky and at times funny), but this dull, thudding remake of the original is so full of sneering, boring, sullen, plodding, snotty performances from the dregs of a supporting cast...it sucks! Each snotty spoiled brat is dutifully trotted out to screw up in Willy's factory and meet some horrible fate...and then the hundreds of clones of actor Deep Roy's Oompa Loompas come out and sing totally unintelligible songs. Willy Wonka keeps yelling at the ""TV kid"" to ""Stop mumbling"" ...and yet every song the Oompa Loompas sing is garbled gobbledegook. I felt embarrassed for Christopher Lee, Johnny Depp and Deep Roy. You don't give one rat's butt about the rest of the cast. I haven't seen a worse group of actors in a long, long time. Perhaps Burton was hoping the CGI would save them? Each scene is delivered with such a lack of enthusiasm and energy, I almost couldn't believe it. <br/><br/>Skip this shlock, and go rent the wonderful original with Gene Wilder as Willy Wonka."
"sdeelite","2","5","9","3 January 2006"," God Awful!
","What can I say about how incredibly bad this movie was?? Everything about it was just wrong and even mildly offensive...the ugly oompa loompa (as people have mentioned, one ugly little man computer generated into many), Johnny Depp's creepy and weird interpretation of Willy Wonka (I'm not obsessed with Michael Jackson but you can't deny that there are serious similarities including that femininely creepy giggle of his), Danny Elfman's really bad songs (which is weird because I normally love his composing), and the whole back story to Wonka's childhood--completely unnecessary; more character development for the kids could have been used in that time. But that's no surprise given the fact that the plot in general was all over the place and almost sloppy. To top it all off, the pace of this movie is slow, which is odd for a story that has so much going on. <br/><br/>Basically, the whole movie just rubbed me the wrong way and by the time the credits rolled I was certain that I hated it.<br/><br/>I have liked some of Tim Burton's previous work (as well as Johnny Depp's) and though I pretty much knew it wasn't going to live up to the original (and realized it would definitely be darker with Burton at the helm), I never imagined it would be this bad. It's dark and twisted (not in a good way) and just plain creepy with no real heart and charm. When people start making jokes about cannibalism in a ""kids movie"", I think it's pretty safe to say you should head for the exit.<br/><br/>That being said, there were two good things about this movie...one was the boy who played Charlie...probably one of the few actors here that had any genuineness and charm at all....and the sets and special effects. Visually this movie is stunning in parts, but that certainly doesn't save it. Not by a long shot. It is the reason I give it a 2 instead of a 1 however.<br/><br/>If you love the original film like me, save yourself and DO NOT WATCH THIS VERSION. You'll be kicking yourself in the end...I am."

Roal Dahl should be proud. Johnny Depp as always is excellent and play a great Wily Wonka. The original is brilliant but I find the second one to be far more what Charlie and The chocolate factory should be. Gene Wilder will always be Willy Wonka Just as Micheal Keaton will always be Batman. But this film has to be one of the most fun and well put together of this year.

","Don't mind about the trailer,which is quite ridiculous indeed:this is Tim Burton's best movie since Edward Scissorhands and Batman Returns.<br/><br/>Roald Dahl's unforgettable novel is faithfully brought to the screen,as we see poor boy Charlie (Freddie Highmore,much more cheerful than in Finding Neverland)winning a trip inside the local chocolate factory. And it is an AMAZING factory:almost entirely built from scratch,with limited use of CG,it's a pure and simple visual joy,reminiscent of when the director gave cinematic life to Gotham City. Along with Charlie there are four other kids,perfectly played by the young actors.The only problem is the obnoxious, TV-obsessed Mike Teavee (fitting surname, huh?),who's even more boring than in the book,the only character you really hope will get in trouble. The Oompa Loompas,all played by the same actor,Deep Roy, are very enjoyable,even in the musical numbers,not really necessary ,but charming (they're voiced by Danny Elfman,whose score is terrific as usual).<br/><br/>This really is a Tim Burton movie,and you notice that from the beginning:the snow falling down and even covering the Warner Bros.logo,the camera moving inside the factory,which reminds of the opening sequences of Batman and Edward Scissorhands,the thrilling music... He's even made it more personal by adding an interesting back-story involving Willy Wonka and his father(a welcome return to creepy characters for Christoher Lee). Which brings us to the real reason you watch this movie,the amazing chocolatier...Johnny Depp! He's not acting, he IS Willy Wonka,and he's obviously enjoying himself,portraying someone who's twice as mad as Jack Sparrow,sorry,I mean,Captain Jack Sparrow.Depp and Burton working together is always a guarantee of quality,and this fourth collaboration of theirs is a perfect return to the weird,slightly Gothic movies that made us love them,after their recent,and rather good by the way,mainstream efforts(Big Fish and Pirates of the Caribbean). Don't get me wrong,children can watch,and love,this film,but it really is something everyone should enjoy,no matter how old they are(actually,when I saw the movie,there were only 4 or 5 kids,and 20 adults).<br/><br/>I haven't seen the original movie with Gene Wilder,but thanks to Tim Burton and Johnny Depp,this version is already a classic. I'm really looking forward to seeing Corpse Bride and any other movie they might make together.<br/><br/>Batman Begins aside,this is the best film of summer 2005."

Johnny Depp like always gives a tremendous performance as Willy Wonka, he was funny and dark at the right times which gave extra depth to the character. Like many of the Tim Burton films there was a quirky element throughout eg, making the Bukett house look like it was slopping so there for everything seemed to be on a tilt. he also (which i have to praise him about) got rid of the hideous white/orange/brown Oompa Loompas and brought in the wonderful Deep Roy, who did a good job by playing all of the factory workers. Overall i think this film was excellent and recommend that everyone should see it even if they didn't like the book or don't like the actors i assure you that you will be leaving the cinema or switching the television of and wanting chocolate!"

I have tried to think of something I really didn't enjoy about the movie but haven't been able to think of a thing. From old to young audiences will enjoy this romp through the factory. I take nothing away from the original or Gene Wilder who have kept us entertained for years, but Depp has really brought Willy Wonka to life.

"thisisshe","9","5","9","20 July 2005"," Depp and Burton give depth and excitement to Wonka
","Goth kids and women everywhere united in one voice when it was announced that Johnny Depp was going to be playing the well known Willy Wonka in a movie directed by Tim Burton. Calendars were marked and people were ready to see the successful team of Depp and Burton redefine movies again. As the date of release grew near some people I talked to were getting nervous. Would Depp go too far? Is such a thing even possible? Still, I went out the first day of release ready to see what the verdict would be and if the expectations were set too high. <br/><br/>As the beginning credits roll we follow chocolate being made by sophisticated machines with Danny Elfman's music setting the pace. We meet Charlie first, a normal kid who's day ends with cabbage soup every night with no complaint, is played by Freddie Highmore, who stared with Depp in Finding Neverland in 2004. He does a wonderful job playing the sweet boy who makes the best of his family's low social status. The sets have Burton's hand on them, with the slight cartoonish feel to everything we see. This continues when we meet the other children who will follow Wonka on his factory tour- Augustus Gloop( Philip Wiegratz) with his rosy complexion and chocolate smeared face; Veruca Salt( Julia Winter) her blue eyes glittering like her mother's large ring under the attention of the cameras with her prize; Violet Beauregarde( Annasophia Robb) has the cool blond hair matching her white skin giving her this cool, unemotional attitude and Mike Teavee( Jordan Fry) with his eyes taking over most of his face as though he's watching everything but with a very unhealthy dose of skepticism. The children all did an amazing job personifying their bad traits and I was very happy to have more about Violet than in the 1971 version. Burton gave the children their moments to shine just as much as Charlie, which I thought was missing in the earlier version.<br/><br/>Depp as Wonka was perfect. He gave the character a little more depth, a man who made candy but didn't even like children. The flashbacks to Wonka's childhood made more of Wonka than a crazed candy maker giving him layers and ideals behind his love of candy. The children and Wonka seem to be at odds the moment they enter the factory but being as Wonka hasn't had human interaction in years, it isn't out of place. His sayings and quick wit responses to the children may not make as much sense to the younger viewers but parents will appreciate them. Wonka's sidekicks, the Oompa Loompas ( played wonderfully by Deep Roy) were the perfect compliment to Depp. The songs and dances, different from the 1971 version, all had a different theme and attitude which added to the difference between the children and their faults. These dances were without a doubt some of my favorite scenes in the whole movie.<br/><br/>In the end, you have to forget what you know about Willy Wonka and Charlie and the factory. Forget the happy-go-lucky Wilder character and indulge in a new and more faithful version of the story. The acting was all amazing, the sets were colorful and made you unsure of where to look next, as a trip to a real Wonka factory would have been like. Depp has created another memorable character along the lines of Jack Sparrow and with such a supporting cast, this movie makes a great treat for anyone."

"solexes","9","5","9","18 July 2005"," Not a remake - stands on it's own
","As a young boy growing up in the 1980's I got to see Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory (WWATF). Of course I fell immediately in love with the movie. I can remember begging my parents to rent it from the video store so I could watch it again and again. Then imagine my surprise that I learned there was a book out by the same name! I checked the book out of our local library and was amazed at how different the stories were. I was about 12 when I read the book, and loved every minute of the book. I then checked out the sequel, Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator. I was even more amazed at how bizarre that book was. I learned to appreciate the two separate entities (the book and the movie) as works that stood on their own. It never entered my mind to think of one as being dependant on the other.<br/><br/>Last year when I saw the trailers for Charlie and The Chocolate Factory (CATCF) I was shocked at the outcry from the public. The ruining of Gene Wilder's performance seemed to be the motivating force for these comments. I could not understand, and still don't understand why people see this movie as a remake of the previous movie. It isn't a remake of the 1971 WWATCF - it's a remake of the BOOK. That being said, I am not going to compare this version to the book, I'm going to compare it to Â– itself and the 1971 movie.<br/><br/>My reasoning behind this is simple. The only movie to get to about 90% accuracy on the book was the Lord of the Rings trilogy. Each movie is over 2 hours in length and there are three of them. That's a lot of material. Of course a LOT of the material that was in the books was left out, otherwise you'd be watching each movie for over 6 hours at least! Our society is not a book society. Therefore I'm reviewing this movie with and eye to the 1971 version.<br/><br/>****SPOILERS AND REVIEW DO NOT READ IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE MOVIE!**** One can't help to compare this film to the other, but the comparisons add to the fact that this movie is a stand-alone. It does not follow the book exactly, but closer than the original film.<br/><br/>I gave this movie and initial 10 on my rating. Then I thought about it, and dropped it to a 9. I'll explain why later.<br/><br/>This movie, in my own opinion, is a much better visualization than the 1971 movie. Lets face it, WWATCF was great for it's day, and I'm not disputing that, I'm disputing the vision of the director. This one was visually more interesting. The house that Charlie and his family live in was very - well - pathetic. We, as normal people, all realize that any building in reality would be condemned and that you would get very sick eating nothing but cabbage soup every day. But the deplorable house, with snow outside the gaping hole in the roof next to where Charlie sleeps, is just pathetic enough. Not enough for them to be living under a bridge, but JUST above that position.<br/><br/>The chocolate factory exterior was much grander and more desolate in it's grays. The interior is much more whimsical. You could see the scope of the size of the factory from the entrance. My thought was ""wow - a lot of people must have worked here."" Grandpa Joe was played admirably as the tottering old man of the family who wishes he could just once get another look at the place he worked.<br/><br/>My only - and ONLY gripe with the movie - the reason it got a 9 was the acting by the parents and the children. When the children were in danger of demise - the parents looked shocked - but not very scared. More along the lines of ""I can't believe my child was this stupid."" Case in point - Mr. Salt. When his daughter is being ravaged by wild trained squirrels - and he just watches. Any parent worth his salt (pun intended) would have been over that two and a half foot barrier in a second to rescue his child! The ONLY kid who seemed scared and concerned about his own fate was Augustus. The pathetic ""HELP"" as he disappears from sight in the chocolate machine actually made me concerned.<br/><br/>None of the other children - even Charlie seemed overtly concerned that these kids could be DEAD! Wonka - (Johnny Depp). I can't say enough about Mr. Wonka. He was just as reclusive, anti-social, whimsical, and real as I could have wanted. He had no idea how to act around children. He had no idea how to act around adults. Talk about eccentric! There were a few moments after some of his comments when everything got quiet - and you could feel the tension. No one knew how to react. Just has it should have been. To steal a line from Dr. Evil ""Ooooh - this is awkward."" THAT is what Wonka is to me. He plays the socially inept genius that LOVES candy perfectly.<br/><br/>One can't help to compare this film to the other, but the comparisons add to the fact that this movie is a stand-alone. It does not follow the book exactly, but closer than the original film.<br/><br/>Overall I loved this film, and will be seeing it again in the theatres."

","I admit that I went to the theater with apprehension, having grown up with the Gene Wilder version of Roald Dahl's wonderful story, but I was soon transported into a fantastic film that exceeded almost every expectation. If you are a fan of the book (meaning that you have read the book more than once), you owe it to yourself to see this cinematic version. They say ""don't judge a book by it's cover"", well I say, don't judge a film by it's leading actor, or previous versions that you may have seen of the same story. Johnny Depp is no Gene Wilder, but then this is not Gene Wilder's film. Johnny Depp is Willy Wonka, and that is all that really matters.<br/><br/>There is a subtle sub-plot that was invented for the film which I found a little disturbing, but even with this addition the film was still very enjoyable. I'm not going to give anything away, but suffice it to say that the added material only goes to enforce the morality story that is the main thrust of the original book.<br/><br/>The last Tim Burton/Johnny Depp film that I saw was ""Edward Scissorhands"" and I must say that I was more than a little worried about Tim Burton's handling of this joyous material. Again, I was overly worried for no reason! The colors are bright, the characters are played to perfection by the young cast, and Johnny Depp gives a stellar performance as the mysterious, slightly screwy candy man.<br/><br/>""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"" was a great film for the 60's, but there were limitations to the technology of the day. For a technologically fantastic film that more closely follows the source (albeit with one glaring, disturbing plot addition), I would highly, and exuberantly (is that a word), recommend this film!"

Also worth noting, the visuals were great.<br/><br/>Initially, I wasn't too sure what the point of the slightly divergent storyline was (you'll know what i mean) regarding Willy's past, but it all comes together quite well.<br/><br/>The only drawback for me were that the Oompa Loompa song's weren't that great and a little convoluted, but i guess the originals tended to wear thin after awhile too.<br/><br/>Don't let the idea of ""remake"" stop you from watching this.

","Tim Burton has redeemed himself with this interpretation of the classic story by Dahl. He has put together a group of talented and charismatic performers who bring out the spirit of the original story and enhanced it with amazing production values. Yes, it's different and at times, it feels odd, but it contains a good message which it delivers in quite an entertaining manner.<br/><br/>The beginning is reminiscent of ""Edward Scissorhands"", introducing us to Charlie's family and setting up the big scenes to come. Freddie Highmore's Charlie Bucket is a sensitive and quite mature youngster who has been raised with good values by two generations of his family. They echo the strong family relationship of ""The Waltons"", and Burton makes sure the early scenes display both sweetness and uniqueness. These folks might be honest but they are also very interesting to listen and look at.<br/><br/>The early segments also introduce us to the other four children who play important roles in the development of the story, and it's a hoot to see some of their introductions. Here's when we first encounter the twisted sense of humor that connects the rest of the film and makes the experience in the factory a true delight.<br/><br/>There are moments in the factory scenes when Burton appears to be trying a little too hard; however it is the originality of his approach, coupled with some of the most incredible art direction presented in a modern film that makes the film a treat. There are a couple of musical number that would have inspired Busby Berkeley.<br/><br/>He might not be the main reason the film succeeds, and yet his performance is once again a triumph of the amazing talent Johnny Depp has. His Wonka is to put it mildly ""odd"". His speech and his facial expressions captivate, repulse, and hypnotize at the same time. He commands the screen and easily fits into this wondrous universe.<br/><br/>Be ready to enjoy the ride and appreciate that Hollywood is capable of creating magic. Here is a film that justifies big budgets and respects the value of good source material. Depp, Burton, and Hightower are names that Oscar should keep in mind at the end of the year."

Freddie Highmore is delightful: charming, lovable, and adorable; he a Depp have wonderful chemistry. All the children are wonderful, I was especially enchanted by Julia Winter, who did a perfect Veruca Salt. Charlie's family was great, and Grandma Georgina was hilarious with her random remarks. Having Christopher Lee in it was wonderful, and he and Johnny Depp work so well with Tim Burton films. This film was unbelievably Tim Burton-ish, with burning puppets and an extraordinary melting chocolate palace. The Oompa Loompas were fabulous, and their songs, straight out of the book, were catchy, a treat for the eyes.

His character Willy Wonka is done based off of Mr.Depp's expertise as an actor to create how to portray Willy Wonka.

Overall the film had a bright and cheery visual look that contrasted with Burton's dark little extras. The scenes within the chocolate factory closely matched the book's description and were alive with loud contrasting colors. Each bad child character, (i.e. Varuca Salt, Mike Teavee,) was wisely cast with some sort of grotesque physical aspect that matched the character's flaws. The only addition to the storyline was Willy Wonka's father, and it was played well by making him a dentist who found candy useless. Moving at a much faster pace than the 1973 version, Burton's version is an enjoyable interpretation."

I went into this and wasn't disappointed. I'm not kidding, I laughed so hard, the only times I wasn't laughing was when I was listening to the lines delivered by Depp. Depp gives an awesome performance. It is just what the books meant him to be, crazy. He very much reminded me of Mr. Rodgers. All the kids were great. The directing is awesome. How could you expect less of him? The sets and everything is magical you just get absorbed into this movie, and you believe everything he tells you. Now to the music. I was worried when I heard the Oompa Loompas sing, but when I heard it was based off Dahl's lyrics, I wasn't worried. They were hilarious and the Loompas were great.

Willy Wonka is suppose to be about imagination, hope, and mystery.<br/><br/>The music lyrics were inaudible at times and not in your face like the original.<br/><br/>There isn't any ""oompa Loompa Doompa de do"" with fun loving oompa lumpas. Instead the oompa lumpas are cold faced clones with a cheesy special effect. There isn't any personality to these little guys. And they certainly are not cute in anyway.

High voice with girl-like laugh, emasculated face and hair, old guy trying to act and be like a child. Hell, even the parents of the kids are continually weirded out by the nut-job they portray Willy to be.

I am positive kids will not get the intended message.

"locoowl","2","6","12","10 August 2005"," This is a poor remake or a great original film
","While the story line in this version follows Dahl's story closer than the Willy Wonka movie, but it lacks the energy and characterization of the original film. Tim Burton's Wonka is a neurotic runaway child, not the creative and eccentric Wonka in Dahl's story. Burton apparently got wrapped up in the Wonka character, because no one else in this film has any life. The children are cardboard cutouts who either have no real energy or overact when they are not being wooden. Grandpa Joe's character suffers the same fate & Charlie's parents might as well not be in the film at all. Burton tried to make up for this with elaborate sets & all kinds of gadgets & special effects, but those cannot overcome wooden performances and lack of direction.<br/><br/>I said this version followed the original story more closely than the original. However the addition of the byplay being young Willy and his father (who is not in the book) is merely distracting and does not help the story at all.<br/><br/>I am sure Burton felt the rock 'n' roll Oompa Loompa's would be a hit, and I assume the lyrics they sing were in Dah;'s original sorry (I could not understand the lyrics since the music was so loud). But the pithy ditties created by Anthony Newley and Leslie Bricusse in the original were much better and added much more to the story.<br/><br/>Bottom line: a flashy remake which does no justice to the original."
"harry_tk_yung","Null","6","12","26 July 2005"," A visual feast
","(watched in Richmond, B.C.)<br/><br/>Those who have seen ""Willy Wonker's Chocolate Factory"" will likely remember the hauntingly creepy tune that the Oompa Loompas chant repeatedly as the bad kids got their undoubtedly well-deserved punishments. No argument that this is after all a simple children's story but there are certain things, maybe just abstract feeling, that suggest a dark side.<br/><br/>The updated version (kid hooked on video games instead of TV, for example) replaces the name Willy Wonker with Charlie and in the process, as suggested by some critics, rightly changes the emphasis from the mysterious, or perhaps even sinister Willy Wonker, to the true focus of the story, poor and family loving Charlie. These critics then also suggest that while overall, the chocolate factory has been made to look and feel less ominous, the character of Willy Wonker has been deliberately designed to remind you of one Michael Jackson. Bringing the five kids into the factory would then take on another dimension, even if only subliminally. You be the judge.<br/><br/>The simple story line remains unchanged. Five lucky kids find in their Wonker chocolate bar golden tickets for a tour in Willie Wonker's Chocolate Factory which was closed to all visitors suddenly overnight some years ago. Charlie is the hero while the other four kids are living specimens of how rotten a kid can be brought up to be, thanks to their misguided and misguiding parents. In the end the bad kids get what they deserve, and so does Charlie.<br/><br/>For the same old story in the hands of Tim Burton, with today's technology, you would have certain expectations. Those expectations I would say are generally met. This very story gives Burton the best ever opportunity to indulge in his passion for colours and shapes, as the factory provides perfect legitimacy for the most extravagant and outrageous visual scheme he has in mind. If you remember, some of his play with colour and shape looks somewhat unnatural in ""Edward Cissorhand"". But inside the chocolate factory, you won't even dream for a second of questioning the validity of any visual display you see, however strange it may look. Come to think of it, it is almost as if the chocolate factory story is written for the very purpose of a Tim Burton film.<br/><br/>For casting, Burton brings together again Johnny Depp (as Willy), his favourite lead, and Freddie Highmore (as Charlie) who played so well against Depp in Finding Neverland. And, as in many of his movies, Burton has a role for his fiancée Helena Bonham Carter, this time as Charlie's mother. We also have Christopher Lee playing a just-a-little-more-than-cameo role of Willy's father.<br/><br/>The movie is first and foremost a visual feast. One great moment for me is hearing a suggestive hint of Richard Strauss ""Also sprach Zarathustra"" and then finding indeed the familiar scene from Stanley Subrick's ""Space Odyssey: 2001"", but with a Wonker chocolate bar impersonating the mysterious slab!"

That is some of the criticisms I have to give for this more recent adaptation.<br/><br/>Hey, jon-750, you were hoping that Tim Burton will never do a ""remake"" again, but, to disappoint you, he is. This time he's doing Lewis Carroll's story Alice in Wonderland. Even though he will be moving away from the mood of this movie, he will be doing the same type of thing he did in this movie, and he will use CGI effects in it too like what he did here too.<br/><br/>I have to agree that Tim Burton has been the same in recent years, just making adaptations and things based on other stuff as well as casting Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter in it too, as far as I can see. I wish Tim Burton would take them out and put more different people in rather than a few because some might end up getting bored.

""Hey, let's see if we can make more money off of Willy Wonka"" I hate to cut down a movie like this but it's in my all time top 5 bad ones.<br/><br/>Why? Bad, Bad Bad! I Don't know where to start, they really flushed this one down the toilet. I like Tim Burton, I like Johnny Depp, I've liked everything I've seen Christopher Lee in also but this, eeek! First of all what is with the face make-up? This is Willy Wonka Folks, Not Michael Jackson.<br/><br/>He just wasn't likable either! The character development on him didn't work, it was several minutes of un-needed film. It didn't help the movie.<br/><br/>His bit about cannibalism: Not Funny His bit about his old factory employees: Not Funny I may as well prepare myself for this one because I know that someone out there is reading this comment and thinking ""But, they tried to follow the book with this one"".<br/><br/>Okay, they did the chocolate palace and the squirrel bit and therefore they get credit for ""following the book"". The movie still sucks! They took a classic, a family-oriented masterpiece and royally messed it up. I don't care what they ""followed"" it just wasn't good this time around.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp should have quit after reading the script to this, I've seen him do so much better before.<br/><br/>While we're at it why don't we re-do the Sound of Music with Brittney Spears as Maria von Trapp. Wait, never mind, forget I mentioned that. Just my luck, someone will probably do that.<br/><br/>Gotta give this one a 2 0ut of 10 just for casting, the kids good performance and for a few funny bits. The rest of it is really painful to watch."
"praetoria","2","4","7","2 September 2005"," Saw it for free, yet still feel ripped off.
","I remember being a fan of the original movie. Granted I was about five when I saw it, but it seemed to be a fond memory. I wish I could have left it as that. All I wanted to see was painted dwarfs singing the Oompa Loompa song, but instead we get a cloned midget Mexican doing theater.<br/><br/>As a homage to the original:<br/><br/>Oompa Loompa Doopeety Doo, This movie was worse then sitting in poo, Oompa Loompa Doopeety Dee, Rather than seeing this again I would drink my own pee.<br/><br/>My friend got me free passes to this movie, and I still felt compelled to ask for a refund. Complete and utterly boring. No redeeming value what so ever."
"Wonderkind","6","7","15","3 August 2005"," Candy wrapped in gold foil
","Sumptuous. Delicious. Vivid. Open up the wrapping and you will find something dark and unusual but still incredible. This film boasts yet another amazing performance from Johnny Depp, portraying quirks we never got to see in the last make of the Roald Dahl classic. There is almost an expression of wicked joy in his face as he watches the children slowly be eliminated to leave our hero, impoverished Charlie Bucket. Helena Bonham Carter et al provide a somewhat surreal and obscure view of Charlie's life and childhood. The directing and imagery in this film are bold and captures the childlike sense of wonder and fun associated with a chocolate factory. Inevitably, there is a moral hidden between all the good bits. Somewhat heartwarming, never does this film get too sickening. Indulge yourself."
"nate-145","1","11","27","15 July 2005"," Freaky and Scary - Bad Film
","First of all - I think IMDb needs to trash the first 7-9 pages of user comments because those are obviously mostly people who are being paid to promote the film. Now in the later pages we're getting the true comments or so it seems.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp completely botched the role of Willy Wonka. Willy Wonka was never intended to be a weird hermit. Willy Wonka was supposed to be the rich, wise,affectionate uncle you never knew you had. Willy Wonka was the Walt Disney of Chocolate. He was the Clarence from It's a Wonderful Life, the guy who says the right thing at the right time. He's the Candy Man. He is the Wizard from the Wizard of Oz. He is the benefactor who makes all of your dreams come true because he, unlike the rest of the world understands your heart even though the world cannot see it. Blessed are the poor in spirit, for they will inherit the kingdom as the beatitudes say.<br/><br/>Bottom line: Depp completely missed the mark by portraying it like Michael Jackson, a man who cannot relate to kids or people in general. Depp did a splendid job in Sleepy Hollow and Pirates of the Caribbean but he clearly did not 'get it' with respect to this film.<br/><br/>Also to note: The German glutton kid had no eyebrows. Satan in The Passion of the Christ also had no eyebrows. Either way it is scary and just wrong for a film like this. <br/><br/>The homage to Edward Scissorhands as the doors was a cool throw in if you caught it. (As the ribbon to the factory is cut, Depp is clearly Ed Scissorhands once again.) I'm not sure I understood the reference to Disney's Matterhorn Bobsled ride as they rode the glass elevator. It was clearly Disneyland's Matterhorn complete with climbers bearing in bright jackets like Disneyland.<br/><br/>All in all, while this film had some funny moments, it completely lacks the charm and wonder of the first film. My advice is that this film goes to a quick and well deserved death in the graveyard of bad films with big sets. Save 9 bucks and go see the Real Willie Wonka ... Gene Wilder.<br/><br/>Nathan"

"jukierubixcube","1","5","10","27 July 2006"," Burton didn't like the first one? Well, I hated his.
","I was highly disappointed! When I think Tim Burton, I at least expect creepy or something. There were more noticeable effects than the first one! The entire story was rushed. In the first ten minutes of the movie, everyone had a ticket. I didn't even hear the two guys with the dogs talking about the Russian guy who won a ticket because the focus was on how ridiculous their dogs were in size. The rush of people trying to get the ticket from Charlie in the original were maybe two people trying to buy it in this version. Please. AND I didn't like seeing what happened to the other kids at the end. That just takes away from it all. When Willy Wonka says ""They're unharmed"" in the original, that's all we needed.<br/><br/>The girl who played Veruca couldn't hold a match to the original girl! She wasn't intimidating at all! And what was with Johnny's Stepford Wives smile? Was that supposed to be eerie? And don't get me started on the songs! They were obnoxious and so poppy. The Oompa Loompa song was repetitive, but I never dreaded when they started singing it. It was classic! Don't modernize everything.<br/><br/>And the magic was gone. Like I said, it was rushed, so when Wonka opened the doors to the candy world, it was just like ""Here it is."" The crescendo of music didn't even make it magical! In the original, it's always awe-inspiring, no matter how many times you watch it.<br/><br/>I'll give him this: the storyline between Wonka and his father, that was sweet how they reunited in the end. And Charlie looked very pitiful when he chose the factory over his family. I liked those twists with him at first saying, ""I'm not going. Someone offered me 500 dollars for the ticket...We need the money,"" and the one at the end. I liked how they put the house in Wonkaland. That was nice. The only parts I found really funny was when Mr. Salt gave Wonka the business card, and he threw it away as quickly as he handed it to him, and when Wonka crashed into the Wonkavator the first time. The second was not as funny, but I chuckled. Those were the only good things about the movie.<br/><br/>Come on, now. If you didn't like the original, Mr. Burton, you could have at least created a BETTER version. That's usually what directors strive for. Seriously."
"c-m-church","1","5","10","6 April 2006"," The worst remake since ""How the Grinch Stole Christmas"".
","This is a classic example of a good movie turned into something else. The original 1971 version was magical, inspiring and a film you would remember for the rest of your life. This however was just an opportunity to score a quick buck off a movie that nobody could possibly hate. When kids see this instead of the original version, their going to like the remake and not like the older version. Gene Wilder's performance in the 1971 version was some great acting that was simply flawless. He played Willy wonka like he had actually been running a chocolate factory. When Jonny Depp played Willy Wonka you could tell that he was getting paid to do so. Jonny Depp looked just as bad and Childish as Micheal Jackson. I hope no kid buys this movie and without watching the original. If your kid buys this movie (Which I Do not recommend) make sure you rent them the 1971 version. Before you even think of seeing this movie, watch the original. This is not a movie you need to see. Trust me, it's a movie you will regret watching. I would of liked this movie if they had'nt turned a great fantasy movie into an embracing kid comedy. They could of at least tried to make a good movie here, but they were not after people like me. They were targeting idiots to watch this awful movie. Watch the original it's a great movie. Don't watch this movie."
"jboothmillard","6","5","10","5 September 2005"," Charlie and the Chocolate Factory
","The was the second adaptation of the great children's book by Roald Dahl to be made, to rival or replace the musical Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory starring Gene Wilder. Director Tim Burton (Beetlejuice, Batman, Edward Scissorhands, Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street) sticks directly to the source material, e.g. no golden egg laying turkeys, they have squirrels like they should, and the correct Oompa Loompa songs, music and and vocals Danny Elfman. Anyway, basically, a chocolate factory in the town Charlie Bucket (Freddie Highmore) lives is sending out millions of chocolate bars worldwide, five of them contain golden tickets. One by one the tickets are found, and eventually, Charlie gets his. This ticket takes him, Grandpa Joe (David Kelly) and the other finders into the magical world of Willy Wonka (in his fourth Tim Burton film, Golden Globe nominated Johnny Depp) and his chocolate factory. Obviously all the nasty kids go one by one. Fat and greedy German Augustus Gloop (Philip Wiegratz) up the chocolate tube, gum chewing Violet Beauregard (AnnaSophia Robb) turns into a blueberry, spoilt rich bitch Verruca Salt (Julia Winter) chucked down the garbage shoot by creepy squirrels, and telly loving Mike Teevee (Jordan Fry) is shrunk by the TV laser. Also starring Helena Bonham Carter (Burton's fiancÃ©e), Noah Taylor as Mr. Bucket, Missi Pyle as Mrs. Beauregarde, James Fox as Mr. Salt, Deep Roy as Oompa Loompas, and narrated by Live and Let Die's Geoffrey Holder. Three things I will say are different, but do kind of help the story, the flashbacks of a prince getting a chocolate palace and the Oompa Loompas, and the story of why Willy Wonka is kooky, and interested in candy making. It was nominated for the Oscar for Best Costume Design, it was nominated the BAFTAs for Best Special Visual Effects, Best Costume Design, Best Make Up/Hair and Best Production Design. Good!"
"davidshooting","2","5","10","7 August 2005"," 10 reasons why Burton's version was a failure
","How much have the studios paid for this film to receive uniformly good reviews? Despite looking forward to going (being a fan of both Burton and Deppe) this really is turgid fare. Do yourself a favour and buy the DVD of the original!<br/><br/>1. no moral basis for the film: Where the original had something to say to children and parents alike about how to treat each other Burton's version had nothing but glossy visuals. Charlie has to pass a test in the original that is only resolved at the end. No such test in Burton's - he just wins with some half hearted loose instruction tacked on the end about family being important... <br/><br/>2. dramatic urgency where the original conveyed the whole world's excitement over the race to find the 5 Golden Tickets with wit and immediacy Burton's version was flat and soulless<br/><br/>3. Charlie and his family the original family were intimate and humorous. In it's determination to avoid treading the same ground we lost the closeness between Charlie and his grandfather and the emotional momentum that made us care for Charlie and root for him.<br/><br/>4. Lady Luck Not only did the original have suspense, but it made us think about the nature of luck. It ensured that not only was Charlie's good fortune believable but that his eventual triumph was not about luck at all but about Charlie demonstrating that respect for others and goodness of heart is what leads to happiness and success. No such lessons in Burton's version!<br/><br/>5. Performances The performances in the original were uniformly excellent. In Burton's they were just uniform. As excellent actors as Freddie (2005 Charlie) and Deppe are they, alongside the other actors, were as one dimensional as Burton's duplicated Oompah Loompah's. Anticipating every flagged dramatic turn they sucked the lifeblood out of the film. Nothing was surprising in Burton's version - no matter how many times they did whizzy things with glass elevators. Deppe's Wonka, as bold as it was, was funny for 5 minutes. Once we got it there was no room for the character to develop so it died a death thereafter.<br/><br/>6. Music The original score and lyrics were clear, catchy and contributed to the story. Burton didn't give a fig for Dahl's desire to impart wisdom - instead he tried to ingratiate himself with the adult viewers by giving us pop references in his Oompah Lumpah numbers which did nothing for the story and only put us on some unnecessary tangent.<br/><br/>7. Structure The original was linear, clear and concentrated on developing character and story in tandem. Burton's version tried flashbacks, moral justification/explanations for Wonka's sweet obsession. Not necessary. Wonka isn't Batman. Burton should have learnt from the sweetshop owner in the original. When asked why does Wonka do it he simply replies: Do you ask a bird why it flies? It does what it was born to do. No further exposition required.<br/><br/>8. Script One of the first lessons in scriptwriting is that action is always more interesting than reported action. Don't tell us something, show us! The first ten minutes of Burton's film relies on exposition. Lazy scriptwriting. The original covers the same ground in half the time by showing, not telling.<br/><br/>9. Timing This film was ripe for a remake. The visuals of the title sequence left me ready to love the film. Unfortunately it nosedived into an irretrievable tailspin - Burton missed a fantastic opportunity to put his name right up there with the greats. He remains a brilliant but flawed director. A tragedy for Deppe who rarely misses but who cannot perform without some sort of direction. <br/><br/>10. Art direction does not a film make Where was the wit, humanity, soul? Come on you corporate studios - if you're going to take an all time classic book as your inspiration you have no excuse. Fancy visuals are alright for the Fantastic Four but what we want is to laugh and cry. If you're going to make a killing at the box office the least you can do is make us feel something."

","Burton is NO genius and he's proved it again. Depp's performance was odd and stale. Unsure of a specific way to speak makes watching him very uncomfortable. Look, DeNiro would make an awful Ace Ventura and Depp makes an awful Willy Wonka. Most people saw that before the movie was released. The children's performances were roughly the same. You could replace the personalities in each child and you wouldn't know the difference. Veruca's behavior was the most disappointing. You end up hating Charlie's Grandfather more than her!! On it's own, it's not bad, if you compare it to the book it's pretty decent, if you compare it to the '71 release than it's superior in technology and movie making, but falls short in magic and overall experience.<br/><br/>4 out of 10"
"tourettes424","1","10","25","16 July 2005"," As I had Suspected
","I found this movie to be a horrible remake of the movie, Wonka's 'catchphrases' were not amusing. If a child went to see this who has never seen the old one, then I believe they would enjoy it. But to anyone who loves the old one, Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, I believe you will find this remake horrible. Johnny Depp reminded me of Michael Jackson in this movie. The oompa loompas were Mexicans that are the size of your ankle. But the story line was altered. This movie made me bored, and I wanted to walk out.<br/><br/>Although, as far as a children's movie it was fine. Tim Burton, I think, was trying to alter it make it less weird for the children of today to understand. The original one was more designed for teenagers. This is just in my aspect. The original had 'scary' things in the tunnel and Willy Wonka came off as creepy more than weird.<br/><br/>Final decision, if you have a child who has never heard of Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, go see it, the kids love it. However, if you have watched the original thousands of times, do not go to this movie.<br/><br/>Thanks, there is my 2 cents."
"tedg","Null","9","22","21 July 2005"," Wonky Kubrick
","Burton has a single note that he imposes. Fair enough. But its like Gilliam, he has to find a very rare story that has slots where has something to offer. For Gilliam, that was ""Fear and Loathing."" Burton last was in his element with the second Batman.<br/><br/>For my taste, this was all wrong for him. His talent is the ability to separate layers of reality cleanly and then playing with the dissonance between those layers, often humorously.<br/><br/>This story has only one layer. It is along the lines of a Suess, and may be the best Suess on film. As a Suess, it has some charm, but why settle for seconds? Bad script.<br/><br/>But this has one cool moment where Burton leaves his Burton-dom and enters the world of Rodriguez. Its a twist on the film within. Wonka transfers a chocolate bar through the TeeVee. It is a many layered reference to 2001, which itself is about conflicting generation of reality. <br/><br/>The scene features the white room, the eye, the music, the chair, the apes, and the chocolate bar as the monolith. What's on the TeeVee and movie screen are overlapped as our hero can reach in and grab the bar.<br/><br/>This segues into a sequence populated by rock band parodies, including The Beatles. All these are peopled by the Oompah guy and voiced by the Oingo Boingo guy. Its an island of depth in the midst of a sea of stupid syrup. <br/><br/>Otherwise, the project is a misfit.<br/><br/>Oh and Helena's bearing is majestic. Great to have her there.<br/><br/>Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements."
"jminklei","2","6","13","16 July 2005"," Disappointing
","Perhaps die-hard Burton and Depp fans will find this remake worth watching. I expected a family film, and found a dark interpretation of the Dahl children's book. Depp seems to have found his inspiration for Wonka in Michael Jackson and imitates him almost perfectly - down to the falsetto voice, glasses, and gloves. This Wonka does not like children or their parents and has bizarre flashbacks to his own unhappy childhood (not in the book). Some of the special effects are noteworthy but overall, this is not a happy film. The boy who plays Charlie is a bright spot in this dark film. If you are into goth, Burton, and maybe - art films? you may be satisfied. For me the spirit of the novel was violated and a lot of money was wasted on another remake."

Also, Johnny Depp doesn't fit the part perfectly, in my mind he is a little too young for it. Also they tried to make the movie more comical then it should be. I did enjoy the old movie very much and I was looking forward to a new remake. But when i saw the new movie, i was disappointed with its unsimilarity to the old movie. Overall this movie was not as great as the old one but is good for a family with young children to see. Little kids seemed to be enjoying the movie."

But Johnny Depp as Willy Wonka made this movie practically unwatchable. Every scene that he was in, I couldn't wait end. Gene Wilder was an odd, witty, likable eccentric, Mr. Depp on the other hand was distant, pretentious and uncomfortable to watch. Unfortunately the brilliance he gave Jack Sparrow was entirely missing from his portrayal of Willy Wonka. Charlie Bucket and Veruca Salt on the other hand were very fun to watch, too bad their characters couldn't save this sour remake."
"flicklover","6","7","16","17 July 2005"," Johnny Depp nearly sinks the film!!!!
","I am a fan of the original 1971 classic. I went into this film not expecting to like this version better, but I was open to be pleasantly surprised. When a classic move is being redone, as seems to be the norm these days, what one would expect is to be reminded of what made us like the 1st version. Tim Burton seemed to be the perfect director for this film, and in many ways he is. The film is visually inventive, but not jawdroppingly so, I would say that the look of the film is only bigger in scope than the original, not better. Obviously it takes cues from the original film, and yes, it seems to follow the book more, which is not necessarily a good thing.<br/><br/>The biggest problem for me is Johnny Depp. At first it seems that he would be perfect to play Willy Wonka. He goes for total weirdness here, His Wonka is more annoying than anytrhing else. Depp is a great actor, but he makes Willy Wonka to robotic and unlikable. He is creepy at first but never dangerous. Just weird. Gene Wilder had made Wonka into a 3 dimensional character. He was funny, quirky, gentle, and at times creepy, but he made him more or less a likable character. This film wants us to sympathize with Wonka, but I found him to annoying to care. Depp created a caricature, not a character. The rest of the film is fine. Freddie Highmore as Charlie is good, the supporting cast is good too. There are some funny reworkings of the originals scenes, some work, some don't. If one sees this film without having seen the original, I think that it would probably be more enjoyable without the comparison. I'll stick with the Gene Wilder classic! Grade: C+"

I wonder if Burton hopes that Depp will come back into fashion, despite him not being any good.
I mean, it seemed for a minute that he might come back, as he was enjoyable as a secondary character in the first 3 pirates films (until the series got it wrong by making him the main character in the terrible fourth one that nobody liked).<br/><br/>Maybe Burton thinks if he keeps making films with the same visual style, and starring the same people, enough times that he might accidentally recapture Edward Scissorhands.<br/><br/>Having said that, Ed Wood was good, so maybe this approach worked. Once."

This movie actually makes me sad to see the lost opportunity and missed potential. <br/><br/>Depp should have known better than to make his character so flat and lifeless. Willy Wonka should have been played larger than life, not like a dull, effeminate, slightly snippy waiter. <br/><br/>After Planet of the Apes and now this garbage, I swear to never watch a Tim Burton movie ever again.

"TheBlueHairedLawyer","1","3","5","10 May 2017"," Another one of Burton's campy and creepy train wrecks
","This film was released in 2005, when I was in the 2nd grade, and my father took me to the army base theatre in my neighbourhood to watch it. It was targeted at children, but I just didn't get it and still don't get it even today. It was heavily predictable for one thing; Burton casts Depp in everything and as usual Depp comes off as a creepy freak who would be better as a pedophilic mime in a back-alley somewhere waiting to pop out from behind a dumpster, than a lovable and eccentric factory owner. He terrified the hell out of me as a child and still makes me cringe even today. The CGI is incredibly tacky. To be fair most of the child actors did a good job, but their scenes are always overshadowed by Depp's annoying and sometimes cruel behaviour towards the characters. He loves children a little too much at times, other times he seems repulsed by them. His mood swings implied a mental illness, not creativity or genius. And as usual, Burton never passes up a chance to slip his wife, Helena Carter, into a role, also very predictable and obvious. Many of Burton's actors are very typecast.<br/><br/>By far aside from Depp as Wonka, what irked me the most was the godawful musical numbers. Cross Lady Gaga with Michael Jackson, the Rocky Horror Picture Show, American Horror Story's ""Freak Show"" (Season 4), and Stephen King's It from the 1990's, and this film is about what you'd get. It was corny, bizarre, like the worst acid trip available. There's also a backstory thrown in for no apparent reason, maybe just as filler, which tries to give Wonka a tragic backstory of child abuse. This just comes off as incredibly silly. He acts like he has PTSD over something traumatic, but when it's revealed that his father loved him but was a dentist and simply didn't want Wonka to eat candy because he was wearing a retainer, it just makes Wonka's character seem even more spoiled and intolerable. I mean, he freakin' runs away from home over his father not letting him eat a Halloween chocolate ball? Somebody needs to grow the f*ck up in this film, and it's certainly not the kids or their parents. Actually despite the parents portrayed as meek enablers and bumbling bumpkins, they were all very likable for the most part. Their parenting skills may have been questionable but none of them seemed particularly bad, whereas Wonka sings and dances cheerfully as a little girl is shoved down a rubbish chute with a rotten fish skeleton? What the hell? Oh, and let's not forget the vulgar humour slipped into this film aimed at child viewers as well, with lines such as ""don't touch those squirrel's nuts!"" ...Ugh, that's just stupid.<br/><br/>All in all, I hated this film as a kid and I hate it even more today. I've found though that it does serve at least one purpose... ever play the Willy Wonka Drinking Game? You pop this film into your VHS or DVD player, you gather up a group of friends and some vodka and shot glasses, and throughout the film, each time a person says ""what the f*ck?"" while viewing, they have to drink a shot. Otherwise, this film, at least in my humble opinion, is good for nothing but landfill stuffer."
"greg-e-porter","1","3","5","27 July 2016"," I wouldn't say that Charlie and the Chocolate Factory holds up as a standalone movie, let alone a remake.
","Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is Tim Burton's 2005 adaptation of the book with the same name. Just watching the opening credits, in all it's dated (even for 2005) graphical glory, you can see the names appear on the screen: Helena Bonham Carter, Johnny Depp, music by Danny Elfman. We got the whole Burton crew here, boys, let's rumble.<br/><br/>Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, if you've seen the '70's Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, is largely what you'd expect; the reclusive candy-man Willy Wonka has announced that he will open his mysterious factory to the lucky children who find the several Golden Tickets hidden within chocolate Wonka bars.<br/><br/>Let me just start off this brief review to say that I wouldn't recommend this movie. I didn't enjoy the songs, the characters, or the stylistic decisions. I couldn't help but compare it to the original which I've seen countless times. The first portion of the movie is mediocre enough. It looks kinda like a Wes Anderson movie (he directed The Grand Budapest Hotel and Moonrise Kingdom) but more black and white checkerboard. But as soon as Johnny Depp comes into mix, everything takes a sharp downward turn.<br/><br/>You know how sometimes, especially with action movies, the hero eclipses the rest of the movie? It doesn't really matter about what is going on because we get to see the hero kick butt. For example, at first, there was Terminator and then shortly thereafter, there were Schwarzenegger movies. It doesn't matter who Schwarzenegger is fighting as long as I'm along for the ride. This works with Tim Burton now that I think about it; there was Nightmare Before Christmas and now we have Tim Burton movies. It doesn't really matter what's going on as long as I get to see some whimsy.<br/><br/>Now, with Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, we spend a decent amount of time establishing this whimsical movie about a poor boy named Charlie but, once Depp is introduced, the focus shifts to him. If any movie should be called Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory it should be this one.<br/><br/>Depp's representation of Willy Wonka makes me really uncomfortable. He seems to be channeling Michael Jackson but, doesn't the whole pedophile thing color this in an odd way? I mean, Wonka is inviting half a dozen children into his mysterious wonderland for a contest for which only he knows the rules. Sure we get to see Wonka's backstory (to explain his childlike nature) but that juice ain't worth the squeeze. I was attempting a more candy oriented phrase, but that's all I could think of. <br/><br/>I have pages of moleskine notebook notes about what I didn't like about this movie and why and how but, then, last night I re-watched Ratatouille. I'll go into more details about the plot but, for our purposes here, the main villain in Ratatouille is a food critic named Anton Ego.<br/><br/>At one point he says, ""In many ways, the work of a critic is easy. We risk very little, yet enjoy a position over those who offer up their work and their selves to our judgment. We thrive on negative criticism, which is fun to write and to read.

There are plenty of movies out there and even plenty of fun bad movies. I can even see having a fondness for bad movies (even if they aren't fun). That said, I'm recommend avoiding Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. If you want some whimsy, why not go to watch one of Tim Burton's older movies?

","Johnny depp's portrayal of willy wonka was like watching Michael Jackson on an unending LSD trip, sporting the voice of a Christian televangelist's wife. He bumbles through the storyline, seemingly clueless and inept and lacking all self-awareness- a tragic child-man who vomits into his own mouth when compelled to use the words ""family"" or ""parents"" - a stark contrast to the sublimely wise and insightful character portrayed by gene wilder, who drew lines from famous works of literature to draw home didactic points to those wise enough to listen. Depp's Wonka is motivated by some dark, nightmarish past, by a father who not only abandoned him for eating candy, but took the entire apartment complex with him. Poor character portrayals, interspersed with songs so blatantly bad one hopes, even as you hear them, that they will be utterly forgettable. The fact that the soundtrack makes the lyrics difficult to discern thankfully helps in that regard. <br/><br/>I liked nightmare before Christmas and believe Tim burton has talent, but watching the repetitious motifs/moods/tones of his movies is like watching George Lucas futilely churn out Star Wars episodes 1 and 2, and wondering how episode 4 ever came from the same formulaic mind. <br/><br/>I sadly wish I had never seen this movie. It's pedophilia undertones and creepy portrayal by Depp have marred the original forever for me."

","This film tells the story of Charlie Bucket, a child of modest origins who wins, thanks to a golden ticket, the possibility to visit the wonderful chocolate factory of the eccentric industrialist Willie Wonka, whose story is also told through the film, which focuses action in Charlie's journey inside the factory, along with five other children and their parents. The child who reaches the end of the visit can get a prize, but each one has a weakness that will be tested in each room. The result is a series of accidents involving children, who yield to their weaknesses and vices, being readily assisted by their parents and workers of the factory, the Oompa Loopas.<br/><br/>This film was based on the children's novel by Roald Dahl, which already has an adaptation to the cinema dating from 1971. Anyone who has read the book or watch this movie with attention quickly notice that there is a didactic purpose behind the story. All children except Charlie, showed a character flaw, a vice or wrong behavior, and the ""fate"" of them is just the result of failing to resist it (two had addictions - television and chewing gum - one was greedy and another was so spoiled that no one could contradict it). Most children's stories have moral grounds and lessons to be learned, it isn't new and proves its character as a children's tale.<br/><br/>I think Tim Burton, director of this film, conceived it in a mistaken way. This movie seems too adult for a children's story and, at the same time, it seems too childish for a teen audience. So it ends up in a ""middle ground"" between them, a fact that wasn't positive. No one questions the qualities of Tim Burton, who has accustomed the public to great but eccentric films. However, his vocation isn't the children's audience. He has made animated films (""Corpse Bride"" is the most notable example) but they were all directed for adults or adolescents. And this is a children's story, that would have been better in a children's movie. Maybe someone at Disney Pixar can make a good adaptation of this tale."

I believe that those extreme efforts which were put in to make this movie thoroughly unpredictable from the very beginning actually spoiled what could have been a brilliant tale. I went watching this movie only because i like Johnny Depp's acting skills a lot but soon i realized that any good movie isn't just made up of highly skilled actors or strong line up of charterers, instead it's an art of story telling that not everyone can master. every exquisite cinema is the eye-craft of an equally brilliant director. This one turned out to be a totally senseless-hopeless cinema for me."

","OK, true this film does have a certified fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes, and currently a 6.9 on IMDb. However it seems that everyone on the internet hates this movie. Why? Because it isn't as good as the 1971 film Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory. It seems that that film was one that should not have been remade. Alright, let me make this clear, I LOVE Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, it's a classic, I've loved it ever since I was a kid, and it still holds a special place in my heart. But it is a terrible adaptation.<br/><br/>I didn't get around to reading the book till long after I saw the original movie. However when I did I found out that that film had changed a lot, and I mean a lot. This film, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, follows much more closely to the book. Charlie's father is still alive, the songs are more closely related to the books, they have squirrels and bad nuts, and more. Now true the film does have two big problems with it.<br/><br/>One is that Gene Wilder was a much, much better Willy Wonka than Johnny Depp. The other is the subplot involving Wonka's father, this was never in the book, and seems out of place since the book is supposed to be about Charlie. But overall the movie has the same message as the book, as the original film did too.<br/><br/>I can't decide which adaptation I like more, Willy Wonka is more nostalgic for me, while Charlie is much closer to the book. I love them both, but I can't deny that this film is much much closer to the book."

","Although Gene Wilder's Willie in 1971 was genuinely creepy, Johnny Depp's is pretty skin-crawly itself, coming very close to a Michael Jackson impersonation in this tale of a fabulously wealthy Peter Pan entranced by his childlike dream of sweet-tooth omnipotence. At one point, one of his child-victims asks, ""Why is everything so pointless?"" Yeah. <br/><br/>But then again, maybe it's not so pointless; maybe it's more of the tired, piddly indoctrination Hollywood loves to run on us. It has all of that community's favorite villain/stereotypes (and love/hate obsessions): Germans, blonde Southern women and avaricious WASPs. Even that ol' bugaboo - the American military - is represented by the preteen video-game abuser.<br/><br/>Director Burton needs to retire the ""dark holiday"" motif, at least, find better music than the tinkly, minor-key monotony here. And speaking of dull, why don't the characters show at least a little wonder at rivers of chocolate and fantastical machines? To a person, they react to Wonka's wonderland as if they're shopping for shoelaces.<br/><br/>This is for people who truly hate children, and prefer them, as W.C. Fields opined, ""properly cooked."" Not sure what the message is (unless tormenting ""mean"" kids IS it), although I kinda liked Deep Roy as the Oompa-Loompa multitudes. And the cast, including the amazing Depp (who based his character, evidently, on Carol Channing) is first-rate."

He is very annoying and trying far too hard to seem eccentric. It was very hard to watch for me. Everything about this movie tries far to hard to achieve something it just could not. Using one actor for all the umpa Lumpas was a big mistake also. Freddie Highmore is great but the casting for the rest of the children was awful.

Sure, Gene Wilder's Willy Wonka had a bit of a distinct dark side with him making sarcastic comments of ""oh no"" whenever one of the kids got into danger and him never showing any real care for their safety, but Johnny Depp's version of Willy Wonka is right out sadistic. Not only are the kids put into massive danger(we are made to believe one of them is about to be incinerated.) but while they are being harmed and humiliated the Oompa Loompa's sing their(so horrid it makes you want to cut off your own ears) songs with the soul reason of taunting the victim.<br/><br/>Sure, the Oompa Loompas always sang, but it was AFTER the kid had already come to harm and it was also AFTER Willy told everyone that the kid would be just fine. Also, the songs came across as, well, you can learn something from this incident.<br/><br/>BUT in this version the Loompa's are taunting and mocking the kid AS they are in danger. And the harm off the child is multiplied by ten. Let me paint you a picture of one of the scenes.<br/><br/>Violet turns into a giant blueberry, but as she transforms(and she gets 25 times bigger then she should) the Oompa Loompas sing their song, as she is screaming, ""Help! Someone help me! AHHHHHHHHHH!!!"" And then the Oompas don't just role her out. They jump on her and move her with their feet like she was a barrel. All the while well she is still screaming in horror and while the whole time Wonka is nodding his head to the beat of the song.<br/><br/>The whole scene was so utterly disturbing that it made me sick. And I kept on saying to myself, ""this is a kids' movie?"" Though the film is rather funny in spots, it's just to dark for its own good. That, and Charlie isn't nearly as likable as he was in the original, and Wonka is just right out creepy.<br/><br/>Plus, wasn't Grandpa Joe SUPPOST TO BE BED RIDDEN!

","The original ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"" is one of my all-time favorite movies. I knew there was a very slim possibility that I would like the remake as well or better, but I gave it a chance and watched it with my kids... and I absolutely hated it. I am stunned that people like this movie. In the original, one of the best things is the wonderful music. Who can forget the song Gene Wilder sings in the chocolate room, or the opening song in the candy store, or Grandpa Joe and Charlie singing ""I've Got a Golden Ticket""?... these are only three of the many great songs that enrich the 1970's version. In this new film, however, the only songs are those that are sung by the Oompa-Loompas after each child's demise, and, ohhhh... how incredibly stupid and annoying those songs are. Johnny Depp's performance as Willy Wonka made me want to vomit. And the thing is, I normally love Johnny Depp. I think he is one of the most talented actors out there... but he was awful in this movie. I totally agree with the people who are saying he reminded them of Michael Jackson. Creepy and irritating. The absolute worst was the ditzy valley girl way in which he said, ""Kay?!"" after each command given to an Oompa Loompa. The kid who played Charlie was okay... one reason why I gave this movie a vote of 2 instead of only a 1. But I sure did like the original Charlie better. In the original movie, I cared about Charlie a lot more. I liked the attention that was given to the development of his character, what with the scenes at his school, or when he is peering longingly into the window of the candy shop, or the touching scene at his mom's work. There was none of this depth in the new movie. The hour and a half that I wasted watching this movie is an hour and a half of my life that I can never get back! All I can do is warn other people... if you haven't seen it yet, you aren't missing anything... don't waste your time!"

So, it was a total discovery for me and I am unable to tell which deserves to the previous works from what have been brought by Burton or Elfman.<br/><br/>The title says it all, except than the visit is conducted by a ""Jackson""-ian figure, Willy Wonka (his relational problem with his father must be very close to the ""disorder"" of the famous singer).<br/><br/>Maybe because I saw the Imax version, thus paying more attention to details, this movie is a wonderful melting-pot of the universe of Burton. Like all excellent filmmakers (Spielberg,Â…), you got the feeling that Burton is driven by the same motives that he focus movie after movie.<br/><br/>First, the attention paid to colors, to stylish props, his unique way of filming buildings and sets will give you the same good vibes you felt watching ""Beetlejuice, Batmans, Edward, NightmareÂ…"".<br/><br/>That's for the eyes, but Burton is a real artist, because he addresses also the consciousness. He has a hard teeth against the American middle class, which is shown here in cynic way. Not that he doesn't like these people, but I think he has to make a point against a certain void in their life.<br/><br/>At least, the music of Elfman is excellent, as usual. This time, he hits in all styles: Big orchestra, chorus, songs, guitars.. At the second musical show, I was happy because it sounds like the good old days of Oingo Boingo. Thus, I was waited for the next shows with impatience.<br/><br/>In conclusion, a very good movie for all the family"

In the original you really felt sorry for Charlie and his family but this film didn't convey the situation very well.<br/><br/>The acting in the film was good but it really lacked the magic that the original had.

The problem I have with Charlie and The Chocolate Factory is that it seems to have lost the charm it once had. In the original you felt like you were transported into another world when entering the chocolate factory, but this time around it all feels synthetic and way over the top. <br/><br/>For the love of God, I can't understand why they would use the same actor for the oompa Loompas. They were once interesting, but now just plain creepy. The actor they use is a creepy old Indian that looks Like your common sexual predator. Is Hollywood getting that lazy that they can't use more than one actor to play parts. Secondly the music sequences are just plain awful and once again creepy. I'd rather have my kids (if I had them) watch a graphic horror movie than this puke colored nightmare. <br/><br/>Well, you'd think that would be bad enough, but you can't forget Willy Wonka. What once was a lovable character is now a Michael Jackson clone. A germaphobic feminine looking man lures kids into his magic paradise with promises of a big surprise. Does this sound familiar? Thank God the parents were around. <br/><br/>The flashback scenes would have been decent if they didn't interrupt other parts of the movie you were getting into to. Fortunately the kids were pretty accurately portrayed compared to the original, but they couldn't save this mindless film that has captured the imagination of movie goers who've forgotten the greatness of the original. <br/><br/>There's so much more I could complain about, but it's just irritating thinking about this movie. I suggest for anyone who enjoyed the original to stay clear of the remake. I sure wish I had. Many people will say, well it's more based on the novel than anything.

","I know that the 1971 musical was unfaithful to the book, but I did much prefer that version to this well-intentioned but somewhat disappointing effort from Tim Burton, the director of Batman and Edward Scissorhands, and this adaptation was in some way more unfaithful in spirit than the 1971 film. The film does have some lovely sets and inventive visuals, the boat scene is fun if not as much as in the Wilder version, a great job is done with the Veruca Salt/squirrel scene and I liked the performances of Helena Bonham Carter, David Kelly and Freddie Highmore. But I was disappointed with Johnny Depp as Willy Wonka. He just lacked the charm and grace Gene Wilder brought to the character, and I don't think Roald Dahl intended a characterisation that was more Michael Jackson than Willy Wonka. Some of the cast overact, especially the girl who plays Veruca Salt, even for the character the spiteful spoilt brat act was way overdone. I liked the music score by Danny Elfman which is filled with whimsy and appealing oddballness(I much prefer his Edward Scissorhands and Nightmare Before Christmas scores however), but the Oompa Loompa songs were rather annoying with none of the noisy melodies memorable and were shot like a music video. Tim Burton evidently tried to make the story darker, and in some respects to the book, it didn't quite work. A good example was the case of the additional character of Dr Wonka, as much as I like Christopher Lee, and he did perform well, but his character was unnecessary, and the script with some over-explanatory narration lacked the sparkle of the 1971 film consequently. The grandparents did bring some comedy, and the movie does start off well. But the unfaithfulness of the last half, meant that the whole film felt rushed and lacking in charm and magic which the Wilder had aplenty. 6/10 Bethany Cox."
"RuthAkien","1","4","8","18 September 2006"," The worst adaptation of a book, ever!
","Firstly i resent what some of the other reviewers have said about people who don't like this movie; that the only reason we don't like it because we can't get over the 1970's film. Well i thought the original movie was OK but would have liked it to be darker, and therefore more like the book which i loved. I came to this film expecting to love it but instead i was extremely angry because...<br/><br/>A lot of Wonka's lines are completely out of character, there purely for cheap laughs. you'll notice them when he says something the contradicts his actions/motivations- something stupid that ISN'T IN THE BOOK.<br/><br/>of the clichÃ© ending with Wonka's father and the back-story relating to this (also NOT IN THE BOOK). Which raises the the point of why Wonka would want Charlie not live or have contact with his family anymore (perhapse Charlie should have asked if Wonka also has the same policy on social services!). In the book Wonka has no problem with Charlie's family living in the factory and so provides the emotional resolution to Charlie's early life of poverty and want, even though he will clearly have weird dark adventures as a result of this (as it should be). <br/><br/>This film wasn't any darker than the original it just made less sense due to poor writing. The book was dark because the character of Wonka is dark; he finds it FUNNY when nasty things happen to nasty kids (a reaction most people wouldn't have; i.e. no empathy), he's done lots of dangerous previously unheard of things, he reacts and thinks like no one else (his reactions are actually similar to those of someone with a psychopathic personality disorder) not to mention that he is essentially auditioning these children (which is dark in itself). If Burton wanted this film to be darker than the 1970's one he should have emphasised Wonka's actual character not made up new stuff that doesn't make any sense!<br/><br/>Although there were a lot of things i didn't like about this film it is the poor handling of Wonka's character that annoyed me the most because it made the whole feel of the film different from that of the book. It is this LACK OF FAITHFULNESS to the book and not the re-inclusion of (1)dad working in a toothpaste factory (2)the squirrel room instead of the geese room that i think is important (although i would have liked to have seen the squirrel scene if it had been well executed). I also don't think you can claim faithfulness if you've added a badly written back-story to a main character who is supposed to be enigmatic! If Roald Dahl didn't explain him what gives these people the right to???? <br/><br/>THIS FILM ISN'T Faithful TO THE BOOK<br/><br/>Make no mistake; Roald Dahl would have Hated this vapid sludge and if you want to watch rubbish, then you wont go wrong with this."
"Scarlet-22","4","6","14","20 July 2005"," Pointless. Utterly, Painfully Pointless.
","As a kid, I worshiped the '71 version of WILLY WONKA AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY. I read Dahl's book CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY in one sitting as a pre-teen and shrugged, ""Eh, the movie's better."" When I heard Tim Burton was planning to make a ""more faithful"" version of CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY, I vacillated between ""hey, this could be great"" and ""oh, man, is this going to blow chunks"", with each tantalizing picture and story from the set tipping me one way or the other with distressing regularity. So, on the opening Saturday, I bundled the family up and headed out to the theatres to see which diametrically opposed opinion would win out in my head.<br/><br/>I'm sorry to say, the ""blow chunks"" side won by a mile.<br/><br/>The first 40-or-so minutes of this movie is really amazing, with some of Tim Burton's best ""real world"" visuals ever. It captures quite well the heartbreaking, soul-sucking poverty of Charlie Bucket and his barely-functional family, far better than the '71 movie version does. Grandpa Joe is given a decent backstory (he used to work for Wonka when Wonka had human employees), Charlie has a father in this version who loses his job capping toothpaste tubes (Wonka's contest has created such a demand for candy that the demand for toothpaste rises faster than humans can produce), and they all (Mom, Dad, Charlie, and four bedridden grandparents who share the same bed) live in a ramshackle house that looks as if it would fall over with one really strong breeze. The highlight of this part of the movie is Freddie Highmore as Charlie, whose big eyes and beaming smile conveys Charlie's innate inner goodness to near perfection, and when he is heartbroken over losing his chance to get a golden ticket, you feel your own heart ache...and then you cheer when he finally DOES get one of his own. This young actor's got quite a future ahead of him.<br/><br/>And then, it's time for our five lucky winners to enter the factory. And that's when the film goes to Hades in a handbasket and never recovers.<br/><br/>The blame for this goes around more or less equally between Burton, Elfman (whose score, with the exception of the great ""Willy Wonka The Amazing Chocolatier"" song, is the worst he's ever done), and the writers...but at least some of the blame has to rest on Johnny Depp's hideous portrayal of Wonka, which completely overwhelms the rest of the movie. Garish costumes, bad hair, freaky makeup, strange voice, and weird mannerisms do not a great performance make, and one can't help but compare Depp's version of the character with Gene Wilder's sly, silky, menacing-yet-hilarious portrayal 24 years earlier. Wilder comes out on the winning end of that race by more lengths than Funny Cide at the Preakness a couple of years ago. Wilder's Wonka is a mysterious sort, offering tantalizing glimpses of what's under the surface, a worldly and wise man who has a child's sense of wonder and fun mixed with an extremely liberal dose of adult cynicism. Depp's Wonka is insane, maladjusted, and just plain weird, and the result is off-putting to say the least.<br/><br/>The writing from the chocolate factory onward is HORRIBLE. It's as if the writers abandoned all pretense of their promised ""faithful"" adaptation and instead just threw a bunch of scenes from the '71 version, pages from the book, and bad plots from a random story generator together in a hat and compiled whatever came out the other end. Want a sample of the bad plotting these monkeys with word processors came up with? Wonka's love of candy comes from...get ready...childhood trauma and daddy issues. Really. I'm not kidding. I'll wait while you grab your barf bags before going on.<br/><br/>Elfman's terrible music...well, the less said, the better. I don't care if his lyrics come straight out of the book, that doesn't make them GOOD. What happened to the supercomposer whose grandiose superhero themes made him THE go-to guy for summer blockbusters? Yuck.<br/><br/>But the worst blame has to go to Tim Burton. Once the movie hits the chocolate factory, Charlie--you remember him, the kid whose name is in the title?--completely disappears. It's as if he's just there to fill a frame. If he has a dozen lines inside the factory, I'll be shocked. The rest of the kids are no better (except for Mike Teavee, who is very well played here). Several visuals are stolen color-for-color and prop-for-prop from the '71 movie, except they're not done as well. The ability to use CGI to render things in the factory (165 Oompa Loompas, all played by Deep Roy; blueberry Violet; the candy boat ride) does NOT improve on the '71 version at all. And what a waste of Christopher Lee as Dr. Wonka (Wonka's dentist father, who forbade his son candy because he proclaimed it would rot his son's braces-encased teeth). Like the writers, Burton completely abandons his ""faithful"" adaptation in favor of a ""re-imagining"" ala his dreadful PLANET OF THE APES. The film meanders another 20 minutes beyond its logical ending just so Burton can work some more on his father issues ala the plot of BIG FISH.<br/><br/>By the time the movie does end (it's a REALLY long-feeling 2:20), all I could think of was running home and putting in my DVD of the '71 version to cleanse my brain's pallet. Don't be surprised if you're tempted to do the same. Better yet, save yourself the $10 and rent the '71 version instead. It may be sticky sweet, but it's far better than the nasty, bitter pill that's in theatres now."

As some commentators have said, this is not a movie for little kids. For an intended wondrous, child-like fantasy of this type, where an eccentric larger-than-life candy maker invites five lucky golden ticket-winning children to visit his marvelous factory for one whole day, there were far too many horrific sights and a generally dark, gloomy weirdness to these proceedings. Totally joyless, they even made 'me' feel repelled rather than delighted.<br/><br/>I went to the movie because I like Depp, and I'm a long-time fan of Christopher Lee (who plays Wonka's dentist daddy in flashback sequences). I also have a cheerful wife whose favorite childhood film of all time was the old Gene Wilder version of WILLY WONKA AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY and, to tell you the truth - she's like a little kid herself whenever she thinks of this story. So I wanted to go to this new Tim Burton movie partly because I knew I'd be tickled to see her so happy, as I anticipated she might be - and for what it's worth, she did come out liking this film as much as the older one, sure enough. At least THAT was some kind of solace for me.<br/><br/>Right after seeing Burton's take on Charlie, I dug out my wife's copy of the 1971 Gene Wilder film. I watched it and have come to the conclusion that this new version is obviously done on more of a grand scale, and there were elements of it that worked better than before; but at the same time, the original had more charm and less grimness. Some of the changes I liked better would be: I think the boy playing Charlie is more sincere and pitiable in this 2005 edition, but the neighborhood that Burton has him living in looks like something out of Gotham City from his own BATMAN ('89). I know Charlie and his family are supposed to be impoverished, but their crooked little shack that looks like it's ready to collapse any second is taking it a bit too far. I also liked the new addition of the ""competitive"" girl and her striving mom who seem to have their eye on the ""prize"" as some sort of fierce competition instead of just trying to have a good old fun time. <br/><br/>I liked most of the songs heard in the 1971 version better than the musical numbers in this one, and while the old feature could be pretty mean at times in its own right, it's child's play next to Burton's horrors, and Wilder still made for a more acceptable choice as the unusual candy showman than Depp does. If I were a child, I wouldn't want to be anywhere near Johnny's Willy. For those insisting that Burton's film is true to the Roald Dahl book, I haven't read it, so I don't know. But word on the street from those who have read it say that CHARLIE is not 100% faithful either. But get this -- while watching the 1971 movie, however, I was surprised to learn that the screenplay was written by Mr. Dahl himself -- so, whether completely in tune with the novel or not, I'm taking the Gene Wilder film to be straight from the original author's mouth (and pen). It had his seal of approval. ** out of ****"
"SpaceTracy","4","6","14","15 July 2005"," What happened?
","OK, I love Tim Burton, I love Danny Elfman and I love Johnny Depp, however I did NOT love this movie. I don't know, it seemed so artificial and Hollywood and Willy Wonka was so dismal and odd in a way that I did not care for. I walked out of the movie theater feeling like I had drippy over sweetened goop all over me. YUCK. I think Burton is a little too full of himself these days... I heard Tim say that he did not like the original.. well I don't like his version...thoroughly disappointed.. :-( I guess we all have our own version of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory from reading Roald Dahl's classic and mine is totally different than Burton's idea. Man, it's one thing to not like a movie, but to love a director and actor as much as I do these two guys and to walk out feeling the way I did.. what has happened to Hollywood? Where have all the good ideas gone???"

","Horrible. I saw this movie last night and I really hated it. I wasn't hoping for an exact remake of the great original, and, with Burton directing, I wasn't disappointed in that regard.<br/><br/>I suppose, for me, it was just a bad marriage of director and movie. It could have been good in another directors hands. But Burton makes ...his own style, I guess you could say. He's made some movies I have really liked: Edward Scissorhands, for example. This, his latest effort, just falls flat for me.<br/><br/>Depp is creepy as Willy Wonka, and that's not really what I wanted. I could never get into the character at all.<br/><br/>If this version of Willy Wonka had been the original, trust me it would not have became a beloved classic.<br/><br/>There is simply no way that this movie will be remembered thirty plus years from now as the original one is today."
"alisha-brown","2","5","11","20 July 2005"," Horribly disappointing
","I was really excited about this movie considering that I grew up with the original and thought it was great, plus it had Johnny Depp in it (despite the fact that Tim Burton directed it and music was by Danny Elfman). However, from the opening scene where you see the chocolate being poured into molds and hear the creepy music (which doesn't fit the scene AT ALL), I knew it was going to be bad.<br/><br/>The character of Willy Wonka was pathetic. His character was so weak that it was ridiculous to watch. At least in the original, Gene Wilder's character was written to command the attention and seem strange-but-not-someone-to-mess-with. In the new one, Willy Wonka is an absent minded child with no presence (and what's with the make-up?!). This version of Charlie and The Chocolate Factory also revealed too much about Willy Wonka's past, making him a pathetic man, rather than a mysterious candy maker.<br/><br/>Further, all of the Oompa-loompa's being played by Deep Roy was disappointing and frankly, didn't make sense. The flashback scene to discovering the Oompa-loompas was completely unnecessary and added to the ridiculousness of the movie.<br/><br/>I thought that the characters of the 5 children were also poor. Their characters were more like caricatures and the dialogue so contrived that it made me sick.<br/><br/>I would still recommend watching this film if only to better appreciate the original."
"moviemanMA","6","5","11","17 July 2005"," Roald Dahl would be proud!
","Children's author Roald Dahl has written some of the most enjoyable and most memorable books of all time. Many of which have been made into motion pictures. Matilda, James and the Giant Peach, and currently in progress, under the direction of Wes Anderson, The Fantastic Mr. Fox. Probably one of his most famous stories is that of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. This novel was made into Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory back in 1971. Now comes Tim Burton's attempt at recreating the classic story of how a poor little boy becomes one of the luckiest children in the whole world.<br/><br/>In Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Tim Burton has his friend Johnny Depp to play the role of Willy Wonka, played by Gene Wilder in the original, a man of mystery and imagination who operates one of the most successful candy companies in the world. After many long years of seclusion, Wonka has decided to open his gates once more. He has put five golden tickets into five chocolate bars to be sent around the globe. The five lucky winners will be given a grand tour of the enormous factory. One of the five will be given a prize that is unbelievable. <br/><br/>A boy that lives near the factory by the name of Charlie Bucket (Freddie Highmore) wishes so much to find a golden ticket. He and his family can barely afford to put food on the table. They too want Charlie to win a trip to meet Mr. Wonka. When all but one of the tickets have been discovered, Charlie's chances are looking grim. By chance he finds money on the street and buys a Wonka chocolate bar. All out of luck and his previous two attempts looming over him, he opens the bar to find the last golden ticket!<br/><br/>The next day is the day of the tour. There he meets the other four winners: the portly Augustus Gloop, the spoiled Veruca Salt, the must-win Violet Beauregarde, and the malicious Mike Teavee. These five all seem self absorbed compared to the humble Charlie Bucket. These five are taken on a whimsical journey into imagination, adventure, and of course...chocolate.<br/><br/>What this movie has that its predecessor didn't was more comparison to the story. The movie doesn't focus on the outside world's craving for the golden tickets. It focuses mainly on Charlie's view from the bottom trying to scrape his way to the top. Their is more of an in depth look into the past of Wonka and how his life is impacted by his father (Christopher Lee). But what this movie lacks is a little sanity! Depp is at times a little too zany, and the Oompa Loompa's song and dances get out of control. Although they might seem childish, these parts to the movie are actually good. The compliment the crazy atmosphere of the factory. The songs are quite well done. The score of the movie and music to the songs is done by none other than Tim Burton's music man, Danny Elfman. A magnificent display of wacky music with a combination of heartwarming melodies.<br/><br/>Tim Burton's wacky style is ever present and his over the top display of color and direction are a plus. His creative way of telling a story is what keeps him at the top directors around. Charlie and the Chocolate Factory was much better than anticipated. It's just like a chocolate bar; it is sweet, gets better with every bite, and leaves you satisfied..."

","As a person that appreciates the art of film, I find this monstrosity to be absolutely insulting, I know that I'm on a minority here but while we're on the subject I'd like to point out that the original was FAR from perfect, in fact I rated that a 5/10. The only thing that kept me watching that one was an eccentric performance by Gene Wilder. And the willy works in this one delivered a simply DREADFUL performance.<br/><br/>Let's talk about the characters.
So the main character ""Charlie bucket"" is so bland and doesn't have a personality, in fact he is so bland they could have made him an actor on twilight. Willy works is a difficult character to sympathize with, due to his belief that bad children deserve to be physically punished. Another thing that makes Charlie so unremarkable is that he didn't even WANT a golden ticket, and he doesn't seem to care that ""oh a child just got turned into a blueberry, why should I care?"" Or ""oh, a child just got shrunk and is about to have his body stretched out, no way that will effect his life.""<br/><br/>For the plot, I would like to start out by talking about how needlessly long it was for the children to actually get to the chocolate factory, and when they finally do the plot gets worse and worse. Everyone's main complaint about this film is that there is a needless backstory for willy wonka, but that is far from the worst part of it. The plot simply consists of the first 30 minutes being as dull as hell, as the children find golden tickets, then when they finally get into the factory the only plot that happens is that they go from room to room, making each child more horribly deformed than the last.<br/><br/>This should without a doubt, be in the 100 lowest rated movies on IMDB"

"tabuno","8","2","3","23 January 2019"," A Serious Comedy
","15 July 2005. Tim Burton's version of Willy Wonka is more serious and at times more funny than the original. There are some rather disturbing scenes with squirrels for younger children and some other somewhat nasty, curt remarks while Johnny Depp attempts to provide a background character that has more depth than Gene Wilder. Here the audience gets to experience a historical storyline for Willy Wonka that has a much stronger connection to the ending of the updated version that while risky brings the story full circle in terms of Mr. Wonka's character throughout the movie. The grandparents are wonderful, as if they were lifted straight from the book. The humor is mostly reserved for Johnny Depp with his great use of expression and facial features, his quirky personality. The movie is a difficult balance between a quality, mainstream children's movie and the more odd and strange world of Tim Burton. The balance is sometimes precarious in the movie and not always perfect. The lyrics apparently from the book, using the high energy music that attempt to both keep one's attention and at the same time provide a morality story about bad children is somewhat submerged in the not so easy to understand loud music and hyper-octane of the dancing of the Oompa Loompas. This version is a much different, strong sharp colored rendition with off-putting Wonka dialogue that Johnny Depp or Tim Burton deliberately incorporated into the movie to offer up a much more serious and substantive Wonka and more qualitative ending than the original. For the most part it works, but at times it becomes just more noise and more of the same. Eight of Ten Stars."

The story is about a little child named Charlie. He lived with all of his family who were poor, then Charlie found a golden ticket that will allow him and 4 of the childrens to go to the chocolate factory of Willy Wonka.
I think that movie is great and entertaining. I love the character of Willy Wonka and he's built throught the story. All the others children are selfish and really mean to Charlie so because of that a terrible fate is reserved to them. The lesson of this movie is brilliant it means that if you're a brat life is going to punnish you for it.

","It's taken me 13 years to properly sit down & watch this remake. Having not really been a fan of Johnny Depp over the years, I have to say that this film really doesn't suit him. I don't think he was right for the role at all. But then again, who else would be perfect other than the original Gene Wilder. <br/><br/>I've given this one a chance now & finally watched it (right now in 2018) & I just can't get over how bizarre Depp plays the role: creepy, wooden, sarcastically annoying to the children in the film. His laugh is horrendous & his head-bopping to the Oompa Loompas songs & dances. It's like he's at a concert & he's enjoying it more than the children. <br/><br/>The child actors - I don't recognise one single one & can't say I've seen any of them in anything else. Since this movie was made in 2005 I don't think this film has given them any recognition since we're now in 2018 & you never see or hear of any of them. Whereas the 1971 classic is still there in people's hearts (including mine). The original movie with Gene Wilder still holds conventions around the world where the original actors (Peter Ostrum, Julie Dawn Cole) attend for photo signings but I have to say; just what recognition can one give this 2005 remake. 
The children in this film also show no excitement - no emotion - no laughs or thrills considering they're in a chocolate factory. There's just no engagement & I have to agree with one of the other reviewers on here; watch for the scene when they're in the river boat tearing down at fast speed: the children make no noise of excitement, no screams, no joys. Nothing. <br/><br/>I think the most impressive part of the movie is with the squirrels. I'll give this one credit cause it actually quite impressed me the effects of it. & I think it's trying to show you that squirrels can be quite scary (imagine approaching one yourself & it pouncing on you for attack!)<br/><br/>Can't say I think much of the Oompa Loompas. Never really thought much of Deep Roy (who plays the duplicated Oompa Loompas). 
I met him once at a convention here in the UK & the guy looked miserable as sin, he looked like he didn't want to be there. Most probably because there was nobody at his table wanting an autograph. I tried to say hello but he just barely said one word back. <br/><br/>I'm not gonna say I dislike this movie nor did I enjoy it. I've just got no feeling to want to watch it again. But the original 1971 is always a classic and when it comes to a good egg, I'll be cracking open the dvd to the original anytime!"

","I grew up reading the book, and of course with the original film, both of which I love. This remake is exactly what you'd expect from Tim Burton, it's somewhat dark, trippy, surreal and somewhat garish. Fans of his will love it, appreciate his style, and enjoy his stamp. The special effects are terrific, it's a visual feast, very colourful, so much going on. The supporting cast are super, Freddie Highmore, David Kelly and even Liz Smith are delightful. The original has such a warmth, the music, songs, but mainly Gene Wilder, and whilst I love Johnny Depp, it's the character's lack of warmth that stops it being a movie I revisit often. The music just isn't good, you could watch it twenty times and not remember a song. Way too much Deep Roy. It has its faults but it's still imaginative, bright and very entertaining."

","A young boy (Freddie Highmore) wins a tour through the most magnificent chocolate factory in the world, led by the world's most unusual candy maker (Johnny Depp).<br/><br/>The biggest way this film differs from the original: Tim Burton (or someone) wrote it so the story has a weird obsession with Wonka's childhood. Now, this has some advantages, such as getting a role for Christopher Lee and being able to explain the importance of family, but it does seem to ruin the flow at times.<br/><br/>I liked the new songs. We have a new style of Oompa-Loompa, and they have a variety of musical styles. Excellent. Especially considering how much Danny Elfman was involved.<br/><br/>In some ways, this is closer to the play than the original film, especially with the nut scene. I do not recall how the book goes, but I suspect it may also have the nut scene. All in all, for a movie that is greatly disparaged, this is not nearly as bad as it is made out to be."

","I fear that I'm always running a wee bit behind in both books and films, somehow thinking that after all the talking heads get finished screaming pros and cons, one can perhaps be a little more objective and less caught up in the fray; besides, I have hundreds of films in my personal queue.<br/><br/>Folks still seem to be searching for Gene Wilder in this film, but, amazingly, folks, he's not in it. It's a Tim Burton film, and it stars Johnny Depp and that said, I found it delightful, with an amazing other-worldly universe populated by Charlie Buckets and his fellow kiddie guests. This film, loaded with parodies of numerous other films (including the opening sequence of 2001: A Space Odyssey), is sort of a cross between The Wizard of Oz, Pee Wee's Playhouse and Metropolis, with the Oompa-Loompas standing in for all those robotic types in the latter--but this time they are Latino Lookalikes in dazzling shades of Technicolor candy.<br/><br/>I would personally caution against showing this to very young children, as there are a few revenge scenes that are perversely (though hilariously) graphic, such as the attack of the squirrels who drag a pesky girl to a large, dark hole and dump her in (of course in Burton's world, she richly deserves it, but some kids might find it frightening). As to the cast, Freddie Highmore is an understated delight, and Depp quietly subversive, playing well against expectations. This oddity is a moral little story about goodness which, if you're in the mood for the quirky, can be fun. I think there's room in the cinematic world for both versions of this kiddie classic to exist, don't you?"

","I have been a Tim Burton fan for more than a decade now; I grew up with his films. But what I have been through yesterday his really unique. I actually never thought he would offer us such a film one day. Fans of his first period, with all the lonely and desperate characters won't like it for sure. Since Mars Attacks !, and more specifically since Big Fish, Burton decided to tell things differently. His vision of the world slightly changed in every of his films : now, the rejected freak comes down to the world and stays. A world that remains frightening and weird even thought we call it ""reality"" but a world worth living in. And that's what Charlie & The Chocolate Factory is all about It all begins with a main title sequence that may be one of the main weaknesses of the film. The sequence is very entertaining and visually ambitious but they decided to go with CGI and it looks like it was a decision they made in last minute. Since the film was proudly made with ""real"" sets, ""real"" Oompas Loompas, ""real"" squirrels, the main title looks inappropriate. It's not that important but it's a Tim Burton film and we know how much he usually works on his main title. Hopefully, Danny Elfman is there with a crazy mix of the Edward Scissorhands and Spider-Man (the music when the title of the film appears gave me shivers), a true musical roller-coaster that gives a hint on what his score will sound like through the film."

Johnny Depp plays Willie Wonka and the otherwise gifted actor appears a bit too quirky to pull off the role. He gives a creepy vibe of Michael Jackson!

They almost go so far as to steal the show, and kids will love marveling at the imaginary factory on screen and getting lost in the fantasy. <br/><br/>For older viewers there doesn't seem to be a lot to Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, but glimpses of Willy Wonka's childhood lend some depth to the proceedings, culminating at the end with his confrontation of some childhood issues.<br/><br/>My other gripes with the film were the musical numbers which came across as somewhat contrived, cheesy and unnecessary, if anything they could have been shortened to a minute at most.

I was also skeptical about newcomer Freddie Highcomer in the titular role but all my fears were blown away by this kid. He shows a lot of promise.

","First off, I am NOT a Johnny Depp fan at all. When he bites the dust in Nightmare on Elm Street, I cheer! (just kidding) Also, I'm not sure if what I say about the movie could be considered a spoiler, but I've gone ahead and marked the message as such just to be safe since I do discuss some of the differences between the Gene Wilder version and this one. So, you've been forewarned! In all seriousness, I loved Gene Wilder's version in Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory. But, have you ever wondered WHY the title was changed? It was because Roald Dahl was absolutely against that version of the movie, so they had to change the title. He was angry with how they had changed the story.<br/><br/>I think if Mr. Dahl were alive today, he would have approved of this version, and so do I (and I still like the first one, but not as much as this).<br/><br/>Wonka is shown as aloof in this movie, and he was in the book as well. Charlie does nothing to anger Mr. Wonka as he did in the first movie. I never really liked that since in the book, Charlie always did what was right and NEVER thought about breaking the rules, so that always kind of bothered me in the first movie. Also, Wonka NEVER got angry in the book, but Gene Wilder's character gets SO angry at Charlie and Grandpa, it even scared ME as a child and I thought it was actually pretty mean.<br/><br/>Tim Burton, as dark as his movies usually are, surprised me with the amount of color in this movie. In no way did I feel cheated and all the kids did great. They played their parts to perfection. Violet was just as obnoxious as she was in the book. Veruca was spoiled as ever and Mike and Augustus were just as disgusting as they were in the book.<br/><br/>I think what made the book so wonderful was imagining all those wonderful sites the children saw as well as the Oompa Loompas. Tim Burton has brought those visions to life. Deep Roy playing all of the Oompa Loompas did an excellent job and he probably had the hardest job of anyone in the cast. Where you see multiple versions of him, he had to film EACH one of those parts separately! If you notice, they each move differently and have subtle differences. Kudos to the Deep Roys! I introduced my 9-year-old daughter to the Gene Wilder version about 3 years ago and she absolutely fell in love with it. Any time it was on TV, she HAD to watch it. Then, she went to see Burton's version and she loves that one better than the Gene Wilder version, and she hasn't even read the book yet (I have to dig my copy out for her to read because I KNOW she'll love it!) You're going to have people defend either the Wilder or Depp version, or there will be those like me that like both. However, I feel this is the version that really hones in on Dahl's vision and for that, I think he would have been proud of Burton's attempt. I know I appreciate it."

"The_Orenda","8","2","3","31 October 2005"," Well done performances all around.
","Burton's Charlie definitely strays from the book and the original 70s Willy Wonka, but the casting and superb effort all around add to the intrigue of the movie. This version is much more modern, more hip and more sympathetic to the characters overall. The fates of the children are revealed here as opposed to the original where you could only imagine the worst. Depp's performance as Willy Wonka moves away from Gene Wilder's Mad Hatter persona and we get to see more of the chocolate maker and why he is who he is.<br/><br/>Willy Wonka, world renowned chocolate manufacturer, holds a contest allowing five children to enter his secret factory, with his intentions being his own business.<br/><br/>The original Willy Wonka is a light-hearted musical. While this Charlie has songs, it's kind of hard to beat Sammy Davis Jr.'s Candy Man or the original Oompa Loompa songs. I refuse to discredit this version too much. In this Charlie, the children's punishments are more just and Willy Wonka is given a full origin. Charlie's father's alive in this one so the family's situation isn't as dire. The fate of the Buckets are revealed here where it was anyone's guess what happens after in the first Willy. I'm confident everyone will enjoy this movie and fans of the original will be just as satisfied. In these eyes, it was an all star cast that put on a good show."
"thelawrences","8","2","3","14 October 2005"," draws you right in
","I really liked this movie - it was so bizarre it just drew me right in. Todays CG technology really plays up well in this type of film, and the characters were well cast. The movie is close enough to the Gene Wilder version to be comfortable, yet adds enough new information (mostly from the book) to keep the attention. Depp's portrayal of Wonka is more disturbed than quirky - you actually feel a little sorry for him, and the boy playing Charlie does an excellent job. My kids loved it as well (aged 10 & 14). The characters of the other children invited to the factory are quite well played, very similar to the original. You get a glimpse into Wonka's past, a little understanding of what has made him the way he is. Note: you will either love or hate the Oompa Loompa music sequences..."
"Ajarn_Cole","8","2","3","7 October 2005"," Definitely a great remake...
","When the original movie, Willie Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, came out I was 10 years old. I loved and watched it many times while it was in the theater. It has always been a great movie and the only person in the world who could have remade it is Tim Burton. He is a true visionary of our time, and I've loved every movie he's ever made.<br/><br/>Something I noticed while watching this movie is the number of return actors that are willing to go with Tim in any movie he asks them for. I'll bet there is a line of actors waiting to be in his movies. I know I would be in that line if I was an actor. :-)<br/><br/>Additionally Johnny Depp is ""The Man"" in movies. He is so talented and can act in any genre. Tim Burton and Johnny Depp are just awesome together!!<br/><br/>Like MadMax says, this may sound like a commercial but take your entire family and their friends to see this wonderful movie. It is definitely an original from the original. 8 out of 10 stars for me!"
"Philby-3","7","2","3","22 September 2005"," Visually splendid and fairly faithful remake
","Former Disney animator Tim Burton has a rather hit and miss record as a film-maker but he usually has a firm grip on fantasy and does Roald Dahl proud here. He sticks pretty close to the original story except for an interesting if not wholly successful attempt to flesh out Willy Wonka's background, with Christopher Lee playing Willy's father. All the children save Charlie are monuments to defective parenting and of course all get their come-uppance. Charlie is of the deserving poor but wedded to his family and is duly rewarded.<br/><br/>The production values can hardly be faulted. Money and a vibrant imagination is a potent combination. The exterior of the chocolate factory, the squirrels' nut-cracking room, the chocolate river ride all linger in the mind long after. Only the Bucket house, too comically dilapidated to be true, struck a false note (the other buildings were generally realistic  even the chocolate factory could have come out of the same architect's office that produced the Battersea power station). The Oompa Loompa song and dance numbers could have been done by Busby Berkeley, though he would not have been able to get by with only one Oompa Loompa (here computer graphics provided the rest).<br/><br/>The acting was perfectly fine; I only hope the children escape the oblivion which awaited the child actors in the 1971 film with Gene Wilder as Willy Wonka. I enjoyed particularly David Kelly, his subtle Irish charm turned on to full, as Grandpa and James Fox as Veruka Salt's ramrod-straight but weak dad. Johnny Depp denies basing his characterization of Wonka on Michael Jackson but there is an uncanny resemblance. His Wonka has also a touch of Howard Hughes and even overtones of Henry Ford  industrial autodidacts who did things their way, meeting with both spectacular success and failure. In this film his shyness is more apparent but he could not be described as child-like except for his love of candy. The Mars family of candy bar fame are pretty reclusive  though it's probably not because they are shy, just mega-rich.<br/><br/>This is a kid s movie and the members of the target audience I saw the film with evidently enjoyed it. For me it was a visual treat. The story and the atmosphere are almost intact though I'd suggest reading the book first, or hearing Roald Dahl read the story on tape/CD."
"ggnocat","8","2","3","12 September 2005"," A nice brand new point of view of Dahl's book.
","The problem with anything new it is the expectation anyone has. If a movie is a Burton's one, you should know you are about to face something strange, dark and somehow scary. This movie is quite another thing compared to the previous one, and it may appear as it is something completely different from the book it is based on. I've read all what Mr. Dahl has written, included his adults novels, and I can say that this movie, even if it is not reflecting the book, well presents some points of the book on which the reader may not focus on. Willy Wonka is a madman. No doubt about it. It is also a genius, since the two qualities often are found in the same person. This you can tell by reading the book but you clearly see it on the movie. I personally found the concept of Wonka's father interesting and well structured. In fact, the book did not tell anything about Mr. Wonka before the factory opening, and this ante-fact is acceptable as wheel. I found Kubrick quotations well fitting at that stage of the movie... It is another way to read Dahl's book, and I find it really interesting."
"warren-johnstone","7","2","3","10 September 2005"," A great adaptation of the book - Depp is outstanding
","Charlie (Highmore) is a small boy from a poor background who lives with his parents and 4 grandparents in a ramshackle old house. One day the reclusive Willy Wonka (Depp) announces that he will allow five lucky children to tour his chocolate factory and five golden tickets are hidden within Wonka chocolate bars. Charlie manages to find the last golden ticket and along with his grandfather, they commence the tour of the mysterious chocolate factory.<br/><br/>Thankfully, this movie was true to the original story. Depp's mannerisms and voice were prefect as the eccentric and reclusive Wonka and he was the highlight of the movie. With the help of computers, Deep Roy was excellent playing the part of all of the Oompa Loompa's, and the actors playing the roles of the other ticket winners made their characters very dislikeable."

","I thought it was pretty good!, The graphics were amazing...And i Just loved Willy Wonka's new personality, rather serious, but in a funny way! If ya get me! The best part about the film was probably the umpah lumpahs, they rocked...they were really funny and really really cute...i just loved the songs! Although the film was fantastic...i still prefer the original, i don't know why, it's just something about the original that makes it that bit more special. It's probably because the original is a classic and will remain that way forever! You can re-do a classic, but you can never replace a classic...don'tcha think? But, all in all, a truly fantastic film. It's a must-see film and definitely a must-buy film, once it comes out on DVD and video."
"dkthomas","8","2","3","26 August 2005"," A Sweet Success
","Willy Wonka can't stand kids. I love the way it shows wonka trying to keep his cool whilst surrounded by a bunch of spoilt brats, (well, except for Charlie).<br/><br/>Tim Burton and Mr. Depp portray this in dazzling manner. The film is very colourful and very Burton-ized. Just look at Charlie bucket's little house and you know Tim has something to do with it. The factory is amazing and, as you'd expect 30 something years later, full of special effects and more update machinery. And, i did think before watching this movie that i would get a bit bored as i already know what happens from the first one and it would just have a bit more polish to it. BUT, i was proved wrong because in a very clever way, Burton gives you the answers to questions you wondered in your head from the first film. ""I wonder what oompa land looks like?"" or ""do you think Willy wonka has lived in the factory his whole live?"". Well now i now oompa land has a lot of trees. <br/><br/>Well, now we know that this film contains a number of tree's, however, we also find out that this film contains Dads or father's or poppa's or whatever you call them. Well i call my male parent Dad so i will use this name. Anyway, this time around Charlie Bucket has a Dad. Now, as much i can recall i don't think we see Charlie's dad in the Gene Wilder wonka. So, Charlie's Dad works in a factory and earns a pittance of cash. Unlucky. Another Dad we see is actually Willy Wonka's. Well when i first heard that Wonka's dad was starring in the film i immediately thought of a crazy elder holding a candy cane as a walking stick but no Willy Wonka's dad is a dentist. Christopher Lee is the dentist and a pretty harsh dad. It goes back to Wonka's past and shows us his Dad's strict personality. <br/><br/>But all in all, this film is very eye catching, entertaining and humorous. Depp plays a good role as Willy Wonka but i still think Gene Wilder is the chocolate master. The kids suit the roles of the characters perfectly, (Augustus Gloop is very fat, for example). Emotion is also portrayed in this film too, as Wonka battles with his family issues past and present. Squeeze the whole film in a bar of chocolate and it would taste good, look good, and grab your attention in every bite you take."
"seargent43","Null","2","3","25 August 2005"," Visually Beautiful and Reasonably Entertaining
","I recently saw Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, and being kind of grown up, I enjoyed the film. It was a nice breath of fresh air from a lot of the more contemporary action films that are constantly released these days. The movie's plot line follows that of the Willy Wonka and Chocolate Factory with some modifications. The sets and visual effects are vintage Tim Burton, gorgeous and beautiful, they take you into another world. While this sort of fantasy like environment was a distraction in Burton's Batman films it fits this movie like a glove. Willy Wonka is an eccentric character portrayed by Johnnie Depp, in this film we get to learn of Willy Wonka's origins which are told through flashbacks. We also get to know a little bit about the Oompa Loompas. The movie moves quicker than the Gene Wilder film that was made in the 70's. Its also a bit more cynical, Willy Wonka is a colder person in this one. The best part of this movie is its sets and visual effects which are gorgeous. The movie doesn't take itself too seriously and was quite entertaining."
"Fiona-39","8","2","3","25 August 2005"," Some thoughts on the references
","I enjoyed this a lot: it seems people who didn't had in mind the 1971 Gene Wilder version, and this is v different. It's been years since I read the book, so couldn't get too annoyed on the whole changing the book thing. What I really wanted to add my ha'penneth about was the sheer cinematic intelligence on display: from the moment the young Wonka steps out of the 'hall of flags', we have some v witty visual jokes about cinematic cliché. My favourite reference has to be to 2001: a Wonka chocolate bar as the mysterious glowing objects among the apes (after we've just heard the famous soundtrack). It could be simple a homage, but it's a thought-provoking reference too, with Wonka's amazing elevator able to take to the skies as well and also him seeming to be virtually ageless. There's a creepiness about his factory that mirrors some of the creepiness of outers-pace in 2001 and Solaris. Just a thought. (ooh, there's a funny Psycho reference too)."
"ClassicMovieFans","8","2","3","13 August 2005"," A well-scripted and eye-catching movie
","By creating a beautifully crafted town and mysterious chocolate factory with the loving Bucket family struggling to make a living, the audience was treated to a wonderful journey  both artistically and sentimentally.<br/><br/>The contrast between the shabby, tilted and weather beaten house and the kind-hearted Bucket family (3 generations) living inside was huge. Charlie's quest for one of the five golden tickets to the chocolate factory was never smooth and easy. His heart (so did the audience's) sank lower each time the news announced another ticket found elsewhere and he himself unwrapped another ticketless bar. The atmosphere was intense when Charlie's grandparent sent him to buy one more bar with his own last coin. When the screen darkened as the grandfather closed his eyes, the audience suspected that the grandfather was just gone for good. Not so, fortunately.<br/><br/>The second part of the movie took us to watch how the children, succumbed to temptations, were eliminated one after another (reality show?). In the nut sorting room, when the squirrels sensed the threat of the approaching girl, stopped and ready for attack was creepy.<br/><br/>Charlie's grandparents and parents, with their big screen shots, have displayed their love of Charlie well. But it was Freddie Highmore who was natural in portraying the young and determined Charlie who would not give up his family for anything else. Johnny Depp, with his sinister look every now and then at the unlovable traits of ""sophisticated"" children, built up an unpredictable and secretive atmosphere around him.<br/><br/>The movie succeeded in that the people were always placed at the centre and were not dwarfed by the special effects and the colorful props. Does it appeal to the child side in every person? Absolutely. Does the film appeal to the adult side in every one? To some extent. Yes. A delightful treat the movie is."
"angelichobbit","9","2","3","2 August 2005"," Interpretation not remake
","Like most people, I was sceptical about what to expect from this film, but I have to say I was impressed. The film was in no way a remake due to the considerable change in some plot areas (i.e the addition of Wonka's back story and the lack of Charlie and the everlasting gobstoppers) and if it is viewed as such it is a fantastic film in its own right. However, I do have to admit that I question the sanity of Tim Burton in some areas. The oompah loompahs were just plain weird. Like some kind of messed up dream or hardcore drug trip! But they were never meant to be the little orange and green people of the original so who cares! <br/><br/>There are some genius parts to this film, I won't go into too many spoilers, but there is one line which for me proves the films worth: <br/><br/>""Everything in this room is *eat*able. In fact, I'm *eat*able. But that is called cannibalism which is frowned upon in many countries.""<br/><br/>Enjoy the film as a reinterpretation, not a remake, and you'll see its genius for yourself."

","Director Tim Burton has made great movies for a long period of time. His best movies are Beatlejuice and Edward Scissorhands and his other movies came really close. Then Burton went along and made Planet of the Apes and Big Fish which are two movies I was really disappointed with. But i must say this time he delivers a good one.<br/><br/>""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" is a film worth watching for a number of reasons.<br/><br/>Gene Wilder's Willy Wonka was a lovable, trustworthy with kids kind of character. Johnny Depp's Willy Wonka is a creepy, mysterious character. Even his looks give you a hint of Michael Jackson. Johnny Depp's performance is perfect for the role of Wonka. A umm...who are you? kind of character in a kind of umm...where am I? kind of place.<br/><br/>The film gets more detailed with the Wonka character which is something that wasn't done in the original. I like the fact that we first see this strange and bizarre person as a mystery but as the film goes on his past opens up and we see the inside of the character.<br/><br/>The look of this film is incredible. Tim Burton was perfect as director. He fills the screen with fantastic sights. The film was shot in a great way (especially during the scenes with the oompa loompa songs) and the sets looked extraordinary.<br/><br/>The supporting roles were acted out pretty well. The one I enjoyed most was Freddy Highmore as Charlie Bucket. I thought he was great in ""Finding Neverland"" and I expected the same when I went to see this.<br/><br/>Can this film beat out Burton's classics? No. Can it beat out Planet of the Apes and Big Fish? Yes. Now that Burton is back on the good road let's hope he stays there."

"crispy_comments","1","8","21","17 July 2005"," Nightmare at the Chocolate Factory
","When I first heard that Tim Burton and Johnny Depp were going to do their own version of Roald Dahl's Charlie And The Chocolate Factory, I was very intrigued. It seemed like a great idea. But, although I admire much of the work they've done in the past, I do think they've botched this one.<br/><br/>Burton's visuals are cool, but I get the feeling he was more interested in the LOOK of the film and should've paid more attention to the script and characterization. How hard can it be to adapt such a great story? I don't see how he can claim this version is faithful to Roald Dahl's book, when for instance, Burton decided to create a completely unnecessary ""daddy issues"" backstory for Willy Wonka. Not to mention the whole ""Wonka hates children"" idea. And various instances of inappropriate humour and disturbing imagery. If you want to make a darker, more ""adult"" Willy Wonka, don't market it to kids and families! But of course, then they wouldn't have a summer blockbuster.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp also disappoints, and I'm speaking as someone who thought Gene Wilder's Willy Wonka could use improvement. I was not a big fan of Wilder's film and I was hoping Depp would really capture the character as written in the book. Turns out, Gene Wilder was better, with his portrayal of Wonka's sly humour and mischievous nature. Johnny Depp's performance brings to mind characters he's played in the past, like Ed Wood. And, oh god, Michael Jackson. This is not a good thing. Just because Willy Wonka has been reclusive/secretive for years, does not mean he should be played as socially inept or creepy. Bad acting decision on Depp's part.<br/><br/>By the end of the film, we should be happy for Charlie escaping his miserable life and being rescued by Willy Wonka and his Chocolate Factory. So you know there's a BIG problem when you find yourself concerned for Charlie and urging him to get away from the freaky man. Especially since Wonka says Charlie can't bring his family to live at the Factory with them!<br/><br/>Please, people... just read the book and use your imagination. It really is the best way. We can't depend on Hollywood to get it right."

If you haven't seen it yet..save your money... and rent it when it comes out on DVD. I just want to say it was sooooooooo baaaaaaaaaaad. Johnny Depp was awful as Mr. Wonka and none of other characters had any appeal..maybe I would give a few points to Charlie but thats about it.

"landonwolk","9","1","1","10 May 2020"," Ahead of Its time, not for everyone
","This movie is definitely odd. The original with Gene Wilder is a classic, and these two movies are very different, despite having damn near the same story. Both approaches are effective, just to different audiences. I personally love this version, with Burton helming another quirky and bizarre film that will have you smiling and cringing in equal amounts. The original is much more tame through most of the movie, but it also gets much more serious in certain moments. In fact, the original is more tense in many ways (the tunnel scene, the wonka outburst.) Rather than have these quick moments of intensity, Burton conveys an overall feeling of mystique and insanity. While it definitely has week moments, most risks taken pay off, and the setting is super strong. I felt like this movie was a trip, and even as a kid, I loved this version, although I can see why many young children wouldn't. It can be off-putting, but that's Burton's style, and forcing him to do anything else would result in a boring remake with no trademark style. Depp is also incredible and is the epitome of enigmatic. As a whole, this movie probably sits around a 7, but my love for it shoots it to an 8.5 for me. I recommend going into it with an open mind. Keep in mind it's not a movie that will please everyone."

","I won't say this isn't enjoyable in a high fructose, corn syrup drenched, blockbustery way.<br/><br/>It really isn't Roahl Dahl's Charlie, it's Tim Burton's Charlie with Dahl left far behind. (Actually I suppose it's the screenwriter's Charlie, whoever that is, I'm too lazy to check).<br/><br/>Grotesquely funny though never quite as much as it thinks it is, they really fanfic this s#@* up with Wonka getting a back story even. The whole thing has a luridness that can be hard to get used to, but is weirdly appropriate for what was always a rather bitter-not-so-sweet story.<br/><br/>Charlie is similar to his counterpart from the other movie yet strangely synthetic and hard to like. The depiction of the loving but poor family is way too maudlin.<br/><br/>The other kids are actually quite captivating. They're bratty but they've got a good bit of spunk (Or should I say spice? ...no) and they are a pleasure to watch with some great young acting behind them, especially a really Violet Beauregard.<br/><br/>Depp's pantomime Wonka is by turns fun and painful. It's Johnny does what he can but the script should have picked a lane. You can be funny and creepy at the same time but the ingredients were just applied in the wrong quantities.<br/><br/>The imagery is imaginative but it can often look pretty fake.<br/><br/>Ultimately, nothing close to the magical, funny, emotional powerhouse it seems to think it's capable of being but if you go in expecting it to be trash it's kitsch good fun.<br/><br/>Like the book, the narrative is flawed by the real conflict ending way too early and relying too much on coincidences."

","I have known and loved Gene Wilder as Willy Wonka since his movie first came out. The movie itself does have a trite and dated design to it, true, but Wilder's performance is worth the entire opening story (and sick-making songs) to his first brilliantly improvised entrance.<br/><br/>With that said, Johnny Depp also gives an inspired performance here, one much closer to Dahl's world, I think. Wilder's performance had sweetness and heart, with a little wild eyed mania at which he is so superb. Depp's Wonka is an edgy misanthrope, with deep seated fears and wounds he cannot repress anymore. Depp's complete submersion into a character is always fascinating, and I would have to come to see this movie just for that.<br/><br/>However, the design choices will also have me watching this movie for a long time. If it didn't have the handicap of being constantly compared to the first movie, I think this movie and especially Depp's performance would be much more highly appreciated by the critics."
"starinthejawsoftheclouds","8","1","1","29 July 2005"," Brilliant, if a couple of shortcomings
","I loved this film. I was beaming nearly all the way through. I thought Johnny Depp gave an absolutely fantastic performance as Willy Wonka, and I also thought that the way his character had been written was brilliant. Roald Dahl's Wonka IS eccentric, he DOES make fun of the children, he DOES take pleasure from seeing the ""bad nuts"" come to their various sticky ends. Although Gene Wilder's version is cute and heartwarming, Johnny Depp's has much more character, depth and, in my mind, excitement. While Gene Wilder's Wonka seems to be presenting the factory to the children in a paternal, slightly patronising, children's-storyteller type way, Johnny Depp's hadn't quite left childhood (e.g. ""You're really weird!"" *nasal giggle*) and for this reason seemed to be experiencing the factory all over again through the children. It might be said that his ""That's called cannibalism"" remark could be seen as patronising, but I don't think so - it just shows that he's going off into his own little world. The only thing I prefer from the Gene Wilder movie is the Oompa-Loompa songs; techno Oompa-Loompas? They might fit with Tim Burton's fantasy but they sure as hell don't fit with mine.<br/><br/>I also thought the look of it was beautiful. The chocolate landscape was exquisite, the machines exciting, the use of colour sensational (although the greys and browns that were used in the scenes with Charlie's poor family were a little bit clichÃ©d).<br/><br/>Having said all that, I did have a couple of major problems with it. For example, Freddie Highmore is English. So are all the actors playing his family. So was the man at the sweet counter, and the people offering to buy Charlie's golden ticket. Yet: Charlie didn't stop talking about ""candy bars"". Neither did his family. And they paid their money in DOLLARS. I don't have any problem with setting the film in America, if that's what they were trying to do. But in that case, I'm sure there are plenty of other competent American actors that could have played their parts. If that wasn't the case, and it was set in England, then WHY were they talking about candy and paying in dollars? And if I'm wrong and it wasn't set in either place, then they shouldn't have put in place-specific things like dollars without making the film place-specific.<br/><br/>The other (main) problem I had with the film was Willy Wonka's background. Willy Wonka stands alone. He is an enigma. That is part of his charm and intrigue. By making him a seemingly troubled soul with hangups about his parents, you make him much more human than he is supposed to be, and add a dimension to him that is totally unnecessary and doesn't fit with either what Roald Dahl wrote or what Willy Wonka is supposed to be like. It also adds to the problem of the reconciliation scene, which is utterly pathetic and even more unnecessary than the back-story.<br/><br/>That said, I thought the film was brilliant, I thoroughly enjoyed it and would recommend it to anyone. And if anyone knows whether the film is place-specific, I'd like it if someone told me! <br/><br/>8/10"

","Charlie and the Chocolate Factory 9/10<br/><br/>When I first started hearing about this remake about 6 months ago I was very skeptical. The Johnny Depp image just didn't seem to fit the Willy Wonka character. Now I still agree somewhat with my original thought but instead Depp and Burton created a whole new level of Willy Wanka and made what is about as perfect of a ""remake"" as possible. Beside Highnmore and Depp the cast was forgettable. They were not terrible but I found them more obnoxios than the original characters in the 70's.<br/><br/>Since everyone knows the story I ill ay I liked the more emotional Wonka in the elevator at the end of the original but I liked the Oompah's even more in this movie. It was just so darn fun.<br/><br/>Go see it!"
"ArizWldcat","7","1","1","29 July 2005"," Imaginative and Different
","There are a lot of good things about this version of Roald Dahl's classic. I loved the interaction between Charlie and his family. The scenes in the chocolate factory are imaginative and fun to watch. Loved the production numbers with the Oompa Loompas, but found myself wanting the words on the screen...there were times I couldn't understand them. The fates suffered by the nasty children are all fitting and fun to watch. In the 1971 version, we never saw what happened to the kids later, but they did show them leaving at the end of this one. That was a nice change, and funny.<br/><br/>I think the movie would have been better had Wonka been made a little more likable and warm. He comes across and just a little too creepy to be likable. Having said that, there were several good laughs in this, and lots good special effects. You can certainly tell that Tim Burton directed this. It is indeed darkly funny, and some smaller children may be disturbed by this."
"tvnuts","5","1","1","29 July 2005"," An unexpected delight
","To be perfectly honest I didn't expect anything from this movie. I loved the book as a kid,but hated the first movie: ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"".Roald Dahl himself didn't like that movie which says a lot.<br/><br/>However I was pleasantly surprised that I really ended up enjoying this movie.Johnny Depp is amazing as Wonka,outshines Wilder by a long shot. His portrayal is not scary,but wonderfully weird. Young Freddie Highmore as Charlie was equally as good and has a real future as an actor if he decides to keep it up. The rest of the cast also gave amazing performances,especially veteran Irish actor David Kelly as Grandpa Joe (remember that episode of Fawlty Towers??? :D).<br/><br/>I was however disappointed that they replaced the story of the rival candy maker who asks the children to steal an ever-lasting gob stopper with the story of Wonka's father and his childhood.However that wasn't in the book either but in the end they both give us the same result,Charlie is a kind-hearted young boy who deserves the factory and Christopher Lee is always worth watching. However it seemed like something Spielberg would do (happy sappy ending) and it was kind of annoying.<br/><br/>However overall,this combined with the amazing visual effects makes this movie well worth seeing."

","take a pinch of chocolate powder, mix in 2 spoonfuls of Mr J Depp and his unique madness, coat thoroughly with lashings of creativity by Roald Dahl and you have this movie. look and think, remember all the madness that Tim Burton - Edward Scissorhands, The Nightmare Before Christmas, Beetlejuice - has brought to us over the years.<br/><br/>This retelling of the story of Charlie Bucket sticks more close to the original book than the Gene Wilder version which was so Hated by Roald Dahl.<br/><br/>The film still bumps off the various horrible children one by one in methods that reflect their vile personalities and character flaws. The Oompa Loompa's still sing stupid songs in almost Busby Berkley type dance numbers.<br/><br/>One man plays all the small dancing freaks (Deep Roy), although I think there must be more midget extras who are unseen to carry the huge bar of chocolate in the homage to 2001: A Space Odessey.<br/><br/>There is no Mr. Slugworth appearing to tempt the kids to steal Mr Wonka's secret's, although he is mentioned by name in another section of the movie. Charlie has a father and mother, differing from the Gene Wilder version.<br/><br/>The ending of this actually does tally with the end of the book, leaving open the option of finally making Charlie and The Great Glass Elevator.<br/><br/>Money, lawyers and Roald Dahl prevented the making of the second film when Wilders first version was created. Perhaps the madness of Tim Burton can tempt the Dahl estate into allowing this to finally appear on the screen."
"nathicastro","9","1","1","29 July 2005"," Tim Burton's Factory is just great!
","Charlie and The Chocolate Factory is outstanding! Is just perfectly produced and directed. Be warned that this movie is not like the ""Willy Wonka and The Chocolate Factory"".It's a Burton's understanding of the book. Beginning from the name of the movie. But it's also fantastic. The stage setting has the class and style of Tim Burton, made in his Gothic and taciturn way. He works with scenes full of colors that even can bring you nausea and others scenes completely lack of color. The actors are also great. Johnny Depp is amazing as Willy Wonka and Freddie Highmore was spectacular as Charlie. Both are a great couple since ""Finding Neverland"". The other children are also great. But the great new in this movie are the Oompa - Loompas: Deep Roy was turned into hundreds of funny short mans. Fans of Tim Burton might think there are some evidences that remember other Burton's movies, like when Wonka cuts a rope to open the factory in the beginning of the movie with his scissor inside his sleeve (to mention ""Edward Scissorhands"") and when Mike TV gets stretched in a very uncommom way (mentioning Jack, from the ""Nightmare Before Christmas""). If it's true or not, I don't know... but there are lots of funny details in this movie that will grab your attention for sure."

","""Charlie And The Chocolate Factory"" sticks closer to the book than ""Willy Wonka And The Chocolate Factory,"" with Gene Wilder. Sweet lovable Charlie (Freddie Highmore)lives with his parents (Helena Bonham Carter and Noah Taylor)and 4 grandparents in a literal broken home (Made with doors and full of holes). The family is destitute (The father works at a toothpaste factory putting the caps on the tubes, and they eat cabbage soup all the time). Being a fairy tale, their luck will soon change.<br/><br/>An announcement is made throughout the world that Willy Wonka (The amazing and creepy Johnny Depp)is opening up his chocolate factory to the holders of 5 golden tickets. Lucky Charlie gets hold of one of them and, with his grandpa Joe (David Kelley)at his side, they go off on an amazing adventure.<br/><br/>The other 4 kids are obnoxious as hell and you are really glad that they get what's coming to them.<br/><br/>Depp looks a bit like Michael Jackson in some aspects (And this comparison seems to be getting bigger by the minute). The back story on Wonka's childhood (With a nice performance by Christopher Lee)which fuels his chocolate obsession,is a bit touching (Especially when they reunite at the end of the film). There are a couple of musical numbers with the Oompa Loompas (All played by Deep Roy), which are a bit creepy but oh so funny! Tim Burton seems to be back in form (Planet of The Apes knocked him down a few pegs)and it's good to see him back. Danny Elfman's (Who is long overdue for an Academy Award)music is haunting and delightful to hear (He also sings the songs).<br/><br/>Fun to watch, and you will have a song on your lips and a taste for some chocolate."

","This was an awesome film! Although the overall feel was sorta ""fake"" and creepy, it was still a family film. Maybe the little ones might not like it so much (under 5 years old) but it's still very whimsical. As can be seen, there ARE errors in the film, but so minor that it does not affect the viewing at all.<br/><br/>In comparison to the original film, this version is a lot funnier. Because of Tim Burton's influence, the aura of this film is just plain strange. There are minor differences from the original, such as how Charlie ends up finding the ticket, all of Willy Wonka's flashbacks, and seeing all the other children leave the factory in the end. These all add other dimensions to the characters, and I enjoyed them.<br/><br/>9 out of 10, cuz it was a little creepy ;)"

","I have to say, that when I first heard they were remaking the chocolate factory, I was a little nervous. But, Gene Wilder's portrayal is totally safe, and far different from this story, which should not be classified as a remake. This is the real story, from the book. And, I have to say, that I love them both. Johhny Depp is far overdue for any award with the name ""Oscar"" attached. I'm sure he won't win for this one, but I enjoyed him more in this film, than in 'Pirates..."" If you don't like Johnny, fear not. The oompa Loompas will have you chair dancing (As I was in the theater).

"ghettopokey","9","1","1","28 July 2005"," A wonderful family movie
","No, ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" does not have the ""magical touch"" as did the first version ""Willy Wonka"" did, and doesn't have the classical songs that everyone still hums along to today. The oompa loompas are quite scary looking and Willy Wonka has an eerie smile. But that's the only bad part of this movie. ""CATCF"" is still a very great movie... Much more modern and still amazing, and definitely worth watching. Willy Wonka's plot of an unselfish child to inherit the chocolate factory is much more known and makes more sense than in the original... This ""reimagining"" makes more sense than the original all together. The chocolate, all the better and more delicious looking, also (of course I had to say that, everyone only wants to see this movie because of the chocolate). Tim Burton did a wonderful job in creating this movie and Johnny Depp was great in acting it. It has humor, mystery, an interesting soundtrack, attractive dialogue and beautiful scenery. You can never tire of this movie-- adults and kids alike. Children will enjoy the sarcastic attitudes of the 5 chosen children and the humor of Willy Wonka, and adults will love the lines you can recognize from the older movie. And everyone will love all the chocolate."
"GEM-20","7","1","1","27 July 2005"," Enjoyable work of an old story
","When I first heard that they were making a new ""Chocolate Factory,"" I couldn't see any reason. The original is a classic, and was the first movie I went to as a kid.<br/><br/>A refreshing take on the new film is that it is not simply a remake of the 1971 movie. This one tells you much more about Willy Wonka and the operation of the factory. There are a few updates to the story: Mike Teevee is a video game nut! <br/><br/>There are some very hilarious moments in the movie. I won't spoil them and tell you what to look for, but be prepared to laugh. Also, this film shows more of Johnny Depp's talent. His Willy Wonka is completely different from the great Jack Sparrow he played in ""Pirates Of The Caribbean."" <br/><br/>Everyone in my family had a good time with it, so it comes with our recommendation. I did not feel compelled to compare it to the 1971 movie. That one will always have a special place in my heart, but this new version of the story is wonderful!<br/><br/>Since it is made my Tim Burton, you will see his style everywhere. One small aspect of it that I did not care for was that it takes place in the winter. Everything seemed so cold and dark at first. In the 1971 film, it is a beautifully sunny day when the children arrive at Wonka's factory, giving the feeling that everyone is about to enter a fantasy land.<br/><br/>Still, this new one will not disappoint. Fun and funny stuff!"
"surreyhill","9","1","1","26 July 2005"," Under the Hard Chocolate Shell, a sweet and gooey center
","This movie stands up very well to my fond memories of both the book and the Gene Wilder movie of my childhood. At the center is a story with real heart, about the happiness that comes from a loving family.<br/><br/>The opening visuals were so beautiful and wonderful and so very Roald Dahl that I knew I was going to be in for a treat. Has there been a better-looking movie all year? It was breathtaking, each set piece a glittering jewel. Burton's aesthetic sensibilities are so very well-matched to the source material.<br/><br/>I might as well get my only major complaint out of the way first--I did NOT like Danny Elfman's songs or the way they were performed. I missed the lovely, clear brainworm of ""Oompa Loompa Doobity Doo, I've got another Riddle for You"" from the Wilder version. The Elfman Oompa Loompa songs were wonderfully-well choreographed, but I had a hard time picking out the lyrics and the sound was muddy, but worse than that, these aren't songs a young kid can sing-along to--they were clearly aimed at adults and teens, and I think that's a very bad deficiency. The Oompa Loompa songs should be totally accessible to 6-8 year olds. So--that, I hated.<br/><br/>Elfman's incidental music, though--that definitely enhanced the movie.<br/><br/>But everything else, I liked. I didn't mind Willie Wonka's backstory, and gee, I just smile and smile every time I see good old Christopher Lee up there on screen. Has any geezerish actor this side of Alec Guiness had a better run in his dotage than Lee? Lee and Alan Rickman are the only actors working today who can sound properly menacing without any hint of insanity to it.<br/><br/>As for Depp's performance, I loved it. I roared with laughter when he reacted to the idea of Augustus Gloop-flavored chocolate.<br/><br/>Although I am NOT a fangirl, if my feet were held to the fire, I would have to admit that Depp is the most interesting and versatile American actor working in film today. I have other favorites--in particular my beloved Adrien Brody--who I think that in time might be on that same level, but few are there right now. There are a lot of actors who can play serious roles, or portray people with mental illness, handicaps, etc. convincingly, but if you can play a freak or weirdo or madman or villainous type, OR a romantic lead, AND do comedy well (both physical and verbal) then in my book, you've really got the total package as an actor (and it doesn't hurt to be handsome with big, dark, flashing eyes, either). Not that many guys who are that good-looking and thought of as sex symbols will take the pratfall and the little song and dance and seltzer down the pants. I admire him tremendously for that.<br/><br/>I'm a big believer in the old saw, ""Dying is easy--COMEDY is hard"". I really do respect and admire Johnny's ability to portray all these different interesting and oddball characters, and to make an audience simultaneously wierded-out and tickled. These fine talents are showcased in this movie. Roald Dahl wrote this novel long before Michael Jackson was a gleam in some Motown executive's eye. I think we should try and get past the obvious comparison, and look at Depp's interpretation in a less tabloid way.<br/><br/>But, if you must--then I have to say I raised a parental eyebrow over the sheep room scene. I mean, these Oompa Loompas are worse than Smurfs. At least there was one Smurfette. But these guys, unless they are like Gimli's dwarfs and the women look exactly like the men, don't have much of an outlet."
"kzhere","9","1","1","26 July 2005"," A Response, an Opinion. From a 15 Year old. ;D
","Non-spoiler part of the Comment: First of all, the movie was a great thing. At first I believe everyone thought that this would be a remake of the 1971 version. Instead, it gave me an impression that this movie was made on it's own, like the 1971 version never existed and they adapted it straight from the book. Of course, Tim Burton had probably had to look at the first movie a few times for hints on how he was going to do this. Still, it looks like the movie was adapted straight from the book, though the characters are all a little more insane than they should be.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp's part in the movie was HUGE. With the fact that he is a very well known actor and the shock of his makeup on screen, (Creepy, constantly reminding you that this is a Tim Burton film.) he seems to overshadow all the other characters, and make everything else seem almost normal compared to him. If you haven't already watched this film, brace yourself for totally new Willy Wonka. No comparison to the first movie at all.<br/><br/>****Spoilers part of the comment, be warned.**** If you are going through all these reviews, good and bad, do you notice something? Most of the 'bad' commenter's do not refrain from using profanity to express their feelings towards the movie. Nor do they speak of Depp's character with common sense.<br/><br/>Indeed, Depp's character is bizarre. Don't you think that the fact that this is a Tim Burton film, and Depp's makeup kind of foreshadows that...? Willy Wonka's character was meant to be strange. Those of you who just realized it, the Oompa Loompas were ALWAYs Wonka's 'slaves', as you put it. In the book, in the first movie, and in this movie. The fact that Wonka refers to them as 'imported' doesn't make a difference. That's what they were in the beginning, to put it bluntly. I believe the majority of the world is against slavery in this era, and I think there have been complaints about Oompa Loompas since before this film. I, being so young and 'ignorant', am not sure though.<br/><br/>Charlie Bucket's character was just so perfect. The young and innocent boy just doesn't seem to have any flaws. He willingly shares his birthday present with his family, and sadly he doesn't live in a very prosperous home. After receiving his golden ticket, Charlie doesn't have many cameos until the end of the film. The movie focuses on Willy Wonka and the elimination of the other four children first.<br/><br/>The way the parents and Wonka doesn't seem to care about the 'rotten', 'spoiled' children is probably not an acting mistake. Notice how each parent treats their child in a similar way. They either spoil them, overpraise them, or just submit to their children without complaint. The reason those parents just stand there as their children are in danger is a showing of bad parenting and cowardice. None of the parents have much control over their children, and the rich father didn't seem to care much as his daughter was attacked by squirrels. He even hesitated to jump down that chute after her, when in fact it looks like he didn't mean to jump at all-he was pushed. In reality, any caring parent would risk their lives to save their children, or at least I would like to believe.<br/><br/>Those of you who complained about Johnny Depp's acting, he was meant to be a psycho. He shows obvious psychological problems. He can't pronounce 'parents' without sputtering and making funny faces with his mouth. He doesn't believe in family, and he seems to have planned the chocolate factory tour from the beginning."
"moovcrazy","9","1","1","26 July 2005"," A Work of Genius!!!
","I have to say, the Burton-Depp combination has proved to be quite enjoyable! Ed Wood, Sleepy Hollow. Big Fish and now Charlie and the Chocolate Factory! You all know how the story goes: Willy Wonka(Depp)invites 5 kids (including Charlie( Freddie Highmore) into his factory after remaining closed for a number of years. What happens inside the factory is beyond your imagination! The scenery and graphics were magnificent as well as every kids individual song composed by the great Danny Elfman, who has accompanied Burton through a number of movies. (Big Fish,Sleepy Hollow) From what i have deduced, this movie, in comparison to the 1970's version, is closer to the book, but still has some extra ""fluff"".<br/><br/>I don't think Burton could have done a better job on having Depp as Wonka. His kookiness and eccentricity made him a very funny character! And his costume! Very detailed!! ( Work of Burton, no doubt!) All in all, there are a few loopholes to be filled, but it deserves a high 9 out of 10!!!!"

","(See it in IMAX if you get the chance) Perhaps the only remake I've ever seen that exceeds the original. Partly because technology has improved, partly because it's truer to the original novel and mostly because Johnny Depp can out-act Gene Wilder. Also, play 'I-know-that-person-from-that-movie' as you watch it, because Tim Burton apparently has a cast of regulars he likes working with, but their collective work includes 'Because of Winn Dixie', 'Big Fish', 'Finding Neverland' and even 'Flash Gordon'.

","Director Tim Burton brings his vividly imaginative style to the beloved Roald Dahl classic Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, about eccentric chocolatier Willy Wonka (JOHNNY DEPP) and Charlie Bucket (FREDDIE HIGHMORE), a good-hearted boy from a poor family who lives in the shadow of Wonka's extraordinary factory.<br/><br/>Most nights in the Bucket home, dinner is a watered-down bowl of cabbage soup, which young Charlie gladly shares with his mother and father and both pairs of grandparents. Theirs is a tiny, tumbledown, drafty old house but it is filled with love. Every night, the last thing Charlie sees from his window is the great factory, and he drifts off to sleep dreaming about what might be inside.<br/><br/>For nearly fifteen years, no one has seen a single worker going in or coming out of the factory, or caught a glimpse of Willy Wonka himself, yet, mysteriously, great quantities of chocolate are still being made and shipped to shops all over the world.<br/><br/>One day Willy Wonka makes an announcement. He will open his famous factory and reveal ""all of its secrets and magic"" to five lucky children who find golden tickets hidden inside five randomly selected Wonka chocolate bars. Of course, Charlie finds one of the tickets, and the surprises awaiting him within the factory give Charlie a certain glow inside.<br/><br/>Tim Burton has done it again.<br/><br/>This 'Charlie' is a considerable improvement on the film it remakes, 'Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory'. Tim Burton's imagination gives the film a splashy look to it anf filling it with remarkable sights. Actor Johnny Depp is fantastic as offbeat and eccentric kid-at-heart Willy Wonka. Freddie Highmore gives a magical performance as the generous, curious Charlie, the poor boy eager to win a trip into Willy Wonka's factory.<br/><br/>The remarkable thing about this 'Factory' is how visually stunning it is. Tim Burton lusciously imagined the film, and it's a feast for the eyes... and the imagination. Screenwriter John August fills the film with a subverse sense of humor and wit, and creates a number of hilarious characters. Overall: A Fantastic Effort.<br/><br/>4 from 4 PG: quirky situations, brief language and some mild action."
"Jonny_Numb","6","1","1","24 July 2005"," a balance of caricatured characters and visual wonder
","Tim Burton is a director who has always been at a disadvantage when applying his unique visual style to the half-baked screenplays he is all too often saddled with--no amount of 'flair' or signature weirdness can cover up flaws in character and story (""Edward Scissorhands"" and ""Beetlejuice"" in particular), but with ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" (a return to the grind of Roald Dahl's book, first filmed in 1971) he meets his match. While not as downbeat or malicious as the earlier film, Burton's handling of the characters and situations melds well with his directorial flourishes--with an eccentric Willy Wonka (the playfully androgynous Johnny Depp) and an overwhelming wonderland contained within his factory, the exaggerated, bratty children (plus the humble and compassionate Charlie) and their parents are the pitch-perfect accompaniment to all the visual caffeine. The cast is in fine form, with Grandpa Bucket (David Kelly) and Wonka's father (Christopher Lee) to provide some chuckles for adults, while children will be hypnotized by the fantastic yet menacing factory; like most of Burton's work, ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" too often threatens visual overload, but at least all the elements blend together finely, like a chocolate waterfall."
"StanleyStrangelove","Null","1","1","24 July 2005"," A sweet confection
","Johnny Depp plays Willy Wonka the owner of the world's largest chocolate factory. He places 5 golden tickets in his chocolate bars, each one is good for a one day tour through the factory.<br/><br/>Of the five kids who find the tickets only one of them, Charlie Bucket, is a good kid. The others are rotten, little brats named Veruca Salt (a spoiled rich kid always demanding a new possession), Violet Beauregarde (a gum-chewing, over-achieving clone of her ex-cheerleader mother -- these two always elicited laughter from the audience), Augustus Gloop (a tub-o-lard chocolate addict) and Mike Teavee (a mean nasty violent video game addict.) These four kids are entirely unlikable and this is a dead-on send-up of materialistic parents whose kids control them.<br/><br/>The stars of this movie are Tim Burton's visuals. Charlie Bucket's ramshackle house, where he lives with his parents and grandparents is straight out of a Hansel and Gretel fairy tale. Most of the movie takes place inside the chocolate factory. Each set inside the factory looks better than the last but the two that really stand out are the magic elevator and the squirrel scene which is marvelous.<br/><br/>Depp's Willy Wonka is weird and inscrutable, very much like Michael Jackson, although Depp said he did not base it on the gloved one. The supporting cast is solid with Christopher Lee, Helena Bonham Carter, Missi Pyle and James Fox. Charlie Bucket's grandfather, who accompanies him to the factory, is particularly good. Let's not forget the factory workers, all played by Deep Roy, called Oompa Loompas, which are about the farthest you could get from the Keebler elves.<br/><br/>Parents who take their kids will get the references to Kubrick's 2001, Hitchcock's Psycho, the Beatles' Sgt. Pepper and the Busby Berkley musical numbers.<br/><br/>The great film composer Danny Elfman wrote the score. The musical numbers alone are worth the price of admission with dancing Oompa Loompas in hysterical send-ups of MTV music videos.<br/><br/>For Tim Burton fans, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is not quite on a par with Beetlejuice and Batman."

","I went to watch this film last Thursday, and I admit having high expectations seeing that the trailer very enjoyable (The Willy Wonka song!). But what I saw was far beyond my highest expectations. This film is quite simple to describe: Good-looking, creative insanity.<br/><br/>I was expecting to see something quite funny, although I'm not the biggest fan of comedies. I can happily say that a smile was plastered on my face for more than an hour and I couldn't stop laughing during that period of time either. Believe me, I wasn't by far the only one either. According to me, the main source of laughter was the German boy, Violet's mother (Warning, stereotype!) and of course Willy Wonka. I have never seen such insane jokes in a film before (The cannibal comment, hair cream comment, etc.).<br/><br/>The songs were funny and enjoyable too, although I wasn't fond of Vecura Salt's song. To be honest, I thought it was getting annoying, and luckily enough there wasn't another long Oompa Loompa song following it.<br/><br/>Of course, the whole scenery in this film is probably its greatest pro. Colorful and most of it non-CG, everyone has to agree it's fantastically done, even if you don't like the film itself.<br/><br/>Yes, it has to be mentioned: Johhny Depp. He put down an incredibly charming character and a great presentation of acting. Probably one of his best roles in his whole filmography. Put aside the good looks and his fan base, this man knows how to act.<br/><br/>The why not give it a 10/10? I didn't enjoy the ending.

Come, watch!<br/><br/>Anyway, I saw this today with my friends and loved what Tim Burton had done to it. From the Bucket's bizarre home, to Wonkas big glasses and, well, I wont spoil the rest. The casting was magnificent, Depp was born to play Wonka, even though you will barley recognize him in all the makeup. Freddy Highmore is a brilliant Charlie Bucket, and is the best child actor currently, in my opinion. The other 4 kids that go into the factory are wonderful, except Agustus Gloop might make you want to vomit. <br/><br/>The Oompa Loompa's are much different than those in the '71 film.

The music they make is much better, although many will disagree. It will not be as sung as much as the old ""Oompa, oompa, oompa-dee-doo"" but what the heck.<br/><br/>I give this movie 9/10, due to the great casting, choreography, and directing. Whether you love or hate Burton, you will love this one."

","The only problem was that each subplot within the story seems very brief (each bratty kid's undoing and the unfolding of willy's past at the end of the movie, for example...) I wasn't to comment on the person who said they did not enjoy the songs. I think that ANYONE who is remotely concerned about the closeness of the story to the book will agree that the songs are much better in this movie. They are written BY Roald Dahl himself!!! The different styles of music make it funny and a little tongue in cheek. Here are these tribal, stone faced oompa loompas skipping around and doing disco moves. Delicious. This movie was totally in keeping with the dark humor that Mr. Dahl is famous for. Although the ending was extremely different, it showed even more than the first movie that Charlie is a boy with unshakable principles and a good heart. Also, Depp's portrayal of a super-creative, antisocial, childish sort of Willy Wonka is more what I would expect of a person who's locked himself away for so many years. All in all, I say WELL DONE! It was refreshing to see someone capture the author's intended tone."
"wahzoh","7","1","1","18 July 2005"," Wonka's a Weirdo!
","Well, I saw this movie today and didn't quite know what to expect. Depp as Wonka is, I must say, a tad on the creepy side, but it was probably intended that way. I must say it's always nice to see bad kids get theirs. That little Freddy Hightower was wonderful in the last Depp picture (Finding Neverland), and he's great again in this one. What a wonderful little child actor. My favorite stars of the movie were not human, however. My favorites were the squirrels. They were very squirrelly-ly portrayed, and if they were CGI, I couldn't tell. The oompa loompa's dancing was a little clumsy, but their singing was good. All in all, worth seeing, and an excellent warning to wicked children."

","_Charlie_ has always been one of my favorite kid's books, so walking into another movie version was a bit worrying. The original WW+CF movie with Gene Wilder was more of an ""inspired by"" version than a true rendition of the story. It sat alongside _Grinch_ as well-intentioned but not particularly well realized movie versions of kids books.<br/><br/>Charlie is true to its source, true to the heart and soul of the book, true to the ideas and fun in the story and manages above all else to be entertaining and interesting. Visually the movie is stunning. From the stark, almost black and white city and exterior of the factory to the technicolor interior of Mr. Wonka's world. The oompa-loompas were great, even more so because Burton had to compete with the original movie version that everyone remembers. Deppp as Wonka played perfectly: eccentric and spirited, fun and even a bit manipulative. His joy at his odd universe of creations is palpable. The humor, and there was a lot of it, varied from subtle to slapstick, rarely missing the mark. The special effects were restrained and effective rather than being overblown.<br/><br/>I had a few quibbles with the extended cast. While Charlie, his family and the crew of the factory were wonderful, the remaining children were a bit thin and felt like fodder for a slasher movie. Exceptions included Violet and her mother. My final gripe was that I couldn't understand the words to the songs, even though I enjoyed them.<br/><br/>In all, the movie was just a bit overlong. I thought the early pre-factory section could have been abbreviated. The movie really picks up once the tour starts and minus a few lagging parts, never slows down. I enjoyed it, the kids enjoyed it and we left the theater feeling we'd gotten more than our money's worth."

","Best Tim Burton has done since Ed Wood. Retells the story the right way...now we know Willy Wonka. Entire production is almost flawless, set production, cinematography, direction, and Depp as Wonka and Highmore as Charlie. Couldn't have picked better, Burton. Deep Roy, as we know is all of the oompa loompas. Tim Burton is one crazy mofo for this one. Deep Roy was perfect too. As I said everyone was PERFECTLY cast, even the children, possessing lifelike qualities of the original ones, such as Veruca, my favorite. And I loved how ""Veronica Vaughn on crack"", if any of you get that looked. I hope Tim Burton might make another Roald Dahl movie, maybe Matilda done the right way?? Hmm..we'll see."

The characters and actors made the movie perfect with all the hype going on. Johnny Depp again puts on a great role even though his character was a little too strange. frediie Highmore again puts on another magnificent role.

","As a boy I read the book at least 100 times. When the movie came out in 1971 I was 9 years old. I did not make comparisons between the book and the movie and eventually the movie became the way I remembered the story. Such a classic is the movie that comparisons between this movie and the original are inevitable, and that forms the basis for my review.<br/><br/>The first scene shows us the 5 golden tickets being placed on the candy bars. So already we are robbed of the surprise factor that the original has. The 5 tickets are placed on consecutive bars and apparently put into the same box...yet they end up all over the world. Also, we are told in a narration that Charlie will find one the tickets. Once again, the suspense aspect is lost in the remake.<br/><br/>The finding of the golden tickets occurs far too quickly. The original succeed in allowing us to agonize with Charlie as the tickets are found one by one. The original also depicts a more realistic view of the lengths to which the world tried to find the tickets. Also, there was no time interval at all between the time that Charlie finds out that the fifth ticket was a fake and he finds the fifth ticket.<br/><br/>The scene outside the factory lacks all the hoopla of the original. The fact that Wonka does not appear to the public in the remake is quite believable, but the ""It's a small world"" tribute to Wonka is not.<br/><br/>Willy Wonka comes across as a cross between a sadistic game show host and a pedophile. The scene involving Veruca Salt getting attacked by squirrels is quite disturbing as Wonka pretends to find the correct key to allow Mr. Salt to rescue his daughter.<br/><br/>The Oompa Loompa songs were the only thing I liked about the remake. Although the last song becomes tiresome with its endless imitations of famous musicians and groups.<br/><br/>Charlie Bucket is very likable, but he does not get enough screen time in a movie which is supposed to be about him.<br/><br/>Grandpa Joe is portrayed decently...but he cannot match the performance of Jack Albertson.<br/><br/>Veruca Salt lacks the whininess of the original. She is not credible as someone who gets her own way by throwing tantrums.<br/><br/>Mr. Salt comes across as one who is not controlled by his daughter, yet he caters to her every whim. This is a blatant contradiction.<br/><br/>Augustus and Mrs. Gloop were fine.<br/><br/>Mike Teevee claims to be some sort of genius who calculated the location of one of the tickets. Doesn't he know that this is a random event? And to call Wonka Vision a teleporter shows that he knows nothing about the conservation of mass. Then we again see the sadistic side of Wonka again as Teevee is repeatedly pummeled by Oompa Loompas and Rock-em Sock-em robots.<br/><br/>All of the flashbacks to Wonka's childhood add very little to the story. In the original we learn right away that Wonka is a little bit kooky and we are left to wonder why. Explaining it all by saying his dad was a dentist and would not let him eat candy is ludicrous. And what a waste of talent with Christopher Lee as the dad.<br/><br/>Lastly, I think Tim Burton's influence showed too heavily on this movie. Perhaps if I liked his work I would have a more favorable view. But as I said, the comparisons between this movie and the original are inevitable. The original is a great classic and the remake is destined to be a horrible flop. Thanks for reading."
"JJP_MV","1","6","15","30 July 2005"," A tribute to Tim Burton's ego
","This movie is really terrible. The characters stumble through the chocolate factory from one uninspired scene to the next, with nothing but some insipid dialog to tie it together. Burton tried to compensate with an overbearing, booming orchestra soundtrack and some over-the-top self-regarding Oompa Loompa disco numbers. Depp's Willy Wonka is creepy and effeminate (pink eyeshadow!) as he limps along with the rest of the cast, appearing to be unsure of why he's there. The end of the movie is goofy and contrived, and a complete departure from the book. It's almost as if they got done editing the picture and realized they had ten more minutes to fill so they just tacked on an extra, random chapter.<br/><br/>The movie is a self-regarding, schlocky mess, and watching it, one gets the sense that Burton's main goal is to impress us with his cleverness rather than to entertain children. My kids love the DVD of the '71 version -- this remake will be forgotten in six months."

This is a creepy version of a fantastic classic .. The appeal of the first movie was lost on this version.<br/><br/>one of the things I loved as a child watching the first movie was the musical parts. I think the most amazing part for me in the first movie was the song that Willie Wonka sang as he entered the chamber of candy dreams..<br/><br/>I guess I'm one of the fans that grew up loving the original and this one was just a flash in the pan that will last part of the summer and will be a wash up like all the rest of the sad attempts to dethrone a childhood classic.<br/><br/>This reminds me of ""The Wiz"" ..

"jdelaney2-1","1","6","15","22 July 2005"," Gag me with a Wonka Bar
","I was truly stunned by how poor a film this was in most every respect. As a child the book was a favorite of mine, and to this day I retain magical memories attached to both it and the 1971 original film. Regardless, I found this 2005 version little more than a cynical attempt at scoring easy box office bucks by duping an adult audience (many whom as children fondly recall the 1971 original film) into seeing a version that supposedly was going to emphasize/capture the original book, hence the identical title...or at least, this is what Johnny Depp claimed in a recent syndicated interview I unfortunately read prior to seeing the film... <br/><br/>As stated by previous posters, Depp's character is neither convincing nor at all appropriate for children. One rather typical example; upon entering into the chocolate factory with all five winning contestants, Wonka/Depp announces that everything in the factory is actually edible, including himself(!!), ""but that,"" he cleverly states, ""would be considered cannibalism, which is frowned upon in most cultures."" Pretty darn hilarious, huh? All sexual double entendres aside, it really came across as not only cheap, but in highly poor and vulgar taste. I found this line representative of the whole film. The movie itself is illogical; it goes from child molester creepy to a pseudo-celebration of family values in one fell swoop. The one original section the film actually adds (flashbacks of Wonka's supposed childhood) just gave me the willies and was completely unnecessary. Yuck. I could continue ad naseum but I think you get the point. Save both your money and time on this one, as Johnny Depp & Co certainly don't deserve either, in this pathetic re-make of a now-tainted, yet still classic, story."
"ckone25b","5","6","15","15 July 2005"," I agree completely with...
","William Arnold of the Seattle PI... Here's his review: ""Charm is outsourced by 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory' excesses"" By WILLIAM ARNOLD SEATTLE POST-INTELLIGENCER MOVIE CRITIC Ever since it realized that a movie has to have kid-appeal to be a true blockbuster in the new global marketplace, Hollywood has been regularly throwing gigantic budgets and its biggest stars and directors into ambitious adaptations of popular children's novels.<br/><br/>So far, the results have not been impressive. The simplicity, charm and morality that are the key ingredients of any great fable have been buried under the excess and effects of ""Polar Express,"" ""Lemony Snicket"" and ""The Cat in the Hat."" ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" should have been different. It's been successfully filmed before, it's the fruit of the inspired director-star team of Tim Burton and Johnny Depp, and its star chemistry was proved magical in last year's ""Finding Neverland."" But, alas, it too is disappointing. Its heart is in the right place and it resists the temptation to junk up the story, but Depp does nothing with his character and the movie has little of the unique wit or panache that would make it appealing to an older-than-10 audience.<br/><br/>Based on Roald Dahl's 1964 book, it's the story of Charlie Bucket (Freddie Highmore), a good boy who lives in a shack with his poor but nurturing family in the shadow of a mysterious candy factory owned by a reclusive mogul ""chocolatier"" named Willy Wonka.<br/><br/>When Wonka (Depp) has an international lottery that will bring five kids to the factory for a tour and an elimination contest for an unspecified grand prize, Charlie is one of them, and the other four finalists are as greedy and spoiled as he is generous and kind.<br/><br/>So the movie has Wonka leading the five kids and their adult supervisors -- Charlie with his grandfather (David Kelly) -- through the lollypop-land of the factory, in the process of which each of Charlie's competitors are undone by their individual character flaws.<br/><br/>Unlike 1971's ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"" (which was scripted by Dahl), this version flashes back to Willy's youth to show us how he got the way he is, and the somewhat scary nature of the character embodied by Gene Wilder in the original has been softened.<br/><br/>But this conscious effort to ""explain"" Willy takes all the edge out of his character, squashes the enigma at the center of the tale, and delivers a moral -- bad kids are the product of bad parents -- that's more obvious and less instructive than Dahl may have wished.<br/><br/>Burton, of course, is a genius with strange characters and bizarre fantasy (""Beetle Juice,"" ""Edward Scissorhands""). But his imagination seems stunted by this material: You get the sense he's in it for the money and couldn't care less about Dahl's confectionery wonderland.<br/><br/>Depp seems even more disinterested and lost. Assuming a toothy smile and a blandly effeminate manner, his Willy has absolutely none of the crazed intensity that made the first film such a gloriously offbeat star vehicle for Wilder.<br/><br/>Similarly, ""Finding Neverland's"" Freddie Highmore -- proclaimed by Oprah Winfrey as the greatest child actor of all time -- brings nothing special to the table. He seems self-conscious angelic and fails the challenge of making a fascinating character out of a totally good kid.<br/><br/>Like all the recent big-budget kids movies, this one goes for the epic, and it's crammed with computer-generated visual effects, blaring musical and a half-dozen or so extravagant production numbers featuring forgettable songs performed by an army of CGI-munchkins.<br/><br/>It's hard to make out the words of these songs, but -- in line with the film's message about bad adults -- one of them clearly takes a shot at movies so overblown that kids can't recognize the ""fairy tale"" in them. Talk about the pot calling the kettle black.<br/><br/>I agree with him all the way."
"lilyd123","1","5","12","22 July 2005"," What a shame
","This movie had excellent cinematography and, despite the weird character of Willy Wonka, great acting. My problem with it was the way in which Roald Dahl's book was altered. Dahl was rolling in his grave when they had Willy Wonka tell Charlie he could not bring his family to the factory. Or the stupid way that he kept flashing back to his dad - and then going to therapy. PLEASE! The worst? The way Charlie's family ends up living in their same old run-down, holy shack in their same old nasty clothes inside the factory. What are we supposed to take away from that? That poor people LIKE living in cold, tiny houses? What a piece of crap. That movie would have been excellent if it had shown Willy as he should have been portrayed - not as some odd looking weirdo. Read the book. You'll be disgusted, too. Oh, and I've had people tell me Dahl wrote the lyrics. Yep, it's the ones from his book. He died in 1990. The movie studio wants people to think he gave his stamp of approval. HA. Never."

","In 2004 I nearly got the chance to visit the set of ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" at Pinewood Studios (outside of London). Two people I knew worked there (one with access to all sets) and I had planned on sitting in the trailer where the stars go to eat. I was pretty excited at the idea of meeting Johnny Depp, Tim Burton and others but alas my friend's position on the film ended up being switched around and I couldn't get in.<br/><br/>Then again later that year in Black Forest next to Pinewood I saw them filming the movie (outside of Charlie's house in the film) with many odd sets. The film looked fabulous in terms of production design and knowing Burton was directing I thought there was good potential for a Gothic, revisionist Charlie.<br/><br/>Unfortunately I've just bought the DVD and found myself utterly disappointed. Worst of all was Depp's performance. One of my favorite actors, I looked forward to him playing Wonka - and he's just not that good. Impersonating Michael Jackson or Not, Wonka just comes across as unmemorable. It's like he isn't developed to the point where you leave the theater remembering all his best lines and character traits.<br/><br/>I also felt somewhat cheated by the ending. The Oompah-Loompa segment(s) of the film aren't as inspired as the original and in fact I didn't like the Oompah-Loompah look in this film - a bit too...Mexican? Maybe that was the point, though.<br/><br/>The film is okay but I think a lot more could have been done with it. Even Burton's familiar visual styling is lacking as he uses a good amount of CGI which just makes it appear to be another average CGI-crammed blockbuster.<br/><br/>I hate to say this, but ""Charlie"" is a disappointment. At least for me."
"davidmister","3","4","9","11 August 2005"," very disappointing
","Well i went,with high expectations i may add,2 watch this alleged blockbuster recently and came out of the cinema 2 hours later totally baffled as to why this film is supposed to level off and even exceed the original of Roald Dahls classic.There was so many aspects of the film that made for some very painful viewing.<br/><br/>One of the first things that hit me was the constant interpretation,word for word,of the script used in the original film.For me that showed a distinct lack of imagination in order to try and expand on the old version and gave me the impression the whole film was,in some areas,lazy. I thought the acting was extremely corny,from practically all the cast members,for the duration of the picture.Beforehand i'd heard that the kid that played Charlie Bucket was a gifted young actor who played a terrific part.I however thought his efforts were shoddy and showed no signs of emotions or any excitement.Grandpa Joe's role as well was pathetically played and i found myself just getting more and more irritated by his presence as the film dragged on. Easily for me for one of the films worst moments,was when Veruca was being carried away to the rubbish chute by the squirrels and Wonka was calmly fumbling through his keys to open the tiny gate to enter the area.Veruca was just looking up and calmly shouting dad,dad oh dad.when u get a minute could u come over here and kindly pull these squirrels off me and stop them from throwing me down this deep hole.I must admit i couldn't stop laughing at that scene because it was just so BAD.That scene,for me,sums up the acting throughout the entire picture.I was expecting to warm to Johnny Depp playing the eccentric candy maker but i thought his role was at times bland and at times just plain weird.<br/><br/>Tim Burton decided to add in some new ideas in this updated version,that wasn't included in either the old movie or Roald Dahls novel,that gave some background into Wonkas childhood, and Grandpa Joes incite into his old employment by the candy maker,both of which was presented in a number of flashbacks. I felt that neither added anything to the film and just assisted into making the film drag on longer than was necessary.<br/><br/>Overall,this film will probably appeal to young children who are new to the tale of Willy Wonka who haven't seen the old version.But to anybody older that has learnt to appreciate the classic this will go down as one of the most overrated and disappointing sequels of the decade."

As one of my friends mentioned ""It looked like it was being weird for the sake of being weird."" However, I saw the movie last night and BOY was I wrong! It was nothing short of INCREDIBLE!!! Fans of the book will NOT be disappointed with Tim Burton's delightfully unique adaptation and fans of the original movie will not feel as though they've already sat through it before. To my surprise it was a completely different feel from the Gene Wilder version. It was, as are many Tim Burton films, like you were in a completely different world. The sets were superb and there was definitely a note of magic in the movie. The acting was nothing short of amazing. Johnny Depp is truly one of the most versatile and talented actors I have ever seen. He never reuses a persona but gives each one their own flare. He is positively eccentric (and hysterical) as Willy Wonka. Freddie Highmore is as cute as can be and easily lovable (as well as pitied) as the lucky Charlie Bucket. The other children are marvelous! I loved the little girl who played Violet! I also loved how they brought Mike TeeVee up to date (an obvious change due to advancements in technology!) Also, the chemistry between the whole of the Bucket family is astounding! All in all a deliciously good movie with tons of laughs and fun!!! Adults and children alike can enjoy it, beginning to end! So, if you want a night out with your friends, or family, don't hesitate to go straight to Charlie and the Chocolate Factory!"

The Oompa Loompa is very unique as well. He's a little scary to me because I've seen this actor on a very scary X-File episode years ago.

I am so pleased that Tim Burton brought this movie back. He has an excellent and creative mind and Johnny Depp is one of the best versatile actors I admire. I think each character played their part great in similarity to the original. I would recommend this movie to anyone with or without kids. It is a classic that has show to be an all time favorite to all types of viewers, young and old."

","First I will say that I have been awaiting this film eagerly for a long long time. I have always thought that Willy Wonka was one of literature's best characters. He's a genius, he's crazy, and he's oh so intriguing. I love the book as well as the 1971 classic film. However it should be known that the book and '71 film were written by the same Roald Dahl and are obviously intended to be different from one another. This film IS NOT a remake but in fact an adaption of the novel as imagined by Tim Burton. Those who know Burton's works can probably guess that this film is just as awe inspiring as a triple shot of LSD. Burton achieves a gorgeous and stylized treat that will keep your eyes glued to the screen even if you hate the movie. As for staying true to the story they stick to the book with surprising accuracy except for several key parts. Willy Wonka as portrayed by Johnny Depp is an eccentric and slightly frightening candy maker who is haunted by an unhappy childhood as shown in a series of flash-backs. These scenes add significant elements to the film that fleshes out Wonka more than ever and alters the ending slightly. The children are all portrayed by talented actors and actresses who do all but add horns and wings to the children to make them as detestable as possible, making their demises satisfying rather than disturbing. A fresh new twist on the oompa looma chants deviates from the well known chants of the '71 film but uses lyrics found in the book. I found Charlie Bucket portrayed by Freddie Highmore to be far less irritating than Peter Ostrum's portrayal of the boy in 71. As for Mr. Willy Wonka. He is far more upbeat with a much wilder disposition and wit with a much more fleshed out character who seems to have been affected by the 20 years of isolation through his lack of social graces and crazy nature. It's wild, fun, and pretty. Depp is incomparable and Burton's vision is brilliant. All of this topped off with much more humor and a superb score make this the family movie of the year. As for which film is better, they cannot be compared they are two uniquely different but equally superb films. Those who enjoy a light musical and a more laid back film should stick to the 1971 version. Those with a love for the odd or who want a more faithful adaption should see this one. Everyone should see this one if for no other reason than it's beauty. I LOVE WILLY WONKA!!"

","For everyone who loves Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory (1971) and is worried that seeing Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (2005) will be a waste of time, I would like to offer the following suggestion: You Could Not Be More Wrong!! I have been excited about the prospect of a new version of an old favorite for some time now, but still entered the theater with some skepticism. I left with nothing but a smile and wishing I had not waited until the very last show of the day so that I could have gone right back in and watched it again. This film further convinces me that Depp and Burton are somehow matched on a mystic or cosmic level. No two other people could have pulled off what they did. So much more of the original book was explored and such wonderful surprises pop out around every corner. From the troublesome children to the oompa-loompas you will recognize characters but in a way you've never seen them. Some scenes are as enchanting as ever (like the first room they enter) and others are brand new and utterly fantastic. For children who this is all new for to adults who can't believe a newer version could keep up with, let alone top, an original all I can say is it's magic!!"
"ViveLaNeige","10","4","9","16 July 2005"," Tim Burton is a magician and a movie whiz!
","This version of ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" intrigued me the first time I heard about it, with Tim Burton at the helm and Johnny Depp as Wonka. It also made me go back and reread the beloved book by Roald Dahl, and then, as I thought about Depp as Wonka, I was a slight bit worried about it. I didn't want Depp's Wonka to be *too* weird.<br/><br/>However, the movie is excellent, and though Johnny Depp does of course portray Wonka as quite weird, it's perfect, and has hilarious results. Freddie Highmore as Charlie is also just right: caring, loyal, imaginative, and unselfish to a high degree. There was hardly a moment when I found myself comparing this film to the Gene Wilder version, and when I did compare the two, it was never unfavorably, just remarking on how different the two versions are. Danny Elfman's score is also perfect, with the Oompa-Loompas' songs and the main title theme.<br/><br/>I think Tim Burton was absolutely correct in stating that his version of ""Chocolate Factory"" is a whole different take than Gene Wilder's ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"": it's not a remake, it's actually truer to the book. (Not saying that either version is better than the other.) I think kids will love the wondrous scenery of the factory and the brattiness of the other four kids. But if you're not a kid, you can still wholeheartedly enjoy this funny, fantastic, and totally entertaining movie."
"Campdmg","9","4","9","16 July 2005"," Fun, magical ride.
","This retelling of Roald Dahl book is funtastic! Within the first twenty minutes of the movie, you care about every member of the Bucket household thanks to those Freddie Highmore doe eyes, and Grandpa Joe's facial expressions.<br/><br/>Surprising, there are many similarities in this version to the original version, which director Burton has stated he disliked so much. That may be how we learn the original was closer to the book than we initially imagined.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp's Wonka is offbeat and sometimes disturbing. However, he wins us over with his eccentricities of verbally sparring with each of the children. Missing, however, was the warm connection with Charlie, which is a surprise, consider the connection Depp and Highmore had in the previous joint venture (Finding Neverland.) The entire visual of this movie is a joy to look at. The chocolate river ride is much more enjoyable and much less disturbing than the original version. Danny Elfman's music adds the perfect layer of sweetness to the rapid riding.<br/><br/>However, the big winner of the night is Deep Roy as every single Oompa Loompa. Delivering the only musical numbers in the movie, Roy dances with glee and determination, keeping himself deadpan, and clearly enjoying himself. He may be small in stature, but he will be a big star soon.<br/><br/>I was pleased, yet disappointed that Tim Burton seem to hold back on his usual colorfulness. This move was kept calm and didn't cross the line into the bizarre.<br/><br/>There were, at time, many things to look at, so this movie deserves multiple viewings in order to take it all in."

","When I first heard that Tim Burton was remaking the 1971 version of ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"" due to it's questionable loyalty to its source, I literally jumped with joy. As a hardcore Roald Dahl fan, I absolutely despised the earlier version. I hated the fact that they had made this rather dark fantasy into a sugar-coated sickening-sweet fairytale. And although Gene Wilder is a wonderful actor, I also felt that his portrayal of Willy Wonka was completely incorrect. So, if you absolutely loved the 1971 version, I've got a strange feeling you probably won't feel the same way about this film.<br/><br/>John August, who wrote the script for this version, is much more loyal to the book, except for a few additions (ie flashbacks of Willy Wonka's childhood). Tim Burton finds this amazing balance between beauty and darkness through his direction, something that was never achieved with the 1971 film. The child actors are perfect to a T in their roles, especially Freddie Highmore as the lovable Charlie Bucket. Johnny Depp portrays Willy Wonka as if he's Michael Jackson on acid, and although that may seem extremely scary and bizarre, it works here.<br/><br/>All-in-all, Tim Burton has created a modern-day classic that both old and young should be able to appreciate and enjoy. Roald Dahl (RIP) would be proud."

","My friend and I are Johnny Depp fans and had been anxiously awaiting this film. We took my two nieces, ages 5 and 7, with us to the movie. She loves the original movie, and I've never seen it. How did we feel about this movie? We ALL loved it!!! From the beginning it was wonderful. Freddie Highmore is adorable and did a great job playing Charlie. As a Depp fan I expected a lot from Johnny and as usual I was not disappointed. I heard a couple of critics describe his role in this movie as ""too dark,"" but the only thing I can figure is they must have been wearing sunglasses in the theater because he was funny and a pleasure to watch. He'll never win an Oscar because he refuses to play the political games that it would require, but there is no doubt he's the best actor to ever play a role! I would highly recommend this film for everyone. Adults and children alike loved it yesterday!"

","I went into this film expecting a 10 star film, but came out thinking it was even better. this film starts slow, and knowing the story you want it to speed up, but once it gets to the factory you are wanting it to slow down, so the perfectly wonderful film will last longer. Johnny Depp was a wonderful choice for Willy Wonka, and Freddie Highmore I am convinced is one of the best child actors to ever set foot on the screen. the less known child actors are also great in the roles of the other children, and I especially liked Mike Teavee's performance. The music, written and performed by Danny Elfman was wonderful and reminded me of his early songs while he was with the band Oingo Boingo. I truly think this is Burton's best film in a LONG time. and at the end everyone clapped, something I haven't seen since Lord of the Rings."
"captpicardfan","10","4","9","16 July 2005"," WIlly Wonka Is The Amazing Chocolateer
","I absolutely loved this movie. It has reminded me why the original film was so special. Even though the original will always be a classic, in some ways, I almost think that this movie surpassed the original. For example, it actually showed more than the original film. In the original ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"", it is only mentioned how the Oompa Loompas came to work in the factory. But in ""Charlie"", you actually see Wonka go to their home country and find out why they are even working for him. Another interesting thing about this movie is that we get to see into the life of a young Willy Wonka when he was just a child; he has been emotionally scarred by his strict father who never allowed him to eat chocolate or any other candy because his dad was a dentist.<br/><br/>The scenery for this film is amazing. From the snow covered city, to the candy room in the factory, it was very beautiful and set the perfect mood for the story. Tim Burton in a recent interview said that it is real chocolate that you see coming down the waterfall, no fake stuff. All in all, it is very wonderful eye candy.<br/><br/>As my brother, who was with me mentioned, it was amazing how well the young actors in this film did. Very talented and eerily resembling the actors who were in the original film. The person who was Charlie in the film did an excellent job, and so did the person who played his grandfather. Johnny Depp is the perfect choice for Wonka. Wonka comes off as a big kid and Depp played it brilliantly. He is just what you see on the TV commercials, a very cool character that made the movie even more interesting.<br/><br/>The music was very catchy, with each new person that was eliminated from the contest; the Oompa Loompas changed the music entirely for each one. These songs had me tapping my toes at many parts, it has inspired me to go out and buy the soundtrack. And the classical scores by Danny Elfman were fantastic as well, he is sure to be the next John Williams. His music help set the mood during the opening credits when the chocolate bars are shown being made.<br/><br/>Overall, this film is everything I had hoped it would be. This has become my favorite Burton film. The entire time, I can't remember when a smile wasn't literally on my face; it was just like being a kid again watching the original for the first time, even though in some ways the stories are completely different. This is probably the funniest time I've had in the theater so far this summer, and I have seen Episode III and Batman earlier this season. On a pure enjoyment factor, this movie is tops. What's not to like? It's a feel good movie that touches the inner child in us and leaves you feeling good by the end. If you miss this movie, you are missing something huge."
"curtman2","9","4","9","16 July 2005"," A sweet and loony adventure complete with awes, chimeras, and delights
","A marvelously delectable, albeit bizarre and ingratiating concoction, ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" assembles enough ""freaks and treats"" for deliciously satisfying entertainment that will have you scratching your head in bemusement in strange areas and licking your lips in its visual feast. The new ""Wonka"" tale of the fantastic world of sweet delights is far less ""charming"" in terms of innocence and conventional in terms of story structure than the Gene Wilder version of Dahl's masterpiece, but rather, it deviates as an eccentric, thrilling, and downright psychedelic adventure into the realms of fruitful imagination and awesome aberration. In some respects, it's still that endearing little tale of a wondrous happening realized for an indigent little boy, Charlie Bucket, who dreams of bigger and better things, yet stays dear and true to his family in any matter. Freddy Highmore instills the adorable innocuous, curious, and faithful nature of Charlie Bucket, and gives us plenty of reason to cheer for his golden day of fun being realized, even after the selfless lad initially declines the ""golden ticket"", out of concern for his family's living conditions. On the other hand, a child of a different nature, Willy Wonka, is explored on less empathetic terms, and we can only gather from his various reflections that his eccentric, uncanny, and somewhat eerie nature is founded on repression and emotional neglect, leading him to eventually realize that ""chocolate is the only thing that makes sense"". Willy Wonka, we come to realize, is one strange, unadulterated hermit, who has compassion for his ""Oompa-Loompas"" and a zealous proclivity for chocolate, but has little concern for anyone or anything else the world over. Perhaps nothing can explain some of his capricious, agitated tendencies, or his ghastly, gleeful countenance, or his mousy articulation, or anything else, for that matter. Through the bizarre and fascinating journey through Willy Wonka's factory, we become immersed in a visual feast of dazzling set designs, gorgeous colors, and marvelous, innovative visual effects that enthrall our senses and compensate for whatever bizarreness we encounter along the way from Depp's ""Wonka in Neverland"". It's a wickedly gorgeous, thrilling, and freaky adventure of a movie that can be sweet and ravishing, fruitful and wondrous, or bizarre and zany whenever it pleases, and we get a sweet taste of it all throughout. For those who detract and even dismiss the cinematic quality of the film for Depp's ""zany, over-the-top, creepy"" interpretation of Willy Wonka, I would argue that one can easily get past this weirdness by absorbing all of the visual splendor, or beating to the trippy, zany Danny Elfman score, or appreciating some fantastic talent all around from the adorable cast of children, to enjoy a perfectly delightful film experience. It's wild and crazy, but it's also sweet, thrilling, and fascinating- a real treat for those who can stomach Johnny Depp's bizarre, inexplicable antics, and I can assure you, there are plenty of reasons why you can. I wouldn't entrust my child in this Wonka's hands, but I wouldn't deny my child this wonderful cinematic experience, either. I'll take Tim Burton's crazy and exciting trip in Willy Wonka's wondrous factory any day over flocking to much of the uninspired, banal refuse that's normally hogging multiplexes in the summertime. You don't even need the heart of a child that explodes with joy at the finding of that last golden ticket to enjoy this ""Chocolate Factory""- just bring an open mind and a thirst for adventure and visual delight, and you may discover a real treat indeed. Much of it may even dance in your mind long after a regular ""sugar rush"" and some of the Oompa-Loompa singing numbers are not to be missed or forgotten! ***1/2 out of ****"
"Dr_Coulardeau","10","3","6","20 October 2015"," Sweet and bitter like a curry-filled chocolate
","While Tim Burton was marrying Johnny Depp to a corpse in the most lurid and lascivious funeral wedding he could imagine, he was working in a bath of chocolate with five children, three boys and two girls accompanied by one parent each, two fathers, two mothers and one grandfather, Charlie's. The game, the lottery, the sweepstake of this film is nothing but the visit of a chocolate factory worked only by machines and we will discover later a new species of brownish humans who are all, absolutely all midgets, though we can never be sure with Tim Burton. Maybe their shrunken state is nothing but a visual special effect.<br/><br/>This film settles accounts with the industrial world seen as pure exploitation of workers as long as they cannot be replaced by machines and then of machines as long as they can work as well as or slightly better than men, knowing that machines cannot go on strike and cannot steal industrial secrets and industrial property to sell them to competitors. We live in a horrible world, don't we? At the same time he comes to terms with the industrial folly of some entrepreneurs, those who have a lot of enterprising spirit, even if at times that entrepreneurship sounds like the undertaking of workers by undertakers six feet under.<br/><br/>And a whole city can live at times on only one or two factories of this type and it will die if modern technology enables the boss, the owner, the industrialist, the master to get rid of all his slaves. And the film shows that contrast between the rich and powerful on one foot and the poor and closely-knit families on the other foot, by setting one of these families, with a son, a father and a mother, two grandfathers and two grandmothers, in a derelict house, a slum indeed, in a piece a wasteland on the margin, border or outskirt of the main city built around the famous chocolate factory. <br/><br/>After settling his own social vision that will develop all along, Tim Burton has to settle some personal accounts with fathers. I will overlook the national accounts against Germans, Bristishers and some others. Charlie is lucky because he has two loving parents and four loving grandparents. But Charlie is Tim Burton's dream of a family and this dream is here so much attached to poverty in financial and material means that we doubt Tim Burton has ever experienced the warmth and richness of this family in heartfelt emotions, empathy and plain love. We may even think it is too much on both sides: a caricature? Maybe. But Charlie Bucket is the happiest child in the world who is loved by six people and loves the very same six people. No way for Mr. Willy Wonka to take that child away from his parents and his family. Charlie flatly refuses to follow Willy Wonka and take over the factory if he cannot take his family along.<br/><br/>But to make sure we understand the message against fathers and eventually for fathers, Tim Burton provides Willy Wonka with a dentist of a father who is a monster of cold dentistry and technology for the hygiene of his son's teeth. The child is tortured with hygienic and orthopedic dentistry or just as much hygienic dental orthopedics which sounds like some squarely angular Police Department of tooth cavities. The child, Mr. Willy Wonka, will make his life and fortune in sweets and chocolates to pester, spite and reject his father who had never loved him with sweetness and honey pie affection.<br/><br/>And Tim Burton will arrange an ending that will reconcile the two father and son enemies. But that's for you to see how.<br/><br/>Then to say something of the factory itself, it is a paradise of all kinds of sweet delicious pleasures and sights managed by the little brown midgets who can do everything from taking care of the parks and gardens, of the machines and robots, but also of the music and dances. We have thus a ballet of special effects to select the winner out of five. Easy task! One is a glutton and as such he will take a bath in the chocolate river and end up in a chocolate bar. Another one is a vain little girl whose vanity will cost her a happy swelling future, as big as an enormous balloon full of the hot air of her vanity. The third one is a vindictive boy who can only attack, assault and aggress anyone, Mr. Willy Wonka among others, and he will end up flattened down to the thickness of a sheet of paper, and slightly elongated. The fourth one is a girl and she is so spoilt that she requests, demands and orders her father to provide her with anything she suddenly wants. She just went too far and decided to take one of the trained nut-cracking squirrels of the factory who will find her to be a bad nut and she will end down more than up with her father down under in the garbage hole.<br/><br/>Only Charlie and his grandfather will survive the tests because he is polite, intelligent and empathetic. He understands the suffering of our Mr. Willy Wonka but he refuses to patronize him and he answers his authoritarian paternalism with a negative answer and after a while he accepts to be the go-between with Mr. Willy Wonka's unsatisfied and dissatisfied past. And that was a biting decision to take because how could he have trusted such a frustrated and miserable man who did not know his father loved him though this father had never said, expressed or told him so. <br/><br/>So pick your handkerchief young boys and young girls, and older ones too, and shed a tear or two on poor Mr. Willy Wonka saved from perdition by a boy under ten. He sure deserves the chocolate factory.<br/><br/>Dr Jacques COULARDEAU"

","This is one of my favorite film. In this film, the important item is Wonka Bar. It is very famous chocolate and all over the world, only five Wonka Bars are special. There are golden invitation tickets for Willy Wonka's chocolate factory in the each five chocolate packages. Not only in the film, but also many stores sell Wonka Bar in reality. This film is loved all over the world because of its humor character and story. Johnny Depp acted Willy Wonka, who is little strange, and eccentric character. I like his acting very much. I also like Oompa Loompa. They are very small and not human. They sing many strange songs in this film, and I can't forget their songs. They are very strange but I like them. In this film, there are many sweets and the factory looks very colorful. I can enjoy not only its story but also its visual and music."
"Stompgal_87","8","3","6","9 October 2013"," A stunning remake that is more faithful to Roald Dahl's book than the original
","As a child 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory' was my favourite Roald Dahl book and 'Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory' was one of my favourite films. When I saw this at the cinema with my mother when I was 18, I was impressed with how this was more faithful to the book than the original, albeit containing flashbacks of Wonka's childhood alongside additional scenes that were not mentioned in the book and leaving out the Lickable Wallpaper for Nurseries that was featured in the original film. Since my cinema viewing, I watched this film several times when I received it on DVD for Christmas and I watched this at my pen friend's house when I visited her for the day and she laughed at it more than I did.<br/><br/>The scenery is an improvement over that in the original, which was vibrantly coloured but had a chocolate river that was more like muddy water and oddly-shaped Everlasting Gobstoppers, by being as colourful but having a more realistic chocolate river and round gobstoppers. I liked the Oompa Loompas' musical numbers here as much as those from the original because they had exactly the same lyrics as those in the book; however the song about Mike Teavee (who deviated from the book and original film by playing video games instead of watching TV) is forgettable despite the channel changes including him in every programme, the 1960s boyband spoof and the 'Psycho' parody being my favourites. I also liked the stock footage from '2001: A Space Odyssey' and its music. Further to the songs, the musical score by Danny Elfman (a regular collaborator with Tim Burton) is haunting yet whimsical particularly the opening music that accompanies the opening sequence of the interior of a chocolate factory. Technically this is darker than the original, especially the flashbacks of Wonka's childhood, but the boat ride here is not as scary as that in the original. Moving on to the characters, Charlie and Augustus here had exactly the same personalities as the original and this version's Violet is tougher but Veruca is not as spoilt as she was in the original and instead of watching TV, Mike plays video games. Willy Wonka and the Oompa Loompas were preferable in the original film but I liked the inclusion of Charlie's father here and his job at the toothpaste factory. I also liked the squirrel scene with Veruca being sent down the garbage chute because I love squirrels and this is one part that is more faithful to the book than the original. A lot of the dialogue is similar to that in the book if a little corny and random at times, particularly Grandma Georgina saying she likes grapes and Wonka later telling her she smells of old people and soap, which is stereotypical in a sense. The other part I liked that was close to the book was the story of Prince Pondicherry's chocolate palace.<br/><br/>Overall this is a charming if dark remake of a childhood favourite with a satisfying number of scenes that match the narrative of the book. 8/10."
"peterkowalski","5","3","6","25 December 2012"," This title has nothing to do with the original Wonka.
","On paper, ""Willy Wonka"" is a perfect title to remake by Burton, and the very first minutes do account for it - Burton takes his creepy spin on the little, snowed in town of Charlie along its habitants. The whole idea goes south as soon as the new Willy Wonka appears: the awkward and highly inappropriate for the role Johnny Depp. Firstly, he's too young, thus unreliable. Secondly, his character seems to be completely rewritten, resulting in a completely different person. Depp is eccentric, but in a very different way, lacking sophistication and confidence. He's carrying cue cards, as if there was somebody else running the factory for him; every question asked by his guests shakes his doubtful confidence. Depp is a magnificent actor, but he fails to deliver the magic the Gene Wilder was so full of, and which he showed in such carefree way... Which proves to show that maybe, just maybe ""Willy Wonka"" is a title not to be touched nor remade, not even by Hollywood's grand masters."
"phungi-430-495891","5","3","6","22 July 2012"," Wonka Dialogue was very weak
","The Burton – Depp remake lacked quality comedic dialogue. Had Depp's Wonka had NEW and funny sarcastic zingers, the movie would have earned 100 times what it did. Burton should have hired several good comedy writers, for Depp's dialogue alone. Who wrote and approved the ""you really should stop mumbling"" – ""joke"" to be said THREE TIMES in the movie? You can't make something completely unfunny – funny – by saying it again two more times. I was and remain embarrassed by this movie because of the Wonka dialogue. This movie should have been directed by someone who knows how to obtain write and use dialogue like Peyton Reed or Jon Favreau. Depp is such a good actor, and I had such high hopes for this movie. If Favreau remade this movie again, I think it would be a real box office smasher. If they can keep redoing Spider Man, why not Wonka? Sincerely Disappointed , Andrew"

","Not as good as I thought it would be. I, like many others, is a great admirer of Tim Burton's work, but he does seem to have problems with telling a story outright and leave it at that.<br/><br/>First off, I am not that big a fan of either the '71 version or musicals in general. And to make a movie like this, you have to have an angle to improve it. I wish they would have made this without the musical numbers. I agree with many on this page, that the songs serve very little purpose other than giving Danny Elfman and his band some clout. They are very well produced, but they are distracting and are not that memorable.<br/><br/>I am also fond of Johnny Depp but I think he hits the wrong note. I was actually quite sick of this creepy character about halfway through the movie.<br/><br/>There are some good moments and I especially loved the relationship story between Charlie and his grandfather. Remember the drunk contractor from Fawlty Towers? This is him. Unfortunately, the character development takes a backseat, while the obnoxious other children are dealt with. It adds some darkness to the plot but is not that interesting.<br/><br/>I don't know. I kept hoping it would get better and it never rose above anything than a mildly amusing experience with a lot of creative set decoration. Nothing more."
"SceneByScene","Null","3","6","25 January 2011"," Oh dear. Grating voices, characters lacking any warmth, over-CGI'd 'oompa-loompas', and a purposelessness to the story ... a loser of a film
","Oh dear. Johnny Depp gives yet another reliable 'freak-of-nature' performance, totally over-played. His character lacks any humanity or kindness, meaning that there is no avuncular warmth to his character, nor any sensation of genuine humanity towards the children in the story. The whiny voice he chooses to give to Wonka's character is, again, unnecessary; and is so grating it merely serves to detract from what he says. This makes it difficult to concentrate on both the script and the plot of the film.<br/><br/>The oompa-loompas are clearly CGI'd - for ease of multiplication - making them obviously fake to even the most naive viewer. This takes away any 'escape from reality' when watching this film. All suspension of disbelief goes out the window. The comical make-up for the same characters in the 1970s' film version seems flatteringly effortful, by comparison. The advancement of film technology and the generation of CGI should add to the overall quality & belief in a film, not detract from it.<br/><br/>As the film progresses the plot changes to become more & more about Wonka's character, and less about the eponymous hero Charlie. I believe this could be blamed upon the director Tim Burton's obsession with Depp as his lead actor. Burton's continued assumption over the years that Depp can do no wrong in his interpretation of his characters gives the actor too free a reign. But - whether this is accurate or not - in this role the building up of Wonka's character and his part in the film merely takes away the importance of Charlie.<br/><br/>The old version of this film was pure-'70s-kitsch - fun, but a bit OTT - but the new film takes weirdness to a new level: the movie finally comes across as existential nonsense. Who cares about the Wonka character's 'drive'? Wonka's feelings about his father and own life-story should not feature strongly, if at all, in Charlie's story. In children's stories the central character is and always should be the kid. Adults should only be peripheral to their life: an untold philosophy/rule of 'kids versus the adults' normally works best. This is lost in Burton's 'interpretation' of Dahl's story.<br/><br/>Ironically, rather than belying the essence of each film, the title of each film version of this story is misleading: 'Wonka...' was all about Charlie, 'Charlie...' is all about Wonka!<br/><br/>In both the original story in Dahl's book, and in the 1970s' Gene Wilder film version of this lovely children's tale, Charlie leads the story. Burton has simply removed the centrifugal force of the tale, with the effect that the plot spins out of control, loses power, and drifts into nothingness.<br/><br/>What a loss to story-telling."
"hung_fao_tweeze","6","3","6","31 August 2010"," Why was this movie remade?
","To my way of thinking, if you're going to remake a movie, especially one where the original was already good and remains very enjoyable even until today, then the remake must or should justify the reason for its creation by improving on what came before. In the case of this movie there is little that improves on the original. In some instances there are even reductions.<br/><br/>Depp versus Wilder? Wilder was charming, funny and plausible. He was likable! Depp was simply weird and, perhaps insane. Unlikeable.<br/><br/>The kids were essentially the same as the original. Nevertheless, nothing was improved or enhanced.<br/><br/>The internals of the chocolate factory weren't an improvement at all. It was essentially the same only with a more modern approach with today's special effects. Nevertheless, there wasn't anything to put the viewer on his heels with wonder and awe.<br/><br/>There was an annoying reference made to Wonka putting people out of work and replacing them with technology. This struck a negative nerve with me - especially since that seemed to be the prime reason that Charlie and family were poor to start with. This was a downer and could have been avoided in the plot entirely. I don't recall that being an issue in the original.<br/><br/>The brilliant plot motive in the original for Wonka choosing a successor is missing here. In the original there is a tense point where Charlie, the last child remaining, demonstrates good will and honesty by handing the gobstopper back to Wonka rather than sell it for great monetary gain to the competitor. This is missing entirely in the remake. Essentially Charlie wins by being the last standing. What follows after this is lame and uncompelling. (I won't cite this here because I try to avoid spoilers if I can.) If there were little musical asides in the remake I certainly don't remember them. Why? Because they weren't memorable. But how many of you found the Oompah-Loompah song in the original instantly memorable and darkly funny? Overall: This remake is good for a viewing but you will probably come away unsatisfied. This version does not come close to dethroning the original. I have seen the original version numerous times and will watch it again. I will probably never the love or compelling desire to watch the remake again. Really, the only reason this was remade is to generate cash flow with a movie that already has a substantial fan base created by the original."

","I like this movie better than the 1971 version. The characters are great and I love the music. The scenes with the Oompa Loompas singing are my favorite scenes. I love this version of Willy Wonka more than the one in the 1971 version. He's way weirder, crazier, and funnier. My only problem with Willy Wonka is that how he looks and talks kind of reminds me of Michael Jackson. The difference is, Michael Jackson is a pedophile. I think that Charlie was way to perfect. I like how he acts, but it's strange how someone could be that flawless. It's funny that the original film is called Willy Wonka but is focused on Charlie and that the Chocolate Factory but is focused on Willy Wonka."
"SmallTownSim","Null","3","6","24 April 2008"," Horrible, Awful, Terrible- um, not funny, dark- um...Horrible, Awf-
","My experience has been that re-makes seldom live up to the original. But this- Charlie and the Chocolate Factory could scarcely be considered a re-make. UGH! Time watched is time gone forever. It was dark and twisted. For kids? Not mine. They could hardly sit through it for constantly comparing it to the original and were sorely disappointed in it.<br/><br/>Disappointed? What an understatement. Once my children left the room I totally dissed this film but good. Johnny Depp is such an accomplished actor (IMO) I simply thought it was such a shame he did this film.<br/><br/>Boring? There were plenty of moments that seemed to drag by. Dark? From moment one to the excruciating end the film is filled with dark, eerie and uneasy dialog, sets and characters.<br/><br/>How it earned awards is beyond me; although the majority were for the film itself (i.e. costume, editing, hair, production and so-on). I do note there were awards for acting itself to a few actors (Depp and Highmore specifically). But the film was just plain NOT ANY GOOD.<br/><br/>I can only guess that in doing a re-make of such a children's classic with such popularity the challenge was to be ""better"" (why else a re-make), but how can you top or better something that was so perfectly tuned? You make the copy something that is so drastically different that it mostly competes on another level. With that- I give August & Burton Credit... it was defiantly on a different level.<br/><br/>The thing is I usually genuinely enjoy the work of Tim Burton. He is so creative and artistic and credit to his work-peers. But this movie, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory... WAS NOT ANY GOOD.<br/><br/>When I read stuff like: John August had never watched Gene Wilder's Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory until ""after"" he finished the script. (Which to me is hard to believe) but then to hear he said he was surprised at how much darker the 1971 version was as compared to his version??? Puh-leeze! Only if the lights are out and you're watching on an old b/w set! Darker? But, enough of this. I'm sure you understand by now how I felt about this alleged re-make. There are those who like and those who don't. I'm not trying to sway a vote here, simply giving you the impression of how awful it was so you don't have to actually go through the torture yourself and view it. Good luck! LOL."
"freemantle_uk","6","3","6","21 April 2008"," A movie that didn't need to be remade
","Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is an okay film, but does re-create the magic of the original and the dark tones does not fit for this type of children's film.<br/><br/>I admit I not the biggest fan of Tim Burton, but he has made some good films such as he Batman films, Edward Scissorhand and Sweeney Todd. However, his remake of the Planet of the Apes was not particularly good, just making into a plain action film and has an ending that makes no sense.<br/><br/>This version makes the world seem a more surreal place, the character are more over the top and Charlie lives in a small shack with his whole family, even sleeping in the same bed. The factory is more darker in lighting and Willy Wonka is made out to be a more unlikely character who does not like children. The Oompa-Loompas in this version also don't seem to fit as well as in the original version. The world outside should have been more down to earth but the factory a more wacky and fun, not dark and moody.<br/><br/>The acting was good, Helena Botham Carter, an actress I like was the mum, Christopher Lee was Willy Wonka's father and the child actors were good. An example was AnnaSophia Robb who played Violet Beauregarde has become pretty successful, staring in Bridge to Terabithia and Jumper. Johnny Depp is a very good actor who normally gives it his all. He has a strong working relationship with Burton. It was believed that Johnny Depp based his performance on Michael Jackson and really hams it up, like Jack Nicholson did in Batman and Glenn Close in 102 Dalmatians.<br/><br/>I also felt the music in the film was trying to be too contemporary, with the Oompa-Loompas rapping and making the film seem trying too hard be to 'down with the kids'.<br/><br/>Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory left a strong legacy and is a good children's film. It has been parodied in shows like the Simpsons, Family Guy and Futurama. I do not picture that happening with Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. Also when people think of Oompa-Loompas they are more likely to think of original version, not the Burton version.<br/><br/>Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory is not a bad film and I sure it did entertain a lot of people, but it is not a classic and the original was better."

","Okay, I'm a fan of Tim Burton and I also think Johnny Depp is talented (seems like I'm one of the few girls who likes Depp not just for his looks), but I think they both blew it big time when remaking Willy Wonka.<br/><br/>Okay, neither version are that faithful to the book (which movie is faithful to books?), but I liked the 1971 version of Willy Wonka a lot better. In the book and 1971 version, Charlie has human flaws, Violet is a girly girl and the TV addict is smart. With this version, they throw everything out the window. Charlie is a perfect little saint, Violet is a feminist tomboy (catering to Politically Correct beliefs of Americans maybe), Veruca is nowhere near as obnoxoius as she was in the old movie and book and the TV kid is dumb and plays video games (another half-@$$ misguided message that video games rot your brain is being featured in this film. Video Games do NOT rot your brain!).<br/><br/>Oh, did I mention the special effects? The computer graphics in this movies were awful and fake looking. I mean blueberry girl Violet looked totally fake and the CG look outdated, even for a Tim Burton movie.<br/><br/>And finally... WHAT HAVE THEY DONE TO THE OOMPA LOOMPAS? They're no longer green and orange, and they sing RAP SONGS! This screams 1995 instead of 2005.<br/><br/>Even talented Johnny Depp looked like he was bored and was overacting. That's sad, because Depp can do so much better.<br/><br/>If you like Burton, watch Nightmare Before Christmas or Corpse Bride. If you like Depp, watch Pirates of the Caribbean. If you like Dahl in general, read the book or watch the 1971 movie.<br/><br/>But if you want to watch train wrecks with outdated special effects and lame jokes, watch this movie. However, watch it at your own risk!"

It was not cute, amusing, whatever...and to me, having seen Gene Wilder play the original Willy Wonka there was probably no actor who could be as lovable and goofy. I had heard they were going to cast Adam Sandler at one point to be Willy Wonka. Now Adam Sandler could pull off the ""lovable and goofy"" side to that character. I own the original movie..which was ""Willy Wonka and the chocolate factory"". I love watching it. That's why I own it. When ""Charlie and the chocolate factory"" first came out, I rented it. I was curious to see how Johnny Depp pulled off the part of Wonka. Now I know. I was really disappointed too. It seemed like someone was mocking the original movie, I was not happy."

","Ever since Roald Dahl wrote Charlie and the Chocolate Factory in 1964, the name ""Wonka"" has been a household name. Willy Wonka & The Chocolate Factory was filmed soon after in 1971 and became a bigger hit for those who've read the book and those who haven't even touched the 24th page of the book. Finally, after many years, a sequel is made. Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. This is not what you may have expected. You must remember that things have changed. Children's Comedy have evolved over the years and has mixed in with Comedy Central's South Park, the Simpsons, and Family Guy. This movie contains what the 1971 film couldn't give you. Johnny Depp.<br/><br/>The film was very hyped, and this film deserves every time someone has said the word ""love"" while referring to this film. Tim Burton changed this film in many ways. Starting from the music, to the number of characters in Oompa Loompa, to the plot. The plot has changed very much since Mel Stuart has directed the first film. Did you know that Willy Wonka's dad was a dentist and the location where the Oompa Loompas were so terrible that they didn't have cocoa beans? It's true. Read the dictionary or to the words of Johnny Depp.<br/><br/>One great idea of this film was to have one star for the Oompa Loompa. That star is Deep Roy. This adds to the comedy, even though it adds more to the stress for the producers. Great job.<br/><br/>I'm glad I've decided to go into my sister's room and watch this film. It's very entertaining and your children would love it. This might be the new ""favorite movie"" your children would share to their children (if they have some) as an adult. I recommend you to watch out the cooler, more improved, good looking Charlie and the Chocolate Factory."

","I'm not Johnny Depp's number 1 fan, but that NOBODY could have been a better star in the Pirates of the Caribbean series is a no-brainer. He was truly stellar and swashbuckling, fun, delirious, and exciting. Without a moment's hesitation, you could literally BELIEVE he was Jack Sparrow.<br/><br/>Let's put it this way, though, about Depp's starring role in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. I could have been a more exciting Willy Wonka than Depp! I thought the movie was palpably slow and plodding. Deep Roy was great as the 165 Oompa Loompas, but it seemed that whenever ""they"" were about to perform, there was a hesitation and they couldn't quite get in gear.<br/><br/>Most of all, it just wasn't fun; to me, it was bland and personality-less.

It's bound to be a lovely movie.<br/><br/>I must say, the beginning is a bit too slow to my taste. It takes quite a while before the kids get into the factory, which is where the real adventures start. The message inside of the story, being that you should be good and not greedy, is one that belongs to the fabulous Roald Dahl who is one of my favorite writers of all time. And he's right! Don't spoil kids too much.<br/><br/>Apart from that, even if you don't want to know about the message while watching, I'd say that Johnny Depp will indulge you. Once again, he proves how fantastic his skills are. Even if you hate the guy, still, watch it! The visuals are breathtaking and take you back to those days when you were reading the book and made up your pictures of the inside of the factory. This all makes it so sweet that you will want to squeak with joy every now and then.<br/><br/>Without any doubt not just a kid's movie, with lots of funny things and adult jokes.

","'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory' starts off well, has a long and flat mid-section and comes together again at the end. Since I know the story, I wasn't very interested when each kid was being disposed of one by one. It was extremely faithful to the book during this section and there were no surprises. Even the art-direction and costumes just seemed to blend into a bright and gaudy blur after a while. Ho hum.<br/><br/>As for the acting, Freddie Highmore (Finding Neverland) as Charlie Bucket shows that he's a dependable guy. However, Johnny Depp as Willy Wonka misses the mark. Sure he's odd, and I think people appreciated that his interpretation was seemingly original, but his performance is very similar to what he did in 'Ed Wood.' It's not really the same in tone but more in wide-eyed mannerisms. Depp's moments of deep disdain for the kids were a nice touch, but I also liked Gene Wilder's deadpan indifference in the original movie. The oompa loompas were just annoying, and it doesn't help that Danny Elfman isn't much of a songwriter. Sure he's done some good ones - ie 'This is Halloween' from 'A Nightmare Before Christmas' - but he's much better at just composing the score.<br/><br/>Like I said, the beginning was interesting. Burton puts in many nice flourishes and it was interesting to see how he was adapting the book. The tone, props, characters and sets were fine. Like I said, the middle will really drag to those who know how each kids goes. The ending goes off in a direction that gives it a tad more narrative continuity."

But I probably missed the point, because the candy film, like the Wonka candy Charlie mentions, doesn't have to have a point. I guess.<br/><br/>Onward! List of why I didn't like this movie (to be read silently in Ryan Reynolds' voice): <br/><br/>10. Because (name withheld) will inevitably make more money on merchandising from this movie (like all other Burton movies) than from the movie itself. Come on, where's the heart when all they set out to do is make a buck? <br/><br/>9. Because there's no more disturbing boat ride down the mighty, dark brown, chocolate river (Hehehe). That scene alone was a conversation piece.<br/><br/>8. Because Willy Wonka's dad is Saruman.<br/><br/>7. Because Johnny Depp lacks Gene Wilder's classic, golden voice. If Depp's Wonka said coco bean one more GD time, I thought I'd chuck the remote through the TV screen.<br/><br/>6. Because Depp lacks the inner sadness you could see in Wilder's eyes, which you could almost hear in the strain in his voice as his emotions betrayed him. It's replaced by textbook homogenized, Burtonized eccentricity. And all of Burton's movies are starting to revolve around daddy issues.<br/><br/>5. Because Depp is in practically all of Burton's movies.<br/><br/>4. So is Helena Bonham Carter.<br/><br/>3. Seriously. Skeet Ulrich is good too. He's no 'poor man's Johnny Depp! Have you seen ""Jericho""? It's like Lost's second cousin... that I have funny feelings for...in my pants.<br/><br/>2. I know that it's supposed to be more faithful to the novel(?), and that supposedly Dahl didn't like the first film, but this one lacked the sweetness that the original film had, which I loved and would watch constantly on VHS when I was younger. I think I died a little bit inside. It was like watching someone dress up as your dead childhood friend on Halloween to try and cheer you up. A worthy effort, but ultimately painful and a reminder that once you decide to grow up the child within you dies, usually along with innocence, bed-wetting and fear of God.<br/><br/>1. Deep Roy as the only Oompa Loompa. Geez, how many actors missed out on a fat paycheck because they only had to use 1 guy. The produced and modernized and urbanized songs were ho hum at most, I think it was supposed to be cool or cute or something. The old ones were kind of catchy and creative considering the times."

"El_Farmerino_Esq","5","3","6","30 August 2006"," Who and the Chocolate Factory?
","It's interesting to compare titles between this version of the beloved Roald Dahl novel and Mel Stuart's 1971 adaptation, Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory. Why? Because, for Burton's movie in particular, the 1971 choice seems far more appropriate.<br/><br/>It's not that I have anything in particular against Johnny Depp's performance here. I don't rank it as one of his best, granted, but it's a perfectly respectable interpretation of the character. However, as the title of both movie and book should make abundantly clear, Willy Wonka is NOT the main character in this story. Why, then, does Charlie seemingly become a minor character as soon as Wonka enters the fray? It certainly isn't a reflection of Freddie Highmore's performance as Charlie, which is by all accounts absolutely brilliant and undoubtedly the highlight of the movie. It can't be explained in terms of the flow of the film, as for the first fifteen minutes or so we are entirely focused on Charlie. So why, Burton, why? All it achieves is a complete negation of audience interest in the film, transforming Wonka from mysterious outsider to sympathetic protagonist.<br/><br/>Burton's Charlie... is potentially a great adaptation. Stylistically it is great and the humour is in places both hilarious and very Dahlesque (particular highlights being the 'house of flags' sequence and Veruca's downfall at the hands of the squirrels). However, it completely fails to work as a real, fully-fledged movie as it seems to completely forget which character it's actually about. Such a calamitous mistake is particularly disheartening from a director with such a brilliant track record with outlandish character studies - see the likes of Ed Wood, Edward Scissorhands, Big Fish, Batman... - although, looking at such a list, one can maybe see why. Burton's fascination is always with the exotic, with the outcast rather than the everyman. The problem here is that, in adapting a novel concerning an ordinary boy's encounter with an extraordinary man, he only manages to shift the focus halfway. Disappointing, to say the least.<br/><br/>Just one more thing: in a movie where some of the plot exposition is related through song, it is generally advisable to make the lyrics intelligible. Oh, and the songs actually decent."

I was about to take her advice, and not go see it, but I decided to, anyway. Know what? I hated it. My little sister thought it was great... the absolute BEST movie she's ever seen in theaters! But I just rolled my eyes and denied everyone who tried to tell me it was good in any way, shape, or form.<br/><br/>As time went by, I began to search for pictures, clips, and info about this movie, and the cast who was involved in it. I still don't know why, considering I hated it, but I did. Any time I would see an article about it, I would immediately start to reading it, and not put the paper down until I was finished. I remember going home and telling my mom random facts that I'd never knows before, like ""Did you know that Tim Burton and Johnny Depp work together a lot?"". And that's another thing. I had no idea who the heck Tim Burton was... but then I did. It was weird... anyway, back on subject: When I started seeing the commercials for the DVD that was soon to be released, I would always remind myself that I would have to rent it to show to the rest of my family. Well, a few days after it came out, that's exactly what I did. My mom thought it was repulsive, and my brother thought it to be hilarious... until we watched it for a second time, and pretty soon, we were all in love with it. You really have to give it a second chance and watch it again until you can call it dumb or not.<br/><br/>The characters are great, especially Freddie Highmore as Charlie, Annasophia Robb as Violet, Julia Winter as Veruca, and who could forget, the fabulous Johnny Depp as Willy Wonka himself. The music is great... especially those crazy Oompa-Loompa songs (which are very danceable, by the way, and I would recommend the Oompa-Loompa dance feature on the DVD to anyone... very fun)and I also loved the song that plays during the opening credits.<br/><br/>I loved the twist that was added where Willy Wonka had ""no family"", and how it was always difficult to say the word ""parents"".<br/><br/>A few of the jokes also make the movie as great as it is. Some may seem a little bit quirky or stupid at times, but they're guaranteed to make you laugh.<br/><br/>I would definitely recommend this movie... to anyone.

","Tim Burton has made it again with Johnny Depp, of course! Burton is one of my favorite director's mostly because he has his own voice. His world is so fantastically imaginative and beautiful. ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" is no exception.<br/><br/>""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" is based on the Danish author Roald Dahl's novel. Dahl wrote many so called children's books but the stories were full of society critic. Tim Burton has followed Dahl very accurately and he has saved the critical voice of Dahl. With a lot of black humor and jokes makes the movie more than enjoyable experience.<br/><br/>""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" tells the story of poor Charlie Bucket who is very intrigued by the mysterious Chocolate Factory rand by the peculiar man Willy Wonka. The Chocolate Factory is so mysterious because one one of the outside world never gets to go in and have a inside look of all the wonders of candy-making. Charlie's grandfather used to work in the Factory before Wonka fired everybody under the suspicions that someone has stoled he's secret recipes. Then suddenly Willy Wonka pronounces that he will make and include five golden tickets into the candy wrappers. The golden tickets can be found anywhere in the world. Five very fortunate children can get a peak inside the magic world of Willy Wonka... Charlie gets to be one of the lucky ones. The Children can have one accompanier; Charlie brings his grandfather who wants to go back to his former working place. What the children don't know is that they are put to the ultimate test...<br/><br/>The acting is very high quality. Johnny Depp makes an outstanding performance as a exuberant Willy Wonka. I read many articles of the fact that Willy Wonka resembles a lot of the pop-icon Michael Jackson with the very pale skin and odd behavior. I think it is just because Willy Wonka is a lonely man who invites young children to his factory just like M.Jackson used to do in his mansion ""Neverland"". There isn't any child offending facts in the Burton's movie.<br/><br/>The movie is full of sarcastic facts hidden beneath. Burton sort of mocks the society's problems like bad parenting etc.. If you give your child everything she or he wants will they ever learn to appreciate the little things in life? The script and the ground novel is very insightful and smart with lots of raving funny sequences.<br/><br/>The songs that are included to the movie as they are in the Dahl's book are composed by Danny Elfman who is responsible for many themes of Burton-movies. The lyrics are funny and educating.<br/><br/>Like in every good story there lies a lesson. If you have features that are pure gold and have a good heart you can achieve great riches. Having a lot of riches isn't the guarantee of happiness. Sure you can have a lots of earthly possession but if you don't have love you really don't anything.<br/><br/>If you are a parent I recommend you to watch it with your offspring because it is indeed very insightful and educating. The movie suits to everybody, an adult or a child but the film is filled with the little points that only the adults can fully understand."

","When I heard a remake was being done of this movie and that Depp was going to star in it I was optimistic. The book was good and the original movie was entertaining as a child, though incredibly dated visually. When I saw the first preview that optimism vanished and I was very disappointed by what I saw. That was reinforced by both the critics' reviews as well as the public reviews after the movie was released.<br/><br/>I opted to wait for it to arrive on DVD, and then only watched it when a friend loaned it to me, and I'm very happy that I didn't spend a penny on this. The movie was absolutely atrocious, and I can't for the life of me figure out how it has an average rating of 7.5 on IMDb. Every person I've ever talked to that has seen this movie did not like it. The movie is so bad that I really don't even know where to begin with a review! Suffice to say that I didn't even stick around to watch the ending, I called it quits about 3/4 of the way through the movie and I very rarely do that, especially if I'm watching a DVD.<br/><br/>The movie, at least what I saw of it, was pretty much word for word and scene for scene, identical to the original. The cast of characters was also the same. The Oompa Loompas looked to me to be digital copies of a single Oompa Loompa, but I'm not positive.<br/><br/>The biggest disappointment to me was Depp's portrayal of Willy Wonka. I really like him as an actor, and there are few movies he's put out that I haven't enjoyed, but I couldn't stand him in this movie. This is unfortunate because Willy Wonka is an interesting character that has a lot of potential for a good actor. I don't know how the character was written but Depp played it very effeminately, which seemed to me to just be weird, and not in a good way.<br/><br/>I could go on and on about all the disappointments of this movie, but it really just seems like a waste of time. Whatever you do, no matter how much you liked the book, the original movie, or Jonny Depp, don't pay a cent to see this.

The original, played by Gene Wilder was hilarious. I expected to get some comic relief out of the new remake of the children's classic. Sadly, this remake will stiff you, without a laugh and leave you wondering what the makers of this poor synopsis were even thinking. Computer graphics do not a classic make. Sorry Charlie, you can't make a Wonka factory out of Neverland Ranch."
"SlackerRus2000","2","3","6","20 May 2006"," This chocolate ain't as sweet as the originals recipe
","I don't understand it, why do people like Tim Burton? I mean, tell me a great film he did? He has done many good films including Edward Siccorhands and Big Fish. I guess people mistake his amazing artistic style with good directing, it is not. He has no sense of emotion in his films, no sense of pace, and no sense of musical style. Charlie and the chocolate factory had a brilliant artistic style except for his art direction in terms of the ""oompa-lumpas,"" which were pitiful compared to the originals. The most glaring fault of the film and what ruined it for me were the horrendous songs, while the original had many tunes which have lived through the ages, this version tried to ""modernize"" these tunes with terrible results. Since this is the heart of the film it utterly ruins the entire experience. The only saving grace of this film is johnny Depp's performance, which manages to make laughs from terrible dialogue and keeps you interested through its sheer spontaneity. In short, an awful film with another showpiece performance by Johnny Depp."
"marsala_lover","2","3","6","21 February 2006"," primitive movie with wrong ideas
","Stupid and primitive movie imposing wrong and corruptive ideas (like communistic) that all poor are good people and the riches are all spoiled, corrupted, bad, etc., who don't deserve all that richness and success they have, that all that is needed to be done is to give to a poor kind man a big successful enterprise and this would be a way to make the world better. How that looser Mr. Bucket (he is exactly like his father and Charlie's definitely gonna be the same)could run the factory if he was incapable to support his own family properly? How these poor kind people could make the world better if they are unable to make their own lives better?<br/><br/>And this is unbelievable that a twelve-year boy is happy with his family though they could not give him anything but a spoiled cap from toothpaste tube and a bar of chocolate once a year. He would be, if he didn't know that other children have normal dwelling, food, toys etc. Family love and support are VERY important, but they are just unable to compensate essentials and all other natural human (and children's) wants. Extremities shown in the movie are not convincing. <br/><br/>Johnny Depp is amusing, as usual. His acting (or rather making grimaces) is the only thing worth seeing in this movie."
"The_Only_Man_Who_Can","8","3","6","15 February 2006"," it's not a remake!
","Oh, how I wish people would stop calling Charlie and the Chocolate Factory a remake! Is Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings a remake of Baskshi's animated version? No. Is Baz Luhrmann's Romeo + Juliet an attempt to improve on Zefirelli's 1968 version? No. Why? Because the creators of each film used the original source material as inspiration. Why should 'Charlie' be any different? <br/><br/>I suppose there are two reasons. The first (sadly) seems to be that many are not aware that there was a book in the first place! It is apparent looking at some of the other comments that some believe Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory (with Gene Wilder) was an original creation (it might as well have been, as we'll see later). I grew up with Roald Dahl's books so I find it incomprehensible that one could argue that Burton 'changed the original' by (for example) replacing the golden geese with squirrels (as they are in the book). I don't see the new version to be an adaptation of anything but the original story as written by Roald Dahl.<br/><br/>The second reason is more understandable but also more subjective. There are obviously many, many people that adore the 70s adaptation, and will naturally be biased against the new one. To be fair, I'm exactly the same but the reverse. As a fan of the original story I couldn't wait to see the 70s version. However when I did I was... sorta... disappointed. The bland pastel colours (both inside and outside the factory) can't really be criticised for they are of it's time. But I just felt the film lacks the imagination, the spark, that Roald Dahl had. It's well recorded that Dahl wasn't pleased with what the filmmakers did with his story and I'm inclined to agree. My two main problems with the 70s version is that Wonka's factory just seems too much like an everyday factory with some decoration. The book makes gives you the sense that Wonka's factory is the most wonderful and surreal place on earth, even before the children enter it. Here, the chocolate river room is just a room with a chocolate river in it. All the rooms just seem like the pudding factory I worked at but with oompa-loompas. Where's the fun in that?! My other problem with the 70s version is actually how it ignores a subtle (but essential) message of the story. In the 70s version Gene Wilder famously explodes when Charlie steals Fizzly Lifting Drink and almost gets killed. After shouting at Charlie and his grandpa he tells them leave. When I saw this all I could think was 'Yeah! Wonka's right!' You see, Dahl's Charlie is different from the other children because he is polite, compassionate and trusts Wonka implicitly. The other children get their comeuppance for snatching at what they want; taking what Wonka explicitly tells them not to. What confuses me is that in the 70s version Charlie and Grampa do just this! THEY STEAL FIZZY LIFTING DRINK! They join the ranks of Augustus Gloop who drank from the river, Violet who took the unfinished gum, Veruca who wanted a golden goose/squirrel and Mike Teevee, a victim of his own impatience. If there was any justice, Charlie WOULD have been liquidised at the top of the Fizzy room but no, he gets the factory and I'm left thinking 'why didn't the others?' <br/><br/>So, that's why I believe that for all it's faults, Tim Burton's Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is at least an original and earnest attempt to bring the magic of Dahl's original story to the screen, morals (and the original songs) intact. While Depp's Wonka understandably divides audiences, I prefer it to Wilder's schizophrenic tired/angry psycho approach, as Depp made me really believe that this eccentric had been cut off from the real world for years. I think Dahl would have approved"
"kej624","10","3","6","26 January 2006"," Tim Burton is a genius
","I want to preface my statements by stating that I have not been a big fan of Tim Burton movies. However after seeing this movie I can say he is a incredible director. Once the movie went to DVD I immediately went out to purchase it. My two-year-old son has practically memorized the whole movie...oompah-looms dances and all! It is a wonderful remake of a great movie. Johnny Depp and Deep Roy should receive HUGE bonuses for their performances. The 2005 version of Willie Wonka did nothing to diminish the original performance of Gene Wilder and I commend Johnny Depp and Tim Burton. All in all this is a wonderful movie that the whole family will enjoy for years to come! I would recommend it to everyone."
"unakaczynski","10","3","6","23 January 2006"," Among Johnny Depp's best work.
","Charlie and the Chocolate Factory Fantasy/Comedy 2005<br/><br/>I really want to get on with this review, so I'll sum up the synopsis part quick as can besince we're all familiar with it anyway: Quirky, reclusive owner of the greatest candy factory in the world, Willy Wonka, has just sent out five golden tickets to allow five children to tour his factory with a surprise at the end for the child that impresses Mr. Wonka the best during the tour. Okay, we all know how this movie goeseven if we haven't seen it. We've seen the original or one of the millions of times it's been mentioned, referenced, or parodied over the years in places like the television shows ""Futurama"" and ""Family Guy."" So let's get on with it:<br/><br/>Here's the breakdown:<br/><br/>The Good:<br/><br/>--For anyone worried that ""Hollywood Elite"" status has ruined Johnny Depp, worry not. Everything about this movie could suck and it would still be watchable just because of him! His acting is brilliant, fantastic, hilarious. He injects mannerisms and attitude into Willy Wonka that are impossible to hate. And some of them are so minor: When everyone's boarding the boat on the chocolate river, the mother of one of the children is very obviously attracted to Willy Wonka and creepily trying to impress him. The disgusted and nervous way Johnny Depp says ""All aboard"" is immensely subtle, but still laugh-out-loud funny. Sure, Gene Wilder was brilliant in this role, but hellit's like it was always meant for Johnny Depp. He doesn't mind looking funny or acting sillyin fact, he seems to revel in itand the audience receives some of the best entertainment we're likely to find in any movie these days. Everything about Johnny Depp's portrayal of Willy Wonka is sheer perfection. Subtle mannerisms, weird joking, his joyful disdain of the rotten children, his looks, attitudeeverything. He is this movie.<br/><br/>--Okay, that said, the rest of the acting was also quite gooda real plus from the boy playing Charlie. He's likable and heart-warming. The other kids? Just as obnoxious as can bewhich is just the way they're supposed to be.<br/><br/>--Classic, great story.<br/><br/>--Generally excellent compositing and special effects work, even if it is all CG. CG work these days is getting more and more obvious for some reason, and more and more overused. Now, while that is the case here, there are still some very impressive sets and not all the CG is obvious. It's better looking that, say, 95% of the films released the past few years.<br/><br/>--Absolutely fantastic setsclassic Tim Burton. Dreamy and detailed. <br/><br/>--Danny Elfman's music is as brilliant as always.<br/><br/>--After watching this film, it's hard to imagine the Chocolate Factory without Depp, Burton, and Elfman making it what it is. And it's damn near impossible to put into words just how it looks and feels. <br/><br/>--Excellent dialog, especially (of course) from Depp. ""Everything in this room is eatableeven me. But that, children, is called cannibalism and is frowned upon in most modern societies."" Sure, this is zany writing, but what really makes it memorable is the way Depp delivers all these lines.<br/><br/>--This is a family movie that can actually be enjoyed by adults. A lot of them are billed stating that they can be enjoyed by adults, like ""Madagascar"" for instancebut are still too childish. My son is two years old and he couldn't take his eyes off the screen for most of it. And I loved this movie through and through. We have a rarity herewhole families actually can enjoy this one!<br/><br/>--Excellent writing, and great comedy moments. This is the best thing Tim Burton has done in years.<br/><br/>--Tons of cheesinessbut the good kind. The kind that makes the movie fun. You'll see<br/><br/>--The Oompa Loompas are all the same little guy. He was Mr. Soggybottom in Burton's ""Big Fish.""<br/><br/>Didn't Hurt It, Didn't Help:<br/><br/>--The songs by the Oompa Loompas are a far cry different from those of the original film. Some people may not be too keen on this. All of them themed differentlylike, there's a Disco song and an 80's Hair Metal/Hard Rock song (which constantly reminds us of Van Halen and Quiet Riot) to name a couple.<br/><br/>The Bad:<br/><br/>--Unfortunately, it's another remake in a remake-heavy era of Hollywood.<br/><br/>--A tad over-reliant on computer graphics work. Didn't ruin the movie, but I think it's time that production artists get off the computers and into the studios again.<br/><br/>The Ugly:<br/><br/>--The four children that aren't Charlie.<br/><br/>Memorable Scene:<br/><br/>--Any time Depp speaks.<br/><br/>Acting: 10/10 (Johnny Depp deserves even higher) Story: 10/10 Atmosphere: 10/10 Cinematography: 10/10 Character Development: 10/10 Special Effects/Make-up: 9/10 Nudity/Sexuality: 0/10 Violence: 2/10 (very minor comic shenanigans) Gore: 0/10 Dialogue: 10/10 Music: 10/10 Direction: 10/10 <br/><br/>Cheesiness: 5/10 Crappiness: 0/10 <br/><br/>Overall: 10/10<br/><br/>So there you have it. It's one of the best movies made in the last year. Perhaps, in the last few years. It's certainly the best remake in well in ages (and I've seen King Kong 2005). It's different enough to make the original with Gene Wilder still well worth owning and loving. However, Depp surpasses Wilder in the role, in my opinion. In the original, Gene Wilder shares the spotlight with the brilliant factory and wacky visuals. Here, everythingthe other actors, the scenery, the musiceverything is second string to Depp's compelling, and brilliant performanceamong the best he's ever done. It really feels like, all these years, ever since the story was writtenit was always intended for Johnny Depp and Tim Burton. Watch it.<br/><br/>www.ResidentHazard.com"

","I loved this version very much. I especially liked the spicy Grandpa George and the spacey Grandma Georgina. I have new respect for Mr Wonka after the explanation via increasing flashbacks of his childhood. I understand why he's so strange. Deep Roy as ALL of the Oompa Loompas was a surprise and not as disappointing as I've heard from the ""peanut gallery."" Johnny Depp was superb. Danny Elfman was a perfect candidate for the music :) I just loved every part of this movie from every character to every scene. The only question I had was, ""Wouldn't you be screaming and/or shrieking during the boat ride...or at least have a 'roller coaster ride' reaction?"" All in all, I give it an 11 out of 10! Favorite lines: ""I love grapes!"" Grandma Georgina rocks!"
"Tombalaya","10","3","6","8 January 2006"," This was the biggest surprise and enjoyable ride of a film I have ever seen.
","When I watched the previews of this film I was full of so much doubt. I thought the scenes would be freaky, even freakier than some of the scenes in the original (A GIANT LOBSTER! SWEET FANCY MOSES!), and I thought that Johnny Depp would not do well at all as the famous chocolatier. I remember hearing myself say ""I am going to stay away from that movie as much as possible. TIm Burton made it so it has a good chance of making me wet my bed at night"" well, I actually said the first half, but until this movie I believed the second half. This movie was soooooooooooo much fun. It has the perfect blend of humor, aesthetic images, and bizzareness. There was a thrill in seeing something new, exciting, peculiar, humorous....I felt like I was on an amusement park ride. I didn't want it to end. I also felt like eating candy until my navel blew out like a party favor. <br/><br/>Johnny Depp is hilarious, and even though he as Willy Wonka was strange, he prevents the movie from exploding into particles of confusion, and creates a peculiar sense of sanity with his sarcastic comments. TIm Burton kept the movie true to the book, and made it a visual masterpiece. the special effects were absolutely incredible. It definitely contends with Narnia, Kong, and Episode III in the effects race. The Willy Wonka factory is much more believable as a pioneer in candy innovations in this film than in the original (punching gloves to pound flour? I mean, come on.) One of best parts was the oompa loompas, their songs, the fact that they weren't orange with green hair, and the fact that they were all played by one actor. Even the voices in the songs were voiced by only Danny Elfman, who is also the score writer. The songs were catchy, fun, rockin, funky, and hip. Whoa, I feel old, I just said a song was hip. anyone have any prune juice?<br/><br/>Overall this movie was absolutely amazing. I will never judge a film based on on what creepy things its director has done in the past. I love and recommend this movie. Those who haven't are missing a fun, SWEET time. yes pun intended."
"rainking_es","8","3","6","9 January 2006"," Amusing.
","A nice adaptation from Roal Dahl's story that had been already adapted in the 70's by the Disney factory and with the great Gene Wilder playing the main role. We could debate about why Tim Burton has gone into remakes lately, if that means that the muses have left him, that he has lost his ""touch"". Yeah, we could cry over him and complain... but what for? That's life! <br/><br/>This brand new Willy Wonka is just matchless, Burton has wisely used the technical advances and he's put them at the service of this amusing story. The colors, the psychedelia, the laughing, the tenderness and (as in any fable) the moral: in Wonka's world the richest, the selfish and vain people, they all lose. The biggest difference between this adaptation and the Disney one is in the Willy Wonka's character. This time we're told about his past, we know more details about him and why he acts the way he does (there are several flash-backs that shows us Willy as a child).<br/><br/>As for the actors, Johnny Depp is the boss here. It should've been a big mistake to try to imitate Gene Wilder's creation, so Johnny has released his most histrionic instincts and he's got a bull's eye. The rest of the cast is just perfect, but as I've said before, Johnny is the true (and only) starring in ""Charlie and the chocolate factory"".<br/><br/>*My rate: 7.5/10"
"pinkcttncandy0","3","3","6","14 December 2005"," Fan of the Old Version
","Twas OKAY. I am a big fan of the original remake, thus I knew that by choosing to see this movie, I was either in for a treat or a I wasn't. Just like how I cannot stand the Harry Potter movies, I couldn't stand this 2nd remake either. To me, the first remake just feels like the original. But I am the type who gets used to things and then when I see something different, it's got to be Super, or my heart will not connect with it. And it didn't with this movie. I think that nothing was wrong with the persona Depp tried to create, it was just how the did it that didn't make that persona shine through. So maybe it's not his fault, but the writer's fault.<br/><br/>As for the plot, it was entertaining up to Charlie and the winners standing in front of Wonka's gate. Once Wonka showed up, it went downhill. The OompaLoompas, to me, were annoying (their songs, their dances, them). The ending was not heartfelt."
"DanZ28","Null","3","6","13 November 2005"," Astonishing
","Tim Burton and Johnny Depp both do a wonderful job in this movie. Johnny Depps performance as Willy Wonka was outstanding and very inventive. I thought that his take on the Wonka character was much better than Wilders. Tim Burton really did a good job in this film. He created such an amazing atmosphere. Freddie Highmore was very good as Charlie. I thought that he and Depp made a closer connection with their two characters. The oompa loompas were very funny in this film. I felt that this movie was better than the older version (although i love the older version). Johnny Depp and Tim Burton should definitely continue to make movies together.<br/><br/>It is a wonderful and imaginative film. It truly is astonishing."
"yourbigpalal83","Null","3","6","4 November 2005"," An abomination of the classic
","I hate to say this, especially to a well reviewed film, but i simply didn't like this film and i felt almost insulted by the way it came off. Don't get me wrong, The kid who played Charlie was'nt bad at all, but compared to the classic i grew up watching, it just was horrible.<br/><br/>Granted i know how the author of the book hated the movie, and the 1971 film didn't exactly follow the book to a T, but this film, even though it follows the book, just came off as weird, disturbing and overall poor compared to the classic Gene Wilder film. Also the Umpa Loopas were weird, Not the fault of actor, but how they were presented. I mean, if they were from a weird tribe, why would they look all EXACTLEY ALIKE? if they were a clone work force, that be different, but they were from a tribe, and idk about u but to me I've never seen a tribe on National Geographic or Discovery Channel in which each member looked exactly the same.<br/><br/>Now, i am noting that it is the ""Tim Burton version"" which means it comes with its own visual style and flair which to me is aether hit or miss, but, compared to the toung and cheek 1971 version, it just couldn't compare. Don't get me wrong, I'm all for Computer animation and special effects, hell I'm even studying them in college with the goals of being an animator, but this film just didn't need to be made.<br/><br/>in closing, on its own, i guess its an OK film. But compared to the classic, its an abomination."
"freakyteenager666","10","3","6","20 October 2005"," Not a remake but an amazing retake on a classic
","I really, really can't say anything bad about this retake of the classic children's novel everything about this movie wow me is like in the real world is so normal and in Wonka's factory everything is very colorful and well match to the book and Johnny Depp's role of Willy Wonka was really funny everything about it was funny in a very good way and I loved how the five children were in this movie my favorite kid is Violet and Augustus and the Ommpa Loompa's I'll always think they're cool and the CGI is amazing and I don't even like CGI with the scenes like Violet turning into a big blueberry glued me on the screen and the retake on the songs I like as well my favorite song is Veruca Salt. I like everything about this movie.<br/><br/>One of Tim Burton's greatest work yet!"
"ActionManFan","7","3","6","19 October 2005"," Surprisingly good.
","Not the most exciting of films but it wasn't as boring as I was expecting it to be. I do think it was at risk of being a failure because the first version of Willy Wonka was pretty much famous. And trying to live up to that first version was a real challenge.<br/><br/>But it was entertaining and fun to watch, a great example of a classic family movie. Johnny Depp as always played the role of Willy Wonka marvellously and added to the comedy of the film but also played the heart-warming moments really well.<br/><br/>If you are looking for a film to watch with young people, I recommend this one. I wasn't blown away by the story lines and the character performances but I also wasn't too bored of it.<br/><br/>I'm sure lots of movie fans will agree it is not as successful as the original film but it's a hit with the kids which is good to know.<br/><br/>I applaud Johnny Depp for yet another great leading role. And also the actors who played the children made me laugh quite a lot, this movie will be sure to leave you feeling happier and it provides a nice break from the stresses of everyday life. Enjoy it and have a giggle. I give it a 7/10."
"drgreenstein","6","3","6","28 September 2005"," Good effort
","As expected Tim Burton's visual presentation and Johnny Depp's performance are quite pleasing. The story and acting that take place outside the factory are top-notch and very entertaining. Unfortunately, the time spent in the factory is not quite up to par. Depp's speech pattern becomes reminiscent of ""The Church Lady"" from SNL. The visual props become second rate. The ride on the chocolate river features a boat that you might find in a child's cereal box. The candy meadow seems filled with green plastic strands. Overall, the movie's fun for those who are Wonka or Burton fans but clearly not the best movie that either could make. Cheers to Freddie Highmore starring as Charlie. He is superb in his role."

","Willy Wonka (Johnny Depp), the owner of a biggest chocolate factory in the world, put five golden ticket randomly in his Wonka Bars inviting the holders to come for one day tour in his mysterious factory. For poor Charlie Bucket (Freddie Highmore), who can only gets a Wonka Bar once a year on his birthday, the chances for a ticket are extremely slim. But good thing always come to the one with good heart. At the last day, Charlie won the chance to join 4 other children from all around the world; the spoiled Veruca Salt (Julia Winter), the competitive Violet Beauregard (Annasophia Robb); the fat Augustus Gloop (Philip Wiegartz) and the violent Mike Teavee (Jordon Fry). Together they start their journey in the magnificent Willy Wonka's factory.<br/><br/>Tim Burton is great! He successfully created a visual that seems a combination of real and unreal. This movie also features an outstanding performance by all casts. Johnny Depp gives us an eccentric genius but innocent Willy Wonka, Freddie Highmore is a perfect Charlie, and the four other children and their parents are fit in their role as amusing irritating characters : D This movie also good in playing with emotions. We all know that Charlie's gonna find the ticket, but you just can't stop your heart from beat faster when the time is come. What I like least about this movie is the Oompa Loompas' songs. I don't know why I got scary feeling about them :( But I can say that this movie is greatly enjoyable. Nothing could be sweeter. Well done!"
"nenaaleksic","10","3","6","5 September 2005"," Highly amusing!
","Last Sunday I watched ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" and I found it really worth seeing. It has all chances of becoming Tim Burton's next blockbuster! It completely attracted my children's (7 and 9) attention! Having been famous for his previous films, especially the ""Batman"", Burton chooses the well known novel of Roald Dahl to make the plot of his newest performance. Charlie, a smart, well-behaving ten-year old boy, lives in a small, more then a humble house at the suburb. His parents can afford him just one chocolate a year, as a birthday present. In the neighborhood there is a chocolate factory owned by Willy Wonka, who makes the best candies in the world. By chance Charlie finds a banknote in the street and buys himself a chocolate. As expected, he shares it with his grandparents and parents. The most exciting event comes when he finds a golden ticket (one of the five in the world) in the chocolate which enables him to visit the chocolate factory and eventually gain the special price. Wonka is played by Johnny Depp, whose interpretation of an odd, strictly raised dentist's son is hugely impressive. He successfully fights with some consequences of psychical injuries dating back to his childhood and joins his new family in the end. Although apparently superficial, the film is profoundly moving, especially when dealing with family relations. At first the Chocolate factory might be considered a film for children due to the tiny dwarfs working at the factory, and fairy tale appearance scenery, but in my opinion, it must be highly amusing to anyone who likes stories in which the good win and the bad lose. So, let's go and see it again!"
"tredwater13","9","3","6","4 September 2005"," Burton has done it again
","Well, again Tim Burton has proved what a wonderful imagination he has, with his remake of the Roald Dahl classic; Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. The movie has everything, a great story, wonderful dialogue, and most importantly, great characters! On some factors, it differs in ways from the book, but Tim Burton definitely knows what audiences want, and these added in subplots are amazing, with the extra depth they bring to the film.<br/><br/>Freddie Highmore does an incredible job of portraying the young Charlie Bucket, immediately pulling strings with the audience, adults and children alike. Johnny Depp, as always, is magnificent in his role as the eccentric Willy Wonka. His character development throughout the film provides the audience with a character not so much whom they can relate to, but rather, one who they cannot bear to wait for the next piece of his dialogue. Everything that comes out of Depp's mouth in the film has been written to entrance and entertain, without any over-the-top rude or shocking remarks, a great challenge in todays world of 'shock comedy' as I once heard it referred to. The film's other characters are equally well written, and serve their purpose well, that is, to be disliked by the audience through the entire length of the movie. The Oompa Loompas deserve a critique of their own. The actors amazing ability to be funny and solemn at the same time is great! And the songs, well, as with everything else in the movie, they have been well written. The only criticism of this movie that i have is the ending, Burton did not follow Dahl's original idea for the movie, and instead finishes it, whereas, i believe this movie would have had great interest in a potential sequel, with Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator. It is possible for anyone, any age to see this movie and enjoy it, and if you cant smile at least once, all i can say is where is your sense of humour?"
"sal_sarmini","9","3","6","2 September 2005"," Much better than first
","So I've spoken to a lot of people ( some who haven't even seen the film ) and it seems that while there's been those who welcome Tim Burton's adaptation of Roald Dahl's book, there's a general consensus that ""..oh, but you can never replace the original.."". Well, bloody hell, no one is trying to replace, or even remake, the original film. Its an ADAPTATION of the BOOK people, so stop being so damn precious about the original. No one is doubting the grandiosity of the first adaptation, and this version is not trying to replace it.. its just catering for audiences over 12 years old... Having said that, it is an absolutely fantastic film, much much much better than the first and one that will keep the audience feeling uneasy with its sugar-sweet dark quirkiness. Johnny Depp takes Willy Wonka to places Gene Wilder could never dream of..and this version is much more faithful to the book. SO, for cynics i have this advice.. watch the first on video and then see Burton's in the cinema..and if you're still not convinced, then read the bloody book so you can prove to yourself which film does it more justice."

","As I am a great fan of Johnny Depp and my favorite Director is Tim Burton(When I first witnessed his work on Edward Scissorhands)I had to see this film! I noticed it was much more detailed than the first...showing more extensive detail in the Bucket's lifestyle and home I began to think they were never going to get to the Factory! I did enjoy how once they got to the factory the Oompa Loopma's songs changed unlike the same dull tune you get stuck in your head for weeks from the first one! I liked how they showed what the children did once they got out(IE: Veruca covered in garbage..)Then how they showed Wonka's past during the factory tour.(I had felt so bad when I saw he was deprived of chocolate and had to wear that awful headgear!) Then how once they got out Wonka was outside of the Factory..I didn't like how the first was so based on the Factory itself Thus I give this movie 8.9/10 (It kind of broke my heart learning there was only ONE Oompa Loompa)"
"ry33guy-1","10","3","6","24 August 2005"," The summer's biggest hit...and rightfully so.
","Wow. As Danny Elfman's so-sweet-sounding-it's-sinister theme says: ""Willy Wonka HERE HE IS!"" And here he is, for sure. This is Willy Wonka with a new and thrilling twist, and it's Tim Burton and Johnny Depp in all their celebrated creative glory.<br/><br/>Tim Burton, of course, does not have a perfect track record. A self-proclaimed Burton fan myself, I admit that previous efforts such as Mars Attacks, Batman/Batman Returns, and Planet of the Apes were all lacking in fundamental areas (particularly the abysmal Apes). But when Burton is on, he's on. His triumphs (Edward Scissorhands, The Nightmare Before Christmas, Sleepy Hollow, and the grossly underrated Big Fish) all showcase a special blend of whimsy, carefully crafted visual atmosphere, humor, and dramatic tension that is distinctly Burtonesque. Add Charlie and the Chocolate Factory to the list.<br/><br/>Burton's vision is, I believe, faithful to Dahl's. This doesn't mean, of course, that it matches every Dahl fan's visualization of the novel. What it does mean is that if Burton read the book, this is what he would see. How great it is to see his imagination building off of Dahl's. They're a great match.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp plays Wonka in a way that no one could have expected, but his risky portrayal does NOT come across as a pretentious actor trying to impress everyone with his versatility in a role that does not call for it. Here Depp displays real brilliance, because he does something completely unexpected and not only pulls it off, but makes the film. This is even more impressive considering that, prior to his introduction, the film is so enjoyable he almost seems unnecessary.<br/><br/>As usual, Elfman's soundtrack is the perfect complement to Burton's visuals. He even succeeds in making something as benign as chocolate bars appear menacing in the opening credit sequence. The Oompa Loompa songs are also very enjoyable, because both Burton and Elfman know how to present them in a tongue-and-cheek manner that keeps them from being corny.<br/><br/>Not to mention that the simple message of the story is an important one for both young and old. This is a morality play without any subtlety, and that's OK. The kids get what's coming to them, and Charlie gets what's coming to him. Still, it's not preachy or sickeningly sweet. As Wonka would demand, it mixes the ingredients just right to create something truly delicious.<br/><br/>This is Burton, Depp, and Elfman at the top of their game. I'm glad it has been recognized as the summer's biggest hit, an honor it truly deserves. With ""The Corpse Bride"" less than a month away, 2005 really looks to be an outstanding year for Burton. 10/10!"

","It's just what you'd expect from Tim Burton and Roald Dahl. The combination of director and author is perfect - and so is the film. It's not Tim Burton's best but it's absolutely worth the way to the movie theatre. If you like Big Fish or Nightmare Before Christmas, you'll love this one. It's colourful, weird enough to love it, and at the same time very carefully composed. The sweetness of the chocolate seems to ""infect"" the whole movie. All gestures and words seem to be carefully chosen without trying to make it annoyingly perfect. All the ideas, the author's as well as the director's, make you smile and wonder how someone can actually create such a wonderful yet strange atmosphere. Despite all the sweetness, there is some bitterness and some melancholy in this picture which is marvelously acted out by Johnny Depp as Willy Wonka. Charlie is that perfect kid without being in whatsoever way annoying. It's a lovely film and it would be a ten if it wasn't for Sleepy Hollow or Edward."
"terminator-3","9","3","6","24 August 2005"," What a refreshing change! Nice to see something good in the cinema again.
","I grew up with the original film (never growing tired of it), and I always loved Gene Wilder's acting. I had also read the books, so I was very dubious about a new film, considering some of the remakes that have left a bad taste. I read reviews that said it was not a remake, but a new interpretation of the story. As the film started, I did not at first know what to make of it. It did not take long though to realise that I was watching something special. Depp is nothing short of brilliant in the role of Wonka. I have not laughed so much in a long time. His constant ""Mumbling"" comments to Mike TV in response to his baffling scientific statements was hilarious. Also the line ""You're weird!"" had me in stitches.<br/><br/>Tim Burtons sets and use of colour were great. It had a slight feel of ""Edward Scissor Hands"".<br/><br/>All of the cast were brilliant. The Oompa Lumpas were different to the originals, but still very funny. It was also nice to see Christopher Lee again on the big screen.<br/><br/>I always ranked the original film as a children's classic along with ""The Wizard of Oz"", ""Chitty, Chitty, Bang, Bang"" or ""Mary Poppins"" etc.., but I must say that this new film has earned it's place in this hall of fame.<br/><br/>I will definitely buy the DVD when it comes out."

First time seeing it was a couple of days ago, coming back from Belgium, on the overnight ferry from Zeebrugge to Hull, on the small on-board cinema. It was thoroughly amazing and hilariously funny. Roald Dahl, Tim Burton, Danny Elfman, Johnny Depp... what COULD be better? I challenge someone to, please: tell me the answer to that question! I was so happy that it was on the ferry that I actually danced... and that was before I even saw it... when I came out of the cinema, I had a smile to rival that of a really smiley person... for lack of a better simile."

","I have to admit, I went into the movie thinking that Depp's interpretation of Wonka would irritate me to the point of being unable to enjoy the movie. That judgment was only based on the commercials, and the ""Willie Wonka, Willie Wonka, he's a something something guy..."" song that would play in the background.<br/><br/>The truth is, as usual, Depp was dead on. WAAAY over the top, as he does so well - so far over that it brings it back again. It can't really be explained - only experienced.<br/><br/>(And if you are planning to experience it, I recommend Imax. If you do it, do it right.)<br/><br/>The story is well-known, although I've never read the book, I'm told it is more true to the original story than the first. The ending was a slightly different take, and in my opinion, better. I was pleasantly surprised.<br/><br/>The movie was so good that I almost wished I had never seen the first one, so that the story would also be new to me. The sets are as good as you'd expect from the man who creates entire universes for his characters to inhabit. Costumes, casting - all perfect. I don't know what else Augustus Gloop is going to play, since he was obviously born for this role.<br/><br/>I'd like to see it again, to watch more closely Wonka's reaction to the kids. There was some subtlety in his expressions that bears a repeat view. It's possible I'm over-analyzing, but my experience has been that most of Depp's characters do have several levels, and it's worth finding them.<br/><br/>The only part of the movie I wasn't crazy about were the songs. The Oompa Loompah songs were OK, but not great. Confusing, more than anything, since I couldn't quite understand what they were saying. They seemed weird for the sake of weirdness, although one could say that about the whole movie. The rest of the weirdness just works better I suppose.<br/><br/>All in all, I'm glad I saw it. And I got the T-Shirt. :)"

","Went into this film to condemn it really - why make another when there was nothing wrong with the last one. However - how my opinion changed - superb all round character portrayed by the talented Mr Depp - just enough humour not to turn it into a circus and added extras which show the wonderful imagination of Mr Burton. Much closer to the book as well which is always a bonus.<br/><br/>Young Freddie also did a sterling job as Charlie - he had indeed grown in ability as well as in age following finding Neverland. Johnny Depp has also shown his versatility - having children himself has enabled him to relate to an audience of many ages - he's not just the good looking one(although he is arguably one of the most appealing men on the planet)he created the perfect Willy Wonka for children."

I did miss however the importance of finding the golden ticket, I think that this film did not make as much of as it should have. The new songs from the om pa loom pa's were great and I would think more attractive to the kids of today.

"Madhatter346","8","3","6","16 August 2005"," WOW! This movie is a real treat to one's eyes and it has the books dark spirit in it.
","Well, all I can say bravo Burton. You have pulled of one spectacular movie. This movie has a rich, deep story and it doesn't leave with a hollow feeling like ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"" did. Well this movie pleased me so much because of its Characters, Music, Environment and for the dark feeling you get from it. -CHARACTERS- Augustus Gloop: Perfect acting. Greedy, messy and a little rude. Wonderful, identical to the book (If you notice in the first movie Augustus is merely chubby, while here he fat, obese just like in the book) Veruca Salt: Although Julia Winter didn't scream as much as Julie Dawn Cole, she was a hypocrite (when she gets her ticket she smiles for like 3 seconds and then she asks her daddy for another pony) and her ""friendship"" with Violet=amusing, though it was short and useless it was funny. Violet Beauregarde: Just perfect, simply wonderful. Self centered, rude and stuck up, these are the ingredients used to make a perfect Violet. (and she got huge, and her face got fat when she turned into a blueberry, while in the first one she just got fat and blue and grew 3 centimeters) Mike Teavee: What can I say, he wasn't exactly like in the book, but hey they had to make him different because nobody carries around 18 guns, but people do spend lots of time in front of a TV or a Gaming System and they know a lot about hacking or computers. So Mike Teavee=average boy who is a little extra obsessed with TVs, Games and computers. Besides he even had a key ingredient, which was in the book, and this ingredient is the fact that he was trying to show how intelligent he was and he was a little more because he thought Wonka was an idiot and that everything in the factory was pointless and stupid. Charlie Bucket: Freddie Highmore did a spectacular job because he gave Charlie that sense of innocence and sweetness. He acted as if he really almost never ate chocolate (he took small bites of everything so he could enjoy it more) and he was always polite and he proved that a bond with your family is unbreakable. He was always trying to help and was always willing to share and give up something for others. Charlie also showed how much he loved Wonka's candy with the wrappers hanging in his room and with the toothpaste chocolate factory. Willy Wonka: Johnny Depp has done it again he has portrayed a perfect character, Johnny Depp is Willy Wonka. He showed Wonka as a lonely, sad, eccentric, freaky man, and yet he still proves Wonka is a genius. He really shows Wonka has some problems and once he solves them you feel like you have learned more of Wonka and that gap you had before is filled, even if that little subplot wasn't in the book it made a nice addition. The Grandparents were wonderful and so were the children's parents. The Oompa Loompas: Good job Deep Roy, he played all the Oompa Loompas (of course he was multiplied) and he did a great job. The dances in the songs were great and, well Deep Roy is just such a good actor that he is the living image of what the Oompa Loompas were suppose to be from the beginning. Also there is the fact that they look so human that they really fit in the jungle as the were. -MUSIC- Danny Elfman you are the KING! He has done such a good job creating this eerie music for every environment and for every scene. I loved the whole ""every child has a different type of music for their respective song"" idea because it was just great. You never knew what would come next. The different voice tones as they changed randomly made a perfect addition to the songs. -ENVIRONMENT AND FEELINGS- Well the environment was clearly dark and twisted. The chocolate was always dark and the giant candy cane was twisted and the boat ride was because the music and the light effects. Now as for the feelings I got a sense of cruelty from the Oompa Loompas because they sang nasty songs about nasty, naughty children in front of their parents(a wee bit cruel!) and the candy garden it was a little cruel of Burton and Elfman to switch the music to evil every time Augustus appeared, and they did that in quite a few other scenes with the other children. I was a little shocked at how loud the music was and how crude it was, but that's what made it cool (after every song the parent of the child who the song was about always looked at Wonka with hatred in their face. -OVERALL- A superb movie worth every penny and second, worth seeing more than once and definitely buying the DVD."

","I'd heard lots of other people say that Charlie is ""weird"" in this version of the movie - people who think this just don't get it.... or haven't read the book. <br/><br/>It is a classic Tim Burton movie and Depp is at his best. The make-up, the outfits, the warped humour..... it's all there. The build-up to the actual factory visit is excellent, we were all gripped and excited, like we could actually win a ticket ourselves!!! <br/><br/>The only negative thing I have to say about this movie is that I thought the Oompa-Loompa singing sections went on a bit too long although they were brilliantly done (I don't know anyone who likes singing in a movie!). <br/><br/>The effects are superb to delight the kids and the grown-ups will love the humour.

","Although by commercials you may see Johnny Depp as Willy Wonka looking like Michael Jackson in Candy Land. But as the movie goes on, you will grow to love his sensational quirkiness.<br/><br/>This movie is a remake of the 1971 hit, ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory,"" created from the beloved book, ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,"" written by Roald Dahl. In the movie, Oscar nominated star Johnny Depp reunites with talented youngster, Freddie Highmore, (Finding Neverland) in this heartwarming story.<br/><br/>Charlie Bucket(Highmore) is a nice young boy, who lives with his mom and dad, and four grandparents. When word is out that the famous chocolate maker, Willy Wonka, (Depp) has released 5 golden tickets in 5 ordinary chocolate bars, which would give the buyers a chance to enter into his wonderful factory, Charlie's Grandfather (David Kelly) is determined that Charlie get one of these tickets. On one lucky day, Charlie discovers 10 bucks on the side of the road, and uses it to buy a Wonka Chocolate Bar, and finds the last golden ticket.<br/><br/>Alongside his grandfather, Charlie and 4 other kids from around the world, get the wonderful chance to enter into Willy Wonka's magnificent factory. Charlie quickly finds that the other 4 children who won the golden tickets, are not as kind as he is...and also that Willy Wonka is about one of the strangest men to walk to planet...<br/><br/>But overall this movie I thought was brilliant. The recreation of the Oompa Loompa's (all played by Deep Roy) will have everyone laughing, especially at their very entertaining songs. The story is not exactly the same as the original movie, so surprises will be in store, and the set direction and lines of this movie fit perfectly together, along with the actors who play each character.<br/><br/>I highly recommend seeing this movie in theaters, because the theater experience would be much more rewarding than watching it on an ordinary television screen. This is a masterpiece, and a personal favorite of mine."
"TheNorthernMonkee","4","3","6","10 August 2005"," weak remake with bad jokes, awkward moments and only the occasional highlight
","SPOILERS Tim Burton has a remarkably inconsistent record. When his films are good, they are often amazing ('Nightmare Before Christmas', 'Beetlejuice', 'Batman'), but when they are bad, people go out looking for blood (the abomination 'Planet of the Apes'). In 2005 therefore there is an element of trepidation about this remake of the Roald Dahl classic. Casting regular star and current Hollywood golden boy Johnny Depp as Wonka, Burton takes multiple gambles as he retells the story like only he can. Sadly though, just like his 'reimagining' of 'Planet of the Apes', Burton's Wonka tale is an awkward affair with little going for it and only the briefest of inspirational moments.<br/><br/>Charlie Bucket (Freddie Highmore) lives with his parents (Helena Bonham Carter and Noah Taylor) and four grandparents in a run down house with cabbage soup on the menu daily. Receiving a chocolate bar every year for his birthday, Charlie is hopeful for the future at the news that the eccentric Willy Wonka (Depp) is inviting five children into his chocolate factory for a guided tour. With one chocolate bar and insurmountable odds of success, can a miracle truly happen for the young Bucket? This is Roald Dahl, of course it can! Right from the outset, the film sets out where it means to go on with a chocolate based opening credits. Taking us to Tim Burton's world, everything about the environment is pure Burton style. The Bucket house is almost straight out of 'Big Fish' and the clothes of everyone involved are predominately 'The Nightmare before Christmas'. The general outlook of the film is one of abstract weird and to be honest, it does look beautiful.<br/><br/>Unfortunately however, once you look beneath the surface of the film, a different story emerges. There's no denying that what Burton has created here is magnificent in appearance, and with subtle directions he does create some memorable moments (Wonka randomly discarding a business card the second he receives it for example). The problem we have though is that the script just isn't up to much.<br/><br/>In this adaption of Dahl's story, there are just far too many weak moments. Whether it's the overplayed poverty of the Bucket family or the tormented past of Wonka, just too many bits feel forced. The jokes are often awkward and unfunny, the feel just doesn't click, and all too often Johnny Depp's Wonka is written and played as if he is the twin of a recently 'innocent' pop-star.<br/><br/>One part of the story which is particularly infuriating is the back history of Willy Wonka. An interesting take on the notion, this story, presented in flashback form (leading to Depp looking memorably into nothingness and thus encouraging you to see him as weird) tells of Wonka's past differences with his dentist father (Christopher Lee). This notion and the general all round feel, could have been handled so well and really added to this film, but the script is so haphazard and awkward that you really don't care about this dysfunctional family and you just want to get back to the present day.<br/><br/>Perhaps the worst part about this modern adaptation is the way Burton, writer John August and composer Danny Elfman have teamed together to destroy the Oompa Loompas. Whilst the racial undertones of having them as the vertically challenged orange men again are obvious, surely a better solution could have been found rather than what we have here. Giving us Deep Roy multiple times as every single member of this tiny species, the film's main musical focal point is destroyed when we are given inconsistent, toneless and often irritating songs for each of the children. Johnny Depp's Wonka moves from side to side in beat with the music, almost as if trying to encourage the audience into thinking these songs are actually good, but all he does succeed in doing is convincing us that the creators are arrogant in their own product. The songs are dreadful, these new Oompa Loompas are dreadful, and all too often, the film itself is dreadful.<br/><br/>Almost as if to soften the blow, let's scrape the barrel and attempt to come up with some positives from this adaptation. Well for starters there is the already mentioned business card moment. There's also the brilliant '2001: A Space Odyssey' tribute in which the black rectangle is replaced with a Wonka bar. There's also the typical Burton black setting and layout. This final point in itself demonstrates the exact problem with this film. Beautifully shot and feeling at times like a 90 minute long chocolate advert, the film does look good. Like so many films nowadays however, once you strip away Burton's beautiful superficial layer, there is nothing underneath. We have an incredibly shallow and pointless film, and surely Roald Dahl deserves more.<br/><br/>One of the greatest children's writers of all time, Roald Dahl was a legend. With films about his books being made all the time, the idea of a Tim Burton style version surely appealed. It's a shame therefore that whilst Burton's work IS beautiful to watch, the screenplay of John August is awful. Overplaying multiple different angles and attempting to give Wonka a feeble history, August's work is severely lacking. Not for the first time, a Hollywood remake is a vastly inferior alternative compared with an original. Stick to Gene Wilder's 1971 version and feel sorry for everyone involved with this farce."
"cwfultz","10","3","6","9 August 2005"," The Best Remake To Grace The Silver Screen
","Charlie and the Chocolate is, as everyone already knows, the remake of the legendary Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory. Everyone had their reservations about it because it's a remakes, and remakes are typically not as good as originals. This one, however, pleased me greatly. It stayed truer to the book which made me happy because the book is an all-time favorite of mine.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp did an excellent performance and showed how diverse of actor he can be with his performance of Willy Wonka. He was so funny. The children were well-casted and at times, they were freaky. The oompa loompas were absolutely terrifying. Their songs were cool, though. I'm really thinking about buying the soundtrack if those songs are on there.<br/><br/>For curious parents, this is an excellent movie to take your children to. It's also perfect for fans of the book and fans of the original. I'm really hoping for a sequel, whether or not it's based on the second book: ""Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator""."

They even included Prince Pondicherry's Chocolate Palace, and the children coming out of the factory at the end - which was a nice surprise! I also liked the fact that all the Oompa Loompa's songs contained the original lyrics from the book, and that Deep Roy played them all! The flash backs were also a very clever idea: a good way to show what was written in the book! They counted out all of the pointless and made-up things that were in the first film: Charlie and Grampa Joe burping, making them fly and that weird man who is Wonka's assistant that makes the children collect the everlasting gob-stoppers! Overall, a FANTASTIC film, I say: GO AND SEE IT!"
"wrathchild712","9","3","6","7 August 2005"," What a surprise!!!
","Last night, for the second time this summer, I walked into a movie that I was extremely worried about. With Batman Begins and now Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, I had a really deep fear that the films would be terrible, yet that the hype was so good that I'd end up saying I liked them. With both movies, I did end up liking them, but because they were genuinely GREAT movies.<br/><br/>With Charlie, there were so many questions. Will it be better than the original? Will it stick to the story since it is, in fact, named after the Roald Dahl book, unlike the original movie? Will Johnny Depp make us all forget about Gene Wilder? As soon as it started, I knew it would be great. Danny Elfman did the soundtrack, and brilliantly so. Whatever the scene called for, be it the orchestral arrangements in the opening few minutes, or the clever new Oompa- Loompa songs, everything fit musically.<br/><br/>All of the members of the Bucket family were enjoyable and well played. Freddie Highmore was perfectly cast as Charlie and had that charisma that made it impossible to root against him. David Kelly was great as Grandpa Joe, and I really enjoyed Grandma Georgina's oddball irrelevance. Noah Taylor and Helena Bonham Carter were well cast as Mr. and Mrs. Bucket. On that note I would like to say I was glad there was actually a Mr. Bucket in this movie. In the original they played with the story a bit and said he had died. They even had his toothpaste- cap-screwer job exactly as it was in the book in this movie. Well done, guys!<br/><br/>The other children gave me mixed reactions. Augustus Gloop was not a hard act to fill. Just a fat boy who eats and eats...and eats. Nevertheless, he was entertaining. I liked the little girl that played Veruca, though I think in retrospect the girl who played her in the original was better. Anna Sophia Robb, as Violet, was my favorite of the brat kids. I did NOT like Mike Teavee at all. For the way the script was written, I guess the kid played the role well. But the problem was with the script. Mike was WAY too intense. (Though I did quite like how Johnny Depp constantly made fun of his 'mumbling')<br/><br/>Ah yes, Johnny Depp and Deep Roy...aka Willy Wonka and the Oompa Loompas. At first I thought Depp was forcing his role a little, but I grew to like how he was so much quirkier than Gene Wilder had been in the original. For me, part of Willy was how he acted when placed around other people, when he'd alienated himself completely from the outside world. There would be a bit of weirdness in this situation, and Depp pulled it off nicely. Deep Roy was good as the Oompa Loompas. I loved their new songs, but the costumes weren't doing it for me. Plain old orange and white like in the original would have been better if you ask me. <br/><br/>The movie LOOKED spectacular too. That's one of my favorite Tim Burton trademarks - his ability to create totally magical worlds. From the dark, odd environments of Nightmare Before Christmas to Big Fish and now Charlie, scenery is where his true talent lies. The Chocolate Room exemplifies this perfectly. When that door opens and the kids walk in, how can you not think to yourself 'Tim, you da man!'? <br/><br/>They stayed true to the story, Johnny Depp was outstanding, and this movie was way better than the original. What more do you need?"
"TalosIV","Null","3","6","6 August 2005"," A total misfire
","Perhaps I'm just too stuck in the past. I've never read the book, but I love the original film. Wilder just cannot be replaced. His Wonka was NOT weird, he was just putting on an act to push the kids and parents to their respective breaking points. And it worked.<br/><br/>In the original film, the ultimate prize was a secret until the end. In this one, we know some kid is getting something pretty special.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp's Wonka is just a freak. He would have little to no chance of becoming ANYTHING in life. I happen to love Depp, but this performance was bad and tough to watch. One or two amusing lines and nothing else.<br/><br/>The ending of the original film is much better. A better morality tale, if you will. Handing the everlasting gob-stopper back to Wonka, was perfect.<br/><br/>So this one is closer to the book? Hmm...guess I'll have to skip the book then. Of course, Dahl wrote the screenplay to the original film, so what to think? Hmm again.<br/><br/>Sorry, the original is a twisted bit of confectionery magic. This one is missing an ingredient or two."
"lancevortex","9","3","6","4 August 2005"," At last a decent version of the classic book
","It's notable that the bulk of negative comments about this film are from people who haven't read the book. If they had, they would realise why Dahl hated the original movie, as it not only deviated from the plot, which I can forgive, but deviated from the spirit of the book, which I can't. Dahl was the master of modern-day children's literature; he knew that as well as comedy and happy endings, children love the sinister and the surreal. The original film kept the surreal (alas that 70s clichÃ© kind of surrealism) but discarded the sinister, replacing it with twee Hollywood glitz and sentimentality. Gene Wilder is a great comic actor, but his Wonka was all wrong: for the most part far too friendly, and then far too nasty when the movie pointlessly had Charlie breaking the rules. Basically, the original film is execrable.<br/><br/>Burton's version is infinitely better, and surely Roald Dahl would have loved it. It sticks to the book's plot, dialogue and characterisation almost religiously, and Burton's style is a perfect match for Dahl's. Johnny Depp is great; I never used to have much time for him but he grows on me with each of his films that I see. His Willy Wonka is less self-assured than that of the book, but it works very well, and the addition of his childhood flashbacks, though superfluous, is actually quite well done and adds a bit more depth to the character. As for the Michael Jackson thing, well, my friends and I noted that too, but really only because of the pale face and squeaky voice: Wonka may be weird, but not THAT weird.<br/><br/>The use of British character actors to play Charlie's family is great too, but I'll admit that as I'm British I always saw the family as British when I read the book, so having an all-American cast wouldn't have been right for me. Unlike many, I thought that the Oompa-Loompas were brilliant and the songs were hilarious, my only gripe being that Dahl's lyrics couldn't be heard properly above the music. The sets were magical too. In fact the only thing that grated with me was the British actors using Americanisms such as ""candy"" and ""pants"", but that's obviously completely forgivable given where the bulk of the potential audience lives, and if I remember correctly, the book used Americanisms too.<br/><br/>To sum up, I've been looking forward to a respectable film version of the book for over 25 years, and finally it's arrived. Surely they will have to do the sequel ""Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator"", and I for one can't wait."
"ReviewsAtHome","10","3","6","24 July 2005"," Best adaptation of a children's book to movie!
","Anyone who doesn't like this movie, and claims the original is true to form obviously never read the books. While the original movie was a fine production, ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" was a great improvement. The first such improvement lay in the title: ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" -- NOT ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"". This movie is about Charlie first and foremost, not about a comedian from SNL. The rest lay in the scripting of the book to movie format. While all translations will undergo some changes (Lord of the Rings), this movie kept true to not only the attitude of each character (Violet and Mike make perfect sense), but presence of the gadgets (opening scene), the Oompa Loompa description (Deep Roy was amazing as opposed to candy colored midgets of the first movie), the songs (all written by Roald Dahl), down to Willy Wonka's view of the degradation of society. Roald Dahl's second wife has a producing credit on the film, forming a close tie between the family and this production (which, according to her in a recent newsweek interview, was lacking in the first film). I believe this made all the difference. The only major change in this book dealt with Willy Wonka, however, considering the character description in the book compared with last years ""Series of Unfortunate Events"", it would likely frighten any kid if Willy Wonka were put in makeup to resemble the book description. Having said that, Johnny Depp is Willy Wonka, as opposed to Gene Wilder being Gene Wilder. Charlie is always an innocent, without a single mean streak, rather than the first movie. The rest of the kids you absolutely hate -- like you should. I have seen it twice and wish to see it again."
"rebeccawray","9","3","6","23 July 2005"," A must for all true Ronald Dahl fans!
","I went to see this movie with my husband and our children, along with some of their friends. Commenting on the fact that it was directed by Tim Burton, my husband had already stated that he was not going to like this movie, but was going for the sake of the kids. Unlike myself, he found nothing of entertainment value in ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" and ""Edward Scissorhands"". We were pleasantly surprised. The movie is very true to the book and, having read the book MANY times, it was refreshing to see a director finally get it right. The songs by the Oompa Loompas were all taken from lyrics written by Ronald Dahl himself in the book, but set to tunes and dancing that provided amusement beyond what you would expect. Burton and Depp do an excellent job of portraying Wonka as what Dahl intended, a crazy chocolatier who faces his mortality and realizes that he must open his world to children, whom he obviously does not like, in order to ensure his legacy. Depp really deserves an Oscar nomination here . . . the nuances of his craziness are perfect. Freddy Hightower, who has already proved his acting chops in ""Finding Neverland"" seals his fate as the young actor to watch.<br/><br/>While this movie is highly recommended, I have two tiny, and I mean tiny, complaints. The first is what I consider to be the unnecessary addition of a back story to Wonka to explain the method or reason behind the madness. This wasn't contained in the book and, to me, felt either contrived because there must be some reason Wonka is the way is (can't he just be what he is without explanation) or, I suspect, to add a moral lesson to the movie, i.e. the importance of family. Not every movie has to teach a lesson, and that is why it is called entertainment, and I felt the back story to be unnecessary other than to give us yet another good performance by Christopher Lee, portraying Wonka's dad. The other complaint I have is the portrayal of Charlie's mom by Helen Bonham Carter. While I have no real complaint about her performance, i.e. its not bad, I didn't feel that she really added anything to the movie, which may not be her fault given that Mrs. Bucket is, at best, a very minor character in the film. However, having seen Ms. Bonham Carter's acting abilities at their best (check out ""Lady Jane"", ""The Wings of the Dove"" and ""Howards' End""), it would sadden me to know that she has resigned herself, as she has most recently, to mainly appearing in her boyfriend's films.<br/><br/>Overall, I found this movie very entertaining and can't wait to see it again on DVD. Will there be a follow-up ""Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator"" Mr. Burton?"
"SeminolePhenom","9","3","6","23 July 2005"," Different movie from Original, Don't't expect Gene Wilder movie!
","The idea of the story is still the same. Charlie (Freddie Highmore) is a poor boy, who lives with mother (Helena Bonham Carter), father (Noah Taylor), Grandfather (David Kelly), and 3 others grandparents in a very small shack. They live in a town where Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory is the most major mystery. Willy Wonka (Johnny Depp) puts a golden ticket in five of his ""Wonka Bars"" and sends word that whoever finds a golden ticket gets a tour through his massive factory.<br/><br/>In contrast to the version of 1971, Willy Wonka already lets the people know that the winner of the kids gets the grand prize(whereas in the 1971 version, it was said that it was a life supply of Wonka Chocolate for all of the kids). The kids are now symbolized much more as some of the 7 deadly sins in this version and the parents genders changed in two places. The scary boat scene has been changed and Charlie is also portrayed as much more innocent because Burton did away with the soda pop scene. The songs are totally different and the ending was much more different.<br/><br/>These changes should have been easily predicted when the job was given to Tim Burton(who does everything his own way). I can't compare which movie was better due to the fact that the movies are so different. They are both good in their own ways. Don't expect the original from 1971, expect a totally new movie and you will enjoy it. Tim Burton did an amazing job and this movie will go right there with the classics (Edward Scissorhands,Batman, Sleepy Hollow) Johnny Depp was a much different Willy Wonka (more humanized) but only he and Burton could pull it off. Depp and Burton did it again! Freddie Highmore's acting was also as fantastic as it was in Finding Neverland.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this movie."
"LupinsGal2004","9","3","6","23 July 2005"," Fun family movie.
","I'm not one for remakes, because lately remakes are just raunchy vulgar redos of what use to be good family shows (IE Dukes of Hazzard.) But I have to say Tim Burton was genius when it comes to Charley and the Chocolate factory.<br/><br/>not a huge fan of the original (It was before my time, so as a kid I didn't appreciate ""older"" films), so I wasn't looking forward to seeing this, but the twist in the story, the brilliant way Johnny Depp played Willy Wonka, the children in the movie, the visual... it all wrapped together in a perfect movie.<br/><br/>Depp was wonderful in the role. I don't know who else could have played Wonka the way he did. There were a few minor scenes that were disturbing... the squirrels beating the rich girl up as she left nail marks in the ground where they dragged her away, and the melting singing puppets were a bit disturbing. lol.<br/><br/>but other than that, the movie would definitely be a good family movie... for kids older than 6 because of the squirrel thing. I'm 28 and that freaked me out a bit. lol.<br/><br/>Great movie though. Best this year so far! I can't wait for the next Tim Burton/Johnny Depp collaboration- ""The corpse bride."" There is magic when those two get together."
"Carriejade","4","3","6","23 July 2005"," OK at best.
","I really didn't enjoy this film. I am the kind of person who believes that if something was done well the first time, leave it alone. I was not all that impressed by Johnny Depp's performance, but then again, I don't think he is really all that great of an actor. He likes to hide behind very wacky characters and then say hes ""acting"". Its a choice, but...it's very obvious. Anyway, I thought he was annoying and couldn't really pick one path or another to take with the character. Was he a child? A genius? Was he just there to annoy us and make us not like him? I decided on that in the end. I actually found the film rather boring and although its obvious that Deep Roy is an extremely talented actor (kudos to him), all the Ompa Looma songs were, I'm sorry, but painful to watch. I actually thought some of the best performances actually came from the children (specifically Veruca and Charlie), and maybe Helena Bonham Carter (who was only in it for a few minutes). All in all, I wasn't impressed. If I had to do it again I would wait for the DVD."
"pschwebe","3","3","6","22 July 2005"," Heavy chocolate.
","A lot of press has been made of this version ""Charlie And The Chocolate Factory"" being more faithful to Roald Dahl's story than the 1971 ""Willy Wonka And The Chocolate Factory"". After having seen both, and having read the novel to my kids for years, I have to say that this movie has given me a greater appreciation for Gene Wilder's nuanced performance in the earlier movie, as well as director Mel Stuart's shrewd choices.<br/><br/>It's true, the new picture's director, Tim Burton, had the budget to make a more accurate film. It is more accurate in it's details. And it's clear that Burton has a real affection for the story. But, the details do not make for a whole that has the impact of either the book or the earlier movie. <br/><br/>The reasons involve Mr. Burtons bewildering deviations from this ""more faithful"" rendering. For one, Mr. Burton feels compelled to add back-story explaining why Willy Wonka is the way he is, and so he and/or the scriptwriter, John August, have added a pointless subplot involving Wonka's father. <br/><br/>Secondly, his take, or maybe Johnny Depp's take, on the character of Willy Wonka is just plain bad. Willy Wonka, as originally written by Dahl was a spritely little man, an eccentric driven by humor, and a love of chocolate and children. He was light. He had to be light to balance out the mean-spirited nastiness of the children. Not this Willy Wonka. This guy is heavy. He doesn't care about the kids, and he doesn't seem to care about chocolate as much as be obsessed by it. His eccentricity is driven by a self-absorbed humorless desire to escape his dysfunctional relationship with his father. (Like Spielberg in ""Hook"", Burton has bent a classic story to deal with his ""Father"" issues. Is this a Hollywood thing?)<br/><br/>Even the Oompa Loompas are heavy. In the book, they are characterized by their humor, by their joy. They laugh a lot, and their songs come from their joy. Well, there's no joy here. These guys are serious. Serious when they work, serious when they dance, serious when they sing. Serious when they psychoanalyze Mr. Wonka.<br/><br/>Yes, the details here are more loyal, more faithful to the original story. But if you want to see a Willy Wonka more as Roald Dahl intended, and a story whose details may be less perfect, but whose broad strokes are, unlike this movie, right on target, go down to you local video store and rent the 1971 film."
"smorty2002","8","3","6","22 July 2005"," A great movie
","Charlie and the Chocolate factory is a great movie based on the original with a few twists of its own. Johnny Depp renames Willy Wonka as he wanders through the Chocolate factory. He adds some spunk and Charm as he plays an over eccentric, out of touch, chocolate fanatic. Freddie Highmore also does terrific as he plays the poor young British boy with dreams of golden tickets in his head. Another new twist Tim Burton throws at the movie are the Oompa Loompas, the come out in all kinds of attire and sing songs that will have the whole theater laughing hysterically. All together i highly recommend Charlie and the Chocolate Factory to movie goers of all ages."
"lkdg32","4","3","6","21 July 2005"," VERY underwhelming
","I hated this movie and the only thing I liked about it was that Depp and the fat kid were funny. The fat kid was over the top and did the most with his character except going more over the top eating all the candy when they were at the main candy area before he fell in the river. The actress who played Veruca Salt was awful (unlike in the first movie), the parents were very uninteresting for the most part unlike the somewhat memorable parents from the first movie. Violet was more entertaining when her gimmick was just being a obsessed gum chewer (in the first movie). The fat kid's mom was fine for just looking the part and Violet's mom personality was good but she didn't do a very good job in the movie. Grandpa Joe's and Charlie's relationship just wasn't there, except somewhat in the start of the movie (the 71 version did a better job with their relationship).<br/><br/>Charlie was more noticeable in the 71 version than in this version where Charlie looks the part, and only memorable thing was the predictable ""I won't leave my family"" statement at the end. The old version seemed to put much more emphasis on Charlie and Wonka. We see more of Charlie in a shorter film it seems. For instance the fizzy lifting drink scene. Wonka was very memorable in the first movie and sang a great song (Pure Imagination). In the newer version he brings nothing to the table except being funny to watch (like him getting really happy and moving along to the Oompa Loompa songs).<br/><br/>There are much better quotes in the old version, and a better ending. In fact they built up his home AND his school for instance so when you see Charlie pointing down and mentioning his home and school in the elevator, it means something because we experienced both of them in the movie. The old version had an excellent song by the owner of the candy store, whereas in the new version the songs are entertaining to listen to but none of them are very memorable except maybe for Augustus's one. It was funny though at first when Mike Teevee mentioned that after the Augustus song was finished he thought that what just happened was fixed.<br/><br/>The old version had the entertaining teacher of Charlie. The newer version had the somewhat funny grandma. There have been much more characters like the out of touch grandma in movies than of Charlie's teacher in the old version, so I prefer Charlie's teacher. The old version had a more straight forward story and it moved better. The story about Wonka's father in the new version wasn't very entertaining. The old version had the memorable menacing character of Slugworth, the new version does not. The candy area where the chocolate river is in the candy factory in the old version looked much better, and bigger than in the newer version.<br/><br/>The Oompa Loompa songs were much more interesting and subtle in the first version than in this one, like they were expecting the bad things to happen to the bad children and giving their thoughts on children in general (the Oompa Loompas in the old movie that is). In the new version most of the parents were horrible like Veruca's dad who just stood there when Veruca was about to fall in the hole. Mike Teeve's dad was incredibly boring, unlike his mom in the old version where she didn't have any interesting personality, but at least she interacted in the movie. In the old version the dad and Veruca interacted much more and much better. Gene Wilder was so much better as Wonka and much more interesting than Depp. I watched the new version and I thought of Wonka as a crazy moron and never did I care to know about his backhistory.<br/><br/>The time in and before the factory seemed much longer in this version. For instance in the new version they took more than 5 seconds or so (unlike in the old version) to explain the story of the guy with the fake golden ticket. There was also the computer that tries to know where the golden tickets are storyline that was amusing. In the new version the time in the factory seemed quick and the experience was underwhelming. The old version it seems a fairly long while they are in the factory. There wasn't any interesting interaction in the inventing room unlike in the prior version. In the new version they skip the everlasting gopstopper (or whatever its call) part for the most part and go right away to the 5 course meal gum part. There was also the great ""I've got a golden ticket"" song in the first movie.<br/><br/>The Oompa Loompas weren't very memorable in this movie, they stood out much more in the old version with their hair and makeup. I think if the new version is more like the book than the old version, than the old version of the movie is better than the book. I definitely felt better for Charlie, Grandpa Joe, and their family when Wonka told Charlie he won the factory and can take his family than in the newer version when I didn't care at all. I watched the old version of the movie as a kid in awe the first time I saw it, when I saw the new version all I can say is I was somewhat amused, bored, and underwhelmed."
"BlazingSpecter","4","3","6","21 July 2005"," Sorry, Hollywood once again ruins a classic
","Hollywood apparently having run out of fresh ideas and in the midst of having to remake any film they can finally took on the child classic Willie Wonka and the Chocolate Factory.<br/><br/>I know, its ""Just like the book"" except for the double entendre to spice up the film and make it acceptable to the ""Blue state"" folks.<br/><br/>Jonny Depp gives off a strange vibe that should warn any parent not to let their small kids alone with him. The Ompa-loompas were mean spirited and crude (based on being a kid when the original came out).<br/><br/>Of course there is always a little political jabs as you can guess that the good kids espouse ""Blue state values"" and the bad kids obviously live in Red states and their Dad's must have voted for .....<br/><br/>Why can't Hollywood just make a movie that do not have scenes where my kids has to ask me what xxxxxxx means? Or where I shake my head at some out of place anti-war message? I guess its because we could vote with our feet and not spend any money on the crap being produced today, but what else are we going to take the kids to see? Hollywood wins again.<br/><br/>I know, I will be bashed, saying that I grew up with the original and cannot accept the new version. My thought on this is how ironic it will be for the teeners and twenty-something's, when one day in the future, when yet another Wonka remake takes that stage, you will be the nostalgic ones that cannot accept ""Progress"" 4 out of 10"

Especially, Wonka - who seemed more dazed and confused than mysterious and strange.<br/><br/>Roald Dahl may hard to capture but the original is nearly perfect and this one aspires to little more than colorful weirdness. <br/><br/>Burton and Depp?

"neon47","8","3","6","21 July 2005"," Charlie and the Chocolate Factory... Tim Burton Style!
","Let's be honest here... this movie is warped. But that's not a bad thing at all, in fact it seems to add more life to it that way. I just saw this two days ago in the local theater and I have to say it was worth the overpriced tickets. I heard a lot of people say the original is better, but I've heard that this is closer to the book than the one with Gene Wilder. I haven't read the book so I'm not going to argue that statement. In many respects I did like this version better, but they did leave out some classic scenes. I don't want to spoil that for you however. Let's get down to business. Depp puts on a stellar performance like always, I couldn't have asked for more. The boy who plays Charlie also did a good job. So acting is right on the buttons. The Oompaloompas are only played by one man. Literally, that's all, just one guy plays every Oompaloompa. I guess that's one way to save cash. The story is the same as the old one; if you don't know the story or have never seen the original Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory then I'm just going to assume that you are technologically deprived. The thing about this version is that it has a deeper story with Willy Wonka than the original. This adds a little more depth to the movie. The set design is beautiful and like always, a bit eerie; just the way it should be done. I do like this version better than the original, not by much but it's with out doubt a worthy remake."
"malibu-7","10","3","6","20 July 2005"," Johnny Depp and Tim Burton deliver again!!
","After seeing this movie I am convinced that Johnny Depp is without a doubt the greatest actor of our time. Also Tim Burton proves once again that he is one of the best directors of our time. When I heard that they were doing a remake, I was very skeptical. I am a huge fan of the original and thought they would totally screw this up. But when I heard that Tim Burton and Johnny Depp were involved my interest was immediately peaked. I never thought that anyone could play a better Willie Wonka than Gene Wilder, but Depp nailed it in his own unique way. I absolutely loved this movie. It may very well be better than the original."
"Stormsabre","8","3","6","20 July 2005"," Interesting spin from the original
","Might as well throw this out there right off the bat.<br/><br/>**WARNING: SPOILERS AHEAD** <br/><br/>You all know what this movie is about. No sense in repeating it for the umpteenth time. <br/><br/>But what I think is interesting about this remake is the way people are reacting to two of the more visible deviations from the 1971 film: Depp's performance as Wonka and the slightly revised ending.<br/><br/>I'll admit that I thought that Depp's version of Willy was far more strange then Gene Wilder's version, but the more I thought about it, the more it made sense. This guy chose to lock himself away in his factory for twenty YEARS, with no one else to talk to but the Oompa Loompas--and as far as their conversational ability goes, they're a bit off-kilter, themselves. If you were put into such a scenario, don't you think that you'd act more than a little wonky (pun intended) when you finally come face to face with the public? <br/><br/>And before any of you say no, how much time you spend on the internet each day? How long do you talk on the phone as opposed to speaking with other folks face-to-face? How much TV do you watch? Our digital world encourages us to play ""hermit"" most of the time, too--it's just more deviously subtle about it.<br/><br/>Once I got into that mindset, I loved the way Johnny Depp played the character. A sort of sick cross between a non-sugar-amped Jim Carrey and Michael Jackson (yeah, I have to agree with a lot of folks on that one, creepy as it is), he barely restrains his delight when the bad kids get what's coming to them, and I was right there along with him. Sure seems pretty rare nowadays to see parents actually disciplining their own kids when the situation calls for such, doesn't it? <br/><br/>Regarding the ending....there are two pivotal events: Charlie's response to Willy's offer, and what happens regarding Charlie's father's job. These two plot points underscore what I feel were two strong themes that Burton and company were trying to push home: namely, it should all be about the family, and that if you want your life to change for the better, you have to make the effort for it yourself somehow. Sure, we all want to do it the easy way. We all want to get that ""Golden Ticket"" (win the lotto, maybe?) and have everything handed to us without working for it...but 9 times out of 10, it just doesn't work that way.<br/><br/>All that being said, most of the rest of the film is fairly faithful to the book and the original movie. Given that Deep Roy plays ALL the Oompa Loompas, the special effects and CGI do an impressive job of making each of his physical representations stand out and look different from one another during the dance numbers. Props should also be given to Freddie Highmore, whose portrayal of Charlie is kindhearted and likable without being nauseatingly sweet. Also, the side story element of Willy's relationship with his father was an interesting touch, and also explains to a large extent why he behaves the way he does (and was it ever wonderful to see a true veteran of old school horror gracing the big screen once more in something this modern!).<br/><br/>If you're a parent that is worried as to whether or not the images in this movie will frighten your children, well...it's a Tim Burton film, so you should expect some weirdness. But chances are, if they can sit through the swill that is most of today's cartoons and video games, they'll get through this just fine.<br/><br/>If you like Tim Burton's previous work, then this one's a no-brainer. A nice teaser while we wait for ""Corpse Bride"", this fall.<br/><br/>Anyone else who's on the fence...if you liked the original, you'll probably be satisfied with this. See it with an open mind and don't compare it religiously to the first movie, and you'll have a sticky, tricky, chocolatey good time."
"blacklab64","9","3","6","19 July 2005"," Just as Sweet the Second Time Around
","Seeing the earlier version as a child and recently rereading the book, I was very interested in also seeing Tim Burton's version of Charlie and the Chocolate factory. Although I did enjoy the earlier version with Gene Wilder and appreciate the film's creative ingenuity for its time, I really enjoyed Burton's take on the same story.<br/><br/>For the most part, I felt Burton did an excellent job with casting and creating the characters to be authentic, as in the book. Characters such as Charlie, Grandpa Joe, Veruca Salt, and Augustus Gloop seem to come alive in the film directly off the pages from Roald Dahl's book. The film seems modernized with Violet's character and her ultra-competitive mother, which provides some additional social commentary to the parents' roles, not just the spoiled and ill-mannered children.<br/><br/>The special effects, as expected, were impressive. It's interesting in watching the earlier version where there weren't as many special effects used (or available at that time, for that matter)and noticing that it did not affect the film's overall quality. After seeing Burton's version, though, it is an eye-opening experience as to the advances that have come along in film-making. It's almost as though you didn't know that you were missing these in the older version.<br/><br/>Overall, I felt that Burton's version was much closer to the book than the original (which is very interesting, considering that the author, Roald Dahl wrote the screenplay for the first version!). While many people were upset that a classic was remade, I felt it was justified given the difference in technology available for film-making in regards to special effects, and the fact that the storyline is actually more authentic in the second version. Charlie and the Chocolate Factory also has Tim Burton's creative influence, which can be sometimes outside the box, but for the most part was laugh-out-loud funny and very entertaining."
"taxcpamst","9","3","6","19 July 2005"," Wow....I really liked this!!
","I saw this on Saturday. It's funny. I had a mix of feelings while watching this...<br/><br/>During the first part of the movie, where the golden tickets are being found and the characters are being developed, I was thinking ""This is SO good. I have to buy this on DVD when it comes out."" I loved the character development of all of the kids.<br/><br/>It has so many fun similarities with the original, but definitely some original stuff thrown it that is MUCH closer to the book (which I'm reading to my kids currently).<br/><br/>Anyway, the feeling changed when Willie Wonka enters the picture. Johnny Depp plays him incredibly well. Gene Wilder didn't play the person from the book. He played someone that is eccentric but really just ""a little weird"". Johnny Depp plays the character the way he was meant to be played. A major psycho with some definite issues.<br/><br/>The scene where you finally meet Willie is very odd. I won't spoil it for you, but you end up thinking ""That was really, really weird"". It sets the tone for the whole character...and you can't escape the fact that this guy is a total loon.<br/><br/>The story progresses fairly similarly to the Gene Wilder version and the similarities are very enjoyable...but so are the departures. You get a lot more background on Willie than the first movie and why he is the way he is. Another departure is Veruca's demise. In the first movie, she wants a goose that lays the golden chocolate egg. That's where she has her tantrum and loses it. In this version, there are no geese. Instead, as true to the book, there is a nut room with squirrels. The computer effects in this sequence are simply amazing as there is no way they could train squirrels to do what they do...and it looks totally real.<br/><br/>Another departure from the movie is the ending. Much better in my opinion.<br/><br/>In all, I will buy the DVD. I loved the movie and can't wait to see it again, but Willie Wonka is a really weird duck!"
"BHorrorWriter","9","3","6","19 July 2005"," Burton+Depp+Wonka=Good Times
","When I first heard a New Willy Wonka film was in the making, I must say I did hold a sliver of skepticism. How could it (the new film) compare to the original 1971 version? And then I began my research. Getting updates from internet sites. Reading my entertainment magazines, etc. I still had doubts! But what convinced me to change my mind? When I heard Tim Burton would be directing, I devoted my faith to him that his retelling of Willy Wonke would be great! And I must say it was! Early on, Burton said he was no ""remaking"" the 1971 version, to which is not a fan, but simply staying true to the book (which I have yet to read).<br/><br/>To simply compare the two films and say one is better than the other would be unfair. What I liked about one - I didn't not like about the other. Example: The 1971 version was full of beautifully extravagant set pieces, which one could tell took hours/day/weeks to create. Whereas the 2005 version was cluttered and diluted with too much CGI. Another example...Gene Wilder was very clever and quirky as Willy Wonka. Johnny Depp was brilliant, frightening, clever, quirky, funny, energetic, charismatic, charming...the list goes on! Furthermore, I must also admit, with th exception of the young man who played Charlie Bucket, the children in this film were much more dull, albeit meaner than in the 1971 Version. No to say this is a bad thing...I did much prefer the performances by the children in the 1971 version as opposed to the 2005 version.<br/><br/>And of course the story. Again, I have yet to read the book - however, I feel the telling Tim Burton gave the film was much more than a simple fairy tale of a possibly insane candy-man.<br/><br/>The 1971 Version was cluttered with obstacles, which prevented it from telling a truly ingenious story. Obstacles, such as the over-the-top Broadway musical numbers, did not move the story along. I was very happy to see Burton avoided such obstacles.<br/><br/>The overall moral of the story has not changed. However, in this telling, Charlie does more than simply gets the factory because he is a good boy. He also helps Willy Wonka rediscover the meaning of family.<br/><br/>On a scale from 1-10, I give this film a solid 9. I took away a point because of all the CGI.<br/><br/>Burton and Depp once again prove they are a force to be reckoned with. Charlie and the Chocolate Factory allows, no demands that you suspend your mind of anything but your imagination."

I admit, it's not the morbid Burton I and many others have come to love, but its done on such an awesome level that most will not care, as they fall into Wonka's world of unforgettable fun. <br/><br/>The characters are magnificent, all playing their roles as best anyone could've. Still, credit must be given to the amazing Johnny Depp, who is the obvious backbone to the entire movie. Freddy Highmore also does a superb job as Charlie Bucket, but true fans of his previous work will notice his acting does not differ from role to role. Most other people will enjoy how Burton goes more with the book, and less with the old movie. The squirrels and one person playing all the Oompa's added to my enjoyment and kept me occupied in my seat through the movie's entirety. A MUST SEE!!!"

I hope u all that haven't seen it yet will like it and that u will go see it cause i recommend this film to everyone trust me it is funny!!!!"
"amlee1978","8","3","6","18 July 2005"," Very funny and cute!
","I am a big fan of the original film and I am not partial to remakes. I went to see this and loved it. Johnny Depp was hilarious and it was just a really good movie. The ending was a little lame, kinda dragged out. But all in all it was a very good movie! There were some similarities to the original movie, but lots of differences too. Not as much song and dance as the original. Some people were worried about whether or not this movie would be o.k. for kids. My kids saw it and they are 8 and 4 1/2 and they weren't scared or anything. They both loved it. I would say this is a good movie to go to on a date too. It's a nice movie you can cuddle up to and watch, have a good laugh. Johnny Depp was kind of creepy looking as Willy Wonka, but he was very funny! I highly recommend this movie!"
"SpinaSuperDog","9","3","6","18 July 2005"," Very faithful to the book.
","I was always disappointed at the original Gene Wilder version of this movie - too childlike and junky, sugary sweet. Even as a seven year old I used to get really angry that this was NOT how I had interpreted the book - the imagery was so out of synch with my imagination. The book that Roald Dahl wrote was both amusing but had a sinister dark side that was never shown fully in that '70s movie. This new version is how I saw it - even all those years ago - slightly dark, sinister with that tongue-in-cheek humour that really describes Dahl. <br/><br/>The script 95% mirrors the book text word-for-word in parts and all scenes and chocolate bars have the correct name and look oh-so-close to the illustrations that are depicted in the first edition of the book, right down the the Art-Deco looking chocolate factory.<br/><br/>I loved it and could not get enough. Depp is hilarious as the semi-twisted Wonka. The Oompah-Loompah songs are a great modern take and use the correct lyrics again sourced from the book. Burton really took the time to get into this authors psyche and capture using images the essence of the text. Very cool. Oh yeah, read the book if you're 8-80."
"cassie-finley","3","3","6","18 July 2005"," Not worth the time
","If you have seen and enjoy the ORIGINAL Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory this movie is not worth your time and money. Johnny Depp's portrayal of Willy Wonka is not that of the friendly Candy Man that Gene Wilder did in the original. The story line is the same basic plot with many important factors left out from the original movie. And if you enjoyed the songs in the original you will be disappointed even by the shotty oompa loompas in this version of the classical film. There is no pure imagination in this film just another Hollywood blunder. If your children have not seen the original Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory then they may be able to appreciate Tim Burton's adaptation of the book. While the movie is not completely a let down, I did enjoy seeing some of the new gadgets that were created for the film. Don't waste your money in the theater, just wait until it comes to DVD."
"miss_piglet38","3","3","6","18 July 2005"," Extremely Disappointing!!!!
","As soon as I heard Charlie and the Chocolate Factory was being remade with Johnny Depp as Wonka and directed by Tim Burton I knew this movie wasn't going to be an actual remake and I could not wait to see Burton's view of this film. <br/><br/>The excitement I felt for this movie was so overwhelming that my friends knew better then to say no to seeing it with me. Being a huge fan of the original, I used to skip school to go with my mom to the video store she worked at and watch it repeatedly, I was expecting something a little closer to the original just darker. What I got was a lot of boredom and a lot of dissatisfaction. Some of the better parts of the original were nowhere to be found in this one. When we first saw an Oompa-Loompa I thought hey they look good, until I realized all Ooompa Loompas were played by the same man, Deep Roy. <br/><br/>The scenery in the movie was quite nice, nothing great. The children's characters were well done and similar to the original so no disappointment there. The old people were lovable, you felt for Charlie's family and you also felt how much they wanted to give their little Charlie his dream of setting his foot into Mr. Wonka's Factory.<br/><br/>I gave this movie three stars because of Johnny Depps portrayal of Willy Wonka, he plays it in his usual dark Johnny way so he didn't disappoint at all. Two of the stars though go to Charlie, Freddie Highmore, he has got to be the cutest, most believable child actors I've seen in a long time.<br/><br/>Over all this movie sucked. I kept waiting for it to get better but I just got more bored and restless, I couldn't wait to see the credits. I would not recommend this movie to someone I hate and I'm going to be a little more hesitant about seeing anything remade by Tim Burton. Tim Burton this movie fell flat and I think you should give us all back our money for sitting through 2 hours of torture."
"independantyam","9","3","6","17 July 2005"," A beautifully faithful adaptation... mostly.
","I will admit first off that I am a HUGE fan of Tim Burton and Johnny Depp, but more importantly, Roald Dahl and his wonderful children's story. Thus, I lay in anxious anticipation for this film for over a year, and my biggest fear was that they would completely butcher the story, no matter how much faith I have in these cinematic geniuses.<br/><br/>HOWEVER, Burton and Depp and Dahl are obviously a trio of much creative power. Burton's penchant for fairy-tale stories with a quirky twist, Depp's eagerness to go out on a limb for unique characters, combined with Dahl's ingenious, age-old story make for one FANTASTIC movie.<br/><br/>The visuals in this movie, aside for some futuristic stuff like the television room, were on par with what the book intended, I thought, and inside the factory one is completely immersed in Wonka's wonderland. The only bad thing about the factory tour is that we didn't get to see enough of it - only enough for the story to make sense, although I really wish Burton had included some of the book's highlights such as ""Square Candies That Look Round."" Depp's acting was exactly the right kind of bizarre mystery that the role of Wonka required. Freddie Highmore, who plays Charlie, lived up to my hoped and is truly an amazing child actor. All of the children, parents, and other characters (most notably Deep Roy for his hilarious turn as the Oompa Loompas) were also highly amusing. The great story was accompanied by a fair bit of humour, humour that was insightful and often caught you off-guard.<br/><br/>The one major criticism I have of this movie is the addition of the Wonka back-story. To me, the fact that one didn't know about Wonka's past simply added to the mystery and excitement of the story. Although it fit in nicely with the film, I felt it took away from Charlie's story, which is after all the essence of the story.<br/><br/>Overall, though, this is a great movie. Mature kids will really enjoy it, and littler ones will like it for its great use of colour and joy.<br/><br/>Three thumbs up!"
"Nsync4ml","10","3","6","17 July 2005"," Really good.
","I think this movie was pure magic. I had seen the original, quite some time ago, and was expecting this to ruin it totally. However, with added technology and effects, it enhanced the original and was even better. Johnny Depp as Willy Wonka was an added bonus. I think he did really well in his role, and added to the movie. It was a family film but kept me laughing, even as a teenager. Not only was I kept laughing, but it kept my interest. The ending was timeless as well as this movie. Praise to all involved.<br/><br/>I really loved it.<br/><br/>What an awesome movie!"
"BertieRussell","9","3","6","17 July 2005"," A Must See For All Wonka Fans!
","I loved this movie! It is as great as the original but for different reasons. The sets and special effects were fantastic. Right from the beginning, the mood is set. The visuals are dark, dreamy, and textured. Johnny Depp is amazing as Wonka. He is quirky, funny, crazy, and mischievous. I was literally laughing out loud during most of the scenes.<br/><br/>Gone are the wise Wonka quotes and Oompa Loompa songs that turned the original into a cult classic. Never the less, this movie is still a masterpiece. The soundtrack is hauntingly beautiful Â– much like the music in Edward Scissorhands. Tim Burton is the perfect director for this new adaptation. He and Johnny Depp work their magic to make this a highly enjoyable movie to watch. It's Burton's best film since Edward Scissorhands. The acting is good. Freddy Highmore is sweet and charming as Charlie Bucket. But, Depp steals the show. I will definitely be buying the DVD when it becomes available.<br/><br/>Charlie And The Chocolate Factory is a must see movie for all Wonka fans."
"robert-607","6","3","6","17 July 2005"," My View Of The Movie
","My view of the movie is not all that bad, I did enjoy the movie more then I thought I might, Johnny Depp to me does it again bringing more of the original character from the book to life more then what Gene Wilder did, however this doesn't mean that Gene didn't do a great job, it just means that they are two different people with different ideas.<br/><br/>The movie did a great job keeping kids attention focused on the film, my five year old was seen dancing while the Oompa Loompa's took the stage and she never really noticed that it was the same actor. From the time that the movie starts to the end the five year old was pretty much into the movie.<br/><br/>The movie moved along rather quickly, and the story line was not at all dull, and at times very funny. Even though I give this movie a ""Six"" this is a movie that I will buy on DVD when it comes out, if not for me, it will be for the kids. Over all I thought the movie was good."
"AngelGrl1020","9","3","6","17 July 2005"," Some info not correct
","Just to clarify for those parents that will be bringing their child to see this movie....Johnny Depps character of Willie Wonka WAS NOT linked to Marilyn Manson at all!! This is a rumor that has been in many many magazines/web sites because people assumed he looked like the rock star. Knowing that Tim Burton does movies that portray ""interesting characters"" such as Nightmare before Christmas, Johnny does portray that kind of character.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp had admitted on his appearance on the Oprah Show last week that he wanted to do more movies that his own children can see. He made the Willie Wonka voice up while he was playing Barbies with his daughter and she liked that voice.<br/><br/>Just wanted to get the ""truth"" out there! Enjoy the movie!!!"
"greenifym3","8","3","6","16 July 2005"," Not Bad....Not Bad At All
","I know many people will be saying ""Oh how scandalous! Johnny looks like Michael Jackson and is just as creepy!"" Well, creepy is a harsh word. Let's try eccentric. Depp is good in his own right, but Freddie Highmore and the Bucket family steal the show.The new Oompa-Loompa songs are quite cool, and the nasty children who get eliminated are fun to watch because they are reminiscent of so many little brats who we love to see get their comeuppance.A new element added is the back story of how Wonka came to be is a nice twist that, although a little saddening, can be somewhat comical Be warned, some parts are indeed a little creepier than usual (ie Violet's blueberry transformation) and should be approached with caution. Otherwise, enjoy!"
"baseballgirl","7","3","6","16 July 2005"," A wonderful adventure
","Anytime Tim Burton and Johnny Depp get together, wonderful things happen and Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is not an exception.<br/><br/>From the beginning of the movie, you are pulled into this magnificent world that the sets and music create. There are so many colors and the visual grandeur is amazing. It all continues to develop throughout the film, too. The whole film offers such a treat to the eyes.<br/><br/>The storyline is very good, too, and does a great job of developing all the main characters. It really explains Wonka well, showing the background of what made him what he is. It also shows a lot of Charlie and why he is the way he is.<br/><br/>The acting is the highlight for me, however. Johnny Depp shows his creative genius again with Wonka. He makes a character that is mean, eccentric, loving, arrogant, and insecure at the same time. He is a mystery in a sense, but again another completely original Depp character. Freddie Highmore is wonderful yet again, and every other actor does their character superbly.<br/><br/>The best part of this movie? The fact that it is for all ages. I am an eighteen year old and loved it, there were a bunch of young children in the theater with me who loved it, and all of the parents and grandparents in there loved it. The whole theater erupted into laughs at all the right times, and you heard ""aw""s at all the right times.<br/><br/>Another Tim Burton Johnny Depp classic!"
"KristenM90","9","3","6","16 July 2005"," Deliciously New and Different
","I loved this movie. I just went to see it and it blew me away. I was somewhat skeptical, considering this was a remake and Johnny Depp looked kind of strange in the previews. He puts a completely different spin on the movie, and once again teams up with Tim Burton to create something sure to become beloved. Also, the screen chemistry between Freddy Highmore and Johnny Depp returns. Back in Finding Neverland they were perfectly in tune with each other and it returns again to add pleasing qualities to this movie. I always love Danny Elfman's music, but he just doesn't quite cut the mustard with this one. The movie does have some funny Oompa Loompa songs, but there are some songs that are just downright creepy. I loved this Tim Burton film, because once again he never ceases to amaze me. Don't hesitate to go to this one, you won't regret it."
"talair2000","8","3","6","16 July 2005"," Excellent adaptation of the book!
","Having never seen the 1971 movie Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory I could enjoy it for what it is, an excellent adaptation of R. Dahl's book (which I have read!). The movie is a visual feast for the eyes. There are also some sly nods to other films like Space 2001, Psycho and Burton's Ed Wood, Edward Scissorhands, etc. that made me grin. Like many of Burton's movies one needs to see it more than once to appreciate all the little details. It's twisted, askew and dark in some ways, (as the book is) yet delivers the message of what is and isn't truly important in life.<br/><br/>I also like that Elfman took Dahl's lyrics from the book and set them to music, I just wish it had been a little easier to make out what was being sung. Perhaps the problem was that the sound was too loud in the theater I saw it at.<br/><br/>I didn't see the Michael Jackson connection at all. In looks Willy reminded me far more of 60's pop stars than MJ. His voice also does recall those of children's' game show hosts from the 60's. Wonka is, to all intents and purposes, stuck in a time warp of his own making. Depp portrays Willy as a creative, brilliant inventor, who due to his upbringing and to living like a recluse for 15 years or so, is socially unskilled and awkward with adults and children alike. He doesn't like to touch or be touched and doesn't know how to relate to people or the world outside his factory. As usual Depp totally disappears in the role and becomes Mr. Wonka. Freddie Highmore again was excellent, and I've been a fan of David Kelly since the marvelous comedy ""Waking Ned Devine."" Deep Roy also was good. All in all CATCF is a very satisfying time at the movies. I rate it in the 8.5 to 9 range."
"jeanniologist","9","3","6","15 July 2005"," Wonderful adaptation of the book!
","Though I loved the 19070's Willy Wonka I equally enjoyed Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. I found it to be silly, sweet and a touch menacing (just like the 1970's adaptation). Depp's portrayal of Willy Wonka was original and quirky and the Oompa Loompa's were very funny. This movie is acceptable for kids to see in the same way the Gene Wilder's film was acceptable. It's wonderfully, gleefully, wickedly entertaining.<br/><br/>This film was NOT a remake of Willy Wonka but rather an adaptation of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. To compare it to the Gene Wilder film does both of the movies an injustice. Open your mind when you see Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and you will definitely enjoy it. Let the art and fun just flow over you."
"abulencia","10","3","6","15 July 2005"," Much Better!
","Much better than original film! It was much more faithful to the book, than the original movie. In my opinion Johnny Depp played a much better Willy Wonka than Gene Wilder. Gene didn't seem to have enough weirdness in him to play the part. I actually didn't like the original movie because it changed too much stuff around from the book.<br/><br/>The only reason this movie had so much negative reviews is because most people haven't even read the book, and they are mad because it's nothing like the original film. Don't listen to the reviews. If you don't like the movie, read the book and maybe you'll change your mind.<br/><br/>Congratulations Tim Burton for making an awesome movie! I think it was much better than the original!"
"luluk04","10","3","6","15 July 2005"," Burton, Depp deliver a Sweet Experience!
","Although my intentions of seeing this movie was purely to see the of the ingenious acting of Johnny Depp, I was surprised to enjoy not only Johnny, but the unbelievable job of child star Freddie Highmore and the world of Wonkaland created by director Tim Burton.<br/><br/>Growing up as a child, I loved the original film. You always hear, 'it's a classic' and can never be remade...Tim Burton has made it possible, and done it flawlessly. With a twist of odd humor and psychedelic color, Burton has put the original happy version together with his own instincts. He's added an eerie factor to the character of Wonka and his secret factory. The curiosity of the children and the oddness of Wonka's character is definitely more 'realistic' but of course, Burton has added his own spin on the setting, colors, and design. Although I did miss a few elements such as the musical of 'I've Got the Golden Ticket' and the unforgettable 'Oompa Loompa song', Burton has jazzed up the film into it's true potential. He much more closely follows Dahl's book, but uses the updated technology of today.<br/><br/>Overall, It's funny, to parents and children alike. Johnny Depp has transformed himself from a dashing, drunk Jack Sparrow, into an out-of-sorts, secluded,troubled, Willy Wonka. His resemblance, to anyone, is that of his former Burton character, Edward Scissorhands. Burton uses this remake to greatly expand on the life of Wonka, reaching into his past relationship with is own parents. Truly, at the end of this movie, you feel the story is complete.<br/><br/>It was definitely an enjoyable experience. Burton & Depp left the sold-out audience clapping as the credits rolled with a smile on their face. Hopefully, it will you too!"
"hockeygrrl12677","10","3","6","15 July 2005"," Another great Johnny Depp movie!
","The fact that they put so much emphasis and focus on family bonds really empresses me. I also enjoyed the focus that they placed on Willy Wonka's childhood/past. I had always wondered how he came to be. It added a whole new angle to the story! And Johnny Depp (and everyone) did an awesome job acting in this movie! I will definitely see it again! I didn't even mind all of the differences from the 70's version. It seems that Johnny Depp does well with Freddie Highmore and with Helena Bonham Carter. And when you see his name alongside Tim Burton's, you know it will be on the ""bizarre"" side while at the same time, interesting and intriguing."
"halfwaynowhere","10","3","6","15 July 2005"," brilliant!
","This film is absolutely brilliant! Johnny Depp is amazing as Willy Wonka, and Tim Burton captured every emotion in this film. I didn't find it one bit cheesy, and although the television commercials portrayed it as slightly creepy, this was not the case. You really get to know Willy Wonka, to get inside his head. There are no loose ends, it was extremely well done. Even the oompah-loompahs were funny, but not frightening like they were in the Gene Wilder movie, Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory. I hate to compare this film to the Gene Wilder movie though, because this is not a remake of that film, this is a second try at dramatizing the novel. This film is much closer to the book though. Everything in this movie made perfect sense, you can really fall into this film, parts of it actually make you want to find your own golden ticket and tour the factory along with everyone else."
"halfbreed_angel","10","3","6","15 July 2005"," Chocolate surprise
","Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is a great movie that I saw when it first came out. I thought that Charlie and the Chocolate Factory would be a corny remake of the 1970's version, but I was far from right. It was actually the best movie I seen this year. Tim Burton does great visual effects as well as special effects. The songs that the Oompa Loompas sing in the movie were rank, but still enjoyable. The Oompa Loompas themselves were acceptable as I continued to watch the movie. Johnny Depp played an enjoyable yet weird and creepy version of Willy Wonka. The kids in this film I thought were almost as good as the cast of kids in the original. They didn't act as spoiled as they were intended to be. The new direction Tim Burton put in this movie I found to be a pleasant surprise. This is a highly enjoyable and very clean movie with no violence and swearing. It's worth the watch with your family.<br/><br/>Perfect 10 out of 10!"
"nubby_G","10","3","6","15 July 2005"," What a wonderful film. Totally exceeded expectations.
","When I first saw the trailers for this, I thought it looked pretty bad. I am a huge fan of Tim Burton, so I had no doubt it would be interesting, but for the most part, it just looked pretty stupid. But, let me tell you, the trailers are misleading. Any stupid one liners you hear in the trailers or on-line or where ever, are totally hilarious when put into context with the film. The script is well written, and Depp is perfect for the role of the brooding, semi creepy anti social Willy Wonka. The music is wonderful, and captures the crazy world the Dahl created and Burton put onto the silver screen perfectly. With your classic Danny Elfman music, mixed in with some little electronic bleeps and bloops (similar to Invader Zim) the soundtrack is great. The characters, though I felt that we did not see much of them (with the exception of Willy Wonka and Charlie Bucket) were well cast and seemingly perfect for the roles that they portray. The sets are colorful and fun, and very imaginative along with some interesting flashbacks that give us some deep insight on the past of Willy Wonka. Roy Deep makes a perfect Oompa Loompa, and the songs that accompany his appearance are really crazy and cool, and the lyrics are also straight from the book. So, all in all, I think this is a fantastic film. Perhaps Burtons best work since Batman Returns. I had my doubts, but PLEASE don't judge this movie on what you see in the ads. Go see it, and then pass judgement on it. I had a blast. It is a lighthearted, kind of dark fantasy that will appeal to almost anyone. So, give it a chance."
"lostbrokenconfused","10","3","6","15 July 2005"," Much better then the first
","I'm a big Tim Burton fan, and a bigger Willy Wonka fan. This new movie is quite the opposite of the old movie. This movie is based off the book and heads in a different direction then the old movie. There's also a great ending. It don't leave you off like the last one did. This one also helps you understand Mr. Wonka MUCH more, it gets deep into his past and even shows HOW the Oompa Loompas came to live with him and how their life was before they lived with Wonka. It's a great move all in all, you should all go see it, you won't be sorry, it is not a waste of money, trust me. This is one of the best movies this summer. You find out why Willy wanted to be a candy man."

","I was very nervous about taking the kids to this one. Tim Burton is usually very dark - but this was a fantastic kids movie. I loved the Umpa-lumpa's updated songs. Very Nice!! I thought the kids characters did an excellent job at portraying the original characters. My 4 yr old loved it! However, if you are a die hard fan of the old one (like my husband) you may be disappointed with the additional story lines. They also leave some of the original silly stuff out. However - I found I liked the updated version. I also plan on buying the original book to read to the kids.<br/><br/>The ending was a pleasant surprise!!!!!!! And Johnny Depp is so fantastic. He is truly one of the most amazing actors of our time. He was totally able to lose you in the Willy Wonka character - never did you think of any of his other roles.

Of course, the boy from Finding Neverland, Freddie Highmore, is fabulous again as Charlie. What a talented little boy. And as his grandfather, the wonderful David Kelly, who we loved as the gypsy grandfather in Into the West and the aging convict in Greenfingers. Tim Burton has endless imagination.

Johnny Depp has always, and will always be my FAVORITE actor, as for Tim Burton with directing. Ever since I saw ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"", I knew as soon as I saw that preview of this movie, I would absolutely love it. And you know what? I did! Johnny Depp did a VERY good role of Willy Wonka. He was just as I picture him: Freaky, Odd, and a bit sad. Some of his lines made me laugh with tears going down my cheeks! Also, Freddie Highmore was so adorable and kind, he reminded me of the original Charlie. Also, Veruca could've been a little bit more brattier. But remember: THIS VERSION WAS MORE BASED ON THE BOOK. Also, I was watching something on HBO, and the man's family who had created this wonderful book even said that they liked this version better than the other!! The Oopma Loompa's were VERY enjoyable as well, but I did miss the original song that they sung. I give this movie a 10/10 rating! Go see it! You won't regret it."
"tlshelton46","10","3","6","15 July 2005"," Charlie and the Chocolate Factoy
","This movie is incredibly fantastic. Burton, Depp and Elfman, have done it again. I recently revisited the 1971 version, ""Willie Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"" since it had been so long. The first thing I would like to say, (as Tim Burton has said in similar words) This is not really a re-make. It's an original movie, that just happens to be similar to the other, since both of the movies ideas are based on the same book by Roald Dahl. I think people who liked the 1971 version can still enjoy this one, without feeling disloyal to the other. Nobody but Tim Burton could have done it well enough to be able to say there is room for two Willie Wonka movies. Absolutely no one could ever play Willie Wonka as great as Johnny Depp, he is a master. Freddie Highmore is an incredible Charlie Bucket, that kid is amazing and surely is going places(Very talented, may very well be the Johnny Depp of his generation) As for the rest of the cast, they were chosen equally as well. The visuals and musical score are phenomenal. I don't want to be critical of the movie critics, I have read their reviews, and I just don't understand. I learned a long time ago, if the trailers looked interesting to me, just go and see it. I have rarely been disappointed in my own judgment."

The soundtrack by Danny Elfman ( another great ) is excellent and makes the movie even more entertaining. Freddie Highmore is an excellent Charlie and the other kids are very amusing to watch. Last but not least, Johnny Depp is a wonderful Wonka. He makes the character come alive in a creepy but sweet way. It's a wonderful film that is definitely worth the money.

","I just went to see this movie today with my 3 year old and what a treat... The scenery in the movie is fabulous, the kids are great and my favorite part surprisingly, were the Oompa Loompa dance numbers! They are all done in a different genre... very entertaining. Willy Wonka is a bit bizarre, I must admit. A little creepy in the beginning and then he grows on you. Charlie was a delight not annoying like the original. All the scenes were great, from the Bucket house, to the factory, to the elevator. Overall, I was thoroughly surprised. I love the original with Gene Wilder, but this one was actually better to me. NO Slugworth whispering in the kids ears was a treat. Charlie actually has a mother and a FATHER in this one. The only thing I like better from the original is that the original Veruca Salt was a bit nastier than this one. Other than that, it was great.<br/><br/>I do recommend this for a family."

Some people have said that this movie was going to be ""darker"" than ""Willy Wonka"" with Gene Wilder, but it wasn't really. There are a few darker moments, but on the whole it's HILARIOUS!!! If you loved Johnny Depp as Captain Jack Sparrow, you'll love him as Willy Wonka. He's quirky, and a bit goofy at times, but it's intentional and very funny! <br/><br/>They've updated some of the kids and parents a bit, but not so much that it detracts from the film. The Oompa-Loompas are really funny, and their musical numbers are really cool! <br/><br/>I loved Danny Elfman's music, and I'm definitely going to buy the soundtrack for this one.

Tim Burton and Johnny Depp are an amazing pairing and this movie continues to prove it.<br/><br/>The storyline was very much the same as the original with a few alterations that for me, did not hurt the story or change it into something other than the classic tale.<br/><br/>Freddie Highmore was amazing as Charlie. He reminded me of the soft spoken Charlie of the original.<br/><br/>I was a bit disappointed by the Oompa Loompas. While I enjoyed the new songs, I still missed the original Oompa Loompa song. I would have liked to have seen them do a revamped version of that one. I was however, pleasantly surprised when they ran the credits and found out that Roald Dahl wrote the lyrics for the new songs. Seems he approved of Tim's stylings.<br/><br/>All in all, a must see for all of us who grew up with the Gene Wilder rendition. You know who you are!"

","I thought the movie was OK. I personally feel the the 1971 version was much much darker. It was more like Cat in the Hat rather then Charlie and The Chocolate Factory. I think children will really enjoy the movie. All the colors and funny looking men and their silly songs. As for adults, one might think the movie is lacking something. I thought the acting was good! And the makeup and the sets were pretty cool. There were things that were left out of the movie that would have been neat to see how they would do it now. I saw it on the IMAX screen, I think seeing it on the huge screen made it better! If any one asked,I would tell them to go see it, but don't be surprised when you realize its not what you expected (and try to see it at IMAX)"

This sick, psychotic piece of drivel should never be released on DVD or video and should be banned from this country. Though they say it is not a remake of the original film be a different interpretation of the book, it is neither. It is Tim Burton once again attempting to entertain us with his sick and demented views of life. He ruined Batman and now had taken to destroying another classic.

","I don't know where these people who liked this movie are coming from. It was a disaster compared to the Gene Wilder film. I figured they'd at least try to put a modern spin on it seeing as how it's a remake. But no, they basically attempted to remake the old one (better in their minds) but worse to real people. Unless you're a kid who has never seen the original I don't know how you could like this. Sitting thru the movie is a pain, by the end you realized ""I just wasted two hours of my life."" The movie didn't even have a new spin, nothing original, just taking stuff from the book and the first movie and making a much worse movie.<br/><br/>Worst of all, the Oompa-Loompas were crap, no little people (midgets for us who live in the real world).

"WilyManc","1","4","10","6 September 2005"," Awful!
","What a terrible film! Drab and uninspired, messy and full of some poor special effects, (especially Violet's demise); with a glass elevator sequence taken straight from the equally bad Hitchhiker's Guide film. And Johnny Depp - what happened to him? I love the man, but he was asleep for most of this film. And as for the dialogue, it's dull and full of out of place expressions, (what are the grandpas doing talking about candy and pants?). The whole film seems poorly constructed as a hasty series of poorly written scenes. And the idea behind the Oompa Lumpas was a mistake from the start, (and poorly cast with it). What a huge disappointment when the idea of Tim Burton, Danny Elfman, and Johnny Depp reunited on this project seemed so promising."
"thumpergirl03","1","4","10","8 August 2005"," total DISAPPOINTMENT
","And yes I meant for it all to be capitalized. It's really annoying that there are so many good reviews about this film. I agree with all you who gave it nothing but a 1. I saw this movie a few weeks ago and I must say I didn't walk out with smile on my face. For starters, the special fx were overdone and hardly any of the movie looked real. The fact that the oompa loompas were all played by Deep Roy is just plain creepy, and their songs...yuck! The music was so loud it was hard to hear the lyrics. And now for Depp.. He should never of even thought of taking this role. I know this has been said before, but he was too much Micheal Jacksonesque. It just didn't have the magic of the 1971 Gene Wilder original. The thing I missed most was the classic oompa loompa song which was cute and childlike. But no Danny Elfman had to come in and completely mess it up. The humor of Charlie's dad stealing the toothpaste cap (or whatever it was) wasn't right. None of the kids seemed to have learned from their mistakes, and their parents didn't show any emotion about whatever was happening to the kid ( Augusta's mom didn't scream when he was being sucked up the pipe) like she did in the original, And Veruka's dad instead of being thrown in the ""bad egg"" shoot with her, was carried along by the squirrels following her.<br/><br/>Overall Freddie Highmore as Charlie was OK but that's it. If you enjoyed the original I would suggest don't bother seeing this piece of garbage."

","I was expecting something great from the reviews, and was so disappointed. I found Depp just plain creepy. I thought the pace was very slow, and the oompa loompa concept was just lame. I found this movie to be an awkward mess. I took my four year old daughter and she was bored stiff. And the ending....Man, I thought this was a real stinker. You could tell there was a lot of computer animation by the dull or bored looks on the actors' faces when there should have been great emotion of some sort. There should have been so much more intensity in this movie. It was like watch a colorful but boring play. If you want a great family movie watch THE INCREDIBLES, IRON GIANT, FLY AWAY HOME< SEARCHING FOR BOBBY FISCHER, TOY STORY 1 and 2, BABE 1 and 2 and so many other great films."
"russellelly","1","4","10","1 August 2005"," A poor show all-round
","I'm genuinely not sure where to start on this, it was so awful. Being a big fan of the original, one of the best movies ever made I didn't really want to see a different version, but was coaxed into it, and boy, I wish I wasn't.<br/><br/>I have to disagree with the majority who had a liking for Grandpa Jo. He's meant to be an unassuming character, he doesn't choose to go with Charlie - Charlie chooses him! And he doesn't do daft Irish dancing either. It's not flipping Riverdance. This Grandpa Jo, like all the characters, could not be easily connected to. Seeing the original get up from his bed brought a smile to my face. Watching Riverdance did not.<br/><br/>The children were below average, certainly not a patch on the class of '71. Veruca Salts in particular seemed incapable of portraying the 'daddy's little girl' image which was a great touch to the original. Charlie Bucket managed to portray the poor boy at the beginning, but after meeting Wonka this seemed to diminish. The others did the job, nothing more, nothing less, but they had little to work with.<br/><br/>The parents were worse than the kids. Veruca Salts' father was perhaps the least convincing character I've seen in my life. Did he have a second tone to his voice - a distressed one perhaps? No. Nothing. And as the kids were whisked away one by one the parents seemed to show absolutely no emotion - absolutely senseless.<br/><br/>Everything I can say about the songs and the Oompa-Loompas has been said before, but lets say I wasn't impressed. The original songs were timeless. These seemed dated already (it's passed the 1990s!).<br/><br/>The flashbacks were charming and pointless in equal measure. The little Willy Wonka at Hallowe'en I could sympathise with, but the mystery of Wonka was then gone. They did little but to detract from the plot.<br/><br/>And Depp. What can I say? Random would be an understatement, and the viewer felt no attachment to him whatsoever. The Jackson similarities were uncanny at times. He seemed disturbed, whilst Wilder was eccentric, yet warm. The latter was far more appealing.<br/><br/>Somehow the plot lines, like the film as a whole, seemed forced and very unnatural. The lines from the original seemed out of place, yet changing them seemed like it was just for the sake of it. Why were there squirrels and not geese? Why was it chocolate television and not Wonkavision? Why Mike's father, not his mother? And why, oh why, was there no flaw by Charlie? Getting in the Wonkavator (sorry, elevator) before Charlie had won, and Wonka refusing to let Charlie's folks in the factory when he had won? Inexcusble.<br/><br/>As the credits rolled I was shaking my head. Literally. Watch the original version, read the book, but whatever you do, don't waste good money on this film."
"rowdyroddypeeper","1","4","10","30 July 2005"," Warning! this review contains spoilers
","As a fan of the original i was already a bit biased towards how the new one would be, but nonetheless i thought id give it a shot, what with the new war of the worlds being so damn good. To start Johnny Depps Wonka to start with was just creepy, but not creepy in a Gene Wilders Wonka kinda way, not even creepy in a Michael Jackson way, this guy must've been related to Charlie Manson or Ted Bundy. Firstly he hates parents can't even say the word without retching, thought fair enough as we're treated to his past with his abuse father. But then you realise he hates children too. Well thats just stupid, why invite 5 kids to come to your factory with the aim of giving one the factory if you don't like them, IE snapping at mike teavee for mumbling. Hey thats the play-station generation matey. the Oompa Loompas were just atrocious, or rather one oompa loompa made to look like hundreds with the help of cgi. There songs were bland and rubbish, like something out of a spice girls concert. Plus you couldn't really understand them anyway. Everything seemed rushed, mainly the part where they go off and eat from the main part of the factory, it was a bit like supermarket sweep, like right you've got 2 minutes go grab what you can GO! Oops Augustus seems to have fallen into the chocolate river, oh well onward ho. And thats pretty much it for the most part, there goes another kid. By the end only Charlie's left, who didn't have much of a part in it anyway, he kinda just spend the whole time asking Wonka about his past, causing flashbacks. By this time Wonka it's like oh you're the only kid left i suppose you can help run the factory (notice this time he doesn't give him the factory, no he wants charlie to come up with new ideas as he obviously has lot his touch, doesn't want charlie's family coming in either. Probably so he can squeeze some slave labour out of it, i bet charlie ain't even on the minimum wage) Which is a thing he didn't really seem to care who got the factory this time, why didn't he put a job advert in the local job centre, would've saved a lot of time. Overall this film is like Edward Scissorhands without hands, nothing really of interest to grab you, no heart no emotion, no feel good factor. Proof that using CGI wont save a dire film."

This movie's only purpose was to line pocket-books with bloodstained silver pieces. I felt dirty leaving the theater. Shame on anyone involved in the making of this travesty. I really believe any film made in Hollywood costing over a certain amount will purposely lack intelligence and elegance and certainly charm. I am very disappointed and saddened."
"mapsnmad","1","4","10","30 July 2005"," Very disappointed -- flat performance, dull script, important points missing ...
","... from the story, which, after all, did have a moral or two tucked in there amid all the candy and fun, unlike this movie, which seems to have missed most of the point of the story. The saddest thing about this dismal effort was Johnny Depp's performance -- I can't help but wonder how much of that can be his fault, seeing what little the script gave him to work with.<br/><br/>I really wanted to like this film, and was so looking forward to seeing it. What a shame that this movie's Willie Wonka was far, far less interesting, lovable or even understandable than the one Gene Wilder played, or the fellow in the books this was based on. Save yourself from this dull, heartless movie and see the old 70s one instead. Dated though it is (and with a few tedious songs you could fast forward through), it has a few crucial things that this film lacked: wisdom, heart and a clear sense of the difference between right and wrong -- the wicked got their just desserts, and the good were rewarded. This movie's Wonka was little more than a creepy, maladjusted, self-absorbed man-child (eerily reminiscent of an infamous singer who recently escaped prison by the pale skin of his crumbling nose). The earlier Wonka was both child-like and yet sophisticated, intelligent and witty, a gracious host as well as a canny judge of character. Depp's (or should we say Burton's?) Wonka is petulant, indifferent and, worst of all, just not that interesting to see or hear.<br/><br/>Deep Ray was cute as the Oompaloompahs, though -- too bad the songs he/they sang were neither very relevant, nor intelligible. Half the lyrics were buried in the music."

","I saw this film on the 21st of July with a friend who felt the the songs were awful and that Johnny Depp's performance was irritating. I'll agree with her on the Oompa Loompa songs despite my love for Deep Roy and Danny Elfman, however I feel differently about her opinion on Johnny Depps performance. I thought it was great! I mean I can understand if people are put off by his resemblance to MJ(which I only see in pictures and not in the movie) and his drawing from Mr rogers and the like. But his performance was original, and that the point. If it was closer to Gene wilder's performance than there wouldn't have been anything for anybody to mull over. He sticks in your mind, and he's great for the kids. In regards to the whole Christopher lee thing, I love him and I thought the subplot was nice at first but the ending was forgettable to me. they should have focused on Wonka's inability to trust after having his secrets stolen from him. oh well...<br/><br/>other than that I love the cinematography, art direction, costume design, score and the make-up! Tim Burton is a wonderful visionary!"

My husband and son and I laughed throughout, I thought Depp was brilliant. The theater was 3/4 full... and the laughter and enjoyment rang throughout place. <br/><br/>There are going to people who won't like it (""weird"" as Depp/Wonka would say), people who are going to nitpick (""mumblers! I can't hear you!"") and people who feel the need to compare. Okay... sorry for your luck.<br/><br/>I, however, would like to walk up to Burton and Depp and give them a big hug and a thank you for the laughter and the fun they gave us last night. Brilliant as always, boys!"
"demi_momus","1","4","10","28 July 2005"," Terrible
","I saw this movie with much reluctance after my friends gave me a hard time about saying how it looked awful and judging it before I saw it. Let me start by saying this movie IS awful, and much of that is because of the highly overrated sir Johnny Depp. Not only does Depp spoil Wonka as a character, but he tarnishes the entire movie by ""acting"" in it.<br/><br/>Normally I would have nothing against Tim Burton (although I can't say the same about Depp) but for some reason, he doesn't really attach the viewer to the movie. Yes, it does have its moments, but it is overthrown by jokes that fall flat and are usually even unnecessary and crude. Also the movie is nothing like the book. Most viewers would expect at least similar plot lines as the original, but no, there is barely anything the same about this and the book, which could considered either a good thing or a bad thing, but in my opinion, a bad thing. Burton even manages to leave out the unforgettable scene with Charlie and his grandfather nearly being killed as they float with bubbles, the scene is a must have for any remake. <br/><br/>The characters don't fit at all. All the kids are annoying, which they may have been meant to be, but it is so unpleasant for the viewer. Don't get me started on the adults, geez... all I will say is way worse then all the kids. Not to mention that all the characters clash throughout. Even without the tremendous plot holes, this movie would still blow. Save your time and your money and spend it doing something more useful then seeing this trash. You could even go buy and 2x4 and repeatedly bash your head with it and it would be more fulfilling. Cheers."
"FMACDONALD","10","4","10","25 July 2005"," One Of Tim Burton's Best Films!!!!!
","Charlie And The Chocolate Factory will be labeled and looked at as (what most movie fans fear) a remake. However it's not. It's not even close to the original which starred Gene Wilder and is one of my top 100 favorite films of all time. Willy Wonka & The Chocolate Factory was so far off form the book which was written by Rohl Dahl that Dahl (Who was rumored to detest the original) refused to sign off for a sequel. If Dahl was alive today he would have been very happy with Burton's version. It is practically word for word, scene for scene just like the book of the same name. The plot is simple. Willy Wonka is a candy god. The world worships him. Then for reasons which I will not explain because that would spoil the movie for you he closes his candy factory forever. Then out of the clear blue he decides that he is not only going to open the doors again but he is going to allow five lucky children to tour his factory, something that has never been allowed before. He runs this contest by putting five golden tickets in his Wonka Bars. The five lucky kids are Augustis Gloop a heavy kid from Germany who lives, breathes, and sleeps for chocolate. Tehn we have Violet Borogard. A little girl from Atlanta Georgia who's motto is winning is everything. She hates finishing any place but the top. Then we have Veruca Salt. A spoiled little rich girl from Birmingham, England. She has a father who's opinion on the world is money can buy everything. There's also Mike Tevee who's life revolves video games. He's a snot nosed punk who will stop at nothing to insult, cut down, or humiliate anyone in his path. Then finally we have Charlie Bucket. A bright little boy who has the heart of gold. He lives in a shack with his parents and his four grandparents. They barely have any money to put food on the table. Charlie is extremely tight with his Grandpa Joe. Who fascinates Charlie with his stories of Willy Wonka. Charlie is the one child who wants this prize more than anybody and deserves it because unlike all the other spoiled brats in the film Charlie is a working class blue collar kid who you just can't help but feel bad for. After the tickets are found the children meet the man who is their hero. Willy Wonka himself played by Tin Burton alumni Johnny Depp (Edward Scissorhands, Ed Wood, Sleepy Hollow, and the upcoming animated Burton film The Corpse Bride)who holds his own as Mr. Wonka. Milly is nothing what these kids think he's going to be. He's rude, brash, and a complete wise ass. In one scene when Violet throws her arms around him and says ""I'm Violet Borogard"" Wonka looks down at her with an uncomfortable expression and replies ""I don't care"". The chocolate factory is a child's imagination come to life and no one has an eye for eye candy the way Tim Burton does. If you've never seen a Burton film then check out Beetle Juice, Edward Scissorhands, Sleepy Hollow, or The Nightmare Before Christmas and you'll see what I mean. This movie has restored my faith in Burton when ""remaking"" a classic (although as i said before this film is not a remake) but I'm a Burton junkie and have loved all his movies, yes even Planet of the Apes (yes I'm the one). After the debacle that was Planet Of The Apes (2000) it looked like Burton's career was over. The movie was a bomb and loathed by most fans that saw it basically giving a lot of heat about the ending (although P.O.T.A. has a better ending than the recent War Of The Worlds remake I've been told)but Burton bounced back with the masterpiece Big Fish. He hasn't dropped the ball since. Charlie And The Chocolate Factory is one of Tim Burton's best films and has great eye candy as well as laugh's with Depp's Wonka and the Oompa Loompa's (all played by one man who's been CGI'd to make millions of Oompa Loompa's) and the songs in the films are funny as hell. As for Depp, he hold's his own as Willy Wonka. Believe me he has some big shoes to fill from Gene Wilder's Wonka. However as I said before this movie is so different from the original it falls into the apples and oranges category. It's hard to compare which one is better. The original is still a great film that I will always love. Burton's version ranks right up there with it. Burton's version is almost scene for scene, word for word just like the book. The original is not even close. Which is why I can't even compare the two as well as tell you who was the better Willy Wonka. Again apples and oranges. If you want a good time at the movies where you can just leave your brain at the door and get lost in a weird, wonderful world then i highly recommend Charlie And The Chocolate Factory. Burton fans will love it. It ranks up there with Sleepy Hollow, Mars Attacks, Beetle Juice, Edward Scissorhands, and Big Fish. Even people that have never seen a Burton film (Pee-Wee's Big Adventure, Beetle Juice, Batman, Edward Scissorhands, Batman Returns, The Nightmare Before Christmas, Ed Wood, Mars Attacks, Sleepy Hollow, Planet Of The Apes, Big Fish and the upcoming Corpse Bride) will have a tough time not enjoying Charlie And The Chocolate Factory. It's a great time at the movies. Heck you'll find yourself wanting to go by candy as soon as the credits begin to roll. On a scale of 10 I give Charlie And The Chocolate Factory a 10. Go and enjoy. You won't regret it."
"coolness_rookie","2","4","10","17 July 2005"," Disappointing.
","When a movie is based on a novel, it should be able to depict an unexpected visualization of the novel in order to be fresh to the audience. This movie FAILS to do so.<br/><br/>Everything in the movie was so obvious and unoriginal. There could be so much more fascinating things and events that they could have created inside the factory, but they didn't. Everything looked just like how they were described in the book, which really bored me to death throughout the movie.<br/><br/>The actors in this movie were quite pathetic. Johnny Depp was the only one that HAD a personality. The rest of the characters were just there, and each of them showed one emotion throughout the whole movie. (I'd like to give some examples but I don't wanna give away ) OK, it maybe interesting at the beginning, but after 2 hrs of the movie, you get very tired of their monotonic acting.<br/><br/>I simply do not see what is the real goal or mood of this movie. I don't know if its supposed to be funny or meaningful. It tries to connect with a particular theme, but the movie fails to draw the audience well enough for them to actually connect with it. It also tries to somehow be funny here and there by Johnny Depp's ""unique"" facial expression, but there was not one time during the movie that I laughed. The ""jokes"" just seemed forced and were really not funny at all.<br/><br/>So my suggestion is ""Don't watch this movie, especially if you have read the book."" There really is no point in it. The movie is so predictable that before you even watch the movie, you probably know everything about how the movie will proceed.<br/><br/>*** If you HAVE TO go to the movie theater to watch something though, watch ""Wedding Crashers"" instead. It is a lot funnier and fresher. =)"

","(Synopsis) Willy Wonka (Johnny Depp) has built the greatest and largest chocolate factory in the world. After some of his workers steal his secret recipes, Willy Wonka kicks his workers out and closes the doors. For 15 years, no one has seen any workers entering or leaving the factory, yet his chocolate candy is still being produced and shipped around the world. One day when Willy Wonka is getting his hair cut, he realizes that he is getting old, and he needs a successor. He comes up with a plan to open his factory and reveal his secrets to five lucky children, who find golden tickets inside Wonka chocolate bars. The golden tickets are sent around the world and soon 4 winners are announced. There is one ticket left, and Charlie Bucket (Freddie Highmore) finds the last ticket. Charlie's Grandpa Joe (David Kelly) is going to accompany Charlie inside the factory where he once worked before it was closed. The five children with their parents and Grandpa Joe enter the factory and begin a tour of a lifetime. The factory is not like your standard factory, but a living factory with a chocolate waterfall and a river of chocolate that you can ride a boat down. The trees and grass are edible, and trained squirrels shell nuts for the chocolate bars. All the work is now being done by the Oompa-Loompas tribe, who work for cocoa beans. Four of the rotten children get to interact with some of Willy Wonka's fantastic inventions with unfortunate consequences which force them off the tour before it is completed. Charlie is the last child left, and Willy Wonka awards Charlie the greatest prize of all, the keys to the factory.<br/><br/>(Comment) The film is not like the 1971 original with Gene Wilder as a gentle and nice person, but it follows the book where Willy Wonka is an eccentric and crazy person. Johnny Depp pulls out all the stops and sometimes goes overboard by being a little too freaky and creepy. By the end of the movie, we discover the reason for his being so strange. I didn't like the Hollywood and Rock and Roll musical numbers, performed by the Oompa-Loompas in this movie even though I liked their performance in the original. This movie has some dark and bizarre moments and is definitely not for young children, even though it has a PG rating. (Warner Brothers Pictures, Run time 1:55, Rated PG)(7/10)"
"Splinter411","5","16","64","11 July 2005"," See Depp In ""Michael Jackson""
","Johnny Depp made a heck of a gamble to do a Keith Richards imitation in ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" and it paid off. In ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,"" he tries out Michael Jackson and it fails miserably. How amazing that in the original, Gene Wilder is what made the film succeed in spite of its f/x limitations, while here when the film succeeds it's in spite of Johnny Depp's off acting. Keep in mind, I'm a huge fan of Depp's, so his performance comes as a shock to me.<br/><br/>I also think the darkness Burton adds to the story is to the detriment of a child enjoying this material as much as they could. Furthermore, one of the key elements of the original was the beautiful connection between Charlie and his grandfather. Though they tried to make it happen again, it just didn't feel anywhere close to as rich.<br/><br/>I have no doubt this film will do well, but it's only because the original material is so good and they're smart enough to be faithful to it most of the time. I say ""smart enough,"" because when they do stray, it's usually for something strange as opposed to better. That's often the case with any Burton movie -- he never quite understands the difference between weird being ""new and exciting"" and just ""strange and uncomfortable."" When Burton gets it right, it's always a pleasure, when he gets it wrong, you always wonder what might have been.<br/><br/>If there's one good thing that comes out of this film, it's that it may inspire children to seek out the far superior original. Gene Wilder can rest assured that the purple Wonka hat still belongs firmly nestled on his head."

","As per usual the team of Johnny Depp and director Tim Burton can always be counted on to deliver from the dark-side. Thus it is with this remake of Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory though this was actually done under its original title.<br/><br/>Depp expands his list of quirky characters and expands his range which I think is bigger than any other player around today. His chocolate magnate Willy Wonka is a dark character, so different than Gene Wilder back in the day. His character is great, but it might have frightened a few little tykes going to a family film.<br/><br/>The story is basically the same, young Charlie Buckets a kid from a poor and extended family where both sets of grandparents are all under one roof. He lives in a town where years ago all the human workers were given the sack from the Wonka Chocolate Factory and it became fully automated. What grief he must have gotten from organized labor can only be imagined.<br/><br/>Anyway Wonka who's become so obsessed with being the Chocolate King he's got no family and no heirs. We're not even sure, but that he might be celibate. He's put five gold tickets in one of his millions of Wonka Bars and the lucky five kids who get them win a trip inside his factory where no one has been.<br/><br/>Charlie turns out to be one of the five and accompanied by his grandfather and the other kids and their guardians he takes a magical tour of the place. They meet the little tribe of Oompa-Loompas who live and work in the factory.<br/><br/>Freddie Highmore is an earnest young Charlie. I do miss Jack Albertson as the grandfather from the first film. He registers far better than David Kelly in this one.<br/><br/>The film really is a star vehicle for Johnny Depp, more so than the first film was for Gene Wilder. You'll like it, it's like biting into that first Wonka Bar."

","I loved this movie.I think it is great.I saw the trailers and when i heard Johnny Depp was going to be Willy Wonka i knew it was going to be fantastic.He makes a great Willy Wonka and so does Gene Wilder.Both movies were perfectly cast and the stories were great.I have both of them and enjoy watching each one.At first i was a little thrown off because Johnny Depp's version was so different but i watched it a 2nd time and have enjoyed it ever since and so does my 6 year old son.He likes to act out the seen with the squirrels.But the thing with the Gene Wilder one is i tend to fast forward through the song Charlie's mom sings because it is so boring and when they show it on TV they cut out the boat scene and that is one of my favorite parts.Tim Burton should make the sequel to it called Charlie and the great glass elevator.I have read the book and think it would make a good movie.I am a huge fan of Johnny Depp and with out him the movie would not have been so great.That is my opinion and take it as you will."
"inframan","2","3","7","30 August 2006"," NOT for my kids...
","Call me a grinch but I found this movie pretty heavy-handed & mean-spirited. I've liked Depp in other things, but his Willy Wonka seems like a called-in performance, on the order of a high-school play where the boys play the girls. <br/><br/>There's a lot of malevolence that seeps through, too, which although pretty common in Tim Burton movies, is really quite pronounced in this one. <br/><br/>The golden-ticket winners are all pretty much set-up as the more reprehensible representatives of a self-involved & greedy society but even so their rather gross methods of dispatch & WW's glee comes off as pretty creepy for family fare. Everything that works in his film is an obvious tribute/homage/borrowing from earlier (& better IMO) films, especially ""The 5000 Fingers of Dr. T"" & the final scene in ""Kid Millions"".<br/><br/>It's not that I would worry about the mental health of my kids seeing this, it's that their health is good enough that I know they would find it seriously wanting."

","This movie was a total waste of my time. Awful!!!I can't believe I watched 10 min., let alone almost an hour of that disaster. Johnny Depp is a great actor in any movie he's in, but you can't re-make a classic!!!!! It's like trying to re-make ""Bambi"" or ""Chitty Chitty Bang Bang"". It can't be done!! I think if this movie made any money, it was because the original was so great. People were fooled into thinking this movie would be just as good and I'm sure ended up just as disappointed as I was & am. At least the original movie had many Oompa Loompas, not a digitalized repeat of the same actor - OVER & OVER. How cheesy!! Also Willy Wonka wasn't ""psychotic"", he was ""eccentric"". If anyone out there agrees, please let people know!!! Also if your child has never seen the original movie, go out & buy it!!! You can't change the songs the Oompas sang, they are CLASSICS!!! My son (19yrs old now)grew up with the original movie, I made him watch it at least once a year. Well, now he knows what makes the original - the best!!!"
"brybo","1","3","7","20 August 2006"," Charlie I don't care.....
","What a painful movie, poorly acted, poorly directed. It is a great surprise, from Johnny Depp, who always provides a watchable movie. Here you only notice how much those teeth are bugging him. In fact, I noticed it so much that it was BOTHERING ME!<br/><br/>There wasn't much to say WOW! What a great movie, I hated the Oompa-Loompa's. You never felt anything for any of the characters. Well, maybe just a little. They could have been bounced a little harder, because they were so ANNOYING!<br/><br/>Visual effects were also, nothing to write home to mother about. I don't know about the IMAX's version, but what I saw was pretty blah.<br/><br/>Bottom line here, it was creepy and NOT worth the time."
"glgioia","6","3","7","8 January 2006"," Sensually Stimulating, Cerebally Deadening
","Like most of Burton's work, 99.98% of the energy here and Id imagine budget went straight to set design and costume, and the perfect camera-work to get it juuust right. I admit that Tim Burton has made a couple of films that I count among my favorites. When it works, its pretty damn amazing. But as we are reminded in Charlie, more often then not, it doesn't work. To be fair, I cant really knock the visual impact this film delivers. And if that alone sates your movie-going appetite, you will love Charlie. If you are like me however, and expect more for your 11 quid than 5 music videos linked by an insipid narrative with hollow characterizations, Charlie is quite likely to make you once again involuntarily utter, 'man there's a lot of bad movies out there these days.' <br/><br/>Tim Burton presents Charlie and the Chocolates Factory and ostensibly seeks to pull off not just a remake, but a re-telling more in line with the actual Roald Dahl's children's classic. What was wrong with the Gene Wilder film? Good question. Again visually its the bomb-digger, you cant argue with it. Plotwise, for the most part, ain't bad. So whats the problem you ask? The film doesn't play, at all!! The characters especially the main characters other than Wonka and perhaps Charlie, have about as much flesh on them as the Corpse Bride and muster zero sympathy. The film wows your senses and even delights you with the song and dance numbers, the only real achievement of the film in my estimation, but does a very poor job in storytelling. Very poor. The emotional impact that touched all of my generation, is nowhere to be found in the remake. We get this quandary a lot now with these remakes that are so technically superior to their predecessor, that you feel stupid not calling them an improvement on the original. As far as the Charlie comparison is concerned, the remake's only attribute is that it helps make the original shine even more brilliantly. Which sadly brings me to my final observation. This film has the distinction of showcasing Johhny Depp in what might be his worst characterization of his great career. Depps Wonka looks for all the world like a Technicolor incarnation of the fiend in the lost silent classic, London After Midnight. He 'acts' like the alleged fiend known as pop star Michael Jackson, and sounds exactly like Dustin Hoffman's Tootsie!!!! Put a hatchet in his hand, and you'd have the makings of a good Hammer film. Doesn't exactly work or belong here, Sheila."
"rattdpp","1","3","7","1 January 2006"," Awful
","This movie missed the mark in almost every respect. It was dull and uninspired. The worst job I have ever seen Depp do with a character. It was not consistent at all - it was rather a mish-mash of different inspirations and lacked any sense of continuity. This entire project lacked the spark that the original had in any way, shape, or form. waste of time, film and effort. Even Elfman fell flat this time with the musical score - miles of bad road all around for everyone. There is nearly nothing good to say about this film - interesting to see some of the background of the Charlie character although that was rather twisted in the hands of Burton as well."
"dayray-1","1","3","7","27 December 2005"," terrible
","I love Johnny Depp. Brilliant actor. Terrible movie. Jim Carry would have been brilliant in this. Sorry Johnny. In the same note, Jim Carry would have been awful in Pirates of the Caribbean, which Depp was BRILLIANT. And just so, Depp would have been terrible in The Mask. All said and done, Depp is brilliant, but NOT IN THIS FILM.<br/><br/>Kids were perfectly cast, but sucked because of the screenplay. Visuals were great, but Johnny sucked because he HAD NOTHING OT WORK WITH.<br/><br/>TERRIBLE. A TOTAL WASTE OF 2 HOURS. Go rent Bridges Over Madison County or Top Gun or go play hockey with your kid in the park. At least you can say you never once in your life wasted an hour or two."
"UltraJoe","10","3","7","3 September 2005"," Depp beats Wilder!
","I must admit, I've never read Dahl's book. I only have Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, starring Gene Wilder, to compare this movie against. I have to say, though, that this version is superb! Johnny Depp is an amazing character actor ... one could never imagine his Willy Wonka having anything whatsoever to do with Captain Jack Sparrow or Edward Scissorhands.<br/><br/>The story is wonderful, showing, as always, how the impossible can somehow be possible. While it's obvious who wins the contest, the actual tension over Charlie finding a golden ticket was credible. The back-story of Willy's relationship with his father, and his having to deal with Charlie's close-knit family, was an added treat."

","I just saw it yesterday, and I seriously want to see it again. My inner child rather enjoyed it, which is ironic, because I'm only thirteen-years-old. But still, it will make you /feel/ like a kid again. I loved it. I thought Johnny Depp was PERFECT as Wonka. There are some jokes that you just want to repeat to all your friends when it's over. <br/><br/>I have to say, the Oompa Ooompa man scared me. But I'm weird like that, I s'pose. It's also a bit weird, but I fell in love with Willy Wonka. He's rather rude, but he doesn't care. When I got home from the theater, I just got rid of all these items in my room that I didn't really need, because I saw how happy Charlie was, and I wanted that.<br/><br/>Yep. Charlie found the golden ticket. Brilliant. Amazing. Watch it. NOW. Off you go."
"skibbleyboo66","9","3","7","22 July 2005"," More often than not, remakes fail miserably in trying to live up to the original.
","And this is one of those times that that just isn't true.<br/><br/>That said, it's truly difficult for me to compare this movie to the original; they hold two rather different moods. Johnny Depp's performance as the slightly eccentric Willy Wonka just seems different than Wilder's some 30 years ago. Where Wilder is the wise, witty man behind the factory who breaks out into song every now and then about imagination, Depp is flat-out weird. He almost seems a bizarre mix of Michael Jackson and Freddy Kreuger, yet he pulls it off perfectly. He's just not the kind of guy you want taking care of your kids, because he laughs and dances as they turn into behemoth blueberries, get sucked up giant pipes, and get dragged around by squirrels. And then he encourages you, the parent, to do the same! So why do we like this all-too-creepy man who just watches and waits as one by one, the children fall prey to some bizarre trap designed perfectly to ensnare the children based upon their oh-so-annoying faults? Honestly, I don't know. The viewer will find an aura about Depp as he acts, however, that, simply put, entrances the viewer into wanting to see more, to learn about his horrible, candiless past, and to learn of how he shamboozled the Oompa-Loompas into doing his nefarious bidding.<br/><br/>Or something.<br/><br/>And it doesn't hurt that the cast surrounding Willy Wonka is simply amazing. Each of the children, their parents, the Bucket family, and the Oompa-Loompas find themselves delivering top-notch performances. Honestly, I think the only character who might have been more fleshed-out would be Adam Godley, the man who plays Mr. Teavee. And yes, I know that perhaps he wasn't as fleshed out in the book. All I'm saying is that maybe it would've been nice if they had given him just one more joke or stunt. The family, especially Grandpa George and Grandma Georgina, are family-like, if that makes sense, while still being hilarious.<br/><br/>The musical numbers... honestly, they were a good change, though I will complain, as I so often do, in the fact that I really couldn't understand everything that was being said by the Oompa-Loompas. Still, they provided absolutely hilarious interludes between each child being taken away.<br/><br/>The factory, the main set of the movie, finds itself as being an environment that is a pure joy to view, with its colors, shapes, puppets, animals, and most importantly, candy everywhere one looks.<br/><br/>And all of this comes together to deliver a unique, enjoyable, and refreshing experience. Masterful."
"EmpressEmily","10","3","7","22 July 2005"," Willy Wonka, Willy Wonka, the amazing chocolateer, Willy Wonka, Willy Wonka, everybody give a cheer!
","I saw this movie just yesterday, and I was very impressed. Tim Burton's version of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is a feast for the eyes and the imagination.<br/><br/>As I watched the movie, I did not find myself comparing it to the 1971 version at all. This adaptation is not so much a remake as an entirely different interpretation of the story, and it is fascinating in its own right and for its own reasons. It is also remarkably faithful to Roald Dahl's book, and because I had read the book just before the movie came out, I found myself thinking, 'oh, that part's just like the book' or 'I remember that from the book' numerous times. In fact, many lines were taken directly from the book.<br/><br/>I will admit that when I saw the trailers I thought, 'Hm. . .Johnny Depp seems awfully weird in this movie. . .' and I was a little worried, but leave it to Johnny to think outside the box and come up with a brilliant performance as Wonka himself. Little Charlie Bucket was just perfect- I liked him a lot more than the Charlie in the other film. The rest of the Bucket family was much more likable than in the other film too. And the other four children, Augustus, Veruca, Violet and Mike, were all wonderfully portrayed. They represented perfectly all the bratty children that exist in this world. A unique approach was taken towards creating the Oompa-Loompas, them being just one person, digitally copied. The fact that they were all completely identical did not bother me at all (although this could be because the actor who played them was in The Neverending Story, my favourite movie), and did not make them any less interesting. However, I will admit that their songs were a bit bizarre, but the lyrics were taken straight from the book.<br/><br/>Every single second of the movie seems to have been thought out with great care and therefore the overall look of the film is very polished, as though no expense was spared to make the film look perfect. The only two things that bothered me were the fact that the setting of Charlie's home-town was not clear. I think it was supposed to be England, but I was not always sure. The other thing is the including of Willy Wonka's father and flashbacks of Willy's past. That was definitely not in the book and I was at a loss to understand why it was put in. Oh well, at least it didn't take away from the fun of the movie. Speaking of fun, I was laughing out loud in the theater. It was all just so amusing and clever and wonderful. Please, do see it. Don't let the weirdness bother you. There will be something to laugh over, I assure you."
"gcriotgirl294","9","3","7","22 July 2005"," Quite an excellent movie.
","I thought that Charlie and the Chocolate Factory was an excellent movie. I think that Johnny Depp portrayed Willy Wonka quite well, and the only thing I thought could have been improved was the Oompa Loompa songs. I thought they were good, but could've been a bit shorter. I thought that Tim Burton did a great job making this movie, and although friends of mine disliked it, I thought it was great. They said that they hated the Oompa Loompas and just over all the entire movie, but as I said before, I thought they were good, just a bit of a shorter song would've been nice. I also liked the ending of the movie, which, although different from the book, worked out quite nicely.<br/><br/>Yes, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory was an excellent movie, which I would recommend to anyone."
"Sy-4","9","3","7","22 July 2005"," Burton + Dahl = Magic
","I find it interesting to see so many people referring to this movie as a remake of the earlier movie with Gene Wilder. The way I see it, both movies are simply remakes of the fantastic vision described in Roald Dahl's book. Neither movie is perfect, but of the two I significantly prefer Tim Burton's effort.<br/><br/>Part of this simply comes down to a bigger budget and 34 years progress in special effects of course, but Burton's directing style and flair for juxtaposing the surreal with an exaggerated version of normality is just tailor-made for this job, and he does not let us down. The sets are beautiful, and the characters, with the exception of one, are spot-on perfect renderings of Dahl's caricatures. <br/><br/>Curiously enough, I think the weakest point of both movies is in their portrayals of Wonka himself. Gene Wilder was sufficiently eccentric, but just a tad too genial. The Wonka of the books has a distinctly callous streak and a cruel sense of humor. He obviously takes great delight in seeing the bad kids get what they deserve, for instance. On the other hand, Depp's Wonka perhaps goes too far the other way. He has the right kind of flippant indifference, but also has too many moments of self-doubt and uncertainty. The Wonka of the books was above all supremely confident in his own abilities. The flashbacks to Wonka's past in this movie just seemed to weaken the character.<br/><br/>But at the end of the day, these movies are adaptations and certain changes are inevitable. I liked Depps's Wonka, even if it wasn't quite what I expected.<br/><br/>A few highlights, in case you're not already convinced: <br/><br/><ul><li>The songs. I was laughing non-stop through every one... And unlike in the earlier movie these songs actually use Dahl's original lyrics.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The effects. As you'd expect from Tim Burton, the film is a weird and wonderful visual feast. A perfect match for Dahl's quirky ideas.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Depp. As ever, a masterful performance. Even more deranged than the book version, but an interesting take on the character.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The story. Except for some slightly unnecessary diversions into Wonka's past, it by and large it follows the book, which is a good thing.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The kids. Each and every one is a perfect stereotype.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The Oompa-Loompas.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The 2001: A space Odyssey references (and other movie references, e.g. Depp with the scissors in the beginning).</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Just about everything else...</li></ul><br/><br/>If I had to pick one other flaw, it would be that the movie takes a little too long to get going in the beginning. But just hang in there, wait for the factory gates to open, and enjoy the ride...<br/><br/>Bring on the Great Glass Elevator!<br/><br/>9/10"

It was goofy and lovable. Overall the whole cast did a great job, but I was mostly impressed with the boy playing Mike Teavee. I hated that brat! He was more annoying than the old Mike Teavee. I wanted to reach through and strangle that little sucker.

But Johnny Depp was great too! I thought that was one of his best acting performances ever! Even though he was really creepy, he was good at being the psycho Willy Wonka.

","I went to see Charlie and the Chocolate Factory this weekend with great expectations. All of my expectations were met and then some. The movie was delightful just like Willy Wonka's candy!! Johnny Depp did an amazing job as Willy Wonka. He was just so funny with his child like humor.<br/><br/>He made my children and I laugh from the moment he was first on screen. For those of you who want to know the difference from Charlie and the Chocolate Factory versus Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory I do have a few things to say. First, I watched Willy Wonka when I was a kid although I did like it and am still a fan of it today, I was always a bit scared during the film. Especially with that tunnel scene!! I was unsure if Tim Burton would bring some of that darkness to Charlie and the Chocolate factory, since he his known for making some dark films. Charlie and the Chocolate Factory was dark in no way and is a great movie for all ages.<br/><br/>Secondly, I always thought Gene Wilder played a mean Willy Wonka up until the end when he offers Charlie the chocolate factory. Johnny Depp as Willy Wonka was just plain funny, as I have already mentioned. In my opinion there was no darkness in Willy Wonka with Johnny playing him. Which I loved and thought made the movie way more enjoyable!! On Charlie and the Chocolate Factory you will learn more about the story and the characters. Plus, you will get to see the Oompa Loompa's of today and their more modern songs. This movie is definitely a must see for everyone. I promise you will not be disappointed!! My kids and I loved it so much we saw it again yesterday. It was just as great the second time around."

","I love what Tim Burton does with the original Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory. I do not feel that Charlie and the Chocolate Factory has done that version any injustice of any kind. This movie is full of laughs and it even has eerie qualities which are a large part of what makes the movie work so well. Johnny Depp's portrayal of Willy Wonka just seemed to be exactly what I was expecting. I was pleased with his makeup as well as the character's tone of voice and attitude.<br/><br/>I was also pleased with the various behaviors given to the children. They were all much more bratty than I had expected them to be and this only added to my sympathy toward Charlie...not to mention, it was amusing! I also liked how each child who won the golden ticket was shown before actually arriving to the factory. This gave me a chance to get to know them and their personal attitudes and this was hilarious to watch.<br/><br/>In a newspaper article, I read that people could somehow make a connection between Johnny Depp's character and Michael Jackson, and he as the actor could understand why people could make this connection. Aside from some resemblance and what seemed to be similar behavioral characteristics, I could honestly expect Michael Jackson's Neverland to be as strange and unique as Willy Wonka's chocolate factory!"

","In watching the 1971 version of Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, you notice two things... A. Wonka is a very mysterious, but secretly mean man. B. You don't know why he is a mysterious and mean man.<br/><br/>Charlie and the Chocolate Factory(2005) I went into this movie thinking it would be an almost exact copy of Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory. I knew from other reviews that it would be very much like the book. To me, this movie fills in the holes that the old one left out. In this version, you find an understanding about the character of Wonka himself. You can see why he built the factory, why he won't trust grown ups, and also why Grandpa Joe seems to know so much about the factory. Depp brings a whole new man in. His character is wacky and strange, Wilder's character is funny and slick. THIS MOVIE IS NOT A REMAKE. It has a complete new story to tell.<br/><br/>Simply put, this movie will keep a smile on your face. The humor Depp brings to the film is absolutely wonderful. Fun to watch, fun to listen....

As someone who never liked the 1971 film, it was so refreshing to see Burton's take on it, and Depp's exceeding SUPERIOR portrayal of the reclusive, strange Wonka. Many have criticized his performance, but those who are criticizing need to understand the source material a little better. Those who have read the book but still didn't appreciate Depp's performance should at least appreciate what he was reaching for. For me, every word out of Wonka's mouth was hilarious, and the special touches and ""inside jokes"" involving Depp and Burton's other films together made it even more enjoyable and worth a repeat viewing.<br/><br/>The sets were gorgeous, and the Danny Elfman score was perfect as well as his adaption of the Oompa Loompa lyrics from the book. In fact, the Oompa Loompas were fantastic.<br/><br/>The only aspect that kept this movie from being 10 stars was the back story with Wonka's father. I thought it slowed the momentum of the film, but not enough to detract from its magic."

","First, I would like to state that one of my all time favorite movies is Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory. I wasn't sure if I was going to enjoy Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, but from reading the early reviews of the fact that it was NOTHING like the first movie, I went in with an open mind. I took my two children (6 and 10) who absolutely loved the movie! My son usually has trouble sitting through movies but had no problem with this one. I loved how this movie gave the background to why Willy Wonka was the man he became by showing scenes from his childhood. The Gene Wilder version was more about the children where this movie was about Willy Wonka and the children. The scenes in the factory were amazing --- even better than the first movie! The only negative thing I would say is I enjoyed the music more in the first movie than this movie.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this movie for everyone.

The cast was a perfect fit and the music was wonderful. I may be a little bias about it(since I live in Denver,CO-One of the lucky golden ticket winners was a resident of Denver, LOL). It warmed my heart from the beginning right to the end. I must say though that since the movie does not in fact have the original scene of 'the bubble room' I was a little disappointed(it's my favorite part of the original), but Burton makes up for it with all the other candy treats to the eyes. I would say this is a MUST SEE for people of all ages!"

Johnny Depp is a PERFECT Willie Wonka...another acting coup for him for sure. His outfit, hair style, wide smile,voice and gestures create a very sympathetic and likable character. He is really a great actor. The other adults and the children also seemed to relish their roles. The costumes were extremely appealing. The set at the chocolate factory colourful, bright and delightful. The musical tunes catchy and fun. The dancing was a treat. Even the hovel/little house where Charlie lives with his loving family ... parents and grandparents, is intriguing with all the tiny, interesting details.

"amyleexevanescencefan","10","3","7","19 July 2005"," Tim Burton & Johnny Depp, need I say more?
","Tim Burton did quite a lovely job with Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. I have to say, I think it was much better than ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory."" This one stuck more to the book, not completely though. Then again, have you ever seen a movie sticking 100% to the book they're based off of? The movie had me quite pleased. The cast was great fitting for each of their roles, the children were perfect for their parts, and acted out exactly how they were supposed to. Johnny Depp's performance as Willy Wonka impressed me. He was very cute, witty, funny, and dorky in a way. He really made the character of Willy Wonka come to life. It was quite different from any of his earlier roles. The movie was hilarious, it had many witty remarks. The Oompa Loompas are.. interesting to watch and are funny in their own way. Willy Wonka's sarcasm is sure to get at least a few laughs from you.This movie had the whole theater laughing. It's a movie that everyone would enjoy, no matter what age. This movie was entertaining and humorous. In addition, they have many references to other movies, which might be fun to try and catch while watching the movie. Well, what else can you expect from Tim Burton(gifted director who has made some of my favorite movies) and Johnny Depp(a talented/lovely actor) All in all, this might have been the best movie so far this year."

","When I went to the movies,I was pretty sure it would be OK,seeing as it's a Tim Burton film. But it stretch my expectations to the limit. The acting was wonderful,the children were brilliant at being rotten,Freddie Highmore was enchanting,the perfect person to play a young dreamer. And Johnny Depp...wow. He managed to capture the whole essence of Willy Wonka without being scary and put a lot of warmth into his character. Deep Roy was brilliant as the Oompa Lumpas,the songs were amazing,as well as the dance numbers,for just one person to do it all. This movie is delightful for everyone and can make even grown adults squeal in excitement over it and is possibly the best movie this summer (or year)."

","""Candy doesn't have to make since, that's why it's candy,"" so says the character Charlie in Tim Burton's (Sleepy Hollow, Big Fish) re-adaptation of Roald Dahl's beloved children's tale, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. So does this, in so many ways, ""quirky"" film, have to make since? Should the interesting, and kind of scary performance by Johnny Depp (Pirates of the Caribbean, Finding Neverland) matter on whether this film is good or not? <br/><br/>Over the past week, critics such as Roger Ebert and Richard Roeper have said that ""this movie has succeeded despite Depp's performance, which should have been the high point of the movie."" Now lets consider the career of Johnny Depp; he started in the 1980's in Wes Cravens' A Nightmare on Elm Street. He considered himself an actor when he got to Oliver Stones' Platoon. Then he received a Golden Globe nomination for his silent-actor portrayal of an outcast in Edward Scissorhands, then to Benny and Joon, for which he received a Golden Globe nomination. Then he had another venture with Tim Burton, and received a Golden Globe nomination and critical acclaim for his work in Ed Wood. Then he stared in Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, portraying one of his favorite authors, the late Hunter S. Thompson. He stared in another film by Tim Burton, Sleepy Hollow, for which he received a Blockbuster Entertainment Award. Then to Blow. And a few years later, he received Academy Award Nominated performances in Pirates of the Caribbean, and Finding Neverland. Now we're off topic, but the point of that was, his entire career is made up of versatility, just in this past half decade, he played a gypsy (Chocolat), a drug lord (Blow), an inspector (From Hell), and a Pirate (Pirates of the Caribbean). So, Johnny Depp did a wonderful job considering he was trying to portray Willy Wonka separately, away from Gene Wilder's performance in the 1971 adaptation. Sure, he reminded us of Michael Jackson mixed with Mr. Rodgers, but it works. In my opinion, that's probably what Depp wanted. He enjoys freaking people out, especially the producers, with his performances. He made it seem like Wonka was a recluse, which he indeed was. I thought this was a wonderful ingredient to Johnny Depp's filmography.<br/><br/>Tim Burton has worked with Johnny Depp three other times, Edward Scissorhands, Ed Wood, Sleepy Hollow, each one a classic. It was a risk to make this film. Many people were hysterical about it, including the original Willy Wonka, Gene Wilder. Tim Burton's main purpose of this movie was to re-adapt the book, not remake the movie. With many new ideas, it is successful. It is visually amazing, with the introduction, to the set decoration, also the incredible score and songs, written by the composer of almost all of Burton's films, Danny Elfman, to the incredible book-to-screen adaptation.<br/><br/>The low point of the movie Freddie Highmore. It's true, sorry to say it. Highmore possibly bought you to tears in 2004's Finding Neverland. For that performance, Johnny Depp was so pleased with it that he recommended him for this film. Freddie doesn't touch the grain of good acting, he was unnatural, and monotone. And he is really bad at showing emotion in this movie (surprising considering his recent film). There is a scene where he is forced to make a decision, that decision results in him being mad at Wonka, and it was an immediate change, nothing leading into it, and it just made people laugh at him, with the look of intimidation and it sent audiences chuckling. So, despite his critical acclaim in Finding Neverland, this performance is not what you wish it could be. Peter Ostrum never did another film after Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, which was out of his own will. It is truly ironic that Highmore himself says that he does not plan to continue acting as an adult.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp and Tim Burton are working together again, in the stop-animation film The Corpse Bride, a cousin to Burton's A Nightmare Before Christmas.<br/><br/>So, does this film have to make since? Many people don't think so, considering the track records of Depp and Burton, but, yes it does. It has to, and it does. Charlie has hilarious acting, good directing, good story, it's all around good, quirky fun! <br/><br/>I've always been told to close with a quote, because someone else already said it, so why try and top it? When asked about his roles being so different than the others, ""I hope so. That's kind of the goal, isn't it? To try something new, each time out of the gate, and, you either make it work or you fail miserably."" Johnny Depp"

","I would recommend this movie for most ages, young and old. Johnny Depp was fascinating as usual and was a wonderful, humorous, and entertaining Willy Wonka. This movie was so much more enjoyable by my family than the previous version. As has come to be expected, Johnny Depp does a splendid Wonka and did a wonderful job in every aspect. His versatility in roles throughout the years has made him one of my favorite actors. Freddie Highmore was as great in this movie as he was in Finding Neverland. While we don't go to the movies much, but are video rental fiends, I'd take my family to see this again. It will definitely be added to our video library when it comes out on video."
"hillcollina","9","3","7","19 July 2005"," Burton and Depp win the Golden Ticket
","Tim Burton and Johnny Depp do it again for me. A great director and actor duo the best since Martin Scorsese and Robert De Niro. Johnny Depp knows how to bring a character to life, if you're looking for someone to play an eccentric character these days then get Johnny, Films such as Ed Wood, Pirates of the Caribbean, Sleepy Hollow and the recent The Libertine all show how much life Johnny puts in to his characters, he plays them Jack Nicholson style, over the top but definitely not pantomime. Tim Burton's visionary is better than ever after the dreadful Planet of the Apes he got back on form with Big Fish but that didn't show how visionary he can be, this is Tim Burton full on reminding me of the Beetle-Juice and Edward Scissorhands (another great Burton-Depp Collaboration) days.<br/><br/>This version definitely ain't no remake, Burton as definitely stayed loyal to the book, you can see this by just looking at the title, no shits that we call Hollywood producers have got their hands on this and changed it to 'Willy Wonka' and as for all the haters of the new version out there, Roald Dahl hated the original thats why he never gave them the rights to make Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator, which no doubt probably would have been titled 'Willy Wonka's Great Glass Elevator'. So if Roald Dahl hated the original so much what does that tell you? so think on before saying a classic has been ruined because for me a classic much loved book was ruined by the Gene Wilder version. I will admit although the Gene Wilder version was a bit of a classic for me, especially the Ooompa Lumpas. I've got to hand it to Tim Burton and Johnny Depp they have won the golden ticket with this version, the script is great and the directing is beautiful, and the on screen chemistry between Johnny and Freddie is fantastic, as was it in Finding Neverland, you feel like they're father and son. Definitely a must see 9/10"
"bobsteimle","10","3","7","18 July 2005"," Better than the first movie or the book
","The first movie was very different from the book, but it was still delightful because of Gene Wilder's lovable eccentricity. The songs in the first movie were wonderful, especially the two that Gene Wilder sang himself. It was a good movie, so why the remake?<br/><br/>Tim Burton has outdone himself. This ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" is not only his best work; it is better than the first movie. It's even better than the book. Every change it made from the book was an improvement, and there are several changes, including but not limited to: Shortening of the oompah-loompah songs so they give the same meaning without being so boring, the addition of many witty and comedic comments by Willy Wonka, much more dialog from the bedridden grandparents, and a completely different ending to the story. I won't spoil the new ending, but I'll tell you that I liked it very much, it made me cry, and I feel much better about things in general.<br/><br/>I was always bothered by the first movie because Charlie and his grandpa had stolen the fizzy-lifting drinks and Grandpa Joe wanted to sell the everlasting gob-stopper to Slugworth. In this new version, Charlie Bucket is a true hero, the kind of kid any parent would want his kids to be. If you have children, you need to take them to this movie. The book is also great, but if you read the book to your kids first, they will be both surprised by and delighted with the movie."
"WizardOfGore","9","3","7","18 July 2005"," Just Go See The Movie!!!
","Why oh why do people insist on comparing this movie to the 1971 version? I realize everyone is entitled to their opinion, but why can't this movie just stand on it's own? I am tried of hearing ""You can't help but compare it to the original."" YES YOU CAN! The 1971 version was a fantastic movie, and we all loved it as kids and most of us still love it today, but let's face it folks, it's not a truly great movie! For it's time, the effects were great and the set pieces were all really cool, but the acting was not exactly Oscar worthy! <br/><br/>***SPOILER ALERT - IF YOU HAVE NOT SEEN THE MOVIE, SKIP THIS SECTION*** The only<br/><br/>thing I will say is that I could have done without the backstory about Willy and his father. To me, that's just dumbing down the audience. The screenwriter should have just left Willy as an enigma. We do not need to be told why he is the way he is.<br/><br/>I am glad they left in the scene from the book where Charlie sees the other children as they are leaving the factory at the end.<br/><br/>I also do not care that they changed the Golden Geese to trained squirrles or that they left out the Fizzy Lifting Drinks.<br/><br/>***SPOILERS OVER*** <br/><br/>My advice is to just go see the movie. The sets are amazing and the story is closer to the book than the original version. Of course they changed a few things.<br/><br/>By the way, that's another pet peeve of mine, when people complain that they change things from the book or leave things out. People need to understand that it's incredibly difficult, most times, to be 100% faithful when adapting a book to the screen. When people read a book, they read at their own pace. They put the book down, walk away, re-read certain passages, etc. When you adapt for the screen, you have to pace the movie so that the average person can keep up. Also, you have to trim some stuff or, for the most part, all movies would be 4-6 hours long! Go see this movie and enjoy it on it's own merits. If you don't like it, fine, but don't hate it because it's different than the first one or because it's different from the book."

The characters have all been given more depth - especially Willy Wonka! I won't give any details other than saying that there is some back story that really fleshes him out.<br/><br/>The Oompa Loompas are both a riot and uber creepy - in a totally non-threatening way.<br/><br/>Basically, I would rate this a perfect kids movie for adults! Way to go Mr. Burton!"

Burton and Depp are an unstoppable force as always, and this film only reaffirms the fact that Depp can act. (not that we didn't know that in the first place) As the eccentric Willy Wonka in this film he shines better than he has in any other film because this shows the broad spectrum of films he can add his unique talent to.

Johnnie Depp ( although I love him ) seems too young to be Willy and doesn't show enough heart the way Gene Wilder did. Gene Wilders Willy Wonka was strange but lovable , Johnnie is just strange. The sub plot of the children being tempted with stealing the everlasting gob-stopper , by wormsworth (remember that?) as a test that was set up by Willy Wonka to see whom he could trust in the end, is removed and replaced with some Psycho-analytical ending about Willy's relationship with his father ( I don't know if that's how the book originally read but I really wasn't thrilled with it) I say miss the new version and rent the old one.

","I'll admit right here, I am a HUGE Johnny Depp fan, and that was probably the main reason I wanted to see this film. However, I HAVE read the book, and seen the original, and didn't really think the original movie was anything like the book. That was the number two reason I saw this movie, since I heard it was an adaptation of the book. I was also a little hesitant to see it though, because of the rumors that the main character was based on Michael Jackson. But I still went to see this movie, and was blown away. The cinematography in the movie is great, and all the actors do magnificent jobs, especially Freddie Highmore, as Charlie Bucket. He is no doubt adorable, but he doesn't depend on his cuteness to act. He can act. Johnny Depp was great in this movie as well. His take on Willy Wonka is no Captain Jack Sparrow (his best character to date, IMO) but is still memorable and adorable, with a childish demeanor that's too cute. This movie isn't expecting to win Academy Awards (although one for set design would be great), and is all around a fun summer treat."
"SkyDancerDawn","10","3","7","17 July 2005"," Charlie & the Chocolate Factory - not your typical children's movie
","As much as I adore Johnny Depp, I went to see this movie with no expectation of him coming anywhere near the dark comedic genius of Gene Wilder. I have never been more pleased to be wrong! He approached the character at the opposite extreme from Mr. Wilder - volumes spoken in his facial expressions compared to Wilder's deadpan, pratfalls to Wilder's reserve, child-imp to Wilder's wise innocence - yet Depp captured every bit of the essence of the character just as Gene did so many years ago. The casting all around was perfect, but the Oompaloompa(s)!!! Rather than just window dressing as in the first, ""they"" would have stolen the show this time if everyone else hadn't also been so good. And if this wasn't enough, Tim Burton's highly stylized visual effects and all of the movie, musical and television (and political!) references throughout the movie had my daughter and I roaring with laughter during the entire movie. It's been out since Friday here and we've seen it twice... and we caught references we never even saw the first time around. This one is already on my 'must buy' DVD list - but I must warn you - you will either love it for all the reasons above and more, or you will not 'get it' at all. Its one extreme or the other. For me, it was one of the most enjoyable, laugh until my face hurt movies I've seen in years!"

Only the second movie that I have gone to that when the movies ended the crowd applauded. The movies was Funny and keeps you smiling through out the whole movie. I rank it better than the 71 version. Which as a child I watched half a million times. But I don't look at them as the same movie if you know what I mean. Cause the 71 version was loosely based on the book. But I love them both. This movie is just better visually and being closer to the book. Good for a family to go and see but children under the age of 5 might be scared at some scenes. Also was great to hear the Oompa Loompa songs as they are in the book. :)I would totally recommend this movies to children of all ages."
"ohiostepmom","10","3","7","17 July 2005"," Loved it!
","I'll admit I had reservations about this movie at first. Nothing I heard or saw about it did anything but creep me out, and I'm a Depp fan. However, since Pirates, my daughter notices anything with Johnny Depp's picture on it, and asked me to buy a paperback of the book and read it to her. Since I hadn't read it in some 25 years, and was planning to see the movie anyway, I figured what the heck. Wow. What a dark little tale Charlie and the Chocolate Factory really is. I had completely forgotten.<br/><br/>I heard the movie was going to be truer to the book than the 1971 film, which I disliked as a child because I read the book before seeing it. Having reread the book all these years later, I think Burton and Depp nailed it. There is no comparison with the earlier movie. There shouldn't be. This film, including the characterization of Mr. Wonka, must be seen in the context Roald Dahl reveals in his book. Willy Wonka is a recluse, having hidden himself away from society for many years. He has been able to mold his own little world to his liking, without outside interference. Even when he sees a need to invite people back into his factory, he is understandably very wary of them and intolerant of meddling and confrontation. The story is meant to be a moral tale, and this film keeps that feel with more depth than the 1971 film. There are creative bits added to the story in the film, including some symbolism and the back story, but, apologies to Roald Dahl fans, I came away from the movie feeling more fulfilled than I did after finishing the book."

I'm reading all these reviews and I keep seeing people compare this movie to the 1971 version.<br/><br/>It is better to consider this movie an original, rather than a remake. While the story has the same basic principal, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory stays more true to the original book than does the earlier film.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp give a very eccentric performance as the great Willy Wonka. At first you love him, then you hate, well maybe not hate but dislike him, and in the end you love him again.<br/><br/>The scenes were there are many Oompa Loompas leave you amazed know there is only 1 actor playing all of them. Their songs are a little difficult to hear, which is one drawback, but it's great seeing Johnny Depp's reaction to them when they are singing.<br/><br/>Overall I would say the movie is very good and you can definitely tell that Tim Burton was at the wheel of this movie, his style is stamped all over. I would certainly recommend this movie for all those looking for a good time at your local cinema, and remember don't go in looking to compare it to the 1971 adaptation of Roald Dahl's novel."

It seems in todays world of remakes, the original story is lost, or some of the most important plots are forgotten; not here. True to the original, with a hint of originality! In my opinion, if they had cast anyone BUT Johnny Depp in this role, it would have been a waste! His sarcastic comments and facial expressions are most enjoyable and had me laughing through out the movie. I could compare it to Shrek: Created with kids in mind but still VERY enjoyable for adults! My only issue w/the entire move is some of the music that is sung by the oompa's, as sometime the words are hard to understand, but I guess even the chocolate factory needs to get upgrades these days. Great family movie, enjoyed it completely! Great Job, Great Casting, Great visuals, Great fun!!"
"c_p_c","7","3","7","16 July 2005"," Burton cooks up a winner
","I was never doubtful of Burton's capability to pull together this movie. The book's satirical and playful twistedness fits right into Burton's M.O. It is quite evident that Burton had a vision is his mind for this film and for the most part he delivers a fun and satisfying film that serves for great escapism, even though we have seen most of the content before in the original.<br/><br/>While we've heard the story before and know exactly what happens to each character, it is still fun to get a tour of Wonka's factory through Burton's vision. The set crew has crafted some visually astounding sets from the Bucket's home to the colorful factory. Scenes that we will recall from the original, such as the boat ride, are more fun and exciting to watch. The original was very solemn, but here things are pretty fast paced.<br/><br/>With the exception of Depp playing Wonka, all the actors/actresses are duplicating the roles of the characters in the original. Each child plays up their signature bad character trait and Freddie Highmore is perfect as Charlie. Helena Bonham Carter is always a delight in Burton's films and does well here as Charlie's mother. It is Depp's performance that is significantly different from his counterpart. I consider Depp to be one of the best character actors in Hollywood at this time. He adapts well and commits to his characters. However, I found his Wonka at times a bit off. Depp opted to go for the same sarcastic oddity we found with Wilder's Wonka, but he also decided to be more childish and ""punky"" for a lack of better terms. His character is humorous for a bit, but the act gets old after a while. Nevertheless, it by no means ruins the movie and some people will probably really like the character.<br/><br/>Thankfully, the lamentful singing is replaced by the eccentric Oompa Loompa musical numbers. Each number is different and completely funny to watch.<br/><br/>Lastly, what is also fun about this film is that you can see glimpses of Burton's other films on display here. The opening credits, which consist of a tour through Wonka's odd chocolate bar assembly line reminded me a lot of the cookie maker machine in EDWARD SCISSORHANDS. Also, the Bucket's house looks like it was directly lifted out of BIG FISH with its odd slant. Just a few things Burton added in to bring together his style.<br/><br/>In the end, CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY's plot is reused from the original, but what else did you expect. A few things have been changed to follow more closely to the book. While Depp's performance is somewhat off, it certainly is not disastrous to the film in any way. The film is fun, colorful and entertaining. I give it a 7/10."
"frostabby","9","3","7","16 July 2005"," New Charlie is a treat!
","As one who grew up with the original Wonka, I found Burton's rendition to be a treat! Most moviegoers know the fantastic quality of both Roald Dahl and Tim Burton and have a fairly good idea of what to expect, but I never expected to be delighted and entertained in a such a detailed way. Burton and his crew have examined every aspect of the film to make it visually captivating and patent-leather glossed. <br/><br/>Burton pays tribute to Stanley Kubrick's ""2001"" and the original Gene Wilder film in the TV chocolate scene. The usage of Strauss' ""Also Sprach Zarathustra"" did NOT go unnoticed in an excellent homage to the Kubrick film. <br/><br/>I was slightly disappointed by the absence of the Fizzy Lifting Drink scene! I wished Charlie would not be such a little angel - let's give him a chance to be a kid instead of a responsible adult trapped in an eight-year-old body. <br/><br/>Depp's performance as the creepy-eternal-child with a voice from MILWAUKEE was delightful. (I kept thinking Kitty Foreman from That 70's Show) He captured the egocentric, but righteous and just character perfectly. His green-gray face and perfect lip coloring did creep me out, but the purple rubber gloves were a perfect touch. What's with the giant goggles - I kept seeing Elton John somehow. <br/><br/>Thanks Tim and crew for a wonderful take on an old favorite!"

But once we are introduced to Willy Wonka - pandemonium and riotous giggles ensue! Every word that comes from Johnny Depp's perfect Willy Wonka is a gem - guaranteed to make you laugh or your jaw drop. Truly, Johnny's performance MAKES the film.<br/><br/>Freddy Highmore, as Charlie, is pitch perfect. It doesn't hurt that just to look at him makes your heart break. Every time he appears on screen you want to grab him and hug him! But this talented boy plays Charlie as a strong kid who takes what is given him and makes the best of it. He is happy as long as he has his family. Absolutely brilliant!<br/><br/>Deep Roy as the Oompa Loompas was terrific as well. Burton really went the right way with how he portrayed the Oompa Loompas.

Tim Burton and Johnny Depp prove once again to be an amazing team and I now look forward to their next project together.

","This comment contains spoilers, so if you don't want anything spoiled, than just read the second paragraph below. I have just seen this movie, and I was completely speechless! Tim Burton, Danny Elfman and Johnny Depp have collaborated once again. This remake of the classic ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"" is very well done. The special effects are astonishing (effects that could not be done back in 1971), there were a lot of funny lines, and it was also scary at some parts (what else would you expect from Tim Burton). The intro during the opening credits was a little scary, because it didn't give much of a feeling like we were looking at a chocolate factory, but it was kind of cool that we got to see Wonka placing the five golden tickets on five completely random Wonka bars. The Oompa Loompas were also well developed as well as the songs they did. In the original, they sang their song with different lyrics for each rotten little kid, but in this movie, each kid got a completely different song! The way the other four kids were developed was a little disturbing to me. Verucca was sort of the same as she was in the original, but I think she scared me a lot more in the original than she did in this one. In the original, Augustus was dressed formerly, but in this movie, he's dressed like a typical chubby kid; his personality is still the same, though. Violet's a blonde in this movie, and she's also a martial arts champion; in the original, there was no real exploration to what Violet did for a living. Also in the original, Mike was obsessed with TV, but in this one, he's obsessed with video games; also in this movie, Mike is a lot ruder, and he doesn't really talk much about what he's into. Another thing that made this movie different from the original are the parts where Wonka thinks back to his childhood, which kind of made me feel a little sorry for the character. At first, I thought nobody could do Willy Wonka like Gene Wilder, but Johnny Depp did a wonderful job! As for the ending, unlike the original version, we actually get to see what happens to the other kids. Adding on, Tim Burton said that this version was going to follow the book more, so I was kind of fearing that this movie was going to end the way the book ended with Grandpa Joe just saying, ""Yippee!""

","I'll admit it. Before seeing this movie I was nervous. Even during the car ride to the IMAX theater, I was saying, ""I hope this is good...""..And WOW~! This movie has something for EVERYONE! And it is 100% completely appropriate for little children. Since this one stuck much closer to the book I think it will have more to offer for kids. The songs are funny and original (Danny Elfman composed the music, keeping Dahl's original lyrics), Depp shines as the odd candy creator (It's like Gene Wilder said, his performance is indeed magical), and never, NEVER comes off like MJ at ALL. And, despite some comments, the back-story only adds more heart to the movie, giving you a deeper connection with his character, and, it does explain why his is so odd. Not once did I think of the '71 movie. And, sorry for purist fans of that one, but every comment I heard someone make coming out of the theater was about how incredible it was, and how it was even better than the original. The sets are gorgeous, and the little effects they used blended in superbly. The children and the actors who play their parents also shine. Each one is perfectly cast, and really helps to bring the character to life. Freddie Highmore is truly adorable in this movie, and brings more warmth than any character. The script is perfect, there are many funny moments, and the movie itself is wonderfully tongue-in-cheek, never taking itself too seriously. The ending was very touching as well. Every aspect of this movie is incredible. It went above and beyond every expectation I had. If you were having any doubts, please, just go and see it. You will not be disappointed. 10/10"

","Better than the first with an even better cast. Johnny Depp as Willy Wonka, Freddie Highmore as Charlie Bucket and David Kelly as Grandpa Joe. The three actors and their characters were so good together that I really felt a true realness about them. Stunning visuals of the grand chocolate room and the amazing boat ride sequence really started Willy Wonka's grand tour with a bang. One thing I could never have been aware for was the quirky Oompa Loompa songs. Original and yet modern, Danny Elfman is a genius. Along with the casting, all of this really made for a great movie. Hoorah for Tim Burton! It really felt like a Burton film and was done so as to feel like it really was coming out of a story book, which of course, it was. Tim Burton is either a genius or completely nuts but either way, he certainly knows how to put on a show. Go see it! Go see it!"

","I LOVED this movie. I was a little nervous about going because Johnny Depp seemed like a scary Willie Wonka from the commercial and made it look retarded, but I wanted to see it because I was recently in the play 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory' so I now LOVE the story. The movie was hilarious though! I loved how Willie kept having flashbacks from childhood, and finally he says, ""I'm sorry, I was having a flashback."" ""Do these flashbacks happen often?"" Mr. Salt then asks. ""Increasingly... today!"" Willie replies. And the fact that all of the oompa loompas all had the same face! LOL And the robots! Everyone thought they were kinda childish and pointless, except Mrs. Gloop, who was kinda dancing along. And when they exploded, it was so funny! And then Willie pops up by Mr. Salt clapping. And then later with the 'recently added' robot hospital. ROTFL!!!!! The only major thing I didn't like is that the actors/actresses didn't react much. When the kids reached their eliminations, the parents didn't freak out much. In the play we were told to really react. I probably freaked out more in the play for my one part than all four parents combined. I just think they should have been a little more upset, but otherwise it ROCKED!!!"

Of most of us would be a little bit skeptical about this movie because we all grew up with the original and already felt it could not be duplicated. Tim Burton could not have did a better job with this movie. The Cast was perfect. Johnnie Depp was hilarious. He was the best Willy Wonka ever. Tim Burton and Johnnie Depp make a great team as we will see in The Corpse Bride in September. Also, this movie will make you want a gang load of chocolate too.

This was one of the best movies that i have seen in theaters in the last few years and i think Tim Burton just keeps getting more and more creative through the years. And i heard people saying the Johnny Depp looks like Michael Jackson in it and that really upset me because he was warm and funny in it and he didn't mistreat the children in any way that they did not deserve. Also i think the cast worked out really well. Even though some of them were well known they all got into their characters really well and they connected to each other as well.

","Don't listen to the reviews Charlie and the Chocolate was an excellent film, when Tim Burton and Johnny Depp get together they make an excellent film. So what if Willy Wonka is a little weird. A great movie for the kids and adults. This a well shot and planned out movie, and contrary to popular belief it is not a remake. The reviews do not do this movie any justice. Charlie and the Chocolate factory is worth the 8-9 dollars that you will spend on a ticket. The music and set design are flawless, coupled with the comical Oompa Loompa. This version of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory follows the story line that Roald Dahl wrote. Johnny Depp portrays this quirky chocolatier perfectly! This is a must see for movie buffs, Tim Burton fans, Johnny Depp fans, and anybody else who has an imagination."
"matiasr-1","10","3","7","16 July 2005"," Tim Burton has done it again
","All I can say is WOW! This movie is a beautiful work of art and proves to the world that Tim Burton is a crazy genius. The movie exceeded all my expectation. The reason I expected a little less was because the first movie made with Gene Wilder was great and I didn't think it could be done again. But Tim Burton and Johnny Depp(for some reason had a very similar look to Michael Jackson) brought a whole new scene to the movie. Tim Burton's dark imagination and Roald Dahl's bright story brought a contrast that would even keep the Greeks in awe(even though they'd be in awe to begin with since movies weren't in existence back then though hard to believe). Many of you might have though that the Oompa Loompas would ruin the movie. But i must say if it weren't for the Oompa Loompas I wouldn't have had such a good time. Tim Burton's Charlie and the Chocolate Factory movie is pure genius with sarcasm and a humor a four year old would enjoy. I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes Tim Burton, Johnny Depp, and anybody who likes movies. :)"
"laske2","7","3","7","16 July 2005"," Equal to the original classic?
","Johnny Depp is brilliant in this more digital than expected film by Tim Burton. I would say that Depp is the reason that i left the theater feeling good about the movie. His character is nothing like a pirate, a river rat, or opium addict. He changes his voice, and has makeup all over him that wonderfully distort his face, o so slightly.<br/><br/>The movie, as an art piece, is intriguing. It is not as innovative as Citizen Kane or as bizarrely real as the original Batman, but Burton does some wonderfully subtle things. All of the characters who wear glasses are shot in a way so that the glasses make their eyes just a bit bigger. And I think that those subtle things best show Burton's creative, animated side.<br/><br/>But the movie was still lacking in a two areas for me. The sets were too digital for me. I have seen the original Batman so I know that Burton has the ability to distort without using a computer, so I was sad to see all the digital sets. The second issue was the child acting. With the exception of Charlie (Peter from Finding Neverland), the rest of the actors and actresses were just average, and Mike Teevee's character is a disaster.<br/><br/>But all in all this movie is solid, and maybe even excellent when considering that it is a kids movie. The movie is more humorous than the first movie, but it will depend on your devotion to Gene Wilder to decide if you like this one or the original movie. I would sum up the movie by saying that it is as good as a modern day PG movie gets."
"jacksragdoll","10","3","7","16 July 2005"," Wow
","An instant classic. That's what the commercials say. And for once, I have to agree. This movie is absolutely amazing. <br/><br/>Now one thing I want to make very clear is that this is NOT a remake! The older one and this one are completely different. Comparing Depp to Wilder is just ridiculous, because the characters they play are simply nothing alike. The feeling of the movies, the dimensions of the characters, etc., are all different in Willy Wonka and Charlie. Very different. And to be honest, I enjoyed this adaptation much more than the 'original'. <br/><br/>This movie was surprisingly funny, it certainly kept the audience laughing. And it even had that Tim Burton feeling to it that I was afraid it would lack. It's just so weird and funny and emotional, and it was really rather sad at some parts.<br/><br/>What can I say? I love this movie and I definitely recommend it!"
"the_phantom_was_here","10","3","7","15 July 2005"," Another awesome film done by Tim Burton
","This aside from Edward Scissorhands this is my favorite Tim Burton film. I first thought that Burton was trying to remake the classic 1970's version of Willy Wonka and the Chocoalte Factory. I soon discovered that the movie was far from a remake. Butron made Willy Wonka totally something of his own! The movie itself was visually stunning as was the special effects. As for the Oompa Loompas, I thought it would be the only downfall since it was played by one guy. However, as the movie went on and as you see the Oompa Loompas more and more, you eventually accept it. The songs sung by the Oopma Loompas were modern as well as great, proving just how incredible Danny Elfman is as a composer. Something I loved about the film was how Burton added a back story for Willy Wonka which explains more on why he acted in his strange manner through constant flashbacks. It showed his deprived childhood, how he came to the idea of his own strange chocolate making, and how he came across the Oompa Lompas. Another thing I loved was how that not only did the children learn a lesson, Willy himself also learned a lesson towards the end of the movie. This I found to be a twist. I couldn't help but to compare and make predictions based on the original. This movie is certainly worth watching with the family, it has no swearing or violence, which I found to be a surprise. I give it a perfect 10."

But the music in the movie was also way better just because Danny elfman did that and he is a genius as well. I love anything that he puts out for music. I really liked the Edward Scissorhands music. Anything that Tim Burton, Danny Elfman and Johnny Depp work on is going to be great. SO yea I'm eagerly awaiting corpse bride!"

","This movie was the poorest movie I have seen in a very long time. I know some people say ""it was more like the book than the other film"". That may be true. However books are books, and movies are movies. They are too different media and what works well on one does not necessarily work well on the other. I could care less how faithful to the book a movie is. I do not go to see movies for factual correctness. I go to be entertained. This movie was definitely not entertaining. I found myself looking around at the ceiling a great deal. Also, the grossness of people eating massive amounts of candy was overdone. Everyone knows fat people are gross - I don't have to pay $8.50 to understand that. I don't even need the over the top dramatic music either. Johnny Depp just acted like a freak for entire film, but I think its a role he feels most comfortable in. The worst parts of the movie were the Umpalumpa songs. They were embarrassingly bad, and I felt bad for the little Indian man doing them. He must be really hard up for work. This is a horrible flick, and the original is about 85 billion times better."

"azz1596","7","2","4","1 February 2014"," Underrated? Yes. Perfect remake? Ehhh...
","This isn't just one of my favourite remakes, when I was a kid, this was one of my favourite films period. Not only do I think that this is closer to the book than the original, I think that the scenes that were also in Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory are actually even better in this remake, but the film does have its problems. Is Johnny Depp's take on Willy Wonka as annoying as everyone says? Honestly I don't think so, but I can see where people who think it is are coming from. Is Charlie's character as overly perfect as everyone says? I guess but when you get down to it, he was written to be a sort of role model to kids, to show them the right values and morals to have.<br/><br/>One good point to note is that the only scene removed from the original in this remake that is noticeable is Willy Wonka's Death Tunnel (as I like to call it) which, lets be honest, was definitely removed for good reason. Take it from someone who was not that phased by films such as The Shining and Alien that the Death Tunnel scene from the original is scary enough to scar kids for life, and if that was remade in this remake... *shudders at the thought of a new Death Tunnel scene*<br/><br/>I think one reason this film gets quite a lot of hate is because the hate is coming from fans of the original film, but I think that what they don't realise is that this film was not so much a remake of the old film, but more a new film adaption from the book by Roald Dahl drawing little inspiration from the original movie and more from the original source, the book. And considering Roald Dahl actually didn't like the original movie for not being close enough to the book, it was probably for the best.<br/><br/>Overall I'd see this film is definitely a great watch for Roald Dahl fans, but maybe not for die hard fans of Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, and all with less insanely frighting tunnels from hell, meaning no therapy needed after watching this remake!<br/><br/>7/10."

","Who knows why a great artist want to take on such an iconic unique movie? Maybe he wants the challenge. It starts with a dark depressing vision of Charlie Bucket's (Freddie Highmore) poverty. He finds one of five Golden ticket to visit Willy Wonka's (Johnny Depp) chocolate factory. The movie spends too much time in the Bucket home, and takes too long to get to the chocolate factory. Most of the audience already know what's going to happen. The Bucket home should be nothing more than an intro, but it goes on for more than 30 minutes before we take one step into the factory.<br/><br/>Once we get Johnny Depp on screen, the movie gets moving better. I love the Tim Burton vision at his weirdest. Freddie Highmore is certainly a very capable young actor. Johnny Depp adds his own sort of weirdness. I love his weird take on Willy Wonka. On the other hand, I'm not sure about the Oompa Loompas. Mainly, I'm not sure about using the same actor for all Oompa Loompas. I do admit that it makes them even weirder. I would have given this a 7/10, but I have to subtract 1 for the slow start without Johnny Depp."

","This is the story of Charlie Bucket, who lived with his family in a small wooden house on the edge of town. His family consisted of his parents Mr. and Mrs. Bucket, and his grandparents Grandpa Joe, Grandma Josephine, Grandpa George and Grandma Georgina. The family was very poor; Located in the middle of this dull town: the largest, most popular chocolate factory in the world: Wonka's Chocolate Factory. A wonder to behold. Just ask Grandpa Joe, who used to work for Willy Wonka himself! The factory had been closed for years. Nobody went in or out. So, who or perhaps what was helping Willy Wonka in his factory? Grandpa Joe wished he could see inside that factory again.<br/><br/>He and Charlie were about to get their wishes for the very next day, Wonka announced a contest: five golden tickets placed under the wrappers of five ordinary Wonka candy bars. The five lucky people to find them get a tour of Wonka's extraordinary chocolate factory! Well, before long, candy stores all over the world were flooded and Wonka bars were hoarded. The first golden ticket was found in Germany by an overweight, compulsive eater named Augustus Gloop; the second by an English spoiled brat Veruca Salt, the third ticket by a snotty, gum-chewer named Violet Beaureguarde, and the fourth by a television-obsessed monster, Mike Teavee. All seemed lost for poor Charlie, until he found some money buried in the snow and bought a Wonka's Scrumptious Fudge-Mallow Delight. He tore off the wrapper and there was a golden ticket! He raced it home to the family, who were overjoyed. And because Charlie could bring one family member, Grandpa Joe literally jumped at the opportunity. <br/><br/>A huge crowd gathered at the gates of Wonka's factory. The five winners and their parents were invited inside where Wonka put on a little show for them, ala It's A Small World. Willy Wonka was an eccentric, little on the loony side, but a genius nonetheless. He then greeted everybody, not really caring what their names were, but found difficulty in greeting the parents, because Mr. Wonka had a deep, dark affliction with parents dating back to his father, who was a dentist and forbid Willy from eating candy. Unnecessary back-story ahoy! Their first stop on the tour was the nerve center of the factory: the Chocolate Room. Everything was eatable. Augustus was quite fond of the chocolate river, and he took a header right in. It was then that Mr. Wonka's mysterious helpers were revealed: Oompa Loompas, direct from Loompaland. They sang about Augustus' predicament as a giant pipe sucked him from the river. They next board a giant, pink boat and rowed down the chocolate river, through a dark tunnel and finally arrive at their destination: the Inventing Room where many of Wonka's new creative confections were in the works, such as Everlasting Gobstoppers. A particular invention that tickled Violet's fancy was a machine that made a three course meal into a stick of gum. She chewed it and at first it seemed fine, until she got to dessert: blue berry pie. Suddenly Violet turned violet and began bloating out like an enormous hot air balloon. The Oompa Loompas rolled her away to get the juice squeezed out of her; They next come to the Nut Room where some trained squirrels were testing nuts. The bad ones were thrown down a large chute in the center of the room. Veruca had to have one of those squirrels. She went in to get one, but the squirrels deemed her a bad nut and chucked her down the garbage chute. Mr. Salt as well; They next board The Great Glass Elevator takes the remainders to a fascinating room containing Mr. Wonka's other latest work of art: Television Chocolate. It could teleport a large bar of chocolate to through the air waves and broadcast it onto a television set, only this candy wasn't a picture. Mike wanted to try this new invention and the end result really shrank his ego, as well as his entire body! With only Charlie left, Mr. Wonka claims him the winner. A fabulous prize would be in store for him. The three board the Great Glass Elevator again and go...Up and out! They fly over the town and crash right through the roof of Charlie's house, giving the grandparents a rude awakening. They all greet Mr. Wonka, who reveals what the grand prize is: he would turn his factory over to Charlie. The only catch was he had to leave his family. Charlie couldn't do it, so a distraught Wonka left. But, over the course of time Charlie and Wonka met up again, and Charlie was able to get him to make amends with his long lost father. After that, Mr. Wonka wasn't so edgy about the idea of families and offered the prize to Charlie again, this time allowing his whole family to take part in it. Wonka and Charlie became partners, thinking up all kinds of new confectionery wonders and scrumptious delights.<br/><br/>Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. I found it to be a good film... up until Wonka shows up. I feel Johnny Depp was miscast in this movie solely because Tim Burton directed it. Literally hundreds of Hollywood's finest were interested in the role of Wonka, and Burton gave it to his friend Depp who played him like a, well, an eccentric, but also a very out-of-touch, loony...I don't know what the hell Depp was going for here. I would actually recommend the 1971 Gene Wilder version, it was just done so much better. If you like darker visuals and maybe something closer to the visual style, give Burton's a try otherwise. My feelings about this movie have changed from 2005 when I first wrote this analysis. Don't hate it, but am not a huge fan either."

Why so savagely stick a knife through the enchanted, like the street mugging of a saint? How sad this all is. What a disaster of a film, of a concept.

We rarely see him concerned about the welfare of the children when they become at risk, but obviously that is the whole point of the film.<br/><br/>Burton really digs deep with connotations of the seven deadly sins, and all of the main characters (Wonka, and the children) resemble one of the sins, if you can read between the lines.<br/><br/>But don't do that on your first viewing, enjoy the colourful sets and wonderful performances from all involved.

","I realize it was coming from a different place and not supposed to be like the original... but it seemed like Burton wanted to be extra dark and creepy and not 'whimsical' like the original. Yet, Burton's style is generally kind of Gothic-whimsical, so this film was dark, creepy and whimsical but without any actual whimsy. The original is creepy and dark enough because Willy Wonka is not so OBVIOUSLY creepy. It works better if he is kind of unassuming and seemingly harmless.<br/><br/>And the musical numbers? PUH-LEASE. The original Oompa-Loompa song was not dated. It was timeless. Timelessness is what makes movies like this work.

"bdwilner","6","2","4","8 April 2008"," more faithful, but disturbing and dark
","I assign six points because of the quality of the production and the acting: assuming that Johnny Depp set out to achieve what I detail below, then I suppose his performance was phenomenal.<br/><br/>But what he achieved was to portray Willy Wonka as a sadistic gay psychotic.<br/><br/>When Gene Wilder portrayed Wonka in the legendary 1971 production, Wonka came off as eccentric, but we always sensed that he enjoyed children (regardless of his sometimes questionable disposals thereof) and, of course, had a noble heart. In contrast, Depp's Wonka continually disses the children verbally; does everything in his power to convince him that he's disturbed, possibly even a child molester; and engages in strange, STRANGE behaviors.<br/><br/>Why, for example, was it necessary for Wonka to begin the tour with a self-immolating puppet show where puppets burned and melted and showed horribly disfigured faces with eyes melting and popping out? Was it solely to support the extremely weak joke--hours later (if, indeed, the viewer made the connection and ""got"" the joke)--that the ""Puppet Hospital and Burn Center"" was ""relatively new"" to the factory? Also, what was the point of the room where green-suited men sheared pink sheep, to which Wonka said, ""I'd rather not talk about that""? When Wonka revealed that his intention was to give the factory to ""the least rotten"" of the five children, we learned all we needed to know.<br/><br/>When I saw Wonka's adventures begin with Prince Pondicherry and his ill-fated chocolate taj, I was excited by the evident faithfulness to the book, but that excitement was eventually dispelled by the last fifteen minutes of the movie--which had zero to do with the book--embarked on a foolish odyssey whereby Wonka reunited with his estranged dentist father (uncommittedly played by the great Christopher Lee). Wonka was a creep, a weirdo, a sicko, and, overall, just a most unpleasant character, motivating to ask, ""Why on earth would anyone be interested in chasing THIS clod around to obtain his 'secrets'?"" Keep this movie far away from your kids, and watch it only if you're interested in how a shambles can be made of a classic story by offering bizarrely unpleasant interpretations of fondly remembered characters and introducing weak, extraneous material. Further, inexplicable substitutions of characters were made, to wit, Mr. Salt was replaced with Mrs. Salt (very, very weak, as Mr. Salt contributed a strong comic touch to the 1971 production), while Mrs. Teevee was replaced by Mr. Teevee (leaving us with a weakly characterized Milquetoast in place of a truly funny overstressed mom {whom I always thought was Alice Ghostley but, in fact, was not}).<br/><br/>Yecch!"
"departed07","10","2","4","26 March 2008"," Tim Burton and Johnny Depp's return to a classic film.
","In my review of ""Planet of the Apes"" (2001), I wrote that the film was Tim Burton's worst film up to date along with it being the worst remake I have ever seen in theaters where I'm going to admit that I didn't enjoy it very much. However, when I saw the trailer for this remake of the Gene Wilder classic ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory,"" I was amazed to see how amazing it looked before buying the film on DVD in which I got my treats after Halloween in 2005.<br/><br/>""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"", going by the same title as the famous book, is about a poor boy name Charlie (Freddie Highmore) living in a shack house with his parents (Helena Bonham Carter and Noah Taylor) and four grandparents where after his father loses his job because a machine replaced him at the toothpaste factory, they must do things to make ends meet while on in the rest of the world, Willy Wonka (Johnny Depp) has a contest where five tickets are hidden around the world in five separate Wonka bars. The first ticket goes to a fat boy name Augustus in Switzerland; two tickets hit the United States where a karate/bubble gum lover gal and a video game punk addict win the tickets while in England the last two tickets go to a spoil English girl and Charlie.<br/><br/>The five kids along with their adult guardian head to Wonka's factory where if you seen the original movie, there's no reason for me to continue with the summary.<br/><br/>Tim Burton's ""Charlie"" is a gift from the director where he gives more an elaborate on Willy Wonka than just showing him as a goofy man. The performances are outstanding with Freddie Highmore portraying Charlie as a reasonable child who wants nothing more than to be with his family along with Johnny Depp off the Jack Sparrow as Wonka where even though its strange to see Depp playing such a quirky guy, there's nothing stopping the actor. The rest of the great cast include David Kelly as Grandpa Joe, AnnaSophia Robb as Violet, and Deep Roy not playing one, but many of the oompa loompas in this film where he even got paid a million dollar bonus.<br/><br/>10/10"

","Johnny Depp delivers another trade mark 'quirky' performance, but in this movie its thoroughly o.t.t and out of place, and he is given far far too much screen time <br/><br/>the wonder of this story, i.e the chocolate factory, is totally consumed by Depps performance here to the point where the chocolate itself does not even seem desirable. it looks more like Bovril! <br/><br/>on top of this, scenes which worked brilliantly in the 70's version like when Augustus gets sucked up the pipe, seem rubbish here. even more disappointing are the Oompa Loompas, which were so good in the original version. and the Oompa Loompa song in this movie is totally uninspired in comparison <br/><br/>Gene Wilder made for a much better and more mysterious Willy Wonka, whereas Depp seems to do a Michael Jackson impression throughout <br/><br/>given that Burton has come up with inferior versions of at least two great movies now, perhaps it's time to stop trying"

It was so out there. No one can survive in a little house with wholes everywhere. The original, they had a complete house. They went way to far with the remake, I am shocked that Johnny Depp chose this film. It sucks.... All the characters were annoying. Charlie was a small cocky child. The grandpa is a child predator.

","I have always thought to myself when first seeing Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory (1971), ""This movie would be so much better if it were not a musical."" I was instantly intrigued by the movie's storyline and have always thought that the character of Willy Wonka was much darker than he was portrayed. The musical portion of the movie, however, weakened its position on my favorite movies list. I became overjoyed when I heard Tim Burton had signed on to direct the remake and that Johnny Depp would play Willy Wonka because now I knew the dark aspect of the film I had been searching for would finally be brought to life due to Burton's and Depp's collaborations on dark movies in the past. I never realized how much the original movie had changed from Roald Dahl's classic book Charlie and the Chocolate Factory until I saw the remake, which adhered to the book's plot more rigorously. I probably should have read the book before seeing the remake, but the movie seemed to be a sort of ""visual book"" in itself (and it wasn't a musical). I was especially intrigued by Depp's portrayal of Willy Wonka because on the outside he seemed like a quirky, childish weird man, but as the plot progressed, he became darker and more twisted as flashbacks of his childhood revealed he had no family. Burton perfectly showed enough subtle hints throughout the movie to indicate that Willy Wonka may actually be causing the bad things to happen to the children, mostly through little smirks and expressions he would make upon the ""accidents."" The dark aspect and the fact it wasn't a musical made Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (2005) one of the few exceptions where the remake is better than the original."

","As much as I like Johnny Depp, he certainly was not half as great for the part as Gene Wilder was in the original I watched when i was a kid. However I am always ready to check out anything Tim Burton does. Great movie, a modern version of the 1971 film after the book by the infamous Roald Dahl. Charlie Bucket can't believe his luck when he finds a Golden Ticket and wins the chance of a lifetime: a magical day witnessing the miraculous creation of the most delectable eatables ever made. Join Charlie in this irresistible world famous story. There are five children who win the same opportunity to visit nutty Wonka and his far out factory: A greedy boy named Augustus Gloop, spoilt little Veruca Salt, Violet Beauregarde chewing gum annoyingly all day long, Mike Teavee who does nothing but sit in front of the screen watching TV or playing playstation and then there is our hero Charlie from a poor home but loving family. Check out the fabulous Oompa-Loompas, they can be disturbing."

","Stars: Freddie Highmore, Johnny Depp, Helena Bonham Carter, Missi Pyle, Christopher Lee, Deep Roy.<br/><br/>I am a big fan of Tim Burton, so when I heard he was going to do a retelling of the book ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" I was excited. However this film is not as good as it could be. Johnny Depp, who usually gives perfect performances, gives a good performance, but goes over the top too often. As much as I found Depp's performance to be silly, I enjoyed Freddie Highmore's as Charlie. It's not a role that needed a particularly good actor, just one that seems likable, and Highmore pulled it off quite well. As for the movie itself, I felt that there is way too much building up to the Factory, and way too much time after the factory. The kids were only in the factory for less than half of the film, which defeated the purpose of it being called, ""and the Chocolate Factory."" Tim Burton has made worse, but he's also made much better.<br/><br/>My rating: B-. 115 mins. PG for some violence"

"deamond9","10","2","4","11 November 2006"," If you're a fan of the original...
","If you're a huge fan of the Gene Wilder version, you won't like this version. If you liked the book better than the Gene Wilder version, you'll like this version better. If your favorite part of the Gene wilder version was Gene Wilder's insane rant in the tunnel, This is the version for you.<br/><br/>I suppose I might as well start by comparing the characters; (Yes I'm aware that some of the names are misspelled) VIOLET Bureuguard She's a it younger, but if anything even more of a spoiled bitch than she was in the original. Although her demise...<br/><br/>ORGUSTUS GLOOP Pretty much the same as the original, except instead of Ludhiana's he's dressed like Pugsley.<br/><br/>Mike Teavea Mike is an updated version of Mike Teavea. In the book he was obsessed with gangster TV shows and always had guns hanging all around him. In the original it was cowboys, but he still has a gun. In this version he's even more obsessed with violence. He's also a hacker and a video game freak. He also knows allot more about science than Wonka does but, as in all three versions, whenever Mike tries to correct him on something, Wonka accuses him of mumbling.<br/><br/>Violet Bureuguard I thing the writer came across a small problem with the book; an obsession with bubblegum doesn't really tell you much about her. However, in all three version she's a Guinness world record holder. so the writer exaggerated that aspect of her. In this version she and her mother are obsessed with winning and competing.<br/><br/>CHARLIE In all fantasy stories there's always one character who's job is to meet more interesting characters; Luke Skywalker, Frodo, Stanley Tweedle, etc. The funny thing is; in the gene Wilder version, Charlie said he didn't care much for chocolate. Therefore, why would he care about the ticket? This version is closer to the book, in that he's as obsessed with chocolate as Orgustus Gloop, but he's so poor that his family can only afford to give him chocolate once pr year.<br/><br/>GRANDPA JOE Is much closer to the book in this version. He's always telling stories about Mr. William Wonka and he's been bedridden for decades until he sees the golden ticket and shoots out of bed (In the book I imagined this allot quicker, like a gunshots, but it's still way quicker than in the gene Wilder version) Right, this review is probably long enough as it is."
"greenandpinkneon","10","2","4","20 September 2006"," My thoughts on the movie.
","Okay, I voted this movie a ten because I like this version better than the older Charlie and the Chocolate factory. I like it because of the way Johnny Depp portrays Mr. Wonka. He seems more delightfully insane. I like it when he's asked if he constantly gets those flash backs and he says (something to the effects of) ""More and more frequently today."" That was just hilarious to me because I know a lot of people who can relate to that (not just about family). It's nice to see Willy Wonka a little weird and obsessive about his chocolate, because that's how you know it's worth buying.<br/><br/>The things I disagree about this move with is the songs. Like I like the one with Agustus. The one with Violet wasn't that bad, but it's not my favorite. The one with Mike Tevee and Veruca Salt...Oh, that was just like ""Who farted?"" right? I mean the songs make sense but just the way TIm Burton chose the ""video"" for it. Urgh! And why the same guy for oompa loompa's?? I mean, he looks nice and all. But come on! At least the oompa loompa's from the other movie looked the same, but still were different sizes (aka the dressed the small people up the same way but they were still visibly different) compared to the computer generated ones.<br/><br/>These were my only problems, though I still find the movie to be better and a tad bit refreshing (because who wants to watch the same move recreated in a different year?). So I like it."
"mpvorkosigan","9","2","4","23 August 2006"," This is not your father's Willy Wonka. Nowhere near.
","When I heard about this, I thought Depp and Burton had lost their collective mind. After all, the original is a classic. It's a defining moment in Gene Wilder's career. To remake it would be sacrilege.<br/><br/>Burton has passed miracles before, and Depp is a good enough actor that he could do the role justice. ButÂ… no. Can't work, won't work. No way. Dahl's book is a little dark, it might not translate well. And Elfman always does music for Burton, there's no telling what sort of operatic craziness he'll come up with.<br/><br/>Finally I broke down and watched it. Several times. And it's a hoot! Depp's Wonka is sorta clueless. The reason for this is explained early on; after ten years in the candy business, Wonka got tired of being ripped off by his competitors, closed his plant, and fired everybody. A few years later, Wonka reopened, but no one knew who was running it. Supplies came in, product came out, but no workers were ever seen. It went on that way for ten years. And then came the Golden Ticket business, and that's where we come in.<br/><br/>What this version does is cover the backstory, including Wonka's start in the business, his father, the burst of rebellion that made him become a candy maker, Charlie's father and the rest of the Bucket family, and the origin of the Oompa Loompas. They're not the same as the ones in the other film Not midgets in white suits with poufs on their toes and orange skin. There's really only one of them. And through CGI and animatronic trickery that you have to see to believe, they're all played by little man actor Deep Roy, who works harder than any dozen regular-size actors in this. He does intricate choreographed dance numbers, synchronized swimming, acrobatics and gymnastics, and plays all the instruments in two rock bands, one patterned after the Dave Clark Five, the other a cross between Queen and any number of other Eighties hair bands. And he's funny! Deepie doesn't actually talk, and he certainly doesn't sing, but without saying a word he's funny. When he does say something, it's in someone else's voice, usually Danny Elfman's. Danny does all the singing, usually in some massive multi-track overdub harmony.<br/><br/>Willy's dad, Dr. Wilbur Wonka, is a protective, domineering figure essayed by the only man who could do it, Sir Christopher Lee. Chris is a forceful presence under normal conditions, but as Wilbur Wonka, DDS, he's flat unnerving. He loves his son, but won't say so, just tries very hard to show him so, and like most men of that ilk, scares the hell out of his kid. And like most kids, Willy finally takes all he can and leaves.<br/><br/>There are changes in the minor characters. The Beauregardes are now from Atlanta, and instead of Smilin' Sam the used car salesman, we have Sissy or whatever her name is, played by Missi Pyle, possibly the most delectable woman to come out of Memphis in the last twenty years. Violet is now a karate-kicking little girl who's obsessed with winning. Mike Teavee is in the company of his dad, a bland geography teacher. Mike is like the character in the book, only more so; when he first appears, he's sitting on the living room floor, playing some sort of first-person shooter on his Xbox, mowing down bad guys and screaming ""DIE!"" The gaggle of reporters look suitably wigged out. In the book, he likes gangster shows and wears a huge number of toy guns. Here, he doesn't need them; he's scary enough without them.<br/><br/>Veruca is a skinny, fox-faced little Brit whose father looks like the wealthy estate owner he's supposed to be, as opposed to the pudgy, henpecked fellow played by Roy Kinnear in the original. Only Augustus and his mother are almost the same as they were before.<br/><br/>Charlie Bucket and his grandfather Joe are the most changed here. David Kelly's frail Grandpa Joe is far more believable than Jack Albertson was; in places he reminds me of a British Martin Landau, something I think Burton had in mind. Freddie Highmore is a lot more believable than Peter Ostrum; he always struck me as being a little too robust, where this Charlie is frail and underfed. He's also a lot smarter; when he comes home with the Golden Ticket, he tells his family that he's gonna sell it, because they need the money a lot more than they need the chocolate. They won't hear of it. Grandfather George tells him that money is not that big a deal, but this ticket is, there're only five and he might never have this chance again.<br/><br/>Depp as Wonka is a marvel to behold. He's got almost no social skills, having spent the last ten years of his life with nobody but Oompa Loompas to talk to. He wears purple rubber gloves, a pageboy haircut, and reads his responses off cue cards. His skin's an odd bluish-white, he dresses like an Edwardian dandy, and is as odd a duck as you'll see in your lifetime. He's like Michael Jackson without any social skills. Yet for all this, there's something sweet and endearing about him. A lesser actor could not have done this role justice. But Johnny Depp's dysfunctional take on Willy Wonka, man-child chocolatier, is superb.<br/><br/>This movie's worth seeing just on the strength of the set design and Deep Roy. The rest of the performances are really delicious gravy, and make an already cool movie seem even cooler. Burton knocked this one out of the park, and between it and Corpse Bride he has renewed his credentials as one of the greatest filmmakers of his generation. Don't just rent this movie, buy it. You'll want to watch it repeatedly."
"MLDinTN","7","2","4","15 August 2006"," a re-imagination of the book
","This movie was pretty good. But I liked the version with Gene Wilder better. I haven't read the book, so I don't know which version is more accurate. But this movie does have some different adventures in the chocolate factory. Plus, Johnny Depp plays an unique Willy Wonka. He's very weird and neurotic. Plus ghostly(fair skinned): I guess from hardly ever leaving the factory. The stories the same with the finding of the golden tickets. The oomp a loomphas are different and they sing these cute songs every time one of the kids has to go. The boat ride on the chocolate river was different. It was neat. But the other kids beside Charlie were bratty as ever.<br/><br/>FINAL VERDICT: Still a good children's story. I recommend it."
"Flagrant-Baronessa","7","2","4","15 July 2006"," This is what happens when you give Tim Burton free hands
","What happens is, he goes absolutely crazy and spouts out the overblown surreal trip that is Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and it is a total mess. The good news is, it is a rather enjoyable mess and this film is a good example of quirky, but not desperately quirky (Like Garden State, I Heart Huckabees, Broken Flowers, etc). It is a family film but definitely the prototype-film that people of all ages can laugh at and enjoy.<br/><br/>As is the style of director Tim Burton, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is a visual, magical feast that does not look altogether different from the various versions of Alice in Wonderland. The whole atmosphere is kooky and dream-like as is emphasized further by a musical score that sounds like it belongs in a funhouse at a carnival. Some jokes are downright hysterical, but most are just nice and I found that many of the things attempted were mostly met by ""huh... neat."" - type reactions.<br/><br/>Not being a huge Johnny Depp fan like 95% of the world, I did find his performance as the enigmatic Willy Wonka rather enjoyable. How does Charlie and the Chocolate Factory compare to Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory? Quite well, and it appears that Burton sticks closer to the characterizations of Roald Dahl than Mel Stuart did. Pretty good. 7/10"

(But don't worry, its still the basic events from the book.)<br/><br/>Johnny Depp is just creepy in this movie, but also extremely funny. Freddie Highmore is adorable and he and Johnny Depp work great together.

","Now, you may automatically assume that I only say that because I am a fan of Burton and (mainly)Depp's work. Well, I assure you, that is not why.<br/><br/>This film was listed in my favorites the first time I saw it. It's the remake of the strange fiction tale by Roahl Dahl, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. The innocent Charlie Bucket gets to see the wonders inside the massive factory of the successful and mysterious Willy Wonka.<br/><br/>The well portrayed and sometimes creepy characters have Tim Burton written in dark red letters across each beautiful scene. Burton has done an incredible job on this movie, although I do admit it did not expose his talent at best, and it's received most of the recognition it deserves. Each scene displays magnificent areas, most of the ones inside the factory being rather humongous. There is an entire room that is filled with chocolate mountains, another holding the large candy garden, and one where Wonka holds mindless candy firework shows.<br/><br/>The actors did an amazing job as well with their characters. Augustus was large and greedy, and his character was excellently played. Veruca was spoiled rotten by her dad, and you realized it from the moment you heard her speak. Violet was a champion, no arguing with her there. Mike was excellent and represented a better view of how most young boys are these days. Charlie was pure and innocent, you could tell by his sweet eyes and touching voice. Willy Wonka was adorable in his red outfit, and a bit insane after being in the factory for so many years.<br/><br/>Besides Wonka's flashbacks and personal issues with his father, this movie is much more true to the book than was the film Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory. Compared to the first remake of the book, this one represents more of what I saw while I read the book.<br/><br/>The movie gets a rating of 9 out of 10 from me. The one point deduction is for the Oompa Loompas. Deep Roy did a fantastic job on them, but it wasn't what I imagined when I read the book. The Oompa Loompas were supposed to be made up of men, women, and children. They all did not look exactly the same.<br/><br/>It doesn't however ruin the brilliance of the film. If your looking for a great film to show your kids or watch as a family, this is one I highly recommend you give a shot."

It is a darker, funnier version of Charlie and it is much better than the 1971 version.<br/><br/>This version of the famous novel written by visionary author Roald Dahl, has many advantages over the original movie made back in 1971 and directed by Mel Stuart. First of all this version of the classic novel has better special effects. Which isn't a very big surprise considering special effects has come such a long way over the past 30 years. Another thing that is better about this one is there is less singing. Don't get me wrong though. I don't mind a little bit of singing in a movie but the original movie had way too much singing. Another thing better in this version than in the original is the acting. I found the acting in this one quite a bit better than in the original. Especially the child actors. I saw a big improvement in the child actors in this one.<br/><br/>The verdict: This movie is very good. If you've seen the original, then you would love this version.<br/><br/>10/10"

","Charlie and his family live in a dilapidated house, constantly having trouble making ends meet. His father has lost his job and his four grandparents are bed ridden. Charlie's idol is Willy Wonka, the most celebrated chocolate maker in the world. Charlie's Grandpa Joe use to work in Willy Wonka's factory, till Wonka closed it due to the mass theft of his secret recipes. No one has been in Willy Wonka's since he re-opened the factory, till now. Willy Wonka has hidden five golden tickets in five random bars. The five children who find these tickets are given the honor of being able to enter the factory and take the tour of this mysterious place. The five ticket winners; Augustus Gloop, Veruca Salt, Violet Beauregarde, Mike Teavee and Charlie Bucket.<br/><br/>Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is a perfectly suited story for director Tim Burton. Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is a visually amazing take on the Roald Dahl story. There are so many layers and themes present; bonds of family, parents being run by their spoiled children, consumerism, greed, while the film Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory had these themes to, Tim Burton has taken them from a more cynical view, making the satire more tongue in cheek and hits you harder. Willy Wonka isn't such an enigma any more, as we're given a back story to his past, with his over bearing dentist father, stopping Willy from eating chocolate. Also we are given origins to the Oompa Loompas.<br/><br/>Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is more of an update of the story than a remake. Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory took more freedom with the story, while Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is more faithful to the Roald Dahl's book. The films Willy Wonka and Charlie while based on the same story, they are so different from one another, which separates them, as they both can stand on their own merits. The references sprayed around are perfectly done; the reference to 2001: A Space Odessy and Psycho are hilarious.<br/><br/>Tim Burton is such an excellent visual director. The colour pallet is such eye candy, making the film so bright stunning, juxtaposing those darker undertones of the story. Burton can take the visuals to a level where there is so much to take in, yet you aren't overloaded with them. The tunnel ride is a great psychedelic acid trip, as to the room containing the chocolate waterfall and river, and candy trees and plants. There are injections of that dark Gothic feel from Burton's Edward Scizzorhands, which works perfectly here. Johnny Depp is the most versatile actor and is perfect as Willy Wonka. He presents such a creepy Willy Wonka, making him more restrained than eccentric from Gene Wilder's interpretation. Freddie Highmore is such a talented kid, making Charlie sympathetic yet strong, there is such nobility in his performance. The four other child actors; Philip Wiegratz as Augustus Gloop, Julia Winter as Veruca Salt, AnnaSophia Robb as Violet Beauregarde and Jordan Fry as Mike Teavee all in habit there parts, really evoking the ignorance and overly spoiled child. Though his role is minor, Christopher Lee is great as Willy's cynical father.<br/><br/>With so much chocolate to induce hyperglycemia, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is one film to indulge your sweet tooth."
"jazzflute","3","2","4","27 December 2005"," Although truer to the book than the original, Burton's new adaptation lacks the same cinematic cohesiveness as the original.
","Despite a characteristic, mostly enjoyable performance by Johnny Depp as the eccentric and brilliant Willy Wonka, all in all Tim Burton's new adaptation of the original lacks much of what made Willy Wonka & The Chocolate Factory so memorably enchanting.<br/><br/>First, and most egregiously, were the musical interludes so odiously perpetrated by Burton's interpretations of Dahl's mythical ""Oompa-Lumpas."" I literally felt like I was witnessing a performance that of some horrible Broadway showtunes meets vaudeville meets coked out clone army of miniature Peruvians led by a psychotic passive-aggressive guy with an oedipal complex. It was frenetic and strange, in a bad way.<br/><br/>Not only that, but the film seemed so ""chopped up"" according to these interludes that I felt it lost a concrete sense of cohesiveness. I watched it scene-by-scene and was unpleasantly aware of the sharp cutoffs in the midst. I wanted there to be a sense of flow--I wanted the chapters to relate--but instead they seemed patched together piecewise, and without particular thought to smoothing and making transparent the tape holding the patches together.<br/><br/>On the upside, the new film is far truer to the book (which is a wonderful book) and the performances--especially Depp's--are particularly good. That said, I still think Mel Stuart did a better job of casting Charley and Grandpa Joe. Johnny was good enough to compete with Gene Wilder (no small achievement), and the kids are easy enough characters to portray convincingly, but I was less impressed by Charley and Grandpa. They're contrived characters, to be sure, but at least in Mel Stuart's portrayal I wasn't quite as bored and annoyed with Charley.<br/><br/>All-in-all, Willy Wonka & The Chocolate Factory, if less true to the book, was nonetheless far more cohesive as a film. The characters were more convincing, the music was less odious, and in generally the movie retained a ""feel"" that, in my opinion, came far closer to what Dahl was really trying to write about in the first place. The new remake, although appealing with all its Burtonesque visual dazzle, simply doesn't do as entertaining, thought-provoking, or poignant a job of telling the story."
"pogo747","6","2","4","1 November 2005"," eh... mediocre treatment
","Like most of Tim Burton's movies lately, he seems to focus more on style than substance. In Planet of the Apes, the visuals and set designs were absolutely fabulous, but the story was severely lacking. Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is no different. Both Apes and Chocolate are re-interpretations/remakes, but neither of them add anything to the original. In the case of Chocolate, it takes quite a bit away.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp looks absolutely freaky and disturbing. His face and voice are all wrong and reminds me of an amalgam of Michael Jackson, Ziggy Stardust, and Caesar Romero's Joker from the campy old 70's Batman shows... that or a woman who's had 1 plastic surgery procedures too many. The eerie smile and prosthetic teeth make him look like some kind of monster, a far cry from the endearing but eccentric character portrayed by Gene Wilder in the 1971 original.<br/><br/>Ironically, that movie was called Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, it focuses a lot on Charlie and his life of poverty. This one is called Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and focuses too much on the hideous Willy. They bring in the back story of Willy's abusive father in the form of flashbacks, which is completely unnecessary. The kids had a lot of personality in the original movie, but here, they are annoying and cursory. Charlie has no personality and very few lines.<br/><br/>other problems: One segment (2001: Space Odyssey parody) looks like they bought all the left over props from Men in Black II. The new Oompa Loompa songs suck! They are also not cute and don't have any catchy songs anymore. Watching this movie was an ordeal.<br/><br/>""Don't touch that squirrel's nuts!"" -- Willy Wonka. Don't touch this movie either."
"hu14","6","2","4","27 August 2005"," Good, but Visually Overwhelming.
","We all know the story, the sweet little unfortunate boy Charlie (Freddie Highmore) wins a competition along with four other children to visit the mysterious chocolate factory owned by the eccentric and weirdly wonderful candy maker, Willy Wonka (Johnny Depp). What follows is a roller-coaster ride of excitement as the children are taken on a tour of the factory.<br/><br/>From the introduction to the credits the audience is continuously bombarded with nauseating visuals in the form of sets, costumes, designs, special effects and lighting. Each piece in itself is yes, wonderful, creative and fantastical, but we are missing the awe and amazement that the characters feel, which a really good fantasy movie portrays. Burton's overuse of the overpowering visuals after a while cancels out the awe we are meant to feel as we enter each new world in the factory. You feel relatively no connection with either Charlie or Wonka as you are plunged into this story which never gives a breath to develop the characters, and tells the story at a pace so fast that by the end you wonder if you really were sitting there for 2 hours when it felt like 30 minutes.<br/><br/>I really feel that Burton compromises the storytelling side of the film for the visual side of the film, as with his previous films namely Edward Scissorhands and Sleepy Hollow. While the sets and designs are amazing, both the stories and the characters lack depth.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp certainly delivers a weird and wonderful Wonka, and Freddie Highmore is perfectly cast as the quiet and thoughtful Charlie, although he never gets a moment long enough to shine in with the pace of the movie. The child actors all do their bit as the annoying and spoilt little brats, and the parents are suitably moronic. The cast does a very good job with the boundaries that they have in this movie.<br/><br/>The Oompa Loompas however, are another story. Yes, thankfully we no longer see the little people dressed in drag with orange face paint, as in the original movie, but at least those Oompa Loompas had a sense of realness to them, very much unlike the ridiculous clones in the new film. Since each Oompa Loompa is portrayed by the same actor, and is duplicated by a computer, there is no realness to them at all, because you can't see through the visual effects. The beauty of good special effects in movies is when you don't know that they are there, or at least you are temporarily fooled into thinking that what you see is the real thing. When you see these computer copies skipping along with flawless synchronism, you are not being fooled; you know straight away that they are out of a computer, which detaches the viewer emotionally from the story.<br/><br/>Aside from the negatives, this does prove to be an enjoyable popcorn movie for children, and if you take you kids to see this at the cinema, they will probably thoroughly enjoy it. There are plenty of laughs and nearly sickening amounts of colours and of course, chocolate. But for the older viewer, who would like to see a really good movie, and be able to commend the filmmakers for realising Road Dahl's amazing storytelling abilities onto modern film, I'm afraid this will disappoint."

","SPOILERS THROUGHOUT: <br/><br/>It's so nice when you see a remake that is actually good. And Charlie and the Chocolate factory is a winner all around-although it is hard to think of this as a remake as it's so different from the original.<br/><br/>This version is a delightfully engaging, vivid, chocolaty dream. I actually liked Johnny Depp in the role of Willy Wonka, yes he was creepy to be sure, but he was also up to the task and there are only a handful of actors who I think would have fit in the role. (My friend and I went over who else would have been good and came up with Jim Carrey, Robin Williams and oddly enough Hugh Grant to name a few.) Though many have remarked on the similarities to Michael Jackson, and I did indeed see them, they were not nearly as intense as I was lead to believe and Wonka definitely has his own persona, independent of Michael Jackson, Keith Richards, Edward scissor hands or anyone really. Depp puts humor into the role as swell as creepiness and it works.<br/><br/>And the other cast members were exceptional as well, most notably Freddy Highmore as Charlie. The other children were delightfully bratty as ever and it was great to see the oompa loompas again. Special Kudos to the nut cracking squirrels. The movie is very true to the book and the things that were added I thought enhanced the story rather then detracted. It was very well done.<br/><br/>And the special effects-incredible-flowing Chocolate everywhere you turn, flying elevators, sugary streams and glowing iridescent colors everywhere. The Special effects are in a class by themselves and hopefully the movie will win some awards in that department. <br/><br/>All in all Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is an unexpected, delicious surprise. The original is a classic but this is a fine remake and hopefully many children growing up, will see it and fall in love with the story as so many did all those years ago. I really did not expect to like this much, if at all, but it was a delight and oodles of fun all the way through. My vote is a strong 9 of 10."
"artzau","8","2","4","15 July 2005"," Amazing. Simply amazing.
","Roald Dahl was an off-beat writer of children's books. His stories are often dark, a bit wacky and always full of surprises. Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is certainly one of these. I loved Gene Wilder's earlier version but appreciated more for Wilder's performance than for the somewhat ""softer"" texture that they had given the story. Gone was the darkness and the gloom of Charlie's life into the bright sparkling world of Willy Wonka.<br/><br/>Here, Burton, the master of the dark, brings all of the obscure and gray shades of Dahl's work to the screen with an amazing, simply amazing panorama of visual images, colors and thumpy tunes. The cloning of the images of Deep Roy is delightful and adds greatly to the fun of the story. But, the cast really makes it work. Who could play Charlie with that serious waif-look but young Master Freddie Highmore who was so splendid in Neverland, and who else could be Grandpa but veteran character actor David Kelley who delighted us all with his motorcycle ride in the buff in Waking Ned Devine? Then, there's the back-up crew with more character actors like Noah Taylor, James Fox and the wonderful Helen Bonham Carter.<br/><br/>Then, there's Depp. Yes, I would agree with some of the critics, Depp does ""reach"" at times but, hey: read the book. Depp IS Willy Wonka. He adds all the darkness and shadow to the mysterious chocolates. He keeps his goofiness restrained (something Wilder struggled with) and delivers his lines with a stainless steel glitter. Personally, I think Depp is becoming one of our finest actors and this role certainly adds to it.<br/><br/>I loved it. My wife loved it. The kids in the theater loved it. Go see it and judge for yourself."

It is not scary, but has its own unique humor. The humor is brilliant. Johnny Depp brings all his lines alive. People of all ages will love this movie. I like it better than the original. It is also much more different than the original. The characters are great. Johnny Depp pulled off a great new Willy Wonka. I like Gene Wilder's Willy Wonka, but I also love Johnny Depp's Willy Wonka. I actually believe Johnny Depp's Willy Wonka is more realistic. This man has been couped up for 15 years without talking to anyone from outside his factory. He is naturally going to have some communication issues. The whole movie is great and I am going back to see it again. If you can, definitely see it on IMAX."

","If you are a fan of the original, you will probably not like this film that much, but if you view it through the lens of entertainment, visuals and you loved the book and weren't too much of a fan of the original you will love this movie, same goes for me. To start off with, this movie has a magic, beautiful score composed by Danny Elfman, the chocolate makes me starved everytime I watch it. It has amazing visuals, a very strong cast, and unlike some child performances, Highmore was not annoying at all, Johnny Depp of course steals the show as always.<br/><br/>It starts off with Grandpa Joe telling a story of Willy Wonka building a chocolate palace for an Indian, but it melted one day and fell down on top of them. Willy Wonka was facing problems of people stealing his ingredients and the way that he did things so he decided to close down the factory. The story and film is so close to the book that I nerded out in multiple scenes! It was dark and gritty, hilarious, as is always the case with a Tim Burton film, everything about this film made me feel proud (as a Roald Dahl and Tim Burton fan). Wonka decides to sell Wonka bars and only 5 people an get one and there are millions of people all over the world, so it is a bit unfair. Charlie ends up getting the last golden ticket, he runs home and tells his parents and grandparents that he found the final ticket. Grandpa Joe gets up and starts dancing because he is taking Charlie to the chocolate factory to meet the infamous Willy Wonka! Charlie says a lady at the store offered him $500 for the golden ticket and says somebody else would be able to offer more and they needed the money more than they needed the chocolate. His other grandfather, Grandpa George says there are only five golden tickets in the entire world and says money gets printed everyday, implying that going to the chocolate factory would be a one of a kind experience! George says if you don't go you are a dummy for giving up something that will only happen once in his entire life for money, Charlie ends up going with his Grandpa Joe to the marvellous extravaganza.<br/><br/>Before entering the chocolate factory they get a performance from moving dolls singing, Wonka gets introduced to the visitors and says how great the finale of the song was. ""Good morning, starshine! The earth says hello!"" this is when Johnny Depp's brilliant sense of humour comes into the mix. People say he talks a bit too much like Michael Jackson and I am starting to get a bit of it, that does not excuse his tremendously hilarious performance."

"mccallb-55339","10","0","0","13 March 2019"," CATCF Review
","I had first seen this movie when I was just a girl. I remembered how much I loved the movie aesthetic, and the storyline. Yes it was childish and funny, but it was enjoyable in all types of ways. The movie stayed with me throughout my life, junior high, high school. Etc. I would never forget how good the book was after I decided to read it as well. It's great for all ages of course. Kids or adults. The message that it portrays is hidden, but prominent in child development.<br/><br/>On occasion, I have the guilty pleasure of watching it on the weekends. The quality of the film is exceptional, and the actors represent a character that can be felt on a personal level. With this movie, I feel like I could watch it repeatedly, and never get bored. However it doesn't just give a satisfying performance. It touches on the problems with raising the ¨perfect¨ child, and acceptance. Scenes in the move for instance show the problems of not being raised properly, or an overarching theme of forgiveness. With Charlie and The Chocolate Factory, it gives a splendid look into the life of a boy thriving off being the balance in a group of the flawed.<br/><br/>This whimsical film begins with an vision of just how complex the factory is. The process that sends chocolate to cities worldwide is fascinating just as it is mysterious. It then focuses on the main character of the movie, Charlie Bucket, and his family. A quest that is sent by Willy Wonka has people from all around the world looking for a ¨golden ticket¨"" in their candy bars. His yearn for the last golden ticket sent him on a fateful trip to the candy store. Children that discovered the golden tickets popped up fast. From spoiled to unhealthy, the unlikely group of foul children explored the factory, and took away valuable lesson they'd surely remember.<br/><br/>The film touches on how to raise a perfect child. Not unhealthy, spoiled etc. But like Charlie, possess characteristics of a well maintained kid. Near the beginning of the movie, we see the kids who discovered the golden tickets in their Wonka bars. The first kid to find the golden ticket was Augustus Gloop. A laughable line exclaimed from Mrs. Gloop read, ¨We knew Augustus would find the golden ticket. He eats so many candy bars a day that it was not possible for him not to find one!¨ He is clearly not healthy, and is indulging in very bad habits at such an early age. The next kid to ¨find¨ a golden ticket is Veruca Salt. Spoiled by her parents, she gets just about anything she wants. The rich father of Veruca told reporters: ¨soon as my little Veruca told me she had to have one of these golden tickets, I started buying up all the Wonka bars I could lay my hands on.¨ Not only was she just handed a ticket that wasn't even earned, but what she says after receiving the ticket is that she ¨wants another pony.¨ Next in line, headlines blast that Ms Violet Beauregarde has found the 3rd golden ticket. A bratty chewing-gum obsessed bragger is sure to stun the press with her trophies. She states that she is gonna get the special prize ¨because i'm a winner.¨ Not caring about the other kids, she boasts that her cocky attitude will earn her the first place spot. Last but not least, the 4th kid to discover a golden ticket is Mike Teavee (Ironic). Screaming and gunshots heard in the background indicated that this was another prime example of a tech obsessed youngin. When asked how he felt about the taste of the chocolate bar he replied, ¨I dunno, I hate chocolate. Now buzz off, okay? The Sopranos is starting.¨ Good thing he is touring a chocolate factory.
Seeing the lineup of kids touring the factory, it seems as if there isn't one good thing in any of them. Bratty, spoiled, unhealthy,and tech obsessed behavior, are factors of bad parenting that can teach many kids and parents a lesson. It appears that they need the perfect kid to balance out the attitudes.<br/><br/>Another theme hidden beneath the creative storyline is forgiveness. Nearing the final clips of the film, Willy Wonka is conflicted. He recalls to when he was a kid, and was basically abandoned by his father. His father was a dentist that would hammer Willy about consuming any type of sugary food, including chocolate. Willy decided for himself that he would leave in protest, but returned to find nothing. Upon finding where his father had resided, he decided to pay him a visit. When Wilbur (Willy´s father) had first encountered his son, he simply thought that it was a regular visit. Wilbur muttered, ¨Heavens, I haven't seen bicuspids like these since... since.. Willy?¨ They hugged awkwardly afterwards, which they hadn't done in presumably a long time. Willy had been dreading to go visit his father for fear of his reaction, however they hugged as if nothing ever happened all those years ago. This teaches any age that its okay to be scared of trying to mend broken relationships, but it can be reliving to turn the new leaf. Family issues may be solved over time, and it will ultimately be a regret of not fixing dead weight placed upon someone's shoulders.<br/><br/>When I go back and watch this movie, I still get the same happy feeling afterwards, as I did when I was a kid. I don't think parents will rely on a children's movie to inform them on how to parent, but it gives an image of how it should not be done. I can say with certainty that this is still one of my top 5 favorite movies. Not only does it convey inspiring themes, but it just sticks with you. I have seen several movies that made me laugh, and then want to cry, but this movie makes you feel like you are in the shoes of a boy who truly wants nothing more than for love to spread through his family and community."

Maybe the outside world that Charlie lives in is a dark world, but the Chocolate factory could of been so creepy and dark, really play off the color of the chocolate and make it all melty inside-an acid trip gone bad! Maybe even have the cold feel that you got when you saw Vincent Price in the lab in Edward Scissorhands?!?!? Who knows. But I did see it in the movies and I wasn't happy. Too much pressure? Too big of a high hope? Maybe we can use this as a mulligan for Tim Burton, like OK, we won't really count this one? idk..just a thought. I like Johnny Depp movies, fear and loathing..come on! But the way he looked and acted in this one, kind of sucked. It would of been something to see his hair all f'd up like in Edward, and not have those STUPID sunglasses on.

You guys can fight over which movie is better, all u want, I just had to clear a few thins up. And Oompa Loompa's are not orange, that was Mel Stuart's art direction, not Roald Dahl. So stop talking about how they got the color wrong. Its like when a director does a play, they have their own direction of how it should look how it should sound, that's the same with movies, leave Tim Burton alone hes doing a good job.

"stamper","8","0","0","16 September 2005"," Charlie versus Willy
","As of last week I've seen both versions of the famous Roald Dahl book and I must conclude in saying that they both have good bits and bad bits. Let me begin with this film. While I liked the overall cheerful tone of the film, I thought that Willy Wonka (Johnny Depp) who explicitly lacked that cheerfulness was not a very likable character. Johnny Depp's acting was good, but the character he portrayed just didn't fit the bill. Whilst the 1971 version depicted Willy Wonka (Gene Wilder) was a funny and cheerful village idiot, Tim Burton reduced the character to an odd, eccentric and cold individual that I just could not connect with. Regarding the cheerful tone of the story, I liked the approach taken to Willy Wonka in 1971 better.<br/><br/>This film also introduced a back story, not shown in the 1971 version, which is told in flashbacks and which does not add anything of importance to the story. It only takes away some of the mystery surrounding that village idiot who seems to be obsessed with making innovative sweets. Also I do not quite like the way in which Tim Burton introduces those flashbacks and at most times they are more annoying than they are helpful to enjoying the film.<br/><br/>Another annoyance in this film are the Oompa Loompa's. While they were sweet and funny in the original, the amount of songs and on-screen time they have in Tim Burton's film is irritating. It is not because of the acting as such, but the songs they play are very annoying and they take you right out of the enjoyable film experience. You just want them to stop and get back to the story, instead of enjoying what they have to tell you.<br/><br/>What I liked about this film though was the nut-peeling sequence and anything I did not get annoyed by (excluding the massive amount of CGI, which I felt could have been toned down). Nonetheless, I think that despite the (big) flaws, Tim Burton delivers a good film with Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, which makes the fact that there were flaws present bearable on one end of the spectrum and pitiful on the other. Bearable because the rest was so good you kept enjoying it and pitiful because had there been NO flaws, this film could have been one of the best movies ever made. As it is, the film is good, cheerful and enjoyable. Heck, it even left me smiling for minutes after leaving the theater. Still I was not completely satisfied.<br/><br/>7,75 out of 10 (with an 8 given upon voting)"
"JCBar","6","0","0","17 August 2005"," Overall, it was entertaining
","This is an odd movie  Tim Burton of course, so that will be normal  but I'm not sure quite how to rate it. I loved the original movie with Wilder, didn't read the book so I can't comment there; but my daughter did and says this new version is closer to the book, so we'll rest that angle. It really doesn't matter to me if it is or not, but to some it does. And I can honestly say that I was entertained throughout the film. However, some parts are jarring. For a children's movie, or at least one in which a lot of children will be taken to, there are some decidedly adult type comments and situations. The music is not as good as the original, and maybe it was just my theater, but it jumped several decibels whenever it started up. The supporting cast is quite ordinary, and the scenes with Highmore and Depp don't begin to approach the chemistry between the characters in the original film. Moreover, Wonka's back story with Christopher Lee isn't necessary, nor did I find it the least believable due to the ancient look of Lee in all his scenes.<br/><br/>Regardless, I read the mediocre reviews, got dragged to the movies, and generally enjoyed watching it  for the most part. The cute quips from Depp, the best ending with a punctuated and rising '...little girl', still sound humorous. He is of course the best part of the film (leading actors usually are), despite the many comments heard about his Michael Jackson-like appearance and moves, many of which I didn't see or notice. All in all it could have been worse  at least I didn't sit in front of one small toddler who screamed each time the music began, and then just as promptly shut up when it stopped"

Fans of the original will have their complaints about this installment, but for the target audience it should provide lots of fun. Depp makes an amusing but odd Wonka (who bears an uncomfortable resemblance to Michael Jackson), but young Highmore is a true delight as Charlie.

Also, Wonka's father seems to be a character created only to justify the end of the film. But the film has a lot of the magic of Roald's book; the dark side of the trip over the factory, the character of the Oompaa Loompaas are well made and of course, Johnny Depp is great on his role of Willy Wonka. It has the crazy thing of Gene Wilder 70's performance, and a bit of Depp own interpretation. I read somewhere, that Depp found his way doing this role inspired on Stone's musician Brian Jones, particularly his haircut(although Jones was blonde hair)"
"aliasanythingyouwant","Null","0","0","1 August 2005"," Burton's Wonka a Near-Miss
","Most big-ticket summer movies leave one wishing they had been better, and Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is no exception. It doesn't seem to matter how prodigiously imaginative these tent-pole movies are, how accomplished technically - something always happens to prevent them being truly satisfying. To quote the great philosopher Deion Sanders, it must be the money. So much is expended on producing and marketing a film like this, so much rides on the shoulders of such an endeavor, that the people undertaking one are forced inevitably to make decisions based on these economic realities rather than artistic vision - are forced to play it safe. I doubt seriously that Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is, as it stands, the film Tim Burton would've made had he been free to do anything he wanted. <br/><br/>The story takes place in a world of Muswell Hill uniformity penetrated by glimmers of a gently eccentric charm. Young Charlie Bucket lives with his impoverished parents and four bed-ridden grandparents in a little crooked storybook house in the center of an empty lot; Charlie's a radiantly happy kid despite being forced to sleep under a huge hole in the roof, and having to settle for a single candy bar as a birthday present every year. The only ray of hope in Charlie's life is the dream of one day entering Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory, the monstrous industrial-cathedral that towers over the dreary town, visible to his yearning eyes each night as he tries to sleep with the snowflakes blowing into his face. All Charlie needs is to find one of Willy Wonka's five special Golden Tickets, which have been placed in randomly selected Wonka bars and shipped to all corners of the earth. For days Charlie and his family watch the news despondently as bratty, undeserving kids claim the tickets: the gluttonous Augustus Gloop; the spoiled Veruca Salt; the generally overbearing Violet Beauregarde; and the deranged Mike Teavee. It is here that one is forced to engage in a bit of comparative criticism to best make one's point. In the original Willy Wonka, these early scenes were handled with a snide sense of satire, were given full weight by director Mel Stuart and producer David Wolper; Tim Burton, on the other hand, seems to rush through them as if they were nothing but silly business to be dispensed with before getting to the real stuff. There's a slight satiric edge to the portrayal of the bratty kids, the various ways their parents have of ruining them, but the first act overall seems perfunctory, like it was cut together with an eye toward just getting it over with. This is a shame, because it badly hurts the movie. The first Willy Wonka allowed for the slow building of anticipation - just who is Willy Wonka, and what is inside his mysterious factory - but Burton's film is in so much of a hurry to get to the good bits that we're never allowed to really settle-in, to absorb what we're seeing. There are marvelous images - the Buckets' architecturally improbable house; a Taj Mahal made entirely of chocolate - but it all gets to seem like so much wallpaper. I choose to believe that none of this is really Burton's fault, that the studio, concerned about a slow first act, made him cut the movie down. It's a good thing for them, and us, that the movie picks up considerably inside the chocolate factory, and gives us the crazy, kid-bashing kicks we're looking for.<br/><br/>The movie's best asset is its mean-spiritedness. Burton understands that the story is all about cutting vile little children and their equally repugnant parents down a peg, and he does so with the relish of a true sadist. The torture may come disguised as a series of lessons about good behavior, but let's not kid ourselves - the Oompa-Loompas aren't educating us about civility so much as dancing on the graves of the mean, selfish kids. Burton turns these sadistic demises into giddily bizarre musical numbers, the Oompa-Loompas all being portrayed by the same diminutive actor, Deep Roy, who has been digitally multiplied into an entire race of midget worker/moralizers. The chocolate factory on the whole is beautifully rendered; Burton doesn't really depart from the art direction in the first Willy Wonka, but he enhances it. The candy-land set with its chocolate waterfall is classically Burtonesque, the candy-trees twisted into the strange, curling vegetable shapes familiar from Beetlejuice and The Nightmare Before Christmas. Burton may be working from Roald Dahl but the graphic style is all his, as are certain of the movie's underlying themes. For Burton Willy Wonka is a lonely odd-ball, an unloved outcast not much different than Edward Scissorhands, and it's Wonka's return to the world of humans, spurred on by the angelic Charlie Bucket, that provides the film its emotional underpinnings. Johnny Depp brings a sweet/sour goofiness to Wonka, the reluctant ring-master. Young Freddie Highmore stands alongside him as Charlie Bucket, whose moist-eyed purity never lapses into the sugary. There's real heart at the center of the fantasy, but for the fantasy to come fully to life the film needed to take its time. The real lesson of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is this - you can't rush wonderment."

","Charlie And The Chocolate Factory, is based on the book of the same name by Roald Dahl, and was also previously a film in 1971 entitled Willy Wonka And The Chocolate Factory. The film is about Charlie Bucket, a poor boy who lives with his parents and grandparents in a rundown house. Charlie, is fascinated by the town's chocolate factory run by the mysterious Willy Wonka. Nobody has seen him for many years and nobody is ever seen coming or going from the factory and yet his chocolate and candy treats are available all over the world and are very popular. One day it is announced that Willy Wonka, is having a contest where he is putting a golden ticket into five different chocolate bars and the child who receives a golden ticket will get a tour of his factory and a special prize will be given at the end of the tour to one lucky child. Charlie hopes very much that he will get a golden ticket because it is his dream to go into the factory. One day he discovers a golden ticket and along with his grandfather Joe, go along with the five other kids also accompanied by an adult guardian. The first is Augustus Gloop, who is an overweight boy who never stops eating. The second is Violet Beauregarde, who is very competitive and always brags about herself. The third is the spoiled and bratty Veruca Salt, and the fourth is a mouthy boy obsessed with television named Mike Teavee. Willy Wonka, leads them all through his wondrous factory and along the way they discover how bizarre Willy Wonka is himself and of course something unexpected awaits the kids further along in the factory. Charlie And The Chocolate Factory, has good direction, a good script, good performances from everybody involved, good original music, good cinematography, good film editing, good production design, good art direction, good set decoration, good costumes and makeup. As a child I read the book Charlie And The Chocolate Factory by Roald Dahl, and I loved it. Soon after I saw the 1971 movie Willy Wonka And The Chocolate Factory, which I also thought was great and have since seen it a couple of times and have always enjoyed seeing it again. This new version is a great looking film with great sets, art decoration, costumes and makeup and it is visually imaginative and has a lot of neat visual treats that director Tim Burton, is well known for. Besides looking great the film is well acted and despite what some people are saying about Johnny Depp's performance of Willy Wonka being too similar to Michael Jackson, I thought he did a good job. The film was also entertaining and a fun movie that both adults and kids will enjoy. I was however disappointed that a lot of things from the book were changed in this movie whereas I would have liked it to have stayed faithful to the book. I also thought the 1971 film was a lot better because it was more faithful and it was a very charming film. For a reason that will always puzzle me author Roald Dahl, did not like the 1971 film and has since passed on. I'd be curious to know what he would think of this version if he was still alive. This version is good too but I think I liked it more for it's visuals and sets then anything else and in a lot of ways it lacks the magical charm of the first film. I'am still recommending this film and I also recommend the original version and the book as well which is a great book for kids as well as any book by Roald Dahl."

","I was absolutely, unbelievably excited when my friend told me that Charlie and the Chocolate factory was in the making. Then when I saw the preview and realized Tim Burton was directing and Jonny Depp was WIlly Wonka, I could barely contain my excitement. I raced to the movie the first day it began at our theater and was somewhat disappointed, but also pleasantly stunned. Here are the goods and bads:<br/><br/>I loved Depp's portrayal of Willy Wonka, he was charming and charismatic although just like Jim Carrey in The Series of Unfortunate Events, I thought he was a bit too goofy for Wonka.<br/><br/>The set was absolutely amazing, beautiful, and real. I wanted to jump right into the movie at those moments.<br/><br/>The oompa loompa's were very disappointing to me, the did not look as cute and silly as in the 1971 Willy Wonka and the Chocolate factory. I also was not pleased by the songs they sang, they sounded cheesy and seemed like they should have been a joke of the movie on Satuday Night live or something. In the original, the songs was so fun and I still remember the tune after this long.<br/><br/>I liked the beginning and the end the most, it was during the middle that I was a little bit disappointed. <br/><br/>Overall though, I as pleased and tickled by the movie, there were just a few things I would have liked cut out.<br/><br/>Nice Job Depp and Burton!"
"brendab58","7","0","0","17 July 2005"," It was mostly what I expected
","In opening I want to say, that I liked the older version of Willy Wonka, but I also liked this slightly darker version of Willy Wonka, played very well by Johnny Depp. You'll be disappointed if you go expecting Gene's Willy and Johnny's Willy to be the same. They aren't. But, the 5 lucky children who get to tour the marvelous chocolate factory are basically the same as the previous version. The factory is grander and more colorful than the older version,(as it should be), and a little scarier at times than the previous version,(it's a Tim Burton film after all). In spite of all that however, or maybe because of it, it's still an entertaining movie worth seeing,but not for children under 9."
"psu_guy521","8","0","0","17 July 2005"," As Delightful As Chocolate, But It Also Has Its Minor Flaws
","In 1971 Mel Stuart created a film based on a book by the man of the name Roald Dalh. Many people during their youth were forced to read Charlie and the Chocolate Factory in school, for summer reading programs, or a competition. The book contained a very original idea and was a great strive in fantasy, but definitely not a classic book. Stuart in 1971 tried to bring the story to life, creating unforgettable characters and scenes. That film, even with the great Gene Wilder playing Wonka had its flaws. Like the book, it did not seem dark enough to portray its message of how people in the world and children could be ignorant and not care about the important things in life. Also, the film lacked character development. The only character people could really come close to was Charlie. <br/><br/>In 2005 the 1971 movie was updated by the great and very unique film maker Tim Burton. There were things about his remake that were much better than the first film, and then there were areas where he greatly flawed. Burton could had done what neither the book or original movie did, create a fantasy tale that could finally be considered a great classic that would be remembered and revered throughout the ages. <br/><br/>What was good about the movie? The film was darker and more intense in some areas. It did a good job of getting the moral of the story stuck into the audiences' heads. The orchestration by Danny Elfman was amazing (the opening theme was probably one of the best I've heard in a movie). Truly the music was well worth the price of admission. In the movie there was more humor than in the third generated by Depp who played Wonka. Maybe what Burton did best though was not only develop Charlie's character, but he gave the background on Willy Wonka. *SPOILER* Even though it meant taking out scenes that were in the original movie. *SPOILER ENDED*<br/><br/>So what was bad about the film? Depp did do a wonderful job portraying Wonka, but he was too feminine sometimes and did not play the character as well as Gene Wilder. When Depp's Wonka and Wilder's Wonka are compared, the two seem to be two different characters. Also, Burton used too much CGI in the movie. The original seemed much more realistic. Even though Elfman's score was probably the highlight of the movie, there was something in it that was not so great. *SPOILER* Remember the original Ompa-Lumpa songs? They where not in the movie and replaced with more updated versions that were nothing like the originals. What even made it worse was that the Ompa-Lumpas no longer even resembled the originals. That was probably the worst thing that Burton messed around with from the original film.*SPOILER ENDED* The final problem with the film though was its finale. The film never seemed to end, and it seemed Burton tried too much to pound the theme into the audiences head. If he would had cut the film shorter, it would had maybe made the film into a film for the ages. <br/><br/>All in all, Tim Burton's Charlie and the Chocolate Factory was a commendable attempt at creating a classic film. Burton had the right idea of how the film should had been created in 1971, but obviously tried to hard to fix some of the problems that the original contained. It was a better film than the first, but still Roald Dahl's story has yet to be perfected and it may never be in the end."

","What a disappointment! I love the original film with Gene Wilder and had been looking forward to watching this version. I had heard that this was a darker take on the film that was closer to Roald Dahls vision of how it should be. There were many changes to the original - there were many things left out and other bits added / changed which did not enhance the film in any way - and in fact if you had seen the original left you feeling slightly confused If you have not seen the original, or were not a big fan of it, then I guess this may seem like a good film - however if it is a magical fairy story you are after steer clear."
"mpatton1-2","1","3","8","28 July 2005"," Wonka remake a BAD idea
","I am so disappointed with the multitude of missed opportunities that Tim Burton had to elaborate original story lines and make this family classic a fantastical journey for the senses. The lack of creativity and originality is an insult to those of us who enjoy his usual unique and insightful twists. Who would have thought with the range of technology and wealth of creative talent that Hollywood has to offer that a director of his vision could miss the mark by such a wide margin? Speaking as a parent it was vulgar, disturbing and offered inappropriate references for young children in far too many scenes. To add injury to insult, the flat performance coaxed out of Johnny Depp was painful to watch. He has never been my favorite guy, but I feel he has been underrated as an actor and I have no doubt that he and the other good cast members would have been capable of delivering superb acting to help save this film if the dialogue and themes had afforded it. What a sad commentary on our culture that some critics actually recommended this film for families."
"kylagurganus","5","3","8","19 July 2005"," Repulsive! I did not enjoy it : (
","I am in the M.A. program in Children's Literature at Eastern Michigan University. This summer, I am taking a course on children's films. We were assigned to read Roald Dahl's book, watch the 1971 film, and then go to see the new version. We had previously watched Johnny Depp and Freddie Highmore in Finding Neverland (during our study of Peter Pan) and I was expecting another winner from the duo. I couldn't have been more shocked at the nasty tone of ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory!"" I expected to be entertained and seduced by the handsome Depp; instead, I was repulsed! He just got Willy Wonka completely wrong. I think the difference between the old and new film version of ""Charlie"" is that there is little happiness in the 2005 version. Willy Wonka isn't happy, the children aren't happy. There are few genuine smiles. There are no singable songs. No wonder Charlie isn't willing to leave his family at the end; a future with only Willy Wonka would be depressing.<br/><br/>What did Burton get right? The Bucket family! I am glad that Mr. Bucket was incorporated in this film and that the poverty of the Bucket family was well-done. And Freddie Highmore is wonderful as Charlie! He is happy, he is enchanting. I would like to see *him* as Willy Wonka! One last comment: It took me several minutes to decide if, during the chocolate river and candy-covered land area scenes, the actors were live-action or CGI! The skin was so grainy, I couldn't tell. The 1971 had poor production values; it looked cheap. This movie's production values were overdone; it looked fake. And that is unfortunate. I enjoy animation and I enjoy live-action; I just prefer them separately.<br/><br/>I don't see many films each year at the theater and regret paying $6.75 (plus wasting two hours) to see this one. Better luck next time! The Corpse Bride trailer looked promising!"
"Quinoa1984","7","3","8","17 July 2005"," taking it on its own terms, the film is good overall, some great things, some not so great
","It's tempting as a critic to go straight for the easy route a compare/contrast the 1971 Mel Stuart adaptation of Roahl Dahl's classic book of children's fantasy, and the 2005 adaptation by Tim Burton. But I think it would be more beneficial for readers on this site to just discuss the film on its own terms, as best as possible. In the end, I found much of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory to be successful, but with some flaws/personal quips.<br/><br/>On the technical side of the film, it's near flawless- Tim Burton is, indeed, one of only several visionaries working in the mainstream Hollywood system (mostly, I'd guess, out of his movies grossing so much over the years). In the compositions he chooses, in utilizing Alex McDowell's wonderful production design, in giving many of the scenes colors (or lacking in them) to heighten the mood, he has a distinctive style that doesn't seem to loose its energy, even in the less momentous (or overly so) parts of the film. Adding to that is the instantly recognizable music score by Danny Elfman, and the atmosphere is set to a good stance to Dahl's original story.<br/><br/>With the acting side, the performances from the children are faithful to the book's descriptions, in particular Freddie Highmore as Charlie, with a genuine good soul in a sea of spoiled and rotten kids (and parents). All of this is fine, and then comes Johnny Depp as Willy Wonka. If Gene Wilder in the 1971 version made Wonka his own, so does Depp, which is at the least to his credit. At times he can be hysterically funny, in just the little physical actions and facial expressions. He fits the eccentric, slightly off-putting qualities of Wonka well, but at times he also seems a little uncomfortable in the role.<br/><br/>The script by John August gives, un-like in the book where a reader had to fill in the gaps, a back-story of Wonka's childhood and how he became the way he is. But it tries to explain too much, while at the same time not explaining enough. Only towards the end of the film does Depp give Wonka another side to him, and what I was left with was seeing an actor portraying a complex character in what should have been a not-so complex story. While Chistopher Lee in these back-story scenes is dependable as always, it seems a little too much to put on the plate- Depp can play weird well, but he can also play sincere, and the film doesn't give him good room to do his work on one more than the other.<br/><br/>Burton can get brilliant with some of his excesses of the bizarre, but this time it becomes a little much. The Oompa Loompas, the strange little people who populate Wonka's factory, working for their beloved cocoa beans, are all clones in this film (I'm not sure that was how it was in the book, which is fine), and give elaborate, over-the-top, impromptu musical numbers following each of the children's demises (i.e. Augustus Gloop loving chocolate too much, Violet with the gum, et all). It wasn't so much of the portrayal of the oompa loompas that I thought didn't work- I found the scenes involving the Oompa's back-story in the jungle to be very funny- but they tend to be strange just for the sake of it to the story, and the musical numbers are so over-the-top, so inexcusable (in a Monty Python sort of way, not necessarily a bad thing in that context), that it interferes with the rest of the story. The rest of the film is not a musical except for when they appear, which also gives the film a little inconsistency.<br/><br/>So at heart, I was glad that Burton was able to give an interpretation (granted by Burton and the filmmaker's claims it's not a remake of the 71 film) of Dahl's novel that gives room for criticism, as opposed to some of the recent flood of Hollywood remakes and adaptations that make me feel almost indifferent to how bland and average it is. Whatever faults I did have with the film, be it with the script or some of the performances, the pros tended to outweigh the cons, and that a director's imagination, when let loose properly, can make for an entertaining time. Much like with Burton's first film twenty years ago, Pee-Wee's Big Adventure, his films work delights in original ways on kids as well as adults."

This is not the case for Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory. There were Dahl's producing this film as well as going as far to write the lyrics to the songs. It is a film that is dark in a cinematographic way. Not emotionally dark or the such. It is a great film that mixes quotes from the past with the current technology. This is an awesome make of Roald Dahl's novel 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory' for this generation. All those people who are claiming this movie is horrible are nothing more than those who are die-hard lovers of the film 'Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory' and have no place in their hearts or minds to even consider this film anything other than a movie without Orange Oompa Loompas."

There have also been many comments about Johnny Depp's character being ""creepy"" and Michael Jackson-like. You can't read that much into it. Depp is just portraying the fact that Wonka has been in that factory for 15 years, hasn't had much contact with the outside world, as has never grown up. I thought the film was great and I have already seen it twice; something I didn't plan on. Don't judge the movie and make comments about Depp's performance if you haven't seen it yet."
"nyskins1","7","3","8","16 July 2005"," A near-perfect re-adaptation of Roald Dahl's original text
","Tim Burton and Johnny Depp stress it enough, but I'm going to repeat it: ""This movie is not a remake of the Gene Wilder version."" This fact became increasingly evident as the movie progressed, and despite the fact that this movie is completely different from the flawed but wonderful Wilder version, it is close to perfection.<br/><br/>While I said that this movie is not a remake, it is virtually impossible not to compare it to the Wilder version. Special effects have progressed tremendously in the past few decades, and Burton takes advantage of the resources available to him. Burton has an amazing artistic vision, and there is a certain attention to detail that was not quite as present in the version of a few decades ago. Each child is developed almost to the point of absurdity. Even though Violet Beauregard is only in the film for less than 40 minutes, she has the unmistakable identity of the Atlanta child being raised to compete with everyone, and the mother is even better: carefully coiffed, former cheerleader, living through her child. I, as an Atlantan, may appreciate this stereotype more than most, but it is perfect. Augustus Gloop is knocked off even earlier, but his character develops a perfect identity. The Great Glass Elevator is perfect, and the inventing room is simply marvelous. The Oompa-Loompa songs are, if anything, even better than the ones in the older film, and the fact that the Oompa-Loompas are all played by the same person adds to the mystique.<br/><br/>An then there's Johnny. Johnny, Johnny, Johnny. After seeing Johnny Depp as Wonka, it is virtually impossible to picture anyone else (including Gene Wilder) in this role. The fact is, Wilder's interpretation bothered me a bit. Wonka is not supposed to be warm and fuzzy; he's supposed to be eccentric and conniving, and Depp plays this up to perfection. The way Depp plays the part, it is evident that Wonka has not had much contact with the outside world in his life. From consulting notecards to talk about certain parts of his factory to the shy speech inflections he uses, the little eccentricities are what make Depp's Wonka Depp's Wonka.<br/><br/>That said, there are flaws in this version, albeit very few. The chocolate room scene seemed somewhat awkward without Gene Wilder's singing in the background. However, the awkwardness was over in a few seconds, so no damage done. Also, ... actually, there really wasn't anything else.<br/><br/>All in all, ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" is a near-perfect re-adaptation of Roald Dahl's original text. Tim Burton's artistic vision is unmatched, and Johnny Depp's interpretation of the eccentric chocolatier is dead-on. 7/10"

A child growing up in poverty would never leave a family like that behind, he knew that they were his world, and to leave them for a life of loneliness is a life that would be lost.<br/><br/>Overall - a perfect version of the classic book. Not to compete with the original, but to go to levels that the original movie would not have been able to do given the time it was made and the technology behind it back then.<br/><br/>The scene stealing squirrels are fantastic. The only part I missed was the ""fuzzy lifting drink"" from the first movie, but in the end, it wasn't needed here, it would not have made sense with the purity of a child's love of family that is Charlie Bucket!"

","I'm a huge fan of the first movie, and although I expected the best from this, very different version, I was not very happy with what I got.<br/><br/>Without ruining the story, I will say this: this version flips the static/dynamic character structure. Instead of Willy Wonka being the one to emulate, the strong character who impacts Charlie, it's the other way around. Charlie is, in fact, perfect. Too perfect, I thought. It didn't seem very real to me. Meanwhile, Willy Wonka was flawed -- which is not in itself a problem at all -- but his problem, and its solution, came so quickly that it didn't seem very real, to me, either.<br/><br/>As for the good stuff: the visuals were incredible. And incredibly distancing. Many, many things did not make any sense at all. Again, not necessarily a problem, but I felt that it kept many of the universal themes from coming out as strongly as they likely could have.<br/><br/>Another note about the four children: it seems we hear very, very little from them and about them. And there are few factory extras to keep us awestruck. Most of the awe comes from the set designs -- and some very crazy, kooky musical numbers that will have you going, ""Huh?"" I can't call this a bad movie or a badly done movie. Many things are stopping me from making that judgment. It looks spectacular. And Johnny Depp's performance is also totally, totally cool. But I guess, in the end, what it lacked for me was feeling. Something to keep your heart in it. It looked like a lot of plastic to me. Pretty plastic, but just plastic."

","Willy Wonka and the Chocolate factory (the old one) is one of my favorite movies although I am really open to different ""takes"" on books. So when I heard that Tim Burton was re-making Charlie and the Chocolate Factory with Johnny Depp, I was really excited. Then, I saw a few trailers and thought that it was most definitely going to suck. So I didn't set my expectations too high. I went to see it last night.<br/><br/>It was okay.<br/><br/>What I liked: I liked Johnny Depp's Wonka and I felt that his Wonka was more cutesy rather than dark. He was kind of a nut-job who didn't grow up basically and so his ""meaner"" moments were more weirdo, oblivious, and childlike than deliberate,witty, or clever. But I was okay with that, it was funny and he did a good job.<br/><br/>I also liked Deep Roy's Oompa Loompas. The songs were direct lyrics from Dahl and they captured the Oompa Loompa size thing better I think. The songs were great and weird and over the top. (<---this is a good thing) I really liked Freddy Highmore as Charlie. He did an excellent job. However, I think they should have spent more time on Charlie's story and eliminated Wonka's back-story because it feels like they just barely touched on Charlie and jumped right into the factory on this version.<br/><br/>What I thought was OK: I wasn't terribly impressed with the factory. The candy room (the one where everything is edible) was just alright in my opinion. I think they could have used the children's and parent's reactions a lot better like in the old one. In this version they seem more bored than creeped out or amazed. In the old version you really get the sense of awe and wonderment when they first go into the candy room, and I like that. The rest of the factory was OK too. It had Burton's classic feel about it and I liked the squirrel room.<br/><br/>The rest of the children were OK at best. I didn't feel like Veruca was enough of a terrible little brat. I wanted to choke the crap out of her in the old version and I didn't get that feeling in this one. Violet was more beastly than obnoxious in this one. Augustus was pretty good. Mike TeeVee was more of a psycho than obnoxious like the old one. All in all I think the children in the old movie were much better with the exception of Freddie Highmore as Charlie. He did a great job as I mentioned before.<br/><br/>What I disliked (here comes the spoiler): I love Tim Burton and his visuals but I have to say that this movie wasn't anything very new for him (snow, weird buildings, blah blah blah...seen it) and the digital effects looked terrible! I don't understand why nowadays people think that it has to be digital to look good. Why not focus more on the story? It looks so fake and cheesy. The brown water in the old movie and Violet in a big round suit looked better. I was excited going into the movie because I had read or saw and interview with Tim Burton saying that they had shied away from digital effects. They didn't. It looked like crap.<br/><br/>The whole Wonka back-story was un-needed and kind of cute (in a not so good way.) It was completely pointless to give Wonka a back-story. In my opinion, it is better not to know where Wonka comes from. He is more of a mystery that way and that's how I think Wonka should be. I hate how everything nowadays has to be spelled out for audiences. Why do we have to know WHY Wonka is this way? Why can't anything just be left as a mystery? Again, I love Burton but his movies also have an incredible knack for spelling things out to the point where you are beating a dead horse.<br/><br/>I absolutely didn't like...no, HATED that all the children come out in the end. The whole point is that their fate is unknown while Charlie is the only one who comes out unscathed. The audience is to be left wondering whether or not the children got incinerated, chopped up, popped whatever...Once again, everything has to be spelled out. I hate that! And what was up with that ending?!?! Up until the children walked out of that building I was thinking that the movie was pretty good. It was all downhill from there. The way they did the ending was completely unnecessary. Not to mention they beat you over the head with the whole Charlie won't betray his family thing (Yes! we know this already!) They strayed too far from the book and it leaves it completely un-open for the great glass elevator. I hated that they went and saw Wonka's father. ALL of it was completely unnecessary. It hurt the movie and I was disappointed. Instead of leaving the theater feeling all charged and excited, I was sad that they completely butchered the ending.<br/><br/>All in all, the movie was just kind of ""eh."" I'll buy it on DVD but I won't recommend others go rush to see it in the theater."
"veroniqueathena","8","3","8","14 July 2005"," Strange in a good way.
","It was definitely a strange movie. However, I would expect no less from Tim Burton and Johnny Depp. It was not a sugary as the first movie and I liked this one better. I liked it because not only did I like it but so did my four year old. Any movie that can entertain him while keeping my attention is a plus. There were a few moments when I was scratching my head. Willie Wonka makes a few comments that leave you going huh? But I tell you what stole the movie. The ""oompa loom pas"". The songs are redone and are GREAT!!! Ooompa loom-pa RAP and HEAVY METAL. I have to get the soundtrack. Definitely worth paying to watch!! This was one of the better movies I have seen this year."

","Johnny Depp may be the most interesting actor of his generation, and ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" reaffirms that. The story of course has destitute Charlie Bucket (Freddie Highmore) winning a trip to confectioner Willy Wonka's (Johnny Depp) factory. Probably the neatest aspect is how they've reworked Willy Wonka. Due to an overbearing, anti-candy dentist father (Christopher Lee), Willy has resulted a socially awkward wacko who looks like Jim Morrison and Tina Louise had an illegitimate son and occasionally utters aphorisms that may or may not appeal to everyone.<br/><br/>As for the other characters, the Oompa Loompas (Deep Roy) just love to sing about spoiled children getting their comeuppances, and Charlie's grandfather Joe (David Kelly) makes an interesting counterbalance to the young cast. My favorite scene? Gee, that's a tough one. I guess that any one of the other children getting their comeuppances made for something cool: the perpetually obese Augustus Gloop gets sucked into a pipe, the overachieving Violet Beauregarde turns into a blueberry, the spoiled-beyond-repair Veruca Salt gets thrown down a garbage chute by a bunch of squirrels, and the video game-obsessed Mike Teavee gets transferred into a TV.<br/><br/>Anyway, ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" is one movie that's bound to please everyone. Tim Burton really knows how to handle this sort of material."
"tapedeck","1","3","9","6 August 2005"," One of the very worst movies I've ever seen!!!!
","Terrible bloated overdone bomb of a movie. Completely awful soundtrack, mixed horribly with the most obvious electronic harmonization of the Oompa loompas. Danny Elfman is normally okay, but this flat out sucked. Johnny Depp basically is playing Micheal Jackson. Lots of non sequeters in terms of time and space. Compared to the original it's a joke. On its own it's a overblown waste of time and money. There is nothing at all charming about this movie. I'll bet that it will be forgotten in pretty short order. Stay away. FAR AWAY!!!! With the current spate of remakes, this is one that is completely without merit. Not that Walking Tall, or the Dukes of Hazzard are gems, they're not, but this movie. UGH!"
"mdonalds","1","3","9","1 August 2005"," The worst movie ever!!
","Just a dark & dull remake of a great film. A waste of time and talent. We all know the story. And Burton's remake added nothing. It was just like a badly told joke and in an audience of kids it failed get one laugh.<br/><br/>If you love Tim Burton's quirky movies or just love kids movies that are made for adults rather than kids, then you you'd be better off watching Lemony Snicket'sÂ… again. Or just consider holding your breath. The Charlie remake will soon be on cable or at the local video store. It will then join the countless list of forgettable remakes like Flight of the Phoenix.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the funny, witty and endearing original will continue to be bought, rented, watched and loved by kids. Gene Wilder was absolutely right: WHY?<br/><br/>Spoiler: The in-house cinema advertising got more laughs."
"tahirjon6","10","3","9","16 July 2005"," Somewhere Gene Wilder is hiding in shame.
","In 1994 I read Roald Dahls classic tale about a boy named Charlie Bucket and the realization of his wildest dreams.<br/><br/>Roald Dahls book, Charlie & The Chocolate Factory was supposedly made into a major motion picture years ago, starring Gene Wilder as the eccentric and borderline physcotic Willy Wonka. Wilders version was considered a classic by many, including myself... until now!<br/><br/>Wilders version is noticeably weak when stood against this true ADAPTATION (not remake) of Dahls epic tale. Augusts screenplay was pure unmitigated genius, backed up by Burtons strong directing that accurately reflects the tone of the book. And lest we forget the ace ensemble which is also noticeably stronger than the rather mediocre performances of the lesser version. Most of all Depp is excellent at playing a Wonka that is truly as intended by Dahl (a child trapped in a man's body, not a reasonably mature tap dancer) Unlike the Wilder film, CATCF's darkness is complementary to the story, rather than seeming out of place. <br/><br/>Once I was forced to tolerate what seemed like a hasty movie version of a classic book, and now I am able to fully enjoy a true adaptation with a rational ending and a fine effort. This deserves to hold the place as the true tale of Charlie Bucket and Willy Wonka, not the so called ""original."""
"deepestsorrowinside","10","3","9","16 July 2005"," Finally A Movie Straight From The Book
","I think this is the best movie I have seen at all so far. Perfect for anyone to watch. And it sticks to the book better. I hated Gene Wilders portrayed Willy Wonka. And I think that Johnny Deep's was more real and straight out of the book. This is not a remake or an update. This is the original straight from the book. I always like the non conventional approach to movies. I think too many movies are trying to stick within the guidelines and not be different. Difference makes a movie way more interesting to view. And this movie definitely does it. It also lets you get to know more about Willy Wonka than the Gene Wilder version. Basically I would recommend this version to everyone who is particular of movies based off of the books. Because let's face it a lot of people are big on details."
"hooches1","10","3","9","16 July 2005"," ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" is an Excellent Movie!!!
","I have just seen ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" and it ranks in the top 10 of Johnny Depp's performances. He is definitely one of the most versatile actors out there. Never have I seen an actor who can take a character and completely turn himself into it like Depp can. The movie follows the book almost to a tee and Dahl would be very proud of how it turned out. Johnny Depp in my opinion has never made a bad movie and ""Charlie"" should definitely bring him and Tim Burton awards next year. Freddie Highmore was also very good as Charlie. The movie is so different from ""Willie Wonka"" that I would not consider this a remake at all."

The first is Entertainment Value the Second is Artist Value.<br/><br/>Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is a whimsical ride into one of the greatest works of fiction produced by the 20th Century.<br/><br/>My choice for Wonka would have been Jim Carrey, I am glad I did not get what I wanted. Jim Carrey would have been a great Wildereske Wonka, but Depp's Wonka is a head and shoulders above Wilders.<br/><br/>In this movie it seems as though Wonka enjoy's watching each child done in by their foils installed by there parents.<br/><br/>With that said, I rated this movie 10 Stars, 5 Star Entertainment movie 5 Star Work of art!"

","All I can say is I LOVED THIS MOVIE! So true to the original book, but completely its own interpretation! I really think Johnny Depp did a terrific job making Willy Wonka his own character and Freddie Highmore is such a beautiful child, that you cannot help but root for Charlie from the beginning. The factory, the glass elevator, and the pink candy boat were exactly as my mind's eye saw them...almost 27 years ago when I first fell in love with the book. <br/><br/>This was a great feat, and thank you Tim Burton for making such a wonderful, wonder-filled film. The sets, the casting, the timing...impeccable, and to have the original lyrics of the oompah-loompah songs from the book was a great joy. I will never look at Willy Wonka without thinking of this wonderful experience, and it is the genius behind this film that made it so special. God bless you, Johnny Depp, Freddie Highmore, Danny Elfman and Tim Burton...you have made the little girl inside this 36 year old woman very happy indeed."

The Willy Wonka character is just a joke... he acts like he doesn't care about kids, almost as though he's scared of them. Oompa Loompas: I understand this is a remake but they totally butchered the magic of what an Oompa Loompa is. They had a different song for every kid, not even the old Oompa Loompa tune, which would've been a nice treat. They seemed to have added new characters and story lines, and took out some really good stuff. Blah. 6/10. Worth seeing, I guess... but the original is far better."
"lit_man22675","5","3","9","16 July 2005"," A Mediocre Film at Best
","While mildly amusing, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is a mediocre film at best. As a someone who enjoyed the 1971 version of the this beloved children's book, I was very much looking forward to Burton's take on it, and I thought Depp was an inspired choice to play Wonka. Though it has the signature 'Burton look' and quirkiness, Chocolate Factory is perhaps Burton's worst major motion picture, and Depp's portrayal of the famed 'chocolateer' is entertaining, but far from compelling. The 1971 version presents us with a protagonist living in realistic poverty (with the exception of all four grandparents sharing a bed--that seems a bit of a reach) and we can empathize and sympathize with him. Burton's protagonist, while an excellent choice for 'Charlie,' is barred from the same level of sympathy due to the cartoonish portrayal of his poverty--it's simply too ridiculous. Gene Wilder portrays an eccentric genius who hid in his factory because he understood the ways of the world and chose to reject those ways--in other words, he has wisdom and depth. Depp's 'Wonka,' while eccentric, is an obsessive and psychological conflicted genius who seems to have hid himself away because he's a social misfit--no enlightenment, no wisdom, just an inability to cope with the outside world. In short, I was disappointed with Depp's performance. This isn't to say there aren't good points to the film--it looks spectacular, Burton found a great young actor to play Charlie, and there's a bit more character development all around. However, the movie falls short of it's potential. It's worth the time it takes to watch it, but not the nine-plus dollars they're charging at the theaters--wait for the DVD."

","Alright, I know I will get negative feedback on this one, but this movie, to me, was absolutely terrible. I really hate when anyone tries to remake or even come up with their own idea of a classic. Okay, so this one was supposed to be more like the book. Compare the number of people who have read the book to the number of people who watched the 1971 classic, Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory.<br/><br/>I like Johnny Depp. He's an amazing actor who unfortunately agreed to play the role of Willy Wonka the way Tim Burton saw Willy Wonka. But even if he did it the right way, there will never be a Willy Wonka like Gene Wilder. Seriously, he was brilliant in that movie. And the fact that the Willy Wonka in this new film is a cross between Michael Jackson and Prince doesn't help either. It crushed me to watch this movie!<br/><br/>Every little thing about this movie made me increasingly angry. Hey Tim, why don't you remake another classic! How about Planet of the Apes? Oh wait, you already tried that one. By the way, I may be ignorant when it comes to that movie, but has anyone ever figured out what actually happened at the end of that movie. I mean, I have heard a lot of theories but does anyone know exactly what Tim Burton meant? Last I heard it ended like that for the simple reason to have everyone talk about why the ending made no sense. Congrats Tim, you ruined another one.<br/><br/>Anyway, I suggest you go see the film for yourself and come up with your own conclusion. A lot of people may like it, and a lot of people may not like it. All I'm saying is that I loved the first one and I felt that making this one was just a bad idea, and after seeing it, I was right."
"eichelbergersports","6","6","24","13 July 2005"," Burton, Depp try hard, but cannot overcome charm of original film
","You'd have to believe that director Tim Burton has wanted to remake this film for a very long time. Probably from the time he saw ""Willie Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"" starring Gene Wilder back in 1971. But just because someone *wants* to do something, that doesn't always mean they *should* do it. Based on Roald Dahl's classic children's story, that version was one of the best kid's film ever made, so fans of the original are well justified in their apprehension. And while Burton remains more faithful to the letter of the book than the 1971 film, the spirit is weak this time around. It's certainly not because of a lack of effort  the acting, especially Johnny Depp in the lead role and Freddie Highmore (who starred with Depp in the Oscar-nominated ""Finding Neverland"") as the goodhearted, but poverty-stricken Charlie Bucket, is pretty good. The special effects are terrific and the story is compelling. It's just, just  dare I say it  not the same as the first one. I'm sorry to be so elementary here, but that's my problem. It's the same situation with all remakes  most people saw the original first, so they are automatically prejudiced. Wilder, as the eccentric hermit candymaker was sweetly sarcastic and a little touched. Depp, on the other hand (looking like a combination of Michael Jackson and Winona Ryder  with a Beatles' haircut), is just plain creepy. He also goes into weird trances and suffers far too many flashbacks instead of charming the kids like Wilder did, and the subplot of his past family and psychological problems seemed out of place, as well. The child actors are fine, including blonded Annasophia Robb (""Because Of Winn-Dixie"") as athletic, gum-chewing Violet Beauregard; Julia Winter as spoiled Veruca Salt; Philip Wiegratz as tubby Augustus Gloop; and Jordan Fry as the violent video game/television-obsessed egghead, Mike Teavee (just as the original child actors were). But there's still a big piece missing, and that's the music. In the 1971 picture, there were some great tunes, including ""Candy Man,"" ""Pure Imagination"" and ""The Ompa Loompa Song,"" among others. The other songs are removed, and the Ompa Loompas (CGI creations of the same person  Deep Roy - not midgets) sing bad lyrics in three different styles  dance, pop and annoying heavy metal. Burton's direction is always quirky and inventive, and the opening credits are amazing. His small London shanty where the Buckets dwell is also a marvel of art direction, as is his dark, gloomy real world and colorful, fantastic candy factory. Young children and those who have not viewed the 1971 film, will probably like this one more than I did  but that's only because I had the pleasure of seeing the Gene Wilder version first. Poor me, I guess."

","Don't get me wrong. I liked 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory' since I was a kid, but this film won't quite be what I expect from a book movie. There have been great movies based on books. War of the Worlds 1953, the Harry Potter films (the more recent being the best), Lord of the Rings trilogy just to name a few. I think the film will do OK.<br/><br/>There are bright spots in the film. The films accuracy to the book can't be denied. The factory looks spectacular. The cast is right, but there is something a little off in this recipe for book film fame. I have it! Johnny Depp as Willy Wonka. He said in an interview that he imagined a kids show host and a game show host as a single being. He may be a little off on his portrayal. I think he's more like a stoner in an extremely tripped out hallucination's. His performance has a long way to go if he wants to compete with Gene Wilder as Willy Wonka.<br/><br/>This film will do well at the box office, probably take #1 in the first week. I give it 7/10."

","I think that compared to Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, then yeah, this is nothing. Willy Wonka can never be beaten. But let's not think of this as a remake of the movie, but more as a adaptation of the book. It follows the book really well with a subplot thrown here and there so there's a little something we haven't already seen. Everyone says that this movie has no imagination compared to the other movie, but I think it has plenty of imagination! It's Tim freaking Burton! The factory looks like another world (and plus the chocolate river actually looks like chocolate and not colored water)! That, and the children and parents are good actors/actresses as well, they play their parts perfectly. And even though people say Johnny Depp was creepy in this movie, well I would only say his acting was less creepy than his make up and hairdo. Other than that, I didn't think he was that bad. Of course, no one can beat Gene Wilder as Willy Wonka no matter who is acting. But I think a lot of credit goes to Danny Elfman, who did the music for the movie. The actual music (and some songs) in the original is a lot better, but I think that the songs here(mainly the oompah-loompah songs) are better in this movie. They aren't just the same song/tune with a couple lyrics changed. They actually have new tunes and lyrics (that follow the book's lyrics a lot better as well). Sure, the original's were catchy, but these made the other characters they were sung to seem more as individuals and not just the uniform ""bad people"" that we know will get their comeuppance in the end, as in the original the others all got the same song with a couple different lines. Now again, nothing will ever beat the original Willy Wonka, but looking at this movie as just a movie (or adaptation of the book) and not a remake, it's pretty darn good and will probably make you hungry for chocolate by the end of the film..."

","I like the ending, very much indeed! At our local Odeon Cinema we went to see it and, although I though ""oh what a nice ending! You just can't ask for a happier ending!"", in spite of that part, I thought of this film as, if you like, very stale, soggy old sweets (long past its sell-by-date) when compared to the 1971-classic. Now that was a GREAT film and it's just a shame my 7-year-old step-brother (who will be 8 pretty soon) watches it non-stop, all-day, everyday! I'm not stopping him but, you know, it is quite annoying when you see the same film, the same music, the songs, the same actors, the same voices (that get irritating), the same picture, the same narrative, the same settings, the same introduction - OHH! It's VERY annoying but he is only 7 going 8, I suppose so he is still quite young. Perhaps he ain't too keen on the stupidity of this new updated version, either. I wouldn't blame him if he did because this is an hour and fifty minutes of absolutely idiotic dullness. What made Warner Bros. think that them pathetic songs would appeal to anyone, which (more fool them) people did like, especially my sister, Nat. The songs from the original like, ""Pure Imagination"", ""The Candy Man Can"", ""The Oompa Loompa Theme"" and more are classics and the new songs in this 2005-update are simply incompetent in comparison - they're poor, they're rubbish, they're irritating, they're not at all entertaining and worst of all, the acting! OH the acting! I hate it! Johnny Depp looks absolutely ridiculous as Willy Wonka not to mention girlie, he looks like he's a drag queen here and Veruca Salt lacks the attitude of a spoilt, bratty, I-Want-It-Right-Now kind of girl, she seems extremely rational, her voice is very dull, the boat-ride in the factory is totally unexciting, the factory-tour is dull, Grandpa Joe's performance irritates me and if there is any comedy all I can say is that it's unfunny and completely ridiculous. If this is what Roald Dahl would've wanted all this time then for one thing more fool him and for another thing I pity him! What kind of imagination did he have exactly? An unimpressive one by what it sounds! I'm no fan of his published works, to be honest!"
"Jughead_Pwns","1","2","5","20 November 2006"," Disappointing movie
","Tim Burton is my least favourite director. I have never been a fan of him, and I never will, but hey-that's just me. In my vision, all the man does is remind you that you're watching a ""Burton"" movie, rather then just a movie, and for Charlie & The Chocolate Factory; it's excacly that. I remember when I was younger, I loved Gene Wilder's Wonka. It's a classic. the best thing about it was the oompa loompas. Anyways, Looking at the previews I knew this flick wasn't going to be good, but decided to watch it anyway--for my love for the 70's version. How right I was. I felt embarrassed watching this flick. I used to love listening to the oompa loompas sing after one of those spoiled brat kids gets killed, or whatever the heck happens to them. In Burton's version when he made his oompa's (Or should I say Oompa) sing I said ""Do I really have to listen to this crap 4 more times?"". I didn't think Depp put up that good of a performance in this movie, he looks like a Creepy Michael Jackson type character who pauses to much in the film while talking with a little girls voice. It kept having annoying visions of him as a child, which was completely pointless. I give this movie a 1-10. But you know, that's just my opinion on this film."
"jamesb99_1999","1","2","5","3 October 2006"," This was the worst version of a classic I have seen (even worse than The Cat in the Hat)!
","I love virtually everything that Tim Burton does - in fact my favourite film is Nightmare before Xmas.. But this is abysmal.. I loved the original, however wasn't bothered that this tried to be something different.. It just tried way too hard to be different and avoided the charm of the Gene Wilder version. I like Johnny Depp, but this was a miscast (as was everybody in this awful film).. I am also annoyed that Helena Bonnam Carter gets roles in all his films as she's awful!!! Come on, if the only way you can get a role is to sleep and then marry the director there has to be an issue!! I would buy the original and leave this to the £1.99 bargain bin in Walmart... Come on Tim Burton pick up your game, and stop putting that awful Bonham Carter in your films, or teach her how to act!!!"

","After his ""Planet Of The Apes"" 'reimagining', I didn't think Tim Burton could do any worse. Perhaps he might try to redeem himself by taking on smaller, more personal films like he used to. Or at least if he would again tackle larger films, inject them with the same twisted whimsy that made his early films so memorable. Boy was I wrong. The moment ""Charlie And The Chocolate Factory"" started I knew I was in for a soulless, uninspired mountain of drivel. From the heavy oompah-pounding and oh-so eerie choir that Danny Elfman has used ad nauseam, to the moderately quirky visuals that Burton seems to be comfortable with (he must have forgotten the wonderful art direction from ""Beetlejuice"" or ""Edward Scissorhands""), to Johnny Depp's mediocre portrayal of Willy Wonka, everything about this shameful mess was wrong. Was Burton trying to stick close to the book while injecting it with small references to the Mel Stuart film? Maybe he was trying to do the opposite, redoing the film while here and there tucking in a nod to the Roald Dahl book. Whatever he was trying, he failed, miserably. There is none of the charm or lightheartedness from the Mel Stuart version, none of the smart, dark sarcasm from the Roald Dahl story. Instead there was just a flat story, flat acting, and a flat musical score. I didn't care about a single character, least of all Charlie. The subplot of Willy Wonka and his father added nothing at all. In fact, it removed all the mystery from the Wonka character, leaving us with an unfulfilled man-child who had to fill the void of a loveless relationship with a love of candy. Is this supposed to be a moral of some sort? If so, then Tim Burton should follow his own lesson: cramming the screen with creepy giggling and screaming visuals does not make for a reimagined piece of genius. It makes for a flavorless gobstopper that is indeed everlasting."

","I am so glad I didn't go to watch this movie in theaters! This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen! Some of the characters in this movie were incorrect in comparison to the book in the first place. Nearly all of the characters were annoying in their lines. Not only that, they kept saying stuff about the same thing for what felt like forever! And what's with Wilie Wonka saying stuff about cannibalism, and stuff that is incorrect about what chocolate does, etc?!

","I watched this movie on DVD and overall I thought it was a excellent remake of the original, however the ending spoilt it for me. I was intrigued by the first half of the film when the kids were eliminated like the original. I didn't really like the whole thing with Willy Wonka and his father,this bored me a little and I thought that this ruined Ronald Dahl's creation of a classic story, but I thought that Johnny Depp portrayed Willy Wonka very well with the hip new style. Everyone played their parts well. In Ronald Dahl's classic, the four children who visit Willy Wonka's factory are portrayed by the actors very well in the remake. the CGI effects I thought made the modern classic extremely believable, scenery wise. The director Tim Burton ruined the ending of the film because the ending is forced, it seemed as if the producers were forced to think of an ending but ruined it instead of making it better. In my eyes the ending will disappoint you as it disappointed me a great deal because I was looking forward to this classical remake, unfortunately the ending spoilt that. So, I suggest when you decide to see it watch it until Charlie is left and they leave the factory and you see the other children leaving."
"murking","2","2","5","23 December 2005"," Ironic stares and Daddy complexes
","My main beef right off the bat is this___________ ___________________ You know what that is? That's dead space, dead frickin' air. Fill in the blank. You have producers who pay the director to pay actors to ACT! But never mind the whys of why this film is bad. Lets get into the particulars, as yes you must compare it to the 1971 version. It's the same story, the same characters, some of the same dialogue. The overall feel of this film experience is flat and joyless with a hint of perverse smarm. How many times can you put up a lame piece of dialogue for the very talented and charismatic Johnny Depp to read and you get a Milk Dud back and more actors stare back in hipster amazement? These actors, their talent not withstanding do doubt auditioned hard and spent hours in the makeup chair, only to shine for a very brief moment when they get to express their characters'...motivation (?@) But the focus is all on Depp and oh what a wonderfully lovable weird character he's supposed to be. Well, lovable only in Charlie's eyes. Tim Burton is a pretty weird looking guy himself, does he think it's funny when people stare at hi whenever he says something? What if an AD stared at him like a Klingon when asked to adjust a light or get him coffee? He's be fired! The only reasoning for this logic could be the typical projection that goes on between a director and his favorite actor, who represents an idealized version of the director himself. Maybe it's to poke fun at himself, for directors surely need that. To quote Francis Coppola ""I think the film director is one of the last truly dictatorial positions in society today"". And thus it's those guys who truly have tasted success that go on to make films that are truly out of touch with their audience. Maybe you just want to please the mall audiences that will chew and chuck their popcorn and mimic their annoying mirror images on screen ala Mike Teavee and Violet Beauregarde. But I am a film fan and intellectual who writes long rambling online reviews....someone kill me!......and I've seen the original and it's great and want this movie to be good, or at least worthwhile...watchable...anything....<br/><br/>What a waste of time and resources. for every second of irony-stupefecated silence gawking at WW is time that could have been spent exploring the individual characters. Not that I needed to see more about their lives, but they're on the tour, give em a shot to say something witty, something original for Chrissakes. The whole mumbling bit, repeated by Wonka to Teavee is just hostile. The makeup of Violet B. and her mom is is the only improvement from the original I think. Between her and Teavee you truly get an illustration of what the suburbs produce, hackers and fitness gurus, TV junkies and snipey Caucasians. Veruca Salt this time, is ultimately played with some subtlety, but I preferred the manic unrelenting sledgehammer that was the original girl. A rare role for the great James Fox (see Performance, people!) goes largely wasted, as Mr. Salt, for all secondary roles are relegated to gawking and sighing in resignation. ""Am I the only sane person here?"" he thinks. Augustus Gloop is just a joyless,unfortunate and scary sight. You at least feel good for him in the end as he walks out saying he tastes good. At least he has some self-esteem.<br/><br/>The irony spreads, even to Charlie Bucket's family. Kudos to the set designers for making their abode incredibly crappy, that works. The relatives in bed are given some catch-phrases to work with, but they too are not immune to gawking with impunity as the candy-crazed drama plays out. Charlie's parents are the only ones who have an excuse not to overact, or what passes for emoting here. They simply work hard and are too tired for active parenting. BTW it's a surprise to see Helena Bonham Carter here, due to her propensity for breaking up her directors marriages including Burton and Lisa Marie. Yo...how does that happen? and Yo....where's Charlie's paper route? And yo....who blew the budget so wide open they could only afford one Oompah Loompah and simply CG'd the rest. Again, another example of this version's lack of soul.<br/><br/>Now Johnny Depp. He's a fine actor, he's right for the part, but not everything he's capable of can turn around a bad script and a director in a slump. Oh why do directors give in to ironic staring and DADDY COMPLEXES! Every damn movie I see has the main character fighting through endless melancholy from a bad relationship with their father. Actually this one is well realized, the whole thing with Dad Denist Christopher Lee, always welcome, a Burton stalwart. But to have this infect Willy Wonka, in the current context of Michael Jackson-isms lingering too near the surface and too near the children, it's just too damn creepy to even go there.<br/><br/>All in all with the extra details chucked in, it's all tied together rather quickly at the end. You know the Bucket's integrity will never be questioned so you don't need the Fizzy Lifting Drink episode. So the weird Wonka and the bewildered Bucket are in business together. I give 'em 10 years before Charlie wises up, has Wonka committed to an asylum and sells his stock in the company to Mr. Salt. It's just business."

","I thought the movie was quite weird. I at first I did laugh at the oddness of it but after a while it simply got annoying. I thought Willy Wonka was made out to be much meaner and disliking of others in general. I think the first movie was better, the plot line and actors. <br/><br/>I realize that sometimes you can have a movie be a little different and odd, but to me in this movie it goes way to overboard. <br/><br/>I also thought that the part where they blow up the dolls at the beginning was not cool. <br/><br/>Although this is a miner part of the movie, what is up with the pink sheep??

"ezykah","3","2","5","6 September 2005"," Not as good as Willy Wonka- Yet Johnny Depp rocked!
","At first, it was thought that the re-make of the renowned film ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" would be focusing on the highs and lows of the first adaptation of the book by Roald Dahl made in 1971, named ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"" directed by Mel Stuart.<br/><br/>It was said to be a lot darker than the original film, which highlighted that the director was Tim Burton (director of ""Nightmare before Christmas""). This showed that Burton had focused more on the book than Stuart. All the songs were focused on the children and the greed that they had. I found them surprisingly awful, and was expecting more from the film; and then to find out that the lyrics were written by Roald Dahl shocked me! Throughout the first few scenes the narrator tells a dark and deep story about where Charlie lives. The way the story unfolds grabs the audiences' attention, because they want to know what Burton has ""up his sleeve"". It then steams through the main plot; a bunch of repellent and greedy children who are horribly undone by their own character faults, throughout the adventures of the chocolate factory.<br/><br/>The iconography was surprisingly deep. Wonka was portrayed as a dark mysterious man, Johnny Depp played the character of Wonka extremely well; his characteristics and mannerisms were extremely original. Depp's performance was mad and outrageous; what stood out most of all about Depp were his glowing eyes and perfect teeth. Wonka' manic appearance suggests he has been in the factory for many years, with the strange um-pa lumpa men and the haunting memories of his father. Many audiences have come out of the cinema describing Depp by saying how much he is like Michael Jackson; or Jack Nicholson in The Shining.<br/><br/>The camera-work in this film used mainly mid-shots, and often used long distance/wide shots to capture the whole surrounding of the chocolate factory; then long shots were used to watch the characters moving. There were a few High angle shots from the direction of Wonka looking down at the children. Then occasionally throughout the shots of characters moving there were panning movements; or stills.<br/><br/>The editing was fantastic; until it got to the songs; and the digitalised mise-en-scène of the chocolate factory. It didn't seem realistic for the viewer; and this could have been brought across in a better way visually. There wasn't many ""fancy"" editing, but mainly cuts and fades, fade-ins and fade-outs were used for Wonka's childhood memories, and around the screen was a foggy mist surrounding the centered image.<br/><br/>The soundtrack was mainly diegetic. When the filming of the songs were shown; it was obvious the sound was non-diegetic because the dubbing wasn't clear. There was a voice-over at the beginning of the film, with a deep and dark voice, and it was unclear to what the narrator was saying; at the end of the film; we discover that the narrator was one of the um-pa lumpas.<br/><br/>The special effects were hilarious at the end; when the audience finds out what has happened to each greedy little child. The computer-generated images make a great end to the film as the audience laugh harder and harder after they've seen each child.<br/><br/>This film was similar to the storybook, and its suited mode of address aims itself at young children and teenagers aged 8-15. However Depp's performance brings the age category up a level and aims more towards an adult approach, perhaps an audience of 16-30 year olds. So there is a variety of young and old viewers; all different age gaps; and can be enjoyed by all.<br/><br/>Overall the film may have been more like the book, and Roald Dahl may have preferred this version; but I don't think that remaking the film made any justice for the audience."
"debik52","2","2","5","15 August 2005"," Loved the original....hated this....
","This is the worst remake I've ever seen. I love the 1971 version and I love Johnny Depp so maybe I was expecting way too much. The special effects were even better in 1971. Depp's interpretation of Willie Wonka reminded me of Edward Scissorhands without the scissors. The boy who played Charlie was very sweet though. To be honest, I've never read the book, so I don't know which version is more true to the Dahl book. However, the 2005 version doesn't even seem to have an anti-climatic ending I missed the bubble scene with Charlie and Grandpa Joe. Why were the oompa loompas all clones of the same guy? Also, it was never clear what they were singing about the children as they were eliminated. When I saw it today, there were only about 20 people in the theater. It seemed like they couldn't get out of there fast enough when the movie ended. I usually like to read all of the credits before I leave, but I suddenly realized I was all alone."
"thew-3","3","2","5","12 August 2005"," hmmm. very poor indeed.
","Just to put this into context, I am a big fan of the original where Gene Wilder plays the part of Willy Wonka to absolute perfection.<br/><br/>This latest incarnation has sadly been ""Americanized"". Johnny Depp plays a very 1 dimensional Wonka with none of the intricacies and skills of Wilder.<br/><br/>For some strange reason this latest version tries to explain why Wonka is a bit eccentric and peculiar. Why do we need to know? Why does everyone have to have had an unpleasant childhood to explain their quirkiness? Explaining it is like reading the recipe to a meal you are eating - it ruins it and takes away the ""something special"".<br/><br/>Comparing the boat scenes for a moment, the original is moving, scary, thrilling, full of intrigue and panic, and all this with a simple slide show and Wilder's voice over. The new movie has a boat scene full of special effects that is dull dull dull. There is really no comparison.<br/><br/>The ending feels as though the movie was truncated, as though they had run out of time or budget. Wonka just turns around to Charlie at some random point and says ""you are the only one left, you have won"". A real anti-climax.<br/><br/>2 things I liked about the movie were the Bucket's ramshackle house, and the squirrels.<br/><br/>By the way, my 2 young children thought this new version was marvellous. Maybe I'm just old and biased :-)"

Depp was funny in an OCD way, but not enough to carry this joke of a reproduction. The songs were terribly lame.

I almost walked out when I saw that. How can you have ONE Oompa Loompa? I know we have come a long way in digital enhancements but this was just sad and cheap. Someone in Loompaland is rolling over in their grave.<br/><br/>If you love the first one like I did, don't bother spending 9 bucks to see this in the theater.

","What an utter disappointment. Great idea to remake this classic but after that they seemed to have ran out of good ideas. I really like Johnny Depp but his performance was disturbing at best. I never read the book but the musical seemed to understand the elements needed to carry a story. Gene Wilder knew how to portray this character as a bit of an eccentric and a lovable dreamer without you getting the creepy feeling. Depp seemed mentally disturbed and ready for a psychotic break (Michael Jackson influence can't be denied). Wilder's Wonka was disappointed in the character flaws in the children, Depp's Wonka seems to relish in their failures. The whole storyline with Dr. Wanka was a worthless endeavor. Too bad this movie will make millions before people realize how bad it is. The original (if I remember correctly) was not a box office success and has become a classic that has lasted and is beloved by new generations. This movie will be a box-office hit and will be forgotten six months after the DVD comes out. Sorry Johnny but you and Tim Burton blew this one big time."
"Daiquiri2121","5","2","5","19 July 2005"," I was disappointed :-(
","I saw Charlie and the Chocolate factory yesterday in an IMAX theater. I was rather disappointed with the choice of Johnny Depp as Willy Wonka... he didn't give off the same warmth as Gene Wilder. I don't think that a movie such as this should include a Willy Wonka that has psychological problems with his father. I found myself becoming annoyed at Depp at numerous times throughout the movie. In the 1971 movie, Gene Wilder, playing Willy Wonka, did not choose Charlie right off the bat, instead he took time to get to know the children,(tried to be nice) and find out their flaws by how each acted. In contrast, the new Willy Wonka seemed to dislike all the children... he acted very cool to them. To sum it up... Johnny Depp was a less caring, scarier, weirder version of a Willy Wonka, whereas Gene Wilder was kind, caring, and gave off a warmth that even I feel whenever I watch that movie. Another comment I would like to make toward the new movie is that the Ompa Loompas were almost as disappointing as Johnny Depp. True, this movie is more high-tech., and it is funny at some parts... but it can never measure up to the 1971 movie."
"rewster79","5","2","5","17 July 2005"," It's not a remake, it's a new adaptation!
","A lot of people seem to be mistakenly considering this film a remake. It's not a remake. It's an adaptation of Roald Dahl's novel ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"", which happens to be preceded by another (and different) adaptation from 1971 starring Gene Wilder. And, dare I say, it's a much better adaptation. Now, before the hardcore (Wilder's) ""Willy Wonka"" fans burn me at the stake, I will be the first to admit that obviously Tim Burton has the advantage of 30+ years of technological advancements in cinema to insure that he would, at the very least, be able to make a more visually appealing version. But let's face it, there is no film-maker in the history of cinema more naturally suited to tackle this project than Burton. The result is a beautifully, bizarrely stunning film that wreaks of Burton's fantasy/Gothic/Expressionistic style. Johnny Depp's Willy Wonka is powerfully subtle. He's eccentric, he's bizarre, he's even almost cruel... but only to those who deserve it. Depp gives depth to the character in that you can see he's a man with a good heart whom inadvertently has deep issues from which he is too far removed from reality to ever return. He's a man who never really grew up, yet ironically can't connect with today's youth. Burton also owes a lot of credit for the success of this film to Danny Elfman's music. He creates musical sequences for the scene-stealing Oompa Loompas that are just incredibly bizarre and catchy. If you are reluctant to give Burton's adaptation a chance, my advice is to give it a fair shot. Even if you don't agree that this is a superior version, I am confident you will nonetheless enjoy the experience."

"MovieManMenzel","8","2","5","15 July 2005"," Visually Stunning, Entertaining and Dark! Tim Burton & Johnny Depp's version of the classic story by Roald Dahl is a Masterpiece!
","I am going to make my intro short and sweet. I love Tim Burton, he's my favorite director. I love Johnny Depp, he's my favorite actor. Therefore, I was thrilled to see ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" finally when it was released into theaters today 7/15/05. In fact, I drove 45 minutes to see it on the IMAX! <br/><br/>""Charlie and The Chocolate Factory"" is based on the book by Roald Dahl and is the story of Charlie Bucket (Freddie Highmore).Charlie is from a poor family, and one of his biggest dreams is to go inside the Wonka Factory to see this marvelous and one of a kind factory. Willy Wonka (Johnny Depp) however has not allowed anyone in his factory for several years due to the fact that everyone wants to know the Wonka secret. One day, Willy Wonka decides to open the factory to 5 people lucky people who find a golden ticket in his chocolate bars. The lucky ticket finders will not only be able to come visit the factory but also get a year supply of Wonka Bars. And to top it off one person will actually win an extra special reward. So the search begins to find the five Golden Tickets and the magic of ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" begins.<br/><br/>I had high hopes for this film ever since I first heard about it. Now did the film meet my expectation? Absolutely! I loved this film! Loved it! Johnny Depp plays Willy Wonka and plays him perfectly. I loved Depp's vision of Willy Wonka; weird, creepy, and sarcastic. It was terrific. From the moment, Depp appeared on screen, I knew he was going to give a great performance. Freddie Highmore was also terrific in the film. That kid has talent. He was great in ""Finding Neverland"" and is great in the film as well. He is very believable, likable and knows how to act. There are so many other characters in this film and it would take forever to list but they were all wonderful as well. Bottom line, this movie has a great cast and everyone plays their roles perfectly.<br/><br/>Tim Burton is back in his top form. I am a huge Tim Burton fan, probably one of his biggest fans and I have to say this film is right up there with ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"", ""Ed Wood"", and Edward Scissorhands."" It's been a while since I have seen Tim Burton at his best but this is probably his best film since ""Ed Wood."" Don't get me wrong; I liked all of Burton's movies since ""Ed Wood"" but just not as much as the three I just mentioned.<br/><br/>Tim Burton uses such imagination when he makes movies plus the guy knows how to create a visually stunning movie. This movie especially on the IMAX is so beautiful to watch. The settings are perfect and the factory itself is marvelous. Tim Burton knows how to really use a camera to capture a scene and knows how to direct films flawlessly. He captures things like no other director can.<br/><br/>Now let me say this I really like the 1971 film ""Willy Wonka and The Chocolate Factory"" starring Gene Wilder however Burton's version is much better. Why? Well I loved this book when I was a child and the 1971 film wasn't like the book but it was still a good movie. Burton's version is much more loyal to the book and is darker. Depp's version of Wonka is much more creative and creepy then Gene Wilder's Wonka. Burton's version adds much more of the book to this film. It's actually very different throughout the entire movie. Yes, the basic premise is the same but almost everything else is different. There isn't as much singing in the film as in the 1971 version and the Oompa Loompas look more like they did in the book and their songs are a lot cooler in Burton's version. The whole beginning is different, some of the middle is different, and the ending is also different. This is a whole new movie, so if anyone says that it's a complete copycat of the 1971 version, well they are full of crap. Also one last thing Charlie in this film isn't whinny like he was in the 1971 film, and that made his character a lot more likable.<br/><br/>Bottom line, if you like Tim Burton or Johnny Depp, Run don't walk to the nearest theater to see this film. If you have an IMAX near by, go see it on the IMAX. The film is beautiful and seeing on the IMAX only gives more reason to love the film. When I went to the theater today all showings were sold out for the rest of the day. When the film ended, a lot of people clapped including me. Johnny Depp is the best actor out there and he gives Wonka a creepy and sarcastic image which I loved and felt that character needed. Burton's vision of the Dahl's classic story hits the nail right on the head. I have nothing bad to say about this film and this will be one film that I will go to the theater a few times to see. I haven't seen a film that I wanted to see in the theater again in a very long time. This film is another one of Tim Burton's Masterpieces and I absolutely love it.<br/><br/>MovieManMenzel's final rating for ""Charlie and The Chocolate Factory"" is a 10/10. This is the Depp/Burton film I have been waiting for since 1994. Bring the family, go by yourself, but see this film. It's terrific"

The puppets started to sing and move around after a while they moved around the puppets burst into flames then the puppet's eyeball melted out of its head. That was the beginning of 1 out of 6 very weird things not for the under 10 crowd. Mr Wonka seemed to have at first emotional problems relating to family that worked out later but did not need to be addressed in a child's film. Every time that he tried to say the word Father or family he acted like he was going to throw up. My younger children who love the other film would not be able to understand this adult concept nor should they have a reason to."
"Julie-53","4","3","10","16 July 2005"," Not any better than the original! What a disappointment!
","I have to say first that I love the original Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory. I also love Johnny Depp and that is the main reason I went to see this movie, curious to see how this remake would fare against the original. I have to say I was mighty disappointed. Gene Wilder is far better in his portrayal of this character. In short, the movie was not funny, it was just weird. As was Depp in his portrayal of Wonka, not funny either, just weird and a little disturbing. I'm not sure what the point of even making this movie was, as everything was apparently copied from the first movie, and all the best parts of the original left out. The back story of Wonka and his dad was really bizarre, and not really very well integrated into the factory tour. It just felt tacked on as an afterthought to stretch the movie time perhaps? The ending was particularly unsatisfying and anticlimactic. I recommend that you wait and rent this one, or better yet, skip it and rent the original. I think I will because I want to remember how wonder Gene Wilder was in this role."

","I am absolutely horrified by how socially irresponsible this movie is! As an elementary school teacher and future parent, I am shocked at the ""lessons"" that my children could ""learn"" from this film. For example, in order to help prevent child abductions, we always tell our children not to leave public places with strangers, especially when these strangers say that they need the child's help (e.g. to look for a lost puppy). Well, Charlie does this very thing when Willy Wonka finds Charlie out on the street, and asks Charlie to go to Wonka's father's house to help patch up their relationship!!! Pedaphiles across the country - Rejoice! Here is a movie that will help your sick mission.<br/><br/>Beyond the socially irresponsible decisions that the movie made, it is just plain bad. The songs are horrible, the characters ridiculous, the dialogue mind-numbing. I can not say enough to warn you off seeing this movie."
"Riddler2","10","2","6","6 October 2014"," wonderful imagination for children of all ages
","Tim Burton has made a wonderful remake of the 1971 film with Gene Wilder. The 1971 Movie was awful and was not I repeat not faithful to the book at all but this remake is more faithful to the book and more slightly atmospheric compared to the sunny positive message of the original. A few things I need to bring to light here, Johnny Depp's performance is a performance of comic genius and he is quirky and kooky and not too negative compared to Gene Wilder's weird strange performance. The Music and Songs Written by Danny Elfman which use the original lyrics from the book are all unique and styled differently. The Sets are extraordinary beautiful visual creations that make you want to go and visit the factory yourself. It is amazing the level of achievement in this movie is mind blowing. Last few points, People love the 1971 film why I do not know and will never understand, give this one a chance please kids will sit through it even at 110 minutes it never bores you never!"

I did see the 1970s film. I LOVED the 1970s film! Everything about it! This one....has just brought shame to it.<br/><br/>The good: Errrr.....ummmm....well there was almost nothing good about it except for the beginning. It was OK.....until they went into the chocolate factory.....Words can not describe this....But I will anyway for your sake: Some of the stuff in the preview of the movie before it came out were strange. I didn't think that anything from the original would be in it....but then....Now look! The Chocolate room! Now I remember THAT from the original movie! Not so much..... *Warning* *Some spoilers and a list*<br/><br/>The Pipe with the dome around it at the top in the Chocolate room<br/><br/>The ""Hair candy"" in the eventing room.<br/><br/>The Dragon Ship thing in the Chocolate river scene<br/><br/>The Fireworks<br/><br/>The song and dance of puppets near the beginning of the Factory<br/><br/>The Puppet hospital thing<br/><br/>The Squirrel's in the ""Nut room""<br/><br/>And the Flash Backs.<br/><br/>This film drives itself to the point that it doesn't make any sense after a while. The ending was odd to say the least. Why would you wan't to make Wonka look like the bad guy? It's stupid and annoying. The songs by the ompalompa's were just.......wow.....I couldn't make out ANYTHING they were saying!<br/><br/>Next to: Lady in the water, Cat in the hat, and Wild Wild west, this is one of the worst movies I have ever seen.<br/><br/>The final verdict: How this got a score of 7 (See other sites) is just plain scary.<br/><br/>DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE!!!! Even if you are the slight bit curious DO NOT SEE IT!!! I am dead serious......DEAD SERIOUS. Also I would like to add: Next to Judge Doom from ""Who Framed Rogger Rabbit"", Wily Wonka in this movie was one of the freakiest characters I have ever seen.<br/><br/>Instead of this go see:<br/><br/>The original film.<br/><br/>Dude Where's my car?<br/><br/>DragonHeart<br/><br/>or....<br/><br/>Jay and Silent Bob strike back<br/><br/>The movies listed above are WAY, WAY, WAY BETTER THAN THIS!!!!<br/><br/>Don't bother with it, If you see this in the store don't even touch it."

","Let me open with this disclaimer: I am a huge Johnny Depp fan, I think he is a great actor in almost every role he has ever played.<br/><br/>That being said, Burton made a huge mistake in casting his friend Depp in this role. The only way this character could have been worse was if it was played by one of the other Wonka hopefuls, Marilyn Manson...<br/><br/>So speaking of Wonka hopefuls, why wasn't Jim Carrey chosen for the role of Wonka?!?! He has the perfect mix of wackiness with creepy undertones (think cable guy; me, myself, and Irene) that Burton should have been shooting for, which is what Dahl intended in the original book (fun and likable with a hint of danger). Depp/Burton turned the character into a completely freaky unlikeable weirdo that cringed when he came near children and made weird sexual allusions. Not to mention the whole bizarre ""daddy"" and anti-family fixation. I will spare you yet another M. Jackson parallel thesis, but SERIOUSLY! I can't imagine that Carrey commands much more of a salary than Depp so what gives?!"
"eightballoons","3","2","6","30 July 2005"," This Film should have been excellent...
","Tim Burton is quite honestly the best visual storyteller of our day. His films not only capture the full attention of the audience, but also touch the kid in them as well. It is that reason why this film was such a disappointment.<br/><br/>I will admit right from the beginning that I have not read the book and I am also a big fan of the original 1971 film. That being said, I went into this film with knowing full well that I was seeing a retelling of a great story, but more importantly though the eyes of Mr. Burton. But what I saw was nothing more than a D grade commercial blunder.<br/><br/>The film has a strong beginning, and I liked the story behind Charlie and his family, especially his Grandfather. But this is where my interest ends with the characters. The film never draws me in to make me care if anyone gets a golden ticket, especially Charlie. He is just so sickeningly happy throughout the film that when he does find the ticket you aren't even happy for him. <br/><br/>The chocolate factory is even worse, this is when Burton should have shined and at best he was a dirty penny. Each room was uneventful and it was obvious that very little imagination was put into the set design. The fact that CGI played such a heavy role only made it worse, it seemed the rule on set was, make it look like a video game. <br/><br/>I saved the worst for last, and while the theater's sound system may not have helped, the Uoompa Loompa songs were abysmal. At best I understood a word or two throughout each song, which as far as I am concerted is the most important part of the film. It is here where the lessons of the story are laid out to teach how wrong it is to be like these nasty children. Instead all that is learned is how silly modern music styles will translate into a children's movie.<br/><br/>I will say one thing, while Gene Wilder will always be Willy Wonka to me; Johny Depp did a magnificent job getting into character. But as you might have guessed, I didn't like this Wonka either.<br/><br/>I really wanted to write a good review of this film, I just couldn't. It's just not good film, which is as honest as I can get. Tim Burton has proved his talent with his past films; Batman, Edward Scissor Hands and Big fish. In this film he has proved that if given enough money he will be happy to make a bad film as well...sad."
"jenniferdesign","4","2","6","20 July 2005"," Not as expected..at all. Half as good as the original movie!
","I have been a long time supporter of Tim Burton and have loved his movies in the past, but I have to say that I am terribly disappointed with this one. He uses many aspects of the original film without making the new re-make his own. The Oompa Loompas are terrible as digitally reproduced characters with annoying taste in clothing and music. The songs are painfully awful. Danny Elfman was definitely not doing his best here. Johnny Depp is a great actor but he does not shine in this role. The dentures, bad make-up, 60's haircut and juvenile attitude are quite repulsive. The child actors are about half as talented as the original cast. Changing their appearances and adding tons of make-up or digital polishing was just a bad idea. They look like wax dolls. The Grandpa character is totally not as well done in this version. His hero-like portrayal in the earlier version somewhat made the movie. Teaching Charlie as they moved throughout the factory. The new Grandpa looks as though he'll kill over at any moment..and he has no personality other than being an old man with silly glasses. The Charlie character was the most refreshing face in the whole movie. I have to agree that this was about the best decision Burton made in Casting. Burton needs to let go of the absent father hang-ups...it is getting quite pathetic. My favorite part was the beginning where the flames engulf the singing puppets..YAAYY. Very well done. Creepiness all the way..but then..it disappeared. Where did the ultra creepy Burton run away to? Off finishing the movie he really wanted to create.. ""A Corpse Bride""?"

","Visually it's not bad, I find that the children were convincing and they played their roles just fine. Willy Wonka seemed odd (not in an entertaining way). His character seemed shallow and spouted nonsense and giggled alot. Gene's portrayal was deep, he had charisma and he was like a deck of cards. Most of all, Gene was a really good singer and that added more to his role. I give them credit, the chocolate river was pretty cool. In the 70's film, it was a dirty looking river. I watched the ""behind the scenes"" clips and they put in a lot of effort on working on an actual chocolate river. That alone did bump up my score higher than what I was originally going to set it. In conclusion, I thought the movie could have done better. Visually, it was pretty great and some of the roles played by the children weren't have bad either. The other roles fell much shorter. I'm giving this a 4 because it had potential but, fell short to my expectations."

That sucked too, especially in the ""plot"" department. This movie is worth seeing for some attractive set design, ostentatious costumes and Danny Elfman's energetic, whimsical-yet-gothic musical approach. Parts of this film break down in to MTV style music video montage, which is another sign of how shallow and distracting Burton is as a creative force, and storyteller.

","Sometimes the sweetest things in your life are the things that are not so obvious. This lesson is ever so present in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, which takes audiences on this amazingly crazy and dark journey of 5 golden ticket winners through the factory of Mr. Wonka. Through this journey each falls into a trap that was specifically set up for them by Mr. Wonka. While some may think that this journey and direction under Tim Burton is not fitting for a kid's movie, it portrays the story in a much better way than the original by providing stronger performances by actors and creating an emotional backstory that is unique to the movie. Compared to the original Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, Burton overall provides the audience with more elements and layers to this classic story. First off we see him bring his passion for the bizarre, wacky plots, and unique over the top creations that he is known for. Burton sends audiences through a colorful, darker, and more thought provoking journey compared to the original. He takes from the original story we all familiar with and turns it upside down while adding the connection of Wonka's father and harnessing the acting techniques of Johnny Depp. Overall, compared to the original this new emotional connection creates more than a one dimensional Wonka that we see displayed by Wilder and makes him more humanistic and relatable for audiences. As we see throughout the movie we are provided with numerous flashbacks of Wonka's past and his relationship with father that adds to the character of Wonka and the importance of family to him and Charlie. These moments provide the audience with an emotional connection to Wonka as we see a different side of him besides what he displays as he gives the tour to the children. We also see this side of Wonka as he confronts his father and they come to the realization of the success of each and the connection they have been missing all these years. Truly Burton created more depth for not just the character of Wonka, but also the film by making family a central theme to all characters from the 4 other golden ticket winners, to Charlie, and finally Wonka. The most notable character that Burton helped to develop to be a sensation was Mr. Wonka, played none other than the talented and well known Johnny Depp. <br/><br/>Depp brings down the house in this film and embodies Willy Wonka through his minor facial movements, overall actions, and demeanor. Depp takes over Wonka and uses his genius to create a character that is almost like a reality TV host for children as he takes them on this journey through his amazing factory Throughout the movie we see the strong acting choices Depp makes for his character with his varying levels of physicality, precise and on point facial movements, and constant changing of tone in voice. The best glimpses you get of Depp is once each child has fallen into his or her given ""trap"" that Wonka had planned for them as Depp reacts like he knows something is up, but at the same time hides the fact that he is trying to look for one sole heir of his factory. Not only can Depp do an amazing job playing the foolish chocolate maker, but he has a more emotional side due to the recreation that Burton has conjured up for him. Overall, Depp embodies a person with a strong sense of imagination and compassion for others. Due to the efforts that we see Depp display as well as the new elements by Burton the creation of the movie is a visual spectacle that delivers a hidden journey. The hidden elements are what makes the entire piece better. Just like in life those things that we don't expect and may seem hidden can bring us the most joy."

","O.K. ""Willie Wonka"" had it's faults. The first part of it is boring as heck as the Golden Tickets are s-l-o-w-l-y found, including the bogus ones. Why a chicken gets it's head chopped off in the river tunnel ride is still a creepy mystery, but the songs are better, and the special effects are o.k. considering how old that movie is! Having not yet read the original, I suspect the new version is a bit closer to the Ronald Dahl tale. Orange or East-Indian faces, the Ommpa-Lompas steal the show, but the sound mix makes it hard to understand their new lyrics. Squirrels, nuts, geese and golden eggs? Same garbage chute! A bit more magical (and cruel) ending for the 4 obnoxious brats! A father-dentist for a candy-maker is very clever and that's the only thing I like about the remake. It doesn't matter where the Bucket Family lives. It's a fable about searching for true happiness and purpose! Johnny Depp plays his part well as the spirit of Michael Jackson, but like most remakes, It's merely different. It does not surpass the original movie, which didn't need to be remade!"
"ElMaruecan82","7","1","2","31 July 2016"," Pay no attention to that man under the top hat...
","""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" has always been one of my favorite readings this is how I started my review of the 1971 version, the one with Gene Wilder, and I feel like an obligation to say it again for the 2005 adaptation. I don't know if I'm the book's biggest fan, probably not, but as a kid who loved chocolate, great story with great characters, I devoured every chapter of ""Charlie"" as if they were made of cream-nut milk chocolate. So I think I can judge both movies' adaptations with all fairness, giving each one the credit it deserved.<br/><br/>I'm not one of these movie purists who consider the 1971 version the better one on the sole basis that it is the first adaptation or dismiss the 2005 version because Johnny Depp's embodiment of Willy Wonka was leaning a bit too close to the psychopathic side and didn't have that zest of enchantment conveyed by ringmaster Gene Wilder. It is true though, whether it was intentional or not, Depp seemed to have channeled another similarly pale-faced figure of Pop Culture and the fact that he was concerned about children made it all the more creepy. But I think there is good and 'less good' material from each movie and Tim Burton, at least, had the merit to introduce the book to a new generation of little Mike-Teavees, baiting them with a wizardry that had nothing to envy on Willy Wonka's.<br/><br/>The 1971 film was spectacular by the era's standards but there was nothing that could match the sophistication and artistry of the 2000's, when CGI was mastered enough not to be overused. Indeed, CGI only served for scenes that couldn't do without some electronic help, but the rest of the visuals are made of scale-model, meticulously designed set, and even real rivers of chocolate. I saw the film for the first time, I wasn't sure that I would love the characters or the story as much as I love the book, but I knew Tim Burton would push the envelope and delight our eyes. And he did, from the recreation of the Chocolate Factory to the creative impersonation of the Oompas Loompas with diminutive actor Deep Roy and even the contrasts between the first act set in town and all in gray and white with the bright colors of Wonka Land, had some ""Wizard of Oz"" vibes except for the Wizard, himself.<br/><br/>So, for all its triumphant technology, there's one department where the film didn't live up people's expectation, and it's in the portrayal of Willy Wonka. Granted Wonka is not just the flashy guy with the top hat and the purple redingote, Roald Dahl painted him as a rather dark and mysterious character and the merit of Gene Wilder is that he played your typical cheerful master of ceremony, but that was only a cover and step by step, he unveiled some darker and more sarcastic sides of his personality sarcastic (didn't even inspire one of the most popular Internet memes?). Johnny Depp laid his cards too early and never felt like the kind of fellow who could 'understand' children, not in a creepy way anyway, he struck as a sadistic, sociopath man trying so hard to smile and cheer up his guests. Depp is a fine actor, he played his Wonka very well, but I don't think it was the right angle for the movie, especially when the other characters played their part perfectly.<br/><br/>Indeed, I'm not sure I remember any other actors from the 1971 film, except Gene Wilder, Jack Albertson and the blonde-faced Charlie looked weird, but the real star was Wilder, to the point the film was titled after his character. For its own good, the 2005 movie didn't focus too much on Wonka, and one of the many delights was to enjoy the performances of the kids who played the bad ones. The gluttonous Augustus Gloop, Mike teavee with his mean-looking eyes, and the two girls (Julia Winter and AnnaSophia Robb) were perfect Viloet Beauregarde and Veruca Salt, mannerisms, costume design and attitudes with their parents. As for Charlie who's not the most colorful character but rather the pillar and quiet strength of the story, Fredddie Highmore is Charlie like I imagined him. David Kelly also plays an unforgettable Grandpa Joe, I only wish the film didn't overlook some interesting scenes, like their laughing reaction when they don't find the golden ticket, the scene was cut rather abruptly.<br/><br/>It's very unsettling that the one role that should've been pivotal to the film's success was the worse, but like Ebert says; the film works despite Depp. A chocolate factory is supposed to be the place any child would love to go, but they'd think twice if they saw that weird dark stranger with the creepy smile. I'm surprised Tim Burton didn't try to adjust Depp's performance because there's something in Burton's work that make him the cinematic heir of Dahl. Both are men who preserved their childhood vision and knew children enough not to patronize them with cute or overly preachy material. They were men of thrills, of adventures and mystery, but there was a heart in their story. And ""Charlie"", more than chocolate, is a beautiful story about family and Burton magnificently recreated the loving atmosphere of the Bucket's nest, perhaps the richest family in town if you count love as wealth.<br/><br/>And there's a statement about family in the little artistic license he takes by venturing into the backstory of Wonka and his Oedipal issues with his dentist of a father (played by Christopher Lee). But while it was a good idea on the paper, Depp's performance was too unpleasant to make us care for it once the tour was over. So it all comes down to the 1971 having Willy Wonka and 2005 the magic of the book and the casting. Which one I prefer? Well, like I said in the 1971 review the book, naturally."
"Isawthat","6","1","2","9 July 2016"," Closer to the book but not as sweet as Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory.
","So much to live up to, Johnny normally shines in off beat rolls, but whether direction or personal choices let the Willy W character be far less sweet in this attempt.<br/><br/>The use of CGI must have saved quite a lot of time and effort as well as $, and in my opinion brought something to it that the original had no access to, though the original used what was available to a far greater extent and wins hands down regardless.<br/><br/>The actors were either better actors or better directed in the original.<br/><br/>Found it far easier to get lost in the original.<br/><br/>Certain scenes lacked the the brilliance brought to the original by Gene Wilder, especially when gene got spooky and intense.<br/><br/>Watch them both, they are both enjoyable, but the 1971 offering still wins easily."
"saint_sophie","6","1","2","10 June 2016"," Pretty enjoyable in itself
","I think the best thing to do with this film is to not compare it to the original, as I think people are very quick to do this and thus the remake gets slated a lot more than it deserves. Although there are parts of this film which grate me a little bit, it actually is a decent film in its own right.<br/><br/>It certainly remains truer to the novel than the 1971 film, though you have to remember that the special effects which existed in 2005 certainly did not exist in the early 1970s. A lot of people have an issue with the addition of Willy Wonka's backstory with his father as a dentist. I didn't like it much at first, but it's definitely grown on me. In fact, I find it quite touching.<br/><br/>The CGI effects and the features of the factory are magnificent, but sometimes it's a bit too overkill, even to the point where the human characters look computerised. Willy Wonka himself is portrayed by Johnny Depp as a highly eccentric, constantly bug-eyed and misanthropic creep, quite frankly - but it works pretty well for a story which undeniably has dark undertones.<br/><br/>My biggest problem with the film was the kids. I know they were supposed to be brats, but here they are simply detestable, especially the obnoxious Violet Beauregarde who at least was somewhat likable in the 1971 film. Paradoxically, Charlie (Freddie Highmore) is at the complete opposite end of the spectrum. Although Freddie plays Charlie very well, he's just too... saintly and good. The characters don't have much depth to them at all but then I suppose you make allowances as it is a children's story and film. The kids' acting also left a lot to be desired. Instead of having expressions of awe and wonder which is what you undeniably WOULD have, their faces remained expressionless throughout most of the film. I think another reviewer may have mentioned that gazing at a green screen for hours on end may have contributed to this, however.<br/><br/>Which leads me onto my next point: the Oompa Loompas. I love Deep Roy multiplied by 1000 and the scenes were pretty creative and entertaining. But the songs... Just no. ''Oompa-Loompa Doompadee Doo'' is a catchy classic. Here, they sound mechanical, unintelligible and just painful to listen to. There's also a scene where they do some weird boogieing when serenading Veruca Salt's demise. I actually felt my toes curl with embarrassment at that part.<br/><br/>Overall it's a decent film; it's not magnificent, but it's fun and entertaining."

","Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is quite a hated movie, being the remake of a beloved classic and all. I personally love this movie more than the original. <br/><br/>Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is one of my childhood favorites. I liked the original when I was young also, but not nearly as much as this one. Burton's world is just so colorful and imaginative and is filled with things that make you want to explore it.<br/><br/>One of the best parts of the movie where it succeeds over the original in my opinion is the characters. They're all quirky and fit in with the strange feel of the movie. Some may complain that Charlie is more perfect compared to the original where he was flawed with the one scene with the fizzy drinks. However, all the other children are one- note and exaggerated, so Charlie being perfect fits in more with the atmosphere of the movie. Depp plays a completely different performance compared to Wilder's as Willy Wonka, and whichever one you like more will depend on your tastes<br/><br/>Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is a fun and often wrongly criticized movie. It is a very fun experience which I highly recommend."

","The story of Charlie Bucket and his golden ticket to Willy Wonka's wondrous chocolate factory has always been one of my favorites! The original children's book by Roald Dahl and classic film adaptation starring Gene Wilder are both incredibly charming, funny, and entertaining tellings of this story. But, this newer, Tim Burton-Johnny Depp version really lacks some of the wonder, charm, heart, and excitement of those two original versions. Sure, there's bits of these elements throughout, but they aren't handled nearly as well or used nearly as much in this version.<br/><br/>However, the film does deserve quite a bit of credit for being an incredible visual feast, much more so than the original Gene Wilder version. This is, of course, to be expected in a Tim Burton film. No matter how GOOD the actual movie is, Burton always manages to make the visuals at least look pretty cool, so I have to give the movie credit for that. There's also plenty of funny moments here and there and the film is, overall, pretty entertaining. even in Depp isn't nearly as good of a Willy Wonka as Gene Wilder was."

","A retelling of the classic story originally written by Roald Dahl (you might remember the original film, Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory). Directed by Tim Burton, this movie looks smoother and sweeter than ever but of course hides a darker side. This version of the story captures elements of the book that the original film never did and helps reveal the inner workings of Willy Wonker's mind. In case you've never heard of it before, this film is about an eccentric chocolate factory owner that invites five children (and their guardian) into his factory and encourages his factory workers to sing and dance while the children are injured."
"Rickting","7","1","2","12 January 2015"," A deliciously dark fantasy with plenty of personality, although it doesn't match the book
","Roald Dahl is a very good children's author, and his books are definitely recommended. Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is one of his best, centring on a boy who's one of 5 children allowed a special tour of an amazing chocolate factory owned by an eccentric chocolate making genius. The original was not a film I particularly liked although I haven't seen it for many years. This is, overall, a good, solid adaptation which has plenty of flavour and personality. Tim Burton may not be the right choice to direct, but his amazing visuals, use of quirky surrealism and interesting colour palette make the film unique and fascinating, if overly dark at times. To sum up, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is the cinematic representation of a visually appealing piece of dark chocolate. The child actors, especially Freddie Highmore, are actually good for once and it's an entertaining, unique screenplay as well. There's a mild emotional centre and the ending is reasonably uplifting. In general, the film brings the book to life is visually stunning and quirky fashion, and Roald Dahl would probably like this version more as it's closer to the book.<br/><br/>There are flaws though. While the visuals are great, the film can feel fairly artificial and Burton avoids using too much CGI, but a lot of the film just doesn't look real. It brings Roald Dahl's dark humour to the screen, but at times it just feels a bit mean spirited. It's a bit too long as well, with an unnecessary epilogue which deviates from the source material as well as a dull flashback subplot which not even the great Christopher Lee can make interesting. The main let down is Johnny Depp's repulsive portrayal of Willy Wonka, which is creepy, off putting and completely over the top. The Oompa Loompas are quite entertaining, but Johnny Depp gives what might be his worst and most misguided performance. With the emphasis on visuals and dark humour, at times a sense of charm is lost. Also, it's possible Tim Burton, although a strong director overall, with his quirky visuals and darkness, just isn't quite the right choice to adapt the book. Still, this is a good film; not the best thing Burton has done but it's an entertaining family film with a dark and unique flavour of its own.<br/><br/>7/10"
"stephen7272","8","1","2","11 June 2013"," Outsourcing makes sense
","Some reviewers said ""This film is just wrong and horrible"" and another ""Garbage. Absolute, pure, filthy garbage.""<br/><br/>They expected a children's movie full of innocence and instead received a horror movie.<br/><br/>This 2005 version reminded me of the cruelty of the child-snatcher in Chitty Chitty Bang Bang. But it's emphasis is educational. It obfuscates the industrial reality we all live in for the benefit of children. Among it's sweet candies are examples of redundancy in the work place, the loss of patent protection, the outsourcing of jobs, the issue of waste disposal and several other contemporary industrial related themes. The adults in the audience will identify most of them.<br/><br/>In addition it tells us a little about the modern consumer. It tells us that the rich kids get everything they want and the poor kids feed upon hopes and dreams. The Golden Ticket is the Lottery Ticket, the town and factory are set in a late Victorian landscape and Willy Wonka himself has to fall in love with himself because nobody else will. <br/><br/>The film is a very good attempt at merging many of the issues we face today in our society. It's not very good at being a children's movie since the special effects are rather tame compared with it's competitors.<br/><br/>My personal favourite scene in the movie is the where the mechanical marionettes are used to welcome the the guests. They fail and spit fire from faulty wiring. That scene is an attempt to say ""Goodbye"" to the earlier Wonka film of the 70's and usher in a new, far more brutal reality. <br/><br/>My own criticism is that some later components in the movie tend to mirror elements in the end of the Hitchhikers Guide To The Galaxy movie.<br/><br/>Note: It would have been interesting to have made the movie more sinister by casting Peter Cushing as Willy Wonka rather than as his father. Even better, Vincent Price, RIP."

","Tim Burton and Johnny Depp combine to bring the classic novel by Roald Dahl to the big screen and manage to capture all of the elements that make the original book so beloved even to this day.<br/><br/>Depp is the perfect Wonka and brings all the elements that people have had in their heads about the character onto the screen. He's creepy, he's funny but at all times he is believable and it is his persona that helps carry the film.<br/><br/>The film itself is visually stunning and the cast is great.

","Although I do not find this movie as good as the original, I do love the twist Tim Burton has done to this classic story. The more out there thinking that Depp has brought to Willy Wonka makes his performance unforgettable. Some will say this movie is a waste of money and may have not liked it, but if you take into account the age group this movie is aimed at it has the great balance of humor, most young teenagers will understand.<br/><br/>This movie has a great quirkiness that gives it a charm and has been harshly evaluated by a lot of people.

","I am a big fan of Johnny Depp, so watching this film was a must for me. I didn't read the book nor watch the earlier movie so I will make no comparisons. You will find many reasons to like this film: The ingenious Freedie Highmore, the outstanding special world that will fascinate you from the first moment, the weird and superb performance of Johnny Depp as Willy Wonka, yet it is not a complete masterpiece. Something big is missing. During watching I was waiting for 'something' to happen which I didn't know what exactly. Furthermore, the ending was far from satisfaction. Also the part of Wonka's childhood was kinda not convenient. This film could be better hundred times but I don't know how if you ask me!"

","Burton & Co. get points for trying something new. They could have made a slicker version of the '71 film. It would have made money. Everyone must have been shown that film ten times and told ""Don't do that"", because the new one very carefully avoided any reference to that one. <br/><br/>So they tried something different. The new subplots don't hurt the film and opening up the tour with flashbacks was a good idea. The Oompa trickery is cool, it was worth doing. The songs are OK, just not very memorable (a shame because the '71 version's will stick with you forever). No one seemed to understand what's funny quite as well as the underpaid kid who played VERUCA far over the top in '71 like a mini Margaret Hamilton. Of course, those who haven't seen the first version can easily rectify the mistake with a 1-euro trip to the local video rental joint. <br/><br/>No actor could read any part in this film and make it work, and that's probably why the cutting is so quick. There isn't a line in this dog worth hearing. So once Burton's run through all his satirical set, costume, and makeup gags-- and you can only show Veruca's teeth twice before it gets stale, go and try that in front of a club audience-- he has nothing to do but say ""speed"" let the actors read what all those official producers vetted and hope the graphics kids and animal trainers come up with something. What they came up with is worth looking at, but it's all empty calories. <br/><br/>Poor Johnny Depp. He worked hard. He came up with a good new idea for Wonka-- one that's intrinsically funny and also very clever (since the plastic surgery would have covered up Wonka's age). But he has to carry the movie-- in color tinting-- for two hours. And the poor guy is given nothing to read. The audience should come out of this movie laughing and saying ""Freaky-- but wasn't that funny when Wonka said...?"" Not with a confused ""If I think 'Art' is bad does that mean it's good?"" look. <br/><br/>Can you really make a slick costly movie about a poor boy who defeats four slick costly monsters? Yes but you'd better make it funny. Since there's no SLUGWORTH to set up the wrong decisions by the 4 kids their big crime appears to be just being born to tacky parents. They spent huge $$$ to make a giant seahorse-- lifted from the Esther Williams 1944 BATHING BEAUTY, by the way-- and they can't afford a joke?"

","First, the original film in 1971 was so good, they didn't need to re-make it. If Hollywood can't develop any original ideas, they should just shut down. I mean, what next? A re-make of ""Titanic""? This film is weird. It's best redeeming characteristic is it is more faithful to the novel than the original film. I mean, Charlie actually has a father in this one! The backstories given by Grandpa Joe in the beginning are good, in this sense.<br/><br/>However, the backstories given on Wonka's character are silly and just emphasize more emphatically the strange performance by Johnny Depp. He's one of my favorite actors, and perhaps one of the best of his generation, but this is not a good performance. It's odd, and it's not remotely engaging enough. It's cold, robotic and neurotic. Did Depp even read the book? Am I being too enamored of the old traditional story? In almost every way, this film falls short of the 1971 version: inferior acting, inferior music numbers, inferior plot. Watch it out of curiosity, but go rent the old version for a truly magical experience like the book offers.<br/><br/>NOW, if they could just make a film version of ""Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator"", that would be worth seeing ..."

","It has always been a mystery to me as to why movie makers continuously seek to RE-make classic films. The original if done well, earned it's special niche, fulsome praise and the loyalty of it's viewers. In addition, it also established itself as the standard by which all others will to be compared with. Try as they may, few remakes even come close to the original, others fall well short of the mark. Thus is Charlie and the Chocolate Factory with Johhny Depp. There is much a magical talent like Depp can add to a film. In this movie however, he does not add, but subtracts. His humor is far too subtle and overly serious for the part. The original with Gene Wilder is more exciting, colorful and enjoyable. This version begins and ends with a dark parody of the original. The film lacks heart and direction and too often the viewer seeks familiar ground only to find it wanting. In conclusion, this version is a sad reflection of the original and not to be taken as anything but a crude copy of it's intended. A great waste of both time and talent. *"
"Boba_Fett1138","7","1","2","22 November 2005"," Visually a wonderful movie but lacks substance.
","No doubt that kids will love this movie. The imaginary world inside the factory is stunning and looks delicious. It's too bad that the visuals most of the time are more present as the story, even though the story has a good message and moral in it, but because of the overly present visual style, this doesn't really reach the audience as much and as good as the story intended it to. Style over substance you could say.<br/><br/>Still ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" is a wonderfully entertaining movie to watch. Not only the visuals impress but also the actors. Johnny Depp is perfectly eccentric as candy maker Willy Wonka. He lovely goes over-the-top at times without becoming ridicules. There really are some laugh out loud moments with him. Also more than great was the young Freddie Highmore as Charlie Bucket. Perfectly cast were also Helena Bonham Carter and Noah Taylor as Charlie's parents. Christopher Lee also shows up in a small but good and fun role, as Willy Wonka's father, who is obsessed with keeping his sons teeth in good and clean shape. <br/><br/>The movie certainly has some fun characters in it! All of the kids and parents who visits Willy Wonka's chocolate factory are stereotypical and over-the-top but because of that at the same time work perfectly for the movie its entertainment value. But at the same time all of the characters in the movie lack real depth because they aren't exactly realistic. The movie is mostly entertaining and because of this the movie its message and moral simply don't work out in the sequences toward the ending.<br/><br/>Some of the highlights of the movie were the Oompa Loompa song and dance numbers. All of the Oompa Loompa's are played by Deep Roy who has already received a bit of a cult-status. The musical numbers are perfectly eccentrically scored by composer Danny Elfman, who also did all of the singing voices for the Oompa Loompa's himself.<br/><br/>The sets in- and outside the factory are really impressive and so are the costumes. It all visually really is eye candy to look at. Fans of Tim Burton will not be disappointed by this!<br/><br/>Not the must see I expected and hoped it to be but still a perfectly entertaining movie, that's worth seeing.<br/><br/>7/10<br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"
"Monotreme02","4","1","2","27 October 2005"," Visually stunning and brilliantly made
","Oh, what fun it is to see a film that is so delightful in every possible way imaginable. Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, the new film by Tim Burton, starring Johnny Depp, is the most fun I've had at the cinema this year (so far).<br/><br/>I've been a fan of Tim Burton for quite some time now, and he is my favorite film director. I grew up on some of his films, and have seen the rest of them numerous times. With 'Charlie and the Chocolate Facotry', Tim Burton basically combines all of his styles into one film. On the one hand, it contains some really twisted (but ultimately funny) aspects: Willy Wonka's character is hysterically weird. The four other children that enter the factory, excluding Charlie, are completely twisted and vile. Visually, though, it is far more reminiscent to the colorful majesty of Big Fish. And thematically, it is reminiscent of the magical pureness of Edward Scissorhands, while still combining deep and meaningful themes like in Big Fish. Since it combines all of his styles, does this mean that Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is Tim Burton's best film? Nearly. I think that Big Fish is better  but only by a little bit.<br/><br/>Tim Burton's influence on Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is one of the most prominent aspects of it. The sets are absolutely gorgeous. They are wild, twisted and extremely Burtonesque (Tim Burton is probably the only director alive who has an adjective named after him). From the lopsided set of the Buckets' house, which is very reminiscent of Edward Scissorhands' house, to the wacky, colorful, but twisted set of the Chocolate river room, which is reminiscent of set designs from The Nightmare Before Christmas in terms of color and style, Tim Burton's trademark visual style is at its full force in the film. The movie is so visually rich, that it's a treat just to look at it.<br/><br/>Another main attraction of the movie is Johnny Depp, who manages to completely steal the show. Depp has a history of portraying weird and quirky characters, especially in Burton's films (Edward Scissorhands, Ed Wood, Ichabod Crane, etcetera), but Willy Wonka drives all of those into the ground in terms of weirdness. Depp has total control of his character, and portrays him brilliantly. Of course, this comes as no surprise  Depp is one of the most versatile and talented actors alive. Johnny Depp has played such a wide variety of characters; I'm convinced that he can play any character he wants. From the crazy, quirky pirate Jack Sparrow to the subtle, human pureness of J. M. Barrie, Johnny Depp is extremely versatile. While it's tempting to say this, Willy Wonka is not based on Michael Jackson. In fact, aside from the fact that they're both pale, I don't see the connection. As Johnny Depp said himself in interviews, Michael Jackson likes children, while Willy Wonka hates them and couldn't care less about them. He said that he based Willy Wonka on a combination of Howard Hughes, Captain Kangaroo, Mister Rogers and various game show hosts from the '60s. Of course, his performance is brilliant.<br/><br/>Another star of the film is Danny Elfman, who produces yet another absolutely brilliant musical score. The opening credits theme is sort of a combination of his Edward Scissorhands and Spider-Man scores, and is completely brilliant. It totally puts you in the mood of the film, and gives you this little taste of what's to come. But aside from doing the musical score, Danny Elfman also performed the Oompa Loompa songs  including the singing. He sang all of the Oompa Loompa voices, which were later all spliced together. The last time I remember Danny Elfman singing in a movie was in Nightmare Before Christmas  he sang the voice of Jack Skellington. It's good to see (I mean, hear) that he can still do the musical singing.<br/><br/>All in all, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is a thoroughly entertaining, extremely funny and delightfully magical movie. It is visually stunning and brilliantly made, but it also includes a deep, meaningful message and great character development. Johnny Depp shines in his role, and the directing is top-notch. In my opinion, this film is about as close to perfection as movies get (but it is not perfect), and is the best movie of 2005 so far. Go see this with your parents, grandparents, cousins, movie-buff friends, nephews and nieces everyone can and will enjoy this film."
"noralee","6","1","2","22 September 2005"," See on the Big Screen for The Delightful Sights and Sounds
","""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" is a visual and aural delight, even with the worn-out print I saw as probably the last New Yorker to see the film. The production design and Danny Elfman's music are worth a movie screen experience, and the script occasionally shows the cynical and whimsical flair that Roald Dahl was known for, including updated cultural references, such as very funny satires of MTV.<br/><br/>Never having read the book, so I don't know what was faithful, changed or updated, nor have I seen the earlier adaptation, so this was my first experience with the story and it could be this generation's The ""Wizard of Oz."" Even if the visuals are consistent with the book's descriptions and did not spring from director Tim Burton's conception, the details are wonderful. <br/><br/>Outstanding are how the choreography and deadpan of the multiplying Oompa Loompa, portrayed by the obviously up for anything Deep Roy (and sung by Elfman), are wonderful in those marvelous settings. The rest of the acting amidst the sets and blue screens, other than ""Charlie""s parents --nice to see Noah Taylor playing someone relatively normal for a change--and grandparents, are a bit weak. While the other children's parents besides James Fox are just plain bland and have wavering accents, Johnny Depp is simply unappealing, from his voice and body language to his make-up, and not just because he's creepily like Michael Jackson. His occasional tart jibes show refreshing flashes of spirit that make the rest of his performance just that much more dull. Christopher Lee adds his usual panache to the typical movie stereotypes of an evil dentist, though surely the floss reference is not from the book. Freddie Highmore as ""Charlie"" is more earnest than natural. <br/><br/>Geoffrey Holder's narration sounds charming. It's not only lovely to hear his Caribbean lilt, but it's nice to know that Morgan Freeman doesn't have the monopoly on voice-overs. <br/><br/>Though the ending comes a bit close to cloying, the film does not talk down to children, who should be able to appreciate the lessons the very funny annoying kids are taught."
"ProperCharlie","8","1","2","12 September 2005"," Saccharine
","My expectations for this film were low. Although I'm a big Tim Burton fan, this looked far too sweet a confection for me to enjoy. My fillings throbbed anxiously at the prospect of being saturated in sugar saturated colours and maddeningly loud, shouty morals. I had the book read to me as a child and loved it. I've read in adulthood and found it to be wonderfully arch but more of a revenge on the bits of the world he didn't like by Roald Dahl. I've also seen the 1971 version of the story and enjoyed it.<br/><br/>Sweet it was. Loud it was. Colourful it was. My filings did rattle in fear round their cavities however, I enjoyed it immensely. Leaving the cinema I felt like Augustus Gloop covered in chocolate yet finding that he tasted so good. The day was bright afterwards, although considerably less colourful. It's faithful to the book with just enough small diversions to make it relevant to a more modern audience. The glass elevator is faithfully depicted are the squirrels, the inventing room, and the TV room.<br/><br/>Best of all is the chocolate world with its chocolate river. Johnny Depp shines as Willy Wonka, acting like he's in Dr. Seuss inspired nightmare of Michael Jackson after meeting the ghost of Howard Hughes. Not of this world. A twisted individual, tortured by an orthodontically-retentive father, into a sugar-free Oedipal fantasy creature. In the chocolate land, his simultaneous fascination with his land and his disgust at children, their (ssssh) parents, and the rest of world in general is wonderful. The look on his face is pure badly-repressed 'ick'. Freud would have had a field day.<br/><br/>The child actors do well, especially Jordan Fry playing Mike Teevee. I suspect this is the character most modern children will sympathise with. Tim Burton questions Roald Dahl's simple world using him as a mouthpiece, unfortunately he mumbles all these lines. Well Willy Wonka seems to think so anyway. The wonderfully updated chocolate room scene including an awful lot of bits out of '2001: A Space Odyssey' made me laugh out loud to the chagrin of the rest of the audience.<br/><br/>The added bits of backstory for Willy Wonka work well with the surprise appearance of Christopher Lee as his father. Tim Burton's now worked with two of the unholy trinity. It is a pity that Peter Cushing is no longer around for him to complete the set. This film does not debase the wonderful 1971 movie, it compliments it. Very rare for a remake of a much loved film. If you can ignore the sheer sugariness of this film, there's a lot of fun to be had here. Buy an everlasting gobstopper at the concessions stand and go see."

","For Gene Wilder's version of the bizarre Willy Wonka, Johnny Depp takes a very great knock-out on the 70ties comedian. He outplays him on every level, from being pure funny to Mr. Mental, and you can totally see that Depp enjoys it all with great pleasure. So on, Tim Burton's visions go wild as usual when he adds grimy, Gothic undertones and fabulous pop-artistic moods - and in CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY this works perfect.<br/><br/>FINDING NEVERLAND'S brilliant boy Freddie Highmore adds sentimental sides and pure saint behavior into Charlie Bucket were Roald Dahl's original kiddo had a far more rebellious side of the boy. So, Highmore works brilliant in the character - and the four other kids who won the golden ticket are all for-filling, from the disgusting Augustus to the outrageous Violet, the cocky Veruca to the not-bothering Mike.<br/><br/>So, this imaginative movie goes over the top in its brilliant universe and is a fully on family-movie from the guy who gave us grimy tales as EDWARD SCISSORHANDS, SLEEPY HOLLOW and now CORPSE BRIDE. Without missing a step in his travel to family-movie, it's all so perfect lied out. Everything from the Willy Wonka chocolate factory's bicycle-messengers to the crow-castle that the Bucket's live in. The untamed clothes and the in-between of Goth, as the pink-dragon-boat that runs down a Hellish disco-tunnel (this time without Gene Wilder's hypnotizing and funny song).<br/><br/>You will find this movie amusing, it's just a thing that can't go wrong. It's way too bizarre to not be interested in, and way too sweet to not be emotionally moved by."

In many ways Wonka shares the same desire for acceptance that Scissorhands did.<br/><br/>For anyone that doesn't know the story, 5 golden tickets are placed at random in chocolate bars with the winners receiving the trip of the lifetime around the chocolate factory. Four of the winners are rather unsavoury characters, but Charlie is the perfect child.<br/><br/>With all the usual visual dazzle of a Burton movie and a typically quirky Depp performance it's very entertaining."

The master of Dark Comedy Dahl and the twisted and macabre Burton collide on the screen with wonderful effects. Aside from a few weak moments here and there this film is wonderful. It has a style and a flair that is distinctly Burton, but remains true to the unique vision of Dahl. Comparisions between this and the other version are pointless. Each needs to stand on its own merits.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp's performance is not what I would have imagined for the candymaker, but he does a creditable job none the less. His co-stars are well cast, and I would like to see more of David Morris' work. It's hard to believe that he only began professional acting at age 79.<br/><br/>While I will always treasure the original film I can give credit where credit is due.

"Bastian Balthazar Bux","6","1","2","17 July 2005"," A creative, colorful, and very fun letdown.
","I was looking forward to this movie most of anybody. I'd followed it from pre-production. All of my favorite critics loved it, and I was told by matineed friends that I would love it. And by God I wanted to love it.<br/><br/>I struggled. Every time something happened that struck me the wrong way, I pretended I didn't really notice. But unfortunately, those things added up quickly.<br/><br/>I couldn't shake the feeling that I couldn't make a stand on whether or not I thought Charlie was a good movie. I feel like I can't say it's a bad movie, because there are too many wonderful pieces and moments to save it from that judgment. But I can't say it's a good movie either, because it fails on so many levels.<br/><br/>Take the inclusion of Willy Wonka's father, for instance. A character not in the book, Burton's decision to make Wonka a man troubled by his estranged paternal relationship only added a level of cheesiness that seriously hindered the film's capacity to intrigue us. Wonka is a character of mystery, he is the great recluse of our time--a character who revels in childish inanity but is also gifted with extraordinary genius (he has made the impossible possible). To explain his character so simply and Hallmarky (he just needed Daddy to love him!) completely betrays what he is supposed to represent. Wonka doesn't have these Freudian issues--he is the embodiment of creative glee.<br/><br/>Secondly, take the EXclusion of the fizzy-lifting drink theft. Besides reducing the chocolate factory to essentially four explored rooms (one for each naughty child), it robs the humanity from Charlie and his grandfather. They are fallible! The point is that they are well-intentioned. Their mistake serves to show us both that there is no perfection and that intentions make the man.<br/><br/>As I just said, the chocolate factory itself was seriously dampened. It seems that here Burton and Co. spent endless time designing the four disaster rooms, and merely created weak filler for the rest.<br/><br/>And last but certainly not least is the CGI. Not just cartoonish, the CGI in this film was completely distracting. Maybe it's just me, but I can't stand the look of the stuff. In Star Wars it bothers me too, but I'm willing to accept it because the entire world is computer-generated. However, to have a room filled with fantastic tangible gadgets and then insert a PlayStation 2 quality blueberry girl is distracting and lazy. Burton used to be a wizard with visual effects. Take the makeup in Edward Scissorhands, the monsters in Beetlejuice, the villains and gadgets in Batman, even the gore effects in his last great movie, Sleepy Hollow. Willy Wonka's factory should appear cartoonish and bizarre, yes, but not impossible. By using CGI instead of creative effects, we are being told that it is in fact IMPOSSIBLE for these things to exist in real life. They have to be fabricated, drawn in.<br/><br/>Of course, the film has its great moments. The adaptation of the book is faithful, right down to the Oompa Loompa lyrics. Charlie's house is slanted, and I was happy to see the story of the Sultan come to the screen. Depp's Wonka is seriously flawed (I just think it's not an appropriate incarnation of Dahl's character), but he does pull off the occasional moment of maniacal genius. The children are much more realistic in this day and age, children I recognized from my life. And Burton's exaggerated color schemes are brilliant, his characters properly caricatured, his comedic timing perfected. Freddie Highmore is an amazing little boy actor.<br/><br/>I really wanted to LOVE this movie. And I will see it again. But right now I must maintain it was neither good nor bad, it just wasn't Dahl. It opted to replace his black satirical warmth with an obvious warmth. It too often went for the obvious joke when the opportunity arose. And between its magnificent pieces it did something no Dahl adaptation should ever do--it got boring.<br/><br/>Just to clarify, I didn't hate it. I just didn't like it very much. I'm sure a lot of people are going to love this movie, but I for one couldn't lie to myself. I'd love to pretend that it was dark, that it was diabolically ingenious, that it was smart, that it was amazing. And you know what? If little kids go see this and are completely awed then Tim Burton has done his job. It just wasn't for me. And I couldn't convince myself it was, no matter how much I wanted to.<br/><br/>B- A creative, colorful, and very fun letdown."

","Well I really didn't expect the remake to be all that good, but I guess it isn't all that bad.....if you're 7 years old. If you already seen the original than I wouldn't bother watching this one. Depp was pretty scary, they could have just put Michael Jackson in it. Anyways if you have young children than it wouldn't be that bad to go see it. Very few funny spots. Almost exactly like the original with a few additions. personally I think the best part about both the original and the remake are the little ""oompa loom pas"". I find that the film makes you hungry, with all the candy and stuff. If you have nothing better to do then go see it, otherwise I wouldn't really recommend seeing this movie."
"the_unc","6","2","7","11 August 2005"," Looks nice, tastes bitter
","So I agree largely with the hundreds of people who say that the film looks impressive with its stunning sets etc. Depp's performance was good, but as others have said, a little too Jackson-esquire to feel quite right.<br/><br/>HOWEVER, whatever you think of Burton's directing, why oh why must these Hollywood interpretations always remove the very soul and purpose of a book? In the book (and the 1971 film) the other four children disappear as per in Burton's film, and then Wonka sends an oompa loompa to take away their parents. Then, they are never mentioned again. Also, there is no happy ending. The glass elevator flies out of the top of the factory, and it ends. There's no paternal reunion (because that sub-plot didn't exist) and there is certainly no happy family in the factory scene.<br/><br/>To summarise, a little mystery and unknown is just unacceptable in a film these days. The idea that a kid could leave the cinema and think, ""well I wonder what happened to all the other kids?"" or ""what happens to Charlie?"" seems to be beyond Burton, which is frankly a shame as it ruins an otherwise superb film.<br/><br/>still, it's worth a watch."
"alp1981","5","2","7","20 July 2005"," Instant Classic
","First off, Gene Wilder IS Willy Wonka. Anyone who has seen Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory knows this. No one could ever do a better job than Wilder.<br/><br/>Obviously Tim Burton and Johnny Depp have some big shoes to fill. In my opinion, they nailed it! Rather than copy Wilder, Burton and Depp re-imagined the Wonka character to be even more quirky, socially awkward, and even a little sympathetic than the original. Depp was amazingly terrific as Willy Wonka, I can't even begin to put it into words. It would have been too easy for Tim Burton to cast Jim Carrey or Mike Myers as Wonka (which would have been a mistake) but the frequent combination of Burton and Depp turn this into an instant classic. Its like Burton reached into my brain and pulled out exactly what I imagined the Chocolate Factory to be when I read the books all those years ago. The one thing I did not like were the new Oopma Loompas. They looked cool and did what they were supposed to do, but the new songs don't hold a candle to the originals. And the kids! Where did Burton find these kids?!? They are perfect! With the exception of Charlie, all of the new kids are just as good if not better than the originals. The new Charlie just wasn't pathetic enough, in my opinion. I missed the line ""I bet the gold makes the chocolate taste terrible.""<br/><br/>Awesome cast. Again, especially Depp. Although, part of me kind of wonders what Christopher Walken would have been like as Wonka. I can just imagine: ""Shut up your face... little girl... before I drown... your no good father... in the chocolate river over there... OK... a sweetheart?"" Sorry to get off topic. 'Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory' will always be near and dear to my heart, but I gotta big heart and there is plenty of room for Tim Burton, Johnny Depp and 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.' See it on the big screen and then buy it when it comes out on DVD.<br/><br/>10 out of 10"

I'm almost too depressed to type. Seriously.....I want to cry. No Snozzberries, no ""Cheer up Charlie"" no ""Pure Imagination"". No ""Golden Ticket song"" Nothing' at all. It was PRETTY WEAK. The infamous Boat Scene was written simply as a class 3 whitewater (brownwater) ride, no psychedelic freakout, which I was greatly hoping to see, what with all Mr. Burton's knack for being creepy. The Oompa loompas...turned into little digital disco monkeys in shiny suits. THEY WEREN'T EVEN ORANGE!!! As simple as the Oompa-Loompa songs in the original were, THEY WERE GREAT! The writing for the songs in this film was flat-out awful. The song sequences were WAY overdone, I got chills and goosebumps...because I was embarrassed for whomever wrote the songs. In fact, the writing of the entire script was shallow, unmysterious, unfunny, and just plain bad. Johnny Depp was frail as Wonka. A paper-thin wafer of what the character could have, and should have been. All of the characters were weak, except Grampa Joe. Grampa Joe was cool. The cinematography was, as expected, excellent. The film was visually appealing. I had no doubt that it wouldn't be. But that was all shot down the big chocolate chute by the lacklustre script. I knew as soon as I realized there was no ""Fizzy Lifting Drink"" drink scene, that the ending would suck too. And it did. Well, I'm gonna go shoot myself in the face. I hope you're happy Mr. Depp."

I think Roald Dahl would have been very pleased. A lot of People have been saying it probably sucks, but if you see it, it will change your mind. it was different from what I expected, but different in a good way. It has a back story to explain why Willie is so weird, there is a different ending, different songs (originally written by Roald Dahl-set to music and performed by Danny Elfman) and even a different moral.

Tim Burtons terrible directing (remember planet of the apes?) kept him well in check. The oompa Loompas were about as good as the rest of the bunch.

","I feel sorry for any kid who has this forced upon him or her when a near perfect version of this book already exists on film. It's not that Burton's film is totally awful. It looks nice and is occasionally amusing. However, it has little or no reason to exist. If Johnny Depp had not been allowed by Burton to make some truly awful acting decisions, the film might have been more watchable. I'm a Depp supporter, but I'll loudly say that he gives the year's worst lead performance. The kids are all pretty good, but the only one who could stand next to her 1971 counterpart would be AnnaSophia Robb as Violet Beauregarde, the gum-chewing champion who turns into a giant blueberry. I also liked the woman who played her mom. The Oompa Loompa songs are crappy, and I really missed some of the other songs from the '71 version (most notably ""I Want It Now"", the original's best scene). One new sequence I did like was Willy Wonka's flashback to when he found the Oompa Loompas. Most of the rest of it is worthless."

Maybe it's just that the original is Sooo phenomenal, but I don't think that that's the case. This movie stands on its own in its crumminess. Mere words cannot convey how bad it was.

The movie is at the very least, weird! The score chosen for the film is wacky and seems like it was contrived overnight. Mr. Chocolate Brain Wonka behaves so weird that you might wonder if he is a pedophile or sociopath. Michael Jackson will certainly come to mind for many of you, I'm sure. The Chocolate Factory itself is like some sort of theme park. All the whole, the film is weird story that seems like it was written overnight and should only be viewed as a form of punishment.

This much slicker and overall better version makes a few fatal mistakes and collapses with 15 minutes left.<br/><br/>I guess having our current Weirdo Wonder Boy in a role as an eccentric recluse makes any harm done to the overall story justifiable. Therefore, we have a ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" in which Charlie isn't even the main character.<br/><br/>In fact, to call Charlie a character at all would be a major embellishment. Our Charlie starts the film as the Perfect Little English Boy and end exactly as he began. He has nothing to learn from Willy Wonka or anyone else for that matter.<br/><br/>The only story arc belongs to good old Willy. I enjoyed Depp's performance for the most part but I kept waiting for the other shoe to drop, for him to tell us something worth hearing. The movie is ultimately a failure because he has nothing to tell us. He's a nut, nothing more.<br/><br/>The only point the movie has is made painfully obvious 10 minutes in, everything else is pure eye candy."
"kerilee","5","2","8","16 July 2005"," Tim Burton's brilliant, but Johnny Depp betrays
","Tim Burton's take on Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is brilliant, and a betrayal, all at the same time. I read the book at least 20 times when I was a kid -- loved it. Tim Burton brought this story to life in a way I never imagined -- or rather -- exactly as I imagined in my head so many times as a kid. While I love the 1971 version for what it was, I was extremely disappointed in the perversion of the characters of Charlie and Grandpa Joe, who would never have thought of doing naughty things in Willy Wonka's factory. That's all fixed in this version, and the visualization here is fantastic. It's dead-on. So dead-on, and so perfect -- except for one very important thing, which is very very very wrong, and so wrong it's almost criminal. And that is Johnny Depp's portrayal of Willy Wonka.<br/><br/>Wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong. The person portrayed here was not even close to channeling the spirit of Wonka. The character is certainly more eccentric and even dark than Gene Wilder's 1971 version. But Willy Wonka is not fey. He is not a creepy Michael Jackson wannabe. He's not a shut-in. And he doesn't need a back story. I'm so utterly disappointed, and it makes me sad, because I want to love this movie. True fans of the book (not the 1971 movie) will know what I'm talking about.<br/><br/>I'm not saying movies have to be carbon copies of the literature they portray. The Lord of the Rings trilogy's deviations from the text are great examples of how extrapolation can be wonderful, and Chris Columbus' original takes on Harry Potter show how strict adherence to a book can actually dampen a movie. However, in this case, it is essential Willy Wonka be portrayed in a much more respectful way than Depp's cheap knock-off of Michael Jackson and Carol Channing.<br/><br/>And I'm a huge Depp and Burton fan.<br/><br/>Sigh. Ten stars for everything but Johnny Depp. Zero stars for Johnny."

I was mildly entertained but nothing really was all that amazing. Depp did an OK job (he never once reminded me of Michael Jackson as some reviewers have commented), and Burton's visual style is evident from the opening credits. Freddy Highmore was very good although he didn't really have all that much to do. The rest of the cast seemed to work OK. I hated the musical numbers.<br/><br/>In the end the story doesn't really work for me. I don't think any version would ever rate higher than 6 on my scale..."

"snowfre","7","1","3","15 April 2020"," Not as colorful as one might wish, but still an imaginary movie
","""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" by Roald Dahl was one of my - and many others - favorite books during the childhood. The story of poor Charlie Bucket who gets invited to Willy Wonka's mysterious but wonderful chocolate factory must be every kid's dream. The book has been made into a film before in the 1970s, with Gene Wilder starring as the chocolatier, a movie that has survived to this day partly with help of internet memes. When Tim Burton decided to adapt Dahl's classic, he teamed up with longtime collaborator Johnny Depp who got to play Willy Wonka alongside a young Freddie Highmore. They both play their parts splendidly and there is nothing negative to say about the rest of the cast that also includes famous names such as David Kelly, Christopher Lee, and Helena Bonham Carter. Burton's archetypical design is present throughout the film, resulting in marvelous settings and surroundings, ranging from chocolate rivers, mountains, and forests. However, with the Burtonesque environments comes a form of bare, cold, emptiness. Not that the chocolate factory's many rooms lack colors, but because that is what we can expect from Burton; always a darkness attached. In terms of storyline, it is most obviously represented through the flashbacks of Wonka's estranged relationship to his father, more so than the sometimes brutal fates the spoiled children faces in the factory. The youngest viewer will most certainly feel the lack of warmth in this version of ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"", but there are enjoyable moments for them to. Deep Roy's portrayal of the thousands of Oompa-Loompas are incredibly funny and the performances of the musical, nicely written by Danny Elfman, are show stopping. Tim Burton's ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" is an interesting adaption of the beloved children's book, though the longer you watch the film, the departure from the original story becomes clearer and the lack of warmth is missed out on. Johnny Depp's awkwardly take of Wonka is however something to hail."

","Opening with a beautifully orchestrated score by Danny Elfman and narration by Geoffrey Holder, Burton's version of the classic story by Roald Dahl is a match made in heaven. There is naturally always going to be comparisons made between this one and the legendary 1971 version starring Gene Wilder and Peter Ostrum, but they are made in very different styles. Here we have the musical aspect still intact provided by the Oompa Loompas (played brilliantly by Deep Roy!) and there are just as memorable original sequences here rather than replicas of the 70s musical numbers which is a wise move. It's very much a faithful adaptation of the book just as the original was and also expands upon it. The thing that makes this version stand out is the fleshing out of Wonka's backstory; why did Willy cast himself out and isolate himself from the outside world and where did his confectionary genius develop? These ideas are explored really well by screenwriter John August and Burton's and Depp's imaginations put together. Johnny Depp is just great as Wonka and produces a really eccentric, slightly creepy and darkly comic performance that taps into the more insecure side of Willy's psyche. The entire cast are great from the wonderful Freddie Highmore as Charlie, David Kelly as Grandpa Joe, all the kids and Christopher Lee as Wilbur Wonka. I remember loving the way it played with expectations upon first watch; from Wonka's seemingly random flashbacks to the offbeat interactions between in characters within the factory.

But seriously Tim Burton's takes on the chocolate factory is refreshing with Burton style and a good adaptation of a book by Roald Dahl. For first up, it starts with a right title and Johnny Depp is way closer to the young crazy chocolate maker we saw in the book. Even the musical parts have been kept( Burton definitely had a very big part in it) and see Charlies uncle Joe as a old skinny guy is definitely a right thing. Of course there is the thing with flashbacks. Burton has a very unique style of storytelling that is no surprise that we see something very much outside the source material come along.

","Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (2005): Dir: Tim Burton / Cast: Johnny Depp, David Kelly, Helena Bonham Carter, Noah Taylor, Freddie Highmore: Chocolate always brings feelings of love, enchantment and imagination and five children are given opportunity to tour the chocolate factory after finding the five golden tickets. Charlie lives in a poverty stricken environment yet the family is content, but the other children are mere types that inhabit repetition and are cursed for their bad behaviour. Director Tim Burton creates a magical fantasy land of chocolate. He has worked with Johnny Depp throughout several film projects such as Ed Wood and Sleepy Hollow. Depp is fantastic as Willy Wonka whose factory was closed to the public when his secrets were being stolen. He is given a back story that underlines a lesson. Of the supporting roles only David Kelly as Charlie's grandfather succeeds above an otherwise limited role. Helena Bonham Carter as Charlie's mother, and Noah Taylor as his father are underused and cardboard. Freddie Highmore plays the title mentioned Charlie who meets his hearts delight in the form of family. Updated version of 1971 classic Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory. It still sustains its lessons of family and discipline as well as an interesting side note regarding teeth care. It is a visual treat of fantasy and magic. Score: 7 ½ / 10"

","Tim Burton's Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is the second adaptation of Roald Dahl's novel Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. The first one being David Wolper's Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory. This adaptation, unlike the 1971 version, is much darker and more true to the book.<br/><br/>Like any Burton production, the visuals are stunning, weird, and just straight-up pleasant. In fact, this is probably Burton's sanest piece of work. It features a... moderately realistic scenario.<br/><br/>Only one guy plays the several hundred Oompa Loompas: Deep Roy. He does a very good job on being the Oompa Loompas. The songs they sing are catchy, memorable, and certainly pleasant on the ear. Some changes from the book were made in this movie too: Mike Teavee is addicted to video games now. That's all I can tell.<br/><br/>There are many flaws in this movie, I must say. I think the story and pictures are a little bit too dark for me. The characters aren't as likable as the 1971 version, and I think it was kinda dumb that Willy Wonka's back story is shown much more than Charlie's antics. Speaking of which, Charlie just isn't good in this movie. I'm sure Freddie Highmore does great acting skills, but this one he was just kind of flawed. Same has to the be said for Johnny Depp, who plays Willy Wonka. The Wonka character isn't as sweet or sarcastic as the 1971 version. Again, I'm sure he was like he is in this movie in the book, but I've never read the book. I can't say I found this movie to be bad, but it's just not as good as the 1971 classic.

It's just all round a fantastic film, apart from...the umper lumper's...they are terrible incarnations of the mini men compared to the first movies realisation of them. I have mentioned the score of the movie was great, but unfortunately that's not the case in relation to the umper lumper's. The songs sung by the aforementioned mini men were pure disaster zones: I only found one of the tunes mildly engaging and that was the number which played out after the 'spoilt' little 'rich girl' fell into the garbage shoot. Other than that, they were all uninspiring, dull, cheesy and sounded cheap.<br/><br/>Anyway, back to the good points about this film; the dialogue, the kids, Charlie's family, the acting and most of all Willy Wonka himself. From the ghastly gasp he takes when a child tries to hugs him to the quick witted irony of the statement, ""your weird"" which he directs towards the 'spoilt' girl's father. Each nuanced flinch and disgusted glance from Willy Wonka aka the brilliant Johnny Depp, simply brought this enchanted fairytale to life and gave the movie real gravitas. <br/><br/>So, to conclude, Depps dope, the kids kick ass and Tim Burton basically bags another bright, bold and beautiful nod from me for a truly genius film."

","Roald Dahl's timeless piece ran through Tim Burtons hands...yes, I'll take it. <br/><br/>Starting from the beginning, the filming is scrumptious and interesting. For a candy-lover like me, this movie is very fun watching, from the candy-point of view. What made the film cool, has maybe to do with the original settings which Dahl has described in the book, about the chocolate room and the Oompa loompas. Your imagination comes to life on screen. <br/><br/>The actors all do a fairly good job, though some personalities differing a bit from the original book. But I consider the film an interpretation of the book, not an exact narrative. Johnny Depp creates his Willy Wonka maybe a bit more emotional and absent-minded than expected, but do to the little side plot about Wonkas childhood put in alongside the main story line, it's well understood.<br/><br/>The little Charlie is innocent and obliging as ever, and his family is likable as well. As for the other children, it was fun watching them being liquidated one by one, only to see them in the end as changed children (if not mentally, then physically). <br/><br/>Well recommended for the whole family."

","""What wonders await you in Willy Wonka's factory?"" asks the film's synopsis, ""You'll find a lot that's funny, a little that's mysterious and an adventure as sweet as a satisfying as a Wonka Whipple-Scrumptious Fudgemallow Delight bar. This dazzling film adapted from Roald Dahl's classic children's novel, directed by Tim Burton and starring Johnny Depp and Freddie Highmore, is your Golden Ticket to a world so inventive, so imaginative, you won't want to miss a delicious moment!"" <br/><br/>In the film, Mr. Depp (as Willy Wonka) explains it in one sentence: ""I invited five children to the factory,"" through the Golden Ticket contest covered early in the running time, ""and the one who was the least rotten would be the winner."" You'll see four VERY rotten children, and super-sweet young Highmore (as Charlie Bucket). They are accompanied by four dysfunctional parents, and Highmore's wise old grandpa David Kelly (as Joe). So, you know who the winner will be, but not the prize.<br/><br/>There was, of course, another film made from this material, ""Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory"" (1971), starring Gene Wilder. It's really a shame nobody thought about doing a version with Paul Reubens in the title role, but that's beside the point. Both the 1971 version and this one are excellent in their own way. Mr. Burton and his frequent co-star add some background (childhood) information about Wonka that isn't in the original work. The effort to add something distinct is appreciated.<br/><br/>The earlier film's sly winking at the contemporary drug counterculture is retained. Depp introduces himself with, ""Good Morning Starshine, the Earth says hello,"" which quotes one of the hit songs from ""Hair"" (the play celebrating sex, drugs, and rock 'n' roll). When Depp walks into a glass door, he says, ""I'm sorry, I was having a flashback."" He wears a Mad Hat, and parodies the facial expressions of Greta Garbo and several old-time movie queens. You twinkle above us, we twinkle below...<br/><br/>By the way, the scene where Depp goes through decades of cultural slang, when explaining a hair tonic to his befuddled factory guests, offers a great visual explanation, after all these years, for ""Cousin Itt"". Deep Roy and the effects are outstanding. It's very entertaining.<br/><br/>******** Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (7/10/05) Tim Burton ~ Johnny Depp, Freddie Highmore, David Kelly, Deep Roy"
"Aaron1375","8","1","3","6 September 2009"," Surprisingly I liked it better than the original.
","I would say I do not know why, but I do, Johnny Depp does a very good job as Willy Wonka, even better than Gene Wilder who did a good job himself. The plot is actually better and does not take that bizarre dark twist here and there like the boat ride through hell, or the strange man trying to get the secret recipe. In fact, at the end of this one Willy does all he can to try to get Charlie to take over his family. I also like that you did not get left in the dark about what happened to all the other kids that happened to be on the tour. Another thing is Christopher Lee has a short, but very good stint in the film as Willy's dad. Funny how Depp played a movie with not one, but two horror screen legends during his career, Lee in this one and Vincent Price in Edward Scissorhands. The story has some of the same story elements here, but there are enough differences to really keep it fresh and interesting. You actually get to see Willy's time in the strange forest where he first gazed upon the ompa loomps and those guys are not as creepy this time around. So be prepared for a bit the same, but a lot of nice differences."

","In the movie Charlie and the Chocolate Factory five ordinary kids get the once and a lifetime opportunity to visit Willie Wonka's(Johnny Depp) candy factory. These five kids are Charlie Bucket, Violet Bourigard, Mike T.V., Veruca Salt and Agustace Gloop. These children are all brats and greedy all that they want is the special prize at the end all but one. This crazy insane tour lead by Mr. Willie Wonka is laugh out loud funny. The best parts though are when the oompa loompas sing the funniest songs in the world! Fallow this tour as things go unplanned. I loved this movie since I first saw it in the theaters and I know the whole movie by heart but it never gets old. I think that it is the best movie in the world. This is a movie that the whole family will enjoy. There is something that everyone in the whole family will love.

","Frankly, I liked the original movie better, but this one's good, and more true to the book (to a point). I thought Wonka was scary, and I knew those weren't his real teeth. Some of the songs scared me, but those I laughed at the most. (""Willy Wonka:The Amazing Chocolatier""; ""Veruca Salt""). They should've put in the thing where Charlie and Grandpa Joe go up the bubble thingy, and the part with the lickable wallpaper. The graphics were better than the original, at least in the chocolate room. Deep Roy was good as the Oompa-Loompas, but the ones from the original were better, and so were the songs. I thought Mike Teavee was a bit too rude in this movie, as well as Augustus Gloop. They weren't that rude in the original.

"mentalcritic","9","1","3","23 March 2007"," Burton delivers once again
","If you consider being made to sit in the school library and watch the 1971 adaptation of Charlie And The Chocolate Factory starring Gene Wilder a happy memory, this film is not for you. No, in making Charlie And The Chocolate Factory, Tim Burton goes back to what he does best, making films for people who share his refined sense of individuality, and in so doing makes something that would not have author Roald Dahl turning his back on the film industry. The difference is in respect for the audience. Willy Wonka (henceforth, WWATCF) presumed that by selling only to the four year olds in the audience, it could make a quick buck. Yet those who rubbish CATCF want you to believe it is nothing but a cynical exercise in making cash. Can we say ""hypocrisy"", boys and girls? Anyway, Burton sets himself apart from other adapters of existing source material in the same manner he accomplished this on 1989's Batman. Namely, by taking the saccharine pump and not only reducing its output, but switching the damned thing off altogether.<br/><br/>Key to this approach of saccharine-free film-making is the cast. Much has already been said of Depp's performance as the famed chocolatier, so more on him anon. The real pleasant surprise here is in the support cast. Arguably the most pleasant surprise of all is David Kelly in the role of Grandpa Joe. Rather than adopt the ""oldie knows best"" routine that comes as a spit in the face to everyone on the same spectrum that Helena Bonham Carter is convinced Tim is on, Kelly portrays Grandpa Joe as a demure, helpful guardian who is simply there to keep Charlie out of harm's way. He is more akin to the real Doctor Who here than what those of us who grew up in the 1980s expect from a ""children's story"". And while her part is small, Helena Bonham Carter is no slouch in the acting department, either. Putting on the affect of a woman who lives in what appears to be a one-room house with six other people is no easy task for someone who is not really living it, so she deserves credit for playing the part so well.<br/><br/>But the biggest surprise in the film by far is Deep Roy as the entire Oompa Loompa tribe. Rather than simply present them as caricatures that are seemingly designed to induce nausea, Burton and Roy create the illusion that Wonka really found them in the heart of a great jungle and made a deal with them fairly typical of the time in which the novel was written. While they certainly all appear similar, there is a sense of individuality about them that the 1971 film could not have achieved had it hired the entire population of Australia as extras. But the real gem in Burton's film is one shared with Edward Scissorhands and Ed Wood. Namely, a former television poster boy by the name of Johnny Depp. Just as Depp's acting provides the heart and soul of either man named Ed, his acting here is what makes Willy Wonka seem three-dimensional. Forget the nauseating, vapid anthem about what the candyman can do, Depp makes it plainly obvious, as Dahl likely intended, that what the candyman cannot do is far more important.<br/><br/>Roald Dahl once said that the formula behind his success as a children's story author was conspiring with children against adults. Burton follows this formula like a roadmap, as the introduction of the four children Charlie embarks on the tour with makes clear. While the casual viewer will walk away thinking of the children as monsters, the clear message of the story is that these children would be very different indeed if their parents behaved differently. It is a story that, unfortunately, parents of the real world never quite seem to learn the lesson from as youngsters are sent to face the world with inadequate education, training, or even logic. If you really believe that Charlie is not an indictment upon parenting flaws taken to their logical extreme, then take note of how every child in the film is a replica to a disturbing degree of their parents. Just as Charlie mirrors his parents' patient, passive nature, his four companions on the tour mirror their parents' lack of will, hygiene, or intelligence. It is a terrible shame Roald Dahl did not live to see this film made, for I suspect he would have quite enjoyed seeing that someone in Hollywood finally ""got it"".<br/><br/>If I did have to state a complaint about the film, it would be that the story seems a little off the pace. Scenes designed to explain Willy Wonka's immense interest in the manufacture of sweet consumables slow the story to a crawl, in spite of masterful performances by Christopher Lee. Fortunately, they add up to a payoff with Depp and Lee portraying the reconciling father and son in the manner of two great professionals. The only other problem is that the mostly-CGI sets give the film an unreal, artificial sheen that, while preferable to the Play School style of sets seen in the 1971 film, gets a little hard on the eyes after a while. Not that I normally have a problem with CGI, but we all have our limits as to when a good thing becomes too much. The scene with Charlie's companions leaving the chocolate factory in various warped forms after suffering the consequences of their inability to respect Wonka's house rules is somewhat difficult to watch for this reason. It does not look fake, per se, it is just disturbing to look at, which I am not sure was the intention.<br/><br/>All in all, Charlie And The Chocolate Factory circa 2005 is a nine out of ten film. If you enjoy seeing people who talk to children as if they have an IQ to match their age getting slapped in the face, this film is for you."
"charchuk","4","1","3","15 March 2007"," A good film that could have been great
","Kind of a disappointment. All the ingredients were there for this to be a great film: classic source material, visionary direction, great star. I guess where it fell flat was in the script. It's got a few moments of great dark humour, but much of it was too light and fluffy; I guess it is a kid's film, but the original film was much darker. Also, it ignores Charlie for a large portion in the middle, focusing on Wonka, and then allows him to win by default. There's no sense that he did anything right - he just kept his mouth shut and won the prize. And the father subplot really doesn't work. Still, it's not a bad film. The visuals are great, and Depp's performance, while hit-and-miss at times, is pretty funny. The acting is good all-around, the direction is fun, and the music didn't really bother me. Neither did the Oompa Loompas. The musical numbers felt a bit out of place, but the songs were decent. Overall, a good film that could have been great."

","Charlie and the Chocolate Facory is just an an and all strange movie. The movie, which stars the amazing Freddie Highmore as the titular Charlie, and Johnny Depp as the haunting Willie Wonka. This Wonka is surely different from Gene Wilder's, For one, Depp is a much much darker version of the Wonka character. As a matter of fact, I kept comparing him to Michael Jackson, whenever he was on screen. Obsessed with little people, total disdain for adults, and in his own dreamworld. I don't know, because of this, I was just slightly creeped out by this and really couldn't get into the movie as much as I should have. But, I REALLY loved the first part of the movie, with Charlie's life and the discovery of the gold tickets and what not, it's just when we get to the factory, it sort of goes off for me."

Gone was the horrific chicken be-heading scene in the tunnel, and this time the oompa-loompas were not scary at all.<br/><br/>I thought Johnny Depp was very good in the role and, in my opinion, his casting for the part was a good choice.<br/><br/>I enjoyed Deep Roy's interpretation of the oompa-loompas, I had seen him act before in Doctor Who's ""Talons of Weng-Chiang"" as the sinister Mr.Syn. I also liked the idea that he was much smaller than the oompa-loompas in the original film and I was pleased to see an explanation was given how Wonka managed to acquire them from the jungle.<br/><br/>The effects were great too, and I thought the music numbers were a good giggle as well.<br/><br/>The German kid did make me feel sick with the chocolate all over his face and I was somewhat pleased when he fell in the river and got sucked up.<br/><br/>I must say though that I was very disappointed with the ending, it seemed all very sad to me.<br/><br/>Although the original version of this film scared the hell out of me, I would still say that the original was the better of the two versions made.

"bruce-collingwood","5","1","3","13 February 2006"," A real disappointment
","The test of a really great film is whether you still enjoy it after you've watched it ten times with the kids. Tim Burton's film version of ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"", like eating too many Wonka bars, has left me with a slightly sick feeling in my stomach.<br/><br/>I'm a big a fan of the original film (called ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"" to the annoyance of Roald Dahl) and so was hugely looking forward to taking the kids to see the remake. However even the advent of CGI and a multi-million dollar budget couldn't disguise the fact that Burton has added very little - somehow the magic, comedy and grotesqueness of the original were lost .<br/><br/>To me the main characters are far more 2 dimensional and the cloning of a middle aged Asian man as the Oompa Loompas didn't really do it for me. Charlie (who usually looses a parent or two in his other films) was far too grumpy. I might leave him my funeral home but certainly not my Chocolate factory.<br/><br/>The Christoper Lee back story was the one improvement however I still pine for the original."
"royale_w_cheez44","9","1","3","14 January 2006"," What you'd expect from Tim Burton and Johnny Depp
","Instantly when this film was released everyone was comparing it to the musical ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"" released in 1971. Well to tell the truth, this version really ISN'T a remake. After all, it was based solely on the book, and the screen writer never even saw the 1971 musical. That being said, ""Charlie"" sticks much closer to its source material and, in the end, is a better movie. Yes, ""Willy Wonka"" has a tremendous amount of sentimental value for me, and Gene Wilder gave a twisted performance, but ""Charlie"" has much more heart and is visually amazing.<br/><br/>The new title of ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" instead of ""Willy Wonka"" really makes it evident of who this movie really is about: Charlie. Freddie Highmore plays Charlie with such honesty, he is a really endearing character and a truly selfless person. Much of the film's charm really comes from the heart that Freddie Highmore puts in to his performance. He really has quite a career ahead oh him.<br/><br/>I know that a lot of people had a complaint about the Oompa Loompas, like how they ""didn't sing the Oompa-Loompa songs like in the old one!"" Well actually the songs in the movie contain actual lyrics in the book, and the songs are pretty catchy in a weird and kind of annoying way. And it's really great to get a look at the Oompa Loompa's origins and Wonka's childhood and background.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp is energetic and he simply demands to be seen, as always. He gives a hilarious and wild performance as Wonka, although a far cry from Gene Wilder's psycho maniac Wonka. He is really convincing in the way that he really has no social skills and can't interact with people. And another thing I liked about this film over ""Willy Wonka"" was the connection between Charlie and Wonka. In the ""Willy Wonka"", they really show no connection until the end, which by itself is pretty abrupt. However, you can tell that there's real bond that forms between these two from the start, and it works out much better.<br/><br/>Visually the movie is a miracle. It steps up from the 1971 musical in terms of color and style, and it has a very vibrant and imaginative look to it. Granted, some of the visual effects look like crap, but the overall experience is a wonder.<br/><br/>""Charlie"" ranks right up there with some of Tim Burton's best films, such as Edward Scissorhands or Big Fish. It's visual flair and big, big heart is irresistible and hugely entertaining. I would recommend this for anyone who even liked ""Willy Wonka"", or anyone who likes Roald Dahl and his twisted imagination. This is a movie with tons of laughs and a lot of charm, so it really stands out as one of the best family movies in recent memory. Absolutely superb."

I do not recommend this movie to anybody. The only reason I award this movie 4 stars (3 higher than it should be), is because I have to concede that yes this is a children's film, and yes, children would like it, but really, from all the adults that I have heard wonderful things about this movie from, I think they should know better.

WW have been isolated in the factory for 15 years from the outside world, if you don't get any sun, your skin will go pale like WW, that is why he looks so creepy looking from 15 years of isolation.

"CraigHamrick","3","1","3","2 December 2005"," Blueberry scene one of the most disappointing....
","Charlie and the Chocolate Factory has a few interesting visual moments, but overall it's one of the biggest disappointments of 2005. It seems to me that Tim Burton did a lot of things in this movie because he could -- not necessarily because it was it made the overall film better. One particular scene sums up what I found most unlikable: Violet's transformation into a giant blueberry. Just because CGI technology made it possible to make Violet swell to gigantic proportions, that's no reason to do it. In the original Willy Wonka film, it was clear that even as Violet grew, she was still portrayed by a real little girl (Denise Nickerson). In this version, within moments after the transformation begins, we're looking at a cartoon character -- and not a particularly convincing one at that. The original film had scary moments, because even if you disliked the naughty children, you likely felt some compassion when they were in peril. In this version, I didn't care whether the cartoonish kids were in danger or not. The whole film suffers from this problem -- it has no heart. (Another example is the emotionless, unattractive Oompa Loompas. Bleh. And the creepy back story about Willy's dentist father...those flashbacks only served to pull us out of the factory and certainly didn't make Wonka any more likable.) I thought Tim Burton had hit an all-time career low when he mangled Planet of the Apes. But his work on CATCF is even worse. Most of his original work, like Edward Scissorhands, is great, but I hope he keeps his hands off any more classic films."
"Sam B","6","1","3","20 November 2005"," Now here's a movie that did NOT need to be re-made.
","Granted that the 1971 classic had poor special effects and bad make-up, the advances in technology did not advance the cause of the story -- it just made it weird-looking. The 1971 version had characters that were likable or dislikable. In 2005, the characters were almost all despicable, except of course for one... who was infallibly perfect. In 1971, Charlie did commit a sin (he stole) which made him more human. It was his act of contrition that made him truly lovable. On the other hand, in 2005, we do get glimpses into what made Wonka into the man he is today.<br/><br/>The music? How can you teach a lesson when you can't even make out the words?? In 1971, every child came out of the theater singing the lyrics. 2005's over-orchestration made that impossible.<br/><br/>And by the way, why were hundreds of miniaturized Joe Pescis employed to make this film when thousands of midget-actors are out of work??<br/><br/>Note to Tim Burton: if you're going to use special effects, get the lighting right! Otherwise it's just a distraction that hurts my eyes.<br/><br/>The 2005 ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" is a movie, I guess, you have to see once. The 1971 ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"" is a movie you'll want to see many times."

I only listened to the ad on TV which made absolutely no distinction to two versions. The two disc version has the extras about the squirrels, the one-disc version does not.

Freddy Highmore is very good as Charlie Bucket and I expect him to have a beautiful movie career. All the other actors are great too.

But the biggest show stealer of this film has to Deep Roy who deserves a lot of respect for playing ALL the Oompa Loopa's.

The only things I really liked were Gene Wilder, a genius I new from Blazing Saddles and Young Frankenstien, and also some of the great one-liners. <br/><br/>This one rocked my socks. Charlie was perfect, the other kids were absolutely despicable, and the visuals were amazing. The oompa loompas were much more faithful to the book and their songs were hilarious if hard to understand. But I listen to Tom Waits (probably the only twelve-year-old girl to do so), so I'm used to that.<br/><br/>Wonka deserves special mentions. Johnny Depp made him a socially awkward, crazy, hilarious freak with deep emotional wounds and some really brilliant dialog. This film added a back story on Willy, which I love. As a child, Willy was held from his dreams by his overprotective dentist father, played by Christopher Lee, an amazingly cool and creepy actor. During the first flashback we see, I was pressed back in my chair in terror.<br/><br/>Willy misunderstands his father's behavior, believing that he hated his son rather than loved him. He therefor assumes that this is the case with all parents. And when he tells Charlie he can't bring his parents to the factory, thinking he's doing the kid a favour, Charlie's well-acted rage shocks and wounds him. This rejection, and his father's memory, continue to haunt him over the next while. He briefly loses all candy skill, and requires therapy to figure out why( it's because he feels guilty).<br/><br/>He eventually seeks out Charlie for help, and the boy explains what Willy has got wrong and gives him he emotional support necessary to confront his father and learn the truth. <br/><br/>I can't help but wonder what would have happened if when Charlie found out he was serving Wonka and asked him, ""Why are you here?"" in steely tones, Willy had answered, ""Getting a shine. Duh.""<br/><br/>Incidentally, I've done my best to figure it out, and I'd say Willy is about 47. After all, in the flashback from the point of view of grandpa Joe, it's 20 years ago and Willy is at least 25. <br/><br/>Definitely see this film. It's a real treat!"

","Boy, was I ever wrong when I first judged what little I saw of Johnny Depp's (Pirates of the Caribbean, Finding Neverland) portrayal of Willy Wonka in the previews for this film. Even though it was different from Gene Wilder's portrayal in the 1971 version (titled Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory), Depp ends up giving one of the most enjoyable and funny performances of his career. Because of director Tim Burton's (Sleepy Hollow, Big Fish) outstanding reputation in working with Depp, it allowed for Depp to be able to deliver a gratifying spin on Wonka's character that truly captivates the audience. Add to that the fact that it stays much closer to the book by Roald Dahl, and you've got something that'll last forever.<br/><br/>In the film, Freddie Highmore (Finding Neverland) plays Charlie Bucket, an innocent and selfless boy who lives in a little old lopsided house with his parents and grandparents from both sides of the family. They're so impoverished that they only have enough money to buy him one Wonka chocolate bar once a year for his birthday. So when Willy Wonka decides to give out five golden tickets wrapped inside of five Wonka bars scattered throughout the world for a tour of his secret chocolate factory, Charlie looks forward to his next birthday more than any of the others before it.<br/><br/>After getting chocolate for his birthday, and Grandpa Joe (played by David Kelly of Waking Ned Devine) coughing up dough for another - Charlie, while grateful for the chocolate, does not get a golden ticket. As three times is usually a charm, Charlie finds a ten dollar bill in the snow and buys one more chocolate bar and ends up being the last child in the world to find a golden ticket. Along with snobby rich girl Veruca Salt (Julia Winter), German choc-o-holic Augustus Gloop (Philip Wiegratz), smart-mouth Mike Teavee (Jordan Fry) and gum-chewing champion Violet Beauregarde (Annasophia Robb) - Charlie enters the factory with the four other lucky, but undeserving winners. Little do they know what wonders (and dangers) lie ahead - let alone how fun it is for the audience to enjoy it all.<br/><br/>While the visuals in the Gene Wilder version were great for the time, we're treated to a much bigger and more epic version of the factory in this film. Updated with modern CGI and effects, we're given greater visuals of such things as optical illusions, a flying glass elevator that can go any direction, vast passageways, chocolate waterfalls, eatable landscapes, trained squirrels, and even ""Fudge Mountain"" (literally the size of a real mountain that lies underneath a real sky contained within the factory somehow).<br/><br/>This film shows us that Willy Wonka's chocolate factory is not constrained by the various laws of reality. It's a fantasy world that's isolated from the outside world - which is sort of a skewed reality in and of itself, with such things as Wonka building a chocolate palace overseas, or the existence of ""Loompa Land"" and its strange little inhabitants. Burton directs the picture so that we just accept the reality in which we're given, and that's what makes this film work.<br/><br/>The Oompa Loompas, who work for Wonka in exchange for wages consisting of coca-beans, are a delight to observe. They're all played by one man (Deep Roy), an already vertically-challenged actor who is digitally duplicated and shrunk to look extra tiny for the film. The Oompa Loompas treat us to wonderfully humorous and witty musical numbers that make us giggle with glee. Who would've thought that Roy, who played a quiet circus performer in Big Fish, could be so funny, imitating various ""Esther Williams"" swimming moves, or mimicking rock bands like The Beatles and Kiss. This is by far the most entertaining aspect of the film.<br/><br/>Thanks to a wonderfully adapted screenplay by John August (Big Fish), this version gives us not only an updated look for the story and funny Oompa Loompas, but also provides an amusing back story of Wonka and the factory, and insight as to why Willy Wonka is sort of two fries short of a Happy Meal. Willy Wonka is a seriously disturbed individual in this film, socially awkward and kind of rude. But while Gene Wilder simply was the way he was in the 1971 film without any explanation, this one actually goes deep into Wonka's childhood and his relationship with his father (played by Christopher Lee of The Lord of the Rings and Star Wars series) and gives us an explanation. This ultimately paves the way for a beautiful ending in which Wonka actually learns a valuable lesson from Charlie.<br/><br/>Not much fault can be found with the film. It may err a bit in that while titled ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,"" the story tends to shift focus much more onto Willy Wonka's character journey than on Charlie's. While I can't say if that's closer to the book, it is such an intriguing journey that audiences really don't seem to mind. Johnny Depp is always a pleasure to watch in any film he's in, so we just have grown accustomed to him being in the spotlight. And perhaps Charlie, while still a kid, has already been on the journey because of his excursion through poverty and it's now his turn to help someone else in need.<br/><br/>Does it top the original? In many ways, yes it does. It's much closer to the book according to Burton, and now we know why Willy Wonka is so loopy. Johnny Depp delivers one of the funniest performances of his career, and just like in Finding Neverland, he and Freddie Highmore have great chemistry together on screen. This movie is a treat for all ages - one that is funny and entertaining and stands above the original film as yet another great cinematic achievement for Tim Burton."
"Sidpeeper","10","1","3","23 September 2005"," A sugar-coated film for the whole family
","When it comes to the fantastic trio of Tim Burton, Johnny Depp, and Danny Elfman, the movie is bound to be wonderful one, as with Charlie and the chocolate factory. Though the Depp's Wonka is a little different then the original book one, he's still a great and intriguing character, and the film even has insights about his past and such to give him a reason to be so odd and to have his quirks. Dotted with well placed and unique humor, this film will keep you giggling, snorting, chuckling, and smiling through the whole film. Though Depp's Wonka can be a little creepy, and even a little nuts, he's still a wonderful and unique character to enjoy. The music for this film is also great. It helps set the mood, and, the Oompa-Loompas' songs have a new spin to them, and I simply cannot get the songs out of my head. I give this film an A+, a Ten out of Ten, a thumbs up, or anything else you can think of to say its great. It is personally my favorite movie, and will forever leave a lasting and cheerful impression on me for time to come."
"baktakor","10","1","3","22 September 2005"," Terrific fairy tale with excellent acting and a touch of horror
","I know that most people think that Johnny Depp's best movie was Pirates of the Caribbean. Of course, Pirates was an excellent movie, I think Johnny Depp has outdone all of his previous movies with Charlie and the chocolate factory.<br/><br/>I have to admit that I am European and here, at least here in Austria, the book is not well known and even the older movie is quite rare. So this movie was my first time with the Willy-Wonka-Universe. So I'm not reviewing how well the movie is based on the book or how good it is compared to the older one. The only thing I can review is the movie itself and I need to say that better movies appear very seldom.<br/><br/>From the visual part, there are stunning colors throughout Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. All situations are filled with emotions not only by wonderful actors but by visionary filming too. This is - certainly - a Tim Burton - movie in best tradition of Sleepy Hollow or Nightmare before Christmas. The scene where they first enter the factory and find themselves in this wonderful wonderland with the chocolate-fall is absolutely fantastic. Wonka's cynicism is great. His naive enjoyment of the kids when they run into trouble - always after not following his advice - is unbelievable. An his comforting sentences to the anxious parents are one of the highlights of the movie.<br/><br/>The storyline is quite tense and consists of three major parts with the middle part being the longest. The first part plays with the hopes of the audience and it's main character Charlie, the third part leaves an annoying unsatisfied feeling in the audience that is replaced by laughs and easement in the end. But the middle part is the genius one.<br/><br/>Looking like a colorful fairy-tale, trying to spread good emotions it is a horror flick in its heart. The scene at the beginning with the burning puppets initiates a typical 'group goes in - one by one is lost - one comes out'-theme. How the group is depleted is fantastically weird, so the movie is never horrifying but it is clear that something evil is going on and the songs of the oompa-loompas affirm it.<br/><br/>This movie is absolutely amazing, visually, acoustically and even by the amazing actors. If you don't know it - go watch it!"

","I usually enjoy the partnership Tim Burton + Johnny Depp (""Edward Scissorhands"" is one of my favourite films). This remake of the lovely ""Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory"" (directed by Mel Stuart in 1971, based on Roald Dahl's delightful book), however, was disappointing.<br/><br/>Burton's dark style and adult jokes don't work here. The cynicism he put in almost every scene let the movie with a bitter taste: it's too twisted for children, and too childish for adults.<br/><br/>Freddie Highmore did a fine job as Charlie Bucket (he also worked with Johnny Depp in ""Finding Neverland""). Depp, on the other hand, was extremely mannered as Willy Wonka, light-years away from Gene Wilder's terrific performance in the original (Depp is too much alike Michael Jackson for us to bear - the comparison is inevitable, though Burton says the similarity between them was unintentional). As a friend of mine said, Gene Wilder's Willy Wonka had a golden heart behind all the eccentricity, but Depp's Wonka is just mean and weird. I agree. The new Oompa-Loompas (all of them played by Deep Roy) are boring (their songs suck!) and obnoxious, by the way.<br/><br/>Remakes are definitely not for Burton. ""Planet of the Apes"" and this one are his worst movies that I've seen so far. Skip this: if you want to watch a good Tim Burton movie with your kids, rent ""Big Fish"", ""Beetlejuice"" or ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" (Henry Selick directed it, by it IS a Tim Burton movie! One of the best examples of ""Producer's movie"" - just like David O. Selznick and ""Gone With The Wind"").<br/><br/>My vote: 6 out of 10."

","Well, how can I tell you, I wish Tim Burton himself would read my words in order to say...yes, That was the point or sorry...I never thought about that. But I dare say all parents will find out something so great about being fathers and mothers throughout this film. We are educating kids, but we don't realize they are getting something from us, sometimes it's not our best side, then we either are proud about it or we reject. What I found out is why my son is the way he is!!! Eureka, we, our parents are the same, what are we trying to deny? The fat woman has a fat son, the stupid mother a stupid girl, the sweet grandpa a sweet kid, and there was Mr Wonka, with that terrible relation with his own father... If you don't believe me just think about your friends and his sons... they either are so similar or just the opposite...

"tara_kelly1979","2","1","3","8 September 2005"," If you love the original, you will hate this version
","I have been dreading seeing this movie ever since I heard that it was being remade. I am a huge fan of the Gene Wilder version and still sing along to it when it comes on TV. That will not be happening with this film. There are no catchy tunes in this version, you can't even understand the words never mind want to remember them. I feel sorry for the little children out there who will grow up watching this version and miss out on the cool songs from the original.<br/><br/>I was very distressed by the Oopma Loompas in this film. The sight of Deep Roy replicated thousands of times was not a nice sight. They were not as fun and cute as in the original and as previously mentioned their songs were awful. They ruined the movie for me. Every time they appeared on screen I cringed.<br/><br/>I felt that this version lacked the warmth and humor of the original. Depp's Wonka was cold, childlike and unfriendly. The fact that he refused Charlie's family to live in the factory was bizarre. Nothing like the book or the Wonka character we love. While Depp acted very well I just didn't feel that he was Willy Wonka. I much prefer Wilder's quirky version. You know he has a dark side and is a little insane but you love him, with the Depp version it made you wonder why Willy Wonla would want to open up his factory to children and give it away if he hates everyone so much.<br/><br/>One aspect of the original film that I liked was when we got to see Charlie at school and working on his paper round, you realize that he is a lonely boy with no money and therefore no friends. In the new version, Charlie is never seen anywhere except on one street or in his house, he doesn't talk to anyone except his parents. He doesn't come across as such a sorrowful character as in the original and so you don't really care about him as much.<br/><br/>I will not be watching this again, I will however watch the original thousands of times."

I think people will really like it not just the children but the adults as well. It will be a big hit for the world for a few years until they make another one, I hope...

","STAR RATING: ***** The Works **** Just Misses the Mark *** That Little Bit In Between ** Lagging Behind * The Pits <br/><br/>To any child who ever grew up in Blighty, the tales of Roald Dhal should be as familiar as apple pie. So every child who ever was is likely to be familiar with the tale of Charlie (Freddie Highmore) a young kid with problems in life. His family don't have much and, without even realizing it (or at least not making that much of a fuss about it!) the building contractors have done a really sh!tty job on his house (it's slanting!) and every time a family member enters the house, they address the others by saying 'hello Buckets!) ??? Anyway, Charlie's luck's about to change when eccentric chocolate maker William Wonka (current wonder-kid Johnny Depp) places some shiny tickets in bars of his chocolate brands. Charlie picks the losing ticket at first and has to make do with his no-doubt scrumptuous choccy-bar. But his grand-father's a persistent old fruit and uses his money to buy him another one. This time luck lets him be a lady, and pleasant young Charlie gets sent off to Wonka's factory, with it's mountains of choccy and candy and Oompa Loompas (singing, dancing weirdos in costumes all played by one peculiar actor!) with a load of otherwise snotty brats who need a moral lesson in their lives. And Wonka's just the person to give it.<br/><br/>Through-out the last year or so, I've been trying to get more into children's films. From the age of 16 or so, I'd sort of accepted that I'd grown out of them and focused all my attention on more high-brow, adult orientated stuff. But I started to notice a lot of critics giving rave reviews to a lot of these kiddie flicks, so I gave Finding Nemo a try, no great shakes (in my opinion!) but I followed it up with The Incredibles (which was ace!) earlier in the year. And I remembered a little film called Toy Story, released nearly ten years ago, which I could still appreciate today. So I took it on that giving my time to kids films again wasn't such a bad thing. So I'll try and seek out the Harry Potter films sometime soon (can't believe they're making a fourth film!) And I was glad to have let down my reservations and seen this adaptation by Tim Burton.<br/><br/>Those already familiar with Burton's unique style of filming will find CATCF terra ferma, and so will those coming to experience his unique approach to family films. But despite all the rave reviews, it's undeniable that this is a film with some serious flaws. And these mainly revolve around the lead star. Highmore as Charlie, as the lead star, gets hardly any screen-time but ironically in the scenes he's in, he kind of annoyingly wholesome, brattishly so, even. And as Wonka, you could say Depp is kind of mis-cast, but he is sort of hammy for some parts of the film (although you get the impression he did the best he could with the part!) The supporting cast are quite good, in the shape of Helena Bonham Carter, Christopher Lee and Noah Taylor, through to the more unknown stars. The Oompa-Loompa singing/dancing sequences are also quite well done and have a genuine sort of charm to them.<br/><br/>Overall, I can say this mostly succeeds as a good representation of what fans of Burton's usual work will be expecting, but no matter what everyone else is saying, there are some serious flaws present and it serves as no great notch on Depp's present career high. ***"
"BurtFan","3","1","3","5 September 2005"," Another pointless Tim Burton remake.
","This version adds nothing to the 1971 version, except for a superfluous back-story about Wonka's 'issues' with his dad...Wonka is an enigma, so why did the scriptwriters feel we had to 'understand' him (or is it due to some American fixation with psychoanalysis?)? The original had at least one song which has become a 'standard'('The Candy Man'), yet I was hard-pressed to remember any of the songs in the new version, five minutes after they'd finished. Being able to turn one man into a whole tribe of Oompa Loompas shows how far technology has advanced, but robbed them-literally-of any individuality. On a personal note, coming from the UK, hearing English characters in a film set in England talking about 'candy', 'summer vacation', and brushing mud off their 'pants', really made my teeth grate (and when did the British currency become the dollar!). ...and on a petty note, most people living below the breadline don't speak like members of the upper-classes (I'm talking to you Helena Bonham Carter!)."

He actually doesn't seem to care for some of his own self-created image of the melancholy yet charismatic goof-ball. Instead he decides (or it was decided) that he could play a role similar to Michael Keaton in Beetlejuice ---by that I mean slightly annoying and uncomfortable--- lets not forget some of the common elements of Burton films--- when he is making one for the fans and when he is making one for himself--- i think that this falls in the latter category.<br/><br/>Did i find that this movie was good? Well his modern adaption and the depiction of characters went fairly well but in general it didn't jive all the way with a sense of charm or original material--- most of it was the set/props and the look--- the interactions of the characters was fairly diluted and --- yes there was some good flashback scenes of W.

Each set is as magnificent as the one before it. I really liked the chocolate waterfall, the inventing & television rooms, and the elevator. Burton also succeeded in telling a good story. Sure, the movie is based on one of the best books ever written, but Burton also had his touches like the flashbacks and the trademark dark humor.<br/><br/>Freddie Highmore was great as Charlie. He was totally convincing as the poor boy. You could really feel his sadness when he didn't win the golden ticket in the beginning of the movie. David Kelly, who played Charlie's grandfather was just as good. I'm afraid the same thing can't be said about Johnny Depp. Don't get me wrong, Depp gave a good performance, but as a great fan of him, I was expecting more.<br/><br/>As I said, the movie had some minor flaws. I felt we should have seen more interaction between the 5 kids,they barely spoke to each other during the movie. Also, the songs performed by The Oompa Loompas (Deep Roy) were fun to watch the first couple of times, but after that, they became somewhat boring and predictable. Anyway, you always had the eye-candy to look at during these songs.<br/><br/>So, I'd recommend CatCF, it's one of the best movies of the year."

Of the audience that was with me, 95% were adults, for this is not a children's movie, it is about something that everybody loves...chocolate (I'm sorry if I have spoiled the movie for people).

Good special effects used on them, but again lots of special effects in films aren't always a good thing. Certain points through the films you begin to wonder ""just how tall ARE these oompa loompas"" as throughout the film they appear to be a variety of sizes, although they are intended to be the same person.<br/><br/>Lacks the classic songs that Gene Wilder sings throughout the original, although the new Wonka has a certain darkness about him which is something that the charming smile of Wilder just didn't bring to the original.<br/><br/>Actually quite glad that I don't prefer the new remake to the original, and I feel as though I haven't let Gene down!

"tjcclarke","6","1","3","23 August 2005"," Choccy Horror Show
","Well it's not really that bad, but it's difficult to think of a chocolate-related pun for a review that will hopefully convey a sentiment of adequacy and mild disappointment.<br/><br/>Hmm. Where to begin? I suppose the comparisons with the original 1971 Gene Wilder film are inevitable, so let's get them out of the way quickly: This is better. Marginally. My biggest beef with the original (aside from the rubbish spying sub-plot) was the kid they got to play Charlie  a bouffant-haired, no-mark sycophant, so ludicrously saccharine and brown-nosing, that I would have sooner sawn off my own arm than offer him a controlling stake in my chocolate empire.<br/><br/>No such problems here. Freddie Highmore is an astute piece of casting  he has the Dickensian urchin look down pat. Indeed, the whole Bucket family is steeped in a homely grime that is never quite managed in the more Americanised original.<br/><br/>I think the key to that is Tim Burton's decision to exploit the ambiguity over the setting of the action by making the Buckets English. I'm not sure there is anything in the book clarifying the location of the chocolate factory, or indeed the nationality of Charlie's family (there is talk of ""dollars"" in the film, but enough evidence to suggest an industrial town somewhere in the South of England. Slough maybe. Or maybe not.) It is an important judgement though because the British do poverty and old people so much better than the Americans who tend to be rather too chipper. Give me a bedful of ancient, dotty sitcom stalwarts and Helena Bonham Carter in a floury apron any day.<br/><br/>Whatever, after a promising beginning, the film descends rapidly towards the brown stuff (and I'm not talking about the contents of the chocolate river). The special effects are impressive and diverting, but one would expect nothing less in these days of bells and whistles. But the children are bland and don't lend anything new to the story other than to fuel the debate over the very purpose of remakes. One can only watch a fat kid getting sucked up a glass pipe so many times before ennui sets in.<br/><br/>Much of Burton's film is faithful to the book, but he can't resist an extra plot line reinforcing Dahl's fondness for generational conflict and his deep-seated mistrust of adults. Here, he seeks to explain Wonka's sociophobia by introducing a series of childhood flashbacks where a petrified Willy, his face encased in a fearsome metal contraption, is lectured on the importance of dental hygiene by none other than the Prince of Darkness himself, Christopher Lee, and if that's not enough to send a small child spiralling into a dark world of isolation and illicit confectionery, then I don't know what is.<br/><br/>I guess the key to the whole project was always going to be Johnny Depp, and I'm afraid to say he didn't really do it for me. I can kind of see what he was going for. He's obviously studied the raw material carefully and put his own unique spin on Wonka and, while his performance is undoubtedly a triumph of make-up and gauche comic timing, I was left slightly deflated and not a little alarmed by his striking resemblance to Dave Hill out of Slade.<br/><br/>I'm not suggesting there is an easy way to portray Wonka, but Wilder played him far too knowing and disingenuous, while Depp strives too hard to be the antithesis of adulthood, which, in this climate, and with a forty-year-old actor in the role, is difficult to achieve without drawing uneasy comparisons to Michael Jackson. <br/><br/>I always remembered the actual character to sit neatly between the two  crotchety and misanthropic, but with a childish playfulness that neither screen incarnation truly manages to capture. Also, as I recall, in Quentin Blake's original artwork for the books, Wonka is shown to have a rather rakish goatee beard  a detail studiously ignored by both sets of filmmakers - and I cannot help but conclude that this chin-nudity goes a long way towards explaining the flaws in characterisation.<br/><br/>As for the Oompa Loompas (in this case all played by the amusingly named Deep Roy and electronically duplicated) I will reserve judgement save for saying that both films neatly side-step any awkward racist questions by making them bright orange so that any moral outrage will be confined to Dale Winton and Kat Slater out of Eastenders.<br/><br/>6/10"

","Before seeing this film at the cinema last week I'd heard mixed opinions about it. I had a friend who loved it for the humour and what it was.. and my oh so cynical mother saying how she'd read bad reviews and it probably would be nothing like the book or the original.<br/><br/>NOW this is the one thing I dislike about this movie. The fact that everyone has been comparing it. I must have seen the original umpteen times when I was little, but I'm happy to say I've completely forgotten what it was like! The reason I was so happy about this was because I couldn't compare it, and instead was able to judge the film for what it was and NOT in comparison to the last film or book. The original film wasn't an exact portrayal of the book anyway (in fact is is called WILLY WONKA and the chocolate factory) whereas this is trying to get a little closer to the roald dahl version.<br/><br/>but besides how the story went; I thought the effects and imaginary were amazing, just what I would expect from a director as great as Tim Burton. The film really brought that child like fantasy of the book, with a little of a dark twist. I thought it was extremely humorous, and the acting was brilliant. Johnny Depp is brilliant at bringing out unusual characters, and he gave what i thought was a more realistic approach to what Wonka really would be like, more like a recluse who didn't really want to see any children. The oompa lumpa's are what everyone seems dissatisfied with, probably because they liked the old dwarfs from the original and don't like the fact it was one guy computerised. But he is actually a small guy and I didn't see any problem with them. The songs they sang were verses included in the book, and I thought it was better that they chose to sing them rather than chant them.<br/><br/>The one thing I would knock about the film (only since my mum pointed it out, yes the cynical one..) is they said 'candy' too much. The book is British, I thought charlie and his family were too and it was set in some English town at first..but then they used dollars, and americanisms like 'candy' and 'band aid' ...then other characters seemed American (obviously some like the TV kid were..) but yeah, that some what confused me. I don't know if that was cos it was trying to appeal to an American audience or it was an American screenwriter or I see so many American shows on TV I can't tell the difference between my (british) culture and American culture..... maybe its just me <br/><br/>overall, GREAT!"
"David_Frames","5","1","3","20 August 2005"," Wonka's Shame
","A horrid little film which glorifies one man's interest in side-stepping unionised labour, the human rights act, Industrial practise and creating mass unemployment in a small town while coining it in at the expense of a cheap child-sized workforce imported for overseas. Its an utterly shameful exercise dressed up as children's entertainment and its time it was stopped. So Wonka's the commercial genius with ""the most fabulous chocolate factory in the world"" well fine but not so good for poor Grandpa Joe Bucket who's poor family has to eat cabbage soup in a dilapidated town house with no roof because the old man lost his job without any form of redundancy package because of Industrial espionage in which he had no part to play. Yet the old man reveres Wonka as a wonderful eccentric and confectionery king, how the elderly forget! You don't hear old fleet street mob singing Murdoch's praises after they were replaced by computer software at the Australian American's Wapping plant do you? No, so we bear witness to the classic deference of the British working class - experts at keeping themselves ghettoised throughout the ages, revering the very people that keep them poor and socially-economically impotent. The same impulse that causes people from council estates to shake the hands of royalty generates statements like ""Wonka's a genius Charlie!"" He may be a genius but he's also the main cause of their suffering and deprivation. So we've seen that Wonka isn't exactly a humanitarian, in fact he makes his money based on the exploitation of childhood greed. He invites five kids to his factory to find an heir, fair enough you may think, but four are just there to be tortured, humiliated and in some cases, mutilated. The Candyman hates kids but he's happy for them to do back breaking work for beans. I know you'll say Oompa Loompas are adults but lets be honest, their no better than Malasian four year olds making trainers. Wonka the liberator? Don't make me laugh - hes displaced an entire nation and used them to make a fortune, money that must look good on the books as the wage bill is nil - nuts for squirrels and cocoa for kids - all written off as substandard ingredients. If you want to talk about the film itself then all I'd say is that its a confused little piece - can't decide if its set in America or England - all the characters speak like Brits but use Americanisms. British kids don't use the word Candy, its sweets or Chocolate OK? Burton true to recent form is complete anonymous - this thing could have been directed by anyone. Wonka's back-story is pointless - inserted to provide a horrid, syrup drenched ending which kills the sequel and turns the whole escapade into a dreary 'importance of family' chronicle. Utterly wrong. Oh and you can't hear the lyrics to any of the songs. Not only that but the critics who've said that this is a darker film than the 1971 version are blind, in fact the '71 was deceptively wholesome but had a healthy streak of cruelty running through it, this by comparison pretends to be dark while actually being safe and child friendly. Gene Wilder has been soiled. Wake him up and tell him someone!"

","Well, what can I say. As a fan of the three-headed Burton/Depp/Elfman monster, AND Roald Dahl, this seems a match made in heaven.<br/><br/>Burton has a trademark look to his movies that takes reality and twists it slightly (grey locations in snow? yep, that's a Burton). Roald Dahl has a similar style in his writing, where the seemingly familiar become fantastical and slightly sinister - although never really dangerous. The design, casting, acting, score, direction are all pretty much perfect... the story however... well...<br/><br/>Without spoiling anything, this project seems at first to have been an attempt to faithfully recreate the book on screen, and for the first 90% of the film they achieved it, aside from some glaring pandering to those people who don't watch anything that isn't 'Hollywood'. There's a reasonably unobtrusive back story added for Wonka, told in flashbacks, which is forgivable as it doesn't alter the story in any major way. There's also the obligatory script faux pas to make it more palatable to that small yet powerful lobby of movie-going Americans who find it confusing and disturbing to hear unfamiliar English terms for things; you find me an old English man who refers to trousers as pants and sweets/chocolate as candy - it can't be done (oh and we don't use dollars either).<br/><br/>Both of these however are understandable in today's culture, where America's box office dollars mean more than film integrity (maybe I'm the only person left who shudders slightly when watching Harry Potter and the 'Sorcerer's' Stone, probably so).<br/><br/>What is a step too far however is the jarringly 'Hollywood' ending, which is a shock after the lush dark fantasy and relative accuracy of the rest of the movie. Remember how bad A.I's ending was? Yes, this is just as bad. I wonder if some idiotic test audiences played a hand in this slushy Disney-fied mess of an ending, or if the script writer felt it would never sell in Hollywood unless it has some moralistic rubbish thrown in for good measure.<br/><br/>Whatever the reason, it's like someone handing you the greatest Wonka bar in the world, then telling you it was sneezed on after you've already eaten it. You enjoyed it at first, but now that bad taste in your mouth will be all you remember. What's even more stupid, is the original ending has an easy sequel hook, which is now discarded in favour of Willy Walton's All American Christmas Special - g'nite Willy, g'nite Charlie boy..."

","My little sister wanted to see this film so I volunteered to take her. I was not over excited by the fact I was going to see it, so wasn't I pleasantly surprised by the time the film had finished.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp was particularly good - an actor who showed extreme diversity in his role. He did not play Wonka in a sweetly sickly way but portrayed him as a good man with curious mannerisms and perhaps a little bit of a disturbed mind due to his childhood. Great for kids as he was flamboyant and great for adults because he was mysterious.<br/><br/>The film was filled with funny one liners and gems of scenes that had me laughing heartily. I particularly liked the scene where Veruca's father handed Wonka his business card and Wonka immediately discarded of it over his shoulder.<br/><br/>The visuals of the film were equally enticing. Filled with colour and magic beyond belief, the film really let you escape from every day reality. After all didn't everyone want to be Charlie and visit at Chocolate Factory at one point.......................? Overall, a great light hearted film for kids and adults to enjoy with great performances for all the cast."
"Helen-Carr","6","1","3","12 August 2005"," Where are we?
","Being a fan of the book and original film I had high hopes for Tim Burton's stab at this fabulous tale. All praise to Johnny Depp for his magnificent performance- funny, quirky and charismatic. Unfortunately I cannot truthfully continue with praise for the rest of the film. Most disappointing of all were the Oompah-Loompahs. After the genius of Nightmare Before Christmas and Mars Attcks I suppose I was expecting something a bit more special from Burton and felt let down by what I felt in comparison was a lack of imagination. Also in the original the Oompah-Loompahs despite being lovable were also just a little bit sinister which I felt was lacking in this version and the film was poorer for it.<br/><br/>Also can anyone please explain to me where they were? America? England? I appreciate the film is children's fantasy but it did seem very odd and a bit confusing at times, for example Charlie and his family were English yet used dollars as the local currency! Overall I would say this film is worth watching but try not to have too high expectations because I did and left the cinema extremely let down and pining for the original."
"turkam","6","1","3","10 August 2005"," Hmmmm.... I think I'm getting sick of remakes....
","I must say the list of films that have been remakes that have been released within the last 2-3 years if quite a long one: ""The Longest Yard,"" ""War of the Worlds,"" ""The Big Bounce,"" ""The Bad News Bears,"" ""The Stepford Wives,"" ""The Ladykillers,"" ""The Italian Job,"" ""Mr. and Mrs. Smith,"" and if you count the fact that it was for the BCC first ""The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Universe."" I'm sure I've left a half-dozen out, and I did not include movies that are remakes of TV shows like ""Bewitched."" Of course, there are a lot of those too! Tim Burton's second or third cinematic remake is an interesting one. I actually liked his version of ""Planet of the Apes,"" even though the first one is one of my all-time favorites and I was politically against its reworking. I thought Burton's charm might work again here. And, it almost did. Johnny Depp gives an interesting Parkey Poseyesque performance, the special effects are outstanding, and the message of how greed corrupts us all is indeed a good one. I haven't read Roaland Dahl's original story. From what I gather this film is pretty faithful to it. I guess I would've liked this movie more had I not seen the original. It is a very charming movie, with a great performance by Gene Wilder. I think what made it more pleasant was the surprises. When it was made in 1973, few children films had such dark elements and such great, sharp humor. And, I think Wilder's performance is better than Depp's because the former did not reveal Willy Wonka's sinister side as obviously as Depp did. I think as far as overall careers go, Depp will surpass Wilder who has not really made a good film in almost 20 years. But, when it came to Wonka, Wilder was better. The earlier film was made on a lower budget and did not have razzle dazzle special effects, but perhaps timing is everything. And, ""Willy Wonka and The Chocolate Factory"" was simply a film of its' time. The same might be said for some remakes, but alas not this one. It is not a complete waste of time by any means, but the shadow of its' predecessors looms over it and can not be ignored. Now, I 'can't wait' to see what they do with ""King Kong."" Like Burton, Peter Jackson is a good director, but the remake will not have Fay Wray and no amount of special effects can compensate for that."
"spacemonkey_fg","10","1","3","5 August 2005"," A perfect film for Burton, Depp and Elfman to work on
","Title: Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (2005) <br/><br/>Director: Tim Burton (Edward Scissorhands, Sleepy Hollow) <br/><br/>Cast: Johnny Depp, Helena Bonham Carter, Freddy Highmore, Deep Roy, Christopher Lee <br/><br/>Review: Tim Burton the master of the Gothic and the dark, the bizarre and the fascinating takes on Roald Dahls children's book which if you ask me was tailor made to be adapted into film by Tim Burton. Burtons affinity to the weird side of cinema lended itself for him to do this movie and to have Johnny Depp star in the main role as Wonka and to have Danny Elfman do the music and songs...well thats just perfection in my book.<br/><br/>Many are familiar with Gene Wilder as Willy Wonka, the magic chocolatier from the 1970s children's film. The story in Burtons version doesn't change much. A reclusive Willy Wonka locks himself up in his gigantic candy factory because some competitors try to steal the formulas for making some of his candies. So he goes into a fifteen year seclusion and then suddenly he decides he wants to leave all his fortune to one lucky kid. So he makes a contest...whoever finds the magical golden ticket in one of his candy bars gets to come in to his factory and see all of his marvelous candy making secrets. One of the five chosen children will get to keep it all at the end of the day...but which one? It will be inevitable to compare the two films. They are very similar story wise, same situations, same kids. But the thing that makes this one different is Wonka. Depps Wonka is slightly darker, slightly nuttier, slightly less nice. He is quickly annoyed by kids, he hates parents and he actually has a background story made specifically for the movie. Thats what makes this movie different. Willy Wonka has depth, a past and a reason for being the wacky dude that he is. Other then that, we also get a background story for the Oompa Loompas which was great. It was cool to finally get to see ""Loompa Land"".<br/><br/>This movie is very very Tim Burtonesque. It has hes Gothic flare, once we get to Wonkas factory and its rooms its very evident that yes, this is a Burton flick. From the moments that you see huge twisted candy canes resembling dried up trees...and when he starts addressing those familiar Tim Burton issues like the whole thing with the abusive unloving parent...well that reassures it. Tim Burtons own personal life bleeds into his films, he didn't have a happy go lucky childhood and he and his father obviously didn't get along. This shows up in the film via Willy Wonkas unhappy relationship with his father played by non other then Christopher Lee.<br/><br/>Another thing that had me worried. Would this movie have the oompa loompas singing their little Oompa Loompa rhyme songs? Well I was surprised to see that yes, they did their little musical numbers. But unlike the first film where the songs where this little 1 minute diddys...on this one the Oompa Loompa do their musical song and dance, but damn was it cool! Burton transformed the Oompa Loompas song interventions into big huge musical numbers! With hundreds of Oompa Loompas singing and dancing all over the place! Great music by Danny Elfman and even wardrobe changes for every single song! I mean its a real step above from the first film. My hats off to Burton for making a movie which I will no doubt watch over and over again simply for watching the oompa loompas singing and dancing. When Willy Wonka says ""I believe they are going to treat us with one of their songs"" get ready for something special! Anyhows, in conclusion, this film was great! I'm glad Tim Burton decided to do this film which in my opinion was a perfect breeding ground for Burton, Depp and Elfman to cut loose and do what they do best. Cant wait to see what The Corpse Bride will be like! <br/><br/>Rating: 5 out of 5"
"nixholl","10","1","3","4 August 2005"," A fantastic adaptation of the book. (Tim Burtonified)
","When i came out of the cinema after having watched Charlie and the chocolate factory for the first time i was really not sure what to make of the movie i had just used the last two and a half hours of my life for. Firstly it is a very Tim Burton perspective of the book and even the trees in the chocolate room are reminiscent of his previous work but in this particular case i think it took a visionary like Tim Burton to bring the children's fantasy world of chocolate to life. Secondly i thought that the oompa loompas were fantastic. The songs they sing were not quite how i had imagined but were entertaining none the less, and thirdly and finally on the plus side the casting of a majority of the characters was fantastic, however unsurprising it is to see Helena Bonham Carter and Johnny Depp on the list. On the negative side of the movie and only a few points here, i felt that the issues Tim Burton tried to bring in with Willy wonka and his father did not appear to fit in with the rest of the fantastical world of Willy wonkas factory, it was a tad too much realism amongst such vision. I felt also that Johnny Depps portrayal of Willy Wonka was flawed. I was impressed with his ability to appeal to children but his accent at times was poor and he seemed somewhat sadistic in his wish to get rid of the children one by one the way a madman would. Overall I would give this movie a 9 and three quarters As it was thoroughly enjoyable enough o sit through twice in as many days but with minor annoyances, but then who and what is perfect."

"debra_hamel","7","1","3","8 August 2005"," Sometimes Less is More
","In short: not as good as the original movie. (Spoilers to follow.) Charlie himself and his various grandparents were at least as charming as those in the previous version, but Johnny Depp was too creepily strange to be a likable Wonka. His Michael Jackson-ish portrayal of the chocolatier has been commented on elsewhere, and it's an apt comparison. Gene Wilder did it far better: you got from his portrayal of Wonka that his character was flawed, that he was not simply a happy-go-lucky guy who loved children. He had issues. He had an edge. But Wilder didn't beat you over the head with it.<br/><br/>Along the same lines, the movie did not need the flashbacks about Wonka's childhood that explain his preoccupation with chocolate and some, at least, of his quirks: his overbearing dentist of a father didn't allow the young Willy sweets, and Wonka has family issues in consequence. Well, sometimes less is more: we didn't need to know what in his life had set Willy Wonka off. Indeed, defining his problems somehow diminishes them. (Nor were the flashbacks of Wonka's initial encounter with the Oompa Loompas at all necessary.)<br/><br/>The story told in this movie, too, is inferior to that of the original. (I don't remember the storyline in the book sufficiently to comment here, but this movie certainly diverges pretty far from it.) Charlie wins the factory here by default: there is no gobstopper honesty test--remember that touching scene in the original in which Wilder grabs Charlie's hand and tells him that he knew all along that it would be him? Two other scenes spring to mind as decidedly inferior in this version, as well, and similar in why they're inferior. <br/><br/>(1) In the original movie Gene Wilder, after some delay, walks--slowly, with a limp--out of the factory to greet the crowd and the assembled golden ticket winners. The mood among those gathered turns, as they watch his slow progress, from jubilant to--what?--surprised, disappointed, depressed: Wonka's not what they'd expected; he's not vibrant; he's sad. Then of course he lets on that it was an act. He in fact is vibrant. But he's demonstrated in this simple, affecting scene that there is something a little off about him. The new movie aims to create a similar mood and a similar effect, but its makers go big: there are songs and animotronic puppets and fire to greet those arrived at the factory. Wonka's audience is appropriately dismayed, but it's nowhere near as effective as Wilder's limp. It's just too much. <br/><br/>(2) Similarly, there is the boat scene. In the original Wilder makes the too-fast boat ride genuinely scary just with his acting, by his quickening speech/song, because his behavior is erratic enough that you're worried about whether he can be trusted. In the new version the boat ride is made less scary with more work--special effects. Again, less is more. (And granted Depp's character has erratic behavior to spare, but somehow his Wonka is not as frightening here as Wilder.) <br/><br/>Finally, the new movie takes the Wonka story farther than the book or movie do. With Charlie's help, Willy resolves his problems with his dentist father and loses his family issues: an absurd and unnecessary addition to the story.<br/><br/>In closing, I'll return to what I said in the opening paragraph, that Depp's Wonka is not likable. As portrayed by Wilder, Willy Wonka, however odd his behavior, was a nice man. When he behaved badly you were upset because he'd disappointed you. It's not the grand prize that Charlie is sad to lose in the original: it's Wonka himself. But when this new Wonka behaves badly--when he in effect denies Charlie the chocolate factory--one is not disappointed with him; one is more apt to think ""good riddance."""
"StlCntPly","3","1","3","8 August 2005"," Wasted My Time
","Okay, I tried hard not to comment on this movie, since I have almost NOTHING good to say about it. First off, I have never read the book, but if you make a movie that has already been made, IT'S A REMAKE. This is not different enough to constitute a retelling. **SPOILERS** from here on. IF this follows the book so closely, the author is a true visionary. The OOMPA LOOMPAs were performing Janet Jackson and Kiss/Hard Rock moves and video displays. My guess NOT IN THE BOOK. There is a total lack of character build up. The only decent actor, was Charlie (very good). Grandpa, no connection. Charlie wins the ticket and Grandpa Jumps around. I had NO feeling he was bed-ridden or had difficulty walking prior to that. The whole movie talked down to the audience. EVERYTHING WAS EXPLAINED. 'Charlie only had one present a year, and that was a WONKA BAR' Boy, I wonder what he's getting this time. If it wasn't a five year old could have figured it out. Burton has been overrated for years, I know that goes against the mainstream, but I like to think for myself. Stop with the drab colors already, You've DONE THAT, MOVE ON. Johnny Depp, also overrated, played his best Michael Jackson (I think that was pointed out in other posts) and during the Oompa Loompa flashback, Jim Carrey (Blatant). He hates kids and doesn't want to be near them, yet in one scene, he sticks his hand right in the middle of them and leaves it there. Next scene, ewww kids. Poor attempt at trying to show motivation to Willie's love for chocolate. And if he wore those S&M braces for so long, why does he have such an overbite? The build up of the golden tickets fell short too. Where was Charlie's psych when he opened the bar. Instead of ""I wish you could go Grandpa,"" It's who shall I take ""ME"" he yells. Call that connection? What about DAD? Running out of time so I will cut to the big LOSER. NO GOBSTOPPER villain. They introduced it and that was it. Charlie won the factory because he was the least-bad-kid. There was no relationship with him and Wonka. Just because he refused it for family and Depp had another LAME flashback, everyone talks about the relationship factor. Relationships build not appear.<br/><br/>Sorry for wasting too much space"
"javier-rodriguez-c","8","1","3","7 August 2005"," Burton's bold step toward maturity through his own ""style"" self affirmation
","First of all let me state that to Hollywood's mainstream aesthetics Burton is certainly the most disturbing and utterly wicked artistic approach representative, he is plainly as freaky as it gets and sports such reputation with evident pride.<br/><br/>Although one could easily name at least a handful of directors with a, by far, more edgy film  making style, few have been able to establish a truly own stylistic universe with enough attractive and cohesion to let them forge an artistic career based upon continuous explorations and exposes of such iconoclasm and paraphernalia. Moreover, if anything has contributed Burton into achieving this, it has been both stating and repeating over and over certain themes and tunes (openly dark, ghoulish, with the recurring bitter childhood, Halloween, Christmas, sense of exclusion, awkwardness themes) , the Burtonesque typecasting (one can almost associate actors like Depp, Bonham Carter, Walken, Keaton, De Vito with his most representative work), and the creation of an overall gloomy and depressive mood with the help of Danny Elfman's brilliant scores. Those elements have let Burton create a bizarre ""factory"" of imagination, art and nightmares, all faithful to his personal and unique sensibility. Now we can easily find this entire ensemble of element within ""Charlie and The Chocolate Factory"".<br/><br/>The movie itself, since Burton overtook the directorial duties, distanced widely and openly from the first book adaptation (Gene Wilder's ""Willy Wonka and The Chocolate Factory"") but wanted to stay faithfully close both to Burton's style and Dahl's Book. And it certainly does with fairly nice results.<br/><br/>This movie has not been marketed as a kid's flick, and it is not just that,we are promptly warned about that, this movie contains adult humor, witty and sometimes sarcastic remarks, deep psychological overtones, a moral (well they could have just skipped this one, but it wouldn't have been completely true to the novel's spirit nor to the unavoidable Hollywood canons), a significantly relevant emotional sub  plot that aware ""grown ups"" may relate with and a vast gamut that is certain to delight most of the audience for it is a true feast for the senses, however twisted into Burton's own fashion.<br/><br/>A key element and pivotal role is played by Wonka, rather than Charlie, who indeed does a neat job as a bridge between the adult and the kids world, where Willy Wonka seems to be happily lost in opposition to Charlie himself who appears to have the moral schemes of adult people; lots of people have noticed that Depp's portrayal of Wonka may have been a little too freaky and disturbing, so let's get into that aspect.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp masterfully leads us into a world of madness and isolation, where colorful child fixations may have more than one simple meaning as we will discover as the film advances. The nasty, spoiled kid, misanthropist, dark and strikingly silly but lucid way Deep has chosen to characterize Willy Wonka is gonna shock most people and will make them doubt about the true good intentions of such iconography that, with the wardrobe and all just reminds one of a certain Jackson guy who apparently had the same interests and personality traits as the factory owner. One thing is quite obvious, Wonka is, perhaps not consciously, a reference to MJ and that is evident in certain lines and points, rather than in the mannerism and some attitudes by WW; like the ""We have so much in common"" line , the father issues, and so on. However be not afraid, kinds in general won't notice this and probably only older wicked teens and grown ups will giggle and maliciously laugh at those aspects. It must not be an element that makes you not go to the movie.<br/><br/>Closing this comment I should mention the overall good performances and characterizations, thanks to the effective but not outstanding script, happily supported by a nice cast where both Christopher 'Count' Lee, ""Grandpa Joe"", ""Mike TeeVee"" should be recognized alongside Depp (the best here) and ""Charlie"" (close second); they all offer convincing and engaging acting.<br/><br/>Finally just let me remember you this movie is not supposed to be a creative milestone, nor a character driven powerhouse story, less ""Oscar Marketed Material, so go to the cinema with the right expectations and you'll not be disappointed but surprised; it is a movie aimed toward the family segment but would surpass the simple ""box office bait"" appellative for it is a nice and enjoyable movie with quite some substance underneath. Don't ever forget this one is a Burton film, that is utterly important, otherwise you'll be shocked by some of his nightmare like representations; try to forget the previous film, at least while watching this one, it will help a lot because they are so wildly different that they could be anymore alike. This movie works well on many levels, your kids will enjoy it, teenager will be amused by its witty remarks and sarcasm, grown ups will have plenty of maturity to bestow upon, Burton fans will find plenty of what they look for in his films, novel fans won't be disappointed, previous film fans will rejoice with how different the approach can get to be, gossiping people could chat about MJ references, so there is something for everyone here.<br/><br/>However if you don't like Tim Burtons aesthetics don't go, if you don't have an open mind avoid watching it, you could find it disturbing and controversial for your taste, but just don't miss one of the most, if not the most, interesting ""family"" films I've seen this year and let this warm, deep, visually stunning, plain fun flick seduce you and take you into the ""factory""."
"mogavero","3","1","3","7 August 2005"," Why?
","This was unbelievably horrid rendition of this originally wonderful and imaginative film. Somehow Burton manages to take a playful and dreamy movie and makes it into a contrived, dreadful and sinister mockery of one of the great children's films. Depp plays a character that looks and acts insane and bizarre and is not at all the right actor for this film. Frankly, he is difficult to watch and there is significant focus on him throughout the film, so be prepared to be annoyed throughout the film. If you must sit through this film, do your best to wipe out any memory of the original film or you will be sure to be very disappointed."

","At first I was skeptical of the new ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory,"" with all of its changes and adaptations. I thought the movie wasn't going to be as great as Gene Wilder's performance, but having it been a Tim Burton rendition, I decided to see it. <br/><br/>I loved it! This Version of the movie gives a deeper meaning, as well as an explanation to why Willy Wonka is the way he is. ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" contains the little details mentioned in the book by Roald Dohl. In a comparison between the original and the new, I would recommend this version. Johnny Depp's performance proved to defy my expectations!"

","This movie brought the mastery that Tim Burton is famous for and the talent that is the cast to life. Not only with amazing leading actors, like Johnny Depp and Freddie Highmore, but also a spectacular supporting cast including David Kelly, Helen Bonham Carter, and Noah Taylor. With wacky scenery and costumes with provide as much delicious eye candy as a Wonka Bar ever could. I also believe that this movie had to be a success due to its similarity to the book, using the original lyrics and following more closely than the Gene Wilder version. Johnny Depp shows that he will never take a normal role, and I hope he never doesn't, bringing hilarity to the big screen. A visual masterpiece, a work of art for all ages. This movie will make you laugh, and believe in the goodness of an innocent heart. Not just for kids. Great for everyone anytime."

","When I left to go see this film I has in the back of my mind the thought ""Will this be as good as the original"" and worried that it would not compare. Although having seen it I see that there is no way that the two can be prepared. This new make of the book has been created with completely different ideas of how Wonka behaved and how the factory looked. The Creators have revolutionised the film into the 21st Century.<br/><br/>Along with new added parts to the movie and some parts taken away, this movie has become a colourful and funny film to watch. Jonny Depp fitted Willy Wonka to a perfect T. He was funny and gave all the right facial expression and comedic quirks at just the right time in the right style to make you chuckle. Along with Charlies character who played the shy poor boy that was just lucky and happy to be places with his family. The actor was quiet although not too quiet he made you feel his presence within the right scenes where he wished to be noticed.<br/><br/>Different things brought into this films are the change in the Umpa Lumpa's songs and you get an in-site of flash backs from different characters explaining the background to all their stories.<br/><br/>Despite the fact that all the character had an English accent (even Depp who intentionally aimed to do so) the scrips was still including American words of which you would not hear during an English film. Although despite that this is a highly enjoyable film and a good choice to take your children or to go with your friends to see!!! 8.5/10"

","This movie was incredible! I was quite young when I saw the first one, and frankly was scared by the weirdness of it. Several of the scenes were flat out...strange. Johnny Depp did an amazing job (as always) as Willy Wonka, and it's definitely worth seeing! Though one problem I did have was that the movie was missing the original Oompa Loompa song; nonetheless, the were still very cute, and absolutely hilarious! One thing I liked though was being able to see what had happened in Wonka's past, how he became a choclateer, etc. Anyway, the movie was not nearly as...odd as the first one, which in my opinion, is a plus. I definitely recommend this movie!"

","This is the best film that I have seen in a very long time. Jonny Depp is wonderfully funny in this and looks great, sexy as usual, even though he looks remarkably similar to Michael Jackson to some, but oh well. The Oompa Loompahs (sorry for spelling) provide the most amazingly funny humour to those of all ages. This film makes you smile all the way through. Then there's the fact that this film shows the book as it was actually written - it is not a smile, happy little story for the little children, it is actually quite a dark and mysterious book with lots of underlying meanings. And the film has lots that the book didn't have too. It gives the most wonderful history to the character of Willy Wonka and that is a great thing to see."

","I personally thought that this film was amazing. Although i could see the points of criticism that some people make of it. I loved the original film but this is spectacular in its own right and from the directing to the acting i was enticed every minute.<br/><br/>But The portrayal of Wonka could be seen as a little distant and a little more freaky than that of Gene Wilder. I think that Jonny Depp played it well and with a deeper dimension than some people have seen. But i think a lot of people were expecting a remake rather than a new film, so have judged it too much on its predecessor.<br/><br/>The factory itself is amazing and with the enhancement of graphics it looks wonderful beyond your wildest dreams (which it is supposed to be). Though you could comment that on occasion it is a little too graphically produced and the om-pa lumpas(cant spell sorry!) were a little frustrating. Their songs were funny but they all looked the same which for me was one of the only disappointing bits, and made them nearly as bad as the bright orange ones!!!! Just to add the only other annoying part is that Charlie doesn't steal and show the element of a bad little boy in this film which i thought was an important dimension that was missed.<br/><br/>Overall though i think that it is a good film for all ages and maybe even more so for younger children who haven't seen the first adaptation. I took my brothers and the older ones thought it was rubbish and the younger ones though that it was magical. And for me that is the aim of the book so it achieved its purpose."

There is absolutely no point in drawing comparisons with the original WWATCF. This is so different, so much darker. I'm a huge Johnny Depp fan anyway and, once again, he has displayed his phenomenal talent to totally become the character he's playing. Depp's Wonka is quite freaky especially in relation to his reactions to the children. I went to see this movie with two adult friends and we enjoyed it as much as all the children in the audience. There was a spontaneous round of applause when the movie ended. I'm already planning to see it again this weekend! The reason I rated it 9 out of 10 instead of a perfect 10 was because of the oompa loompa's - I just could not hear the words of their songs and found this really annoying."

","When I heard that they were making another Charlie and the chocolate factory movie, my fist thoughts were that it was just another idea to make more easy money, and would probably turn out awful. Yet these views were blasted straight out of my head when I heard that it would be another product of the dream-team (Depp and Burton). I loved all three of their previous movies together, and the thought of another was so exciting - it became my most anticipated movie for ages - I was not disappointed. <br/><br/>As soon as it started, that trademark Burtonness that is impossible to explain hit me and I was gripped. The whole film was visually stunning, and every actor and actress was perfectly cast, especially Johnny Depp. He delivered one of the best performances, truly taking Wonka to another level. Although Gene Wilder played Wonka well in the 1971 movie, Depp was much more disturbing and funny, yet oddly more lovable - and revealed himself towards the end as being quite vulnerable. Deep Roy was perfect as the Oompa Loompas - freaky, disturbing and funny, and sending creepy shivers down your spine when the children meet their sticky ends and they start singing excitedly, this is then all topped off with Wonka's obvious delight at their suffering (you MUST NOT miss the squirrel scene when Veruca meets her end, its, well, of want of a better word, FABULOUS.) <br/><br/>The whole film was pure art from beginning to end, beautiful, colourful and surprisingly Gothic, and manages to keep perfectly to the spirit of the book, which the 1971 version sadly missed. It was dark with a heartwarming centre, then coated with sugar - a perfect, faultless movie and a rare gem - you would rather die than miss this, and it would be a crime for it not to be a classic. Roald Dahl must be grinning his head off."

","What to say, what to say? Well, I already love Johnny Depp, and Tim Burton is a genius with fantasy/sci-fi movies. But Charlie and the Chocolate Factory? That was the best Johnny Depp/Tim Burton movie I have ever seen. The fact that the writers went past the portrayal of Willy Wonka in the original classic so far as to explain how Wonka became a chocolateer was amazing. And introducing the audience to Wonka's father, brilliant. I liked the Oompa Loompas in this movie better because they didn't look like clowns (I am terrified of clowns). What upset me about them, though, is that they were all the same. That was disappointing. But, other than that, I give it two thumbs up."
"alanjones792","3","1","3","4 August 2005"," Massive disappointment.
","About 30 minutes into the film the Oompa-Loompa's sing for the first time. Anyhope this film deserves to be mentioned in even the same breath to the 1971 original goes out of the window. One particular Oompa-Loompa sequence, just after Violet Beauregarde has been turned into a giant blueberry, is so bad it is actually probably the worst thing I have ever seen in a film that I have paid to see. But its not just the Oompa-Loompa's that will leave anyone with a genuine love for such a classic story cold.<br/><br/>Depps fans won't like to admit it, but his performance is completely wrong. His pale skin, unclear motives and childish behaviour (giggling, for example) bring to mind a rather more famous man child of recent times. In fact, Depp would only have had to burst into 'Black Or White' and I would have been convinced this was Michael Jackson and the Chocolate Factory. Where is the slightly eccentric uncle with a secret past that Wilder played so perfectly in the original? Instead we are given an incredible inept attempt to explain Wonka's past which removes any sort of interest the viewer might have in the character by explaining away the myth (although Christopher Lee's turn as Wilbur Wonka is brilliant).<br/><br/>The script on the whole is awful, falling on clichés and uninspired, dull dialogue and focusing too much on Wonka. This is meant to be a film about Charlie NOT Willy, hence the CHARLIE in the title (it's ironic that 1971's Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory manages to focus on Charlie more. Its also far to Americanised - if Charlie must be offered dollars at every opportunity, told to 'clean his pants' and we hear 'jerk' bandied around Willy nilly then set the film in America... don't create some strange hybrid Eng-America where your too lazy or stupid to localise the script properly.<br/><br/>The acting (apart from the two mentioned earlier) is mostly unremarkable, though special mention must go to the kids who all manage to be terrible, especially Julia Winter whose acting is stilted and unconvincing. No wonder, as a whole, the children spend so little time on screen. Also why has Violet Beauregarde suddenly become a karate expert? I'm all for updating the ideas to fit in with the modern world (Mike Teevee's obsession switch from TV to Videogames is a good example of this) but don't do it at the expense of the story.<br/><br/>Good points? There are some - the whole world is wonderfully realised, exciting and imaginative and some of the special effects are genuinely special and Burton's trademark direction is there helping to create a film that is, at least, a visual treat. In fact, its only because of him that the film has managed to score as high as a 3.<br/><br/>Yes it REALLY is that bad."

He did a great job on twisting Gean Wilder's version of Willy Wonka. Actually, they're total opposites! Freddie Highmore did a great job as well. He played Charlie perfectly! This movie is also hilarious! There are some really funny parts. I quote them all the time and we laugh 'till it hurts! The Oompa-Loomas are awesome in this film! In the other film the orange skin with green hair is a little too much. These Oompa-Loopas are SO much better. The music in this film is really cool. It's a mix of different genres. Like the Oompa- Loompa songs are different mixes of funk, rock'n'roll, jungle and a hint of classical in the main title. I loved the music SO much I bought the soundtrack. I listen to it all the time. This movie is really really cool, funny, weird and it's touching, too. The moral to the story is there is no sweeter candy than family."

","Tim Burton's take on this story is far better, in my opinion, than the original movie. Johnny Depp is the perfect Wonka. This Wonka is absolutely hilarious. His eccentricity (sp?)makes up for his being kinda creepy looking. LOL. And you get to see flashbacks of his childhood. The script is funnier than the original and there's less singing (Thank God) The songs that are in it are amusing. Another new thing is the origin of the Oompa Loompas.

Tim  Burton has brought the real Charlie an the Chocolate Factory to life  and has done an outstanding job of it. I really loved every minute of  it. Jonny Depp in the role of Willy Wonker is pure genius. He's funny  charismatic, rather creepy and full of mystery which is exactly how i  feel Ronald Dahl wrote this character. The children all added their own  mark on each character and Julia Winter i feel brings the easiest  character to copy into her own right. I would suggest watch it before  you take your own children as you'll definitely want to see it again  and some scenes may scare younger children."

","I am a huge fan of Roald Dahl's work and I think that this was an awesome adaptation; yes, there are some major things that weren't on the book (as well as a lot of minor details, like the fact that in the book, both of the parents of every child, except Charlie visit the factory as well); but in general (I think) it's better than the 1971 film.<br/><br/>The performance of Johny Depp as Willy Wonka is way much better than the one that Gene Wilder did once. This new Willy Wonka is more interesting while the one Gene did was very cold. Also, the performance of the children is less cheesy now. The background they gave to Wonka wasn't really necessary but it gave a new spin to the story, when in the end, Wonka won't allow Charlie's family into the factory.<br/><br/>Another thing that shows how well adapted is this new version, is the fact that they respected Dahl's lyrics and gave them incredible music (well, I couldn't expect less form Danny Elfman).<br/><br/>One thing that worried me was the Oompa-Loompas, because everybody had the image of the 1971 film; but the performance of Deep Roy is simply amazing and it was such a bright idea to put him as every Oompa-Loompa.<br/><br/>So, it is a marvelous movie, I would say flawless. I dare to say that it is as good as the book."

","Ah (breathes in as if he began a new life) where to begin with this movie...? This is a fantastic movie, yes i am telling the truth, nope there is no abrupt punchline or derogatory statement to come; in fact there is no derogatory statement at all about this movie i loved it to bits, seriously! Well to get into the nitty gritty (trying not to spoil as well) the story is better; a young idealistic boy dreams of better things - all surrounding a giant chocolate factory (well he is a young boy) that sits a top the (presumably) mountain he lives on; at the top of the street. His name is Charlie and he is not a very well off creature, and in life he isn't really well of either; not very fast and indeed not that smart, apparently. An only child he lives in a small rickety and slanted house(whats with Tim Burton and casting Helena Bonham Carter in slanted houses...{BIG FISH})he lives with his mother, the kindly Helena Bonham Carter and father Noah Taylor who works in a dismal job and brings home little money, if any. As in the book and the books' previous 1971 incarnation the grandparents all still live (although they just look like corpses)in the bed in the centre of the house; although its more of a biggish room than house. To get on with the story quickly; Willy Wonka a once world-wide famed chocolateer, now a recluse is opening his factory to five lucky children; i do suppose you have heard and know this story, obviously. Anyway now to the story' presentation. Obviously this movie is going to be of Gothic twist because Tim Burton the master of Gothic slapstick (almost) is directing, with his favoured pet Johnny Depp who brings with him his favoured child star Freddie Highmore. This is a beautiful movie, the set pieces (esp. the actual chocolate-factory, where the chocolate is smoothed down to a frothy and foamy taste by waterfall) are brilliant and have that sharp Burton-esquire feel to them. The children are cast excellently. The story is far more in depth and just better than the previous 1971 release (although i am not comparing the two; because they are completely different takes of Roal Dahl's classic. Depp's version of Wonka is firstly superior to Gene Wilder's in the 1971 classic. Secondly, you really get a feel for Depp's Wonka. In the 1971 one Wilder is basically preying upon his own odd personality. Depp has created an entirely new (and better) Wonka in the form of a broken man, never truly a child but never truly and adult either. In summary casting; excellent - overall cosmetic presentation; excellent - acting; excellent - everything; excellent. And now to the best bitDeep Roy as the Oompa Loopmas, yes all of them. The computer generated munchkins of Wonka-land were a highlight for me in this movie from their quirky, funky yet so damm good and catchy tunes to their freaky, cool uniforms. I really enjoyed this movie and I know other people will. Hopefully people that aren't very cynical, because if you are you probably won't like this movie (what I mean is that the story can seem like pulp I suppose although I got carried away with the story and movie and so didn't mind at all, but try not to be too cynical because you mightn't like it if so  although I am kinda cynical and I thoroughly enjoyed this movie! I so have one bad thing to point out, Christopher Lee's character, I'll try not to ruin the movie whilst saying this, but I love Christopher Lee so much (in a purely plutonic way of course) but he is great in movie's and he playswell something that I dislike a lot, but still he was great in the role. That's the only fault. Everything is better, more vibrant and just brilliant. Another excellent notch on Tim Burton's movie-belt."

","I have heard numerous negative comments about this movie before it came out but when I saw the trailer, I couldn't wait until it came out. The first time I saw it I was amazed. Depp plays the part of Willy Wonka better than Wilder in the phsycedelic 1971 movie. What many people don't understand is that Willy Wonka is SUPPOSED to be crazy, odd, weird, or whatever you prefer.<br/><br/>While Wilder went for sweet and kind he was completely unfaithful to the book. Now, the oompa loompa's aren't SUPPOSED to be green and orange either, like they were in the other movie.<br/><br/>I think Deep Roy did a good job as the oompa loompas, though the digital superimposing of him to make the effect of many loompas was a bit dodgy in parts.<br/><br/>The songs were very funny indeed. Danny Elfman did a great job, for in some scenes, the powerful music gave me chills. All in all this is the best movie I've seen. By the way, I've seen it 6 times.

I respect Johnny Depp and Tim Burton quite a bit, and was a HUGE Roald Dahl fan as a child (James and the Giant Peach and Fantastic Mr. Fox were my personal favs), but I wasn't a big fan of the Gene Wilder movie. Oh I liked it, but it was too...whimsical. I never felt Willy Wonka was a happy, jolly man who sings songs. I thought he was a bit creepy, and more than a little nuts.<br/><br/>So, imagine my surprise when someone crawls into my head and makes the Charlie movie I always wanted.<br/><br/>There are so many times I laughed in this movie, I can't count them. And for a children's movie, this one was blessedly free of fart jokes, and toilet humor - thank god, or I would have revoked my Johnny Depp Fan Club membership for making that movie.<br/><br/>This isn't a movie everyone is going to enjoy - there are some disturbing parts (not sick-disturbing, or overly scary-disturbing, but he IS a creepy man), and its not the way a lot of people apparently imagined Wonka to be. But the children are all PERFECTLY cast, and the best scenes from the book are all here, in very grim and very excellent detail.<br/><br/>The movie adds a few scenes, but these are well done and in keeping with the story they were trying to tell. Its not a ""purist's"" favorite thing, but they work.<br/><br/>Well worth seeing in the theater. This was the first Hollywood movie I saw in Imax, and I don't regret that one bit - this movie was GREAT on Imax, and gave the whole thing a ""larger than life"" feel that wound perfectly with the theme of the movie.<br/><br/>See it.

","The first film to be based on the book Charlie and the Chocolate Factory lives so strong in peoples minds that comparisons are unavoidable. The book isn't actually very long, and the setting (ie The Factory) is so static that scenarios are replayed identically, but not as well.<br/><br/>The film is badly constructed and badly edited throughout - the whole opening sequence is cliché and uninspired. The section where the visitors first enter the factory and wander up the shrinking hallway is poorly handled. One minute they're at one end, the next by a tiny door. No middle ground. No ""is this hallway getting smaller?"" moment. And no-one bats an eyelid when they get there. There's a problem with people's reactions to events throughout the entire film. As the dreadful dullards get knobbled off during the factory visits, their parents appear not to care less. 'Oh dear, Augustus has just gone up a shoot, where do I fetch him?'. And zooming about in the Great Glass Elevator didn't faze the characters one bit.<br/><br/>The film does very little to improve on the originals visuals. I was expecting great things from Burton's factory setting, but I gasped when we eventually got there - it looked exactly the same as it did in 1971! Slightly more colourful, perhaps - but no imagination had gone into the design whatsoever. Same with the chocolate river boat ride. 5 minutes of swooshing about hither and thither will never replace the truly disturbing visuals the original enforced upon the boat occupants; especially the chicken decapitation.<br/><br/>Helen BC's teeth - what's that all about? The acting is uniformly bad. The kids are dreadful. There must be thousands of pretentious pre-teen moppets who could play pretentious pre-teen moppets, but the girl cast as Veruca Salt is flat and lifeless.<br/><br/>I liked the Oompas, and thought there songs sounded great (Dahl wrote the lyrics as part of the story, so there's really no getting away from musical numbers) except, I couldn't hear the lyrics. If you're gonna have songs, let's hear them! I couldn't believe that David Kelly (Grandpa Joe) was still alive, and I though he might peg out on screen. Thankfully (?) he wasn't given very much to do.<br/><br/>Can someone with a better memory for the book confirm for me that there is a soppy side story involving Willy Wonkas estranged dentist father uprooting his terraced house to the Yorkshire moors, with Charlie acting as the catalyst for their emotional (read: vomit-inducing) reunion? I just don't remember it - or else I blocked its insipidness out of my mind.<br/><br/>Where is the film supposed to be set? It looked like England, but there was a lot of talk of dollars, and candy and band-aids.... the generic-euro setting of the first film is much better handled.<br/><br/>All in all a wasted opportunity."

","If you are one of those people who are wonderfully weird in every way then this is the movie for you. It is much brighter, more colourful and more weird than the first version and I agree with the Dahl family that Roald would have preferred this to the first version. Johnny Depp's portrayal of Willy Wonka is more true to the Willy Wonka in the book than Gene Wilder's and still manages to look sexy while at the same time a bit creepy.

In hindsight, suspense is what made the 1971 one so good.<br/><br/>There was also a real lack of characterisation. Once in the factory most of the guests rarely speak, and if anything Charlie is the most outspoken. There is little conversation between the guests. There's too much concentration on Wonka being wacky. Also, why has Mike TeeVee got an interest in video games, not TVs.<br/><br/>Some of the ""laughs"" are also very poorly done. Grandma Josephine (?) who comes out with random comments - typical old person who can't hear, hilarious, not seen that before. Wonka walking into glass elevator, better do it twice in case no-one laughed the first time. Mike TeeVee ""mumbling"", just the three times for that one.<br/><br/>Also the Oompa Loompas were not particularly easy to understand. Old ones were miles better.<br/><br/>Now onto the ending, what's with all this family nonsense? This isn't in the book.<br/><br/>What's with Charlie offering to sell his ticket? Nonsense.<br/><br/>Not a bad film in all, but it's been hit by the American bug of making a film unnecessarily cheesy. Why didn't Wonka invite the whole family to the factory like in the book? Disappointing."

","Better than I had expected. It remained faithful to the book (I'm also a Roald Dahl nerd), which I was happy about, but one of the biggest problems was the SONGS. That could have remained faithful to the '71 movie. As an Oompa-Loompa for Halloween, I am very attached to the old Oompa Loompa songs. ;-) And the old tunes are very catchy, as compared to the new ones, not catchy and NOT REPEATED. *groan* But anyway, one of the best parts of the movie was Willy Wonka. Because you see, in the Roald Dahl book, Willy Wonka is very...well, batty. He is very strange and not at all paternal, unlike the way he is in the '71 version. The children were very good, very bratty. One thing that could have been improved (yet this is from the book, not the movie) is that you obviously knew who the winner is going to be from the very beginning. It would have been better if you had maybe a few moments of doubt. I liked Missi Pyle as Mrs. Beauregarde; she's a funny actress, and overall most of the cast was pretty good. So...10/10. Though it wasn't always done perfectly as I'd like it, it was done very well.<br/><br/>********** 10/10"

I loved him, and I am so in love with this movie that next Sunday I am going to see it again.

Its a great movie for kids and even adults to watch! Johnny Depp did a great,but a little weird job playing Willy Wonka.

"perceptor","8","1","3","31 July 2005"," Wonderfully Childish
","I'm a bit young to remember Gene Wilder's famous performance in Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, but I found myself smiling throughout this particular version of the story. Note that I use the word ""childish"" here quite a bit. This is by no means a bad thing in this movie.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp does a wonderful job in the movie, giving us a glimpse of a mildly mad eccentric. The character has something of a childishness that is extremely nice, with a fairy tale styled faith that is uplifting and bright. At the same time, there is an almost sinister element to Willy Wonka. This element is perfectly played, however, and it adds depth to the character (and to certain scenes) that I considered most welcome<br/><br/>Freddie Highmore is wonderful as the charming and exceedingly kind-hearted Charlie. This movie is worth seeing with your children for the simple example of altruism and sweetness that this character evokes. Such children as Charlie are far too rare these days, and his gratefulness and his familial loyalties are exquisitely played. <br/><br/>What Charlie and the Chocolate Factory provides is a sense of wonder and childish excitement. To examine such a film with a critic's eye is precisely the antithesis of what the movie's theme is. The movie IS candy. Appreciate it for the childish joy and the lessons about the various vices that the children (aside from Charlie) display. Go in and enjoy a fairy tale type of magic, where you get to see things that would make your most childish dreams come true."

","My wife, my 6 yr old daughter, and myself really enjoyed the movie extremely. We love the Tim Burton/Jonny Depp take on the story. I have not read the book, but I hear this version follows the book closer than the Gene Wilder story. Please, don't get me wrong, I also very much enjoyed the Gene Wilder version. I don't feel the two can be compared. I feel they are two different, very well told takes on the same story. We liked the look back into Willy Wonka's childhood, and introducing us to his father. I also believe the advancement in special effects helped a lot in making the movie as good as it is. My next task is to read the book."

","I was at first skeptical to see this movie based on the original, Gene Wilder version, because I thought nothing could compare. Well, was I ever wrong. I enjoyed every minute of this movie from the time it started until the last credit (which, I might add, were LOOOOOONG, with no special afterword's, so don't bother staying). I loved it, loved it, loved it. I wanted to cry, and just when I thought ""if I see one more scene"" I will cry, I laughed my head off for the rest of the movie. I loved the fact that Willie Wonka's childhood was reviewed (which explained a lot) and I also loved the fact that Charlie's family was so well portrayed. MUST SEE, MUST SEE. Bravo, Johnny Depp. Bravo, again, Tim Burton....."

","I have seen this film twice, and have loved it both times, and I am going back for more. This movie is as true to the book as you could probably get, and the stuff referring to Wonka's dad brings you closer to him, to know what he went through.<br/><br/>I've read some negative comments about this movie, and I don't understand why ? This film was brilliant, Depp as Wonka couldn't have been better, all eccentric and crazy. Excellent. And then Freddy as Charlie. What a kid, he is such a great actor for his age, and really made me feel for him. The Oompa Loompa's were also great, with just the right amount of songs throughout the movie, and the right ones, straight from the book. Danny Elfman is a great composer, and he put the right music in the right places to make the audience feel like they should, sympathetic, happy, sad and many others.<br/><br/>The fact that there was only one part with Slugworth mentioned, pleased me a lot. There was too much of him in the original and it just spoiled it to have such a bad character in the original.<br/><br/>All those Burton and Depp fans out there, go and see this. In fact, everyone go and see it. You will love this just as much I do. Hopefully."

","Enjoyed this film immensely, largely because of Johnny Depp's amazing performance as Willy Wonka and the wonderful visuals, true eye candy, that Tim Burton offered up. Actor Deep Roy CGI duplicated dozens or hundreds of times as all of the Oompa Loompas was such an example that comes to mind. An added little bonus of great casting was the wonderful elderly, talented actor Christopher Lee (now 83 and still going strong from what I can tell), playing a stern dentist. Some of the musical numbers were fun and imaginative, while a few weren't anything to write home about. The movie is a bit disturbing in places for young children, but well-done overall."

"ttboney","Null","1","3","30 July 2005"," Absolutely awful film
","*** Possible spoilers *** I took my two teenage nieces to see this movie and we all absolutely hated this movie with a passion. I can not see how people say this is not a remake of the first. Almost everything is exactly the same with exception to the beginning and the end.<br/><br/>Sure, this movie adds more history to what made Wonka the way he is, but at the same time that's all this movie is about is Wonka. The children and parents in this movie were horrid, their acting was terrible. Now I know it's not the children themselves, but rather the directing and script, which is sad. This movie could have been so much more than it was.<br/><br/>The Oompa Loompa was down right disgusting. The stupid songs trying to be cool where nothing more than pathetic and annoying. I was not put off by the new look of the Oompa Loompa, but just rather the singing bits which again were stupid.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp playing Willy Wonka... well, at first I didn't like the way he looked or talked, but by the end of the movie I thought it sort of fit the part, especially with the new background of his childhood. He was however still too creepy and weird and should have been a little more Gene Wilderish at times. I think somewhere between the two character portrayals is the way Wonka should be, sort of strange, yet mysterious and spooky.<br/><br/>They should have focused just a little more on Charle and his grandfather. I sort of felt cheated with regards to them. I thought the little boy who played Charlie was really good when he was on screen. He really did make a good Charlie and I did like how he was so loyal towards his family, which is something Wonka didn't have nor could understand. <br/><br/>At times the CGI was okay, but other times it made you want to throw your popcorn at the screen hoping to make it look better. I did however like the room with the chocolate waterfall. I think Burton did a great job with that and the boat ride was okay, sort of dead though after the kooky one from the first movie.<br/><br/>If it weren't for my two nieces I would have probably walked out on this movie. It is really not worth your time nor money to go see. It's so bad I wouldn't even wait for it to come out on DVD to rent. This is a pretty harsh movie to watch and coming from me its even more difficult to speak about. I usually enjoy all movies and rarely will I get the disgusted, hateful feeling I did while seeing this movie. I wouldn't call it trash, but rather a HUGE disappointment that Tim Burton should be ashamed of.<br/><br/>But hey, to each his/her own. Each person is different, perhaps you will enjoy it and think its great, but I know we all thought it was terrible."
"J1nSan","8","1","3","30 July 2005"," Very enjoyable and interesting
","Well, I just saw it and it was pretty good. Johnny Depp did a great job as Willy Wonka. The way he portrayed Wonka's twisted love for candy was simply amazing. It was eerie, yet you'd expect it. Gene Wilder's portrayal of Wonka was okay, but that was merely just a childish appreciation of candy. As for Depp's portrayal, he was driven to the point to acknowledging candy to be the root of all reasoning. And Burton's style was clearly evident throughout the movie and totally helped strengthen the movie. A couple things that got to me was the Grandpa, the scene where he was dancing kind of annoyed and disappointed me. I was kinda of scared when I saw him do that... Also, I personally didn't like the songs the Oompa Loompas sang. They just weren't as cool as the originals. The cast for the kids were chosen and played very well. The only thing I'm currently basing this on is the movie, because I still have yet to read the book. The flashbacks were great though, by doing that Willy Wonka is developed to the point where you can realize what's driven him to do the things he has done. All in all, it was a very enjoyable film and just plain good fun."

","I was trembling with excitement to hear that once again Johnny Depp and Tim Burton were to combine their unique talents together once again to film the remake of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. <br/><br/>I am,admittedly, a huge fan of Johnny Depp and Tim Burton as both a combined team and alone and was eager to be one of the first to see it when It came out in the cinema. I was one of the lucky people as I was in America when it was released in the UK but still managed to go and see it two days earlier than any of my friends back home. <br/><br/>Anyway, more of the movie. The attention to detail is spectacular as Depp lends his quirky personality to the character of Willy Wonka and creates a wonderfully weird true-to-the-book chocolatier for whom the audience empathises with and recoils from simultaneously. <br/><br/>In short I believe that this movie is possibly the best I will see this year and the genius to include Johnny Depp as Willy Wonka himself is a spectacular feat. I give two up to Tim Burton and Johnny Depp and eagerly await the release of the duo's next cinema adventure, Corpse Bride."
"michael-1189","4","1","3","30 July 2005"," Choc-Factory remake is a non-success for me!
","Recently watched the remake of Charlie And The Chocolate factory with eager anticipation. As a Child I loved Roald Dahl books and also the 1970's version was magical to me. So in retrospect the new one had a lot to live up to! Unfortunately in my eyes it failed to deliver the goods. Johnny Depp is a fantastic actor, no one can deny that, his portray of Capt Jack Sparrow in Pirates of the Carribbean was nothing short of pure genius. Depp's Wonka, however, is wrong. Gone is the magical and mysterious Wonka portrayed by the charismatic Gene Wilder, here is some-kind of camp, feminine version more Michael Jackson than anything. Depp's Wonka has an great deal less presence and stature in the movie, far far far to cheerleader-like - this would surely have had old Dahl turning in his grave! To sum up, the new movie is far less entertaining and colourful than the 70's original - as a boy it was more so believable and amazing - it still is, but unfortunately this version is too dark and uncomfortable for me. There are some funny moments - particularly when the ooompa loompa's (played by one actor - very clever trick photography) are involved - but the changing of certain key story lines and Depp's portrayal of Wonka was the negative aspects. He could have done it so much better!"

"RogerEbertJr","10","1","3","30 July 2005"," Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is a fun film for the whole family!
","If you have read the book and/or seen the Gene Wilder film then the premise of this film is familiar to you. It is the story of an eccentric candy maker who gives a tour of his factory to five lucky children. Four of the children are brats and then there's Charlie. Charlie Bucket is portrayed in this film by Finding Neverland's Freddie Highmore, who delivers a solid performance. If this young performer continues at this rate he could end up a respected actor like his fellow Finding Neverland co-star, Johnny Depp. Depp, of course, plays Willy Wonka in this film. It is his fourth collaboration with director Tim Burton. Similar to the previous collaborations, Depp and Burton try their best to do something different. And, like their previous collaborations the final product is a success.<br/><br/>The film I felt was very well done. It was fun and I think the whole family will enjoy. The songs by Danny Elfman were very funny and I think could earn Mr. Elfman another Oscar-Nomination. And, like every Tim Burton film it features amazing production designs and solid cinematography.<br/><br/>The big question, however, is if it's better than the 1971 adaptation of the Dahl's classic children's book. While this film remained closer to the book and improved in certain areas, I felt the original is superior. Most of it has to do because of Gene Wilder's interpretation of Willy Wonka. Depp does a very well job, but he can't compete with Wilder's Wonka. That was the magic of the original film.<br/><br/>RATING: 4 (****) out of (****)"
"Dont_blame_the_goat","10","1","3","29 July 2005"," This is the best movie!

After I went to see this movie, I went back to my friends house and watched Edward Scissorhands and Sleepy Hollow, both of which are brilliantly written, hilarious, and cine graphically beautiful. It's just the way that all the scenes look pseudo-modern times, like in The Series of Unfortunate Events. The Victorian references are dazzling. And I want Willy's outfit so bad. The hat, the gloves, the coat, it's all working. My absolute favorite part of the movie is in the Chocolate River Room. "" Everything in this room is eatable, Even I'm eatable. But that's called cannibalism children, and is frowned upon in most societies."" Greatness!"
"Duzniak38","10","1","3","29 July 2005"," Hits the Sweet Tooth.
","I just got back to the first viewing of this at my local cinema, and I was blown away by this sickly-sweet treat! I was so eager to see this, as I love the Gene Wilder original, however after watching the remake I fell in love with it even more than I had fell in love with the original. It certainly stayed more faithful to the book than the original did, for example this film keeps the squirrel scene, where Veruca is proved to be a bad nut, and is then thrown down the garbage chute, and there are also extra scenes which we never see in the original, such as Oompa-Loopma-Land, however it added a dark and eerie story about Willy Wonka's childhood, which was certainly an interesting addition. I had to say in my opinion too, that I enjoyed the Oopma-Loompa songs in this remake far more than I enjoyed the ones from the original, and the fact that only one actor played every single Oompa-Loompa was a good chuckle too. I thought Freddie Highmore and Johnny Depp stole every scene with their quality acting, and Depp was excellent, as a dark, twisted, witty Willy Wonka. The film is certainly more twisted than the 1971 version, but it is still eye-pleasingly colourful and fun, both for children and adults alike. I highly recommend this sweet trip to Willy Wonka's factory. Dare to venture into his wonders, and indulge in the sweet, sweet hilarity and madness. You won't be unsatisfied."
"Shadow_Fish","5","1","3","28 July 2005"," Good from an objective point of view; poor when compared with possibilities
","I would have enjoyed this movie much more had I not become a huge fan of the 1971 version of Charlie a long time ago. However, when I went to see Burton's take on it, I spent the whole movie comparing the two. As many other people said, it doesn't do either justice to try and decide which one is ""better"". Neither is genuinely true to the book, so die-hard book fans will probably still be left unhappy (although I must admit that Burton stayed much closer to Dahl's original, despite the sub-plots that the movie threw in). This is a good movie to see if you come in unprejudiced or if you didn't like the other version, but otherwise, it will seem like a mediocre shade of the '71 movie/book.<br/><br/>My first problem with this film is Johnny Depp. I, personally, found him extremely annoying, but perhaps not so much because of his acting as because of the script. Having grown up with Gene Wilder's version, I never saw Willy Wonka as aloof and rude. Sure, Depp had his funny moments, but when he wasn't being funny, I wanted to strangle him. I saw no connections, no opinions from him about the kids except dislike. It just didn't seem right to me. I thought Wonka was childish, not petulant. Even if his performance wasn't based off of Michael Jackson, it sure came off that way.<br/><br/>The children were a mixed bag. Augustus was good, given the limited time he had. Veruca and Charlie were fine, not too overdone. But every time Violet or Mike came on screen, I wished for the movie to suddenly skip until they were gone. Violet has been updated to be an snobby overachiever instead of just a gum chewer (which I never found anything too bad about, personally; her only problem was that she was greedy and obstinate and just took Wonka's gum without asking). People like that are bad enough in real life, and I really don't want to go to movie-fantasy-world just to see more of them. Mike Teevee became an arrogant hacker-type who didn't really start to really get on my nerves until later on. Personally, I hate to pay in order to watch a movie that annoys me, although it does have some redeeming humorous moments.<br/><br/>I could go on for a while, but most of the other problems are minor and fade into the background. One addition, though, that many people have griped about, was Wonka's background, not present in the book. I found that to be one of the few good qualities of the movie. At least it wasn't changing something that had already been done; it just filled up a black hole that was never there. And while Depp is butchering Wonka anyways, why not go the whole way? I found it quite funny, actually. It also helped me deal with Depp's unsympathetic Wonka more. While the book version and Wilder's take didn't really need sympathy, Depp did. He really, really did.<br/><br/>Final Take: Go to this movie if you are in a good mood and you don't expect to be easily annoyed; avoid if you're a die-hard fan of Dahl or Wilder, unless you want to go to vindicate your belief that this will be a horrible mess. It's fun for a while, better than doing nothing and definitely better than most kids' movies. 6/10"

","After I heard the news that Tim Burton and Johnny Depp were working together again on a film called Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, I knew that this film could not fail audiences; particularly myself.<br/><br/>I'm sure most of you know the story of the film from its musical originator, Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory from 1971; so I won't bother giving you an idea of this story's plot. I very much enjoyed the story of the film, where director Tim Burton added a few things to make it more fun to watch; which I won't say.<br/><br/>I have an opinion on both leading roles of the film. Like everyone says, the film was very quirky and Johnny Depp's interpretation of the fabulous chocolatier Willy Wonka was thought by many to be creepy. In my opinion, Depp's vision as Wonka was far more original than I'd thought it would be. The new Wonka was more eccentric, childlike, emotional, and above all more quirky.<br/><br/>The second leading actor, Freddie Highmore as Charlie Bucket, impressed me a little more on a different level. Highmore's portrayal of the title character was also far more original that I had expected. His character had very much of a heart of gold and Highmore was talented enough to make all of Charlie's feelings and intentions genuine. I am impressed by these acting skills from a boy his age.<br/><br/>As for director Tim Burton, I was just as impressed with his performance on the film's production than I was with Depp's. I've always thought that Burton's visions of his past films were very creative and inspiring. So it was no surprise that I'd count this as his best film up to date. I think that Burton visualized exactly what author Roald Dahl was thinking of when he wrote the children's novel. Heck, he might've been the only man on Earth able to do it! The chocolate factory was filled with adventure in every corner, the Oompa-Loompas were very animated, and everything was just incredible. Danny Elfman's musical score of this film was very powerful and the ""heaviest notes"" were very inspiring.<br/><br/>I am grateful that I got the chance to watch this at IMAX theaters. I most definitely recommend this mind-blowing and heart-warming film for the entire family. I certainly hope this review is helpful to you all.<br/><br/>Regards,<br/><br/>J.C. Urbina"

","Burton's version of this classic '70's flick is just another stink bomb in the bummer summer of 2005.<br/><br/>Mr. Depp is a great actor, and one who has voiced his love of playing odd roles, and he pulls out a real doozy with his version of Willy Wonka. But do we really like this character? My answer is a clear no. He's way too creepy, and his motivations for having the golden ticket contest are never made believable in this picture.<br/><br/>Freddy Highmore as Charlie is one of the few bright spots in this current retelling.<br/><br/>The ""new and improved"" Oompa Loompas were a total bust. The new songs were the worst and I had no idea what the lyrics were even saying.<br/><br/>This version may be more faithful to the book, don't know as I never read it, but it sure makes for a lame movie.<br/><br/>The 1970's version clearly lacked the visual pizazz of the Burton flick, but it made up for that ten-fold by packing the story with heart. The Gene Wilder Wonka had a warmth, the Slugworth character gave Charlie and the other kids a much clearer dilemma. And many moments like the one where a kind-hearted Charlie momentarily tricks his grand folks into thinking he has the Golden Ticket because he wanted to see them all happy, are sadly missing from the new flick.<br/><br/>But worst of all this new version of the famous chocolate factory movie lacks ""pure imagination"", and I mean that in all its meanings.<br/><br/>I'm Tex Nickle and I seriously doubt this new version will live on in anyone's hearts and minds."

The introduction of all the characters is often hilarious, even surpassing the original movie at times. Violet and Mike are somewhat re-vamped, while Augustus and Veruca are basically identical, but the kids who play them are all very funny.<br/><br/>But when we finally get to the Chocolate Factory, things immediately go downhill. There are some amusing effects and cool set design, but the spirit of the original movie, and Dahl's original story, are absent. The movie just moves from one bigger, more elaborate version of the original set-pieces to the next, with no inspiration and no new spin.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp's portrayal of Willy Wonka is mind-boggling. What is this character supposed to be? An adult child? A clueless shut-in? Or just a generic weirdo? Depp brings nothing to the character, he just talks like Mr. Rogers' psycho cousin and makes a lot of funny faces, somehow managing to come off as wooden. Gene Wilder played the character like a mysterious genius who knew more than he was telling his guests. Depp plays the character like a goofy buffoon who's simply a poor host.<br/><br/>The actor who plays all of the Oompa-Loompas is funny for about one minute, then that joke grows increasingly tiresome. By the time he's dressed up like a rock star doing pinwheels, it's just plain stupid.<br/><br/>The screenplay is very lazily written. Situations pop up in the story which then go nowhere, such as Violet and Veruca sharing a private glance at the mention of Ever-Lasting Gobstoppers, but then nothing coming of it. It's as though the writer decided to get rid of anything he felt was extraneous to the plot; in other words, he wanted to get to the next special effects sequence quickly, and keep that pesky plot as bare-to-the-bones as possible. It's obvious the filmmakers feel that their audience wants flashing lights and pretty colors, not an interesting story.<br/><br/>And that is the problem with CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY. There's no shortage of things to look at, but once the novelty of that wears off, there's nothing more to it. Even a subplot involving Chirstopher Lee as Wonka's father is thrown in almost as an afterthought, then tossed aside as soon as it's served its purpose. Like so many Hollywood extravaganzas, there's a lot of CGI pizazz and mumbo-jumbo, but no soul.<br/><br/>The best I can say for CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY is that it is better than Burton's PLANET OF THE APES. Then again, so was PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE."

","I couldn't stand the first film adaptation of Dahl's book, so I was a bit reluctant to see the newer one. I ended up loving every second of it. It's hardly disturbing at all, and crazily fun to watch. Even the Oompah Loompahs were cool. I totally recommend this movie and give it nine out of ten stars (the missing star is for the continuity mistakes, which thankfully aren't very noticeable). Johnny Depp does a great performance as Willy Wonka, and I was very pleased overall with the ""dark atmosphere"" that Tim Burton's directing gave to it. Dark, but not disturbing or scary--that's the way to do it! There's even some humorous scenes to lighten the mood. Needless to say I walked out with a craving for chocolate."

","I've seen it a couple of days ago and I loved it!!!! I thought Johnny D could never play Willy Wonka as good as Gene Wilder did in the old version. Actually i thought it would be a rip-off of some kind that it would be just the same as the old one but with new actors. I was wrong. I went because a friend and I wanted to go to a movie but there wasn't something really exciting in the cinema close by so alright, why not, it's a nice day for a movie so we'll just go. We laughed a lot because it was pretty funny. I think Johnny D did great. It's not like the old version, they've changed a lot.

","I saw Charlie & The Chocolate Factory today and it was very good. I guess the only real major downside was that you pretty much know what's going to happen if you saw the original movie. Johnny Depp was a bit Michael-Jackson-like as I'd heard, but it didn't spoil the movie or anything. Tim Burton didn't disappoint as far as visuals go. The kids in the movie were all great, and very well cast. The new songs were cool, and I liked the flashbacks to Willy Wonka's childhood. They helped flesh out his origin, and that was a nice touch. They changed a few story elements around a bit. Charlie's Mom & Dad are alive, and Grandpa once worked at the chocolate factory. There was no Mr. Slugworth trying to buy secrets from the kids. There was also no scene where the kids had to sign a contract, or a scene where Charlie and Grandpa disobey Willy Wonka's rules. It was very well done."

","I've already seen this movie twice in the theaters and I'm amazed at how faithful it is to one of my favorite books. Charlie and The Chocolate Factory.

The ending was great with the stories of Willie and his father the strict candy-hating dentist.

"leilapostgrad","5","1","3","23 July 2005"," Austin Movie Show review
","This is definitely the most ""interesting looking"" movie of the summer. The production design will blow your mindbut nothing else will. Tim Burton is a genius at creating timeless, magical, mystical, and absurd realities (like he did in Edward Scissorhands and the first two Batman movies), and his interpretation of the famous chocolate factory is other-worldly. But besides great visuals, there's not a whole lot more to Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. Even Johnny Depp, as the Great Willy Wonka himself, was pretty forgettable. The greatest performance, hands down, was that of Freddie Highmore who played Charlie Bucket. He has such natural talent, but unfortunately he didn't have much of a script to work with  no one did. Also disappointing were the Oompa Loompas (all played by a single actor, Deep Roy). I liked the idea of their almost Amazonian / tribal background, but their songs were ridiculous and musically bad. A forgettable remake."
"aza1311","5","1","3","23 July 2005"," Tim Burton drops the ball!
","I disagree with most of the comments I have read, although the movie was kind of dark, anyone who knows Tim Burton movies, will know that he is a strange individual and this is normal movie making for him. The movie is just fine for kids, as a matter of fact, your kids will enjoy the movie more than you will. You will have trouble staying awake, especially during the musical scenes. Having said that, their where many problems with this film. First, growing up seeing Willie Wonka (Gene Wilder) was an opportunity to see a classic story that you could watch whenever you felt down, Charlie's character was so believable and heart warming, he represented someone that a lot of people could relate to. The new version jumped around so much, you never got a feel for Charlie, as a matter of fact, the story seemed to be more about Willie Wonka than Charlie, unlike the original. Second, some of the most memorable parts of the original movie where the musical numbers, especially Willie Wonka, Charlie and the Oompa-Loompa's. The new version bordered on annoying. Third, Tim Burton dropped the ball on this one, it could have been a great movie if he would of gone with a sequel, instead of a remake. The story line was already there for him to follow, Charlie grows up and realizes that he is not a child anymore, so he invites five new kids to find one like himself when he was young to help him come up with new ideas. It would have been easy to come up with new characters and ideas with todays technology. Fourth, although I like Johnny Depp as Willie Wonka, I think he over played the character, which would not have been the case if this was a sequel, because then he would be creating his own character as a grown up Charlie, who would be about the same age as Depp now anyways. Gene Wilder is irreplaceable as Willie Wonka, like Marlon Brando as the Godfather or Al Pacino as Tony Montana. The Oompa-Loompa character was even more of a disappointment, the idea of getting one person and CGIing him into the scenes to create more of them was not only ridiculous, it was a disservice to the many ""little people"" who probably have trouble finding good work in Hollywood as it is. Last, I was extremely disappointed with this new version and even sadder to say, I definitely will not be adding this one to my DVD collection when it comes out. It does not even come close to reaching the classic status of Willie Wonka and the Chocolate Factory!"
"cgrill8","9","1","3","22 July 2005"," A bucket full of goodness
","I will say after seeing the teaser I was skeptical, but liked the tune. Then I saw full trailer, and thought, this could be very good.<br/><br/>As a sucker for Burton's skewed and demented theatrical style from the norm, I thought to myself, ""This is a PERFECT story for him to do!"" Before the movie came out, there were many people with mixed feelings. Not many were hyped about it, but somehow I was. I would try and see the most recent released photos, then the most recent news, and then any previews on it just before the release. Everyone, including my wife, thought I was a little odd about being hyped about the movie. I remember hearing near the end of last year (2004), that the movie would be much closer to the book, so in Janurary I bought the book and read it in a weekend. It was NOTHING like the 1971 movie. The elements were there, the characters and main story line where there, but some of the personalities just didn't seem the same. (being in my 30's and seen the original movie up-teen thousand times, and being 'scarred' for life when I first saw at a very young age, I know the old movie VERY well).<br/><br/>The movie has been out for a while now, but still very fresh on many viewers minds. After seeing it twice now, I can truly saw this movie could become a cult classic in 8 years. Take Wonka's personality, and make it realistic... he hasn't been in contact with the real world in 15 years. Think about that. The kids all do a wonderful performances and show off the needed almost 2 dimensional personalities very well. Take Burton's use of make-up. Then look at the kids as the come on the screen, who looks the most, weather-beaten, labor-worked, unhealthy soul, honest-looking of the bunch. The one with the LEAST amount of make-up. The other kids are made to NOT look real; it's in the make-up and it's done very well. The special effects are astounding for the most part. Deep Roy, has done the impossible playing 26 different parts. This movie, I think has done, what Lucas SHOULD have done for Star Wars Episode II & III. You can not tell where Roy is real or not or duplicated...it's all very nearly seamless perfection tech wise, and really amazing seeing it pulled off so well (compared to some of the fuzziness in Lucas's EFX used in his last 2 Star Wars movies) and saying something.<br/><br/>I really think this is some of Danny Elfman's best work. He's made some really signature music in the past, but nothing can prepare you for this. And at least 4 of the tunes are nearly right out of the original book, and making it work..... on screen with music that was contemporary 17 years ago or more, but hey, that's OK. If it wasn't; it wouldn't have that 'jingle' it needed for a movie of this side of the demented street, and frankly I love it. Augustus Gloop's song is by far my favorite. I understand Deep Roy had a LOT of fun playing all the parts and even the all the different musical scores. Fair warning, this is not a musical. Mr. Salt's line in reference to the music seems already classic. Some of the instrumental score by Elfman, really hark back to his Beetlejuice days, and it's STILL good.<br/><br/>I can't wait for this movie to come out on DVD, but being owned by WB, I'm always worried about commentaries or deleted scenes, or extra stuff left out. WB isn't known for their DVD extras... and Paramount even less. We'll all have to wait to see what was left out of the final movie as well some behind the scenes footage as well. I can't wait. Toys R Us is/was about the only place I've ever seen that sells the Wonka bars, unfortunately, the chocolate and graham crackers don't taste very well together, or something... and now I can't find them anywhere for sell, good enough, considering I don't even like the taste of them, yet I love chocolate, go figure. I haven't spoiled the story, unless you saw the original from 1971 (like I did) then you already know it!<br/><br/>This movie may not be for everyone, and the logic is between being realistic, a little demented, and definitely 'by the book' (Dahl's), I give it a 9 out of 10 for pure fun and quirky atmosphere that looks ready-to-eat. Once you understand Wonka's character better, I'm sure you'll enjoy the movie even more so, just remember what I said... if you've been out of touch with the world for FIFTEEN years and teaching over a hundred people (who barely speak English, yet sing it VERY well...) how to run your factory, how well would you socialize?"

","Wow. This movie's not that bad, and its not a stupid kids movie, if even the darkest PG-rated movie I've ever seen. Tim Burton was pretty much born to direct this, and all of the kids were perfectly cast, from the violent video game addict Mike Teavee (Jordan Fry) to the gentle, good natured Charlie Bucket (Freddie Highmore).<br/><br/>You may have noticed that I have not mentioned Willy Wonka (Johnny Depp) yet. I thought his character was the worst, and possibly the strangest. No, no, let me revise that. He was the strangest character, by far, from licking the guts of a giant flying bee, to giggling happily after plastic puppets meet a fiery doom, in which they all melt. Strange, indeed.<br/><br/>But I did indeed enjoy his back story. Tim Burton has given him a strange childhood as the son of a dentist, who treats candy like poison. The young Willy Wonka is hilarious, and his face is covered by an astonishing mess of braces, headgear, and strange mouth contraptions. After a sad scene where the elder Wonka burns all of Willy's Halloween Candy, Willy becomes a rebel and a candy mogul.<br/><br/>This movie is a good, lighthearted movie that actually doesn't make you fall asleep... Not bad... Not bad..."
"vivianne-3","10","1","3","21 July 2005"," I thought this movie was fabulous
","Now first I'll have to say I was pretty loyal to the first movie so I wasn't really looking forward to seeing this new rendition. I loved the book as well and I just got used to the differences between the Gene Wilder version and the book, I guess. Anyway, as the movie started I was cringing and at first I thought Willy Wonka was retarded! LOL However, it only took about 10 minutes before I Depp's Willy Wonka really grew on me. After that I couldn't stop smiling and laughing throughout the whole movie. It does keep to the book (almost faithfully) and the addition of a side plot didn't take anything away from the movie for me. However, I wouldn't say that really added anything to the movie either...it was just sort of there. I was really afraid that Depp was going to be ""over the top"" like Jim Carrey (sp) and thankfully he wasn't. I thought he was just silly enough to be funny and he was serious enough to get the message across. Where Gene Wilder used a lot of words to get his message across in the old movie, Depp does the same thing with facial expressions that I found just hilarious. The children in the theater didn't seem to find it very funny. Strangely enough, only 3 of us adults laughed a lot too. I thought it was a perfect balance and I can't wait to see it again!"
"ferguson-6","7","1","3","21 July 2005"," Stop your Mumbling
","Greetings again from the darkness. With Tim Burton (""Edward Scissorhands"" ""Big Fish"", the underrated ""Beetlejuice"" and the underviewed ""Frankenweenie"") at the helm, there was little doubt that this version would follow the novel much closer than the original kiddie film with Gene Wilder and the torturous Sammy Davis, Jr song.<br/><br/>What was not anticipated was the eeriness Johnny Depp would bring to his portrayal of Wily Wonka. He is downright freaky and creepy!! It is amazing and captivating to watch Burton and Depp craft the story of the isolated man-child and his disgust with all things impure. Depp's performance drives the film to depths it would have otherwise not reached.<br/><br/>The sets are great, although the CGI are mediocre at best. Deep Roy as ALL of the Oompa Loompas is excellent although the difficulty in catching all lines of ""their"" musical numbers was disappointing. What we could hear was very funny. The great Danny Elfman produced another terrific score and also recaptured his Oingo Boingo days by writing and performing the Loompa numbers.<br/><br/>Overall, this is not an actor's film. However, in addition to Depp, young Freddie Highmore (captivating as Peter in ""Finding Neverland"") delivers a nice, hug-able performance as Charlie. Fine in supporting roles are David Kelly (""Waking Ned Devine""), Helena Bonham Carter, Noah Taylor (frighteningly real as Hitler in ""Max"") and the great Christopher Lee (veteran of over 200 films). The biggest disappointment was in the casting of the ""other"" kids and their parents. Surprised Burton couldn't do better.<br/><br/>This film is funny, touching and often surreal. As with the novel, it carries a message and is not meant for young children. Some of the dialog is difficult to hear (especially the songs) but there are plenty of laughs and WOW's!!"

","Who doesn't get excited about Depp/Burton projects? If you don't, there's something wrong. From the beginning of their combined efforts until the next (Corpse Bride), there's always something in the air at theaters that makes you giggly, because even if parts of the movie are terrible, Burton's fantastic vision of scenery, and Depp's.. Depp-isms will save it somehow.<br/><br/>And that's exactly where we place the Chocolate Factory movie.<br/><br/>Much has been said (by Gene Wilder and reviewers) about the need for this movie, but in Hollywood's lack of ideas, well, it was probably going to get done again soon enough, and at least they have something working for them: the writer of the script had never seen the first film until after he went back to the original books and wrote this movie. That means ladies and gentlemen, that you're not getting a movie based upon a movie as so many people are trying to tell you, but you're getting something that goes back to the source material (kind of like the three War of the World films that came out this year), and a new view on everything. It's not knocking Wilder or the insane midgets that scared me as a child, it's creating a new vision.<br/><br/>On we go pretending that you haven't heard this before: The story revolves around a young Charlie Bucket and his escapade through a tour in the museum that has just been re-opened by Willy Wonka. And right from the start of the tour, every little episode that looks awry also is silly, and perfect. From the fire set by the puppets, to the trained squirrels, everything looks so elaborately pretty. It's eye catching, it's the kind of thing that brings the kid out in you. You want to walk through that screen and dive into the chocolate waterfall, or eat the grass, so they say.<br/><br/>And amid few problems, the acting is decent in that ""light comedy"" way. It's never too boring for the older crowd with it's sometimes silly jokes that kids won't necessarily understand (beatniks and cannibalism!), or even it's Three Stooges comedy that caters to everyone. And no, Johnny Depp does not remind me of Michael Jackson. His Wonka is far from it really, but just because he's extra pale, talks with a high voice and is hanging around with kids, well that's enough for everyone else.<br/><br/>The best thing this had going for it to me besides the continued on screen awkwardness of Depp's strange man Wonka, and a fantastic performance (again) by Freddie Highmore, is that contrary to the commercials, I was not completely annoyed by the film as television has me believe. There's lots more to it than you're getting. They've saved all the good parts for the film (what trailers don't normally do), and it's fun. I left with a smile on my face afterwards, like many other kids will, and isn't that really what matters?"
"ladybugs811","8","1","3","21 July 2005"," A Pleasant...and Slightly Freakish Surprise
","I was ready to hate this movie. I am a loyal fan of Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory and opposed a ""remake."" However, I found this to be a completely new experience that I thoroughly enjoyed. Very true to the book, one of my childhood favorites, the film made me laugh, cry and squirm a little. Johnny Depp was brilliant, Freddie Highmore is absolutely charming and the rest of the cast was a little over the top at times, but good performance nonetheless. I am sure I follow many others who have seen the film when I say the Deep Roy, who played the Oompa Loompas, was incredible. No lines, just some funky dance routines and cameos here and there. When I read Charlie and the Chocolate Factory as a child, I loved the book. I had never seen Willy Wonka (which was made the year I was born) before reading it. So when I finally saw the film, I thought it was great, but then again, I was only 8. I think when I saw the first film, I forgot about the story told in the book because I was so mesmerized with the psychedelic (did I spell that right?) world I saw on screen. When I saw Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, I remembered how great the book was, because the movie is so true to the book. The first is a classic, but the second is definitely a winner!"
"migoyette","5","1","3","21 July 2005"," a ""bitter, tasteless confection""
","Saturday afternoon I went to see Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, a movie I'd been anticipating for about 2 years, since I first heard that Tim Burton was doing the remake. The first half an hour of the film wasn't bad, especially the opening credits scene, with the operation of the efficient machine arms stressing the factory's icy impersonality. I've always found automated factory machines working perfectly in sync to possess a kind cruel, sublime beauty--cruel and sublime because of the ugliness and soullessness inherent in the lack of human involvement, but spectacular and impressive nonetheless. At any rate, after those few initial scenes, I feel that the movie went quickly downhill, beginning at about the appearance of Wonka. This was no coincidence, as the portrayal of the character pretty much ruined the film for me. I have tons of respect and admiration for Johnny Depp, but I think he missed the mark here. His awkwardness felt forced or poorly conceived at many points. I just didn't buy this Willy Wonka; it didn't work for me. He seemed soulless, lacking true vitality. Maybe Depp wasn't the right choice to play him-- I don't know. Perhaps a Jim Carrey somewhat in the vein of Ace Ventura or The Mask would have been more convincing. I don't know. Marilyn Manson definitely would have been interesting, though I know nothing about his ability to act. But I don't place total blame on Depp, I think there were a lot of questionable directorial decisions behind the character that really doomed the movie from the outset. The ""p-p-parents"" phobia was an invention of this film, and one that I just didn't buy or understand the need for.<br/><br/>The ending of the film also annoyed me. Too cheesy and warm for a Tim Burton movie, a movie that spent most of its running time basking in the ""darkness"" of its take on the Chocolate Factory story. Also, the moral of Burton's story was way too spelled out, way too obvious. Come on, give the movie-goer some credit. But the real problem here was that Wonka's embracing of his father and conversion to ""family values"" was far too abrupt. There wasn't really any believable impetus for Wonka to suddenly change his stubborn, long-reclusive ways. I was also waiting for the elevator scene, with Charlie and his grandfather burping their way from annihilation, but it was most notably absent. I also thought it was a questionable decision to show the kids exiting the factory, especially Veruca Salt, who got off way too easy, shown with just a bunch of garbage on her. In this way the original film was much darker, leaving the kids' fate to the imagination of the audience.<br/><br/>The most poorly executed aspect of the film was the Oompa Loompas. Or the Oompa Loompa, rather, as they were all played by one guy whose height varied throughout the film. If you want to make the Oompa Loompa one foot tall, that's fine, if you want to make it three feet tall, that's fine too, but don't be inconsistent about it. At times, these glaring inconsistencies were apparent from one shot to the next. As a result, I found the Ooompa Loompas disorienting, distracting, and most of all, not believable. I'd also call it unprofessional. I can't believe that after years of production and round after round of editing, this was found acceptable and allowed to pass, especially for a film so clearly taken with its own aesthetics (if you watch carefully, you will also notice that when they are rowing the seahorse boat, the amount of Oompa Loompas in the boat varies during different shots--at times the boat is about 2/3 full with Oompa Loompas, at other points it is completely filled with them except for the portion of the boat where Willy, the kids, and their guests are sitting. A trivial error, but again, I don't understand how it gets past rounds of editing when I, a lowly movie patron, notice in on first watch). At any rate, I figure it's better to have weirdly painted, freaky little midgets like the original film than this movie's identical but shape-shifting rendition. I think the decision to have only one Oompa Loompa was a mistake, also; I didn't get the impression that there was an entire tribe working for Wonka. Oh yeah, I almost forgot to mention how much the Oompa Loompas' song and dance sucked. Annoying, distracting, non-catchy songs, and stupid movements that I could have choreographed myself. The one aspect of the Oompa Loompas that I did like was the entertaining back story the film gave them. Other such aspects of the film that I did enjoy (but were not nearly crucial enough to save it for me) include the 2001 references and subtle Edward Scissorhands shots.<br/><br/>Those are only a few of my many objections to this movie. I could go on and on...but enough of being a critic for now. Obviously, I feel rather strongly about this movie, and that is because I love both the original book and movie, and still felt that this remake had great potential with Tim Burton, Johnny Depp, and, of course, a can't miss storyline. However, I will take Roald Dahl's book or Gene Wilder's performance over this botched mess any day."

","I saw this movie yesterday and found it be one of the most enjoyable movie experiences I've had in a long time! Can't wait to see it again and pick up on all the little nuances I may have missed the first time around. I was a huge fan of the original as a child but looked upon this movie as simply a different interpretation. I smiled through the whole thing!! It is absolutely an imaginary feast for the mind and eyes. I can't understand some other peoples' inability to see this as: A.Not a remake but a new way of looking at this story, B. a whimsical story of fiction in which Not everything can be explained logically (I thought the father's house being 'ripped' out of its foundation to be hilarious!), and C. another awesome performance by Johnny Depp. He wasn't 'reading off the cue cards', people. He was playing the role as interpreted by Tim Burton and himself. Willy Wonka is a curious character who would be portrayed best in a quirky way. All said, I give it 4 stars."
"jeev7882","5","1","3","21 July 2005"," Disappointing Visuals and Poor Directoral Decisions.
","I did not have high expectations going in because the trailer did not look that great to me. Still, I was disappointed by Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. There were some funny moments, decent visuals, and Johnny Depp was incredible as always, but at the end of the movie I just did not feel anything.<br/><br/>First of all, and for the bazillionth time, this is not a remake of the 1971 Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory. They are both inspired by the same novel from Roald Dahl, but this version claims to be more faithful to the novel (which it's not). There is a lot I disliked about the movie, so here's a quick, yet descriptive, list of things: 1. Willy Wonka was ""given a point."" However, Charlie says ""Candy doesn't have to have a point. That's why it's candy."" Along the same lines, Willy Wonka doesn't need to have a point, but director Burton and writer August felt the need to make him more human for some reason.<br/><br/>2. The Oompa Loompa's were all one person (Deep Roy). They were creepy instead of cute and fun. There was no reason to have them all look the same.<br/><br/>3. Along those lines, the songs (except the Willy Wonka theme song) were horrendous. They were all like short acid trips. Then again, everything after the first 25 minutes was like a long acid trip.<br/><br/>4. It was visually bland for a Tim Burton film. It doesn't even look as good as the 1971 film. Everything looked like sets out of a Disney ride like A Small World. What happened to the guy that directed Batman and Edward Scissorhands? I'm not saying use CGI, but get a better set designer at least.<br/><br/>5. At the beginning the narrator declares that the story is about Charlie, and the movie is called CHARLIE and the Chocolate Factory. It turns out that Willy Wonka is the main focus and Charlie is just there to guide Wonka along his character arc. In fact, Charlie doesn't have any character flaws at all. I cannot recall what is flaw was in the book, but in the original Charlie and his Grandfather disobey Wonka and have the fizzy lifting drinks. It is Charlie's basic good nature that then redeems him for his misbehavior.<br/><br/>6. Danny Elfman, what happened man? Normally a fine composer, this score ranks as one of the worst I've heard in recent memory.<br/><br/>So, by now you're probably wondering, why did he give this movie a C+ instead of a D? Well, there were a few unexpected saving graces in the form of Johnny Depp and Freddie Highmore who plays Charlie. Charlie is the main character through the first 25 or so minutes of the film, but once we enter the chocolate factory Burton chooses to keep Charlie at an arm's length for some reason. Luckily, Highmore, who was great with Depp in Finding Neverland, is a good enough actor to keep us intrigued until he finds the golden ticket.<br/><br/>Once in the factor, Charlie virtually disappears beside Johnny Depp's much publicized creepy Michael Jackson imitation a.k.a. Willy Wonka. Aside from the high pitched voice and the pale face, there's really no Michael in this Wonka. Depp is famous for giving us memorable oddball characters and this one is no different. Is he creepy? Sure, but he's supposed to be. Wonka's weirdness is the only thing that kept me sane in the chocolate factory.<br/><br/>At the end of the day I was most dissatisfied because there was no magic. Every good kid's film needs to have something magical about it. I don't just mean that warm ooey gooey feeling inside from a happy ending, I mean that feeling you have after seeing movies like Beauty and the Beast or more recently, Finding Nemo. I realize that a live action children's film lives by different rules than animation, but that didn't stop movies like A Little Princess or even Willy Wonka from becoming classics.<br/><br/>If you have to see this movie, at least wait for it on DVD. There's no reason to go to the IMAX or your local neighborhood theater and empty your wallet for something as hollow as this."
"dgh10","8","1","3","20 July 2005"," Burton and Depp take a lot of risks -- most pay off, but some crash and burn.
","I liked this version of Roald Dahl's Charlie and the Chocolate Factory a lot. I thought it was well acted, particularly by all the members of the Bucket family. The sets were beautiful, and I liked the opening sequence. Freddy Highmore and Johnny Depp deliver excellent performances.<br/><br/>However, the Oompa Loompa songs made me cringe every time they started...they were so cheesy! Furthermore, although his acting was just fine, some of Deep Roy's dancing was pretty hideous. Of the Oompa Loompa songs, I thought Veruca's was the least bad, but I still would have preferred the movie without them. The rest of the music (Danny Elfman's score) was excellent, I thought, particularly at the beginning of the movie.<br/><br/>For me, the Oompa Loompa songs take the movie from a 10/10 to an 8.5/10. Johny Depp's acting was a little over the top at times for me, which takes it down another half of a point to 8/10.<br/><br/>Overall, it was a great movie: I think they took a lot of risks, and most of them paid off. Some of the risks crashed and burned, however, and hurt the overall film."
"dconklin721","7","1","3","20 July 2005"," I laughed a lot!
","I found Charlie and the Chocolate Factory to be a very enjoyable movie. I attended it with my wife, daughter and son-in-law and we all laughed a lot. I rated it 7 out of 10. A 10 out of 10 would be a movie that I would go back to the theater and see again. I will wait for the DVD to see it again. I really enjoyed the music and Johnny Depp's take on Willie. I think that the sound that Johnny Depp makes throughout the movie with his lips and tongue will be the next middle school fad for a while. It was kind of interesting to delve into Wonka's character with the flashbacks. Tim Burton's somewhat demented touch to the remake was wonderful, especially when the kids are first let in to the chocolate factory. I laughed the hardest at that scene just because it was so unexpected."
"necredeye","8","1","3","19 July 2005"," Its good, but...
","It could have been great. Johnny Depp is marvelous and Tim Burton is a master. But this just didn't come across as great. There was something missing. It could just be that the original was so fresh that it sticks with you for a long time, that when you're watching the new version, you're like 'well what about ...' or 'remember when...' But its still a good film. Johnny Depp is amazing as usual and his Wonka is a cool character, definitely weird, and mischievous. Visually, the movie is very fun and nice to look at. Again, its weird, but thats cool. A lot was made of this as being 'darker.' Yeah, some parts can be construed as darker, but I went in thinking the set designs were going to be like Sleepy Hollow. It is a film you can easily take a whole family too.<br/><br/>Overall, its a good fun flick I look forward to seeing again, although its not the best film of the year. (So far, for me, Batman Begins.)"
"sirdouglas46","8","1","3","18 July 2005"," Don't let the trailer keep you away
","I didn't want to see this movie because of the trailer. I thought it looked exactly like the original and thought Johnny Depp seemed like Michael Jackson and that he couldn't come close to the lovable weird character Gene Wilder brought us with that great scene where he does a somersault pretending to fall as he meets his young visitors. I was wrong or the trailer is wrong. The movie is pretty much an improvement on the original. The beginning sequence is a computer animated roller coaster trip through the production process of Wonka bars- great stoner fare. If I'm not able to find a Wonka bar at my local candy section the marketing for this movie is terrible.I always thought the old people that are Charlie's grandparents were too gross. Now, they are much more likable, yet still destitute. Grandpa Jo, played by David Kelly, gets more screen time than I remember because of scenes that explain how he used to work for Wonka before he closed his doors and replaced the workers with Oompa Loompas.I like the whole commentary about our post industrial fears. There is a scene that explains why Charlie's family is so poor. His dad, Mr Bucket- played by Noah Tayler who played the system designer that helps Tom Cruise's character realize that his life is not real in Vanilla Sky, works in a toothpaste factory. All he does all day is put tops on toothpaste tubes. So, as in real life he is replaced with a robot that puts his skills to shame: which is what the Oompa Loompas did to Grandpa Jo. I like the solution presented to this question of retiring skilled workers.<br/><br/>The real improvement, in terms of story is that you understand Willy's motivation to become a chocolateer better and why he is so weird. In the original the movie ends with Charlie and Willy flying in the magic elevator celebrating Charlie's role as the heir to Willy's work. A lot more of that backstory is put on the screen this time. The oompa loompas are better. Its actually just one guy- he played the evil lustful Princess Aura's pet Fellini in Flash Gordon back in 1980. Sorry for that reference it was the first and one of the few movies I've seen so much that I memorized it. He does the musical numbers chiding the bratty kids just like in the original but now he does it to different popular dance themes like disco and hair rock. The best part of this update is that I walked out of the theater with a clear understanding of the moral that its OK to integrate your post modern self back into the traditional family unit for the good of society. Even though, a lot of the film is frame by frame like the original, Johnny Depp saves the day by expressing a logic in his dislike for society that makes you chuckle time and time again. You may remember the character Mike TV? He is the violent kid whose real parent is technology. He aggressively questions the worth of everything and wants to take over because he thinks he's smarter than everyone else. Every time he says some snotty remark Willy asks him to stop mumbling, (which Mike isn't). I can't wait to try that trick out to bring some kid down a notch. The point is that you are going to get a rare treat when you celebrate your hate for mankind and feel like you are being conservative, as well, by accepting your weaknesses in order to reintegrate the family unit."
"nomad107","6","1","3","19 July 2005"," Well done, but not badly needed.
","I was impressed and quite entertained by this movie. Generally I don't think many remakes can compare to the original, but I think this one is still a good flick. It's funny, well acted (Johnny Depp is good but Gene Wilder will always be Willy Wonka), excellent costumes and production design, and the Oompa-Loompas are still a riot even if they aren't as memorable as their orange-and-green predecessors. However, my problem with the movie is that the original Willy Wonka was a great movie and didn't need to be remade. All of the filmmakers' time and money would have been better spent if they were creating something new and truly original."
"pridepanther","8","1","3","19 July 2005"," Bring your kids , but leave your doubts at home.
","If you've read the book, this film is a very honorable adaptation. Johnny Depp is simply awesome at portraying the eccentric yet lovable Willy Wonka. However, Freddie Highmore (Charlie) carries the film. His performance and delivery give this movie a stability that otherwise would have not been achieved by any other actor. His ability to make the audience relate and sympathize with his standard of living is worthy of applause. Coupled with this is a maturity that is astonishing and leaves the audience to wonder: If faced with the same decision, what choice would you make? This film is definitely family friendly for that message.<br/><br/>Another delight that this film delivers is a very satisfying back story to who Wonka is, and how he came to be. This is something that the previous adaptation had not explored. Given that, I would like to end by saying that comparing this film to the original is as unfair as comparing Batman(1989) to Batman the Movie (1966). Both are memorable."

","As ridiculous as this sounds I'm having a difficult time deciding whether I liked this movie or not ? I went in ( with my five and seven year old ) fully expecting something unique.The kids were familiar with the story and I knew they would enjoy it ""on their level "". I was excited because I get to see a kid's movie with Johnny Depp and a Tim Burton edginess. Finally a movie with the kids that I don't have to sleep through. Well, Johnny Depp was his normal unusual self and Tim Burton created his normal unusual sets but was it entertaining ? I had a few laughs , I was amazed at a few of the scenes ( especially the snow covered town shots ) , I loved the acting by Charlie but I was constantly a little disappointed by the lack of emotion. I truly respect movies that don't go for the sappiness but it was a children's movie - can't we have a little bit of charm ? When asked at work today what I thought of the movie I spent ten minutes going back and forth on what I liked vs what I did not like until I finally bored everyone into not listening. A five rating seems appropriate."
"bkelley-4","5","1","3","18 July 2005"," Good movie, but it totally lost the point
","I like remakes. I like Tim Burton. I like Johnny Depp. I didn't much like this movie though.<br/><br/>My gripes: They should have stuck to the original plot more closely. This was most pronounced in the ending of the movie, which was an absolute mess. The oompaloompas were annoying. The songs were even worse. When Gene Wilder was weird, it was cute. When Depp was weird, it was creepy. I guess that's Burton for you though. Depp almost reminded me of Jacko. I've heard of a bad egg and a bad apple. What's a bad nut?<br/><br/>My disdain for the plot changes didn't stop me from laughing at the funny jokes or enjoying the movie. Fair or not, I can't help comparing it to the original."
"RobynBelfry","3","1","3","18 July 2005"," You've seen it all before
","So much potential... and more of the EXACT SAME... Anti-Climactic, dull, forced, contrived... There was no element of suspense. It was like Burton was just pulling little tricks out of a bag. And like a grandfather who's pulled too many nickles out from behind my ear, the tricks are getting old.<br/><br/>The Danny Elfman score had some interesting elements... it's just a shame that it was difficult to make out any of the lyrics to the songs with all the effects placed on the Oompah-Loompah's voices.<br/><br/>All in all, I didn't have a bad time, but it could have been done a lot better. If anything, this was a middle of the road, uninspired adaptation with a few good moments. It's certainly nothing you haven't seen before. I think I'm finally done with Burton."
"d_nuttle","7","1","3","18 July 2005"," Funny and enjoyable
","I agree more or less with what Roger Ebert said about this movie: Depp's performance doesn't sink it. And I say that being, like Ebert, a big Depp fan. I was just marveling last night at his performance in ""Ed Wood."" I loved him in ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape?"", ""The Pirates of the Caribbean"" and a lot of other movies, too. But he goes off the rails in this one, and his Willy Wonka is just plain creepy and annoying.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, the movie has so many other treats that Depp's performance can't distract us for long. There's a boat, for instance--oh my, what a boat! I haven't laughed out loud that hard inside a theater for a long, long time. And Deep Roy as the Oompa Loompas is also memorable.<br/><br/>And then there are the squirrels. I have to say that the scene with the squirrels must be the single most imaginative, funniest idea Burton has ever come up with, and it is carried off perfectly.<br/><br/>And although Depp's character doesn't come off well, I don't want to make it sound like it's all bad. He is very funny at certain points. But he's funny in spite of his persona, not because of it.<br/><br/>So the movie has its flaws, but so did the original; that doesn't get in the way of it being enjoyable. To tell the truth, I think it would be impossible to make a movie of this story that didn't have its flaws. It's hard to be sure just what Dahl was getting at, if you ask me. So any interpretation will be open to question. The main thing is that it was fun for me, an adult, to watch.<br/><br/>I would have thought that certain scenes in the movie would have been too intense for very young children, but apparently very young children are all hardened these days, because not one of the toddlers in the audience made so much as a whimper at anything."
"Polaris_DiB","8","1","3","17 July 2005"," Very refreshing, surprisingly better than I expected
","The audience sits down as ten minutes of commercials scroll past, the separate groups waiting, intrigued and wanting to see Burton, Depp, and memories of Gene Wilder. The lights fade, everyone quiets, and I wonder why I spent money when I know I'm not going to like it... just look at Depp's annoying acting in the trailer! And I love Johnny Depp! Danny Elfman's score begins. I hate Danny Elfman, but of course he would be used, he's in every one of Burton's endeavors. A CGI factory makes CGI chocolate in what seems like a mockery of the same imagery used to make cookies in the beginning of Edward Scissorhands... the narrator starts; in Burton's typical fairy-tale style comes images of fairy-tale times with fairy-tale dilapidated old houses, and I'm really beginning to not like it until...<br/><br/>...it all sucks you in. You watch Charlie's family as they anticipate the finders of the Golden Tickets, and their quite acute comments on the nature of the winners. You watch as Charlie simultaneously tries to hide his hope and maintain it at the same time, along with his family's fluctuating eagerness to get a Golden Ticket. And as Charlie finds a ten dollar bill on the ground, you suddenly realize, ""Geez, this movie's a lot like the book... well, of course it was one dollar and not ten dollars, but who's really counting?"" And a lot like the book it stays, with a few minor deviations which frankly are brilliant. Wonka's flashbacks into his childhood are perfect addendums to Depp's quirky new creation of the beloved character that most could not separate from Wilder, and in the end Wilder's character is still maintained because he is not blaspheme'd. Johnny Depp and Tim Burton make a new Willy Wonka that is standalone enough that all thought of Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory becomes mere nitpicking by people annoyed by change.<br/><br/>In fact, considering the book, Willy Wonka movie, and Charlie movie, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is truly brilliant. It holds true to the book while still maintaining cinematic appeal by becoming it's own thing. It is not a remake of Willy Wonka, and thank God (or just Burton, as it was his choice anyways, right?) for that, because even though I like the older version, remakes are just incredibly tedious.<br/><br/>Special appeal to Burton fans would be the almost demented acting of Johnny Depp... the strange grins when kids get in trouble, the timid voice when he becomes unsure of himself, the reclusive germophobe he makes of a once maudlin and glurgy character. In fact, all the characters are perfectly translated to the screen, even if they do look like porcelain dolls from time to time (I hypothesize this comes from the drawings found in many of Rhoad Dahl's books).<br/><br/>Another great aspect of this movie is it's adherence to the musical bits in the book without really being a musical itself. Other than one other song, the Oompa Loompas sing everything, and though their music isn't really that good (I'd like to have it on a CD for laughs, but I don't really care for it otherwise), at least the situations are pretty funny, especially since all of the Oompa Loompas have the same face... and aren't like Munchkins.<br/><br/>As the movie progresses, it deviates more and more from the book, which is fine because it feels at that point like the trust has been salvaged. If people are still worrying about details so far into this movie, then I don't really see how they enjoy very many movies at all. About the time we reach the television room scene, it begins to feel a little tedious but right then wraps up everything pretty nicely (not to say there isn't more good stuff to come, but I'm not going to give away ALL the details). Eventually the credits roll, the audience is clapping and leaving, and I'm suddenly realizing, ""Wow, that was two hours... felt like two minutes."" A sure sign of a pretty good movie if there is one.<br/><br/>--PolarisDiB"
"pineapplesensei","5","1","3","17 July 2005"," Not as good as the original
","I've just seen this version of the class Rold Dahl story. I must say that I much preferred the original. However I'm sure that kids today, who haven't seen the 1970s version will enjoy this movie. There are plenty of adult targeted parts. Much of the music reminds one of other artists, such as Queen, the Monkees and the Beach Boys, yet it is not as catchy and memorable as the original. There were additions that added to the storyline and which gave the character of Wonka more of a background. This helps understand him a little more. The ending also continues further than the original, which ties it all up with a nice moral. Generally a good movie, though those who've seen the 70s version may be disappointed, and there are parts that may be scary for young children."
"Margot-33","7","1","3","16 July 2005"," Pleasantly surprised
","Previews made me want to avoid this movie but, because I am a Johhny Depp fan, I had to see it and I'm glad I did. Visually captivating, as usual in Tim Burton's films, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory transports you. The cast, from Charlie's family to the other children, impresses you with each contributing to the overall feel of the film. My least favorite were the Oompa Loompas- more specifically- their songs. Thankfully, they are short (the songs, that is). Although the lyrics I was able to figure out were humorous, they were, all the same, hard to hear. Some scenes seemed a bit mature in their sensibility but younger children should still be captivated.<br/><br/>Taken out of context, previews of Depp made him look freakish but in the movie he portrays Wonka as much more human than in Gene Wilder's interpretation. Depp has a brilliant sense of timing and it shows. Depp succeeded far beyond even my expectations but still, the movie is wonderful due to a great ensemble cast."
"SporkBoy","6","1","3","16 July 2005"," Not as bad as I feared, but could have been better.
","While I will admit that I've always loved the 1971 version, I was excited to hear that there would be a new one with Johnny Depp. Upon seeing the previews, I was ready for a big disappointment; luckily, it wasn't as bad as I had feared. But the main problems with it are big ones: the story and the direction.<br/><br/>The biggest difference between the two movies is subtlety. The Gene Wilder version is played on a much lower level; the jokes are under the surface, and the aspect of Willy Wonka as a person are visible if you look beneath his veneer of a weirdo. Tim Burton, playing true to form, decided to make Willy entirely into a weirdo, and removed any vestiges of a real person that existed; he also changed the style of humor into slapstick. So, in the previous movie, Gene Wilder's Willy seems to be having a private laugh at everyone else's expense; Johnny Depp's Willy doesn't care or understand what is going on, and everything about his life and the excursion with the children is completely arbitrary. Because it is so arbitrary, it means nothing and the audience has no reason to care about it.<br/><br/>The addition of Willy's relationship (or lack of one) with his father was an attempt by the writer and director to deepen Willy's character and turn him into a human being; it failed. What also failed was any attempt at chemistry between the parents and their children. None of them seemed in the least concerned for their children's' predicaments (with perhaps the exception of Mike Teavee's father, who seemed like a real parent who has trouble understanding his violent child); they were all like distant aunts and uncles who see their relations once a year.<br/><br/>With all that being said, the savior of this movie was Freddie Highmore, who took such a delight in the story that he brightened the screen whenever he was on it. He continues to give astonishing performances, and I feel that if the 1971 version had used an actor of his caliber it would have been even better."
"Cineanalyst","4","1","4","9 January 2020"," Pointless Candy
","An exchange between Charlie Oliver Twist and the TV kid here sums up TIm Burton's ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" quite well. Riding in the glass elevator through fireworks, Teavee asks sarcastically, ""Why is everything here completely pointless?"" To which the cloying simpleton Charlie circularly states, ""Candy doesn't have to have a point. That's why it's candy."" Stupid telly child, why one might as well inquire as to the point of any Tim Burton movie.<br/><br/>Based on the same book, the 1971 ""Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory"" worked on a couple levels. It was something of a parody of itself in its making fun of the culture surrounding television and candy. Much of the first forty-or-so minutes were devoted to this--even before Willy Wonka was introduced. Such humorous self-deprecation is largely dispensed with here in favor of zany looks, pratfalls and straightforwardly-debasing caricatures. The latter includes restoring some of the book's imperialist attitudes, what with the Indian prince stereotype and furthering the connotations to the history of African slavery with the Oompa Loompas (originally, Roald Dahl wrote them as African Pygmies) being discovered by Wonka in the jungle. And make what you will of this racial other all being made to look alike here.<br/><br/>The 1971 film also benefited, despite the name change in the title, from generally sticking with the perspective of Charlie. What we saw in the film, then, was the world as a child might perceive it. One where candy is currency, adults are nonsensical and capricious, contrivances seem magical and factories are amusement parks. In this 2005 movie, however, we also get Wonka's backstory, as remembered by him and as told by Charlie's grandfather, as well as too many other perspectives, which is ultimately cleaned up by the introduction of a narrator. The result is even more saccharine, too. But, the real problem is that the child's perspective is lost; in its place, we get what we always get in Burton's oeuvre: his perspective--unaccountably skewed and made-up to look goth. Oh, plus, there's the CGI, which merely makes the candy look like a cartoon.<br/><br/>Yet, I'll gladly rewatch this any day over what Burton did to Lewis Carroll's Alice books. They don't stray far from the source this time. Johnny Depp is at least slightly amusing as Willy Wonka, as opposed to his insufferable turn as the Mad Hatter. Casting Dracula himself, Christopher Lee, as a dentist is fangtastic. There are a few good verbal puns, too. And the candy-as-TV sequence is reimagined relatively well here compared to the 1971 iteration, including referencing ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" (1968), ""Psycho"" (1960) and pop-music bands. Indeed, there are quite a few references to other media sprinkled throughout--some being other Burton films or the usual gothic and horror-related pictures he likes to imitate. We first see Depp here reprising a pose from ""Edward Scissorhands"" (1990), for instance, whereas one unfortunate Oompa is transformed into Cousin It from ""The Addams Family."" But, yeah, mostly it's just completely pointless."
"Kimal9000","5","1","4","19 April 2019"," Burton an Depp takes it too far as usual
","Certainly this remake outdoes the original, and is somewhat more faithful to the great novel. But there's some serious flaws that prevents this from being a definitive version: The use of incessant and bizarre flashbacks is confusing and mostly lost on children.
Also, Depp's constant arrogance, sneering rudeness, and plain sillyness destroys the aloof authority he should have, and is absolutely not the way Willy Wonka carries himself in Roald dahl's book.
To me, all this ruins the warmth, the anticipative mystery, and the tingling magic you experience reading, or being read to, the book.
But all in all, a nice try! With lots of fun and Oompa loompa singing and dancing. But miles from what it should have been!"

The 'original' movie with Gene Wilder was an absolute travesty. I'm sure it seems like a cool film if you know nothing about the book, but as an adaptation of a classic, it omitted every bit of dark humour and the child's glimpse of the adult world that was Dahl's trademark. It isn't a cinema adaptation of the book, more a complete revamp for a Disney type audience. This Burton film, in my view, is a near perfect film imagining of the Dahl novel. Long overdue, it captures the essence of Dahl even better than the excellent James and the Giant Peach animated movie. Not only that, it is easily the best Burton film since Ed Wood, maybe even Edward Scissorhands, and places him back on the top of the list of Hollywood auteurs (to misuse a term). Dahl fans, Burton fans, rejoice! Fans of the Gene Wilder film, stay away."

","Charlie and the Factory (2005)<br/><br/>As a fan of Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory (1971), Tim Burton, and Johnny Depp, was excited to see this film. Though many people I talked to didn't like it, I personally loved it. It's not as good or as magical as the 1971 musical version but its still a lot of fun. It's a little strange because it's very colorful but at the same time its dark. <br/><br/>The story is much different than Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory. It follows a little closer to the book for the main details but adds some extras as well. It is also very child friendly, which you have to remember when seeing it. It's not like Sweeny Todd or Sleepy Hollow, so don't go in expecting it to be that style of Tim Burton film, it's like his Alice in Wonderland. <br/><br/>To the performances I must say that the role of Willy Wonka is not Johnny Depp's best acting but its certainly enjoyable. Very quirky and strange and a lot of fun to watch. All the children did great as well, Freddie Highmore, and AnnaSophia Robb especially. <br/><br/>Charlie and the Chocolate Factory has very interesting CGI. It's not necessarily very realistic but it's also not very noticeable because even the people seem kind of fake due to the make up. <br/><br/>One complaint I have, and I think others do too, is the Oompa Lumpas. Not so much because it's the same person playing all of them, (I didn't mind that too much, just a little at first) my main issue is with the songs. I liked the idea of them singing and all of that, they just weren't very good and got a little annoying, unlike the classics in Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory. <br/><br/>Overall Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is very fun, light hearted, and a great film. Once you start watching it's hard to look away. Fans of Depp and Burton should enjoy it as long as they realize that it is rated PG so it is more directed towards kids, but is still easily loved by adults. <br/><br/>8/10"
"sitonpickle","5","1","4","11 December 2009"," OK movie
","Before I begin what I have to say about this movie, let me say that I will not compare this to the 1971 version, I will only compare it to the book that surprisingly a lot of people say this is more faithful to...<br/><br/>The movie was good in the beginning with the Charlie and his family, all the stories about that grandpa Joe told were in the book and it followed the book very well. When the golden tickets were sent out and one at a time a kid finds one, I didn't like how the kids are, Veruca isn't very demanding for what she wants like in the book, Mike Teevee is NOT LIKE EINSTEIN in the book, Violet is not athletic and confident in the book. <br/><br/>As soon as all the children get into the factory the movie started to get worse. Johny Depp's portray of Willy Wonka was not at all the Willy Wonka in the book. Yes I know Willy Wonka is suppose to be a crazy genius like in the book, but Depp's Willy Wonka wasn't like that, Depp's Wonka was bizarre, annoying, childish and pitiful. The looks of the candy room are beautiful and mouth watering, but I didn't like the kid's expressions for the place. They were all in the most ""amazing place on earth"" and they looked bored except for Augustus Gloop. <br/><br/>What really kicked this movie away from the book is the added subplot about Wonka's past, it was so unnecessary and took Charlie away from the plot for a while. <br/><br/>The children didn't really make a whole lot of sense in many ways, especially in the ooompa loompa songs; Violet is a girl that is very athletic, yet the oompa loompas say she ""sits around chewing all day long"", Mike Teevee is really smart! He's apparently the only one on the earth that knew how to find a Wonka bar with a golden ticket, and yet he's a video gamer and his brain is ""soft as cheese"" and ""can not think"". The kids in the book weren't like the kids in this movie except Charlie, Augustus and possibly Veruca. <br/><br/>The overall mood of the story is not like the world the book brings you in. The book wasn't really that dark, but is wasn't very happy either, sort of in between and yes the book had it's dark moments but the rest was just normal. This movie tried to capture a different world, the lighting was way too dark, the factory was made to look dark and scary and Willy Wonka was freaky looking.<br/><br/>The thing I felt was the most faithful to the book was the Oompa Loompa songs, Danny Elfman did a good job taking the lyrics from the book (even though he left out a lot) and singing them they way they should sound."
"elshikh4","5","1","4","10 August 2009"," So it's ""Charlie"" this time not ""Willy Wonka""?.. WRONG !
","I asked myself a lot why Tim Burton made this movie? Is he only making a living through movies? Not Burton that I know. Is he trying to remake a story with a precise different point of view? This is what I didn't find here at all! So is he making the studio what it wants, so the studio would give him later the chance to do what he wants? That's the closest I can get to a satisfying answer!<br/><br/>It's just another one from the mammoth mound of remakes that Hollywood, the bankrupt Hollywood lately, produces in the 2000s just to produce. And, unfortunately, it didn't even get the Burton stamp on it, being tasteless and unsurprising, with nothing that original as well. So you can say confidently that this is Tim Burton's Planet of the Apes (2001): Part 2!<br/><br/>It was between so ordinary and provocative, and I think ordinary Burton's movie is provocative enough! For instance, about the provocation part, you'll find Johnny Depp performing badly in a rare time. Just think of it; Willy Wonka, as we knew by this very movie, was one self-made millionaire, who left his home while he was a kid, to end up building an empire of candy industry, however, Depp's performance showed Wonka as one sissy brat; who's close to Michael Jackson's image as an inordinate weirdo only!<br/><br/>The movie invests the CGI in the worst way ever. Making all the Oompa Loompa as one ugly and glum midget was a historical stroke of stupidity. Aside from his too silly emotionless face, that was so BORING. It was mere showing off. And it didn't serve the darkness of the story; it served my tedium out of it. Let alone that seeing Deep Roy parodying Ester Williams's big numbers was completely awful and sickening!<br/><br/>Overall, it misses imagination. I didn't find anything that new to savor. And it's quite a shame when that is said about a movie by the one who made once Beetle Juice, Edward Scissorhands, or Mars Attacks! I liked the ominous intro of the burning dolls, but the thing is there wasn't more.<br/><br/>Still the biggest irritation comes from the deception of making the movie this time about Charlie not Wonka. Whereas we've watched carefully Mr. Wonka's history so his gratuitously nauseating journeys, his psychological problems, even the way he gets saved at the end, while Charlie was more present in the old movie, with songs and memorable moments. It's more than obvious that this is a Johnny Depp movie from start to finish, and it wasn't interesting as its likes too.<br/><br/>Moreover: Danny Elfman's music lacked its own uniqueness. Surely this movie isn't appropriate for kids; enough to remember the pupils come out of the dolls' eyes while they're on fire! And Albert Finney, Anthony Hopkins, Paul Newman were considered for the role of Grandpa Joe?? And in early 2003, Gregory Peck was offered the role!! How the movie makers got the guts to consider all of these icons, or even offer the role to a legend as big as Peck, while it's basically a trash of a role that got totally nothing to its actor??!!<br/><br/>Most of the songs were OK. And it was good to see the history of Wonka, criticizing the TV, or utilizing Wonka's elevator as a fancy transportation. It was even very good to cast Dracula himself, Christopher Lee, as his terrifying father. Yet all of that didn't give me the original movie that I wished for. It was only the ""new"" message of the family being more important than money that this movie succeeded at delivering, but without any comic moments or even enjoyably dark ones.<br/><br/>When you watch useless remakes everyday is something really woeful, but when it comes to one of the few REAL ORIGINAL movie makers too; so that deserves a stark WOE. It's not Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, or Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, it's Tim Burton and the Remakes Factory, being the least amusing and the true melancholic in the bunch."

","It was just not a good movie. It looked promising at the beginning, but the script was terrible and the plot was just stupid and contrived. Johnny Depp is a genius, don't get me wrong, but the movie just wasn't good. The Oompa Loompas' songs were absolutely terrible and they made me sick to the stomach. The Oompa Loompas were definitely the worst part. That and the horrible pretense of back story. The ""daddy was a dentist"" part was just silly and really really artificial. Speaking of artificial, the face of the German boy at the beginning looked like he was animated by Disney in the 1960's. Overall, it was just a creepy and unsettling failure, saved only by Johnny Depp. Did I mention how terrible and awful the Oompa Loompas were?"
"ippadi","7","1","4","17 August 2006"," What happened to the Oompa Loompers?
","I went to see this film not expecting it to really live up to the original but I was somewhat surprised. The film definitely contains more scenes taken straight from the book, which is great to see as so many films adapted from books lose their brilliance. The visual effects were great and the chocolate factory was more outlandish than in the first film and appears much more like a child has imagined the entire design. The only major fault I found with this film were the Oopma Loompas, or Oompa Loompa. In the original film they are far superior, in this version I found them slightly creepy, or maybe that was the intention of the directors. The fact that they were all played by the same actor added to the creepiness for me. The Oompa Loompa's songs were also disappointing. Gone were the catchy tunes they had previous sung that stuck in your head for days on end, replaced instead by what can only be described as 'noise'. Overall I give this film a 7/10 as the acting was great and so was the story. I recommend it for children and adults alike, as long as you are prepared for the Oompa Loompa catastrophe."

","I'm not sure that I've ever finished a film feeling so violated as I did watching the latest cinematic offering of the increasingly boorish and tedious Tim Burton.<br/><br/>From start to finish, the film seemed utterly bent on inducing vomit in the viewer, from Depp's creepy pallor and doll-like features (there was something fundamentally wrong with the scene where he admits with a school-boy demeanour and submissiveness to his father that he had not flossed in all the years they had been apart), to the sets, to the hammy dialogue right to the repugnant children. OK, we can accept that the ""innocence of childhood"" is fast becoming a thing of the past if we like, though I was a precocious child of the 80s, I liked to play violent video games, but I doubt my being would have inspired such disgust as Burton intended to inspire with the stock, precocious American child. I'm not sure I've ever seen a child simply being a child be so thoroughly demonised on screen. It's as if Burton would not be satisfied until the audience was collectively screaming for this kid to be dismembered. There was absolutely no mirth in it, no sense of appropriate playfulness, to go with this hyper-depressing message. The film was utterly self-defeating.<br/><br/>Aside from this, the film lacked all the wit of the first, and the set pieces would, ironically, only have pleased the most ADD-addled child.<br/><br/>Everything is presented in the most simple, literal fashion, from excess to poverty to familial disjointedness; we are smacked over the head with all of these aspects of the story, and I for one was left only cold.<br/><br/>I'm usually fond of Depp, but his version of Wonka is another ADD benefit show, though it was probably mostly Burton's ""vision"" of him, as some ultra-closeted Michael Jackson of the surreal world. Wilder's Wonka was more sympathetic, and likable despite his faults, and we did not need the slapdash plot-thickening and really quite ridiculous back story for that, just a sense of a despairing, reluctant adult with lost ambitions, which Wilder brought to the screen with perfect grace.<br/><br/>Another point is the original film was largely a projection of the current world, with it taking on more old fashioned characteristics in some areas, and some hyper-futuristic aspects in others. It was a mix, but the parts themselves were at least faintly recognisable in some way, and this was not the case with Burton's. The world is sloppy, fairy-tale kitsch, with a fully sign-posted story journey.<br/><br/>I, for one, hated it, and have no idea where Burton thought he could inject anything new into the old story. All he did was butcher the more endearing aspects of the original film, whilst packing it with his ego and dull sense of righteousness."
"Buddy-51","4","1","4","2 May 2006"," dull, clumsy remake
","Tim Burton, normally one of the most innovative and inspired of modern American filmmakers, comes a cropper with ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,"" a cold and crass adaptation of the beloved children's story by Roald Dahl. This is actually the second filming of the work, the first being the charming and delightful 1971 film renamed ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"" to give Gene Wilder the title role.<br/><br/>In this remake, Johnny Depp takes on the part of the famed chocolate manufacturer who decides to open up his factory to the first five children who find a gold ticket in one of his bars. Charlie is the sweet-tempered young boy who is the fifth to do so, and, thus, gets to take the tour along with four other obnoxious brats who have none of the purity of spirit he does.<br/><br/>""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" fails to make us care about either the situation or the characters. Depp plays Wonka like a bizarre cross between Michael Jackson and Carol Burnett, and Burton, even with all his attention to detail in the sets and special effects, is unable to distract is from the fact that not a whole lot is really going on in the film. The early scenes, involving Charlie's eccentric relatives and their attempts to secure the ticket for him, have a warm, familial feel to them, but once the tour itself begins, we become as imprisoned in the claustrophobic setting as the characters themselves.<br/><br/>Locked in a tedious monotony, the plot essentially consists of Wonka, the children, and their respective parents moving from room to room where each of the four brats meets up with his or her well-deserved comeuppance in the form of a bizarre factory accident, until only sweet little Charlie is left. Interspersed throughout are a series of inane song-and-dance sequences a la Busby Berkeley and uninteresting and undramatic flashbacks to Wonka's deprived and unhappy childhood that are somehow supposed to explain why he has become the creepy character we find at the center of the story.<br/><br/>The art direction and set decoration are fine but not impressive enough to make us overlook the dullness and unpleasantness of so much of the film. Mr. Burton may need to go back to making the kind of small, quirky films that he cut his directorial teeth on and leave these empty, bloated big screen extravaganzas to others."
"rooprect","3","1","4","5 February 2006"," Not as intellectual as the original
","If you have already seen the 1971 classic, I believe you will hate this version. Tim Burton has taken a children's story and produced just that: a children's story. But those of you familiar with the original Willie Wonka will agree that it was really a very adult movie, full of Shakespeare (mis)quotes, subtle references to Rachmaninoff (which was actually Mozart! heh heh) and of course the infamous chicken decapitation. You'll get none of that here. Instead you'll get a lot of CGI special effects, some slapstick gags and a few showtunes. You know, stuff that the kids might enjoy.<br/><br/>You will invariably find yourself comparing Johnny Depp to Gene Wilder, and I must say--even though Johnny Depp may be the finest actor of his generation--he's no Gene Wilder. In fact in this role I'd say he laid a rotten egg. In his efforts to portray a squeaky-clean, plastic caricature of a human, he went too far and sacrificed character development. We care nothing for the new Willie Wonka, for he is not even human any more than Michael Jackson is (and what's with the annoying Teletubbies voice he uses?). Beyond that, the mediocre dialogue and weak jokes aren't enough to carry our interest further.<br/><br/>For me, though, the worst part of the movie was something many people may overlook. The music was awful! Danny Elfman, who wrote the classic tunes for ""Nightmare Before Christmas"" as well as the playful ""Peewee Herman"" soundtrack and the majestic orchestration for ""Batman"", has churned out an utter flop for this film. The musical numbers are embarrassingly silly with lyrics that are as predictable as they are stupid. And his attempts at writing grunge and techno are just... well... bad. I would prefer 90 minutes of ""Cheer Up Charlie"" to this lame stuff.<br/><br/>Am I glad I saw this film? No. Do I wish I had the last 2 hours of my life back? Yes. But if some good has come of this disappointing experience, it's that I now appreciate the original even more. Tim Burton, if you're listening... please, no more remakes! I though you had learned your lesson with Planet of the Apes."
"googlesplatted","4","1","4","28 January 2006"," So disappointing
","I love Tim Burton, and I love Johnny Depp...but this version of Roald Dahl's classic book left me disappointed and frustrated. Where was the originality? Almost everything - the set and costume design especially - was like a 2005 Burton-ised version of the early Gene Wilder movie. The chocolate waterfall room is described in the book as a beautiful valley lined with graceful trees, rhododendrons and meadows filled with thousands of buttercups. Once again, however, the movie version delivers a flouro coloured set complete with lollipop trees, etc.. Although a spectacular design in itself, I'm sure this is not what Roald Dahl would have wished for.<br/><br/>As for the Ooompa-Loompa: why, Tim, why! Once again we have Ooomp-Loompas (all the same guy) wearing flouro coloured, shiny jump-suits following robotic dance steps. Why couldn't we see what Dahl intended - families of Ooomp-Loompa hunters wearing animals skins, carrying spears and singing along to beating drums? There was a great chance here to create something really special and true to the original book. Innocent, joyful - but of course with that deliciously nasty Dahl streak. Instead, we have a horribly Hollywood-ised, over designed copy of another movie (which Dahl didn't like in the first place). Why did Wonka have to become the main character (with an unnecessary inserted back-story), once again? Charlie was hardly in the film at all. And why was Willy Wonka American? If you know Dahl's books, you'll know that he would have been appalled by the thought of an American Wonka. Dahl was English, through and through, and so are most of his main characters.<br/><br/>The squirrels were the highlight of the film. All credit where it's due there.<br/><br/>I'm sure kids will enjoy this film. But I'm just a 'big kid' myself after all, and I grew up loving Dahl's books. I was sorely disappointed with this film. Ow! I so wanted it to be good!"

I also liked Johnny Depp's Wonka about half the time. The other half I wanted to strangle him. He drove me nuts and he also kind of looked like a middle aged lesbian. Or Michael Jackson. Either way....yikes.<br/><br/>My thoughts on the candy room are as follows: In the original I wanted to be there, I salivated just looking at it. This one kind of looks like an alien experiment gone wrong. Not appetizing at all.<br/><br/>Final word: Why not just make a movie about the book's sequel instead of trying to revive something that's already still very much alive. It pains me to know that the next generation will be more familiar with this than with the Gene Wilder classic."

"ravenmosher","10","1","4","17 August 2005"," Charlie and the Chocolate factory; a mouth full and a half
","The problem with Tim Burton's latest movie Charlie and the Chocolate factory was you could not help but compare it to the original Movie, or if you haven't seen it, the book. <br/><br/>The movie begins with a CGI thing about how the chocolate is made and how the five tickets got into the chocolate and really, it just wasn't needed but was still a nice touch. It was impressive as far as computer graphics go.<br/><br/>Although this new one is far more closer to the book, and had the more recognisable Roald Dhal Charm, Tim Burton has yet again added his own little signature as he does in all his movies. I could not help but look at the candy sticks while in the candy meadow scene, it kept reminding me of the cliff that jack stands singing on from Nightmare Before Christmas. Look at them and see for yourself! They're exactly the same! I'm not saying that was a bad thing, but it was rather distracting. One thing I loved about the movie was that Willie Wonka was slightly scared of the children, and people in general. He had no idea how to greet them and had to read off flash cards that no doubt were written for him by the oompa loompas. And plus, the audience hated those children and therefor related to Willie as he obviously hated them too. (apart from Charlie of course) He hid behind a smile most of the time but you could tell. Being in isolation for fifteen years will do that to you. Still, I think he should of been a little more reluctant to meet Charlie's family. Don't get me wrong, Jonny Depp did a great job, as he always does and although a lot of the expressions reminded you a lot of Jack Sparrow from Pirates and a hell of a lot of Micheal Jackson for some reason (coincidently Willie Winka also reminded me of the Child catcher from chity chity bang bang for some other odd reason.) it was closer to Roald Dhal's character than I expected. I did miss some of Gene Wilder's carefree not bothered attitude about and how perfectly normal his factory was to him. Jonny kind of emphasised on how weird the factory was and how twisted and mentally ill Willie himself was. What was with the flash backs? Were they to explain why Willie was the way he was or just to say, here's why this guy is off his head! ""I'm so sorry I...just had a flash back. Hee hee.""<br/><br/>""...Do these flash backs happen... often?""<br/><br/>""On with the tour! K?"" Really, that wasn't needed. A character is nuts just because he is nuts. He lives in a chocolate factory for God's sake. You need no explanation.<br/><br/>I just didn't like the ghost white skin which by the way got paler and paler all the way through the movie. There were laughs and the odd joke, but unusually, it wasn't actually a children's movie as such. Not because of the Pg they slapped on it, but I think little six year olds would be a bit freaked out by the melting puppets. (I know I was although I thought they deserved it.) The bit when the boy got sucked up the chocolate pipe thing wasn't that different from the original movie really so nothing new there. The squirrels attacking Veruca Salt was a little...yikes though. Do children really need to know how violent squirrels can be? After all most children cannot decipher reality from fantasy these days. And blowing up like a blue bery and then become as flexible as chewd chewing gum? No wonder our children are disturbed these days. But then, that's the thing about Roald Dhal. And Tim Burton in fact. Reality and fantasy merging together. There's no fine line.<br/><br/>Another thing that surprised me was how emotional the movie was. It didn't quite fit. Willie would suddenly seem to have some sort of panic attack and mumble something about his father. It was the root of the movie's dark side really, and it kind of got you off guard. It was the only thing really that kept you watching the movie.<br/><br/>All in all it was a very charming Tim Burton creation and was written quite well, just a lot of it wasn't needed and seemed to just make the movie longer than it needed to be. I'm a bit mixed about it really. I'll say this though; I was not disappointed. Do not compare it to the original movie. That will spoil it for you."

","Tim Burton's Charlie & The Chocolate Factory is a superb rendition of Roald Dahl's classic... both Burton & Depp deliver with a film that entertains all ages and remains faithful to both the words and the spirit of a story about a poor, wonderful little boy. I've heard a lot of comments concerning the comparisons between Willy Wonka & The Chocolate Factory and the new film; many critics have expressed some disparaging comments (i.e. IT WAS TRASH!!!) about the new film, saying it was not true to the earlier movie... my suggestion would be this: READ THE BOOK! These two movies, while both excellent, are similar in only the inspiration of their plot lines. While the older film starring Gene Wilder follows the basic plot, Charlie, Uncle Joe, and Wonka's characters have been greatly changed. There are additional dramatic themes and enemies (Slugworth is only mentioned in the book; he does not take an active role; there is no contract to sign either). The Tim Burton film, while straying from the story line with flashbacks and a new ending, is much more representative of Roald Dahl's book.

","Another remake it may be, but this is that rare feat, an improvement. Gene Wilders enjoyable romp has been improved upon by Tim Burton who stays more faithful to the source material while creating the world of Dahl's creation with no expense spared. The sets built in this film are immense and it is mostly set work thankfully. Something which Burton does that I like is to always think ""in camera"" rather than fall back on CGI too much.<br/><br/>Burton is a visual maestro. He is quirky and highly creative and his sensibilities of dark humour really mix well with Dahl. Only Burton and also Terry Gilliam could really have done this film true justice in the modern era, and Burton does just that. The film is magical, well done and really brings the best out of Dahl's best work. The factory is wild, expressionistic as is the Buckets house. While between Burton's vision and Johnny Depp's effortlessly diverse acting skills, the character of Willy Wonka is brilliantly realised, matching Gene Wilders equally great performance toes to toe. Like Gene Wilder, Depp gives the character a kind of creepy aura, and a sense of a dark underlay. While Wonka is a strange and reclusive figure he certainly seems to have a darker side, an almost sadistic edge. Depp brilliantly portrays this. The thing that makes Johnny Depp arguably the best actor of his generation is that every role is different, wildly different, so diverse and always brilliantly portrayed. Even gods like Pacino, De Niro and Nicholson can often seem to be playing the same old characters over again. His portrayal of Wonka may earn Depp his third consecutive Oscar nomination after years of being criminally ignored.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast are all good, with good child performances as the suitably gruesome foursome to enter the factory with Charlie. David Kelly is also superb as Grandpa Joe. However perhaps the star of the show is youngster Freddie Highmore, who previously impressed in another Depp film, Finding Neverland. Highmore surely enters the pantheon of excellent child actors, a pantheon that is sadly not heavily populated. However Highmore really is good. He has a hard role here, no question because while Charlie is a quiet and affable character it is a performance that demands subtlety and acting without dialogue and Highmore does this brilliantly. He is the heart of the movie and gives a performance of shockingly immense gravitas. He can have no higher praise than to have been recommended for the part of Charlie by Depp.<br/><br/>Danny Elfman delivers one of his best scores in years and it adds to the magic of the film. This is a good piece of work and a welcome return to full on Burton. Definitely his best film since Sleepy Hollow. ****"

","Making comparisons to the 1971 film is unavoidable if you've seen it. However, Tim Burton's version follows Dahl's book far more closely.<br/><br/>I heard lots of negative things about this film and not much positive, but my wife and I went to see it anyway, based on our interest in the first film and our appreciation for Roald Dahl. Burton's movie went FAR beyond my expectations in every area, and it solidified his place in my mind as THE filmmaker of our generation.<br/><br/>As always, Johnny Depp is right on...though nothing like Gene Wilder's Wonka, Depp creates a quirky but lovable chocolatier who seems to have a dark past not evident in the '71 film...instead of a loving, almost paternal figure, he is the full-grown child Dahl portrays in the book...to those who have read it, this is a welcome approach.<br/><br/>The Bucket family are a lovable bunch, the other Golden Ticket winners are as annoying as you'd expect, and the visual impact of the film is Burton at his best. Though some of the CGI is distracting (one character's ""metamorphosis"" in particular...), the visual effects are appropriate and effective. As in all of Burton's films, the art direction is phenomenal.<br/><br/>Another hot topic is the Oompah Loompahs...we loved them! Nothing like the '71 version, thankfully, and Burton's factory workers give us musical morals that are unique and humorous, as opposed to the hypnotic (and powerfully annoying) material written for the '71 film.<br/><br/>Speaking of music, Danny Elfman strikes again...by all accounts he is the standard by which today's film composers should be judged. His music is haunting, original, unique, and it consistently amplifies the emotional intent of the film.<br/><br/>Overall, this is the best film we've seen in quite a while...as we left the theater, we discussed the purchase of the DVD version. See it immediately!"

","This movie was absolutely wonderful. Hands down it was great. No doubt about it. I thought Johnny Depp did an awesome job in this. I would have to say I loved this movie more then ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"". The way the room with the pool of chocolate was set up, I thought was phenomenal. Although Missy Pyle plays a small part in this movie, she added some humor to it as well. The oompa loompas absolutely made the movie as great as it is. I can't get over the fact that Willy Wonka was actually Johnny Depp. The make up on him was absolutely wonderful. This is a movie you just have to see. You most defiantly wont regret it."

","I have to say this film was amazing, talk about entering your childhood fantasies. With many films at the moment there is lots of fighting and violence but this film is so innocent and I can't imagine anyone being able to find fault with the story line. Roald Dahl is one of the greatest writers of children's book and this film has really managed to catch what I think Roald Dahl was always trying to get across to children. He tried to make his stories fun, entertaining and full of excitement, which this film does not lack. The film was better than the original which I thought was going to be hard to beat. The characters were all very well played and the sets used where spectacular. The story was a little different to the original with lots of twists and turns along the way like a very exciting roller-coaster. Johnny Depp made an amazing appearance in the film, showing his talent at acting. While keeping the character of Willie Wonker child like and innocent he managed to add a hint of mystery and darkness to the character. I enjoyed the new Oompa Loompas i felt they were very modern and it added a new twist, to all be so identical. They even seemed to manage to mirror the darkness of Willie Wonka. The five children also made the movie extremely enjoyable with there amazing ability to get across the characteristics of each character. Overall I feel this is worth a 10/10 and is well worth the cinema money and worth a watch, whether you are young or old you will get some enjoyment out of it. I don't think I have been to a film where all the people laugh at the same points and where everyone comes out with a smile on their face. I also recommend the chocolate they are selling it is really very nice so why not buy some chocolate and see the best film by far this month."
"FilmOtaku","8","1","4","5 August 2005"," A worthy remake
","Much has been made about whether or not ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"", directed by Tim Burton, was even necessary. The original film about Willy Wonka, Mel Stuart's ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"" (1971) is a bona fide classic, so it was inevitable that there would be some trepidation in the wake of a remake. Fortunately, Tim Burton not only is the best man to helm the project, but the film, while having many similarities to be sure, does differ substantially from Stuart's.<br/><br/>There are going to be inevitable comparisons to the original film, and whether or not this is entirely fair, one cannot help but look at some main similarities and differences. Both films certainly have fantastically odd set designs, though (perhaps being a product of its time) the original is pretty psychedelic. It is hard to describe Tim Burton's sets in most of his fantasy films, though he has made enough of a name for himself in that he's probably been used as an adjective (A set being ""Burton-esqueÂ… I know I've personally used this phrase). The Bucket's house is impossibly slanted and the ""garden"" in the beginning of the factory tour is not just colorful, but looks like Dali designed it. Burton has traditionally made some really slick looking films, and his style is just as present in this one. One of my favorite scenes in particular was in the sterile room where Mike Teevee meets the end of his tour. The stark white is the same from the original film, but there was something about the presentation, from the lighting to the funky goggles they were wearing, that made me really take notice. The many different Oompa Loompas were replaced with the hilarious Deep Roy (superimposed on many bodies), with songs that were not only updated and more contemporary, but ones that were mostly written by Dahl himself. Unfortunately I am at a disadvantage in that I have not read the book and therefore am not certain which script changes (from the original) can be attributed to Burton's production or to the book itself, but I really enjoyed the background information on Wonka; it not only gave him a more human appeal (despite his bizarre appearance) but really gave the production more depth than I felt the original had.<br/><br/>When I first heard about this project last year, and learned that Depp had signed on as Wonka, I was really excited because I firmly believe that not only is he one of the greatest contemporary actors working, but he and Burton are the greatest actor/director team in decades. Both people, while they have shown their versatility (mainly Depp) are better known for their creativity, and as a result, every project they have done together has been nothing short of spectacular. There is no way to compare the performances of Gene Wilder, the original Wonka and that of Depp because they are very different and both great, but I can aver that any trepidations that some may have about whether he can do the part justice are quashed in about 30 seconds. Made up with ghoulishly white face makeup on a chiseled face that looks like it could cut stone, with a toothy grin and a shiny straight pageboy hair cut, if Depp were about two degrees more frightening-looking, he would be nightmare fuel. His portrayal of Wonka and his ironic dislike of children is less sarcastic and more phobic. He clearly doesn't feel anything but disdain for most of the children, but deals with them on an almost childish level himself, spouting out ""Ew's"" and bickering. His equal dislike of the parents is just as funny, but it all comes together, psychologically, with the inclusion of his own back-story. Freddie Highmore is, frankly, adorable. Emitting SO much more charm than Peter Ostrum, the original Charlie Bucket, he not only shows that he can act, (though I discovered this while watching ""Finding Neverland"") but he can charm the pants off an avowed kid hater. (That would be me) When I saw this film, I was with my boyfriend and a friend of ours, and I believe that we were the only ""adults"" in the theater who weren't accompanied by kids. Yet, I found that while everyone in the theater seemed to be enjoying the film, it was the three of us who laughed the loudest. The original film was wicked at times, but I think that ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" had moments where it was downright evil, and I thought the whole film was (no pun intended, really) simply delicious. There are few films where I sit through them with a big dumb grin on my face throughout, (""Moulin Rouge"", any Coen Brothers film comes to mind) and this one definitely goes on the short list. There are so many appealing elements to this film that make it, in my opinion, an instant classic, and a film that is as kid-friendly as the original. That is to say, the kids will like it, but the adults watching it with them are going to pick up on how twisted it really is. 8/10 --Shelly"
"mrbmum33","10","1","4","2 August 2005"," Better then the original
","I've read a lot of negative reviews on Depp's performance. I think he nailed it! Willy Wonka is NOT the child loving candy maker as seen in the earlier version. He is a complicated and somewhat sadistic character who longs to teach children and their parents a lesson. Who could Wonka be other then a psycho, or as wealthy people say...eccentric? If people think Wonka invited those five children into his factory for just childish fun and games then they are seriously mistaken. Mr. Depp showed the true intent of Willy Wonka in that people fall by their own selfishness! People should compare each movie to the original book and not one movie to another. Walking in, I thought this movie would win on special effects alone.... I was wrong. It wins on message and character development, as special effects come in second. I will buy this movie on DVD and that says A lot considering I own two DVD's.<br/><br/>Brian Mumm"
"Bryani_j","10","1","4","1 August 2005"," Fabulous Film!!!
","Absolutely fantastic film. Different interpretation of the book, but still keeps all the main thread of the story. I have heard reports that Johnny Depp is been slated for his betrayal of the Wacky character Willy Wonka, however i found him hilariously funny and felt affection for the character of which he played. The fabulous special effects really add to the magical world of the Chocolate factory, and compared to the bleak dark opening scenes, the contrast really does draw you into the film. It is a great film all ages, however i would be apprehensive of taking any children below 8 or 9. My nieces are 6 and i felt that it maybe a little scary and weird in parts for them.<br/><br/>All in all a fabulous film!!!"
"spydermann_2099","9","1","4","1 August 2005"," Tim Burton Is The Candy Man!
","Living in Germany, I had to wait a couple weeks to see the movie . I had to know if it lived up to the hype. The answer... Yes! <br/><br/>I was blown away at how good this film was. I am a huge fan of the original musical with Gene Wilder and I never thought a better movie could be made. I was wrong. Wonka was far more eccentric and mysterious, Charlie was a far better character, and the songs were freaking hilarious. The Oompa Loompas stole the movie.<br/><br/>The flashbacks were cleverly done through he eyes of Wonka. The audience really got to see how Willie Wonka saw the world. I saw no Michael Jackson comparisons. More like Captain Kangaro, as Johnny Depp said he based the character from as stated in interviews. He was funny, over the top, and cruel in all the right ways.<br/><br/>The two places where the movie wained was with the character Veruca Salt. She wasn't as good as the girl in the original. Hr father, however, was spot on. Veruca did get hers in the end when she messed with the wrong squirrel.<br/><br/>The other oddity in the film was Grandpa Joe. I like the guy all through the movie until he started dancing for no reason. This happened twice and it was very awkward. It did not take away from the movie too much.<br/><br/>A few cool additions was seeing the naughty children leave the factory after they had violated the Wonka's wishes and the trek of Wonka in Loompa Land. Abosolutly phenomenal.<br/><br/>I recommend this movie to everyone. The humor is spot on. I especially enjoyed the story of Wonka in India building a chocolate palace for a Prince, only to discover it would soon melt in the hot sun. Awesome!<br/><br/>Hats off to Tim Burton for making a beautiful movie with a beautiful story. He has got to be one of the best directors ever!"
"riderpridethemovie","5","1","4","31 July 2005"," As twisted as licorice
","Sometimes directors are like kids in a candy store. They love the idea of playing with shiny toys so much they lose their heads. The only reason Martin Scorsese agreed to make The Aviator was so he could do the flying scenes and recreate the old Hollywood films he loves so much. Similarly, Tim Burton could not pass up the chance to create the most wonderful candy factory ever imagined. Just think of the wonderful CG effects and a budget he would have died for to make Edward Scissorhands! But when directors forget what made them famous, they fail. It's the story, stupids. And both films go down in flames (albeit spectacular flames), because the directors sacrifice the integrity of story for the glory of the image. Burton's mistake is an unfortunate attempt at remaking a movie that really didn't need remaking (a disturbing trend, after Planet of the Apes). In fact, I would argue making any studio movie out of a book that pretty clearly has a negative opinion of overconsumption is missing the point. There's a character named Mike Teevee for fudgemallow's sake. The only way to be faithful to Dahl's ideals would be to take authorship of the screenplay and not worry so much about being truthful to the book. The Charlie this film really needed was Kaufman. A book is a book, a screenplay is a screenplay and never the two should meet. For example, in a book it is perfectly fine to veer off into the stories of other characters because a reader is making a time investment significantly greater than two hours. But in a movie, the main character drives the movie. You can have one, two, five or 20 main characters, but they must all have their own story arcs and not be abandoned for large chunks of the movie. In this case, the movie is called Charlie & the Chocolate Factory, but poor Charlie ends up playing second (and often sixth) fiddle to Willie Wonka and his shenanigans. All the emotional momentum built up in the first act is let out in favour of CG trickery and a most-puzzling performance by Johnny Depp. By ignoring Charlie's plight and focusing on the back story of Wonka and the demise of each child, the scenes lack any emotional punch. What does Charlie feel about his fellow Golden Ticket winners? What does he think about Willie Wonka's behaviour? The book and the original honed in on the boy's relationship with his Grandpa Joe. In the remake, the pair are just along for the ride, to be drudged up conveniently in the third act. Now this might work if Charlie were replaced by another sympathetic character. But Depp's Wonka is just plain creepy. He seems to know the plight of each child, yet allows them to suffer, even taking pleasure in their pain. Father or no father, this is just demented. C&TCC is supposed to be a morality play for kids, not a horror show. What kind of message does a film send when such sadistic behaviour is justified on the grounds that the character didn't get candy as a kid? Many have compared Depp's portrayal as being Michael Jackson like. And for good reason. Wonka is a wild success at what he does, locks himself off in a palatial property, behaves like a child and ends up buying himself the family life he couldn't achieve. Now just imagine a film in which children are sent to Neverland with their parent's permission and come out emotionally scarred. Does that sound like a movie for kids?"

","At first, I was not very optimistic about Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, mostly because there was already the other, older adaptation of the book and people tend to have strong, I don't know, let's say loyalties, to ""originals."" Nevertheless, I saw Charlie and the Chocolate factory with a friend the day after my birthday. I smiled the entire time (I seriously don't think it's possible not to). The movie was perfect! It was charming and funny (in a dark way) and I loved it. Johnny Depp's Willy Wonka was childish and funny, and amazing to watch. I don't think you can compare this movie to the Gene Wilder version because they have very different feels to them. I personally like the new version better, especially Freddie Highmore as Charlie and David Kelly as Grandpa Joe, but to each his own, so don't be mad at me if you are in love with the old one."

Johnny Depp plays Willy Wonka brilliantly he is very unusual and scary looking but very good for the part. Freddie Highmore is the sweet Charlie Bucket and he is very normal and charming like Willy Wonka though sometimes you cant be sure whether Willy is being nice or nasty very funny dark and delightful. family fun. i recommend you see if you haven't already."

","Having read the book many times, I was excited to see that Burton was taking on an interpretation of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. He was the perfect director to give a movie the dark edge that was in the novel, yet keep some of the playful imagination that made it a kids' book.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, what I saw on screen was extremely disappointing. From the silence during the movie and the hushed whispers afterward, I wasn't alone.<br/><br/>The good things about this movie: the great glass elevator was used (and was wonderful). The nut room scene was amusing. And the chocolate river was perfect. But the rest of the factory and sets were just... eh.<br/><br/>Charlie was convincing as the good-natured boy who cared for his family, but the other children didn't make me believe their roles. Violet's mother seemed like she was still stuck playing her role in Galaxy Quest. And sadly, Depp's Wonka struck me as entirely too Michael Jackson-ish. So much so, that it instinctively forced me from wanting to enjoy the movie.<br/><br/>Quite, quite sad... because I love Burton's work and Depp's amazing acting skills. If they were going for disturbing shock value, I guess they succeeded. But I remember enjoying the book and the dreams and fantasy within the dark undertones... and that just wasn't here."
"elcopy","3","1","4","24 July 2005"," Why bother?
","Unnecessary, redundant, pointless. I don't know what's the deal with Hollywood, but remakes aren't cutting it. Burton already has the equally mediocre and equally pointless ""Planet of the Apes"" remake on his resume. This movie premieres in a summer where other 70s movies like ""The Bad News Bear"" ""The Amityville Horror"" and ""The Longest Yard"" are being brought back for no reason other than Hollywood seems to have run out of ideas.<br/><br/>Doesn't mean ""Charlie"" is a total disaster. It has many things that are possibly better than ""Willie"". But, if you have seen both, you can imagine anyone asking this question: ""Why bother?"". Honestly, I was bored in the middle of the movie. I didn't leave the theater because I try to watch a complete film no matter what, but nothing could fix the feeling.<br/><br/>I can tell Hollywood that I read, and there are plenty of good stories out there yet to be told. If they have the courage to go for the next original hit, instead of giving people the same old stuff because it is already proved successful, they'll see the audiences erode. I am one who has bowed not to see remakes anymore after the release of the (second!) remake of ""King Kong""."

(and meant to be) So many movies out now don't require any thinking - this actually made you look for all of the ""inside"" jokes - and the characters were so much better. The only part I really didn't like was the explanation of why Willy Wonka was so weird - let him just be weird without explaining it....that's the whole point.

","Charlie and the Chocolate Factory was my favorite childhood book and I loved the '71 version with Gene Wilder, so when I heard that they were remaking it with Johnny Depp, I thought it'll probably be very different and weird, but it was actually worse than I thought.<br/><br/>(sigh) Where do I begin? First I have to admit that this version is more true to the book, that however doesn't make it any better than the '71 version. First Johnny Depp as Wonka. Nothing like the eccentric, witty and clever Wonka Gene Wilder played. Instead they made him pale as a ghost, timid, frail and emotionally wounded. I don't know whose idea it was to dig into his sad childhood past, but it didn't make the plot more interesting, just well...sad. In the process Depp's Wonka wasn't funny, charming are even warm. He seemed to be afraid of the kids.<br/><br/>Gone are the one-liners, the philosophical quotes and the great original songs. Remember Pure Imagination? the Candyman? Veruca's song I Want it Now? All gone and replaced by the awful modernized tunes by the Oompa Loompas.<br/><br/>Now the Oompa Loompas. Where the '71 version had a cast of little people with green hair and orange faces singing catchy songs that tell the moral tales of the children, they have been replaced by a single person (Deep Roy) singing horrible songs that you can barely hear the lyrics to. Unlike the 'oompa, loompa, doopity do' chorus, I can't remember any of the songs because you'll want to forget them.<br/><br/>Other changes include Charlie having a father, which he did in the book, the effects were pretty good and the acting from the children good, but it lacks warmth and feeling. I felt that the actor who played Grandpa Joe was a bit too old and what about the whole 'I've got a golden ticket'? We don't get a sense of how badly Charlie wanted this because there was no anticipation for it. Also, they didn't get into the big worldwide search for the tickets, as in the '71 version'.<br/><br/>Overall, this was a big mess and not a good remake at all. I don't know why they felt the need to mess with a classic anyway.<br/><br/>Skip it and rent the original."

Whereas the original had wit, charm, and every frame was infused with magic, this version is stale, cold, and boring. Burton is a genius at art direction, but he should never be allowed to direct again. He has no sense of human interaction, storyline, editing, pacing, or direction whatsoever. The perfect example is the scene where Charlie finds the Golden Ticket. In the original, it still brings a tear to my eye when little Charlie Bucket finds it.

While the inside of the factory is filled with psychedelic colors. One of my favorite things were the Oompa-Loompas. The actor playing all of them was a really original idea. Even though at the end of the movie there is no hint that there is going to be a second, even though the book continues, maybe, Tim Burton as usual wants to put his own twist to the movie and the plot.

","There are very few truly delicious films in the world. I could only name perhaps one or two off of the top of my head. After watching this film, however, I added another title to my mental list. Maybe I'm biased, being a Depp/Burton/Elfman fan through and through (if they remade Piglet's BIG Adventure I'd watch it), but I adored the whole of it.<br/><br/>As we must, at some point, address the ever-present issue of 1971 version vs. modern, I'll get this over with as quickly as possible. Gene Wilder is a great actor. He's practically as much a magician with film as Wonka is with chocolate, and I adored his performance. His version is the one the whole family sits around to watch now and then, smiling happily at their antics. Then came Depp. One cannot compare Wilder to Depp-- apples and oranges, my friends. Where Gene's Wonka fills you with a sort of cotton candy feeling, Johnny reaches a little deeper into your gut to tickle some darker, less frequently-amused beast. He manages to convey childish glee one moment and, with a twirl of his cane and quirk of his lips, make some dark, sick part of you grin wickedly.<br/><br/>In this new version of the classic children's tale, we open with a sequence so purely Burton in its beauty that ""Edward Scissorhands"" flashbacks flow in unbidden. The golden tickets are placed delicately on the bars, accompanied (of course) by the haunting chords of Danny Elfman's musical genius. The vastness of the factory's strangeness is placed just below our noses. We know something odd is happening, but as yet we do not know what.<br/><br/>It is quickly established that Charlie Bucket is the character we will be following, and that you couldn't ask for a kinder, more pure-hearted boy. The child is a babysitter's dream: well-behaved, polite, loving, charming, and surrounded by a feeling of deep-down goodness. Poor, but hopeful; clever, but innocent.<br/><br/>We're taken on a quick recap of Grandpa Joe's years working under the legendary Willy Wonka, which contains a well-placed ""Scissorhands"" reference. Throughout this, not once do you see his face entirely unveiled, but his genius is evident. The factory opens, then closes.<br/><br/>""I am closing the factory forever. I'm sorry."" But, as Mrs. Bucket explains, forever can sometimes simply mean ""a very long time"". The factory reopens, the candy is pumped out by the pound, shops everywhere are filled once more with delectable sweets made by the now-legendary Willy Wonka himself. Despite this, no one has seen him in years. No one ever goes into the factory, and no one ever comes out.<br/><br/>When five golden tickets, each allowing the holder a tour of the chocolate factory, are announced to be hidden beneath the wrappers of five Wonka bars, madness breaks loose. Everyone wants one. During the pandemonium, our questionable quartet of horrendous children are introduced. We are quickly made to understand that whatever horrors await them, they're well-deserved.<br/><br/>Charlie finds the fifth golden ticket, and finally, the fun is ready to begin.<br/><br/>As the five lucky children and their chosen adult companions step through the gate, tension begins to build. They move slowly toward the doors, the doors open, there is an intake of breath in the seats around you, and... we begin to twitch convulsively at the unstoppable flow of It's a Small World memories.<br/><br/>The show quickly explodes before the five guests, breaking down rapidly into a mess of melting plastic eyeballs. You may want to cover the eyes of small children at this point. And then, finally, Wonka himself appears.<br/><br/>Within thirty seconds, we have the distinct impression he desperately wants to cut out the children's tongues. From there on in, there is a wild romp of crime and punishment. Wonka keeps up a quirky commentary throughout, even going so far as to give small, sadistic smiles whenever one of the nasty little beasts is swallowed by the factory. The new Oompa Loompas (there's been much talk about them, I know) are charming and witty, with rather somber faces (all the same one, actually).<br/><br/>In ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"", it was Charlie who learned a valuable life-lesson at the hands of Willy Wonka. In this newer rendition, Charlie must guide the eccentric man to realize the value of family.<br/><br/>I, for one, left the theater feeling fulfilled and warm, with the strangest craving for truffles."
"cajacobs38","10","1","4","21 July 2005"," Magical Chocolate Factory
","The movie is the perfect realization of the book. I loved the original version of this movie but anticipated the release of this one. I am happy that it is NOT A REMAKE of the original. The return of Charlie's father and the invention of the toothpaste cap sculpture I loved. Even the portrayal of Charlie's hovel of a house was amazing. The grandparents were great, particularly the moments of silence while Grandpa George is cursing while Charlie's mother holds his (and the audience's)ears. I was swept away in the fantasy of colors, special effects and another mind-bending performance by Johnny Depp. No one could have played Willie Wonka better. I am glad Gene Wilder changed his mind. I was reminded of William Shatner complaining about STAR TREK NEXT GENERATION and Mr. Shatner was also wrong. Will the Oscars wake up and finally give this incredibly talented man the nod?! I cannot stop telling people about the glass elevator, what a fantastic journey!!! Violet's mother was a bit creepy. Stepford mother in training, I think. The computer generation of the Oompa Loompas is wild. Freddie Highmore was enchanting, a number of moments when I heard sniffling and realized it was me. I caught myself making gleeful noises like a little kid and holding my breath in anticipation. I swear you could smell the chocolate, it was magical."
"TheMovieMark","6","1","4","21 July 2005"," Worth at least one look
","First off, let me just point out the following: 1. I have never read the book. 2. I have never watched Gene Wilder's Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory in its entirety.<br/><br/>If you're finished picking your bottom lip up off the ground then we can continue. Why does everybody act so shocked when I reveal I have never watched the original Willy Wonka from start to finish? People act like I've deliberately sinned in the literal presence of God when I tell them this, as if I've back-handed Him and boasted, ""There's more where that came from, old man."" Come on, people, don't look so shocked. The movie wasn't THAT big of a hit ($4 million at the box office). Granted, it's a popular kid's movie, but still. The good news is that I can offer you a completely unbiased opinion.<br/><br/>I have to admit that I wasn't exactly peeing my pants to see this movie. And if I *had* been peeing my pants just to see a movie then it would've probably been in my best interest to seek medical help. But the trailer gave me no desire to see it. The main problem in my mind was Willy Wonka just looked too goofy. The fact that he made me think of Michael Jackson didn't help. Despite the ruling of twelve jurors, I still wouldn't trust the guy to own a chocolate factory and invite kids to it. So admittedly, I went into the movie with the expectations of Tom Cruise at an amusement park with height restrictions - hope for the best but expect the worst.<br/><br/>""All right, Johnny, if you're done being cute can you please tell us if the movie far exceeded your expectations?"" Well, it's a'ight, but I'd say ""far exceeded"" is a bit much. Visually the movie looks great, the storytelling is smooth and presents an interesting morality tale, Freddie Highmore is quite good as Charlie Bucket (the only non-annoying kid in the movie), and the chocolate world looks realistic enough that I was seriously craving candy while watching it.<br/><br/>But on the flip side, the movie ran a little slow in parts, Willy Wonka had a tendency to be too weird for what seemed like the sake of just being weird, and I didn't care for the Oompa Loompas. After being told that the Oompa Loompas were creepy, I was quite disappointed. They're about as scary as being attacked by a bat-wielding midget in a gunfight. I know that probably doesn't make much sense to you, and I'm sure that may sound freaky, but if you've ever been in the situation then you'd really know. Oh you'd know.<br/><br/>It's a mildly entertaining flick, but I really have no need to see it again. It neither captivated me nor enraged me to such a degree that I feel compelled to convince you one way or another on whether you should see it.<br/><br/>I will point out that Stephanie and my cousin Nicholas are both fans of the original, and they both agree that it's better than this remake. Stephanie's main complaint was that all of the Oompa Loompa songs are different and nowhere near as good as the originals. They definitely tried to jazz things up a bit, but I found it annoying that some of the lyrics are hard to understand. When you're singing lyrics about why each of the kids is bad then that's part of the storytelling, and I shouldn't be forced to strain my ears to hear.<br/><br/>But what I really want to know is why people think Johnny Depp running into glass and falling down is so funny? It happens twice and the audience howled with laughter each time while I sat there stone-faced. I can only imagine how hard everybody would've laughed if Willy Wonka had farted and fell down at the same time.<br/><br/>THE GIST: <br/><br/>Go with your instinct. Are you dying to see it? Well, if you're actually dying to see this movie then you should probably go see a doctor. No movie should bring near death upon anybody. But once you find some treatment then it's probably worth it to you to check out. I know the people at the screening I attended loved it. So be it. But if the trailer does nothing to intrigue you, and if you didn't even like the original, then save your money. This is one of those movies I'd personally wait to make a rental or catch on TV."
"Lindsey-Osterman","10","1","4","21 July 2005"," Surprised and delighted.
","As some of the others who have commented here, I went to the theater curious, but not expecting much, mostly due to the trailers. But the movie was surprisingly great for several reasons.<br/><br/>Primarily, Tim Burton managed to make this movie a completely unique entity, so that fans of the first version shouldn't have any problem enjoying this version. There are major plot changes (I haven't read the book, so I don't know if the changes make this movie truer or more distinct from it) that make the entire essence of the movie different from the original. I still love the Gene Wilder version, and I love this one equally. They are different enough to be non-comparable. I think this is extremely good work on Burton's part.<br/><br/>Other than this, it was a simply entertaining and intriguing film. Depp's trademark use of subtle facial expressions was used fully here, adding perhaps even more depth to Wonka's character than the flashbacks into his childhood. There is a creepiness that underlies the entire plot, but because of Burton's surreal touch, I disagree with the rumor that was floating around pre-release that it is too scary for kids. In some ways, the original was actually darker because it was going more for realism.<br/><br/>To sum up, it's a movie I would highly recommend. Burton does his reputation justice."
"dunlapcu","10","1","4","21 July 2005"," Excellent!
","I really couldn't believe that anyone could top Gene Wilder's performance as Willie Wonka, but I should have known better! Knowing that Johnny Depp would bring him to life, and Tim Burton directing, should have given me a clue that it would be nothing less than fantastic!! They exceeded my expectations and turned Willie Wonka into the person I had imagined him to be when I read the book as a child. All the cast was wonderful, and the set was outstanding! There was also a magnetism that could be felt between Charlie and Willie - something I think was lacking in the first movie. This is a must see for any age - as it will leave you with a smile."
"tcote","10","1","4","21 July 2005"," Splendid movie
","I guess I should preface this comment with the fact that I am one of Depp's biggest fans and therefore already biased. I am also a huge fan of the original Gene Wilder movie. I did not listen to or hear any reviews prior to seeing the film (I rarely do with any film), however, knowing that Tim Burton had directed it already gave me an advantage. Any true film-lover would understand that Burton's style is anything if it isn't dark. After all, this is the same brilliant mind that brought us 'Sleepy Hollow' and 'Planet of the Apes', neither of which I would consider kid-friendly.<br/><br/>The film closely depicted the book by Roald Dahl, so anyone who has read this will have a great idea of what to expect. If you are going to the movie with the expectation of seeing a remake of Mel Stuart's original, keep your money because it won't happen.<br/><br/>As for bringing the children along, I would say yes, they would enjoy it, if for no other reason, than to take in the amazing cinematography and art direction. The colors are fantastic and would be most appreciated by a younger audience. I would just expect a few questions along the way...some whose answers may not be within their grasp yet.<br/><br/>As for myself, I look forward to proudly displaying the DVD on my shelf right next to the original."
"gimmeDV","4","1","4","21 July 2005"," Hollywood-isation at work...
","I went into this movie ready to enjoy a really good movie going experience, as I know the director Tim Burton could put so much into this film and make more than just an ""Entertaining"" film. But, I walked out of the theater thinking that Burton's voice may have been stifled by the producers of the movie. There were parts of the movie where we started to get some character development but, I felt that all the characters, including Willy Wonka & Charlie Bucket, came out very flat. The story seemed very formulatic and a little TOO simplistic for my tastes, knowing that a big director like Tim Burton was involved. ANYONE could have done this movie the way that Burton did.<br/><br/>Yes, Yes, Yes... I know that at it's core, this film is supposed to be a children's movie but, it dangles somewhere in-between light & fun, & mysterious and dark... and finding it's tone was very difficult to do. <br/><br/>If anything, I at least enjoyed the title sequence along with Danny Elfman's inventive opening theme.... however, after that... I found that the songs win which the Oompa-Loompa's were showcased were inaudible, distasteful, & just embarrassing to watch.<br/><br/>To sum it all up... this was a prime example of today's Hollywood. Another movie which could have been so much more, and I think ultimately wanted to be so much more... but ultimately missed it's mark."
"disneychick10891-1","10","1","4","20 July 2005"," Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is much better than Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory IMO
","I think that this version is a lot better than the old one. ( That's just my opinion) Tim Burton is one of my favorite directors and definitely did an awesome job on this film!! I think the other film is sort of dark and creepy, but this one is only a tad dark. This one doesn't have any crummy songs like ""Pure Imagination"" or ""I got a golden ticket"" or that depressing song ""Cheer up Charlie"" And I absolutely love the oompa loompas and their songs!! If you've seen this... YEAY!! If you haven't seen it... GO AND SEE IT!! ( you don't have to if you don't want to)<br/><br/>Remember- all of this is my opinion. You can disagree or agree, I don't care lol."
"TheDuke-2","5","1","4","20 July 2005"," Not as good as original...
","Let me say first that I'm spoiled to have had the pleasure of watching the original with Gene Wilder (who was hands down better then Depp...sorry Burton fans) This movie is indeed a good children's movie and one I would recommend you take your kids to. However for the fans of the original, you will be very disappointed, unless of course you are one of the ""Burton Coolaid drinkers"" The visuals are wonderful in the movie as is the musical score by the always great Danny Elfman, but the two things that made the original fun and a classic was Gene Wilder and the Ompa Loopas with their respective musical numbers. The songs are what made the magic happen for me and that was very much missing from this version. Depp's performance as Wonka was cold and off track the entire movie which for me ruined the picture.<br/><br/>Gene Wilder's charming and eccentric performance could have only been equaled today by the likes of Robin Williams, Steve Martin, or Jim Carrey. Depp is by all accounts a great actor and I enjoy him in almost everything he does, except here."
"j7w39","9","1","4","20 July 2005"," Good twist
","Thie is a very good movie because there are many things that have been changed from the original. The original was made to not conform with the times, so to make the remake the same would just not be right. Tim Burton has done a great job of putting a twist on this movie that adds to the old story while still keeping many thing fresh and new. Johnny Depp is no Gene Wilder, but he is the closest that there is and he does a great job. And one last kudos goes to Deep Roy, who is plainly hilarious. This is definitely a movie to go see, I think that it will, in coming years, be a classic. Just like its predecessor. Go see this movie, I'm sure you love it."
"Xizor159","10","1","4","20 July 2005"," Spectacular Movie
","I was absolutely stunned when I saw this movie. I expected it to be a silly, childish movie, but (though it was silly and childish), I thought it was very well done. The music was awesome, I loved the way the factory was laid out, and it really just kept me laughing. I highly suggest that you go and see this movie.<br/><br/>Another funny little thing that made me laugh was that the oompa loompas were all played by one man. It must have been hard, especially, to do the scene in the nut room around the garbage chute. It was still very funny. When they were winding in the tunnels though (on the boat), I wish they had made it a little more like the original, cause that was funny. But this was still really good. There was no Mr. Slugworth in this one either, and the everlasting gobstoppers really weren't all that important. Whether or not this was what went on in the book, I don't know, but still, it was better that way. <br/><br/>Wonka also had a lot of ""flashbacks"" in this movie to explain why he's a reclusive Chocolateer. Wasn't in the book, but still added a very nice touch to the movie. Quite a bit of the humor was found there, in the flashbacks. <br/><br/>Anyhow, I really hope you guys go and see this movie cause it was really spectacular!"
"religionrem","10","1","4","20 July 2005"," bad re-make or bad adaptation?
","Is this the way that everyone is going to react when a second movie adaptation is made decades after the first adaptation was released? Are you going to compare everything to it's predecessor? When a director uses a classic story and creates their own version on the screen they don't want you to come into the movie with preconceived notions. Don't compare their work to someone else's.<br/><br/>This movie is not a ""re-make"", it's an ""adaptation"". If you don't like it because you don't think it holds true to the original story, then fine, so be it. But if you dislike this movie because you think it's too different from the '71 version then you shouldn't be allowed to see more than one movie if it's based on a book.<br/><br/>I hate to see what you people will say once King Kong is released- ""Oh, Naomi Watts doesn't capture the essence of Ann Darrow's terror like Fay Wrey did."""
"bwolper","4","1","4","19 July 2005"," You Have Got To Be Kidding!
","The kids were great! The scenery was wonderful. Johnny Depp?? Are you kidding? Depp's interpretation of Willie Wonka is off-kilter at best. This presentation of a psychologically unbalanced pitiful man that had lost his childhood left a real cynical taste in the mouth of the viewer. This man is no Pide Piper. It makes you wonder why any child would want to meet him and tour his factory.<br/><br/>Roy Deep was a super choice to portray the Oompa-Loompahs. His facial expressions conveyed more than any dialog could.<br/><br/>All in all, instead of being any kind of a feel-good movie, this one left a negative feeling."
"shemyrushmoremax","10","1","4","19 July 2005"," Willy Wonka here he is
","I was told last minute by my friend that he was taking me to the midnight premiere of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory on Thursday night. Antici..............pation was in the air as we drove to the theatre in my friends car which was jam packed with my friend, Tim, and our other friend Shane and this girl that Tim had introduced me to, Alyssa. We got to the theatre six hours early expecting a mile long line, but found only a miniscule six people. Tim and Shane left leaving Alyssa and I to know each other. We both became very fond of each other, and started chattin' it up. It didn't take long to get into the theatre, and it was only a matter of time before the people came it. It was slow at first. Everybody came to know each other as friends, for example Alyssa and I chatted to the couple in front of us, and found out about their jobs which was interesting, the woman's was as the one hour photo developer and said that One Hour Photo tried to make it more epic than it was. The other tested video games for a living. It was a party atmosphere for a good five hours, and then when the projector flipped on, the five hundred seated theatre lit up with joy. I don't want to give away anything from the movie, but I will say this, the oompa loompas were astounding. They're songs had the lovable Danny Elfman fun to them, but Elfman had reinvented himself on this film dealing with new sounds of the modern world of music. Tim Burton's vision on this project was visually stunning, the moment you see the chocolate factory's inside, your jaw drops in amazement. The vast field of candy makes your mouth water, while your eyes beg for more. Then, the film has more of a back story which is fantastic. It is hard to keep all of the film in without spilling any of its secrets. But, it is definitely one of the best, if not the best movie of this year. So, get off your computer seat staring into the digital screen, and scrape up nine dollars, and go see this movie."

When people ask me if this was better than the original, my reply is, ""They are totally different movies and comparing them isn't fair"". I loved this one and I will continue to love the version with Gene Wilder. The addition of Dr. Wilbur Wonka was wonderful and gave the way Depp portrayed Willy Wonka a depth that was touching. Of course we already know that each ""bad"" child meets an end that mirrors their personality. This stays the same in Burton's vision with the exception of Veruca whose demise stays true to Dahl's work. The score for this movie is more upbeat and I think Elfman did a fantastic job with the Oompa songs (which have lines directly from the book.) I highly recommend the soundtrack, book and movie."

The movie appeals to all age groups, which makes this a good film to take anyone to who enjoys movies. The score for this movie really sets the tone and makes you want to get up on your feet and start cheering. Johnny Depp's performance as Willy Wonka is close to perfection with only a few minor flaws here and there, nothing that serious. As for the Oompa Loompas, I can't imagine a better person to portray the little helpers other than Deep Roy. This movie really brings out the inner child in you and puts a smile on your face.

I thought that all of the actors did an amazing job with their parts and the grandparents practically stole the show for me. Freddie Highmore was very pleasant to see as Charlie. My theatre II class did this as a children's play this year so a lot of the lines were exactly the same because the play was also based more on the book and this made me want to see the movie even more. I have to say that even if you loved the original you should at least go into this remake with an open mind.

Unfortunately it was a huge disappointment. Mostly it just dragged and dragged along. There were rare moments of amusement, but more moments of ""uggh, this is stupid!"" The only reason I'm not giving it fewer points is that there were some cool-looking scenes. Willy Wonka was portrayed as creepy-in-the-Michael Jackson-sort-of-way. He wasn't a pedophile or anything (in fact he seemed to hate kids), but he still made you feel squeamy in the same kind of way. If you don't believe me and still want to see it, please take a kid with you. Do not, by any means, make another adult such as your boyfriend (so sorry, Jay!) sit through this crappy movie with you. It's extremely juvenile. It's not even worth waiting for the DVD. I wish I could have gotten my money back. It was awful."

","I have to say, when I went to see this movie, I didn't expect it to be that great. After seeing the first teasers & trailers, I found it bad in poor taste. The last trailer I saw seemed a little different. While watching the movie you will find Johnny Depp (as usual) gets in on his role. The setting of this movie is strange. I like how they kept to the book, but they placed a modern edge on this. Giving the feeling of back then, but adding modern day items without over doing them. There is a few scenes that would give an adult viewer a different message with humor, but to a child this may not be understood! I would recommend this for all ages, but younger children may need some guidance."

Johnny Depp, once again, was brilliant and Tim Burton did an amazing job at sprucing up an already fantastic classic. I found this movie to follow the original book more than the previous movie made in 1971. This movie has the ability to make you laugh and also to make you realize how important certain things in life are.In the case of Charlie, how important it is to have a strong sense of self, and a love for family.

This one is much less sinister in its undertones, and contains much more emphasis on the value of family, which I really appreciated.<br/><br/>The movie is silly, ridiculous, almost unbelievable--but Burton makes it something you *want* to believe. He also sticks extremely close to the original book--the Oompa Loompa songs are taken almost directly from Roald Dahl's words. This movie made me laugh and laugh and feel like a kid again--the whole magical Wonka world really comes alive.<br/><br/>The ending dragged on a *bit* too long--and the added bits with Christopher Lee were a little unnecessary.

Though not all of the movies are a hit his performance always makes it worth it.<br/><br/>Upon watching ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" I again was shocked. His mannerisms as Willy Wonka are tremendous. From even the smallest twitch I was laughing. The long far off gazes gave his character the depth that it deserved. True, he did in a way ""steal the show"". Yet, at the same time, it showed why the connection of him and Charlie was there.<br/><br/>One of my favorite scenes from ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"" was not in this movie (the psycho boat seen). Yet, I didn't care, because I knew going in that this movie was going to be different and new with just the same characters that I new and loved. I loved the puns and comedic entries. The factory was brilliantly illustrated, showing the many magical rooms and routes gives the notice that anything is possible.<br/><br/>I feel that adults, as I am 25, and children alike will love this move. Of coarse as long as they don't go in thinking this is a remake of some movie and compare it the whole time. You have to go in to the movie and realize it is Different upon sitting in your seat at the theatre and be aware that it is a new movie of which you have never seen before.<br/><br/>As with any movie what do you learn from the story....Well in this you learn that: Anything is possible if you put your mind to it, Family is so important, and to believe in yourself.<br/><br/>I really think everyone should see this movie."

He is a snarky, baby faced manchild whose face was (I've read was modeled on Anna Wintour the Editor of Vogue and a real witch herself). He sounds like Michael Jackson meets the Church Lady with off-the-wall references to the 60s and 70s that will amuse parents and grandparents, but the best part is the kids - who are nasty, unlikeable, spoiled brats taken from Roald Dahl's book and brought up to date (never having read the book, I'm assuming some of the references are more 21st Century), and how he puts them down without being at all likable himself - making the movie even more sardonic and edgy. Freddie Highmore is a delight as he was in Neverland, but JD deserves an AC nom for his turn in this immensely savagely enjoyable black comedy. GO SEE IT - no matter your age - if you like pithy humor and political incorrectness you'll love this movie!!

He turned the character with the least amount of personality (in the original) to the having the most personality. The songs by the Oompa-Loompas are funny and cool. Oh, and it also tells how Willy Wonka got the Oompa-Loompas and why they work for him. The way the kids lose are funnier in this version. Like When Mike TV gets shrunk the Oompa-Loompas are in the t.v. with him (not shrunk) like a real t.v. and one of them smashes Mike with a pile of papers and Willy pulls him out and says thank heavens. he's completely unharmed and the father freaks out."

","Despite how much of a classic Willy Wonka And the Chocolate Factory is, Tim Burton achieves the impossible; Charlie and The Chocolate Factory matches, and some might say exceed, the legendary standards of the Gene Wilder classic.<br/><br/>Charlie has some dark moments. This is definitely not a film for children under six. However, despite being labled ""darker than the first,"" in many ways it is just the same. The opening credit scene, the attack of the squirrels...Fine. Its darker humor. But nothing in it is quite as scary as the tunnel scene in the original. However, Charlie does achieve a lot more with its slightly more adult turn.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp is certainly a lot easier on the eyes than Gene Widler. There is no way to say who's take on the eccentric Willy Wonka is better, though; despite differences, the character ends up being the spotlight of the movie. Of course.<br/><br/>Tim Burton took a lot of risks with this picture (Especially with the whole ""father is a dentist"" thing.), yet somehow they add to the fun of it. Sure, there are a few flaws: The opening credit sequence was a bit, well, creepy (Very creepy), the accidental pedophilic sayings (The worst? ""Eat my grass. Its delicous"" says Wonka to Mike. -shivers-),and the terrible wig Johnny had to wear. In contrast, the Oompa Loompa songs are actually hilariously funny-one's disco, another's hippie, and one's even rock! Also, despite not having musical pieces here and there, Danny Elfman's score fits the film.<br/><br/>At the end of the movie, the audience clapped. I clapped, too.<br/><br/>In other words, I'm so seeing this again."
"EvelynnTremble","7","1","4","18 July 2005"," Ever been on a tour that went too fast?
","That's what Charlie and the Chocolate Factory felt like to me. In the end I was left wondering where all the time went. I mean, the movie itself was long enough, so why did everything seem so rushed? In a flash the children had the tickets and were standing at the gates, and my girlfriend pointed out that everyone already knew this part of the story and maybe they wanted to focus on the factory. But even then, the factory never really got too much focus. The 71 movie had deeper character development of the children (I mean, with the exception of Mike Teevee, these kids weren't nearly as bad as the other ones) and the search for the golden tickets (the computer that refuses to reveal where the golden ticket is), as well as an insane amount of not always good musical numbers, and yet this movie was longer and had none of that. And what with the way Burton does visuals and the quick arrival to the factory, I thought for sure there would be tons more of the cool candy quirks from the book. And I'm not sure if there was a problem in the editing or what, but scenes that could have been more in depth by just having the scene run a few seconds longer were done so quickly that it was hard for me to sympathize or associate with the characters.<br/><br/>I've read the book and I've seen the 71 movie, and I understand that Dahl didn't care for Wilder's portrayal of Wonka, and that he disliked Willie Wonka and the Chocolate Factory and that's OK. A lot of authors are disappointed by films adapted from their books, it happens, despite the fact that the film might be enjoyable but not true to the storyline. And while Burton's film is slightly truer than the 71, it still veers off on its own subplots that are not included in the book. I wouldn't have minded so much if it wasn't for the fact that every fifteen minutes the continuity of the film was interrupted by incredibly cheesy flashbacks. Couldn't they have come up with some other way to incorporate a back story for the chocolate genius? What was more unsettling than the flashbacks were the unnecessary narrations that did not contribute to the story.<br/><br/>The visuals were great, of course, and this is an era where the chocolate factory's elements, including the Great Glass Elevator, could be brought to life the way they deserved to be done. However, the gizmos and gadgets in this film were not, in my opinion, as creative and wild as the 71 movie, and seemed more coldly efficient.<br/><br/>I did love the parts of this film that did represent the book, the stories Grandpa Jo tells, the acquiring of the Oompa Loompas, and even the boat looks right finally. Also I love that we do get to see the end result of the children. Depp's Wonka was OK, he's done better in roles. He was hilarious, but he seemed a lot less excited than the Wonka in the book. Too childish. Wilder's Wonka was great, but he wasn't like the book Wonka either. No one's got that right yet.<br/><br/>This movie wasn't bad, it was pretty good, but I think the point is that it could have been a little better if the script had slowed down a little and developed each scene, instead of having to rely on several flashbacks. Not bad, but not great. So is life."
"slkendall","6","1","4","17 July 2005"," It's O.K. ---Only some info is spoiled...not a lot
","Although I do believe Depp is one of the best actors (i.e. Neverland, Pirates of the Caribbean, etc) and was made to fit this mold, I didn't not believe that the character fit Depp in the end. Depp is a strong character with a strong personality and although this ideal of Wonka is also strong, Depp to me sounding like he's high most of the time, doesn't really get me into the mood to watch this movie.<br/><br/>Secondly, I do feel that they should have changed critical parts of the story: i.e. Charlie having a father, Charlie and Grandma Joe making the mistake, the glass elevator announced earlier...etc.<br/><br/>However, I do believe the the new movie was right to have changed the name to Charlie and the Chocolate Factory instead of Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory since in the end it's a completely different movie.<br/><br/>It isn't a movie for kids since there are lot of adult jokes and the character's are a little mature from the original, but for the mature movie goer's it may be a different movie, but it's something worth seeing."

","My four year old and I anxiously rolled into the theater to view the latest version of the classic, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. Tim Burton did not let us down in the vivid imagery department, and Danny Elfman delivers yet another awesome soundtrack. While I can live with Johny Depp's Michael Jackson meets Marilyn Manson adaptation of Willy Wonka, the story seems to drag...a lot. The story is generally what you would expect if you have read the book or seen the Gene Wylder version, but it seems to lag. I don't want to give away anything, but expect some good one-liners and a few decent jokes, but there is plenty of down time between them. Maybe next summer we'll get a prequel, ""Wonka Begins""."
"jameslatson","4","1","4","17 July 2005"," Huge Disappointment, remake or not
","Even though I loved the original, I still really wanted to give this a chance to stand on its own. I know that people sometimes have very high expectations for remakes, so I tried very hard to watch it independent of any preconceptions.<br/><br/>They made it pretty hard.<br/><br/>Remember that the original film was the FILMMAKER'S interpretation of the book. You see some of that in this new version, but you also see a lot of direct emulation of the PREVIOUS FILMMAKER'S INTERPRETATION. In other words, a lot of gratuitous copying from the original film. They just can't make up their mind if they want to be original or if they want to tweak the classic. So it's a little of both. Never mind the ""sweeping"" story changes like switching the parental escorts of two of the kids (the mother for the father and vice versa) which was different from the original film.<br/><br/>My number one complaint is the casting of Johnny Depp. And I really like him as an actor--usually, he's terrific. I don't know what happened here. He appeared to be an effeminate Raggedy Andy with issues. (Almost a walk through job, although perhaps this is as much to do with the directing.) Even if I had never seen the original film until now, had I seen both back to back in an afternoon, it would be impossible not to pick Gene Wilder as the standout actor. And for that matter, the original film.<br/><br/>This one was just a bit too produced, too forced, and there was too much ""posing."" Everything films today seem to de-spire to.<br/><br/>I know this is a Tim Burton film, and ""odd is in."" (I also liked some of Burton's previous films, so I wasn't negatively biased in my expectations.) The visuals were interesting, and some quite nice, but a lot of the computer animation seemed just that...oddly animated. Take for instance the kid who's stretched flat, as he walks out of the factory. The not-quite fluidness...the odd physics...the animation doesn't work in places. It ends up Saturday cartoon-ish.<br/><br/>I will say this...young children are bound to like this movie, because they won't pick up on the subtleties and things that don't mesh. The movement, the sound, the color--it should serve well as an electronic babysitter when you're trying to keep the kids occupied in front of the TV after the DVD is released. Still, not as good as the original version, though.<br/><br/>In the end: if there's one thing that filmmakers need to learn, it's that you can't go back to Oz."
"derekjager","3","1","4","17 July 2005"," Bad Script, Poor Set Design, Any Director Would Do
","Pretty lame script and Depp kept taking me ""out"" of the picture because he was so...so...Johnny Depp weird! <br/><br/>And the set design inside the factory was just awful -- very much ""Wizard of Oz"" sound-stage -- and that was 70 years ago! Poor lighting, too. <br/><br/>And I think ANY director could have put this picture through its pacings -- even the audience (in NYC) was restless. You could tell we all wanted to enjoy ourselves, but it just went on and on and on, one poorly stages scene after the other. <br/><br/>And the word play and jokes? Fell on dead ears, as the saying goes. <br/><br/>With all the talent, and the wonderful story, this one really missed it."
"darryl-49","10","1","4","17 July 2005"," Fantastic and endearing, while slightly creepy
","I am not a huge fan of the 1971 Willy Wonka movie, but found it entertaining, especially Gene Wilder's wildly mood-swinging portrayal of Wonka. His understated delivery of ""No, stop, don't"" has even found its way into my own lexicon.<br/><br/>So, when my teen daughter and I saw the trailer for Burton's Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, we both had the same response... Johnny Depp looks sooooo..... WEIRD!!!!!! We agreed we HAD to see it just to see Depp's performance. I was prepared for the possibility of disaster.<br/><br/>We saw it opening day, at the earliest matinÃ©e. I was impressed throughout, and laughed out loud at numerous times. The audience was mostly Moms with elementary aged children, so my mid-teen daughter may have felt a little out of place being there with her dad. But we both loved it! Interestingly, during some of the scenes where I was laughing, she would look at me and say, ""What are you laughing at? That's SCARY!!!!!!"" Which of course made me laugh more.<br/><br/>Forget all the talk about Depp channeling Michael Jackson. Maybe people have Jackson on the brain because he was recently in the news. I was aware of the Jackson comparisons before seeing the movie, and it was not at all a distraction. Depp was Willy Wonka. Not Michael Jackson, not Michael Jackson-as-Willy Wonka.<br/><br/>Go see this movie, and take your kids. Burton has made a movie thoroughly entertaining for all ages."
"frank-547","5","1","4","17 July 2005"," New Wonka not worth watching
","Watching Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is like eating a sugar-free chocolate bar: It looks delicious, but it leaves a funny aftertaste, and the overall experience is unsatisfying.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp's low-key, effeminate portrayal of Willy Wonka is the worst and cannot even be compared to the Gene Wilder's brilliant performance in the 1971 classic Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory. Depp is a good actor, but Wilder was a comic genius. Wilder's Wonka was a manic, frenetic, menacing, scrumpdiddleumptious delight. Depp's creation is just sad and creepy.<br/><br/>Naturally, the whole film is done in Tim Burton's dark/gloomy/Gothic style. Sure, the effects are better than the 1971 film, but the magic that thrilled kids of my generation is disappointingly missing in the new film.<br/><br/>The regally lovely Helena Bonham Carter is wasted as Charlie's mother. Burton decided to make her look gruesomely dowdy and her make-up includes gray and gunky teeth. In fact, everyone's teeth looked nasty in the movie, and looking up at them on a giant screen was making me sick. What's up with the close-ups on the ugly choppers, Tim? Jeez! Danny Elfman's score was predictably good, and his attempt to update and out-do the Oompa Loompa song and dance routines was the best part of the movie.<br/><br/>I still have vivid memories of the fantastic performances turned in by the child actors from the 1971 film. Veruca Salt screaming, I want it NOW!"" Mike Teevee's shrunken voice saying, ""Am I coming in clear?"" Violet Beauregarde's gum-snapping, snappy comments. Those kids embodied the bad habits their character's represented. The kids in this new batch don't even come close."

","This movie seems to veer from being sweet and old-fashioned to modern and mean-spirited, with periods of being thoroughly creepy as well. I would not have thought that I could be more disturbed by this second film adaptation than I was by the first, given that I was approximately four years old when I saw the first _Charlie and the Chocolate Factory_. However, I found this new version to be very disturbing at times.<br/><br/>The four stars that I have given it are primarily for the first third of the movie. There are some very funny moments, an excellent cast, and a certain style that I have to admire. However, I wouldn't recommend this movie, and would suggest that parents of very young children not take the little ones to see it."
"bbSouthstreet","10","1","4","15 July 2005"," What is the opposite of amazing?
","Whatever it is, it is definitely not the description for this charming, amazing and spellbinding take of the classic story directed by the brilliant mind of Tim Burton. After reading the whimsical book by famed children's author Roald Dahl and watching the Gene Wilder film, I just felt that the film was missing an important element that the book had. But in this film Burton catches that element and milks it for all it's worth. The factory is not the land of OZ as it was depicted in the Gene Wilder version, the Oompa Loompas are not happy go lucky leprechauns and Mr. Willy Wonka is not Mr. Rogers, he is, if I dare say it, a brilliant mix of J.D. Salinger's anger towards society and Howard Hughe's longing for a sanctuary. Once again, Johnny Depp takes us for a wild thrill ride as he did in Pirates of the Caribbean. Freddie Highmore sprinkles some his dramatic charm as the impoverished Charlie Bucket. Danny Elfman sends chills up the audiences' spines with his forebodingly poetic and eerily delightful score and Tim Burton strikes out with his imaginative design and brilliantly dark direction. This film is one of 2005's best so far and I hope it is up for an Oscar."
"mccoyshelley","9","1","4","15 July 2005"," Great version of story
","I liked everything about the movie except that the Oompa Loompa singing was somewhat annoying. It was so high-pitched it was hard to understand the lyrics, although the parts I COULD understand were very clever.<br/><br/>The Depp/Burton version is more reflective of the dark humor characteristic of Dahl's writing.<br/><br/>The references I've seen to Michael Jackson are simply reflections of our time. Willy Wonka was actually the opposite of a pedophile, if you examine him more closely you'll see that he didn't really care too much for children. That's part of the irony of it being a ""children's story."""

","I have been anticipating the release of this movie since I first heard about it, over a year ago, both being a huge fan of Tim Burton, and the amazing Mr. Depp. I had counted down the months, weeks, days, and then hours till I got to see it, pumping myself up in the extreme, and I have NOT been disappointed!! Tim Burton's ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" is easily one of the best films I've ever seen.It was humorous, touching, and of course, as with many Burton films, very strange at parts. <br/><br/>The Oompa-loompas were all played by one man, the same who played Mr. Soggybottom in Big Fish. These Loompas have the singing roles after each child's disappearance, just like in the 70's version, but this time they use the lyrics that were in the book. Danny Elfman provides all the voice talent, and is amazing as usual.<br/><br/>The kids are also excellent portrayals of the children described in the book. Each child nailed his or her part perfectly. Of course, Freddie Highmore as Charlie is particularly delightful, since he's so adorable and charming. I especially liked Violet Beauregarde's portrayal, it seemed so dead on as what I envisioned in the book when I read it when I was younger.<br/><br/>Another amazing aspect of this movie was the humour. 50%of the time, I was in stitches from laughing so hard. This is by far the funniest Tim Burton film EVER. This version of ""Charlie..."" is 100 times funnier than the 70's version. And almost all the humour is family-friendly.<br/><br/>The visuals were stunning, it's a real treat for the eyes. So much colour! Everything was really surreal looking, it was beautiful. I loved the camera angles. Also, the Bucket's house is pretty interesting, still can't figure how it was standing.<br/><br/>And I can't finish this comment without commending the AMAZING performance by Johnny Depp as Willy Wonka. He played such an eccentric, immature, and sometimes distant version of the chocolatier, quite different from that of Gene Wilder's Wonka in the original. I think it was a really great thing that he didn't try to play the character the same way, because Wilder's portrayal would have been VERY hard to match.<br/><br/>Anyway, yes, I must stop rambling, just SEE THE MOVIE!! You will NOT regret it!!"

I mean for those that are questioning about the 1970's version, this explains it all, why is he like that, where does the Oompa Loompas come from and why, etc. The songs were very cheerful, specially the first song ""Willy Wonka"" and its a very touching movie. I think choosing Johnny Depp as the Willy Wonka was an awesome idea because that's how Willy Wonka is suppose to be, full of secrets, not so nice, and weird. So I recommend everybody to see this movie, even if you think its not going to be good, you'll totally change your mind. I think personally it is SO freaking much better than the 1970's version.

My 8 year old and I saw it today and thought that it was different enough from the original that they can compliment each other well, but be judged on their own merit. The characters were true to the original for the most part, with a few small changes. The situations were a little different, some were a little funnier I thought. Willie Wonka revealed a little more of himself in this movie. The oompah loompahs are funkier and we find out more about where they originated. They all are identical this time, but they weren't in the first one, I don't think. Check the credits this time- I think there was only one! Aren't computer graphics wonderful?!!

","I really enjoyed the first Willy Wonka as a child. As an adult, I truly liked the different 'take' on Willy Wonka that Tim Burton chose. I thought the flashbacks that Willy had concerning his childhood made the story seem more real. I not only felt sympathy for Willy, but it was interesting to note why he was so 'bizarre' with his guests...In the original, you did not know about the background of W.W. Why did he choose to be a candy maker, etc. No, it's not like the first movie and for those who want it to be, may be disappointed with this version as the movie focuses more on Willy Wonka then on Charlie and his family. Johnny Depp gives us a fresh perspective on the W.W. character albeit a much different one that the great Gene Wilder gave us in the original."

Although this one did add in a back-story for Willy Wonka, that was one of very few differences from book to movie. I thoroughly enjoyed the movie, and I don't see why anyone would prefer the old one. Do people simply believe it's more honorable to prefer the old to new? I just don't see the sense in it.

"Chrysanthepop","Null","1","5","4 October 2010"," Roald Dahl & Tim Burton = Awesomeness
","One of my favourite directors, Tim Burton, adapts a story that was written by one of my favourite writers, Roald Dahl. Thus, I was expecting nothing short of great. It's been ages since I last saw Mel Stuart's 'Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory' and I don't remember much but even though I disliked<br/><br/>Burton's more recent 'Alice in Wonderland', I thoroughly enjoyed 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory'. The movie is best enjoyed with the family and I must say that one should have some chocolates nearby when watching it because this film induced some strong cravings. Thankg goodness there was some chocolate cake.<br/><br/>Tim Burton once again creates a unique world and his use of colour reminded me of 'Edward Scissorhands' where the interiors of Edward's house was dark while the neighborhood was filled with colourful houses. Here Willy Wonka's factory is full of colour but the neighborhood outside has a gloomy look. It works because it reflects the impoverished family life of Charlie that is lit with his family's optimism and it also accents the greed and hypocrisy among the rich. Burton does a delightful job in representing Dahl's story. 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory' is full of imagination. The art direction is stunning<br/><br/>and the special effects department have done a first rate job. The songs were also wonderfully adapted and visualized. Even though they sound rather modern, it doesn't feel out of place. Cinematography is excellent and editing is brilliant. <br/><br/>Ideally a children's film, adults can enjoy it just as much, as I did with my family. In a way 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory' awakens the child inside us and gives the viewer an opportunity to walk down memory lane. August has written a splendid screenplay. There are plenty of laugh out loud moments and not a single boring sequence. The suspense is very well maintained.<br/><br/>And the acting: Johnny Depp is remarkable as the quirky, somewhat childlike, Willy Wonka. His interpretation is quite different from that of Gene Wilder and while Wilder's Wonka was more suitable for Stuart's film, Depp's wacky Wonka is the requirement of Burton's adaptation. The supporting cast that includes Christopher Lee, Helena Bonham Carter, Noah Taylor, David Kelly, Deep Roy and Missi Pyle are great. Freddie Highmore does an adequate job. The kids who play the hateful contestants do a fine job in irritating the viewer (which is intentional of course).<br/><br/>'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory' is among the director's exceptional works. Tim Burton has spoken to the child inside us. I'd recommend everyone to watch it with their family and celebrate the kid inside while having some chocolate."
"clare-cooney","10","1","5","22 January 2006"," Scrumptious
","Burton and Dahl are one of those natural matches which are destined to work - as he's proved before. It's not simply unfair to compare this to the Gene Wilder film, it's pointless, since it's making no attempt to be like it. Criticism of this film I think has largely been by those who've seen the other film but not read the book. Had there been no previous filming of it, this would have been immediately proclaimed as the masterpiece that it is. So for those of us who love the sharpness of Dahl's book but are less keen on Wilder's manic Wonka, this is a dream come true. As you'd expect from Burton, it's visually stunning and Willy and Charlie both have the look of the original line drawings from the book. The songs use Dahl's own lyrics - albeit in a marvelous variety of genres - and the script is great. Best of all, where the gentle moments might lean towards schmaltz, Burton's sinister touch keeps the saccharine at bay. Depp is a wonderful, paranoid, androgynous recluse - part Howard Hughes, part Edward scissorhands - and he's delightfully unpleasant to the vile, vile children. In short, this film is just like chocolate should be - bittersweet and dark, no artificial sweeteners and beautifully presented. Oh and beware of the squirrels....."
"cscmirzanli","10","1","5","23 December 2005"," Wow!!
","From the moment I saw the names Tim Burton, Johnny Depp and Danny Elfman all accredited to the same film, I knew it would be a fantastic movie..............I was not disappointed. When you combine the pure genius of Burtons visuals, with Depps acting and Elfmans musical genius, it is impossible not to create a magical, enchanting and thoroughly memorable film.<br/><br/>Burton and Depp have worked together a few times now (Edward Sissor Hands, Ed Wood and Sleepy Hollow), this is their fourth film together, and they just keep getting better (The Corpse Bride came after the film I am discussing). This film is much truer to Roald Dahl's classic book than the original, resulting in a darker film, even slightly disturbing in places, but it is all part of the fun. Burton and Dahl are so alike in their eccentricities and quite warped imaginations, that Burton is the obvious choice to direct the film. The visuals are stunning and will leave you wanting more. Wonka, at times, appears a little twisted, yet somehow he is likable and you end up caring about the two main characters; Charlie and Wonka. This is mainly due to Johnny Depps original and touching portrayal of Wonka. Depp has worked with Freddie Highmore (Charlie) before, in Finding Netherland. These two actors have amazing chemistry, and the bond that slowly forms between them throughout the film is utterly believable.<br/><br/>I saw this film on the big screen, then bought it asap on DVD, I can not get enough of it. If you want your senses stimulated then this is the film for you, it has fabulous music, amazing visuals and you can almost taste the chocolate. This is a film for all the family, the children will love the fairly simple plot and breathtaking scenery, but the grown ups will relish the innuendo's and intelligent but subtle adult humour.

","I was just amazed when I saw this movie in theaters. This movie was truly something spectacular to me. It just blew me away to see how well Johnny Depp acted as Willy Wonka. His costume, his voice, and facial expressions were what totally made the character. I was practically laughing every minute. This movie is about 100% better than the original. I loved all the rooms, especially the Inventing Room which is one of my favorites and I loved the new Oompa-Loompa songs. Those songs just cracked me up. It was like a miracle how all those squirrels were real and they trained them so well for the movie. I always laugh when the squirrels knock on Veruca's forehead to test to see if she's a bad nut. I laugh at the parts when something bad happens to all the rotten children.<br/><br/>I love the way that Willy Wonka reacts to every situation. He seems to say all the right words for the movie. Johnny Depp and Tim Burton just blew me away. The performance of the characters were awesome and totally matched the characters. This is more accurate to the classic children's book written by Roald Dahl.<br/><br/>If you are a big fan of Johnny Depp, Tim Burton, Freddie Highmore, or all three then this is a definitely a must see!!!"
"FilmSchoolWriter","10","1","5","17 December 2005"," Entertaining, mesmerizing and lingering - in a fabulous way
","The brand-new ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" is nothing like the 1971 version starring Gene Wilder. If you're a fan of the 1971 version, you will either be awe inspired and hate Johnny Depp for doing better than Gene Wilder, or you will be horrified by the fact that you could like the 1971 version when the new one is so much better. (I don't mean to be judgmental, but this is most likely how you will feel about it) The first sign that this would be a good movie came simply from the name: ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"". Ahhhhhhh. What a relief to those of us who love the book and love it's name. The version from 1971 is known as ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"" - this should give you a few hints as to what it's like.<br/><br/>Now that I am done complaining about the first version of Roald Dahl's classic film, I can go on to praise the new one. First off, major props to Tim Burton for creating such a mesmerizing and lingering yet entertaining film. This movie has so many layers and therefore, such a broad audience. If you want something light and carefree, go ahead and see ""Charlie"". You can just scrape the surface and enjoy the comedic side of the film. But if you want something a bit deeper (but not overly dark), see it as well and dive on in to the mind of Willy Wonka - candy maker extraordinaire. The frequent flashbacks to Wonka's painful childhood are not featured in Roald Dahl's story, but they are very good all the same. Without them, this movie would be a mere shadow of what it is context wise.<br/><br/>Enter the astounding character created by Johnny Depp. Can you say Oscar nomination? He is both wonderfully funny and painfully sad, all in a moment's glimpse. You find yourself loving him and then hating him for being so utterly blind as to what is right inside of him. Nice job to Freddie Highmore, too. Of course, Johnny carries the movie but Freddie doesn't do so bad himself.<br/><br/>No matter who you are or what you want from a movie, ""Charlie and the Chocolate"" factory is the movie for you. You will leave the theater knowing you saw something amazing. It is mesmerizing and beautiful and will linger with you for days to come. This is guaranteed to become a classic in its own right."

","Perhaps it was that I thought Johnny Depp would spoil this thing and thus had low expectations, but this thing was AWESOME!! I love that this movie was not made after ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"" but after the original book ""The Glass Elevator"" and thus does not follow it but is authentic. What a commentary on society! What a thought-provoking piece! What brilliantly concocted cinematography. I loved the Oompa Loompas! I loved the ending. The way this story was told made sense. Depp did a fabulous job in this, as did everyone else. The way it starts--""Charlie Bucket was the luckiest boy in the whole world, he just didn't know it yet""--reminds me of Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet which starts with a spoiler. I cannot tell you just how pleased I am!! It's wonderful film for kids, although I think one of its aims is to get those ""grown-ups"" in the audience to remember and actually feel what it's like to be young."

","Sure, the remake already tells you ""bad"", but actually take the time to see this movie, just! Even if you're not a Johnny Depp fan, or you're not the type to sit and watch a marathon of Tim Burton movies, sit down and take the hours to watch this remake of the 1971 version.<br/><br/>We all know what goes on, but for those of you who have never read the book or even saw the original, here's a quick summary. Eccentric chocolate factory owner Willy Wonka holds a contest which he has placed 5 golden tickets in a special candy bar called a Wonka Bar (that's 1 golden ticket in only 5 bars). They can be all over the world, and in this case, if you win one, you get the chance to tour the factory with Wonka himself.<br/><br/>But, its centered around a young boy named Charlie Bucket (Freddie Highmore). Bucket's family is poor. He lives with his grandparents (from both of his parents), and his father works at a toothpaste factory, but he doesn't have such a good job, as he's the one who screws the caps on the toothpaste, and obviously, the person who screws the caps doesn't make much money. So Charlie lives in a ""shack"".<br/><br/>As you already may have guessed, Bucket gets a Golden Ticket (by luck of the draw by buying a Wonka Bar), and gets into the factory, as well as 4 others, and blah blah blah blah. You know the rest.<br/><br/>The entertainment for this film is one of the best for a remake. You laugh, you cry, you'll be frightened, you'll get grossed out, freaked out, every little thing is in there. Johnny Depp is terrific as the eccentric Wonka, who nails down the role of a mysterious man the way Burton would have wanted it, in any other way. Despite having damaged the funny and quirky dance numbers done by the Oompa Loompa's, they aren't all damaged, and are redone in a way to try and repair the damage, but it's already done.<br/><br/>The factory itself is as enchanting as it can get, and all roads (sweet ones) lead to happiness, which isn't always the case, as Wonka adds more than we thought. He has a disgruntled relationship with his father, and he has bad communicating skills (quite evidently present), which raises the stakes a bit more, and adds more flavor in the movie than the original ever would have done. Terrificly added by Burton.<br/><br/>A spoon of flavor, a Cup of taste, a Tablespoon of joy, and a stick of wit, and that's the recipe for the new version of the remake. ENJOY!"
"fjhuerta-2","7","1","5","13 December 2005"," I haven't seen the original. As it is, though... this movie is *awesome*
","Just like ""Big Fish"" before it... ""Charlie"" is so warm, sweet, and enjoyable, I do believe Tim Burton is my favorite movie director ever.<br/><br/>The lessons to be learned in this charming story are many, and the story is simply fun. Johnny Depp is creepier than Michael Jackson at times (his acting is fantastic). Luckily, he can be left alone with kids without lawsuits flying all over the place. The kids are perfect stereotypes for the Oompa-Loompas to trick. The scenery and stages are perfect - full of colour everywhere, yet as dark as any Tim Burton movie out there. The whole movie is a bit dark, although in a cheery kind of way. It seems as if the main characters have a ray of sunshine guiding their actions all the time, so even if you sense the desperation in Charlie's parents, and the sadness of Willy Wonka, somehow you know everything will turn out all right.<br/><br/>Even if it's a bit slow during the first part, this has to be one of my favourite movies of the year."

","Looks like I'm a lone voice in the wilderness here but those are the breaks. If I want to see a fantasy involving a boy named Charlie I'll stick to Cedric Kahn's charming 'L'Avion' made for probably a 20th of Burton's budget and barely a special effect in sight. I've never been much of a Burton fan - unless we're talking Richard - though I appreciate and accept that each generation needs an eccentric/rebellious/avant garde call it what you will figure and Burton seems to be this season's Godard. Okay, I don't have to go to his movies if I don't want to and mostly I don't want to but this time I read all the hype and thought well, why not, he has to make a half-decent movie SOME time so maybe this is it. Alas! I'm not much of a Depp fan either so I had a lot of prejudice to overcome but I gave it the old college try only to find myself falling asleep. I haven't seen the original Gene Wilder version so I have nothing to use for comparison but I found it screamingly obvious from the initial shot of chez Bucket, a blatant 'steal' from the National Theatre production of 'An Inspector Calls' to the 'cute' homilies 'my family is more important to me than anything' and only WE the audience can see these Addams Family first-drafts as the grotesques they are. I guess I saw it on an off day: My seat was facing the screen."
"themadhobbit","10","1","5","18 July 2005"," MINOR Spoiler - more a reassurance for book lovers
","In 1970, I was given a copy of Roald Dahl's book ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"". It was instantly my favorite book, only supplanted by ""The Hobbit"" in 1972.<br/><br/>I am a great re-reader of books. The Hobbit for instance holds the record  40 times. Other favorites such as Orwell's ""1984"" have been read 10+ times.<br/><br/>""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" was a book that I read and reread at least a dozen times in two years. I was enthralled, not only because of the story, but the writing itself. Mr. Dahl doesn't treat his readers like 'children'. The story could be downright grim in sections, but always  ALWAYS rung true.<br/><br/>Thus, when my mother told me they were making a movie, I was excited. I was out of my mind the week before opening.<br/><br/>Then I saw it.<br/><br/>On the way out my mom asked me, ""What's the matter? Didn't you like it?"".<br/><br/>""It was okay, I guess, but it WASN'T the book!"" I replied  completely, irrevocably disappointed at what unfortunately proved thru the years to be a Hollywood pattern  butchering books.<br/><br/>The movie was the story at a shallow level, but bastardized and worse still dumbed down, with all the edginess sugarcoated away.<br/><br/>Gene Wilder is NOT Willy Wonka. Great performance, but NOT the Willy Wonka of the book.<br/><br/>And so thru the decades I ignored the movie. Yes, I have watched it a few times since, but always seeing what SHOULD have been and always disappointed in the end.<br/><br/>I was very excited when I heard that Tim Burton was directing  ""PERFECT DIRECTOR for the material"" I though to myself.<br/><br/>I was horrified by the asinine rumors that Marylin Manson would be cast as Wonka. Luckily they proved to be just that ""asinine rumors"".<br/><br/>Johnny Depp  there's an actor I trust!<br/><br/>Then came the controversy  the so-called purists railing against remaking a classic!!! I considered- no, HOPED  it was Hollywood making it up to us book fans  the REAL Charlie fans after all these years.<br/><br/>Assurances from Burtin that he would be faithful to the book  gave me hope.<br/><br/>And so with quite a bit of anxiety, Lil Hob, Mrs. Hob and I ventured to the cinema this weekend.<br/><br/>And.in the immortal words of Grandpa Joe<br/><br/>""YIPPPEEEEEEEEEE""<br/><br/>They did it!!! They REALLY did it!!! They made my book into a movie and kept the spirit of the book alive!!!!!<br/><br/>Depp's Wonka is not perfect  I doubt anyone could be  but I will say that he is far FAR truer to the character than I could have hoped and certainly superior to Wilder's ""Wonka-be"" version.<br/><br/>This time they created the OompaLoompas RIGHT!!!<br/><br/>This time Burton created a cinematic version of the book that made me tear up with joy  the little boy inside elated that someone in Hollywood understood the material  at last!!!<br/><br/>Okay  they DID add some stuff to it  specifically, the Wonka backstory. But it was in the SPIRIT of the story and I think Dahl might have approved were he alive to see it. (I hear he also HATED the original butchering).<br/><br/>The book  the whole book  INCLUDING the Oompa Loompa songs are here.<br/><br/>This one is spoiler free, because those who love the book know what I am talking about. And those who don't  well you probably only know the original sin and may even love it. If so  forget about seeing this  because this version is the REAL version and is vastly different from the 1972 atrocity.<br/><br/>Instead of seeing this version, read the book FIRST, then see it.<br/><br/>I am so happy that Lil Hob is oblivious that there is any other version than this one.<br/><br/>Mrs' Hob never read the book and while she liked this  she couldn't get over the fact that it was GRIM in places and not as insipidly ""sweet"" as the first.<br/><br/>ONE SPOILER <br/><br/>Tim Burton made a CHOCOLATE RIVER THAT ACTUALLY LOOKS LIKE A CHOCOLATE RIVER!!! Unlike that diarrhea-like abomination in the '72 film."

I loved all of the odd '60s/'70s cultural references, and felt kinda 'privileged' in a weird way, knowing that a lot of folks probably won't 'get' them (I'm in the 45+ age group. ;-) And Johnny Depp is FABulously demented and sweet and quirky...

Oh... <br/><br/>And I know I'll get blasted by a few of you for this, but this version is being referred all over (TV/Newspaper reviews, etc.) as a ""remake"" and it is.

"buddahchuck","3","1","5","16 July 2005"," Charlie and the Chocolate Bomb
","What a freakin' creepy movie! Okay, so some might think that the first one was kind of creepy. Personally, I do not think so, but I am willing to accept this idea. What I am not willing to accept is that this movie was in anyway a decent movie. All the jokes seemed to die right at the punch line. None of the points of the book are carried through to the movie. Instead, all we got was a 2 hour barage of bad jokes, creepy looks and depressing story lines. It was clearly a Tim Burton movie....dark, witless humor and feigned emotion. Willie Wonka, rather than being this insanely happy chocolate maker is only an adult with a broken childhood. Charlie did play that typical role, and I did like the change of the Mike TV's character. But the particulars of the movie were really ridiculous. So Feruka wants an ordinary animal, no golden duck (I don't consider this to be a spoiler) and gets all fussy about that? No, that can't be right. This little girl is spoiled, and she is entirely too spoiled to want something as common and vulgar as a rodent, no matter how well it can shell nuts. The oompas, while true to the characters in the book, go off on these extremely lame songs (lame even compared to the original) and the whole movie just seems to lead up to Charlie being the only one left, which wasn't the point. If anyone remembers the book or the original movie, the point was that Charlie was such a good boy in his actions that he deserved to be rewarded so. A big part of this plot line had to do mainly with the fact that Willie Wonka hired Slugworth to test the true nature of the children that were entering the factory. I won't say what they do instead but this point of the story was sorely lacking. So from now on, any remake that Hollywood does of a genuinely good classic I will recognize as being pointless, promotional crap. Seriously, movies need to stop being nothing more than mindless dribble. (Aside: How many inconsistencies did you find in the movie? I found 10 then ran out of fingers.) Its just a shame that writers get paid for this low caliber of writing when there are people that are clearly capable of doing a decent job."
"captkevman","9","1","5","17 July 2005"," A brilliant adaptation that will stand alongside its predecessor as a classic!
","From the introductory sequence in Tim Burton's Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, it is established that the film you are watching will be completely different from the Willy Wonka you know from your childhood.<br/><br/>The basic story is familiar: poor Charlie Bucket lives with his family in a run-down one-room shack within a stone's throw of the most mythical and mysterious chocolate factory in the world. Against the odds, Charlie wins one of five Golden Tickets to tour Willy Wonka's factory, and we join Charlie and the four other ticket winners in a whirlwind tour hosted by the eccentric candymaker Willy Wonka.<br/><br/>It's difficult to review this film without comparing it to the original, so I'm not even going to try. The original film is a classic; this one will be a classic, as well -- but in an entirely different way. Befitting Tim Burton, this film is much darker (and supposedly, much closer to the original book) than its predecessor. This time around, we get to go inside Willy Wonka's head on occasion; this is a good thing, as this Wonka is a social retard.<br/><br/>The film is well cast: of course, there's the brilliant Johnny Depp, who turns in a delightfully quirky performance as Wonka. Grandpa Joe is wonderfully played by David Kelly (probably best known for the Irish comedy Waking Ned). The four other ticket winners are nearly clones of the actors from the first film: Julia Winter is Veruca Salt, Philip Weigratz is Augustus Gloop, Jordan Fry is Mike TeaVee, and Annasophia Robb is Violet Beauregarde. Each of them plays their characters pretty much identically to the kids from the 1971 film, although this seems to be a deliberate choice by Burton. The characters are updated slightly for modern audiences, but not so much that it takes away from the classic feel of the film. The rest of the cast is rounded out with performances by the likes of Helena Bonham Carter, Noah Taylor, and Christopher Lee.<br/><br/>Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is stolen by two casting choices, however: Deep Roy delivers a wryly brilliant performance as the Oompa Loompas (ALL of them!), and more impressively, Freddie Highmore completely owns this film as Charlie Bucket.<br/><br/>Once again, Danny Elfman delivers the music for Burton. This score is rich and mesmerizing, with slight exceptions that I will note below in the spoilers section.<br/><br/>*** SPOILERS FOLLOW ***<br/><br/>Johnny Depp has a way to mine his characters and come up with source material that no other actor seems to be able to find. Depp's Wonka is a tortured genius that owes much of his eccentricity to his estranged relationship with his father (a dentist played by Christopher Lee). Unlike the maniacal command of Gene Wilder's Wonka, Depp's Wonka lacks self- confidence and social grace.<br/><br/>The score by Elfman is rich and inspired, but the songs are weak and unmemorable. Yes, that's right: I said ""songs"". Despite this movie being billed as ""non-musical"", the Oompa Loompa songs are still there after each child meets his or her demise. The numbers are busy and overproduced, obscuring the lyrics and the message. They accompanying visuals are also filled with modern cultural references which are sure to date this otherwise timeless film for future generations.<br/><br/>Charlie's dad is present in this film, as well, and he's portrayed capably by Noah Taylor. Helena Bonham Carter is merely set dressing, as are the other three grandparents.<br/><br/>Noticeably absent from this version of Willy Wonka is the legal document subplot, and with it the corporate espionage bribery by Slugworth (the corporate espionage element does make its way into the storyline in this version, albeit in a different manner). On the surface, this doesn't sound like much of an omission, but it does alter the payoff at the end considerably. In the first film, the fact that Charlie returned the Everlasting Gobstopper despite having lost everything due to a contract violation (and a frighteningly disturbing tongue-lashing by Wilder's Wonka) won him the factory, which we discover during a magical ride in Wonka's Great Glass Elevator. This go 'round, the payoff is different and more complicated, but ultimately just as rewarding...and it's not just the characters that get the big payoff: the audience is rewarded with a wonderful variation of a familiar classic.<br/><br/>One of the most memorable scenes from the original film is the introduction to the Chocolate Room, where everyone enters an incredible, edible landscape. While that scene is present in the new version, it's not nearly as magical or awe-inspiring. Instead, Burton chooses to use that scene to establish the characters of the children and their parents. Probably a wise choice, since that scene is already entrenched in popular culture from the first film.<br/><br/>Other negligible differences from the original film include switch-ups in gender for a couple of the kids' parents (Violet Beauregarde brings her mother along, while Mike TeaVee brings his dad) and a change in one of the rooms visited (a squirrel-filled nut sorting room replaces the goose-laden golden chocolate egg room).<br/><br/>*** END OF SPOILERS ***<br/><br/>I enjoyed this film immensely, and I consider it to be a complement to the original, rather than a replacement. Both are sure to remain classics for many years to come. Burton has created an entirely new film that preserves the magic of the first film, but also manages to create some new magic of its own.<br/><br/>As a side note, my five-year-old daughter had been looking forward to seeing Charlie and the Chocolate Factory for months (referring to it as ""Willy Wonka 2""), and I saw it with her last night. She was not disappointed. ;)"
"bernardobrown","7","1","5","16 July 2005"," If you have seen the original...don't bother
","I think most of the comments saying how fabulous this movie is are from those who never saw the original. The original and the songs really captured the innocence of the book. This version while contemporary does miss a lot of the original subtleties of both the book and movie. I thought the original Veruka Salt was much better. Although in all fairness this Agustus, Mike Teevee and Violet are better. Actually Violet in the original was pretty good so it is a toss up. The parents in the original were all much better. Now for Depp vs. Wilder, depends on your age. I will take Wilder although Depp did do a decent job with lots of originality to a very structured character."
"MafiaSquirrel","5","1","5","16 July 2005"," The buzz on this film totally misses the mark
","First this film promised to be a radical interpretation of the source material. Outside of a few tweaks and twitches, like the squirrel scene which I loved (the moniker gives that much away), this is very similar to the original in many ways. I prefer the kids in this version, they're saucier and better cast but I'm not sold on Depp's Willy Wonka. He's not in the same league as Gene Wilder. Wilder's Wonka (say that three times fast) came off as smarter and his reason for being so reclusive and gradually more misanthropic were better. Sure he was warmer, I think Gene Wilder is incapable of not emanating warmth, but it makes his performance that much more striking when he does have an outburst or a callous moment. Depp's stunted development and dislike of p p p parents falls short of expectations and the opening sequence just comes off as disturbingly anti-union and paranoid. Wonka has little humanity in the remake and rather that being ""eccentric"" he just seems childish, simple and cold."

I figured there would be some aspect of the film that I would find rather unfavorable, but Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is a true work of art. I cannot imagine finding it to be better with any part of it altered.<br/><br/>It is a true film of pure imagination and vision. It's not your average movie. From Johnny Depp's and Freddie Highmore's performances, to the stunningly beautiful sets, to the outstanding soundtrack, it's brilliant. Those are my favorite aspects of the film, actually, but everything is just beautiful.<br/><br/>A film like this comes along once in a great while. It's a film everyone should see at least once. I would say it has something everyone can enjoy. It's semisweet, after all, just like Willy Wonka.

","Depp is a superb actor whom more often than not chooses roles for their unique character and not for how well it will do at the box office. Willy Wonka is one of those roles. Undoubtedly, the movie will do very well in theaters as well. Depp brings a humorous and sometimes dark side to Wonka that the character was begging for. I would like to compare Wilder to Depp but their is no comparison. Both men have played this character in such a way that Wonka comes to life. They play them very differently but splendidly, all the same. This movie is not a remake of the original, Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory. It is another interpretation by a marvelous director, Tim Burton, of the book, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. If you have not seen this movie, I must insist that you do so at once."

The film opened well enough, and although I liked the first act, I was constantly anticipating the appearance of Wonka himself. When he finally showed himself, it became apparent that the film was not going to get any better with him in it. Not to say it was bad; I liked a lot of it, in fact. And although I usually like Johnny Depp in anything I've seen him in, he just didn't really deliver this time around. At times it seemed like the movie I was watching was not the movie he was acting in. At the end of the film, when he is reunited with his long-lost father, I felt a pang of relief; not for the character, but because I could finally stop watching the film that, for all intents and purposes, had ended seven minutes before."

Filmmaker Tim Burton's dark comic twist to the children's classic novel and the cult film ""Willy Wonka and The Chocolate Factory"" and Depp's gleefully misanthropic channeling of Mr. Rogers, Carol Channing and Michael Jackson make a Dynamic Duo again for the most part with Depp as a mad-as-a-hatter Wonka inviting 5 guests to his globally famous chocolate factory and Highmore (his co-star from ""Finding Neverland"" and proving to be a real talented find) as the titular tyke attempting to compete against four other spoiled brats. The true star is the amazing production design concocted by Alex McDowell that overwhelms the visuals and Danny Elfman's hit-and-miss re-interpretations of Roald Dahl's novel's lyrics to the fate of the guests. What is misbegotten is the additions of a familial flashback by adapter John August in 'explaining' Wonka and the hyper extended exponentialism of the creepy little Roy as the Oompa Loompas."

","When I was growing up I watched the original Chocolate Factory everyday which led to the VCR breaking down. Fast forward 22 years and you can imagine how much I've been looking forward to this remake by the consistent Burton and excellent Depp.<br/><br/>I watched the 2005 version last night and I've got to admit I was very disappointed. The plot remains mostly the same and for the majority of the movie it was like visiting an old friend. <br/><br/>Firstly I'll give credit where credit is due. The sets where amazing and the musical scenes where excellent. There was no way Depp would be able to live up to the original performance of Gene Wilder but he doesn't try to. Depp breathes a different life into Wonka portraying him as a vulnerable idiot instead of unhinged genius that Wilder managed to capture.<br/><br/>To justify my 5 out of 10 there will be an element of SPOILING so if you want to ruin the movie now and be disappointed instead of going to the cinema and being disappointed then please read on.<br/><br/>They always do it with the remakes so why not this? The film didn't need it but they have added a whole new back story for the Oompaloompas and Wonka that does nothing more that slow the movie down and take away from the magic. Do we really need to know how and where he found these little guys? During the movie I found myself feeling more and more frustrated that some of the classic moments that made the original memorable where either missing or tampered with. Gone is the classic fall come forward roll, when we first meet Wonka, along with the memorable freaky boat trip in the tunnel. Also the Oompaloompas are all played by the same guy and aren't as mystical as they should be. Other changes are Charlie now has a father, the children are no longer given everlasting gobs toppers and Charlie and his Grandfather no longer steal a sip of the Lemonade. All of this plus more has been changed to accommodate Willy Wonkas new back-story which ultimately gives the film a completely different ending which centres around him.<br/><br/>Yet again credit where credit is due the kids will love it but I feel this remake is tough to swallow. Beautifully made but can't compete with nostalgia."
"Elswet","7","1","7","16 July 2005"," Not dark...enough.
","This was somewhat of a disappointment for this movie goer. I expected all the hype to at least be marginally accurate. ""Darker,"" ""Scarier,"" ""more true to the book..."" <br/><br/>While it was more true to the original literary work, this director walked up to the bell, but did not have the wherewithal to ring it. His Michael Jackson imitation went a long way to give you a good feeling for the true nature of the character, but it fell short of accomplishing anything in the way of demonstrating the true darkness found within Wonka's heart.<br/><br/>There were Oompa Loompas, yes. One. He was duplicated and layered over and over to a laughable effect. While all the other graphic effects were wonderful, their ""cast"" of Oompa Loompas was just disgusting.<br/><br/>I was disappointed.<br/><br/>7/10"
"jdesando","Null","1","10","15 July 2005"," Depp does delightful disdain.
","""Everything here is eatable. I'm eatable, but that, my children, is called cannibalism and it is frowned upon in most societies."" So says Johnny Depp as Willy Wonka in the new Tim Burton film, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. That statement is an emblem for a dark and ambivalent version of the Roald Dahl novel, Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, and its original film version (1971) starring Gene Wilder as Wonka. Is the film funny or cynical, eccentric or malevolent? Both probably. I'm still thinking about the answer because, while Wilder certainly showed genial and grim sides of Wonka, his sides were clear and amusing. Depp is mostly grim.<br/><br/>Part putative pedophile Michael Jackson, shameless shock rocker Marilyn Manson, and redoubtable recluse Howard Hughes, Depp's Willy seems caught in combat with all three and no clear personality the winner. Director Burton, of course, savors the misanthropic side of Willy with nary a sympathetic character except little Charlie and his Dickensian poor but virtuous family. Depp does delightful disdain of the children, who are mostly, with the exception of Charlie, stereotypes of fat, overindulged, malicious, and fawning spoiled brats.<br/><br/>Burton catches the current fascination with the dark childhoods of leading characters, such as Christopher Nolan's lonely Batman. The film seems to be saved from Burton's uncertain tone by the ending, which reaffirms family life, even for Willy, who can barely utter the words family or parents through most of the film. Burton emphasizes, then, the clichéd solution to misery and poverty and avoids, in deference to the novel, what might have been a promising premise, namely that not all children are redeemable and not all families can count on love to get them through tough times.<br/><br/>Willy warns the visiting families not to touch the squirrels' nuts, another signal of the nutty film's ambivalent tone and point of view. I just wish Depp had portrayed Willy with a clearer understanding of the wit and wiliness of Wonka."

","I watched the new Charlie in the Chocolate Factory movie last night and I came to the same conclusion of the other super heroes.<br/><br/>Warner Brothers was like ""Let's put a main character on the screen who imitates every dangerous pattern of a child predator with everything he does and says, but create a storyline justifying it. That way children who are allowed to watch this PG movie think when they see this behavior in an adult that adult just needs their love and compassion so they can help him overcome his childhood problems.""<br/><br/>I'm not saying it was intentional, but it was super creepy."

","This movie is a true classic. One you can watch over and over again and discover new things and never get bored! The story has good morals, the atmosphere is fun and there is good acting to top it off. Wonka is so wonderfully whacko yet likeable and all of the other characters are played well such as: Charlie, Mr & Mrs Bucket, Grandpa Joe and the parents of the feisty children. We even get a backstory of some of them such as Mr. Bucket, Willy Wonka and the Oompa Loompas and how he met them and got them to work for him in the grand Factroy.<br/><br/>Each of the children are played on-point and they are all memorable in their own ways.<br/><br/>Visually it's a wonderful treat and the catchy soundtrack by Mr. Elfman compliments everything onscreen so well.<br/><br/>If you're looking for a movie that the whole family can enjoy, this one is it. Don't bother with the old, inferior version. This one has much more character to and varied atmosphere that will stay with you into your adulthood. I HIGHLY recommend everyone gives this movie a watch or FIVE. :D"
"MGPT80","5","0","1","25 May 2020"," A bit too dark, needs a drop of sweetness
","There is a darkness and eeriness to Roald Dahl stories that makes them a perfect match for Tim Burton's style of production. Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is particularly sinister and really, this should have been a masterpiece.<br/><br/>However, Burton indulges himself a little too much with some strange plot alterations and dubious casting choices. I really don't enjoy Johnny Depp in this role whatsoever and that alone ruins the movie for me. He brings no charm or charisma to the character and instead is just creepy and cloying.<br/><br/>Honestly, this could have been great but there is already a very serviceable screen adaptation of this book that features a masterful performance by Gene Wilder. A remake needed to take advantage of improvements in editing, costumes and special effects while preserving the warmth and wonder of the original. For me, Burton fails to achieve this and the whole production just feels self-indulgent."

Representation is also weak, because the children and parents are white and either from Europe or America.<br/><br/>Debatable holes:
1. There was no explanation about how and why Wilbur's house was moved (in just 1 day).
2. Physics did not apply in the elevator.
3. It was very coincidental that Charlie lived very near the chocolate factory. Otherwise he would not be able to attend.
4. The golden ticket was only sent to Europe and America."

At first, the scene of the chocolate villain melting can give I was very impressed. Of course, if we just use it as a children's movie, we can not talk about what metaphors are. After all, I didn't think of so many things."
"spotatoes","6","0","3","25 February 2020"," The Start of the Burton Slide
","I used to be a huge fan of Tim Burton. His eccentricities and oddball imagination made him a true visionary artist and his sense of humour was sufficiently askew to make his work not only funny but pleasingly strange and refreshingly unlike that of any other Hollywood director.
However, increasingly these days, his work is (I want to tear my tongue out for saying this) stale and samey, and the trademark Burton humour seems to have been replaced in large part by a need to show just how eccentric and weird he can be.
This trend, I think, began here, with Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.
Rather than being warm, charming and funny with just the right amount of weird darkness, which used to be the way of things when it came to Burton projects, this movie, as far as I can see, has dispensed with a lot of its predecessors' warmth and charm, instead opting to put the onus on the strange.
Depp's performance here, too extracts the intimidating aspects of the character of Willy Wonka together with any interesting traits of the character that have made him such an appealing and intriguing figure, and just kept the unsettling weirdness.
The positives here are that, in the main, the acting is pretty good; the look of the thing, as always with Burton, is lovely; and this version of Roald Dahl's novel is a lot closer to the source material than the 1971 Gene Wilder version.
In the end, as films in general go, this is probably about average, but, as Burton films go, it's below par, or rather, it was when it was released. Now I'd say it's there or thereabouts in terms of what to expect from Tim Burton, and that makes me sad."

","A Fantástica Fábrica de Chocolate is a 2005 fantasy movie directed by Tim Burton. It is the second film adaptation of Roald Dahl's 1964 British book of the same name and starring Johnny Depp as Willy Wonka and Freddie Highmore as Charlie Bucket. The film shows boundless mined children who, because they always have everything in their hands of their parents who are abusive until they disrespect, children who have lost innocence and whose sole purpose is to pass over others, except of course Charlie, only one with any thread of innocence and humility. A part of Willy Wonka's story about his story was unconvincing to me so the third movie is in development will tell from the beginning to where it came from!

"grturner-59687","5","0","3","22 May 2018"," Lacklusture effort
","Compared to the 1971 Gene Wilder version, this one beats it on visuals. And on music, if you like dance/pop music as the oompa loompa songs. The plot is also more true to the original source than the 1971 version. However, this one is inferior to Gene Wilders in every other way.<br/><br/>The films biggest weaknesses is WIlly Wonka. Something about Johnny Depps performance is off from start to finish. He tries to behave in a weird, eccentric way, but unlike Gene Wilder he fails to add any charm to the character. He comes across as a rude and socially inept character. His whole performance seems forced, an amazing contrast to how natural Depp is playing Jack Sparrow. Someone else should have been cast as Willy Wonka.<br/><br/>Charlie is also a problem here, he's a perfect saint like character, a Gary Stu. The charlie in the 1971 version was a good kid but he wasn't perfect. That makes him easier to relate to than the charlie in this version, who would never break any rules and altruistically puts everyone else before himself. Too goody two shoes, ugh. <br/><br/>Veruca salts actor also comes across as forced. She's a spoilt brat but she never shouts or loses her temper, in contrast to the 1971 Veruca. This one just says everything in the same, monosyllabic tone. The other golden ticket winners come across more naturally as bad kids, as they should do. <br/><br/>This film has some positive aspects, it looks impressive, the chocolate room in particular looks gorgeous, the ever lasting gobstoppers actually look like gobstoppers and it uses squirrels instead of geese. Violet turning into a blueberry is pretty hilarious. Unfortunately the film doesn't have enough hilarious moments. It plays very much as a ""box ticking"" film, it follows the source material competently but doesn't have much pure imagination of it's own. <br/><br/>As someone who grew up reading Dahls books, i expected a bit more."
"stormhawk2020","5","0","2","25 May 2017"," Not a bad film.
","The visions of Dahl and Burton perfectly complement each other (please see Wes Anderson's Fantastic Mr Fox as a point of direct contrast here) and the film is therefore faithful to the book in a modern transposition (for instance the updating of Violet Beauregarde and Mike Teevee are prefect, and fully faithful to Dahl's characters). It is acerbic, funny, unsettling, with a good fondant centre, immeasurably superior to the Gene Wilde version I grew up with. However, the British accents referring to 'candy' grates massively: please choose one or the other."
"il_conde","5","0","2","6 September 2016"," Missing a sense of place and time and focus
","It was hard to figure out what place in time the movie was occurring. A family of four grand parents, two parents and Charlie living in one dilapidated hovel in the middle of 21st century England? And they are white English living in terrible hardship? At the same time, modern video games exist, and a post industrial Japan also exists. What an odd mish mash that made the movie completely awkward from the get go. I could believe it if it was pre-war, war time, or post war England, but not the 21st century. The character of Willy Wonka played by Johnny Depp was another major problem. He was played (and also written) as a sociopath child - man. A kind of Peter Pan meets Michael Jackson meets eccentric foppish dandy. While this would be okay if he was a boy lost in a man's world, he is not in a man's world. He's leading a group of (mostly) wayward unruly children. It's like the blind, leading the blind. Johnny Depp's character provides no judgment or focus that the group on this adventure badly needs. Also, as everyone says, the Ooompah Loompahs are terrible. I enjoyed some of the visual production design elements. Those were fun to watch."
"mark.waltz","5","0","1","8 May 2016"," Pure imagination taken to the extremes.
","Who else but Johnny Depp could capture the magic of the character of Willy Wonka? Playing the character more childlike then Gene Wilder, he lacks Wilder's sarcastic asides, being more the broken little boy trying to find the list dreams of his childhood . Tim Burton's variation of the Ronald Dahl children's tale is perhaps darker and closer to the original from what I have read, but it is missing some of the innocence and fun of the 1971 musical. <br/><br/>The musical numbers here, with the Willy Wonka theme, are rather annoying after a while. The film is incredibly fun to look at, but the four nasty kids are ten times as obnoxious as the originals, although Veruca Salt is pretty close in brattiness. The Oompa Loompas aren't as mysterious as the original ones, and after a while, they remind me of a few of the ensemble numbers from the original movie version of ""The Wiz"". <br/><br/>This is obviously more about style than substance, and while the original had some strong moral lessons attached, this one weakly presents one perfect little kid with a feisty grandfather whose past at the Wonka factory is a nice tie between him and his local community. But, there seems to be some filler added, with Christopher Lee added as a Vincent Price cameo and a strange reference to a Buddhist temple made out of 100% milk chocolate that obviously melts in the first heat.<br/><br/>Helena Bonham Carter has little to work with as Charlie's mother. Freddie High more seems too perfect for Charlie, lacking the wide- eyed innocence of Peter Istrum. David Kelly is missing the old vaudeville style spark that made Jack Albertson so brilliant. Depp could charm the almond out of the Hershey's kiss and not melt the chocolate, but some of Tim Burton's work seems to be rushed without regards to the structure. Depp's hairstyle and costuming are a variation of a Bette Davis drag queen (with a Marilyn Monroe voice attached), and at other times, he appeared to be channeling Annie Lennox. <br/><br/>Impressive sets, odd costumes and bizarre make-up and hair styles don't mean bupkus if you ain't got a sensible script. The edible park set was gorgeous, and the boat scene on a giant gummy bear was frightening. Watching Violet turn into a giant berry was fun, as was seeing nasty Veruca being attacked by squirrels. The character of Augustus Glupp is just absolutely disgustingly presented, as is his porker of a house frau. At least in this one, the kids are glimpsed leaving the factory, but it doesn't appear that they are any the wiser. Hopefully, their parents are. It's a decent attempt to modernize the look if the classic style, but all is not creamy and milky in this chocolate bar."

","OK, so the well known crew Burton/Depp/Bohnam-Carter decided to do a remake: to be more weird and technologically improved. Did they succeed? Yes. If you did not watch the original Wonka, fine. Acting is fine, scenography is fine. But, if you watched original, you spoiled the whole thing. Because the script mostly follows the original one. You know what is going to happen. They did put a ""one more candy"" to trick us when Charlie gets the card, but still, everything is so predictable, I don't see a good reason to watch this one if you've seen the original version. Also, I believe the whole concept of this movie is so 60-70's and that it is hard to bring it to our time, despite the effects and stuff."

One example in consistency to the book is that There are squirrels who after gnawing on Veruca find that she's a bad nut and so they then had dispensed with her.While in the Gene Wilder Movie they have Golden Geese and Veruca was a bad egg and upon standing on the Egg-dictator gets rejected for being a bad egg and so then her Father follows to catch up with her.Upon being asked a question Wonka then says that that very incinerator is only lit every other day and so they may have a good sporting chance.<br/><br/>Freddie Highhmore as Charlie and Johnny Depp as Willie Wonka do another great teaming like they Did in ""Finding Neverland.""As The boy named Peter and J.M.Barrie.Each of whom were The Inspiration for the Play of""Peter Pan.""of which later got to became a book.J.M.

","Tim Burton's weird adaption of Roald Dahl's novel is a partly hilarious movie that stars a fantastic Johnny Depp as the maverick chocolatier and Freddie Highmore as the eponymous boy who is allowed to pay a visit to the former's mysterious chocolate factory. While the funny, yet not at all musically complex musical numbers are a welcome and amusing gimmick and Depp provides all-ages-entertainment at its best, very little of this movie stays in memory. The production design and the costumes are impressive, but it's the 21st century and a creative director like Mr. Burton could've really made more out of the source material. Furthermore, most of the movie's cast is miserable and extremely overacts their parts. The bad performances are also bred by the utterly silly screenplay that may contain good laughs for pre-school kids, however, is oftentimes boring and really cheaply written. I can't help myself but think that Mr. Burton didn't even utilize half of the potential that the original story has. But besides that, it's a very enjoyable family movie that has truly humorous scenes for both kids and adults."
"JoshSharpe","9","0","5","28 September 2012"," If only Roald Dahl had been alive to see this
","If only Roald Dahl had been alive to see this. One of the greatest children's authors of all time, Roald Dahl, wrote the story of ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" in 1964. In 1971, a musical film adaptation was released with the title ""Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory"". Unfortunately, Roald Dahl himself hated the film, so much so that he refused to allow them to adapt his sequel. Tim Burton didn't like the original either and, as he does so well, he put his own familiar spin on it. Johnny Depp was the perfect casting choice as the lonely Willy Wonka, with similarities to his earlier character, Edward Scissorhands. I saw this film in the IMAX theater with its release in 2005 and instantly loved it. I have enjoyed it just as much every time since and I still smile when the Oompa Loompa's sing and when Willy Wonka presents to the children his chocolate room. Although I was one of the many who actually liked the original, I find this one better because with the absence of the unnecessary musical numbers, among other things, this is closer to Roald Dahl's story in tone and in content. I believe if he had been alive he would have enjoyed it, as I did, and I hope you do too."

","With the release of Frankenweenie in the near future, I am going to take a look at the last few Tim Burton movies to see his fall from grace. I will not be reviewing Sweeney Todd as I have not seen it yet. Let's begin with what many people consider a bad movie, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is a movie I don't understand all the hate for. The movie is slightly less inventive then the 1971 version,but that was a very tough act to follow. The good things in this movie outweigh the bad and the bad things are problems in most to all Tim Burton movies but are just more noticeable here. The story of this movie is one everyone knows. The great candy man Willy Wonka puts out five golden tickets to take a tour of his until now closed factory. The tickets go to Augustus Gloop the glutton of a boy, Violet Beauregarde the competitive girl, Veruca Salt the spoiled one, Mike Teevee a smart but mean gamer, and Charlie bucket the poor little boy. The story is of course timeless and we discover the factory along with the kids. Great story. The good parts outshine the bad. The Acting is good, Grandpa Joe is pretty funny and so are Mr. Salt and Willy Wonka. The kids are OK, nothing special even Charlie himself is only average. I like the Oompa Loompas, the effects are amazing and the songs, while not as good as the original, are great. I do enjoy the factory, it is very cool and colorful and some other sets are nice. Overall, good stuff. The bad in this movie are noticeable, but are bad things in almost every Tim Burton. Some sets do kind of twist around each other.While not as annoying as it was in Batman, it is still very distracting. The movie also has way to many characters. The other grandparents, Mrs. Gloop, Mr. Teevee, and Mrs. Beauregarde are all just there and have absolutely no importance to the story. There is also a side story about Wonka's past which is just dumb and it has a VERY disappointing payoff. And the ending........wow. The ending is just terrible. but these are problems for most Burton movies so yeah they are bad, but not distinctly to this movie. Overall, I like this movie. It has a great story, good acting, and fairly good sets. The problems are very noticeable, but these problems are used in every Tim Burton movie. I enjoy this movie and is defiantly on my list of movies I like that everyone else hates.

","I loved this movie. I don't often give anything 9/10, but I thought it was enchanting, and mostly faithful to the original book. I hated the old movie precisely because it deviated so far from the book. The visual effects were stunning, and Depp's Wonka was suitably eccentric. So much is as Dahl described it - he'd have been proud, I think. I'll admit that it's decades since I read the book, but seeing Burton's interpretation brought it all back to me: I have a good memory for detail, and I think this did really well.<br/><br/>There are some shortcomings: the Willy Wonka back-story doesn't really add very much, and I think the Oompa-Loompa songs will look dated very quickly. Maybe Charlie (and the others) was a little two-dimensional, but I can forgive that.<br/><br/>It's a great piece of escapism, and a suitable morality play if that's what you want, too."

","Of course, there is no replacement for the brilliance and wonderment of the original Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory. However, I was thoroughly satisfied with the quality of this movie. On top of being a HUGE Tim Burton and Johnny Depp fan, I thought that the movie accomplished its goal in capturing that ""magical"" essence that is the Chocolate Factory story. The acting was top notch, and of course, Depp delivered a stunning and whimsical performance as Willy Wonka. The imagery,vibrant colors,brilliant musical score, and fantastical aura of the film all came together to produce one of the year's ""funnest"" films. In a way, it makes you feel like a child all over again...and that to me, is the product of a well-made flick.<br/><br/>I am not going to go all out and say that it is Oscar worthy, because it's not Oscar material. BUT, as far as movies in general are concerned, it was fully satisfying. One of Depp and Burton's best together to date.<br/><br/>Do yourself a favor and sit down with the entire family to enjoy this film.

","'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory' is an excellent film. Tim Burton does right by staying mostly true to the book. I love that he creates the darker version that I believe Roald Dahl would have liked. I love how the city is formed from idea that Dahl created blended with Tim Burton's imagination. Also I believe the set designs of the factory are of complete wonder and imagination. My favorite would either be the Chocolate Room or the Inventing Room. Johnny Depp as Willy Wonka I believe was better than Gene Wilder. I think he played more closely to the book. He was a hilarious and sort of sympathetic character at the same time. This film also boasts from the excellent music from Danny Elfman. His chewing gum song was stuck in my head for days.Freddie Highmore gives a delightful performance as Charlie.

"www-jats","7","0","3","19 January 2010"," if you hate croclate you like it anyway
","I have seen Charlie & The Chocolate Factory last night and though I usually don't care very much in giving my opinion, the journey M. Burton and his team made me cross deserves an homage. Especially with all that criticism rising around the film before it has been released.<br/><br/>I have been a Tim Burton fan for more than a decade now; I grew up with his films. But what I have been through yesterday his really unique. I actually never thought he would offer us such a film one day. Fans of his first period, with all the lonely and desperate characters won't like it for sure. Since Mars Attacks !, and more specifically since Big Fish, Burton decided to tell things differently. His vision of the world slightly changed in every of his films : now, the rejected freak comes down to the world and stays. A world that remains frightening and weird even thought we call it ""reality"" but a world worth living in. And that's what Charlie & The Chocolate Factory is all about It all begins with a main title sequence that may be one of the main weaknesses of the film. The sequence is very entertaining and visually ambitious but they decided to go with CGI and it looks like it was a decision they made in last minute. Since the film was proudly made with ""real"" sets, ""real"" Oompas Loompas, ""real"" squirrels, the main title looks inappropriate. It's not that important but it's a Tim Burton film and we know how much he usually works on his main title. Hopefully, Danny Elfman is there with a crazy mix of the Edward Scissorhands and Spider-Man (the music when the title of the film appears gave me shivers), a true musical roller-coaster that gives a hint on what his score will sound like through the film.<br/><br/>After that, it's just emotions. All kinds of them: laughs (many – the audience laughed almost every thirty seconds), tears of joy (we all know Charlie's gonna find that ticket but when he does, you just can't refrain your heart to beat faster), mercy (the way Burton depicts the social misery of the Bucket's family is really touching), amazement (the Wonka Factory and its many rooms is true wonder, one the most achieved design Burton ever offered us) and many mores. Very much like the book, even though it seems simple and childish, you would like to stop for a second to collect those feelings and try to analyze them but you don't have the time. It just never stops (I realize it might be a flaw for some people in fact). Burton never has been so generous in terms of human warmness.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp proposes another inventive and completely wacky interpretation here. I won't compare with Gene Wilder since I don't know the first film very well (pretty unknown flick here in Europe) and those comparisons should stop anyway. Depp makes of Wonka a tormented and unadapted character who doesn't know much about common courtesy and doesn't really care anyway. He built up his own universe in response to his authoritarian father and he's pretty proud of it. He just doesn't want those ""weird"" (a word he likes – you've all seen the TV spots) and boring parents with their despicable children to ruin what is life is based on. Yet So Depp's Wonka is actually very moving and pathetic in his attempts to entertain his visitors. As Burton does everything he can to make you hate Augustus, Vercua, Violet and Mike at the moment you first see them, you get instantly closer to Wonka when you noticed he feels the same. In addition to that, John August's vision of Wonka's past (including an always perfect cameo by Christopher Lee) offers the character a real depth you didn't expect.<br/><br/>Danny Elfman is also one of the main attractions of the film. While his score is already classic Burton/Elfman work with some interesting experiments (the main themes are splendid), the songs he wrote for the Oompas Loompas are just so funny. Hugh laughs in the audience for some musical choices. Those songs don't intend to stay with you for months (it would have been hard as they're based on Dahl's lyrics that doesn't allow Broadway impulses), they're just off-beat numbers playing with many references in so many styles. Oingo Boingo fans have to buy the soundtrack when it'll come out, it'll bring them back 15 years ago.<br/><br/>What can I tell you more ? McDowell's sets are amazing, Pescucci's work is impressive as well as Rousselot's beautiful cinematography. Some Oscar Nominations should fall here.<br/><br/>As for the ending, without revealing it, August's additions are really touching and fit perfectly to Burton's new approach. Even though the final shot tempers the ""family"" theme that he developed through the film (it's still Burton, not Disney), Burton makes you feel good because he feels good (and what I'm writing here will ring a bell when you'll see the movie). I don't know for you but after so many distressed and pessimistic films, it really moved to see that he found a certain peace. Charlie and The Chocolate Factory is a step forward in the direction he gave to his career with Big Fish. He lost his father, he became one, he's getting older and all those questions and doubts are expressed in many important and very complex images and scenes he imagined for the film. That's why I could call this film the ""Edward Scissorhands"" of his new period. Those films are very different but gave me both some very essential emotions"

","Tin Burton's re imagining of Charlie and the chocolate factory is a creepy film. Wonka looks like a transvestite. Well, it's Johnny Depp we're talking about so there's no surprise. I was not fond of the original film. I actually hated the original film, unlike everyone else. Tim Burton's version is way better though. I didn't think that Johnny Depp's version of Willy Wonka was as good as Gene Wilder's. Depp doesn't really do that good of a job, Freddie Highmore does a better job than him. Now, that's kind of sad. The film has an eyeful of visuals that are very neat to look at. The chocolate factory is cool on the inside, despite the creepy Oompa Loompas. They were terrifying in the original, but still creepy in this film. Deep Roy plays all of the Oompa Loompas. I didn't think that Charlie and the chocolate factory was Tim Burton's best. It wasn't a highlight to anyone's career. But if anyone els hated it as much as I did, then they'll agree with me on my next statement. Tim Burton's Charlie and the chocolate factory makes up for the original. Tim Burton sure is a genius director. He uses all of the visuals of the book and makes them come to life in this good film. Though I hated the original film, the book was good. so was the remake, which was high on visuals, but low on some of these people's careers. Not that Johnny Depp was bad, it's just that he wasn't at the top of his form. Neither was Tim Burton.

","This movie is good but everyone who says it is not as good as the first version of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory has hit the nail right on the head. That isn't too much of a surprise though when you consider what a timeless classic the first film with Gene Wilder was, he was so great in the role not anyone could measure up, not even Johnny Depp who is one of my favourite actors. Depp does a great job but he still doesn't quite compare to the way Wilder played it. The effects are obviously much better and the film looks great but this version of the movie doesn't seem to have the same heart as the first film, and it isn't really as touching. Still this movie is worth seeing and is still good, I think a lot of kids today would prefer this version even because it just looks more modern and has such a great set and effects."

","Charlie Bucket is a little kid from a poor family who wins a dream ticket to visit the astounding factory of famed but reclusive chocolatier Willy Wonka. At first, Charlie is amazed at Wonka's incredible inventions, but slowly he starts to feel a little bit sorry for this strange and lonely man <br/><br/>I guess Burton was a natural to adapt Roald Dahl's classic children's book about the wild, harebrained, rather loopy Willy Wonka - and Depp is an obvious choice to play him - but neither disappoint in this groovy, eye-popping, spectacular adventure. Okay, Depp may be astonishingly ridiculous, with fake teeth, a grey pallor, a pudding-bowl haircut, garish sixties clothes and a squeaky high voice, but that suits the character and the story, and he is so strange and funny you spend the whole movie agreeably double-taking at him. The other huge challenge with this material of course is the design, and Burton's artists and effects people have created an amazing fairy-tale universe which both creates Dahl's mad world visually and seamlessly transports us away to a magic movie place; before the first scene is over we have already left our chairs for a glorious Somewhere Else. Particularly inspired is the idea of having one actor - the talented Deep Roy (check him out in a great old Dr Who story called The Talons Of Weng-Chiang) - play all the Oompa-Loompas. Roy is funny, scary, does lots of crazy dance routines to the toe-tapping Danny Elfman songs which accompany the other four children's demises and must surely beat the record for most characters played in any one movie. The cast are all good, but for my money the best performance is by twelve-year-old Highmore, who is pretty much perfect as Charlie; humble, fun-loving, endearing and resolute - for another fine movie featuring him and Depp, check out Marc Foster's Finding Neverland. Stuffed full of silliness (see if you can spot the repeated reference to Plan 9 From Outer Space), this is a fantastic, absurd, heart-warming story about imagination, family and chocolate. It was the fourth of Burton and Depp's film collaborations (they've already made a fifth and are working on a sixth) and they have easily the most creative director-star relationship of modern cinema; I hope there are many more yet to come. Previously filmed (equally well) as Willy Wonka And The Chocolate Factory, starring Gene Wilder, in 1971."

","Many people tend to bash this film and call it a ""terrible remake"", but I disagree with those statements. Roald Dahl is the man responsible for one of the most creative and likable stories ever written, and seeing it get transformed into the vibrant film adaptation that this is was truly amazing. Yes, there was another film adaptation years before this one was released, but are people so blind that they can't see the obvious differences in special effects technology that this movies possesses? Speaking of the special effects, they were simply fantastic in this film. They made Willy Wonka's land of candy look so much more colorful than it did in the original film, and it made everything simply fun to sit there and stare at mindlessly in the sheer awe of its beauty.<br/><br/>But pretty and cool-looking special effects do NOT make a movie great (See Ultraviolet). But however, this film has FAR more to offer than special effects, believe me. Johnny Depp's performance as Willy Wonka was absolutely stellar, as I believe everyone expected it to be, since Depp is known for playing off-beat characters so very well. Freddie Highmore did excellent with the role of Charlie also. This kid could really be bigtime in the future.<br/><br/>This film had it all- Uniqueness, Diversity, Comedy, and as mentioned, Great Acting. If you're looking for a fun film that will please all age groups young and old, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is the ideal choice.<br/><br/>7/10"

","I've seen hat this film seems to have either very positive or very negative reviews, and in my opinion the majority of the negative ones are unjustified.<br/><br/>A lot of people don't seem to understand that the story is from a book by Roald Dahl, and was not invented by the original film. This version stays a lot closer to the original Roald Dahl story, and I'm sure many people that read that book will notice the effort that the director has gone to to recreate the feel of the original illustrations on screen. Several people writing comments on here have complained about the ""addition"" of the glass lift and the squirrels etc. These are elements from the book, which the older film chose to leave out. Also, I've seen people complaining about the omission of the part in the other film where Charlie and the grandfather start floating around after drinking some kind of magic drink from the factory. This was never in the book, and I'm not sure why people loved this totally unnecessary scene so much. <br/><br/>Basically, this film sticks far more to the book the the other one did, and I don't think it's fair to criticise it for that (especially seeing as Roald Dahl reportedly hate the original film for changing his story so much). If you loved the book, then this film is probably much more how you imagined the story, and in my opinion is far superior to the dark and creepy older film."

The recent was way too dark, Willy Wonka (Johnny Deep) played his character as way too confusing, complex and a intimidated negative role model.

Also, I haven't seen the 1971 adaptation, so my view is formed only by this movie.<br/><br/>Willy Wonka (Jhonny Depp) is a recluse chocolate manufacturer, who lives in a huge factory. One day he hides 5 golden tickets inside the candy bars he makes, so that 5 lucky children could spend a day in his magical factory with their parents. One of the winners is of course Charlie (Freddie Highmore), who is a poor, yet good and honest boy. The other kids are obese Augustus (Philip Wiegratz), competitive Violet ( AnnaSophia Robb), spoiled and rich Veruca (Julia Winter) and know it all Mike (Jordan Fry).<br/><br/>Together the children, accompanied by their parents, are lead by Willy Wonka in the huge factory, that is filled with whimsical gadgets, astonishing discoveries and small Oompa Loompas (Deep Roy), who are servants and workers of Wonka's factory. But little do they know, that Wonka has an ulterior motive of having the kids visiting the factory.<br/><br/>Visually the movie is just as good you can expect director like Tim Burton to deliver. The sound track by Danny Elfman is again spot on for the atmosphere and settings of the film and the actors do a very good job.<br/><br/>In short, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is such a movie, you'd expect seasoned film maker like Burton to make.

The director Tim Burton has great vision and the minor changes that he made from the original bring today's version easily into our homes.

","I'm a bit of a book purist (Fight Club, for instance, is how a book should be made into a movie). I read Charlie and the Chocolate Factory when I was very young, and fell in love with the zany darkness and hilarity of it. So when we were shown Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory in class one day, the only saving graces were the few somewhat accurate visual adaptations. As a little kid I was even more demanding, so the scene where they sign the wall, the floating Charlie, the ""oompaloompas"" (where were the leaves and skins?) and especially the ending just disappointed me. I wanted to grow up and make my own version, taken verbatim from the book but mainly with accurate ""oompaloompas"", basically anything more true to the book. Even now, it sickens me to think that they had a script written by the amazing Roald Dahl himself, and they changed it. How can you in good conscience make a film that the living author vehemently refuses to see because you changed his script? But that's not really what this is about. I'm just saying all of that to set the scene.<br/><br/>When I heard that Charlie and the Chocolate Factory was coming out, I outright refused to see it. I didn't care that it was Johnny Depp and Tim Burton, no one alive (Roald Dahl died quite a while ago) has the capacity to represent the book accurately, in my mind. And they still didn't. But even the things I was preparing to be upset about, like the ""oompaloompas"" (which, aside from their dress and lack of women and children were made short enough and interactive enough for me not to kill myself) and the back-story about his father (which I found tolerable because it was not done in that 'we're just searching for a moral here' way that I saw in the first movie). The kids were a little too modern for my liking (although in the future I'm sure they'll be too old fashioned), and I wish they'd included both parents for the comedy there. Johnny's Wonka though, was amazing.<br/><br/>I've had people complain that ""it's too dark"" or ""but Gene Wilder's is a classic!"". In the immortal words of Mark Twain, ""A classic is something everyone wants to have read and no one wants to read"". Simply not a good reason. And Roal Dahl is probably the darkest children's author. I think that Tim Burton's strange mix of comedy and darkness is very well suited to any Roald Dahl book.<br/><br/>Overall, I wish Johnny Depp and Tim Burton had waited until I had the chance to collaborate with them, but if I had to settle for an adaptation of Charlie without my input, this would be it. But I call dibs on remaking The Witches :P"
"vip_ebriega","8","0","1","13 September 2008"," Burton's trip to a candy-coated paradise is a wonderful excursion.
","My Take: Colorful visuals and elaborate storytelling. <br/><br/>Tim Burton proved that his talents can go beyond what is expected from him in his previous effort BIG FISH, which incidentally also has something in kin with Roald Dahl, who wrote the story which this film is based upon. CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY is less a remake of the 1970 classic of the nearly-same name (simply change the title from ""Charlie"" to ""Willy Wonka"") as it is more an adaptation of the book itself, of which many hail as more faithful adaptation than the original classic. Though I have not read the Dahl book, I say this CHARLIE is a great adaptation simply since the imagination, the blissfulness, the sweetness and the overall goodness of it all are there.<br/><br/>Burton is perfect for attaching the darker elements of Dahl's tale, but mostly he's in light mode. The movie is more cheery and dark, which is appropriate. There are some flaws rising when the film gets too sweet at a few moments, with Charlie (played by Freddie Highmore) getting a little preachy and too chewy for the sweet tooth. But, flawed as it might, CHARLIE is a lot of fun, and in yet another season of excessive potboilers, this one stands out as an imaginative and simply entertaining achievement. There's more than enough family entertainment value to provide treats for audiences here.<br/><br/>The movie keeps deep faith to its source with practically the same story: Eccentric candy-maker Willy Wonka (another winning performance from Johnny Depp) randomly placed 5 golden tickets inside the wrappers of 5 lucky Wonka Bars. Any lucky kid who gets either of them will receive a much-pleasant reward: a trip through Wonka's never-before-seen candy factory, with a secret price at the end. Besides the lucky Charlie and his grandfather (David Kelly), there's also the competent and overly challenging Violet Beauregarde (Annasophia Robb), the spoiled rich girl Veruca Salt (Julia Winter), the candy-mongering glutton Augustus Gloop (Philip Wiegratz) and the TV-addicted Mike Teavee (Jordan Fry), accompanied by their parent/guardian.<br/><br/>The world inside the factory is one blissful and exuberant creation. It bursts with life and color as we bedazzle at a chocolate-coated river, a candy-molded boat, workaholic squirrels in a nut-cracking room, an elevator that goes down/up/side/etc and the always present Oompa-Lumpas (as played by a duplicated Deep Roy). As the original story goes, the kids get into a lot of sticky situations, either due to their ignorance or over-confidence. But other than that, we also get to know the man behind the candy himself. Thanks to a couple of random but endearing flashbacks, we get to know Willy Wonka much more. There's also a lot of getting-to-know with Willy's creepy dentist father (as played by always creepy Christopher Lee). Then there's Charlie's family, a poverty-suffered member of society who manages to live life the way it should: a perfect depiction of a perfect family.<br/><br/>Visuals delight as morals abound, CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY is perfect family entertainment. A harmless yet exhilarating adventure where everyone in the family, young and old, would cheer. This is, any every sense of the word, wonderful eye-candy.<br/><br/>Rating: **** out of 5."

","In my opinion, this is the best movie ever. Many people are complaining that this movie is ""too weird."" Well, yeah. It's supposed to be strange. Gene Wilder's adaptation was strange (boat scene) and yet he gets no grief. If you read the book Willy Wonka is a strange man. Also, when Charlie haters are not complaining about how weird it is they are saying that the old one is better. The old one is great, don't get me wrong. However, after reading the book you can't help but say that the new one is far superior. It's almost word-for-word the book. OK, I'm done complaining. Back to the good parts. I can't say enough good things about this movie. It was funny, entertaining, satisfying, heart-warming (sounds like an apple pie). It's an all-around great movie. One more thing, Willy Wonka is not exactly hard to look at. Johnny Depp is a very handsome man. I read in ""trivia"" they thought about having the rock play Willy Wonka. I'm sorry, but that is messed up. OK, maybe Robin Williams. Maybe! But not the rock! In short, this is a fantastic movie. It's my favorite."

She is a selfish, rich, spoilt brat, who always gets want she wants and asks her daddy for some more (even she ordered her daddy to find the golden ticket).<br/><br/>Violet Beauregarde (AnnaSophia Robb) was the third lucky finder of one of the golden tickets. She is mean and selfish and is a tomboy who does nothing but chew bubblegum all day (she is a bubblegum champion who has trophies all over her house) and thinks she is better than everyone else.<br/><br/>Mike Teavee (John Fry) was the fourth lucky finder of one of the golden tickets. He is quite a moody and selfish boy, who does nothing but play on his games console all day (Teavee was a perfect surname for him) and again, has that look thinking he is better than everyone else.<br/><br/>Then finally we come to the star of the movie, Charlie Bucket (Freddie Highmore), the fifth lucky finder of the last golden ticket (who had two attempts trying to find the ticket, and luckily a miracle happened on the second attempt) and he stands out in the crowd, he is not a mean and selfish boy, he is a kind, generous and loving boy, who cares the world about his family.<br/><br/>I'm a huge fan of the book and read some of it and I think this movie is a wonderful adaption to the book and the movie writer tried extremely hard to make the book and and the movie match together (it would have been a disaster if they skipped a chunk of bits out from the book and created a movie with a very different plot to the book - who wants that?) and I must say you have to be a fan of the book to watch the movie, otherwise you might hate it.<br/><br/>The performances from the delightful cast were none other than a phenomenon, especially by Johnny Depp (Willy Wonka) I mean after, his previous movie, ""Pirates Of The Caribbean The Curse Of The Black Pearl"", he proved that she can shine and in this movie he delivered more to the audience, so that is excellent. And Freddie Highmore (Charlie Bucket) a young, wonderful actor, who I've seen in ""Five Children and It"" is an inspiration to young ones, who always wanted to be an actor and that is marvellous, well done Freddie! <br/><br/>The plot was well thought out and thankfully it didn't have too many characters and plots (best stick to no more than 10 characters) otherwise the movie will get confusing and a little boring. And it was followed in Roald Dahl's words (Author of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory) from beginning to end and it was very solid, which is excellent.<br/><br/>The Chocolate factory looked absolutely spectacular, it's like when you see it, your mouths start watering and you are desperate to eat it. It looked unbelievably creative, it was all followed in the book's words and it is the best thing about this movie.<br/><br/>The songs were another positive point to the movie, they were all complex and delightful to represent each child leaving the factory, because they were naughty (of course not Charlie) and Deep Roy was the perfect choice for the Oompa Loompas and he has a lovely singing voice.<br/><br/>And to bring it to a conclusion, a throughly enjoyable movie, aimed for all ages and well done the cast and crew for working together to create this marvellous movie.<br/><br/>8.75/10"

","Some things that i liked about this film were the family and Charlie. Charlie is perfectly cast, i also like the grandpa better in this film than the original and the mom is played by Helena Bonham Carter who has also been in Tim Burton's Sweeny Todd and Planet of the Apes. I liked how Wonka is not displayed up-front from the start even though we know its johnny deep and we've seen what he looks like in the trailer, by not showing him right away it helped add some mystery to the character which carried through out till the end of the movie. The special effects were very good everything seemed to belong in this fun world, nothing came across as a 3d computer building or bad use of special effects.In this story they go into Willy Wonka's past too his child hood which really helped me to understand this character something the original really didn't do also they give us a better understanding of how this chocolate factory works, example the oompa loompas have a back-story that perfectly explains why they would want to work in this factory.Some things I didn't like about this movie were unfortunately the oompa lumps they really didn't work or should I say he didn't work for me at all being as its only one actor being duplicated on screen. The actor was good but I felt like I was seeing the same actor duplicated and not individual oompa loompas that looked alike. Also the oompa loompa songs weren't anything to remember they were actually really annoying and slowed the movie down, I was actually hoping to hear Deep sing since Gene Wilder sang in the original but there was no singing from Deep here.If you are a fan of the original Willy Wonk and the Chocolate Factory and Burton and Deep's collaboration's like Ed Wood,Sweeney Todd,and Edward Scissor Hands then you will probably like this movie as well."

If you were lucky enough to catch the original film with Gene Wilder in 1971 then you would have really appreciated the thought and dedication that went into the film.<br/><br/>The effects and acting were stunning, none more so than Wilder. Now we find it hard to find a film without heavy dollops of animation, particularly in the fantasy genre.<br/><br/>Yes the graphics in this Tim Burton adaptation are good, as is his direction, but there is no real beating the original.<br/><br/>Depp's portrayal of the chocolate maker is very interesting to watch, an almost complete contrast to Wilder's. Wonka is portrayed by Depp as closed off, harsh and very insecure. This was based on his father's treatment, an interesting sub story which was not in the original.<br/><br/>Personally I was not a fan of this portrayal as I had always imagined Wonka differently, but it was interesting to watch and understand.<br/><br/>Highmore is good as Charlie, a more likable young kid than Peter Ostrum was. Though his constant pestering of Wonka can be annoying, his general character is sad and his helping has to be admired.<br/><br/>The plot is fairly consistent, with many up and down moments. It isn't predictable but isn't funny either. The acting isn't the best and although the effects and dark opening are really impressive, it is a pretty average fantasy comedy."

Come on!) I said to myself: 'oh brother, another lame remake of a classic'. Boy was I wrong! Now, hold on a minute, I'm not saying that it was better than the original, but it was still quite impressive. I loved Johnny's portrayal of Wonka, he was animated and funny; and the innocence of Charlie and his family was well preserved. All the characters were true to form and the added scenario of Wonka's relationship with his father was nice. Don't get me wrong, not all of this movie was on par with the original; the oompa loompa songs, for example. No, *those* were terrible compared to the original; and the ending was somewhat strange. But, all and all, this movie was funny, true to form and not a disappointment."

","Ever since the original Edward Scissorhands success of Tim Burton, Burton seems more content to try and remake prior films than to go after something new & original. His results doing this are mixed depending upon which remake you look at.<br/><br/>This one is one of his better efforts at remaking Willy Wonka & The Chocolate Factory. His cast includes Johnny Depp (Chocolat experienced) and a good supporting group. The original Gene Wilder film is not a classic and this new version does not raise that level.<br/><br/>While I can't recommend this as a classic film, it is as watchable as the original, kind of like comparing Gene Wilder & Depp is comparing a Hershey Bar with a Nestle one. Both these films are a different flavor of the same thing, both with good taste, but neither a really premium brand of chocolate too die for."

In this movie, he conserves a ton of his inner childish spirit and introduces us in a very colorful world, with very imaginative and astonishing scenarios that will leave you dazzled, and circus like music that will introduce you Deep into the movie's atmosphere. Johnny Depp personifies the character of Willy Wonka truly well. All of this eccentric conjunction makes you laugh and watch every single detail.

Which is Based on a novel by Roald Dahl (James and the Giant Peach, Matilda, The Witches). Highmore's performance in the film is the heart of this picture, Deep's role seems to do an creepy imitation of Controvesial Pop-Star:Michael Jackson at times but it's Deep Roy's role (Who plays all the Oompa Loompas) steals the show with amazing music score by Danny Elfman (Men in Black, Nacho Libre, Sleepy Hallow). Beautiful production designs by Alex McDowell (The Crow, Fight Club, Minority Report) are also the highlights of this movie as well.<br/><br/>DVD has an sharp Pan & Scan (1.33:1) transfer and an strong Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. DVD has an featurette about Roy's role and creating Oompa Loompas for the film, an Oompa Loompas dance machine featurette and the original theatrical trailer. The first act of the film works great until we enter ""The Chocolate Factory"". The film turns mean-spirited, odd, bizarre and dumb all at once. Highmore keeps the film together, however and it is certainly Burton's strangest Mainstream film since ""Batman Returns"". It is also the least successful Burton film (to me anyway) so far. Deep's role isn't as memorable as we expect and he doesn't come close to surpass Gene Wilder's role in the film. But Kids will love it, so do fans of Burton's work and Deep's roles as well.

","Truly a wonderful movie. It's so close to the book that event he oompa loompa songs are close, with a few lines taken out of the originals in the book. The attitudes of the golden ticket finders are perfect. <br/><br/>Makeup on Willy Wonka was perfect, considering how he never set foot out of the factory since he reopened the factory and found his loyal workers. Even the minute detail was taken care of, considering his coat in the scene beginning with the children's introductions of themselves. <br/><br/>Definitely a Tim Burton classic film. Even though based on a book so closely, he added his special memorable touches. The candy room was perfect for such, with the chocolate waterfall casting a slight darkness over the room, yet filled with brilliant candies and colors. I was even surprised when I first watched this in theaters how much they cared about detail that they actually made candy grass, just like in the book. Only thing about that, was it actually minty?<br/><br/>Tim Burton even added Johnny Depp's normal movie position, something wrong with the character's mind. TThe way he did it was perfect, the transitions so smooth, if they weren't there, it wouldn't explain the intentions of Willy Wonka, although it wasn't mentioned in the book about his past, only the present life in the factory.<br/><br/>I could continue praising everything that was accomplished throughout the film, but it'd be better to see for yourself and watch it.

"DeanNYC","7","0","1","27 June 2007"," Bigger, Not Better
","The biggest problem with ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" occurs when you compare it to the Anthony Newley/Leslie Bricusse musical version, ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory."" And there are a lot of comparisons to be made between these two films.<br/><br/>Of course, this version has the Burton touch of bizarre whimsy. And Freddie Highmore is charming enough as Charlie Bucket, but he doesn't have much to do. In fact, all of the golden ticket holders perform well with what they get. But the fact is, there isn't any way even a talented director like Burton could tell this tale any better, so he did the only thing he could do: he told it bigger.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, there is not a lot of charm to this ""oversized"" edition, and even the opening titles, which mimics the original candy factory production sequence, seems more sinister, not inviting as the original was. The point was this candy factory is where people wanted to go, and that attraction is missing here. And without that attraction, why would anyone want to buy the candy bars to win the chance to visit it?<br/><br/>The use of Deep Roy as every oompa-loompa was a somewhat amusing trick and those production numbers featuring him/them were good. Generally speaking, the special effects overall are staggering, which is where this version excels beyond the first.<br/><br/>But Johnny Depp cannot equal Gene Wilder's brilliant portrayal, and that's where the film lacks the most. Despite the constant denials, Depp seems to be channeling a latter day Michael Jackson in his performance. How could such a freak have created such a massive factory? Where Wilder's Wonka could convincingly be thought of as a well planned businessman, Depp's Wonka is just a glorified ten year old or Pee-Wee Herman. Who would believe that such an innocent could make everything in that factory happen? <br/><br/>Even with this criticism, I can say this is not a horrible film in the least, it's just not as good as the first. When there is a moment in the film that is similar to the original (and there are many such moments), it is clear where it fails. And the irony is the original film, which had Willy Wonka's name in the title, probably should have been the name of this film, with several looks into the past of the chocolatier.<br/><br/>Despite this, if we could only keep either ""Willy Wonka"" or ""Charlie,"" this would not be the one to survive."
"elfflame","7","0","1","23 June 2007"," Overall interesting, but not as good as the original
","The first thing I must say is that I read this or was read this book when I was very small, so I can't recall the differences between the Musical and the book. Despite that, I could tell that there were a lot of places in the movie that went back to the original source material, just from what I remembered. I also think Tim had a huge impact on the changes from the original storyline, and anyone who knows his work will see it.<br/><br/>I did enjoy it, but could have done without his special addition, to be honest.<br/><br/>Johnny- I love Johnny. I'm a fan from way back in the teen idol days. I watched 21 Jump Street as consistently as my parents would allow (in other words, not regularly). And when he moved to movies, I made sure to watch as many as I could. I love how his career has grown, and how careful he is with the characters he chooses to play. They're always different, and he never plays the same guy twice. Even if it feels like the same role at first. I liked him in the movie. <br/><br/>But... when I first saw the original commercial for the movie, I was a little freaked out. And I couldn't figure out why he creeped me out for a long time. Until something made me compare him to Gary Oldman. His Willy Wonka reminds me of Zorg from the Fifth Element. Not that he was evil in that way, but in the horribly plasticky look they gave him. And I do understand they were trying to stylize him, but even so, it left me cold. And after seeing the movie, I also have to say that he just kind of floated through the part. He was good, he was believable, but he didn't always feel all there during some scenes, and I mean that in the not acting way, not in the ""he's insane"" way. As far as I'm concerned, he didn't claim Willy Wonka as well as Gene Wilder did in the Musical.<br/><br/>The kids- * Charlie was lovely. I think the kid they got to play him did an excellent job, though there were moments in the movie where Tim (or possibly Roald, I'm not sure if the scenes were straight from the book) got a bit too preachy about how good and wholesome Charlie was. Luckily, there weren't too many. * Agustus Gloop almost felt like he was a computer animated character before they ever got to the factory. But I was pleased that his mother got a bit more screen-time in this one. It wasn't just her shrieking about Augustus. * Varuca Salt was perfect. Evil and conniving and petty. * Violet had an interesting twist to her character: her mother was the one pushing her to be competitive. I also liked that she and Mike TV ended up with reversed parents. Instead of Violet's father going along, it was her mother, and instead of Mike's mother, it was his father. * Mike was the one I had the most trouble with, to be honest. Instead of being a simple TV junkie, which I agree doesn't happen so much any more, he was turned not only into a video-game-shooter kid, but he was also rather a genius when it came to technical stuff. Now, the technical stuff worked as far as his wanting to use the Wonka-vision, but I kind of wanted to see this violent streak, which they alluded to a few times in the movie, used in his punishment in some form. Well, now that I think on it, it was a bit, with the way the Oompa Loompas smack him around while they're singing, but it didn't seem enough, really.<br/><br/>Tim's addition- now, anyone who knows about Tim Burton knows one of his themes is fathers. Which is fine. But did he have to add it to this movie? It had themes enough of it's own. I wanted to see the bubble room--though the way the Charlie acted in this one, he'd probably be too perfect to try it. And my husband said he missed seeing the office and the signing of the contract. The father stuff worked okay, but I would have rather seen the original story, and not a story that was chopped in half and changed into a Tim Burton story... They just didn't feel like they were part of the overall story to me. But since I knew the story beforehand, that might just be me.<br/><br/>Other bits- I loved that the grandparents (grandpa Jo and grandma Josephine and grandpa George and grandma Georgina) all had extremely distinct personalities that came out on-screen. And particularly enjoyed Liz Smith (who played Letitia Cropley in the Vicar of Dibley series) as grandma Georgina. I loved the Disney-esquire entrance to the factory, which then proceeded to blow up and catch on fire.<br/><br/>I know this sounds like I hated it, but I really didn't. It was a lot of fun to watch, even if there were several wincable things. It's worth going, just be prepared, because it's definitely not the same."

","Tim Burton does it again in this clever and visually stunning adaptation to Roald Dahls' classic children book. Using his regular actor Johnny Depp as the misunderstood Willy Wonka, and re-teaming him with child star Freddie Highmore (following the touching bio-drama Finding Neverland), this new version receives that unique quirky feeling Burton creates again and again in his marvelous films. Being a man of vision and style, Burton paints the screen with surreal visions, showing us devilish squirrels and dangerous chocolate streams inside the spectacular Wonka mansion. As always, all this would never work without the pounding heart of the film  the story of two lonely soles finding friendship in the least expected place.<br/><br/>Not to spoil the plot for anyone, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory tells the story of a little boy (Highmore) who along with several stereotypic kids wins a golden ticket which will grant him a tour in the mysterious chocolate factory run by the eccentric Willy Wonka (Depp). The tour quickly takes on a sinister turn, as the various children get punished for their sins (think of a children version for Saw or Se7en). If you want to know what happens next, put your hands on a rental quick  this entertaining ride feels like a lucid dream and is at times more satisfying then the endless amounts of chocolate displayed on screen."

","This is not a remake of the 1971 version with Gene Wilder. This is a movie that is actually based on Roald Dahl's book!(granted, the last half hour or so and random flashbacks were not part of Dahl's book, but length needed to be added) I have never liked the 1971 version. Why? IT DOESN'T FOLLOW THE BOOK! The basic storyline is the same, but that's all. Now I understand that many things are changed when a book is put on screen, but this movie is just stupid. Completely taking out Charlie's father? Having Charlie's grandpa, his ROLE MODEL, convince him to break the rules and take part in the bubble room scene? It never made sense to me. The songs in the 1971 movie are good and they easily stick in your head, but the lyrics from 'Charlie' are Dahl's own words. Tim Burton's movie is not perfect, but it is enjoyable, and it actually sticks to the original material. That is why I give it 8 stars."

","Every new release from Tim Burton fills me with more dread than the last, knowing that inevitably I will be sucked into the vacuum of his visual drug-dealing. Despite my long history of remorse and shame at the hands of his opiates (""Mars Attacks,"" ""Planet of the Apes,"" ""Batman""), the misguided heraldry and adulation that is heaped upon this ""auteur"" always seems to break down my defenses. Why do people love this guy so much? He's a TERRIBLE filmmaker!<br/><br/>With ""Charlie & The Chocolate Factory"" I held out as long as I could, but my love for Roald Dahl's enduring fable finally broke my resolve, so with dread and trepidation (and after careful research of reviews from Netflix, IMDb and Rotten Tomatoes) I rented the horrible thing and, with trembling hands and clenched teeth, popped it into my DVD player.<br/><br/>My first feelings of regret came from the trailer for ""Corpse Bride,"" which, tellingly, uses the music from ""Nightmare Before Christmas"" to sell it's ""creative authenticity."" Admittedly, the latter of those movies is among my favorite animated films, hearkening back to those dreamy yesteryears when Tim Burton held such promise, with his wonderful early work (""Vincent,"" ""Frankenweenie,"" ""Pee Wee's Big Adventure""). What a long hard road it's been since then, with only one great feature to light the way. And even then, he didn't DIRECT it.<br/><br/>""Charlie & The Chocolate Factory"" begins with what seems to be Danny Elfman's score from ""Batman."" Or is it ""Sleepy Hollow""? Or ""Spiderman""? I can't tell the difference. His work has become so indistinguishable that it's simply a caricature of itself. At any rate, the score immediately sets us up for the realization that this won't be any wondrous experience, but rather a dark and sinister journey into the unconscious. The kind you've been hammered into.<br/><br/>Then the first act begins and it actually started to suck me in. Except for the inevitable inclusion of Mrs. Tim Burton (a thankfully understated Helena Bonham Carter), the film is impeccably cast and surprisingly warm. Could it be that Tim Burton has found some feeling for the living? The story's awful, ticket-winning children from around the globe are given extra dimension and what might be called (in a Tim Burton film?) motivation, making them appealingly funny and suggesting that this journey into their demise might provide us with real insight into Roald Dahl's great wit.<br/><br/>But every time Willy Wonka appears the fun starts to dampen a little bit more, his flat American accent contrasting with the dreamy Eurocentric storytelling, boding ill for where the film will be going. Wonka's final introduction into the movie is a perfect symbol of the Burton style of film-making, a cheerful but joyless festival of blank-eyed puppets that eventually bursts into flames. Anyone who's witnessed the demise of the Disney ride knows that when you can't think of anything truly witty, you pretend that something's gone wrong. It saves actually working out an idea. 'Nuff said.<br/><br/>It's not only with the introduction of Johnny Depp's typically one-note character (Why is this guy so beloved? He's a TERRIBLE actor!) that the film really starts to suck, but in the sorry excuse for a script, which betrays Dahl's wicked imagination at every turn. Willy Wonka becomes a precious adolescent more loathsome and irritating than any of the children touring his factory. In the book and first film, he's a vain but self-aware master of the polite put-down, but in this debacle he's a nasty, witless child with no point of view whatsoever, and even fewer manners. He's more a product of the San Fernando Valley than of the English countryside. Could it be that Willy Wonka is supposed to BE Tim Burton? One wonders why the rumored version with Marilyn Manson never materialized. IT might have been able to act the part.<br/><br/>The supposedly wondrous surprises and confectionery marvels of the Wonka factory's inner sanctum, although opulently imagined (but never convincingly rendered in CGI), are treated with derision, bewilderment and contempt by even the master chocolateer himself. There's never a sense that this character could have brought these things to life while hiding under his bed. <br/><br/>Even Wonka's eccentric phobias don't make sense. Immediately he's afraid of being touched, apparently a germophobe, but then we see him in flashback chopping his way through a jungle and licking the fluid from a dead bug. Who writes this stuff? THAT was the Willy Wonka the first movie never delved into, the wondrously adventurous explorer of weirdly right delights. But it's the last we see in this version, before it devolves into an ugly, unrepentant exploration of Wonka's damaged psyche. <br/><br/>Eventually, after all the confectionery carnage and bad, really bad, visual effects, there's an extended ending tacked on that supposedly brings humanity to the man. Instead, it comes off as just another Hollywood flameout. The whole setup has been a sham. The chocolate factory is an opium joint run by Michael Jackson. It's so robustly wicked that the only option is to move Charlie's run-down shack into the factory to bring any sense of warmth or family to the life of Wonka, the movie or the viewers.<br/><br/>Ugh! I've never longed for Gene Wilder so much in my life."
"pinkchristi","10","0","3","2 January 2007"," Charlie and the Chocolate Factory 2005
","Based on a popular children's novel, Tim Burton has simply outdone himself with this extraordinary production.<br/><br/>When Charlie Bucket, a poor boy of the good sort, finds his ticket into the palace of his fantasy, he does not realize the haven which he is about to be transported into. For the factory is indeed a magical world, with strange Oompa-Loompas, candy that grows on trees, and an eccentric proprietor.<br/><br/>The four other children who accompany Charlie into the factory are engulfed by their own flaws. With them out of the way, Wonka divulges into the real reason for the contest: he is looking for an heir and Charlie will be the one to succeed him. However, Charlie must choose between living in poverty for the rest of his life with his family and owning the factory of his dreams.<br/><br/>The ending with its twist did not hit the spot and left more to be desired. I think if Burton could have stressed on this part to drive home its message, the movie would be complete.<br/><br/>However, that one small flaw does not stop me from gushing about the rest of the movie. Johnny Depp is the perfect (and a little scary) Wonka. He sets the pace of the play and his childish antics are sure to make little ones laugh. He carries off the dialogues and expressions with roaring success. I also love his cheeky sympathy when a misfortune occurs.<br/><br/>Children of all ages including the young at heart will love this production. Holding audience by sway, this movie is great children's entertainment as even Wonka learns a lesson or two about family importance."

I was very frustrated about the songs and that they weren't the original songs. I understand wanting new songs to make a more original movie but somehow Ijust expected oompa loompa doopity doo! :) the end had a nice twist though that made me a little happier with the movie, and it did have a subtle family plot that was absent in the original movie so overall it was pretty good."

","...then you probably won't like this version. If you liked the book better than the Gene Wilder version you'll probably like this version. If, like me, your favorite part of the Gen Wilder version was Gene Wilder's insane rant in the tunnel, this is the version for you! THE CHARACTERS; CHARLIE BUCKET In almost all adventure/fantasy stories there's always one character who's job is to meet more interesting characters. this is him.<br/><br/>VERUCA SALT Veruca is a bit younger than she was in the Gene Wilder version, and if anything, more of a bitch. Her demise is closer to the book.<br/><br/>VIOLET BEUREGUARD Violet provided the writer with a problem; most of the children are fairly clichÃ©d, but an obsession with chewing gum doesn't tell you much else about her. Howevere, Violet was also a world record holder, so in this version she's not obsessed with chewing gum, she's obsessed with winning.<br/><br/>MIKE TEAVEA Mike TeaVea is an updated version of the character, but in many ways still true to the book. he's a hacker and obsessed with violent video games. He's totally disinterested in anything outside of electronics, he doesn't even like chocolate, he mainly entered the contest, it seems, just for the challenge of doing so.<br/><br/>AUGUSTUS GLOOP Orgustus is about the same as he always was. In the Gene Wilder version he's wearing leaderhozen (Which has gone out of fashion in Germany for centuries except for ceremonial purposes) In this version he's dressed like Pugsley.<br/><br/>In the story there's allot of little stories, back stories generally. In the Gene Wilder version, Gene just told the stories, and then not all of them. But in this version they actually had flashbacks, and even added afew.<br/><br/>One of the interesting things is that this story is possibly based on the theory that kids turn out the way they do because of parents (Which isn't always true; my brother's a criminal and I'm fine,) but never mind that.<br/><br/>Veruca's father is like a Genie. She has only to inform him that she wants something and he will produce it, and he's raising her to believe that that's how the world works. Her mother appears to be drunk. Augustus's father is a butcher and both his parents are unhealthy. Violet's mother seems to be a single mother but one who clearly is obsessed with competition. (Personally, I like to think that her biological father was a judge of some event at which her mother was cheating). Mike Teavea, not quite the same, but except for the cool entertainment system, everything else in his house seems to be pretty dull INCLUDING his parents.<br/><br/>Even Willy Wonka himself is explained basically as rebellion from his fanatical dentist father.<br/><br/>Grandpa Joe, in the book, was a bed-ridden old guy who's always talking about Willy Wonka, and as soon as he saw the golden ticket he actually lept out of bed and yelled ""Yippee!"" This version is technically accurate to the book, but I imagined it quicker, like a gunshot, and his voice more like an 1890's prospector. (Still, Grandpa Joe getting out of bed didn't go on nearly as long as it did in the Gene Wilder version.) In the movie his obsession and knowledge of Willy Wonka is explained by the fact that he used to work for him.<br/><br/>There were three rival chocolate makers who sent double-agents to work for Wonka and get the recipes. so wonka had to close down the entire factory. But he then obtained Oompa Loompas. He pays them in cocoa beans, which he works in anyway, so basically they're... not slaves exactly... but Serfs. Definitely Serfs. But every single one is an actor named Deep Roy, who is already a little person but they made him half as tall as he really is, so he comes up to everyone else's knees."

"I_Am_The_Taylrus","9","0","2","11 December 2006"," I Actually Liked This Version Better(SPOILERS)
","SPOILERS<br/><br/>I actually like this version better than Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory. Don't get me wrong, I loved the original, but I just liked this a bit better. A lot of people say that this is just a remake of Willy Wonka, but this one is definitely different. This one is much more dark than Willy Wonka. I mean, yeah, sure, the boat ride in the original was much more freaky and disturbing than the boat ride in this one, but the whole back story of Willy Wonka being a son of a dentist is really freaky. Plus, the Oompa Loompa songs in this are way more like the book. In Willy Wonka they just go Oompa Loompa Boopadeedoo over and over again and it got quite annoying and weird, but the songs in this are really catchy and fun.<br/><br/>I sure everyone probably knows the plot, but here it is anyway. A little boy named Charlie Bucket wins a Golden Ticket to the factory of Willy Wonka. Willy Wonka makes chocolate. Despite being poor Charlie gets a Ticket, and so does four more snobby and mean children. When he goes to the factory he is amazed at what he sees. The only thing is that all the children have something happening to them. Augustus Gloop is sucked into a chocolate tube, Violet Beuraguard turns into a human blueberry, Veruca Salt is attacked by squirrels, and Mike Teavee turns into a ant-sized kid. When only Charlie is left Wonka says that he gets to have the factory, but Charlie doesn't want to leave his family. After a while, they put his small house inside the factory.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a much, much darker movie than Willy Wonka. It is also much, much, much more faithful to the Rhoald Dahl novel. And how could you not love this film? I mean, Johnny Depp is in it! Anyway, this is definitely a fantastic film to watch with your family. By the way, this is not a musical like the one with Gene Wilder. This is not even a musical. The oompa-loompas sing some songs, but you do not hear anybody saying that the candy man can.<br/><br/>9/10<br/><br/>Recommended Films: Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory."
"Vomitron_G","10","0","3","4 December 2006"," Burton & Dahl: A marriage made in heaven
","I didn't exactly know what to expect going into this movie, except for the fact that it would surely feature Tim Burton's distinctive visionary directing skills and also that I knew for sure Johnny Depp wouldn't let me down (since he has never done that before). And, as to be expected, I got all that, but also a whole lot more out of this movie. Of course I knew the story already and I had seen fragments of the 1971-version with Gene Wilder when I was a very little kid. But this fantastic candy-trip into chocolate wonderland succeeded all the expectations I might have had.<br/><br/>I'll just keep this short and sweet, because I don't think I can add anything that hasn't been written before. Here are some things that managed to surprise me in an utmost positive way. For one thing: Danny Elfman's score. Now, calling me not a big fan of musicals would be something like the understatement of the year. But here the songs didn't annoy me at all. In fact, they were great. Elfman and Burton went all pretty nuts on this one using a lot of different musical genres. My favorite song must have been the one in the ""Invention Room""-scene. The style of the song features characteristics of Blaxploitation themes, P-funk and even some of that rocky funkiness The Red Hot Chili Peppers used to have. The other songs are very different in tone, and they only come up whenever a child meets its 'demise'. So the fact that there are only 4 songs in the movie, also helped to appreciate them a little more.<br/><br/>Another thing that amazed me was how great the acting performances from the 5 kids were (something I wasn't too impressed with in the first HARRY POTTER-movie, for example). Especially Freddie Highmore (Charlie), Julia Winter (Veruca) and AnnaSophia Robb (Violet) were amazing. No doubt about it that a successful acting career lies ahead for those kids. Johnny Depp's portrayal of Willy Wonka was simply delicious and the whole cast for that matter was excellent. I didn't mind some of the side characters weren't fully drawn out, because to me this movie is about the 5 kids and Willy Wonka (& his Factory). I also liked the side-plot about Wonka's childhood and the relationship with his father (portrayed by Christopher Lee). It sort of drew the whole movie a bit more open and made Johnny Depp's character more human (because all the scenes inside the Factory made him extremely surreal, which I liked of course, but still...). The things writer John August & Tim Burton added to the screenplay seemed to stay really true to the spirit of Roald Dahl's original story. Dark & twisted, yet friendly & humorous.<br/><br/>And then, of course, the set-design & set-pieces were amazing. It simply is every director's dream to work with a crew that talented. CGI was put to good use (sometimes you couldn't even tell what was there on the set and what was created with the computer). The ""Squirrel""-scene was highly memorable (using real trained squirrels, puppetry & CGI, which all blended together fabulously). And the ending was satisfying too. A little detail I liked was the way some kids came out of (or survived) the Factory at the end. It reminds you once again that this is a Tim Burton-movie and not a Disney-flick. I was contemplating giving this movie 9/10 (I don't even know why really, since nothing in the movie annoyed me, and it seemed completely flawless to me), but then I saw the second DVD with the extras (it contains a little documentary about the life of Roald Dahl, some very interesting 'making of'-features and some funny & silly games you can play with your remote control). And because of all that, I generously donate that extra point that will make this movie a Burton-masterpiece."

These lessons were not just hinted at, but negative consequences were shown and even commented on during the movie; I enjoyed those. The 2005 C&CF is its own movie as it should be. I wasn't looking for a duplicate with only updated special effects. I didn't like how the Oompa songs were difficult to understand at times and were not funny, memorable ones and were poorly done. Set to rock/metal music? Are you kiddding? (OK OK I'll compare it to the original: ~""like the Oompa-doompas doopity do"", the original movie had those songs you would find yourself singing long after the movie). I checked the ""spoiler"" box because I also want to say Willy Wonka was not really funny or simply quirky, but was rather creepy. And he's ~35yo and searching for a replacement (for retirement)?

In the flag room scene, however, we see Wonka as a boy walking past the Iraqi flag that contains the words ""Allahu akbar"" between the stars. As we all know, Saddam Hussein added those words during ""Desert Storm"" (on 14 January 1991, to be precise), which was less than 20 years ago.

","Having read the book, and seen the film starring Gene Wilder, I was pleased with the new film, and the fact that they stayed pretty close to the Roald Dahl book. The pluses were the chocolate garden, the pre-story Oompa Loompa scene in their natural habitat, and the squirrel scene (far better than the golden goose in the old film). Not so good was the flash-back to Wonka's father, or the reuniting scene, which didn't appear in the book. Also I feel Tim Burton missed a trick leaving no way for the sequel film following the book.<br/><br/>Unlike ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"", which as I type is being televised and looks very dated (pinned at all corners to the 1970's), I feel this 2005 version will remain timeless and a classic suitable for the audience the book was intended - children of all ages. The casting was excellent, with good use of the big name stars, particularly Johnny Depp as the most excellent Willy Wonka. The dirty city scene was so fitting for Charlie and his family, and the iconic chocolate factory in the midst of it.<br/><br/>However, one word of caution. Before you let your younger children see the movie, I suggest they read the book first. The morals of the story will not shock when seen in all their graphic glory in the film. But even if your children don't read the book, I would commend it as a good stand-alone view just so long as you explain the somewhat real-looking nasties are not real at all.<br/><br/>I do admire Tim Burton's work.

","Yes! This was worth waiting! This was the film that surpassed all the bravest expectations. Mr. Depp is probably the greatest living actor in the world now, along with Al Pacino, De Niro or Julia Roberts or Jodie Foster. He is the ideal choice for a role of a real freak, like Willie Wonka is supposed to be. He plays Willie in such a cool, unbeatable way, that you only must applaud his mastery and talent. His Willie is a real freak, kind but cruel at the same time, vivid and languid, as if drunk and very sober. He is a walking enigma and he is a true King Of The Weird. The scene where he commands one of his nut squirrels to check a head of a naughty girl is merely cruel, but so funny. It is not only Depp, then, there is a very god part of Mrs. Bonham Carter, and then, all the actors are a good, brilliant choice here. And the colors! From a gray, dull scheme of Charlie's poor shabby hut to the warm, psychedelic rainbows of Willie's world! Awesome work of the crew and the film maker... Excellent work, all in all."

The children who was chosen to go to Mr.Wonka's factory are five. They have their own characteristics; pureness, greed, instinct, none-bear, persistence. Except pure child names Charlie, others got failed their touring. Finally, Charlie got the special worker in Wonka's factory, but he chose his family first. This decision makes Wonka find his old family;his father, Mr.Wonka. In last scene, it is said that Wonka and Charlie's family lived happy ever after. In the original fantasy novel, The director adds the other moral teaching; how family is worthful. The Charlie's family who help him to be chosen the Wonka's party and Mr.Wonka who seemed he hated his son, but loved him very much show that teaching. With this new version of 'Charlie and Chocolate factory', Tim Burton made the other masterpiece of fable."

","The main idea at the end was really perfect. Family is the best thing in the life. The messages which was trying to give were also good. Forexample the spoilt girl whose father gives everything she wants was really in bad condition at the end, or the mumbler boy. To be good person, good family is needed. Although it is a children movie, I could find some clues about life:). Also I liked when Willy Walker had hair cut he saw one silver hair and he felt that he is old. But I feel that something was missing when I was watching the movie and I always guessed what would happen in the next scenes also I did not like the flashbacks of finding new tastes and the dentist father."

","First off I want to say that I was very excited to see this movie. I had read the book in my youth and loved it...I still do. Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory was a horrible piece of trash. It trailed off from the book too much. I can understand perfectly why they changed the squirrels to geese, but all the other changes were ridiculous. The highlight of the movie was Gene Wilder who portrayed Wonka fantastically. The 2005 re-make is something I had been looking forward to for years.<br/><br/>I must say it all payed off. I remember seeing this film on opening day for a 3:00 show. The theater was jam-packed, the crowd had so much energy, my friends and I had snuck in Wonka candy bars. This was the movie that made my summer complete.<br/><br/>I love Tim Burton and most, if not all of his films. Charlie and the Chocolate Factory was a perfect story for him. The look and feel of the film was right. The casting was right. The Oompa Loompa songs were funny and wonderful, and last but not least Johnny Depp was amazing. He certainly brought a dark tone to the character, which the demented sense of humor that is present in the book.<br/><br/>Every second of the film had my eyes glued to the screen. It was like a dream come true. Tim Burton had proved himself once again to be one of the greatest directors of my time. The score and songs made it even better. The Oompa Loompa songs were actually the lyrics from the book. And Charlie actually looked like a poor and starving boy.<br/><br/>On top of the this cherry sundae there is on more joy...the visuals. The special effects on this film were truly amazing. I especially enjoyed Veruca's departure down the garbage chute.<br/><br/>If you liked the book, this movie is for you. If you enjoyed the old one, you may enjoy this one very much. If you loved the old, I'd stay away. This is more true to the book. Tim Burton has done an excellent job on sticking to the source material. Keep up to good work Tim!"
"cherold","7","0","1","4 September 2006"," Am I the only person who knows what Willie Wonka is supposed to be like?
","This version of Roald Dahl's brilliant book begins beautifully. It does a wonderful job of creating a sense of wonder and excitement about the chocolate factory and Charlie and his family are quite appealing. And like all Tim Burton films, there is a great visual sensibility.<br/><br/>Then Willy Wonka shows up.<br/><br/>There have been two film adaptations of the book, and both have radically altered the character of Willy Wonka, who in the books is an affable elderly man. In the first movie, Gene Wilder played Wonka as sinister and hostile, while Johnny Depp plays him like a children's show host who has lost his mind (or, as many people have pointed out, as Michael Jackson).<br/><br/>Both of these portrayals were completely off the mark. Dahl underplays Wonka, and that makes him very funny. He simply acts like nothing particularly odd is happening and genially goes on with things as a series of disasters strike. But for some reasons, film makers want a more malevolent take on the guy.<br/><br/>Burton compounds this by making the movie more about Wonka than about Charlie. He gives Wonka a tortured past and drags out the story's ending, giving it a fairly absurd last minute and also making Charlie the only character who is not tempted by anything during this tour, which I'm sure Dahl would have considered an unacceptable change.<br/><br/>Still, the movie is really good looking, the acting is generally good (even Depp, I suspect, if you aren't familiar with the book), there's a lot of clever stuff in there and the original Oompa Loompa lyrics are used, and are musically quite good. The movie moves fast and it's generally entertaining. It just happens to be a movie made by someone who has decided to replace Dahl's sensibility with his own, and while Burton has made a few great movies among a bunch of overrated ones, he is not in the same class as Dahl.<br/><br/>Dahl's book is so descriptive and straightforward that really, all a director needs to do is take what's there and make that movie. I hope someday someone who really understands the source material takes a shot at this."

","I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. In fact, I like it more every time I see it. This version is truer to Dahl's book than the original movie, starting with the title. Of course, the special effects are terrific and Johnny Depp's performance is wonderful. (It disturbs me that people see similarities between Depp's Wonka and Michael Jackson - including Roger Ebert himself!)<br/><br/>That being said, I have to convey the opinion that, while this film can be considered a family film, I think it appeals more to adults than children. There are a lot of ""hidden"" jokes and innuendo that children would not understand and which may be, some perhaps would say, inappropriate for kids. It is a little more violent and certainly much darker than the 1971 film.<br/><br/>I would also go so far as to say that this is not a remake of the 1971 Gene Wilder film, but a different adaptation of Roald Dahl's book done brilliantly by Tim Burton, of whose films I am a great fan.<br/><br/>In short, a great film with brilliant performances. But I would think twice before classifying it as a ""kid"" movie. It's so much more!"

In my opinion, Depp's portrayal of Wonka was quite dark. I feel this movie would have been much more enjoyable to watch with either Jim Carey or Paul Rubens playing Willy Wonka. I feel the vibrant personality and energy of either actor would have brought the role of Willy Wonka more to life. Also, the Oompla Loompa's singing and dancing routines were pretty dull as compared to the original. Am I the only one who shares these opinions or does any else feel the same way ? Please share."
"MercuryPheonix","10","0","3","21 July 2006"," A film with all the Chocolatey goodness, but no sticky, sickly sweetness
","Having looked through a number of websites and read lots of reviews on this film, I decided that the time had come for me to submit my own viewpoint. I can hardly start to sum up this film, but I shall give it my best shot: WOW! I found that many bad reviews come from the fact that it is being compared to the so called ""original"", as if this is a remake of the Gene Wilder version in the seventies. That's the wrong way of looking at it; it is simply a different interpretation of the same story. I have been reading Roald Dahl since I was five years old, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory was only the third book I ever read to myself, and one of my favourite things about his books is the dark, perverted, somewhat macabre sense of humour he has. His books are not ""pleasant"", not ""sweet"", not always for little kids. And yet a review I discovered just the other day rebuked the 2005 version for being too ""dark"", and the songs ""not having the same pleasant tune"". My dear friends, we forget that these are the lyrics that Roald Dahl himself wrote in the original books, and also we must remember that this is Roald Dahl we are talking about. Darkness and dark humour was the key to his books.<br/><br/>I always found the original too ""twee"" for the story they were interpreting, and it always bugged me that the Bucket family in the original were Americans, whereas Roald Dahl himself was very British. I have never come to terms with an American Bucket family, not that I have anything against Americans.<br/><br/>I think Johnny Depp is fantastic as Willy Wonka. He takes the character Gene Wilder portrayed and gives it a twist in the right direction. No more niceness, just creepy, dark humour, and I love that. It's straight out of a Roald Dahl novel, just as it should be. Freddie Highmore; well you gotta love Freddie. He is an amazing actor, he brings an averageness to Charlie Bucket, a sense that he is just a poor, normally, kindhearted boy like any other in the world, which really makes him believable. And the rest of the supporting cast were also fantastic, especially David Kelly as Grandpa Joe...and how can we forget Liz Smith as the dippy Grandma Georgina?? <br/><br/>*Takes off hat in appreciation*<br/><br/>I really have hated the reviews where people have said ""the effects are not very realistic"" and someone said ""too much blue screen so that the actors aren't as amazed as they should be"", or words to that effect. From the programmes I have seen, I know that the whole of the chocolate room, the inventing room, the TV room, and all the other rooms that were visited were built especially for the film. That is why the effects do not look CGI at all, something that some people have interpreted as it being really bad effects. No people, it's just real life set, thats why it doesn't look computer animated. And I think the fact that the horrible children don't look at all bored is a product of great acting; if I had been there I wouldn't have been able to stop looking around and going ""woah, this is so huge!"". The kid actors really must have tried really hard to look as bored and as horrible as their nasty little characters must have been. <br/><br/>The background given to Willy Wonka **SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER** seems to be straight out of a Roald Dahl novel, and I applaud whoever thought up the idea. Tim Burton has that same dark bubbliness that Roald Dahl had in writing, and it really brings it to life. The idea that Willy Wonka's father was a dentist who hated chocolate, and Willy himself a kid with the misfortune of having a huge brace on his head is just...such an imaginative background for such an extraordinary character. And the ending reunion with his father, and the subsequent acceptance of the Bucket family into his factory, is the only really sweet bit in the movie, but not so sweet that it leaves a sickly aftertaste in your mouth.<br/><br/>All in all, a much more satisfying interpretation of a much loved story; NOT a remake of the 1971 version. I would recommend it to anyone because I LOVED IT! 10 stars out of 10, most definitely.<br/><br/>Yours...Phantom Phan (^)_ ^"
"fires599","9","0","2","15 July 2006"," My Charlie and the Chocolate Factory Review.
","Before I start this review, I want you to take every idea you have in your head about the first Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory movie and forget you ever watched it. That's right. No comparing Gene Wilder to Johnny Depp; No looking at how closely or different the movies are; No talking about this as a remade movie. It's not. Got that? Good. Now, the review.<br/><br/>Tim Burton's Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is at it should be-- Beautifully creative with that slightly dark undertone lying beneath it. This movie is just oozing with creative minds at work.<br/><br/>Now, over the course of years, it seems as though people have forgotten the purpose in which movies were made, which is to entertain. And there was not a second of C&tCF where I wasn't entertained. Did it have it's flaws? Well. Yes. All movies have flaws, but looking back, I didn't mind them very much. I walked out of the theater smiling in excitement.<br/><br/>First of all, this movie is breathtaking. Absolutely beautiful. In some scenes, I got chills watching it. I can honestly say this is one of the most visually pleasing Tim Burton films I've seen recently. And that's saying something. The sets are elaborate and surreal, just as I imagined it to be in the book.<br/><br/>Like many people, I was afraid I wouldn't like Johnny Depp's portrayal of Willy Wonka. To be honest, it wasn't what I imagined Willy Wonka to be like in the book. But I can't help but laugh every time I see Johnny Depp's goofy smile.<br/><br/>Willy Wonka is a recluse. He is out of touch with reality, and you can sense that. You really feel as though this character really did create all these amazing candies and invent this entire factory of fantastic inventions. He doesn't know how to deal with people, which I loved about the character. As for Willy Wonka's past Personally, I liked it. It was a nice little back-story to the mysterious person. I really just enjoyed every scene with him in it.<br/><br/>Do I have any complaints about the film. Well, like I said, yes. All films have minor errors. What bothered me was the fact that occasionally, I didn't feel like Charlie was the focus of the film. When thinking back on the film, Charlie was the last person I thought of. Willy Wonka out shown him on the screen. Which, technically, I guess isn't Johnny Depp's fault, nor Freddie Highmore. No, Freddie was perfect casting. Charlie was just normal, and the rest of the cast was anything but normal.<br/><br/>What about the other kids? Absolutely perfect. I was so pleased that each and every one of these kids got what they deserved. Mike Teavee especially sticks out in my mind, because he was a perfect portrayal of the video game-kids out there. I know kids like Mike Teavee, who think they know everything. And Violet Beauregard and her mom? Great! Not to say anything of the other horrible little children.<br/><br/>Oh, and Danny Elfman's music? WOW. Danny, you've done it again. The Oompa Loompa songs were perfect (I laughed so much with some of them!) and the score fit so well in every scene. Danny's a genius.<br/><br/>Personally, I liked the ending as well. It made me feel all cuddly inside. (Scary, huh?) So, in all, I say that I am very pleased with the film. I walked into the theater expecting to be maybe a *bit* disappointed, but it was just the opposite. I was thoroughly entertained throughout the whole film. And the more I watch this film, the more I absolutely adore it. And I'm sure children will adore it too.<br/><br/>Many people have criticized this movie for the mere audacity of making another movie based on Dahl's book when the first movie was a classic. But this isn't a remake. In my opinion, a remake shouldn't be about making money or updating graphics. It's about re-imagining a story, adding a new twist to it. Tim Burton had a vision to Roald Dahl's tale that he wanted the world to see, and he made a highly imaginative and entertaining film."
"hardrockstar27","7","0","1","21 June 2006"," Imaginative, Charming, Creepy And Entertaining
","Tim Burton's remake of the 1971 version of ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"" is imaginative, sweet, sour and stylish all at the same time. The movie stays faithful to the original but still maintains it's own originality within itself. Burton just seems like the perfect director for this film. He has a fantasy imagination to make Roald Dahl's dark, humorous tale come alive. Since he's directed movies like ""Beatlejuice,"" ""Edward Scissorhands,"" and his animated ""A Night Before Christmas."" He has the talent to creep audiences out, while still make the characters colorful eccentrics. He blends creepiness with a subversive humor that is always alive with energy, and his visuals always astonish.<br/><br/>As the movie opens, our eyes are filled with snow covered houses and the main streets of a town with all of those old candy shops and small vintage stores. Freddie Highmore stars as Charlie who's family is poor and living in a house that has Burton's artistic vision all over it. The house is slanted on each side and looks like it could fall at any second. Charlie's family (The Buckets) are all charming eccentrics. David Kelly is wonderful as Grandpa Joe, he puts an charming, eccentric spin to the character that is very charming and sweet.<br/><br/>He explains to Charlie that he used to work for Wonka and he was fired when Wonka closed his factory gates ""forever"" because some of his employees were secretly stealing the secret recipes for all of the candies. He was no longer the original candy maker because the scam artists sold the recipes to all of the candy stores possible. After a while he re-opened his factory, but no human workers were allowed in and everyone wonders why no one comes in or out of the factory but the candy wrapped and sealed ready to be sold.<br/><br/>This movie is correctly titled because it's called ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" and it is mostly about Charlie. I always wondered why the original was even called Willy Wonka because it was mostly about Charlie.<br/><br/>This version follows the same basic storyline of Wonka deciding to allow five children and one member of their family inside his factory that get the golden ticket that could be anywhere around the country on any five selected candy bars. The story gets followed on the news around the country on T.V. and radio.<br/><br/>There is the same concept of the five characters. Charlie is the humble sweet kid, the girl who is a perfectionist and a compulsive competitor, the fat boy who eats countless candy bars, the spoiled rotten little girl who is indulged by her father and a kid that plays too many video games. Some particular traits of the characters have been changed to match up with the present day and the contemporary choices; though little, separates the movie from the original.<br/><br/>When we see Depp as Wonka, he makes some strange choices on how to play him. He looks like a woman. His hair looks he borrowed a wig from a woman, and his tone of voice and the way he carries himself is like Michael Jackson. I think Depp made the right choices and maintains the quirkiness and mysteriousness of Wonka, although sometimes he sounds too much like a woman, but for the most part he has a certain creepy likability that disarms that.<br/><br/>The way the factory looks inside is breathtaking. The sets are expertly done and it's eye candy: literally. Burton's artistic touch is felt all around the factory, the colors, the lighting and a look that we could have in our dreams. The movie is wondrous in it's look and creepy when the children are punished for their wrong-doings in the factory. As in the original, the children are penalized for their own misbehavior in the factory and learn their lessons for what they're doing wrong in life. Of course, there are the Oompa Loompas who have their side of the story told and that answers who's been running the factory.<br/><br/>It is a joy to see that this movie isn't just a complete remake, shot scene for scene and taken word from word. The screenplay by John August is very well constructed. This time we see Wonka's side of the story. There are flashbacks that show his childhood and what drove him to be this candy-loving loner, which are effective, revealing that little Wonka had daddy issues, on the account of his father was in the dentist profession.<br/><br/>The movie is a delight to watch, it is entertaining, sweet, stylish, funny in spots and a little creepy because just like the original we get the suspicion that Wonka is planning all of this and knows something we don't. Is it too scary for kids? I don't think so. The tone is lightened nicely by Depp's quirky performance that disarms the creepy moments into light, mild humor. Unlike the original, this movie actually has scenes of the kids leaving the factory after they've been rejected and those scenes mock the characters in the style of lightweight mockery. ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" is a nice treat of a movie. Does it live up to the original? No, but this remake is like a sweet desert that you are eagerly anticipating right after dinner. IMDb: 7. Stars: 3. Grade: B"

The sets are very imaginative as one would expect from Tim Burton.<br/><br/>The main thing this movie has going for it is that it is amusing and even funny at times, unfortunately only at times. It also tries too hard, and most of the musical numbers generally suck. The digitally cloned dwarf dancing is positively corny. Also there's something a little dark and disturbing about the Willie Wonka character that I didn't like.<br/><br/>The movie ends on a positive note- but still failed to move me very much.

"grendelkhan","7","0","1","20 May 2006"," Stands on its own merit, still prefer the original
","I'll admit upfront that I grew up with and love the original Willie Wonka. I was prepared to dismiss this film, except for two things: Tim Burton and Johnny Depp. That combination has always resulted in interesting, if not great films. I was pleasantly surprised to find the new film entertaining, though no more faithful to the source material than the original.<br/><br/>Depp is fun as the off-kilter Wonka, playing him as a wonderful eccentric, much like Ed Wood. I could have done without the ridiculous unresolved father issue (shades of Spielberg!), but it was nice to see Christopher Lee. Freddie Highmore is good as Charlie, capturing the right note of honesty and wonder. The rest of the kids are fine, but don't quite compare to the original cast. Julie Dawn Cole is still the ultimate Veruca Salt. Francesca Hunt was waisted as Mrs. Salt. Her background facial expressions were wonderful, but she should have had lines. James Fox was fine, but I miss Roy Kinnear. David Kelly was fantastic. He has been a favorite of mine since I saw him in Fawlty Towers.<br/><br/>The convention that Deep Roy is the sole Oompa-Loompa works well and he is a great performer. However, the musical pieces just don't have the same flair as the original. Oh, they're entertaining, but they lack that magical sparkle.<br/><br/>Visually, the film is a treat and the advances in effects works allow it to look better than the original, but I still felt the candy room in the original was more awe-inspiring. Here, it looked too artificial. The design was good, but it seemed a bit lifeless.<br/><br/>On the whole, the film is very entertaining, with some nice moments. The younger generation will probably have a greater love for it than people of my generation, but there is much to love for us old fogies. It lacks the charm of the original, and the sense that the unexpected could happen at any moment. Still, it looks great and keeps your attention. The performances range from adequate to great, with no real bad turns. The inclusion of Charlie's father is nice, and the squirrels are welcome. If only Burton could have spent less time focusing on the bizarre and more on the charm of the story, it would have been so much better. Roald dahl is still a tricky author to capture on screen. Kids will love the film and adults will find much to please them, as well."

","First off, you need to know that I absolutely detest musicals, and I couldn't stand the version with Gene Wilder. However, I love Johnny Depp, so I thought I'd give this film a shot. I must say I was pleasantly surprised though Johnny's impersonation of Michael Jackson was a bit eerie.<br/><br/>Charlie Bucket is poor, yet at the same time he is the richest kid in the world because he has a family who loves him. Though they have no money Charlie is a happy child. His only wish is to visit the chocolate factory where his grandpa Joe used to work, but it has been closed for the public for years. The eccentric owner Willy Wonka, played by Johnny Depp, has not been seen by anyone in the town for years.<br/><br/>Then as if someone granted his wish, Mr. Wonka writes out a contest. Five golden tickets are hidden in the Wonka bars that are sent out all over the world. Charlie has very little hopes of finding one of the golden tickets because he only gets one bar a year - for his birthday. But low and behold, Charlie manages to get two more Wonka bars this year and actually finds the last golden ticket. He takes his grandfather to the factory where they meet Willy Wonka himself. And odd things start to happen.<br/><br/>A lot of effort and energy has been put into this film. It is definitely a signature Burton film, which is a good thing in my book. Johnny Depp is fantastically eccentric and eerie, his performance is up to par as per usual. He is funny, yet at the same time he manages to give you the heebie jeebies, and on the other hand he doesn't have that hysterical thing Gene Wilder had going in the previous version. In this version I felt sorry for Willy Wonka, whereas in the 1971's version he just freaked me out.<br/><br/>The Oompa-Loompas in this version are cute, but started to annoy me when they burst into song and dance. Plus the fact that the Oompas are all played by the same actor is kind of annoying. Miss Julia Winter does an excellent job at portraying the spoiled brat Veruca Salt, and I believe we'll hear a lot from the boy who played Charlie Bucket, Freddie Highmoore, in the future.<br/><br/>Would I watch it again? Perhaps. If someone held a gun to my head. I did really enjoy it, but I just don't understand the concept of musicals. Therefore I think it'd be wise for me not to try and watch it again."

There are some good points, such as the performances of Deep Roy and David Kelly, and the occasionally fabulous CGI; but in summary the film is an over-stylised, incoherent mess.

","I saw the movie but it wasn't as good as the 1971 musical version with Gene Wilder. Even when this version has a lot of special effects in it. Also the 1971 version was more of a children's movie with all the songs in it and the simple special effect for those days used. Which I think is better understood by children than the heavy music tracks, fireworks and machine guns when they fly in the elevator used in this film. Also the fact that Johnny Depp tried to be funny in some parts of the movie when he wasn't at all. Also the story is a little bit twisted. In this film Willy's dad is a dentist??

","When I first saw that a new rendition of Willy Wonka was coming out I was somewhat hopeful for a new and improved rendition. However, I was also skeptical of how (and why) you could improve upon such a unique masterpiece as the first.<br/><br/>Finally, after months of slow somewhat conscious but mostly unconscious personal and psychological preparedness to subject myself to this unknown feature of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, I sat down just last night and viewed this improved (I assume improved being that there really should be no other reason to re-make a movie unless it is going to be just as good if not better than the original) version of Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory.<br/><br/>OK, if you haven't seen the first one you must see it. If not, then I'm sorry, because you simply won't know what you could have had in comparison.<br/><br/>First off, the character of Willy Wonka was boiled down from the dynamic and eccentric character of the original Willy Wonka, played by Gene Wilder, who was convincingly the genius behind the wonderful world of the chocolate factory, into a girlish speaking imbecile. I can't say for certain how much creative license Johnny Depp had behind the lines he spoke in the movie, but for his sake, I hope he was forced to read verbatim. The lines spoken were fully transparent and lacked the dynamic cleverness of the original. It was as though whoever it was that modified the screen play was too confused (and perhaps frightened) by the intellectual jungle gym of the original movie so it had to be watered down to something that could be more appropriately understood by a five year old. This modification in the lines spoken and the overall character of Willy Wonka was a grave injustice to the original and reduced/undermined the viability of this being an improved rendition tenfold. Lastly, never did I feel I needed a background on where the Oompa Loompas came from nor did I need to know that Willy Wonka had a troubled past that he would frequently flash back on.<br/><br/>The Oompa Loompas were a sorry mix of computer generated Brittany Spears wanna be's. Their songs were horrid pieces of writing and composition. Their clothing was comparable to anything you would find on late night video - all flash and no show. And they lacked the riddles of the original. The songs told a story, which is far better for the viewer than riddles, right? I mean, who would want to have to think through a riddle while watching a movie? WRONG. The riddles the Oompla Loompas created in their songs in the original were part of what made the movie what it was- 3 parts Gene Wilder, 3 parts Oompa Loompas, and 10 parts awesome.<br/><br/>The boat ride in the original was an event that transported you to a hypnotic realm of Gene Wilder's singing and of colors, fear, and so much else. It was a memorable moment that made up a full section of the movie in and of itself. You literally felt as though you were transported during the boat ride and the range of thought, emotion, and imagination was huge. In contrast, in this new rendition it was simply a boat cruising somewhat out of control down a chocolate river - nothing more, apart from a couple of attempts towards cleverness, one being a highly confusing riddle.... hmmm, let's think about this... a cow being whipped? What could that be? In case we didn't understand it, Charlie gave us the answer with Whipped Cream. But to elaborate, Willy Wonka had to explain that whipped cream could not be whipped cream if it had not actually been whipped. Whew, thanks, I needed that - I was really confused before the explanation. The notion of a tautological argument still confuses me. NOT. Oh wait, but I get it, it is a pun, OMG - get it? .. whipped, there is more than one way to use the term. WOW!!!<br/><br/>Lastly, Charlie never had fallen into any mischief as had happened in the original movie. Nor had Willy Wonka played the final test on Charlie.... I suppose in our society such a dynamic act and test of character is actually manipulative and dishonest and generally unliked and should have been eliminated all together, which it was. But, Willy came to terms with his troubled past and found some closure.<br/><br/>Granted, of all else that was watered down, it seemed that the whole thing was enhanced computer graphics with particular attention to lighting (wow!!! all of which was truly amazing, because that was exactly what was missing from the first. NOT.) The result of all the watering down of riddles, intellectualism, characterizations, and with the lights turned down a notch with some angles other than overhead, along with some added CG, is a horrid rendition of a movie that didn't need fixing."

","Normally I liken watching a Tim Burton movie to going to the dentist, but for the first time since ""Batman"" i was pleasantly surprised.<br/><br/>The original is legendary, so it was always going to tough work for Burton , but he did a solid job. The movie isn't an exact remake and is quite different in many regards, and surprisingly often for the better. There's a solid cast who all do a solid job. Many dedicated fans of the original were horrified when they heard Johnny Depp was playing the main role of Willy Wonka, but I feel he did a good job. It was quite a different Wonka than in the original, wisely, and Depp did a good job.<br/><br/>I wasn't a huge fan of the second half of the original as the story really wanes, and not much was done to rectify this in this remake. This is one of the few flaws of this movie. Otherwise a decent family for the whole family."

","Willy wonka, i watched the original. That was a good movie, fun for the whole family. This one did not really follow the whole original very well. Though I heard that this one follows the original book much better. Of course the songs are the best part of the whole movie. They acailly kept the original lyrics which was nice. Though the songs were quite different, one was catchy, to me. Johnney deep had a really interesting character to play, which he did pretty well. You see this movie and see the really wacky and silly comedy. I was weird though cause all the umpa loumpas all looked exactly the same. That guy really must have been like whoa, I'm everyone lol.

","I just LOVED Charlie and the Chocolate factory!!!I loved the first one.When I first saw the sneak preview on t.v. I was like,""Why is Charlie so evil?"" I didn't even know there was a book out there. So I thought everything was starting all over and Charlie was giving away the factory.(I ""believe"" in characters so I may call Depp,Willy and Freddie,Charlie, etc.) After that, I read the book and plan to read all of Dahl's.<br/><br/>Anyway,let's talk about family.Even though i'm devoted to be #1 fan, I thought there should have been more of a connection between Charlie, Grandpa Joe and his parents. It's just kinda ""okay here's his parents. They do this. Next!"" I thought Grandma Gorgina was hilarious! ""I love grapes!"" Ha!Good portraying the family. They work so well and look like a family. Beautiful.<br/><br/>Casting was excellent.The townspeople were idiots,though.Not that it matters.All the kids and parents were perfect for the part,but the moms had WAY to much make-up on.Freddie is so pure to the part.He could've been a little more outgoing as Charlie but overall:9! It's a good thing Freddie and Johnny are best friends because it's easier to portray their subtle, slow-building friendship.Everyone on and off the screen had so much playing their parts and working together,which makes the movie much more spectacular.<br/><br/>I love Johnny, and he's so perfect as Willy.No one can beat him. No one can replace him.EVER,or else.Willy Wonka does NOT look ANYTHING like M.J.!He's so cute in a vaguely creepy, insecure way. He's funny,intense,dark,passionate...everything put together! ""Bravo!Well done!Aren't they delightful?Aren't they charming?"" ""That all seemed rather rehearsed."" ""Like they knew what was going to happen."" ""Oh, poppycock!""<br/><br/>The film is SUCH an adventure. You never know what you're going to get.Especially with Tim,Johnny,and Danny(Elfman). They're so fascinating and so brilliant.<br/><br/>Flashbacks are very important to the film.The flashbacks explain that his father was ""so mean"" so he hates family and how the oompa loompas came in,etc. Without them, it wouldn't be a Tim Burton film. <br/><br/>Burton's sets are incredible!Burton wanted to keep the cast and the audience excited so it wouldn't be just one thing.He uses variety.He has passion in all of his films, and i thought this was his best, right next to ""Edward Scissorhands.""<br/><br/>Danny Elfman made the best songs for the film!I have the soundtrack, DVD, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory everything.My favorite of the soundtrack is Mike Teavee: Awesome! Very nice.<br/><br/>Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is fun for the WHOLE family. Everyone laughs through the whole film.There is comedy,adventure,and everything in between for all age groups to enjoy. This is a must see for everyone! You have got to see it! It rocks out loud!!! I love you Willy Wonka! Go Willy Wonka!"

","Tim Burton has taken something that was good, and made it brilliant. This movie is touching, funny and dark in all the right places.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp played Willy Wonka as an excitable eccentric adorned with a superbly styled bob cut which made him every bit more weird. The children were all as horrid as ever (Charlie being the exception of course) and the parents of the brats were played extremely well as pushy, eager people who each want their ""lovely"" child to win the lifetime supply of chocolate. Deep Roy created a fresh new face for the oompa loompas and was delightful. The new oompa loompa songs are fantastic and I found myself bopping along to all of them, particularly Violet Beauregarde's song.<br/><br/>""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" is branded with Tim Burton's Gothic/fantasy world feel as are most of his films. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and it's beautiful colours, sets, music and wonderful actors. I would strongly recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys a slightly dark comedy that still has it's share of laugh out loud moments."

","Oompa Loompa Loompa Di Du.. OK, I will fall short from singing the infamous catchy tune from the celebrated children's classic film ""Willie Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"". Unfortunately, the song was not included in the Willy Wonka remake ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"". That is not the only reason why ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" was not able to surpass its predecessor. For those of you who are not familiar of the chocolate dark side of this sweet fable, here it is: Charlie Bucket is a sweet destitute boy who gets a golden ticket in his Willy Wonka chocolate bar which enables to him to get invited to the mesmeric Willy Wonka Chocolate Factory. He takes his granddaddy along and encounters other golden ticket raffle-winning children who are definitely not a bunch of sweet vanillas. Wonka himself is an eccentric who probably had too many nuts in his ice cream as a child. Johnny Depp stars as Wonka; it is wilder than the original Gene Wilder ""Wonka"" performance. However, wilder does not necessarily signify better. Even though Depp was ""depplicious"" at times with his nifty verbose, it still did not satisfy my taste buds because of the unnecessary slapstick that was instilled in his character. Director Tim Burton does create a compelling Wonka World but he did have his ""rocky road"" in direction by sinking too much into Wonka's mundane childhood. Child actor Freddie Highmore was able to find neverland in his affecting performance in ""Finding Neverland"", but he did not exactly melt me with his inflated ""Charlie Angel"" effort. The rest of the cast: David Kelly as Grandpa Joe, Noah Taylor & Helena Bonham Carter as Mr. & Mrs. Bucket, and Christopher Lee as Dr. Wonka was not the supporting acting dessert I was craving for. ""Charlie and The Chocolate Factory"" is not exactly a ""bucket"" of . , but I would also not spend too much golden money to get a golden ticket to see it. *** Average"
"craeiattan","5","0","1","31 March 2006"," Disappointing adaptation of Dahl's classic
","As a movie per se, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is commendable, replete with the quintessential Burtonesque visual richness and imagery, as well as Danny Elfman's music. As an adaptation of the book, it was lacklustre; this is my personal opinion - others may not have minded the distortion of the original novel in the film - but I was sorely disappointed with this Burton-Elfman collaboration, which was nowhere as good as Nightmare Before Christmas, or even Corpse Bride.<br/><br/>The side plot of Wonka's family background is never in the original book, and adding it to the movie seems to have little relevance, apart from explaining Wonka's eccentricity and lack of self-esteem, and for greater effect in the family reunion ending of the film. It detracted from the main storyline and that reel time could've been better spent on more stunning vistas of Wonka's amazing factory.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp was, intentionally or not, a hideous travesty of the Wonka we all loved as kids. Willy Wonka is enigmatic, dotty, yes, but he is also intelligent and funny! He is NOT the blundering, stuttering effeminate and neurotic man in the movie. Moreover, his Oompa Loompas were hideous; I mean, ugh, those garish leather suits and oily slicked hair. They weren't lovely and funny as the book suggests - laughs from the antics of the Oompa Loompas were few and forced. I was hoping that Burton would capture the scene of happy Oompa Loompa families as depicted in the novel too. The songs were creative, but amidst the cacophony, they were barely decipherable and that's a shame. The music, whilst commendable, was pedestrian in some parts and definitely not Elfman's best (such as those in Nightmare).<br/><br/>These were my major bugbears, but they detracted so much from the movie that I didn't really enjoy it as much as I'd have liked to. Again, how much you enjoy this movie will depend on whether or not you have read the original classic (but you must have already, right? How can you not have read Dahl!) and how much of a purist you are."

","My friend was the first one to see Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, and from what she had told me, it wasn't very good. But I wanted to see it for myself... and I have to admilt, at first, I thought it was the dumbest movie ever. I could've started an ""I hate CATCF"" club... here's a little advice for first time viewers of this movie: if you didn't like it the first time, see it again. It was so much better the second time I saw it. I never would've thought it would be my favorite movie, and now I'm completely obsessed with it.<br/><br/>Shortly after I saw it for the second time, I read the origianal book by Roald Dahl, and CATCF if definitely true to the book. Especially the Oompa-Loompa songs that were actually from the little poems Oompa-Loompas say in the book.<br/><br/>Another thing that makes this movie so great is the acting. Willy Wonka just wouldn't be Willy Wonka if it weren't Johnny Depp weren't playing him. He is absolutely perfect for the role. Some people who think Willy Wonka should be more father-like should read the book... the Willy Wonka in the Roald Dahl book is very quirky and weird as well, which is another reason this movie is so true to the book.<br/><br/>The music by Danny Elfman is great, and fun to sing along with. Nothing could be better.<br/><br/>The only thing that bothers me is the Oompa-Loompas, but you have to admit, they're just hilarious."
"mike_sandiego","10","0","3","24 March 2006"," Finally a version of Charlie & the Chocolate that is true to the book!
","I had no doubt when I heard about Tim Burton making his own version of Charlie & the Chocolate Factory, that it would be wondrous, as well as a little on the dark side. After reading the book when I was in 4th grade and being infatuated with the story, as well as the quirky way Roald Dahl tells a story, I found myself disappointed in the first movie, ""Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory,"" with Gene Wilder. It was toned down quite a bit from the book, and having also a musical made me cringe.<br/><br/>This new version shows not only the connection between Willy Wonka and Charlie Bucket, but also shows just how strange Willy Wonka was portrayed in the book. No one else but Johnny Depp could have done such a wonderful adaptation of the character. Let's face it, he was bottled up in that factory for 15 years living with no one else but Oompa-Loompas, and that alone would make anyone a little strange. Mr. Depp showed him as wary of adults, as well as children who would not understand his genius mind. An eccentric as he was in the book made his taste for clothes very lavish, and his being cut off from the world for so long made him think that his hairstyle was ""cool!"" Yet Johnny Depp was able to also portray a caring side of Willy Wonka, wanting to find an heir to take over and take care of his precious Oompa Loompas, and continue his work. And being able to find a family he could love and be loved by.<br/><br/>People shouldn't compare the two movies in any way. This is not a remake of the original, but a ""TRUE ORIGINAL."" The sets are wondrous, the casting superb, and the adaptation of the story even more fun! Thank you Johnny Depp, Tim Burton and Danny Elfman for a fun filled, quirky, ride with twists and turns that only a reader of the original book could enjoy."

","As for someone whose memory of the book and original film are so far back as to be dust, I thoroughly enjoyed Tim Burton's creation. As a fan of his earlier work (Edward Scissorhands, Nightmare Before Christmas), I am not at all surprised at the production value and beauty of the movie. As most everyone already knows the premise, the brief outline is that rich hermit Willy Wonka decides to allow five children to visit him in his factory for one full day, with one child winning a special prize. To select the winners, he hides five golden tickets in five bars of chocolate which are sent out across the world. Each child that finds a golden ticket represents a different vice, from Violet to Augustus to Charlie, who is the only one that has a genuine heart. The acting is strong across the board, the Oompa Loompas delightful (all fx'd in multiple by Deep Roy), though the background story of Willy and his father make this otherwise children's film more adult."

","This is the second time I've seen this movie, and I enjoyed it just as much as my first viewing. I wont say if I thought it was better or worse than the original, as it was an entirely different movie, and largely incomparable to the 1971 film. Depp was great as always, his Wonka was so crazy that it was almost scary in some parts. The supporting cast was great as well, including many Burton regulars such as Helena Bonham Carter, and Deep Roy as the bizarre new Oomp-Loompas. Christopher Lee makes a nice appearance as Wonka's dentist father. Lee never disappoints, and while his part is rather small, it is one of the highlights of the movie in my opinion.

The oompa's seem less frightening and their riddled songs are less punishing. Err is to be human.<br/><br/>Unlike the God complex of Willy Wonka, Charlie and The Chocolate factory aims more for the effects of an oppressive childhood. Depp's resemblance to Michael Jackson is too coincidental for it to be a Make Up Artist's inspiration. Willy is a good guy and unconventional, living a reclusive life within a wondrous and magical Chocolate Factory. He learned the art of entrepreneurship and grew wealthy as he mentally remained a child. Oh those youthful pains that plague the soul for eternity. Like trick or treating we must learn to get over it and lean to your family who have always known your child spirit, to remind you to get over it.<br/><br/>Charlie is the key to freeing Wonka's inner child and stepping outside the box.

"stiv-7","9","0","3","1 March 2006"," I had my doubts, but...
","Tim Burton has absolutely nailed this film. Granted, he does add a subplot that was not in the novel, but I was amazed by how closely he stuck to the book with this latest adaptation. Some big changes were made from the 1971 film, but the vast majority of them were in the book to begin with. I was particularly tickled with the inclusion of the Prince Pondicherry story.<br/><br/>The verdict on Depp as Wonka? It gets better with repeat viewings. The reports of his character being based on Michael Jackson simply don't ring true, as he comes across more as a children's show host with a sadistic streak.<br/><br/>Probably the most substantial difference between this film and 1971's Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory is the focus, which is rightfully returned to Charlie Bucket. Charlie has more depth in this film and gives you more reason to root for him. Peter Ostrum was fine in 1971, but was constrained by the limits of the script. Freddie Highmore does much better, but largely because he's given more to do. The rest of the cast is spot-on as well, and the family dynamic (largely absent from WW&TCF) gives this film an altogether different dimension.<br/><br/>In short, I really liked the 1971 film, and it's still difficult to choose between the two, but I have to give the edge to Charlie, largely because it hews more closely to how I imagined the book when I read it as a child."
"bluedragonfood","8","0","1","18 February 2006"," My childhood has come back.
","Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is by far one of the best adaptations of a book I've ever seen. And who better to put together than Roald Dahl and Tim Burton? No one, really.<br/><br/>THough the 70's version, ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory,"" is regarded as a classic, it simply did not do the book any justice. My dad raised me on Roald Dahl (and Beatrix Potter), and those children's tales are timeless. The trouble is that most attempts a film versions of Dahl's work have been disappointing at best (Matilda would be a good example here). They simply don't capture the fun part of the magic that Dahl put in his books.<br/><br/>""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" has corrected that history of error by being an outstanding work of genius. Tim Burton's inclusion of even the tiniest of details makes the movie shine, such as Dahl's original Oompah Loompah song lyrics (highly abridged, though still much better than that weird chant from the 70's version), and the inclusion of his ""whipped cream"" room (but can anyone explain the pink sheep part?). This one also captured the characters much better than the 70's version. Gene Wilder made Wonka out to be a hermit-like wizard who had no connection with children, and was as stiff and stern as a rail. Johnny Depp's portrayal of the character was much truer. Willy Wonka is supposed to be a little off his rocker, and Depp personifies that perfectly.<br/><br/>Yet for all this wonderful creation, Tim Burton has still managed to smudge the original story. Whether by his own devices or some obligation, the screenplay strays from the original book. It has mostly to do with Charlie helping Wanka re-awaken memories of his childhood, and his cold-hearted father (brilliantly played by Christopher Lee) that he has long suppressed. But it also made the same mistake as it's predecessor by extending the story. The books ends right as they crash through the roof of the factory, which sets up for the sequel, ""Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator,"" an entirely ridiculous book which has our heroes mercilessly suspended in orbit around the Earth for the majority of the story. Of course, I understand why it's more logical in a film sense to find a suitable, sequel-free ending, but part of me wishes that there would be a film about Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator. The second foul-up on film's part is the actual physical appearance of Mr. Wonka. He is quite clearly described in the book as a strange little man with a goatee. Neither film version has Wonka as either short or bearded. This is easily overlooked, but still distracting if you think about it too much.<br/><br/>All in all, this movie is incredible, and it will remain a timeless classic for quite a long time."

I have to say that the most memorable aspect of this film, as with many other moviegoers are going to say, is Johnny Depp's character. His Willy Wonka is eccentric, creepy, and a social misfit. Depp gives another memorable performance as with his Jack Sparrow in Pirates of the Caribbean. Tim Burton has created a great fantasy film with great performances with its cast.

"morphion2","9","0","2","15 February 2006"," Definitely New and Improved
","When you think of the magical, the fantastic, the imaginative, one name consistently comes to mind: Tim Burton. The man has made a career out of directing fun-loving fairy tales of many sub-genres, his most famous of course being the surreal ""Edward Scissorhands"", which, as everyone knows, featured long time collaborator Johnny Depp. In 2005, Depp and Burton team up yet again, this time for an adaptation of the Roald Dahl children's classic ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"".<br/><br/>Everybody knows the story: a famous, fictional candy factory, run by mysterious and eccentric ""chocolatier"" Willy Wonka (Depp) and renown for producing magical confectionery, unexpectedly announces that hidden in ordinary Wonka chocolate bars are exactly five golden tickets, each of which guarantees an all day tour in the long-secluded factory. The five ticket finders are all children, all but one of which harbor some horrible characteristic; Augustus Gloop (Philip Wiegratz), the greedy, gluttonous German boy, Violet Beauregarde (AnnaSophia Robb), the aggressive and competitive gum-chewing girl, Veruca Salt (Julia Winter), the obnoxious and spoilt brat, Mike TeaVee (Jordan Fry) a television-obsessed and revoltingly sarcastic little know-it-all, and lastly Charlie Bucket (Freddie Highmore), the little English boy who lives in poverty and is the only decent ticket-holder amongst them. When all five of the children, accompanied by one parent each, actually enter the revered chocolate factory, however, the fantastical and bizarre experiences therein give them much more than they bargained for.<br/><br/>The original film adaptation of Dahl's book, Mel Stuart's ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"" starring Gene Wilder, has undoubtedly set a precedent by which many fans will judge and perhaps condemn Burton's version, but there's no denying that the original was an infinitely softer interpretation of the story. This remake, while having changed a few things here and there, has what one can't help but call a delightfully sinister undertone, enhanced in no small measure by Danny Elfman's exciting score, and essentially makes it a lot closer to being a traditional Roald Dahl tale than Mel Stuart's version.<br/><br/>The reason for this is that Dahl's style, while never varying from children's stories, would always balance somewhat on the edge of maliciousness; he was prone to premises that somehow involved slightly sadistic, even if inadvertently so, punishment of young children, such as the abusive aunts in ""James and the Giant Peach"", or the recollection of his school-day beatings in his autobiography ""Boy"". Nonetheless, his stories were never truly disturbing or horrifying, because they interspersed the darkness with its equally fantastic antithesis and always resolved happily. Luckily ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" remains true to Dahl in this regard as well; even if somewhat perturbing, there is tremendous amounts of fun to be had along the way.<br/><br/>The enjoyment seems to be mutual between viewers and makers; not only has Tim Burton obviously had a ball with making this colorful candy film, but Johnny Depp seems to be thoroughly enjoying himself too. Almost unrecognizable in appearance and voice, Depp's interpretation of Willy Wonka is both very different from Gene Wilder's and unlike anything he's ever done before (if drawing rather obviously on Michael Jackson). He really brings out the eccentricity in the character, accentuating his anti-social genius mentality and throwing in a missing father complex to accompany the film's B-story about Wonka's dentist papa. If for no other reason than he thought it might be fun, Depp's performance is one of the most interesting things about this tasty treat of a film.<br/><br/>The children, its worth noting, also give very sweet performances; Freddie Highmore, having worked with Depp previously on ""Finding Neverland"", captures a caring innocence that even the original didn't match, although perhaps this has something to do with the omitting of the famous ""soda scene"". For the other children, what impresses most is their willingness to simply be horrible; an aspect of acting that is second nature to adults but implies a professional maturity when found in actors so young, mainly because in doing so they perpetuate stereotypes at their own expense. Jordan Fry and AnnaSophia Robb, particularly, are very convincing in their respective roles (see if you can spot Robb in her many upcoming projects; the young lady looks very different without her blonde bowl-cut and blue jumpsuit).<br/><br/>Perhaps the idealistic wonder of ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" that was present in the 70's version is subdued by the subtle darkness that comes with Burton's vision; but all round this is still a creative, faithful and most importantly enjoyable adaptation of an iconic classic. A colorful film that brims with all-age enjoyment and truly deserves the title of rewarding, family fun."

","Charlie and the Chocolate Factory was my favorite book as a child. I've probably read it a million times, and I still love it with all my heart. Roald Dahl is my all-time favorite author for his amazing imagination and wonderful books. When I first heard that Tim Burton (one of my favorite directors ever) was directing the newest movie version, I literally was ecstatic.<br/><br/>I am being very honest by saying that I absolutely, 100%, hated the 1st version. First off, it didn't even have the right name. The book title starts out with Charlie, not Willy Wonka. Also, I was shocked at how different the movie was to the book. Of course, the director would add and change things to make the movie more interesting, but at least don't change the major points. But probably the part I hated the most was the Oompa Loompas. Really, anyone who has read the book knows that the Oompa Loompas look like regular people, just a lot shorter and smaller. These ""creatures"" had green hair and orange skin. It's utterly amazing how scary they looked.<br/><br/>So, enough about the 1st version. I have been told my the majority of my friend who have watched both versions that they liked the 1st one better. I must admit, I was disappointed that Tim Burton had to add the part about Wonka's father and how Willy Wonka's factory came to be. The original story is a great one, but the added history with Willy and his father was very well thought out, and I think that Tim Burton picked the perfect person to play Wilbur Wonka.<br/><br/>Right now, my biggest fear concerning this movie is that someone (hopefully not Tim Burton) will make a HUGE mistake and start working on a sequel to this movie. I loved the 1st book, but the second one (Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator) was the biggest mistake Dahl made. I really think that CATCF would have been such a better book without the sequel, but CATCF as a movie will be 10 times better without a follow-up. So to all you movie directors out there, if you're reading this, don't spoil a perfectly good movie. Leave it alone."
"jamespcool_2k","9","0","3","19 January 2006"," Fantastic remake
","After a simply super Spring of Star Wars, Sin City and umm... Batman, I must confess that I feared the subsequent season would be unable to compete. And I feared I might be right until Tim Burton teamed up with Johnny Depp (who else!) to produce summerthing really special - a deliciously dark big screen remake of Roald Dahl's Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.<br/><br/>The tale is centred around Willy Wonka's mysterious chocolate factory which nobody has entered for years and which appear for all the world to be deserted. ""The only thing that comes out of that place is the candy"". That is until Mr Wonka decides he needs an heir and so opens his legendary doors for five lucky children. All the children are fantastically well acted given the tender years of the performers and 12-year-old Freddie Highmore, in particular, gives a superbly accomplished performance as young Charlie. But as heart-warming as Charlie's innate goodness is, and as amusing as Augustus Gloop's innate German-ness is; the real star of this show is Johnny Depp as the simultaneously creepy, hilarious, pitiful and peculiar Willy Wonka.<br/><br/>One of the reasons he is Hollywood's hottest property is the deppth and versatility of his acting. He can change effortlessly from a swashbuckling rogue in 'Pirates of the Caribbean', a drug-dealing family man in 'Blow' and now this oddball chocolatier. There is more than a hint of Wacko Jacko about his childlike performance with that familiar nervous giggle and aura of naivety. Most of the film's comedy comes through him, and I often found myself chockling at lines like ""Everything in this room is edible. Even I'm edible. But that is called cannibalism, my dear children, and is in fact frowned upon in most societies."" And so on to the inevitable comparisons with the 1971 original. For me, Johnny Depp easily outstrips Gene Wilder in the lead role and screenwriter John August doesn't fall in to the trap of attempting to simply replicate the original. The addition of flashbacks to Wonka's troubled childhood is simply genius and as a whole, this 2005 version is without doubt new and improved. The visual effects and fine performances make for an almost flawless film with only two weaknesses. Firstly, the modern oompah loompahs just lacked the creepy humour of the old ones. But most importantly, Augustus Gloop did not get a large enough role  greedy, overweight Germans make good viewing!"
"Rich B","7","0","1","29 January 2006"," A strong revisitation of the classic, although quirkier and slightly updated.
","The original Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory with Gene Wilder in the lead is somewhat of a classic for many people, and much like with The Planet of the Apes, I just didn't think it should be remade, or indeed could be.<br/><br/>Yet in this version the story is very close to the original and only deviates in some places.There's the same degree of oddness as well as good fun but also there's an added adult level to play to which is rather quite effective.<br/><br/>The whole movie proves to be very close to the original except for the ending which takes the story in a new and altogether well fitting direction.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp is surprisingly good as Wonka. I have to say that when I first saw and heard him in character I made a mental comparison to Wilder and rejected him immediately. Yet during the film he managed to pull the character off really well portraying stupidity alongside a calculating, almost malevolent quality. He certainly has captured a completely quirky and non-grown up persona.<br/><br/>Freddie Highmore is also very good, not being too sickly sweet but capturing that childhood innocence very well. The other children stand strong alongside him, but none truly shine.<br/><br/>One of the notable things about the movie is the addition of a new family and Golden Ticket winner, the TV family. To modernise the movie the child is a mind of information and has assembled it all through watching TV and also playing videogames. It's slightly twee in the concept, but it works well.<br/><br/>Although there are these tweaks and updates to the story, it's not harmed the movie any and still retains a lot of the feel of the original. You feel the emotion when Charlie shares his Birthday chocolate bar with his family or when he finally finds the Golden Ticket, or even when Wonka meets his Father against and we understand some of his quirks.<br/><br/>Tim Burton has done a good job and given us a very entertaining family film and pulled another excellent performance from Depp. A very good revisitation of the story, surely set to be the replacement on the Christmas TV list."
"pinbyte","6","0","3","22 January 2006"," Entertaining, but certainly no classic like 1971 version
","First let me say I don't care which movie version is closer to the book. I am interested in the movie itself. This new version, taken by itself, is pretty good entertainment.<br/><br/>Burton provides a well put together piece of eye candy, let there be no doubt. I found Depp's off-the-wall portrayal of WW quite fun to watch. I was not as impressed with the music as so many are. It was okay, but I found the words in the musical numbers hard to understand.<br/><br/>As for the storyline, anybody over 10 years old already knows its a great story. So this movie obviously has that going for it... so a 6/10 rating is warranted for this movie on it's own. However, it will never be the classic like the 1971 version.<br/><br/>Now is the time where I draw a few comparisons with 1971's ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"". The following may contain SPOILERS.<br/><br/>When compared with the 1971 version, the 2005 version pales. The adaptation of the story did not offer much complexity or richness. For example, the 1971 version goes out of its way to show the greed of the children. It uses the Slugworth sub-plot to illustrate this.<br/><br/>Charlie does not inherit the factory just because he is the last one standing as in the 2005 version. He proves himself by being the only child with integrity. The 1971 version teaches a lesson of decency that is all but lost in the 2005 version.<br/><br/>In the creativity department, the 2005 version also pales. With today's CGI, they could have really had some fun. For example, the coat room scene in 1971 has a bunch of hands mounted on the wall which grab your coat.<br/><br/>In 2005, the coats are just dropped on the floor and that's that. I was really expecting hands to come out of mid-air and pick up the coats, keeping them eerily suspended. It would have been great, and still fit in with the dark and creepy Tim Burton style.<br/><br/>As for the musical numbers, the 2005 version offers far fewer, and none as entertaining as the 1971 version. Both try to teach a lesson as each child succumbs to his or her failings. Only the 1971 version succeeds. The 1971 version also features a fabulous solo by Veruca as she adamantly exclaims ""I want it now"" in song. No such numbers in 2005.<br/><br/>I could go on indefinitely as to why the 1971 version was far superior to 2005, but this review is about the 2005 version. One just cannot help comparing the two. I think those who see both should view them as two completely different movies based on the same story.<br/><br/>In my opinion, the 2005 version is just a good movie but the 1971 version is a true classic. It will continue to stand the test of time as the 2005 version fades away."
"cwrdlylyn","7","0","2","15 January 2006"," CHARLIE & THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY : Might Not Be Gene Wilder, But Still Lots Of Fun...
","CHARLIE & THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY <br/><br/>The main thing I admired about this version of Roald Dahl's classic is that it clearly set out to find it's own visual style and overall tone when compared to the classic '72 Gene Wilder version. Tim Burton creates an ambiguously surreal world for young Charlie (Freddie Highmore), the young boy who visits Willy Wonka's famous chocolate factory. This skewed reality allows Burton to create captivating visuals in every situation, whether it is in the grand scale candy room and chocolate river... or whether it is the mere visualization of Augustus Gloop's obsessive chocolate intake.<br/><br/>Everything in the film is stylized, and I loved that aspect. Every child has one element that is played up to a much more dramatic extreme in this one versus the original... and it works. The children are honestly the best part of the film. The performances aren't as nuanced or natural as those of the original children... but they are more distinctly defined. These children obviously all went over the top to play to their stereotypes, but they all kept it natural and fluid enough that I never lost interest. This might be the finest ensemble of child actors I have seen in a long while. I loved every one of the kids in this version more so than in the original.<br/><br/>However, some elements Burton seemed to add to differentiate his film, though admirable, just don't managed to be as good as they once were. The oompa-loompas are nothing short of incredibly disappointing. Their songs lack the humor and straightforwardness... lyrics are barely understandable... and there is so much action going on that any element of humor in these songs is impossible to catch. Also, the demise of some of the children is made too grand. Violet turning into a blueberry used to be the simple image of a young girl waddling about, and it was hysterical... here, the computer imagery and confusion with the Oompaloompas is just a bit too much.<br/><br/>The only other major flaw of the film is an incredibly mediocre and disappointing performance from Depp. From the previews I thought his interpretation would make me mad the entire time... it didn't. I bought into his approach and went with it, but I was never won over. Gene Wilder managed to make Willy Wonka the comedic center-point of the film... always holding the audience's attention in the palm of his hand. Depp just kind of blends into the visual spectacle that surrounds him and gets lost. Whenever the film tried to focus on his character (with that insufferable back story with his father... this part just dragged the movie to a screeching halt any time it came up) I was simply wishing for more of the children.<br/><br/>Overall, although their were disappointing moments... on a whole the film had me completely interested. I loved the kids, and thankfully they are the focus of most of the picture. Tim Burton's visuals were beautiful and unique... and the movie constantly supplies it's audience with a fun/harmless/visual treat.<br/><br/>WILLY WONKA & THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY will for me be the classic version of the Roald Dahl book forever... however the new CHARLIE & THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY deserves it's own viewing, and it's own fan base. It's simple minded fun with enough going on to keep any audience interested. Just don't expect the perfection of the original.<br/><br/>... B- ...<br/><br/>PS - The film gets bonus points for showing what happened to the kids once they left the factory. This was one of my favorite moments."
"dfranzen70","7","0","1","6 January 2006"," Only slightly spoiled chocolate won't melt your heart
","Amazing sets and catchy tunes aside, this remake of the 1971 original suffers a bit from an intentionally effected performance by Johnny Depp as Willy Wonka but is buoyed tremendously by Freddie Highmore, playing Charlie Bucket. Whimsical and highly imaginative, Tim Burton's latest melange of creativity is wholesome without being entirely pure, although the edge of the original film (and Roald Dahl's story) is somewhat blunted.<br/><br/>Wonka's world-famous candy factory has been closed to the public - anyone, really - for decades, although candy still emerges each morning, neatly packed and ready to ship. Then one day, Wonka himself announces he has placed Golden Tickets in five Wonka Bars distributed throughout the globe. The children who find the five tickets are thereupon invited to a Grand Tour of the mysterious factory, and one of the kids will get a Veddy Special Prize at the end.<br/><br/>The kids are the same as in the first film: snotty spoiled brat Veruca Salt, overachiever Violet Beauregarde, glutton Augustus Gloop, hostile Mike Teavee, and waiflike Charlie Bucket. Throughout the tour, each exposes his or her own self as a greedy, conniving fiend - except, of course, for poor (literally) Charlie, who's accompanied by his superold grandpa (David Kelly, who's fantastic).<br/><br/>The sets are stunning, from the chocolate river to the squirrels' QC lab, and this allows one to forget how annoying Depp's Wonka is. He's intentionally unique, which is sort of a euphemism for ""we want him to be as strange as possible, the better to distance him from the people from the outside world."" Some have said that Depp was consciously aping Michael Jackson in his mannerisms, but I don't really see it. Heck, his Wonka doesn't even like kids, and he detests any kind of familial arrangement. I admire Depp for trying to make the role his own (and thus differentiating his work from that of Gene Wilder), but his Wonka was a little too loopy for me - it was tough to get a handle on him. And when you did think you knew what he was about, he'd say something that disproved that; sometimes that seemed to be a heavyhanded approach, a way to cynically manipulate the audience. If it was supposed to keep us on our toes, it failed, because I got tired of the character's contrarian attitude.<br/><br/>A real treat, added just for the movie, is Wonka's father, played by the estimable Christopher Lee. The senior Wonka is a dentist (of course he is) who has not seen his only son since the latter left home to become a chocolatier. Which brings up an interesting question. How come Dr. Wonka looks older when he reunites with Willy than when they're together in flashbacks... but Willy doesn't? In fact, Willy Wonka looks pretty young - Lee looks more like his grandfather. Depp still has quite the boyish look about him; he appears to be in his late twenties, possible midthirties.<br/><br/>I also enjoyed the Oompa Loompas, played by exactly one guy - Deep Roy. Roy repeated the movements of the Oompa Loompahs hundreds of times, and then he was digitally repeated over and over again, creating the illusion that he was many instead of one. A fine, fun job.<br/><br/>Highmore is a truly great find; he played Peter in Finding Neverland, also starring Depp. Depp recommended Highmore to Tim Burton for the role of the angelic Charlie, and it turned out to be a most excellent recommendation. Charlie is alternately sage and blissfully naive, wise beyond his few years but still innocent at heart.<br/><br/>Charlie and the Chocolate Factory isn't as meanspirited as its predecessor, but it does have better scenery and fine performances - even the kids, so horribly bratty in the original, are merely rotten in this one. Burton proves again he has the visual part of directing down pat, although sometimes the heart eludes him."

","I don't normally like Tim Burton movies because he tends to go over the top with too much fantastical crap. But this movie was surprisingly un-tacky, and like most good children's movies it worked on several levels. The only flaw were the singing and dancing scenes with the Oompa-Loompas, which got a bit boring after the third time. The set design was stylish and some parts of the films were quite sick to watch even for adults. The funniest moment most have been the close-up of the killer squirrel. Oh, and is it just me and my dirty mind, or was there a big fetish thing going on with the latex gloves, the shiny and brightly-coloured suits, the hairdressers' and dentists' chairs and what have you? Unbelievable how much sex Tim Burton has managed to conceal in a children's film. Tss. tss."

","I just finished Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and was very impressed. Burton dazzles us with startling imagery and a perfect modern recreation of what we all envision the towering Wonka factory to be. Though Johnny Depp hasn't always impressed me, his quirkiness plays a vital role to bringing the ever-so disturbing character of Willy Wonka to our hearts. We see very quickly how much this movie differs from the original, in some distinct ways. Parts of the setting has been modernized, and is a very interesting mix between times and generations. Also, we see some background to Willy Wonka and explanations to why exactly he is the marvel he is. This movie for every sense was beautiful and stunning. Burton really hands us a treat with this one, and we should treasure it like a tiny morsel of creamy chocolate melting in the mouth. The reasons this movie is not a 9/10 or a 10/10 starts with the oompa loompas. While often funny and strange, the original orange and green oompa loompas served the setting much better. Everything is so colorful in the Wonka factory, why not the oompas? Also, they tried way to hard on the songs and just seem to come out over-the-top and not with the power held by the original's. Also, I would have liked to see Charlie's character have a larger role in the picture. They have reduced his role in the story to give Wonka a bit more depth, which in my opinion hurts the final 20 minutes of the story and impact that it is supposed to serve. Overall this a great movie though and I would recommend it to anybody. If you've never experienced Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, get ready for visuals the will spark your inner child and definitely an in-Depp spin on Willy Wonka and his amazing factory. 7/10"

"StainGirlLives","7","0","2","5 January 2006"," A bit disappointing, but not too bad either
","The story 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory' is originally by Roald Dahl, a man with a giant dose of fantasy, and just like Tim Burton, a (sometimes) morbid kind of humour. This story is about little and poor Charlie Bucket, who magically finds a Golden Ticket in the wrapping of a Willy Wonka's chocolate bar. This ticket gives him the opportunity to visit Willy Wonka's chocolate factory, a place where no one has come in or out for many, many years. Together with his grandfather Jacob, and the finders of the four other Golden Tickets, he enters the magical world of Willy Wonka. Many surprises await him, including a big prize.<br/><br/>Tim Burton is my favourite director, and Roald Dahl is my favourite writer, so I had high expectations of this movie. But I'm a bit disappointed. And I blame John August, who wrote the screenplay. I don't really mind that they change the story a bit, but only if it is for the better. On the one hand they spiced it up a little, by making Willy Wonka (Johnny Depp) weirder than ever, by making the kids and parents (except Charlie) more obnoxious, putting the Oompa-Loompas in latex suits with vivid colours, giving it all a sharper edge I had no problems with that. That they gave Wily Wonka a past, and a father, well  OK. But it also took the myth and the mystery around Willy Wonka away (he could have at least come from another planet) But what I really, really disliked about this adaptation is that they also sweetened it up  a lot. First of all, Charlie is said to be a normal kid, but he isn't: he is so sweet and so moralistic that he is everything but normal. Second, and worst, they created a whole new ending telling us how important family is, showing Willy Wonka as a poor traumatised man. Roald Dahl's version of the story is already rather moralistic, by telling us it is bad for kids to watch too much TV, to be spoiled by their parents, to eat too much candy, to constantly chew gum, That family is important, is present in the book too, just by showing how close Charlie's family is, but why, oh why did they have to exaggerate on this aspect in the movie? By changing the story, by spicing and sweetening it up at the same time, you get a confusing mix of craziness and morals, of fun and seriousness. Because it constantly changes it is impossible to get completely sucked into the atmosphere, like I usually experience when watching Burton-films. One moment it's all sparkling crazy fun, the next moment we go back to Willy Wonka's traumatic youth, this breaks the tempo of the wild ride on the great chocolate river.<br/><br/>Besides this, there's absolutely nothing wrong with this movie, on the contrary. Visually, this is a real Burton film, except that it is more colourful (most of the time) than most of his oeuvre. The scenery looks magical (I especially loved the little house the Bucket family lives in). Another thing that was typically Tim Burton is that everything is a bit weirder than it already was in the Roald Dahl story. Everything and everybody looks and acts very surreal. First of all it is rather weird that all the Oompa-Loompas are all played by Deep Roy, and consequently all look the same. (Female Oompa-Loompas are also Deep Roy, but dressed in women's clothes) As I already said, Willy Wonka is weirder than ever. I've never seen Johnny Depp so crazy, and that is saying something. The kids are just as surreal as Willy Wonka, the movie makers even added some obnoxious habits to the kids' characters. The young actors, picked out to portray them, are absolutely great.<br/><br/>Danny Elfman had lots of fun composing the music for the Oompa-Loompa songs that go with Roald Dahl's lyrics, and I had lots of fun listening to them, and watching the crazy dances of the Oompa-Loompas while singing. He chose a different style for every song (Broadway, 70's, rock, ) and Tim Burton added a matching dance for each one.<br/><br/>The movie is lots of fun, it's like watching the craziest and weirdest circus show, suffused with beautiful visuals. If it wasn't for the spoiled story this would have been a definite four star movie, maybe even five. It makes me almost angry knowing how magnificent this movie could have been, why didn't they just stick to the fun stuff?"

","I wrote another comment on this and only gave it a 3. But I didn't feel that I judged it fairly since I watched it late at night half asleep with the sound so low that I could barely hear it because I didn't want to wake anyone up. So I watched it again the next day with the sound all the way up and came away with much more appreciation for this remake. I actually like this one better than the old one. At first I liked the ending of the old one better but after the second viewing of the new one I actually like it quite a bit more. It had more closure and quite a bit more to it. I also like the special effects which will make it a far more appealing movie to todays youth as well. And some of the situations were updated that make it fit todays society a lot better. I like the role Depp had more than the older role for Gene because Depps role was a little more bizarre, weird, and just plain nutty and he pulled it of very well. I think a lot of people that give this a low rating do so like I did. Their first reaction is negative because they liked the original so much and it is like changing part of your own childhood. But once you step back and look at this movie for what it is you come away with a real appreciation for it."

I liked many aspects of the new version better than the original, (the flow of the story, the more three dimensional portrayal of Charlie and his family, no dreadful 'Cheer up Charlie' musical interludes) but I felt the Depp Wonka lacked the twisted humor and mystery of Wilder's Wonka. <br/><br/>Wilder's Wonka was strange, offbeat, and bizarre but, in the grand scheme of things, with a purpose. The Burton/Depp Wonka is strange, offbeat (but more in an uncomfortable not particularly funny way),weird, and emotionally stunted man.

Johnny Depp's bizarre performance as Willy Wonka is definitely the best thing about this movie... just as Gene Wilder was the best thing about the original ""Wonka"". I was a bit puzzled as to why they decided not to use the original songs from the first movie... but then they went ahead and created new songs for the Oompa-Loompas anyway... I guess it was cheaper to make up new songs than to pay the original composer for the rights to re-record them. I like the character of Charlie more in this new version that the annoying little goody-goody in the first movie... but I think I prefer Jack Albertson as the original grandpa. The storyline basically is the same as the earlier flick... except for the conclusion (I'm not sure which ending is closer to what was written in Roald Dahl's novel... I guess I'll have to read it one day). I was a bit dismayed by the fact that the greedy, nasty kids in this movie don't seem to learn a lesson from their harrowing experiences in the chocolate factory... they seem just as selfish and ill-mannered when they leave as when they arrived... you'd think a near-death experience would shake them up a bit more..."

","Demented, twisted, funny. Great movie for the truly devoted Tim Burton fan. Depp was a real treat. In the original movie, there is a scene where Gene Wilder (as Willie Wonka) pulls a hair from one of the children's heads. Johnny Depp (as Willie Wonka in the second movie) does NOT hide his contempt for the nasty miscreants. It is very clear that although he is allowing these children into his domain, he is hoping that they will ALL fall victim to their own greed, and not be allowed to continue. <br/><br/>This movie is a delight. If you are as strange as I am (according to my grown children), you MUST see this movie. I do not believe that Under 17s will appreciate the tongue in cheek, black humor.

","Last night, my neighbor let our family borrow a few DVDs. During dinner, our family watched Madagascar. After that, we were bored, and my sister suggested ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory."" I thought ""Oh, why not?"" and put the DVD into the DVD Player. I must admit, my expectations were low.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, much more than I expected to. In my opinion, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory work for three reasons.<br/><br/>The first one is Johnny Depp's performance. He is an excellent actor. (His fan base is way too large.) He captures all the strange lines in a strange voice. He also captures all the weirdness that we would expect Willy Wonka to have, even if his character does sound weirder then he needs to be at times, like when he says: ""Good morning star shine, the earth says 'Hello!'"" <br/><br/>The second reason is Burton's weird world that he created. Like most re-makes, the newer one has to have better special effects. Charlie and the Chocolate Factory did have better special effects, and it made a better movie. It resembled the odd factory that the story takes place in.<br/><br/>The third and final reason the new Charlie and the Chocolate Factory works out is because it's funny! For example, take this scene: Willy Wonka: If you had to choose only one half of your son, which one would it be? Mr. Teavee: What kind of question is that? <br/><br/>But, the film does have its fair share of flaws. First of all, the film is weird, but seems like another adventure film, except with weird elements. It doesn't seem weird enough to seem original. Second, I preferred Gene Wilder to Johnny Depp. Third, the songs were not as good as the original. The songs in this movie didn't come as often, and didn't sound as good. The songs were just plain weird! Fourth, the film is unrealistic: even for a fantasy. The family is poor, and the father screws toothpaste caps on for a living. Now, how do they afford a television? But, the main reason it wasn't realistic was because of the children. Can the four wicked children not realize that they were being rude? No person in the right mind would play video games during an interview! Well, I enjoyed this film, for these three reasons, but thought it could have been better if those other reasons weren't existent.<br/><br/>7/10 <br/><br/>Good: Depp's performance, special effects, comedy, better than the original. <br/><br/>Bad: Too weird, Wilder was better, songs were worse and it was too unrealistic."

","As a world famous writer of Children's stories, Roald Dahl is also famous for the fact he doesn't like children. For this reason a story, such as Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is full of horrible children, who are of course tortured and punished in appropriate ways.<br/><br/>This may be why children love it so much.<br/><br/>This adaption of the book well and truly has the stamp of Tim Burton, same type of music, same sense of lighting and kooky characters. If you don't know the story, here it is. Willy Wonker, reclusive, genius, chocolate maker gives away tickets to 5 children to view his chocolate factory. This is a chocolate factory as it should be, an amazing land of chocolate rivers and weird machines.<br/><br/>But such a place also has dangers for the unwary.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp's performance make me wonder why they didn't just offer the role to Michael Jackson. That same feeling of loss of childhood and need for approval exists, along with the white skin, crazy clothes , inane smile and very high voice.<br/><br/>Charlie of course is bland, as is the nature of the character, while the other characters live up to the book.<br/><br/>Ultimately we get the Tim Burton movie experience, which, while I like Burton's movies, is failing to do too much on top of what he has done before.<br/><br/>Good, interesting, worth seeing. The musical numbers of some of the best in a children's movie in a long time simply because they are so obviously meant to be bad.<br/><br/>PS: surely the Oompa-loompas should be given control over the factory, it would only be fair."

","OK, I liked the 71 spin on Dahl's cautionary, confectionery tale, but compared to this cinematic feast for the eyes and ears, the Wilder vehicle pales in comparison. Wilder's Mr. Rogers-like manner and the nursery rhyme-like Oompa-Loompa chants about guzzling sweets the way an elephant eats, that film is more for the single digit age groups, in my opinion, while this sweet dark fantasy helmed by Tim Burton is for the kid in everyone, and the brilliant visuals and infectious music will bring out the tousle-haired, freckle-nosed, chocolate-smeared Tommy, Dickie, or Carlito residing in the heart of every Tom, Dick, and Carlos.<br/><br/>I liked Johnny Depp's sadistic, sarcastic, child-loathing portrayal of Roald Dahl's literary bombonero (""candymaker"" in Spanish) far better than Wilder's interpretation of the character as a confectionery Captain Kangaroo, and the whole part about Wonka's boyhood and his unpaternal dentist father was a nice touch.<br/><br/>And don't get me started on the MUSIC. Brilliant compositions by the extremely talented Mister Daniel Elfman, and the Oompa-Loompa songs, sung by the man himself, harkened back to my 80s teenhood with their sound reminiscent of Elfman's new-wave band Oingo Boingo.<br/><br/>Definitely a must-see for young, old, and everyone in between."

","Tim Burton's personal style is all over Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, an updated version of Roald Dahl's book that inspired the 1970s Gene Wilder movie Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory. The dark undertones beneath a happy, bubbly exterior, the heart of the movie is about greed while we enjoy the candy. The essence of chocolate is what this movie is about. While we enjoy the junk food, there is nothing good for you in it, and there is something evil about it rots your teeth. Burton's knack for making what was once a light and fluffy piece of work a darker, more foreboding piece of art shapes the effectiveness of this movie. He did it in the Michael Keaton Batman movie, and here, he uses a Johnny Depp that is channeling Michael Jackson to bring a new Willy Wonka to life. The man who lives within his own chocolate factory is eerie enough, but one who reminds us of a once famous pop singer who lives in his own Wonderland takes the movie to another level. Unfortunately, the timing could not be worse for the movie, as the weirdness of Mr. Jackson kind of ruins the effect of Depp's decision to make Wonka a weird-loaner type character. Freddie Highmore plays Charlie who lives with his family in a small house where all of his grandparents live in one bed. His one grandfather used to work for Wonka, and when Charlie finds the last golden ticket and wins a trip to the chocolate factory, he takes Grandpa Joe (David Kelly) with him. It's Charlie and 4 other children, all of which fall to greed and excess. The fate of each child is truly frightening, and parents should be warned that their children could be scared. The factory itself is truly awesome. The set pieces are wonderful, great looking, and allow the Oompa Loompas (all played by Deep Roy, digitally reproduced to give the allusion of an Oompa Loompa army) to stage their productions with ease and glamor. The music used is catchy, not the Oompa Loompa song from Willy Wonka, but instead 5 different styles, from rock to jazz. My only complaint came in the scenes explaining Wonka's motivation. It involves scenes with his father (Christopher Lee, which had to have set a record for most blockbuster films starred in in one decade) and his anti-candy bias. The reason for this provides a momentary chuckle, but I don't think I needed to know what made Wonka tick. Overall, the movie looks great, but the execution of the story is brought down by Depp's decision to make Wonka a modern day Michael Jackson, in an age of Michael Jackson."

","As a lukewarm fan of the original Gene Wilder film and knowing Tim Burton's track record for films with great production but no substance, I went into this with low expectations but I was very pleasantly surprised of how enjoyable this was.<br/><br/>I loved a few of Burton's movies (Big Fish, Ed Wood), but he always seems to make great looking films and his problem was that he never let the audience get to know the characters. Here we get a nice background and glimpse into Wonka's upbringing and why he became such an eccentric. The rest of the film follows along with the book and the original film pretty closely sans much of the music.<br/><br/>Wonka invites 5 kids and a guest to get a tour of the magical factory via a golden ticket. Whichever of the kids is the least irritating wins the ultimate prize. The oompa loompas, chocolate waterfall, and everything you might recall from the book are there. Burton creates everything to his imagination and employs his usual staple Johnny Depp as Willy Wonka. Depp is pretty good in his role as he plays Wonka like a little kid.<br/><br/>The original film was the very first movie I ever saw in a theater and it scared the crap out of me. Hey, it was 1971 and I was 2. There is nothing scary in this film and the whole family should get a kick out of it. (***)"

I know the story inside and out and the movie continued to surprise me. The set was fantastic and the lack of million dollar special effects rated this movie even higher in my eyes.

","Firstly let me start by saying that Depp was simply amazing in this movie (as usual). I genuinely believe that Charlie and the Chocolate Factory surpassed the 1971 musical staring Gene Wilder as Mr. Willy Wonka, which is saying something because believe me I simply adore the 71 version! However there was a greater depth to Depp's Wonka, with a revealing insight into his troubled childhood, which helped to shape the man he has become today. Depp adds a real insight into the mind of Willy Wonka, who from a characteristic point of view appears much more complex in this film version. We see him for what he truly is, incredibly creative, artistic but essentially he is still portrayed as a human being with human flaws. Willy Wonka is a man of mystery, an unknown, unseen phenomenon, until one day he reopens his factory for one day only and invites a few select lucky children in to freely view the wonders of his creation. However little did he know that by opening up his factory he was setting himself up to open up his heart to one boy in particular... Charlie Bucket. Through Charlie Wonka learns to love and live again. After Charlie leaves Wonka is left empty, finally unable to stand the steady decline of his creative flow, which inhibits his ability to produce the candy he is famous for, Wonka enlists the help of Charlie to regain what was lost by him so many years previous... the love and companionship of his father. As well as being an indisputable example of what makes film making great today Depp really reveals just how vulnerable even the strongest appearing of human beings can be. Highmore's Bucket also highlights the beautiful and regenerating nature of youth. Once Charlie discovers what exactly it is that has made Wonka so resentful of the family unit he sets about to change him with understanding, acceptance, and unbelievable kindness. In this respect the roles are reversed with Charlie (so old in mind for his years) allowing Wonka to revert back to the childhood that he never truly had. Even accompanying him for an emotional reunion with his father where Wonka discovers he had always been a loved child... even if it was from a distance. With this knowledge Wonka is able to move on. He has finally learnt to love and respect and is rewarded with a new extended family, his father and the Bucket's welcome Willy Wonka into a devoted and loving family unit that we can't help but hope will remain undivided. And what happened to poor, hungry Charlie Bucket? Well lets just say that with Wonka's new found compassion for humanity he and his family need never worry about money or food again!!!!"

","I tried so hard to give this film a fair chance. Unlike most of the other people who didn't enjoy it because of physical differences (the oompa-loompas LOOKING different) I was willing to give that a chance.<br/><br/>What bothered me the most was the acting of Depp himself. Where as in the original movie version, Wonka is creepy enough to be eccentric and enigmatic, it's realized that it's almost just a show. Depp doesn't do this at all! It's just, well, creepy! I don't get why the kids want to be there at ALL. Why is Charlie so amazed by him? I think if there were to be more conversation between Charlie and Grandpa Joe, viewers' questions are more easily answered, too. But the movie seems to be about Wonka, not Charlie.<br/><br/>While I thought it was interesting they dove a little into Wonka's childhood, I thought the viewer felt very detached from Charlie, for he wasn't allowed a fair amount of screen time. Everything moved very quickly in the beginning, and I can imagine if you don't know the story, you could be confused. They only did this to make more time, in my opinion, so the CGI and other sFX guys could get their time with the too-long loompa songs.<br/><br/>I don't know, while I am glad there is a bit more from the book (but remember, Roald Dahl supervised the first movie), I still think it's too different from the original to even compare.<br/><br/>Oh, and I didn't like all the references to other Tim Burton movies.

","I'm not sure if my comment contains a spoiler, but I have noted as such considering a few elements are discussed which some readers may not have been aware of, especially if they had planned on comparing this film with the original.<br/><br/>I grew up loving the original film and read the books and was giving this movie high hopes, but it didn't work completely for me. I still gave it a 6 for the craftsmanship behind the scenes and a genuine love of the story I could feel coming from the cast and crew. It's not a total waste, and the good parts I will let you discover for yourself, but there are flaws.<br/><br/>My main problem with the film is the pacing, and even worse, the choreography was terrible. I guess I was expecting moves like Oscar giant ""CHICAGO"", and considering Elfman did the underscore for that film, I'm totally saddened that the dance sequences weren't as tight as the music. Only one moment when the Loompettes were bouncing off of Violet's totally outrageous blueberry frame did I actually sit up and notice. But it was very brief and I was left wanting more.<br/><br/>I also felt that the effects destroyed the pacing of scenes, like the perfection of them were holding the story hostage. Since they were paying for such wild and realistic shots I can only guess Burton was compelled to include them all without editing them down for the sake of timing. <br/><br/>The scene where Varuca Salt get's thrown down the garbage shoot could have been compressed a wee bit more to augment the urgency of the situation, which wasn't suspenseful enough for me. No, I didn't believe a little girl was being overpowered by squirrels, despite the squirrels looked great. <br/><br/>Johnny Depp as Wonka is just plain creepy. He's a great actor but I would have thought someone ""down to earth"" would have made a better Wonka. I guess I saw Wonka from the books as being more like the Artful Dodger from Charles Dicken's OLIVER TWIST; someone vulnerable but strong, with color in his cheeks and boundless confidence. Wilder came close in the first film, but his Wonka was more airy, and Depp's Wonka was more metallic. Willy Wonka bonds with Charlie at the end of the story, so their connection must be genuine and solid. But someone like that obviously wouldn't have fit into the added subplot of a grown up child who hates his father for not letting him eat candy in his formative years. I think this irritated me most of all. Wonka is a hero, not a cripple! The children carry the psychology of the story, Wonka is just the provider of organized chaos, only so he can find a worthy successor to his throne. Reward comes from non-attachment and selflessness. That's the story! Nothing else required.<br/><br/>The bottom line is this is a great film to look at, the characters are classic, the morals are there, the music is catchy, the effects are superb and the finale is touching. But it didn't make me want to see it again. Like walking through a museum, it's more of a gallery of experiences than an actual ""ride"", despite the glass elevator is pretty cool."

In this movie, there were a few things that bugged me: the oompa-loompa's routines were freakish and there were far too many (plus the guy who plays them is a bit concerning), the whole candy aspect is a bit lost (no good candy-man scene, and the main focus doesn't seem to be on candy but instead the relationship of Charlie and Willy), however all of this small problems cannot put a damper on this movie.

Depp is usually one of my favorite actors, but he is just wrong for Wonka and doesn't work in the least. The other performances are good though, as is the direction. The story has been majorly changed so it fits Tim Burtons usual plot about the bad guys or at least the unhappy ones having bad relationships with their parents, fathers in particular.

","Touted by many advocates as being closer to the original Roald Dahl book than the 1971 film, director Tim Burton's version both restores some elements of the book and adds just as many changes as the Mel Stuart-directed film. Even if authenticity to the source is of prime importance to you, this version is worth seeing, especially for fans of Burton and star Johnny Depp.<br/><br/>Burton sacrifices some of the mystery of the 1971 version in favor of trying to more ""realistically"" ground his odd characters, at least psychologically, as he often does--for example, in Batman (1989). Other characteristic Burton touches are present--grandiose yet lachrymose sets (an asset), regular references to other films (usually a detraction here), and the music of Danny Elfman (enjoyable, but the songs are not as sublime and memorable as Anthony Newley's 1971 music).<br/><br/>Burton and Depp wisely avoid paralleling Gene Wilder's most famous scenes as Willy Wonka, and Depp takes the character in a very different direction, though equally quirky (and different from the book). Here, Wonka seems to be a bit less god-like and a bit more in a psychological world of his own, but it works in its own way. Still, huge fans of the original film (and I'm one of them--it's easily in my top five of all time) might have difficulty not making comparisons, and Burton's version will suffer in their minds because of this."

Perhaps it is this that many are drawn to in their connection of Depp's Wonka being a send up of Jackson, but I disagree whole heartedly and say Depp gave us the Wonka that was intended in the book.

"dc_follies","5","0","1","14 November 2005"," Not much improvement seen
","When I first heard that they were going to remake Willie Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, I thought that it was an odd movie to remake. Sure, the movie in the 70s was a little campy, but could also be considered a classic children's movie that succeeds very well on its own. I didn't feel that it had the same potential to improve as a movie like Oceans 11 would.<br/><br/>The remake of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory actually starts out quite strong. There is more background behind the motivation of Wonka to open up his factory and the personalities of the children have been given a face-lift as well. Americans really are pretty annoying. Up until the time where the children reach the Wonka factory, I felt that the movie actually had improved upon the old.<br/><br/>And then comes Johnny Depp as Willie Wonka. Let me preface my next comment by saying that I enjoy Johnny Depp in most everything and dislike Gene Wilder in most everything. The Willie Wonka character came off as someone you wouldn't let your child within ten miles of, much less go into a factory with. The performance of Willie Wonka was one of the worst that I have seen in recent memory. Perhaps some of that feeling was also due to the fact that the chocolate factory had lost much of its charm from the original film. The oompa loompas were forgettable, as was the music, and it seemed like much of the happiness of the original movie was sapped.<br/><br/>The end of the film was also changed from the original version in a way that I didn't care for either. Without being too specific, in the original, Charlie drinks the fizzy soda which was against Mr. Wonka's rules and loses his prize. In the end, though, Charlie realizes that what he did was wrong and decides not to seek vindication against Wonka. In the current movie, Charlie is never posed with any question of vindication, nor does he do anything wrong that would exclude his eligibility from winning a prize.<br/><br/>The film is decent with a nice update on the pre-factory portion of the movie, but much of the magic of the factory is missing from the current film and Wonka's character has a very unsavory feel. This film does not significantly improve upon its predecessor and therefore deserves no more than an average grade."
"christopherborne","9","0","2","9 November 2005"," Burtonesque through and through
","Tim Burton is a genius in film making. With _Edward Scissorhands_ and _Nightmare Before Christmas_, Burton has proved himself a man with vision, and _Charlie and the Chocolate Factory_ is no different.<br/><br/>Many people spoke out against this film, as I did when I first heard of its release. Gene Wilder has said that the Burton film is nothing more than a money-making scheme. Ironic, as Wilder's Wonka film was nothing more than a 100 minute ad for Quaker Oat's Wonka Bar. I though that nothing could possibly top the 1971 Mel Stuart film _Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory_.<br/><br/>I was wrong.<br/><br/>First of all, the sets. The Burton sets are amazing and wacky, on par with previous Burton films and the Dahl novel of the same name. The squirrel room and the Chocolate Room are tres fantastique.<br/><br/>Second of all, the story. The biggest problem, I thought, with the original Stuart film was that it was too regular. It took what may be the weirdest children's novel in history into just another Disneyesque film. The Burton film is truly wacky, with Johnny Depp doing a complete reworking of Gene Wilder's famous Wonka performance. The plot is also completely weird and Dahly, even where the plots differ, as in the presence of Wonka's dentist father. This brings up another point. There are some interesting parallels between Charlie and Wonka. Both of their fathers work in the tooth-care field (as Charlie's father works as a cap-screwer-oner). Both Wonka and Charlie had little exposure to chocolate, as Charlie is extremely poor, and Wonka's father is overprotective of his son's teeth. And throughout the film, certain comments made by Charlie perfectly reflect those of Wonka. Fans of the novel will cringe a little, but will, in the end, rejoice.<br/><br/>Third of all, les acteurs. Freddie Highmore's performance of Charlie in the 2005 film is light-years ahead of Peter Ostrum's portrayal of him in the 1971 film. The other child stars are also more talented than their predecessors, with the possible exception of Julia Winter in the role of Veruca Salt. One might be compelled to compare the performances of Depp and Wilder, but this would be akin to comparing Vermicious Knids to Himalayan cats. This film also bouts the presence of Charlie's father (played by Noah Taylor), not present in the Stuart film but present in the novel. And Christopher Lee, known as Count Duku to _Star Wars_ fans, is excellent as Wilbur Wonka, D.D.S, Willy's father. Deep Roy, the oompaloompa (all oompaloompas in the film are digital copies of Mr.Roy), is excellent as the little people.<br/><br/>My verdict: Even though _Charlie_ is better, _Wonka_ still has a place in my heart.<br/><br/>Adieu. Auf Wiedersehen. Gesundheit. Farewell."

","The original flick from 1971 is exactly the same, except for maybe 2 points: Willy Wonka's flashback to his childhood and the intermissions where the Umpa-Lumpa('s?) demonstrate a more modern style of singing.<br/><br/>For the rest both movies are interchangeable. So it's not bad, but lacks originality compared to the first one, doesn't add any new dimension to Mel Stuart's version with Gene Wilder as Willy Wonka and therefor makes you wonder why someone thought that people were waiting for this remake....<br/><br/>For the rest, the atmosphere of the Charlie's poor family, the characters of the other winners to amy visit the Chocolate Factory, the colourfull fantasy-interior of the factory: it's great, captured perfectly from Roald Dahl's novel. But also as already seen before...."

","That movie rocks!!! It is sooo good mostly because it has Johnny Depp and Freddie Highmore in it but yeh it is just the best EVER!!!!!!!!!!!! I am even buying the movie on thursday 10.11.05 and it is just the best, i even went to see it at the cinemas 4 times!!!!! all of my friends think i am crazy for it but most of them liked it too. my best friend absolutely hated it so i didn't like that comment especially though i took her for her birthday but most of my other friends liked it. I thought that it was just soooo much better than the old movie and it was just soooo clever how they had based most things the same but were able to make it so much better!!!!!!! so that s what i think!"
"tigger_68","4","0","1","13 November 2005"," OK But Not Real Great
","As a lifelong fan of both the book and the 1971 film, I was eager to view this movie to see what Burton did with it.<br/><br/>To its credit, it does add a number of aspects from the original book, such as the chocolate palace.<br/><br/>But it also adds a great deal of stuff, such as the backstory on Wonka's dad, which was never in the book. It also stretches out the ending in a way that I found kind of silly.<br/><br/>As others have said, Burton takes his usual off the wall direction in terms of sets. Depp is a deeply creepy Wonka.<br/><br/>If that were the sum of it, I'd be willing to chalk this up to just a different take on the story.<br/><br/>But the one thing that was really lacking for me is the same thing lacking in many films today, that sense of magic of story.<br/><br/>While the visuals are impressive, they are not all required. The original film managed to convey the spirit of the story without a bunch of effects.<br/><br/>For example, in the original film you didn't see what made the elevator fly, and you didn't need to. It was just part of the magic of the story.<br/><br/>Here, for some reason, we need giant jet engines to fly around.<br/><br/>If you're a Burton fan, this is certainly up there in terms of his style of movie.<br/><br/>But if you were looking for the spirit of the book, try again."
"pc95","6","0","1","12 November 2005"," Some fun visuals - decent remake
","This remake of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory pretty much plays it safe, so there's little new here. To compare it to the original would leave it a step below, especially in the musical numbers and the pull of the main characters. Freddy Highmore and David Kelly are decent. Willy Wonka as sort of a child-adult here comes across pretty flat and unnecessarily grotesquely androgynous. What's the point? Anyway despite that, the factory looks interesting and there were some ingenious placings of the Umpa Lumpas. Particularly liked the strange scene in the jungle where Wonka recalls meeting Umpa Lumpas and bringing them back. So, is it worth owning? Not really, I'd pass. It'd be worth viewing if you like fantasies or enjoy the original."
"peteranderson","7","0","1","11 November 2005"," A Good Effort!
","The film was a good effort. Johnny Deep gave a decent performance, Charlie also. Very good shots and settings. The parts they changed ruined the film and that is why a 7 is the best they can have. No outstanding acting. But the magical feeling and the mood and genres created were hit right on target and some feeling was expressed. Some good one liners as well. And fantastic Liz Smith was amusing. A good winters film, a good family movie. I am harsh with marks, but from me a 7 does. So a good effort. And recommended. But for me, the key part missing was that special bond between Wonka and Charlie. I remember the two having a really sweet kind of bond in the first one, this was nowhere to be seen in this one.<br/><br/>So to improve they could have- Used more character relations between Wonka and Charlie, stuck to the original plot and get some more funny and embarrassing moment of that kid/child vulgar humour over. Family fun and humour."

","My friends took me out to see this on the IMAX screen. I really fell in love with this film. It started out greatly and ended up with a wonderful heart warming story. It is also a fantastic remake of the original Willy Wonka. Tim Burton is back to his form of fantasy direction, like Big Fish, Batman, Beetlejuice etc. He has a terrific eye on visuals and screen compositions.<br/><br/>The film started out like his previous ones, with superb music by Danny Elfman and great Sets. It is the story of Charlie Bucket, who is a poor kid and would want to visit the Chocolate Factory to meet the great creator. He gets his chance with five other kids, and embarks on Chocolate Adventure of his life. The Characters are great, each and everyone from Charlie's Grandpa to the five kids listed in the film. The best character to come so far is Willy Wonka played by Johnny Depp. He does his characterization beautifully and you think he is actually playing this rock-star type character. He is totally twisted, dark and humorous. Even the small role given to Christopher Lee is good, it starts out very evil and come out good.<br/><br/>The Sets in the factory are amazing, they totally catch your imagination in the film. The Music delivered by Danny Elfman was fabulous, it was like watching Edward Scissorhands again. Watching it on the IMAX format made me fascinate the film even more as the film looked more life like. The Visuals are also terrific, you could not tell them apart from the rest of the movie.<br/><br/>In the end, this is a fabulous film made for the whole family to watch and a great film to view again. I do hope Johnny Depp gets a nomination for this film, he is too perfect in the film. One of the Best summer films of this year. I rate it 10/10. A Choco Treat for all."
"oscarhopkins","5","0","1","8 November 2005"," Backwash from Burton
","If Tim Burton so wanted to play Willy Wonka, he shouldn't have bothered to trot out tired, over-hamming Johnny Depp at all. He might just as well have played the candy mogul of Roald Dahl's classic books himself, if all he expected of Willy Wonka was a self-indulgent man-child with no joy or maturity of heart and soul.<br/><br/>This film does not contain, save in name alone, any semblance of the character Willy Wonka.<br/><br/>Again, Burton takes a brilliant cast, a great story, and amazing characters, and wallows in self-interest. Again we need the flashbacks? Again with a nasty, controlling dad in flashback?? AGAIN with the anti-family, spoiled-bratty attitude towards loved ones and community??? Now I think I've hit on why Tim didn't play Willy. No one could have told him apart from Veruca.<br/><br/>Otherwise, the film is a smash, with a Charlie Bucket to end all Charlie Buckets, Oompa Loompas whose songs are by far the sweetest morsels in this box of goodies. The splashy-number routine does, however, make the words hard to hear. Visually, the film is also well-designed, but sometimes poorly used. The backgrounds and scenery are so delightful, the costumes and lighting so appropriate, that it is surprising when some major-event scenes suffer from a lack of punch.<br/><br/>Here for apparently no reason is Helena Bonham Carter, who does nothing at all interesting as Charlie's mother. Charlie's father is played to better effect by Noah Tyler, a master of brief scenes whose quirky talents shall be vindicated by time.<br/><br/>A very sincere thanks to Deep Roy, who is a man of extreme talents.<br/><br/>A very sincere pooh-pooh to Tim Burton, for showing how stagnant the waters of his well have become."

","Luckily this movie focuses on the family and on mostly positive things in the end, whereas Lemony Snicket was pretty much drab and negative throughout. Depp's voice is irritating and it's very strange to me that they chose to use only one person to play all of the Ompa Loompas. If you've watched Lemony Snicket then you've pretty much watched this movie. Both my wife and I said to ourselves that this movie was a complete waste of about 1h 40m. If you compare it to the original Chocolate Factory you just scratch your head and wonder what they hoped to accomplish in this movie. I look at the average rating for this movie at the time I'm writing this and see 7.5/10 and wonder what everyone else is thinking of. Maybe I'm just old fashioned but I really don't understand what is so good about this movie that it would deserve even an average rating."

","Now I am a big Tim Burton fan, and quite fond of his favorite star, mr Depp, in pretty much all of his productions..<br/><br/>But perhaps that was just the problem; I had quite high expectations, and found myself rather disappointed in the end..<br/><br/>The movie is quite colorful and oddish, just the way I like it, but that's pretty much where the good stuff ends for me. Sure, there were some funny bits n pieces here and there, but in whole, the movie was rather boring.<br/><br/>The pace was quite predictable and tempered, clearly so kiddies won't lose track of what's going on; Johnny Depp, who is capable of performing quite amazing characters just didn't seem to really be in there.. as though he just grabbed together some elements of former roles - a bit of Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas here, a bit of Finding Neverland there, with the typical 'what on earth are you babbling about?'-oddity that marks his style - and .. did his thing.<br/><br/>Actually, apart from the grandparents, I found all acting rather dull. The characters are put down very well, no doubt about that; very expressive in terms of their stereotypic roles.. but their responses to important (supposidly shocking) events lacked any of the animation you'd expect.. (perhaps because these events were to a large extend 3d-animations, giving the whole movie this blue-screen-movie feel)<br/><br/>They simply were not THERE. (For those of you who've seen 'Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow', and felt that the sense of presence by the actors was lacking know what I'm talking about..) Imagine a plane crashing into a school and the parents going like ""oh my, thats not good, is it?"" with only a mildly worried look upon their faces.. just no emotional congruence whatsoever..<br/><br/>Then the sound-track bored me, and the Oompa Loompa's just got on my nerves.<br/><br/>Basically, I felt there was a lot of unused potential in this movie, as though Tim Burton just wanted this thing finished asap, so he could tend to his other projects.."
"stumpmee77","2","0","1","24 October 2005"," Not impressed, folks, not impressed!
","Too many add-ons to the Wonka background and distortions of the Wonka character. Yep, the 1971 version of Willy Wonka was the book's Wonka. Just like in the book, nothing was known about the great candy man's background other than his being betrayed by his fellow candy makers and his finding the oompa loompas. Where, why did Burton cook up these pace slowing flashbacks with the warped daddy, drawn out decision making of Charlie and that ludicrous ending? <br/><br/>Why did Burton once again put Depp as the star? Not only I'm getting tired of seeing this happening but there doesn't look like there was any credence to them as professionals for doing so. I can think of at least three other stars who could have made the character come off funny with the lines given--Not Depp it just doesn't work. It's the worse case of miscasting I've seen this year.<br/><br/>As others have said neither does the acting of the parents of these other kids work. There's no hysteria when these bratty children are harmed. The change in what happened to Veruca is not fit for sensitive children and seeing them at the end--well besides the garbage looking fake to me, it didn't appear they had learned from the ordeal. I learned something; not to recommend this claptrap to anyone.<br/><br/>The only reason to see this film is the boy who plays ""way too saintly"" Charlie."
"DrDuane","4","0","1","21 October 2005"," Beware what you expect
","If you go expecting ANYTHING on the level of Gene Wilder's sublime performance as Wonka, you will be disappointed on many levels. The spare (also dated) sets of the original worked, and have aged, well. Burton's style is, well, Burton's style - he wows you but is unlikely to really surprise you with his approach. I've seen previous observations that this is a reimagining of the book and should not be called similar to the previous incarnation. Agreed, but some performances are so hard to ""reimagine"" (Brando in ""Godfather,"" Bogart in ""Casablanca, et al) that even attempting to do so is almost futile. A good try, but I'll stick with the original if I want to see the story, and with something else by Burton if I want to see his stylings."
"jasonay","7","0","1","21 October 2005"," Interesting take on the book
","As a huge fan of both the book and original movie, it was with great anticipation that I entered the theater. I was a little bit disappointed, but to be honest this re-make does have some merits. The acting is great, as expected from Depp, and I thought the children were well chosen for their roles. The Oompa Loompa dances were amazing, much better than the pathetic attempts at cartwheels in the previous adaption. Another nice asset was the character of Violet Beaugrand. In the book her only vice was chewing too much gum, not really a significant enough fault to merit turning into a some sort of purple balloon. Here, she is also a type A perfectionist, always trying to win, an annoying and increasing trait in modern day children.<br/><br/>Now the bad news. Depp's Micheal Jackson approach to the character of Willy Wonka is interesting, but seemed a little out of place. The boat ride was a huge disappointment. In the original movie, it's one of the scariest scenes ever filmed, with rapid images of worms crawling over corpses and chickens being decapitated. I have even seen it on a list of the top 100 screen scares. This time around, however, it's really tame. The ending also bothered me, when we're introduced to Wonka's father. It destroys the mystery created in the book, where the lack of background information about Wonka made him more ominous, more exciting.<br/><br/>That said, I'd still recommend this movie for the great story and special effects, and fans of the original should also enjoy comparing the two very different versions of the classic novel."
"keitarou_chan_naru","7","0","1","12 October 2005"," another classic but not as good
","This movie I thought was another Tim Burton Classic. But, it did leave some to be desired I think. I did like how in the movie it showed Charlie as a boy who was down on his luck but was dealing with it one day at a time and family oriented. As for Wonka it seemed like he just got out of an insane asylum on a temporally leave of absence.<br/><br/>If you watch the original version (1971) and compare it to the current version it did leave a lot to compare, such as: in the 71 version Wonka seemed like a normal person who was a bit rude at times but an overall nice guy. In this version it seemed like he was a jerk from the beginning and only in the last 10 to 15 minutes of the movie he seemed to turn around, AFTER dealing with his sociological father complex he had developed as a child. If you were looking for a halfway musical like in the first one DO NOT expect one in this one. In the 71 version the Umpa Lumpas are actually midgets when in the new version the Umpa Lumpa(s) are a regular person just computer copied and shrunken on screen.<br/><br/>Some of better parts of the movie were the visual effects and the glass Wonkavator.<br/><br/>After watching this version once I might think of watching it one more time but when the 71 version comes on I would turn to that one instead in a heartbeat."
"whitneyistheone3223","9","0","1","12 October 2005"," Sweeter than the original!
","Not much fault can be found with the film. It may err a bit in that while titled ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,"" the story tends to shift focus much more onto Willy Wonka's character journey than on Charlie's. While I can't say if that's closer to the book, it is such an intriguing journey that audiences really don't seem to mind. Johnny Depp is always a pleasure to watch in any film he's in, so we just have grown accustomed to him being in the spotlight. And perhaps Charlie, while still a kid, has already been on the journey because of his excursion through poverty and it's now his turn to help someone else in need.<br/><br/>Does it top the original? In many ways, yes it does. It's much closer to the book according to Burton, and now we know why Willy Wonka is so loopy. Johnny Depp delivers one of the funniest performances of his career, and just like in Finding Neverland, he and Freddie Highmore have great chemistry together on screen. This movie is a treat for all ages - one that is funny and entertaining and stands above the original film as yet another great cinematic achievement for Tim Burton."
"Luluhalabaloo","9","0","1","10 October 2005"," It's a Small Small World catches fire - we can only hope
","This film translates so well to IMAX, where I saw it with with my 12-year-old son. There is no question that a film adapted for IMAX just adds so much! Besides the classic Tim Burton look, it takes you right into the film as opposed to simply watching the film. But the real scene stealer, the man of the show, of course was Johnny Depp.<br/><br/>There is not one movie in which he plays a part that doesn't cave to his on-screen charisma. It is so obvious that Johnny loves to act and loves to act in fun, character-driven roles. Every look, swing of the hand, and grimace has intelligent nuance and meaning behind it. This brings such a robust, well-rounded attitude to the character of Willy Wonka, and frankly, one that only a parent could love.<br/><br/>His dismissal of the kids, not so much the words other than the ""what would it matter"" or the ""stop mumbling"" lines, but the looks he gives, the ""smiles"" or grimaces, the wave of his hand when he first starts the tour, all reminiscent of a parent who has, well, had enough for awhile and really doesn't like kids all that much anyway.<br/><br/>But how about his lascivious look at Violet's mother? Johnny Depp can look at me anytime like that - so sexy - he becomes an adult right there...or,the crazy loon look when they were going ""up and out""? Only Johnny Depp can channel his other characters, like Hunter S. Thompson (Raoul Duke from Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas) in the jungle scene especially peeking out from beneath his hat, walking in that unique Raoul Duke - wait a minute Raould Dahl/Raoul Duke - whoa - way (yes, he does the swagger in the jungle) or trying the green bug slime (andrenachrome anyone?), or Edward Scissorhands (papa? sniff sniff) and get away with it as only Johnny Depp can. It's almost like a separate Johnny Depp sub-culture that permeates all his films now - and I like it! <br/><br/>There were lots of adult jokes (""don't touch the squirrel's nuts, that makes him crazy""), or ""try some of my grass"". There were drug references like the repeating of the same thing (hmmm, grass?) and the phasing out (hmmm, grass again? or just tired of the kids...). And if you are a parent sandwiched between kids and older parents, you will get the old people jokes. (My son couldn't stop laughing at his look when visiting his father - he says I get the same look on my face when visiting my mom or dad). <br/><br/>I also loved the ""white hair"" look - there were absolutely no adults over 21 in the crowd but me, so I was the only one laughing when he held his new white hair up and looked at it with that look that only those of us who have lived through the first white hair go through. Which brings me to the Good morning, star shine line - immediately Hair - which just cemented for me the idea that this movie is geared to 40-somethings.<br/><br/>My son saw a lot of me in Johnny Depp's performance which meant to me that the performance itself was recognizable as a disgusted parent speaking with that ""I'm going to kill you but we are in public now"" teeth talk which is so familiar to many, especially those around grandparents and kids too much and are starting to be not overly fond of either.<br/><br/>Interestingly, the elevators were hilarious - I used to have nightmares about elevators going in all directions and I was speechless when I saw it in this movie. That, along with the boat ride - heck you can almost see the Disney ride! There were obvious references to that stoner of a movie, 2001 A Space Odyssey,and in my opinion, when the puppets are singing a la ""It's a Small Small World"" Disney ride which bursts in flames (we can only hope), and I even thought ""The Fly"" with the teleporter, along with, or course, ""Hair"". The ""relatively new"" puppet hospital and burn centre, the pink sheep, can't see them as kiddie jokes, and his braces/headgear - oh yeah, so reminiscent of my 70's teenage years (although I too have oddly perfect teeth as do my all my 40 something cousins). And the platform boots/""Prince"" get up...so 40 something. <br/><br/>I'll tell you, at the beginning I half expected Vincent Price to pop out during the chocolate making scene - wow, how Edward Scissorhands. And frankly, the hut and the snow - Fiddler on the Roof meets Beetlejuice. Actually, the TV scene set reminded me of ""The Prisoner (the 60's show). I bet there is a ton of stuff I am missing but I only saw the movie once so once I see it again, maybe I will post some more if I see anything else! And maybe have a glass of wine before...<br/><br/>A kid's movie? I don't know, really. My son caught the adult jokes because he would look sidelong at me each time they happened (like the squirrel's nuts joke) which he has been doing lately now that the jokes aren't flying over his head like they used to when he was younger. Johnny Depp is not a child's actor per se, but a smart kid can appreciate some of the things he says and does, as most adults can. This movie seems to be riddled with inside, 40-something culture knocks - no one in the theatre laughed until someone laughed at us because they were all too young to relate. <br/><br/>Definitely one of the smartest movies around - and much as I love chocolate, I wish to never get fat and stuck in a tube or be rolled around for de-juicing. New nightmares to add on to my collection of sideways elevator rides."

","OK! So like many other females I am a HUGE fan of Johnny Depp, but in this role, not trying to be unkind, he looks more freak than sheek. Mnay people have compared Depp's look to Michael Jackson, so as you can guess not how I wanted to see him. But this film is a marvelous 'remake' of 'Willy Wonker and the Chocolate Factory', it isn't as good.......it's better. The comedic effects contrasted with the darkness and sinister level of Burtons direction makes for excellent viewing. It is an all round winner in my books. Superb use of colour and special effects that will blow you away. In typical Tim Burton style, this film manages to stand out from all other movies. I love the mysteriousness and darkness of Depp's character, the infamous 'Willy Wonka', totally not what I expected after seeing the older flick, 'Willy Wonker and the Chocolate Factory', even though the character was doubted in the earlier version you seriously have to wonder whether this character is for real or not. This film is built and based upon total fantasy and really doesn't disappoint. IT will make you laugh and have you singing along in no time. The 'Umpa Lumpa's will split your sides open."

","I thought that it was a mediocre effort on the part of Depp & Robbins; it just didn't gel. Visually, the style and pace were stunning. I thought that the Oompa Loompa actor was incredible and was worthy of some award or praise. However, the musical sequences were trite and awkward. I think that Robbins' has changed somehow, and I think it has something to do with the changing of the muse from Lisa Marie to Helena Bonham-Carter. 'Corpse Bride' is a much better bet and is appropriate for children, even in its creepiness. I also think that 'Bride' is about the love triangle created by Robbins' & Marie's divorce... I paid full price for 'Charlie' and 'Bride' and was not regretful for the latter."
"come2whereimfrom","7","0","2","2 October 2005"," i loved the original too much.
","Charlie and the chocolate factory. I have been in love with the original film since I was small boy and must have watched it over fifty times. (My sister and I can really annoyingly quote huge pieces of dialogue and frequently do when drunk!) So it is with slight apprehension I go to see Tim Burton's remake/interpretation of the Roald Dahl classic (lets not forget what he did to planet of the apes!). Firstly I have to say there were things I loved about his version and things I preferred from the 70's one. It's so hard not to compare the two. Burtons film starts off very flat, when introducing us to the bucket family we are supposed to feel so sorry for but it lacks emotional depth, in fact all the kids do, I couldn't really care less about any off them. The 70's ones were much more bitchy and spoilt and that's what made you almost root for their demise. Now don't get me wrong here this film is a sight to behold gone is the campness of the orange faced ummpa lumpas and instead comes the uniformity of using one actor to play all of them to startling effect. From the moment they arrive on screen to perform the first song they have you in fits of laughter as Willy Wonka says 'they like to be mischievous'. Obviously Johnny Depp turns in another amazing performance as Willy complete with mannerism usually associated with Michael Jackson's childlike freakishness. All false smiles and twinkling eyes and a nervous disposition stemming mainly from his dislike of children and families. The songs here are funny and come in styles ranging from pop, rock and disco, with the ummpas pulling off dance routines that the village people would have died for. With most of the script and jokes aimed firmly at kids you have to regress slightly to get full enjoyment out of the weirdness of the factory as Willy leads you around from room to room visiting the places where his imagination becomes reality. There is nothing bad about this film apart from the fact they didn't ask gene wilder (the original Wonka) to play Willy's dad, and a few brilliant lines from the original were sadly missing. The 70's version was a lot darker and gene wilder's Willy always came over a little schizophrenic where as Depp's seems slightly playful and just not all there. Sadly for me being a fan of the first I missed Roy Kinear, fizzy lifting drinks and lickable wallpaper. But the new version brings back the squirrels and is magical to watch. Like a fruit and nut bar laced with drugs this film will leave you wide eyed."

","Living where I do, we get all films a month or two after it comes out. This was worth the wait. If this don't get Burton and Depp an Oscar nothing will. If Christopher Lee were to die tomorrow, he would be remembered as a brilliant actor, simply from this performance. Nowadays, if I so much as look at a lollipop, all I can hear is 'cavities on sticks!' The technicolour sets mean that for several days after, everything is in several shades of grey until you get used to the lack of colour in the world. This one puts Gene Wilder and those orange and green Oompa-Loompas to shame, especially when you consider that was Deep Roy all on his lonesome. Definitely go and see it, it's way better on the big screen than it will be on the telly with commercial breaks. <br/><br/>Bon appétit."

","Tim Burton had a captive audience, an audience that truly wanted this remake to succeed. And, well, he blew it, in my opinion.<br/><br/>The opening credits were enthralling, the factory and Charlie's house captivating, Noah Taylor as Charlie's Father a pleasant surprise, one-armed Arthur as Grandpa Joe great casting, casting in general a comforting factor  and I was settling in to enjoy a nostalgic trip back to Roald Dahl land. And then we entered the Chocolate Factory. The puppet show, while enabling an introduction to Willy Wonka and highlighting his subtle sarcasm, was dismal as were the children's reactions to it all. We headed on in and entered the Chocolate Room and this is where I started to feel queasy in the pit of my stomach and the stench of a bad film turn to bile in the back of my throat.<br/><br/>Tell me Mr Burton, with all today's technology, why the Chocolate room looked just like the one out of the original film. Explain to me why it didn't dazzle me. I'm not a jaded movie goer by any means, and I don't really go in for gadgetry in film but it seems you blew an awful lot of money on the opening sequence and then didn't have any left over for the Chocolate room.<br/><br/>And, while I'm in question mode, just how tall is an Oompa Loompa? In some scenes they were mid-calf in height, while in others they were waist-high. Are they elastic? Or made from Taffy? So they can be pulled into any height Mr Wonka decides? Alas, no, it was just pretty terrible animation and cinematography. Oh, there was so much wrong with the Oompa Loompas that I can't even begin to get into it here without reducing myself to a wailing mess.<br/><br/>Despite my comments above, the film, in general, had charm and was enjoyable. There were stunning moments and cringe worthy moments. I was taken to new highs and plummeted to new depths. And, the comparisons to the original kept surfacing, even though I fought them off with a passion. Gene Wilder was a charming Willy Wonka who eventually won over the audience by showing his humanity. Johnny Depp (or was it Michael Jackson in disguise?) was obviously given no real direction to take the character and he labored and eventually drowned in his own performance.<br/><br/>Shortly before the release of this film I had the misfortune to read a diatribe from Mr Burton which stated that he absolutely hated the original film even though he had not seen it (unbelievable!!) and that the film even had the wrong name (i.e. Willy Wonka and the CF instead of C and the CF). He stated he wouldn't be remaking that film but putting together something which adhered closely to the book. In fact, he missed loads of the book out and ended up with a montage of both the original film and the book  I think if I hadn't read Mr Burton's article I would have enjoyed the film more. I felt Mr Burton's ego simply got in the way."
"Tazmanhomie","7","0","1","30 September 2005"," A tough one to rate
","Overall, it was very difficult to discern exactly what I thought about Burton's adaption of Dahl's novel. At times, I felt that the biggest disappointment about the film was that the storytelling was at times garbled and at times confusing, given the impression perhaps of relying more upon readers' existing knowledge of the story of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory to fully appreciate the interpretation of the film; admittedly, a good knowledge of the story was fairly certain from most viewers, however this sacrifice in storytelling left the film lacking full integrity. Particularly laboured was the portion of the film before the children entered the factory - as a true case in point, Burton reprised the 'fake golden ticket' storyline from Stuart's movie, but dealt with it so rapidly in passing that its real value in the movie is questionable.<br/><br/>In analysing Depp's interpretation of Wonka, it is impossible to avoid comparisons with Wilder's, but as the characters were so vastly different, comparisons become difficult. At times, Depp felt unsettling: while the darker aspects of his Wonka were a refreshing body added to empty shell which was Dahl's original Wonka without compromising the allure of the eccentric, the childish insecurities he displayed were more difficult to accept. Wilder's Wonka, while darker than Dahl's, never lost his likability nor his powerful standing in the factory, but Depp's Wonka in his more childish moments seemed to lose charisma; a charismatic Wonka surely should be considered the key to a good portrayal of this story. As a case in point, it is difficult to be drawn to Depp as he insecurely jokes about cannibalism.<br/><br/>Emphasis of the other characters shifted in Burton's Charlie and the Chocalate Factory when compared with Stuart's Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory. In Stuart's movie, the parents of the children were given the starring support roles, in particular Roy Kinnear's Mr Salt and Leonard Stone's Mr Beauregarde. Enjoyable as these characters were, it detracted from the fact that Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is supposed to revolve around the characters of the children and revealing why Charlie is indeed the moral superior to the others. As such, Burton deals with these side characters better than Stuart, and with the exception of Augustus Gloop, whose character has no real scope for embellishment, the four other children are the supporting characters who shine, in particular Jordan Fry's Mike Teavee and Annasophia Robb's Violet Beauregarde, whose characters were altered significantly from Dahl's hollow beginnings. Of the parents, it is only Missi Pyle's Mrs Beauregarde who displays any substance of character, working beautifully in tandem with Robb to present the stereotypical corn-fed American mother-daughter team. In this respect, Burton hit the mark much more closely than did Stuart, but given that the original book offered no substance to any of the parents or children, both have dealt with the problem in appropriate manners.<br/><br/>Charlie's devotion to the wellbeing of his family was well written and believable by convincing performances by Highmore, Carter, and Taylor. However, it was included as an antithesis to Wonka's own family traumas, and these segments of the film, in which Wonka lapsed into flashback and then the conclusion towards the end, felt laboured, especially given the uneasiness of Depp's Wonka. Highmore's Charlie, and the little yet obvious moments in which he puts his family first, are endearing.<br/><br/>The key drawcard of this film was Elfman's score, particularly the instrumental score. The rousing instrumental number over which the opening credits ran was simply brilliant. The oompa-loompa songs, each performed in a different style - each performed in a different style, as compared with the well-known oompa-loompa songs from Stuart's film - added some light-hearted diversity.<br/><br/>The visuals were disappointing. Much of the interior of the factory was excessively cartoonish, particularly the room with the waterfall, or the nut sorting room. Furthermore, the exterior of the factory and some of the corridors were very sterile and uninviting. The enhanced realism of the sets in Stuart's film made that factory more engaging.<br/><br/>As negative as this summary is, a lot of it is made in comparison with Stuart's Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, which would receive a rating of 9/10. Burton portrayed the same classic story with better supporting characters, but in a confusing manner. Furthermore, it is still difficult to discern whether or not Depp's portrayal of Wonka should be hailed a success or so-so. Even so, it cannot be suggested for a moment that Burton has done Dahl's classic anything but justice, and for that it receives 7/10."

","A delicious family-sized gateau of a film - a slice of morality-for-the-kids-of-today here, a slice of nostalgia for seasoned fans of Dahl's subversive, black treacle stories there.<br/><br/>Burton's realisation of the true narrative of the book is a relief and a joy as we are whisked through the factory as we should be. Yes - THAT is how we imagined it! (the 1971 effort was always a bad nut, a silly make-the-story-up-as-we-go-along goose - what on earth are Gandpa Joe and Charlie doing bubbling up there?)<br/><br/>This version's power to transport the viewer, glass-elevator style, into a familiar (for the British viewer at least, LS Lowry paintings are hung nearby) yet not-quite-real fantasy world is its most potent ingredient. We are cleverly drawn into caring about, and anticipating the Golden Ticket for, (a well acted) Charlie by both the soothing, avuncular narrator (oh, it's HIM, not the Hamlet Cigar ad guy!) and quirky-homely Burton-Gothic mise-en-scene. The drama builds as one by one the tickets are found and, as the big day approaches, we are enchanted into becoming a vicarious golden ticket holder - just what ARE those mysteries and treasures within the world's largest chocolate factory? <br/><br/>If the tale has flaws then we can mostly look to the book: over-simplistic portrayal of the kids' behavioural traits, romanticising of Charlie's poverty (but they LOVE each other!) and Wonka's impunity for condemning an entire town to the dole queue... <br/><br/>But there are a few of Burton's own bad currants in the mix: Depp, although splendid in some respects, is characteristically overly-camp and childlike - an eccentric yet adultlike tour guide might have been more convincing; Helena-Bonham Carter is totally mis-cast - a slightly smudged face simply doesn't disguise her posh-ness; and, although explaining Willy's bizarre persona through his childhood is an interesting and contextualising insertion, I rather liked Mr Wonka as a mysterious figure... an unknown quantity. The riddle of a peculiar adult is endlessly fascinating to a child. <br/><br/>Overall however, I thoroughly enjoyed the film, went to the cinema three times to see it and, on one occasion, even felt compelled to visit London's fearfully expensive IMAX for the privilege."
"DavidSim240183","10","0","2","28 September 2005"," A welcome return to form for Tim Burton
","I just saw Charlie and the Chocolate Factory at the cinema today, and I couldn't believe how blown away I was. I haven't enjoyed a film this much at the cinema in years. Not just because it's a supremely entertaining film, but also because it marks a welcome return to form for Tim Burton. Burton's recent films of late (Planet of the Apes, Big Fish) have been very disappointing. With CATCF, Burton has returned to what he does best. Visually striking, eye-popping artwork.<br/><br/>When I heard Burton was doing his own version of CATCF, I was very excited. When it came to bringing the factory to life, I had total confidence in him. Assembly lines and bizarre contraptions are nothing new to Burton. He's been doing them since Pee Wee's Big Adventure and Edward Scissorhands.<br/><br/>But Johnny Depp playing the kooky Willy Wonka threw me for six. It's no secret that Depp is Burton's favourite actor to work with, perhaps because they share the same MO of avoiding the conventional, and going with the unusual.<br/><br/>But I couldn't see how anyone could ever hope to top Gene Wilder's wonderfully innovative performance. However, Johnny Depp turned out to be a pleasant surprise. But before I go into his introduction, I want to comment on the scenes before we see the factory.<br/><br/>CATCF has a wonderful opening title sequence. Bizarre machinery, conveyor belts that resemble roller coasters, all topped off with another excellent film score from Danny Elfman. Once we move to the action, we are introduced to Charlie Bucket (Freddie Highmore).<br/><br/>Anyone familiar with either the book or the original film knows Charlie comes from a poor family, but is a good-hearted boy. The ramshackle house his family lives in is classic Burton. Gloomy, on a slant, and dwarfed by the ominous Wonka factory.<br/><br/>The first half-hour gradually introduces us to the children, who will each find a Golden Ticket to get them into the Wonka factory. All the children are delightful in their own way. Freddie Highmore is a terrific young actor. He has a certain charm without ever becoming precocious.<br/><br/>The girl who plays Veruca Salt has a look of single-minded determination that's rather frightening on a child. Violet Beaureguarde is delightfully catty, Mike Teavee is an obnoxious brat, and Augustus Gloop knows exactly how to be a fat slob.<br/><br/>Once we get to the factory itself, it begins with a charming puppet show. What was surprising was it has the song from the trailer that I always found very irritating, but in the film it fits in perfectly, and when it is repeated on the end credits, I even hummed along to it.<br/><br/>Now we meet Johnny Depp's interpretation of Willy Wonka. A lot of people compare him to Michael Jackson. But I don't believe that. Willy Wonka is just another one of the oddball characters Tim Burton loves to have in his films. In fact he seems to be an amalgamation of a wide variety of different characters from a lot of Burton's films. The squeaky voice of Pee-wee Herman, the top hat of the Penguin, the child-like enthusiasm of Ed Wood, the pale skin of Edward Scissorhands and so on.<br/><br/>This new interpretation is decidedly more sinister than the original. The expressions on Wonka's face are priceless when the kids get their just desserts (get it!). You can guess exactly what is going through his mind. He couldn't care less what happens to these little brats. He even seems to relish it. With his darker clothes and top hat, he often reminded me of an undertaker. This is a more creepier Wonka for the 00's.<br/><br/>One thing I especially liked is this version is far more faithful to the book than the original. Veruca's encounter with the squirrels is the best example. How they trained all those squirrels is beyond me, but it's a marvel to behold when they all attack Veruca. It's nice to see Burton isn't getting lazy even after 20 years.<br/><br/>The Oompa Loompas are another achievement. Played by the actor Deep Roy, and digitally duplicated, the different musical numbers they perform are marvellously inventive (especially Mike Teavee's). Danny Elfman is really at the top of his game here. Using lyrics from the book, but combining them with his own quirky sensibilities, they are the best Elfman score I've heard in a Burton film since Pee Wee's Big Adventure.<br/><br/>Burton has also included a subplot regarding Wonka's estrangement from his father, Wilbur Wonka (Christopher Lee). I'm not sure if it was all that necessary, but at least it didn't bore me in the same way the father/son relationship did in Big Fish.<br/><br/>To sum up, CATCF is a dazzling achievement. Great songs, a surreal visual experience, and terrific performances from a fine ensemble cast made this into an extremely pleasurable viewing experience for me. Tim Burton has redeemed himself considerably in my eyes, and my respect for Johnny Depp grows with each film I see him in.<br/><br/>Bravo Tim!"
"Laitue_Gonflable","7","0","1","25 September 2005"," Sadly, a disappointment
","Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is a perfect example, for me at least, of a film that is, dare I use the word, 'overhyped'. And for once I'm not going to blame tinsel town and the media for doing this, but rather myself. I let myself look forward to this film so much; the book is one of my all-time favourites from childhood, the first film is also one of my favourite films of all time, and well, I couldn't imagine a better choice of person to direct a remake than Tim Burton.<br/><br/>And as so tragically often happens when you have expectations like this, they just weren't met. Admittedly I wasn't in a great mood going into the film since the morons at the box office neglected to tell me I'd be forced to sit down the front of the cinema due to a function involving a bunch of the rudest and worst-behaved kids (who incidentally can't have been much younger than me) taking up 80% of the seats and jabbering very loudly all the way through the film. But I digress, just needed to vent my spleen briefly.<br/><br/>Burton's take on the film is largely more faithful to the original text than Mel Stuart's film; there is no 'Slugworth' trying to steal everlasting gobstoppers, there IS a Mr. Bucket who screws caps onto toothpaste bottles for a living, and the Oompa-Loompa songs use Roald Dahl's original lyrics. However, the major focus for him is on the character of Willy Wonka, who is played with great gusto by Johnny Depp.<br/><br/>This focus is where Burton loses points for me. His intention seems to be to bring this eccentric genius out of enigma and give him a past; a life. And to do this he introduces a new character in Wonka's father, a strict, obsessively anal dentist who won't let the young Willy enjoy candy of any kind. What this is supposed to do is to explain the motivation behind Wonka's genius, his obsession with candy and, of course, his extremely bizarre behaviour.<br/><br/>In other words, the attempt is to make him less of a cardboard cutout. But while Burton does achieve this, it basically comes at the expense of practically every other character in the film. Part of the joy of the original book is that all the people in it are such delightfully over-the-top caricatures, Wonka included. And so by focussing such a large proportion of the film on only one of these caricatures, the other stereotypes - Gloop, Salt, Beauregard and Teevee - remain just that: stereotypes. Not only this but a substantial part of the story, where all these characters, is cut short to make room for all this extra plot line about Wonka's father, and frankly, the first half an hour feels extremely rushed. It's almost as though Tim Burton (or at least let's not leave out screenwriter John August) is saying to us ""Yes yes yes, we all know what happens with the golden tickets, now let's hurry up and get to my stroke of genius about Wilbur Wonka the dentist"". Grandpa Joe is also one of the characters who suffers for this, I feel. He doesn't come across quite as charmingly enthusiastic as I expected, largely because he doesn't have the screen time to do so.<br/><br/>Another criticism I had, and I daresay I may be regarded as a little unfair when I say this, but I really, REALLY don't care for Freddie Highmore's acting. He seems to have two modalities in which he can play - smiling cutely, or regurgitating lines as though he's reading them straight from the script. I found this with Finding Neverland and it's reinforced by him here. I mean, kudos to him and everything, he's only 13, but Charlie's presence was one element of the film I didn't mind being minimalised.<br/><br/>Having said these couple of criticisms, there is plenty to enjoy here of course. That was inevitable. Burton's visual flair is used to its maximum potential and you can tell that everybody involved would have had so much fun making this. It's also a good example of a remake simply because technologically it can go places the 1971 film wouldn't have dreamed of. Also, as I said, it does remain more faithful to the book and there are no teeth-gnashingly terrible ""Poor Charlie"" songs.<br/><br/>But of course the major winner here is Depp. As much as I would have liked more on the other characters, Wonka's character is just beautiful. He's basically just a camped-up weirdo but it's so much fun to watch. The grand opening of the factory doors was hilarious and was one of the highlights of an otherwise pretty ordinary year in cinema so far.<br/><br/>The most ironic thing is that when I first heard that Tim Burton was making a version of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, I loved absolutely everything about the idea, except for the fact that Depp was attached to play Wonka and I wasn't sure he could pull it off. But as it turned out, Depp's performance carries what could otherwise be pretty standard material.<br/><br/>In a nutshell, then? Disappointing, but certainly not bad. 7 out of 10."

","This movie was going along pretty well, until, that is, Johnny Depp enters the picture. I just don't know why Tim Burton allowed him to give this horrible performance. First of all, his perfectly white teeth: very creepy. They looked like dentures. Okay, I understand where the idea came from: his father was a dentist and he was forced to wear head gear during his childhood, which, looks more like a torture instrument, but okay, fine. But they were creepy, and not in a good way. Plus how did Wonka go from a fairly normal-seeming kid, albeit wearing giant headgear, to this bizarre, make-up wearing guy with a Lord Fauntleroy haircut and Michael Jackson-like lipstick? And did anyone else notice that he sounded just like Dustin Hoffman as Tootsie? Same inflection in his voice. I like the photography in the movie; I liked the fact that the movie explained Willy Wonka a bit more, and the flashbacks were well-done, but the other negatives were the fact that the gold ticket winners were exact replicas of the originals, so that there was nothing original there, and the Oompa Loompas, oh, no! Almost unwatchable. The same man multiplied appearing in leather or pleather outfits of various colors, singing practically unsustainable songs to explain the moral of whatever happens to each child. I think the movie had potential but it just veered off course horribly."

Was that Willy Wonka is exactly as Michael Jackson. He does what he never could as a kid, and he is, when you think about it, almost as weird as Jackson about his lost childhood/candy eating. Talking like a kid, nothing have to make sense, and he just loves everything that has to do with candy. He invites small children over for a look at the chocolate empire of his. This is not meant in a negative way. The resemblance was too obvious for me to even try to ignore. The movie was GREAT.

","Don't get me wrong, I was so excited when I initially saw the preview for this movie. I grew up on the original Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory and what made me so pleased about this version was the fact that it looked so different and so original.<br/><br/>Not all of this film was bad, either. I did find the part with the squirrels incredibly funny, as well as Wonka's introduction to the children. I thought the children themselves were very strong performers as well, especially Philip Wiegratz as Augustus. The fact that their characters were a little more fleshed out was also a nice touch. Sadly, that's where the positives of the film end.<br/><br/>My first major problem was with Johnny Depp. I think Depp is a great actor, but his Willy Wonka was more reminiscent of a thirteen year old work experience kid than the eccentric candymaker who revolutionised chocolate. The way Charlie and Grandpa Joe regarded him in awe seemed completely unjustified, because it never was convincing that he created all the bizarre inventions that were depicted so well. I also found his backstory completely irrelevant and annoying. The Oompa Loompas were disappointing as well, with no charm or fascination. I couldn't understand anything they were singing, which is a shame because Dahl's little poems were very funny.<br/><br/>What irritated me so much was that Burton claimed that this version was so much closer to the book, when in fact it was completely corrupted. The original story about a group of unpleasant children being punished in horribly appropriate ways was completely pushed to one side to make room for a theme about family, which relied solely on a little backstory and a few minutes of resolution. The end result is a plot that distracts from the theme, and a theme that distracts from the plot. What makes this even more frustrating is the sugar coated message that is all but hammered into the audience's heads. I can remember being utterly terrified when I watched the original at six and having to hide behind the couch more than once. Yet, despite the dark nature of the movie, I loved it. Every time I put it in the VCR, I would feel a tingle of excitement that came from knowing that I would be scared out of my wits. Kids aren't as fragile as you might think and to give them just another happy message as this movie does accomplishes nothing. It's just like every other kid's movie made and as such will probably not appeal to them in any way. It also goes against the whole nature of Dahl's dark and horrible method of storytelling. I very much doubt this film will stand the test of time as the original does, purely because it fails to distinguish itself in any way.<br/><br/>Really, you're far better off watching the 1970s version. Just make sure that you have a couch you can hide behind."

","I'm a huge Tim Burton fan, I think he's visually brilliant, and I generally tip my hat to Johhny Depp for sheer audacity alone, but I have to regretfully acknowledge that watching this film was not what I would call a pleasant experience by any stretch (no pun intended).<br/><br/>It was OK during the set-up, when we meet Charlie (the perfectly cast Freddie Highmore) and his maniacally eccentric family - the film actually works while we're all waiting to see how Charlie's going to become one of the five supposedly lucky souls who finds the all-important Golden Ticket and gets to visit - moment of reverential silence - The Factory. But soon as Depp shows up, looking like a deranged cross between Jane Fonda, Billy Crystal and Faye Dunaway, it's downhill all the way, unfortunately. I never thought I would agree with the people who had said there were parallels between this version of Wonka and Michael Jackson, but these people were sadly on the money: here we have an emotionally crippled character, damaged from childhood, who becomes the antithesis of everything his father stood for, the ultimate act of neurotic rebellion in full force. To his credit, by the third act, Wonka realizes he's monumentally dysfunctional, which is cemented in a retardedly demented Oompa Loompa therapy session.<br/><br/>And let's talk about these Oompa Loompas - they're undeniably creepy by any standards, let's face it, and the musical numbers become more psychotic as the scenario goes on. I was thinking about three fourths of the way through that I needed some serious drugs to properly appreciate this movie, I mean the endorphins released by mere chocolate unfortunately were hardly enough to cut the proverbial mustard."

","Tim Burton has a terrible habit of taking good ideas, promising big, and once again failing to deliver. I would dare to suggest that most of the people who 'love' this film have no real knowledge of the original book and film and would probably turn up to an ad break if they knew Johnny Depp was starring in it! Unlike the original film, this chocolate factory is all colour and movement but completely lacking in charm. Is there any anticipation, any excitement, any climax? No - once the first kid disappears it's simply a matter of counting down the numbers........oh, and now we're down to one - yawn. Is there any good acting, any twist in the plot, any suspense at all? Not really -Depp relys on his talent, luckily, the script and Wonka character are awful. The ghastly children have little appeal (except maybe Mike Teavee) and not one classic line to be heard....""Daddy, I want an oompa loompa!"" There was no Slugworth - the everlasting gobstopper which played such an important role in the first film barely rated a mention in this version - no fizzy lifting drink (the new Charlie doesn't steal). Wacky distractions and a subplot involving Wonkas' childhood spoil the flow and were completely unnecessary - this film reeked of 'Hollywood License'......... and it could have been so good!"

","Johnny Depp, Freddie Highmore, and David Kelly star in Tim Burton's remake of the classic book by Roald Dahl. Seven lucky children and one guardian are allowed into Willy Wonka's candy factory where all his great chocolate creations are made. Blah, blah, blah as if we haven't heard it before. Might I say that for a movie to attempt to reach the level of success the first movie made is alone, insane. Then to fail to do such adds a certain level of disappointment. But for this all to come from the brilliant director Tim Brton who brought us the classic, A Nightmare Before Christmas, is really a sad sight. But aside from the negatives of this over-all let-down, any movie that stars Johnny Depp as the lead and dresses him up and makes him talk funny is going to be at least an average movie. And Burton's twist on Dahl's ending is pretty good."
"evanston_dad","6","0","3","6 September 2005"," Depp Nearly Ruins It
","I usually like Johnny Depp's quirky approach to characters and credit him for making many films much better than they had any right being, but for once his instincts are off. In Tim Burton's new take on the classic children's story, he nearly derails the film with his weird, creepy interpretation of candy empresario Willy Wonka.<br/><br/>It's not that I was comparing this to the Gene Wilder original; I didn't much like that version either (though I liked Wilder's performance more) and thought Roald Dahl's book was due for a retry. And in the first 20 minutes, leading up to the day actually spent in the chocolate factory, Burton nails Dahl's story just right. In many ways it's a perfect matching of artist and source material, and the cordial relationship shows for a while. But once Depp enters the picture, Burton gives him free reign to walk away with it, but I didn't like where he took it.<br/><br/>People have said Depp reminds them of both Carol Burnett and Michael Jackson. Throw Carol Channing and Frances McDormand from ""Fargo"" into the mix and you get a pretty good idea of how he plays the character. The thing is, the writers screwed up big time in giving Wonka so much back story and making him a character that begs for redemption. The great thing about Wonka in the book was that he wasn't explained; he was a candy genius, his life was devoted to making great candy, end of story. The point Dahl was making was about proper ways for children to behave, not about reconnecting with your family, father/son relationships, blah, blah, blah. Dahl's book was perfection, so why mess with it? Other than the awful additions, however, this film stays much truer to the book than the 1971 version. There are some great songs by Danny Elfman for the Oompah-Loompahs to perform, the bad kids are deliciously bratty, and Freddie Highmore is really winning as Charlie. Maybe in another 30 years they'll try to adapt this book again and get it right. Or people could just stop trying to make movies of the book and (gasp!) actually read it instead.<br/><br/>Grade: B-"

","Anyone who saw the original with Gene Wilder as Wonka, will wonder what Tim Burton and his team were thinking. Yes, Depp was weird weird weird as Wonka, but where did all that extra stuff come from that just made Wonka fruit-cake material and digressed from the actual storyline ... am I wrong or is this movie called ""CHARLIE"" and the chocolate factory. Charlie was not the main focus, and I am disappointed. There was a lot of glossing over parts that I considered quite relevant to the entire point of the story - everyone who's read the book knows that Charlie is poor, he desperately wants the ticket, and that the other children are not as deserving as he is of the ""grand prize"". Glossing over these pertinent points and adding lots of wacky wonka weirdness sort of detracts from the expectations one holds of seeing a wonderful Roald Dahl book come to the big screen. I guess Tim Burton was so excited about the river of chocolate he forgot that half the movie, at least, is about CHARLIE. Tsk, Tsk."

","Even from when I was a little girl in pyjamas and clutching a teddy called Edward, I've loved Tim Burton. He made even the scariest of childhood nightmares magical and with a little sprinkle of that Tim Burton magic dust he made, for me at least, the screen come alive. At around five I saw Edwards Scissorhands, my first run in with Burton. And I admit, I had quite the crush on Mr. Scissorhands himself! All my bears were called Edward and had paper talons selotaped to their paws, thus resulting in me getting paper cuts during the nights - but I didn't care;I was young and in love. At the dawn of my 18th birthday, Charlie and the Chocolte Factory returns to our screens. Bigger, brighter and a wee bit more sinister than the 70s version, Willy Wonkas Chocolate Factory. Burton returns to magical form directing this very, very good film. For those of you who'll have not been living in a cave for the past 40 or so years, you'll know the story. Chalie Bucket is a poor little boy who lives in a fabulously crooked house with wonky doors, crazy windows and equally crazy grandparents. Despite his lack of money, little Charlie loves his parents more than most, and it seems that this is his enduring feature that ultimately lets him win the final golden ticket. No surprises there. The magic really starts when Charlie and his grandfather (his chosen guardian, bless him!) enter the factory. The first time we come face to face with Johnny Depp, as the great chocolatier is, in itself a great bit of cinematography. Hilariously funny and ever-so-slightly creepy. As you follow the sticky demises of the 4 other golden ticket winners, you begin to be rooting for these children's deaths! Harsh I know, but they're all so horribly spoilt, fat, rude and violent-obsessed that you want them to be taught a lesson! As with all films like these, alls well that ends well, but not without a little bit of trouble, of course! As always Burton delivers his great adventure of a film very well indeed, helped along enormously by Mr. Depp and the brilliant Freddie Highmore as little Charlie Bucket. The other kiddies are brilliant too. All in all a fantastic family film that anyone can enjoy. No-matter what age you pretend to be!"

","I had come to the theater hoping for a dark remake of the 1971 movie. Instead, I found a lighter version that barely touches upon the original movie, let alone the book. Burton's version of Wonka was pretty much a Michael Jackson/Howard Hughes carbon copy. In Wonka's flashbacks, the braces and headgear were slightly funny, seeing as I am about to get braces. However, some parts of the movie were quite questionable. In some quotes, there were discreet sexual references-""Little boy, don't push my button!"" and ""Don't touch that squirrel's nut! It'll make him crazy!"" Also, some parts got pretty tiring when they were repeated, such as Wonka crashing into the Great Glass Elevator twice. In conclusion, this movie is okay, but Tim Burton can do better than this."

"NoArrow","7","0","1","29 August 2005"," A Burton film
","Tim Burton's ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" is, like all of Burton's films, so visually delightful that the plot almost doesn't matter. This can make and break a film; sometimes Burton can undermine the importance of his story with the quirkiness of how it looks, like with ""Edward Scissorhands"". But his best films (""Sleepy Hollow"" and ""Big Fish"") marry the visuals and the plot, so that the two work together to create an even flow for the movie.<br/><br/>I'd say ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" almost succeeds at that, but there are times when it feels like we're looking at post cards from the infamous factory. The film, like the original ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"", is about a poor boy (Freddie Highmore) who wins a contest and travels with four other kids into the mysterious Wonka Chocolate Factory, run by the even-more-mysterious Willy Wonka (Johnny Depp). From there on in, it's an adventure through the many bizarre - and sometimes surreal - departments of the factory.<br/><br/>In the original, Willy Wonka was played by Gene Wilder in a mostly straight performance that channeled the witty, cane-twirling comedians of the thirties. Here Depp does carry a cane, but he does no twirling, and the performance is far from straight. His Willy Wonka is a mix of Michael Jackson and a Barbie doll, and grows more unnecessarily confusing as the movie goes on. It's not exactly a bad performance, but it does feel like Depp's parading his versatility. I think he should have toned it down a little, and gone for the innocence of his Sam character from ""Benny & Joon"".<br/><br/>The movie is not a misfire, as it has many good aspects. Freddie Highmore is excellent as Charlie, he is believably earnest. In fact, all of the child actors are pretty good. Most of the adult ones seem a little understated, impressive that they let the children take the foreground. David Kelly shines as Charlie's Grandpa Joe, giving probably the best and funniest performance in the movie - why hasn't this guy been a star for the past few decades? The Oompa Loompas are all played by Deep Roy, who manages to be creepier than those in the seventies version, who were orange with green hair. When you think about it, Roy's performance is tremendously complicated, as he had to move in synchronization with himself thousands of times.<br/><br/>Occasionally the movie gets lost in itself, raising questions that are never answered. Near the beginning Grandpa Joe tells an anecdote about Wonka's building a chocolate castle for an Indian prince. I was interested in seeing how this fitted into the story later on, but that's just it: it didn't. It seems to be just a comment on the film's own special effects. What Burton needs to learn is that it's mostly dangerous to remind his viewer's that they're watching a movie.<br/><br/>The plot is also a little too similar to the first's, it never really throws any new curves at us, we know exactly what to expect (though, curiously, the magical floating bubbles scene from the original is missing).<br/><br/>In short, it relies a little too much on Depp's performance and the set design - it seems Charlie and Grandpa Joe are almost forgotten when they enter the factory. But it's not boring, if predictable, and it's interesting to look at, and Depp's performance is intriguing, if not fitting.<br/><br/>Come on, it's a Burton film.<br/><br/>7.5/10"

","While there were a few twists in the movie, and some additional scenes in comparison to the older 'Willy Wonka and the Cholcolate Factory', the movie was quite boring. The ooompaa looompaas don't sing their cool little songs, and apart from Willy bashing into his glass elevator occasionally, nothing else exciting really happens. You do get to see what happens to the other 4 children who are ""eliminated"" from winning by their bad manners, and the movie provides a role model for young children about family values. This movie would be aimed at young children because of the morals, but at the same time I doubt that many would enjoy it because of its dullness. My recommendation is to give it a miss unless you see it for sale at a very cheap price."

"psi_fla","Null","0","1","22 August 2005"," Burton is his own worst enemy
","Numerous people, including Roald Dahl himself, felt that his highly regarded children's classic, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, was poorly treated in its first filmic interpretation. Mel Stuart's 1971 film (which went as far as being named after Willy Wonka) was indeed flawed and sometimes cringeworthy, yet it has numerous original and endearing moments that leave a lasting impression. Enough, in fact, to make it a cult classic.<br/><br/>But that hasn't stopped the detractors complaining. So with so many remakes around these days, why not at least try and put things right? And who better to do so than Tim Burton, that strange and interesting director who has given us a handful of mini classics in the past? He understands Roald Dahl better than anyone else, or so it seems.<br/><br/>Now, for the few of you who don't know, the story revolves around the enormous chocolate factory of the reclusive Willy Wonka (Johnny Depp). No one has seen him for years, and he has suddenly decided to invite five children - just five, and no more - to accompany him on a tour of the factory itself. Charlie Bucket (Freddie Highmore), despite his poor conditions, never stops hoping that he will be one of those five. But even he cannot imagine what surprises lie in store for him.<br/><br/>Like The Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy before it, everything seems set up for a wonderful modern film adaptation. There's so much acting talent (Johnny Depp, relative newcomer Freddie Highmore, Helena Bonham-Carter, Edward Fox, Noah Taylor, Christopher Lee), so much wonderful production design (courtesy of Alex McDowell, who did an equally impressive job for Minority Report) and numerous brilliant moments. And yet...and yet...it all feels so rehearsed. There's a lack of spontaneity, there's little feeling. As Shakespeare would put it, it's ""all sound and fury, signifying nothing."" Let me make it clear that I love the book. As a result, one of the things I personally found dissatisfying about Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory was its tendency to leave out many of the book's classic early moments. Burton and screenwriter John August overcome this flaw by ignoring the earlier film and successfully re-imagining some of the best scenes in the book in their own right. Unfortunately, these scenes are all too literally replicated, so while fans of the book will be happy to see them, they lack inspiration and leave little to the imagination. Which, it should be said, was one of the key themes of the original story.<br/><br/>I could also argue that the pre-chocolate factory section of the film is rather rushed. This is more costly than you'd expect, and it leaves us with a poorly written leading protagonist. Freddie Highmore does his best with Charlie, but there is little in the film that suggests he will become the truly deserving winner of the prize that Wonka has in store for his favourite child.<br/><br/>The arrival of Johnny Depp enlivens things immensely. Twenty minutes inside the factory with this guy, and I thought ""He makes Gene Wilder look sane."" Unfortunately, Depp's fantastic performance is hampered by Burton's interference, in the form of childhood flashbacks for Wonka. These may be innovative, but they are distracting and forced. It's as if Burton felt he had to justified to give Wonka a personality, when really he should have let Depp do most of the work. (Pretty much in the same way Gore Verbinski did in Pirates Of The Caribbean.) Roald Dahl managed to find the correct balance of pathos and irreverence in Wonka; neither Mel Stuart nor Tim Burton have been able to do so. It's a shame.<br/><br/>Of course, those who have come along just to see their favourite book faithfully and stylishly recreated, with a few twists here and there (and these include the way Burton has staged the Oompa Loompas' songs) won't be disappointed. It even appears, at one point, that he has given the film a remarkable ending; unfortunately, the film ends up closing with a poorly handled, overly moralistic sermon on ""family values"", that is jarring in the context of the film.<br/><br/>So there you have it. For all that Tim Burton does right with this film, he misses an opportunity. And thus we have another ""Hitchhiker's Guide"" - enjoyable, but could and should have been much, much more.<br/><br/>Rating: 6/10"

","First of all I should say that I saw the movie 3 times. That's how much I loved it. <br/><br/>Now I don't want my opinion to be biased because of my love for Tim Burton, Johnny Depp, and chocolate, so I will be quite honest with you.<br/><br/>Movie Flow: The beginning starts out slow...until we are introduced to the children who win the golden tickets. Augustus Gloop has a very funny accent, Violet Beauregarde's mother is a hysterically typical soccer mom, Mike Teavee bring familiarity to parents because he never leaves the video game screen, and Veruca Salt's spoiling father and martini-downing mother are great too. When the children get to the factory gates is when the movie's pace picks up and keeps going at a good speed. Movie flow gets an A-<br/><br/>Acting: Johnny Depp's eccentric portrayal of Willy Wonka blew me away. His tone, facial expressions, and body language are all perfectly combined. Unlike the old Willy Wonka, (played by Gene Wilder) Johnny Depp's version is a bit more childish and even feminine, and his voice is much different. Johnny gives Willy a smallish voice, and throws a bunch of ""ew""'s and ""teehee""'s in his dialog to play up his childishness. Most people couldn't pull this kind of dialect off without sounding whiny and annoying, but Johnny does it in a way that's charming, a bit eerie, and very funny. The acting of the children impressed me too. Especially Freddie Highmore's take on Charlie. He had just the right homeliness and kindness to make his character warm and fuzzy, but did not give an annoyingly cutesy vibe. Acting gets an A<br/><br/>Visuals: The first thing to say about these visuals is that they make the original version look like it was made on a ten dollar budget. I mean these visuals were AWESOME. Especially the Great Glass Elevator ride. When we got to see the factory rooms from the Elevator, it was just stunning. And in the boat ride scene I felt like I was on a ride at Disney World! A+ hands down.<br/><br/>Oompa Loompas: I was never a fan of the Oompa Loompas in the original, but I do prefer them to the new ones. No doubt about it the new ones were hilarious when doing their songs for each child's demise, but I didn't think they fit well with the movie. They were 30 inch Middle-Eastern men with swirly black hair. I was expecting more imaginable things that didn't look so much like real people who were simply shrunken down with a computer. These Oompas get a B-, but their funny songs get an A.<br/><br/>Overall: This is a great movie overall despite some scenes stuck in that I think were not needed. Although it wasn't as dark and twisted as I would have hoped, (being a Tim Burton film) this new version definitely is more funnier and visually rewarding than the first one, and Johnny Depp as Wonka is the icing on a very sweet movie."

Despite being a PG this film has rather dark undertones, but a lot of humour. I felt that Charlie Bucket was slightly disappointing - a bit pious possibly - but this did not ruin the wonderfulness of the film. I felt its ending slightly let it down, but I was particularly pleased with how closely it followed the book for most of it.<br/><br/>A brilliant film I would love to go see again!"

","Well, the story is definitely made for Tim Burton: fairy-tale, sweetie-sweet, mystery-fantasy-strange... A few years ago he made movies like this one - but they were sweet ironic biting ones.<br/><br/>The conservative moral attitude in ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" is perhaps a work of the bad Bush age but also may be a part of the original story (or both). Four of the five kids are representing four of the seven mortal sins; the last one of the kids - well, the protagonist - is a boy who knows when to have to shut up, loves his wimpy parents and moronic grandparents, lives in a ramshackle hut,... here we have a really loser - but he will win the game. Yeah - thats America...<br/><br/>""Well Mr. Burton - we will give you as much money as you need for your 'Corpse Bride'. But only, if you also directs our new 'Charlie'."" Perhaps this is the answer to my questions. But there are some mysteries for me. As example: What did Willy Wonka mean with ""Good morning, starshine... the earth says hello""? And what about the pink sheep?? Hidden messages, little jokes on the producers, the last remains of subtle irony... I unfortunately do not understand.<br/><br/>Well this movie is a part of the conservative zeitgeist. But aside from this I enjoyed the movie much.

Johnny Depp, a great actor, portrayed Willy Wonka perfectly, with the perfect dosage of creepiness, humor, and craziness. Julia Winter was great as the wonderfully spoiled Veruca Salt, and Jordan Fry as the super arrogant Mike Teavee.

The good things are related to the quality of the visuals, of course.

"trypanophobic34","3","0","2","16 August 2005"," Not absolutely dreadful but quite unfortunate...
","I don't know why Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is receiving so much praise, apart from the fact that it brings Tim Burton, Danny Elfman, and Johnny Depp together again, as well as being based on the long-loved story by Roald Dahl and preceded by Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory. Because of this latter reason, it was guaranteed a certain amount of success and bound to draw fans of either the old movie or book, or both. Because of the former reason, it was also guaranteed a healthy measure of success and fans of either Tim Burton, Danny Elfman, Johnny Depp, or all three. I'll tell you why it doesn't deserve praise: Most of the time, it's just plain boring. It started off well, with sweet little Charlie and his family in their quaint, lopsided hut; they obviously suffer from indigence and Sickeningly Sweet Syndrome. Everyone is kind and loving and selfless and supportive of each other, etc. etc., and it's all quite corn-fed, but that's all fine and well; it can only be expected. Grandma Bucket with her ""I love grapes"" line was even funny and endearing. The movie begins to go downhill after the discoverer of the first Golden Ticket, that rotund German boy, is shown.<br/><br/>The plot is all too predictable. You knew from the start that Willy Wonka hated all the children and their parents except Charlie and Grandpa Bucket, and that the rest of the movie would consist in him knocking them off one by one, until only Charlie & Co. were left. That's all it was really about; the process of elimination. While we're on the subject of elimination, what the hell did Willy Wonka get rid of that angry video game child for, being smart and making comments to which Wonka had no reply? Indeed, he made the only solid point of the movie in saying, ""Why is everything here so pointless?"" I know that it's a children's movie, but they could at least mix things up a bit so you don't find yourself reminded of preschool shows on TV, such as Dora the Explorer or Blues Clues, which feature cyclical journeys.<br/><br/>Speaking of young audiences, the movie was childish. Yes, yes, it's a children's movie, but it was childish even for a children's movie. I know that I found even Edward Scissorhands a bit childish, but I liked it anyway for its charms. And I like Tim Burton, don't get me wrong, but does he think everything a happy dark fairy tale? Nothing's ever that complex in his films; he relies more on visuals and a sort of magical atmosphere.<br/><br/>Speaking of visuals, I wasn't all that impressed by those in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. I thought the seahorse-shaped boat they rode in down the chocolate river looked particularly fake; like cheap plastic, really. None of the scenery was spectacular. I didn't like how near the beginning, when they were introducing the four other children who found a Golden Ticket, their skin and features were so obviously computer-""enhanced"" that they looked cartoonish. Not to nitpick.<br/><br/>A more major thing is that I didn't like the character of Willy Wonka himself, which is like a fatal stroke in the world of film. You have to like the main characters, or at least approve of them to some degree, to appreciate a movie, and Willy Wonka was just rude, hypocritically judgmental, lacking in depth and complexity (the whole ""I have flashbacks of being traumatized by my father"" thing didn't cut it), and - forgive me - dorky. Not quirky in a good way. I didn't even like the way he looked or that exceedingly silly haircut he had. He said nothing very interesting or that would make me take more kindly to him throughout the movie. None of the other characters were great/engaging or very well-played, either, including Charlie and Grandpa Bucket.<br/><br/>The Oompa Loompas' several songs celebrating the riddance of each child were annoying, seemed to be added simply to kill time, and only drew your notice more sharply to the cyclical, repetitive nature of the plot. I wanted them to shut their minuscule, identical noise tubes.<br/><br/>Last of all but not least, it didn't leave me with a ""warm, fuzzy feeling inside"" as might be expected. There didn't seem to be any moral to it, except perhaps, ""Candy doesn't need to have a point, and neither does this movie, apparently,"" or, ""If you're a poor, goody-goody child, all your dreams will come true because you'll get to inherit a chocolate factory full of magical goodies, not because of any talent or ambition but simply because you're the least spoiled of five randomly selected children who all like to eat chocolate."" There was no real bond between Wonka and Charlie, as might also be expected, and, like I said, there's nothing special or particularly warming about Willy Wonka. There's no ""magic"" to the movie as there is to other Burton films. It leaves you only dissatisfied and feeling very much like you have just seen it exactly for what it is, nothing more: nothing memorable. It has no heart or vivacity in it, and that is probably why, above all else, it falls flat.<br/><br/>That being said, I'm sure you'll have a lovely time at the theater with your kid(s)/spouse/friend(s)/yourself, enjoying the pointlessness and vapidity that is Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.<br/><br/>It's okay to watch. Really. Just don't expect anything special or heart-warming or graphically fabulous. I'm sure little kids won't even notice the difference. I felt impelled to write this heavily negative comment only because: 1) it's my actual opinion, and 2) I was seeing all positive comments about how delightful this little movie is.<br/><br/>3) And yes, I am a cynical bitch. It's not touching, heart-warming, or sincere, yet still very corny, and I demand to have my cold heart thawed and de-barbed by happy children's movies, I say!"
"meganaway","6","0","2","14 August 2005"," oversimplified, lacking memorable scenes
","Minuses <br/><br/>1) To me this story seemed like a remake of The Grinch Stole Christmas or one of the Home Alones (surely an insult to Dahl's work)! Wonka has all these repressive psychological issues (bipolar, peter pan disease, passive aggressive.) that make him bitter and heartless and which are resolved by a child at the end who encourages him to face his fears<br/><br/>""And what happened then...? Well...in Who-ville they say That the Grinch's small heart Grew three sizes that day!""<br/><br/>it was a cheesy ending, you could see Wonka's heart turn from gray to pink, nothing to do with the novel which Burton said he was remaking..<br/><br/>2) His speech was annoying. I'm still trying to figure out what they mixed this together and why. Perhaps it's mid-west American 11 year old boy? ""K?"" Why?<br/><br/>3) Because Gene Wilder already interpreted Wonka so we have something to compare Depp to, overall Depp's interpretation was really bad. He's far too simplified. there's no coherency to his character. I would have to re-read the book to see if Wonka was so idiotic and simple, I highly doubt it. Wilder was a complicated complete mature individual, one in which when you they referred to Gene/Wonka as a genius, is was believable. Depp/Wonka is more like the 4 children that are eliminated, simple stereotyped personas.<br/><br/>4) the same goes for the children with the exception of Charlie who was very good. In the '71 they are presented as more complete individuals, here they are over-simplified, over-brattified, whose morality and destiny are presented in super-easily recognizable North American 10 year old cultural codes. All four of the eliminated children are, in a sense, the same. is there any difference, for example, between Violet and Veruca? and their parents? not in Burton's interpretation. perhaps with the exception of Mrs. Beauregarde, the rest of the parents were pretty much same non-memorable junk, yes even Grandpa Joe.<br/><br/>5) a major disappointment: the setting/the factory was far too gray and metallic. It looked like it was designed by the Tin Man. This is a chocolate factory?!?! It looks and smells like a NASA plant. Accordingly, the chocolate room was a disappointment, there wasn't even any introduction to the room, they just go in it like its no big deal. The invention room, the elevatorthe aesthetics of everything in the factory were disappointing, more appalling than appetizing. I mean the magnificent everlasting gobstopper and the meal-gum don't even have a color. The '71 factory (especially the chocolate room, one of film's best scenes ever) makes you drool in amazement, this one left me with nothing but an aluminum taste in my mouth.<br/><br/>At the beginning of the movie when you can see the gray exterior of the factory, I was excited because I was certain that the banal exterior was going to be used to contrast with a colorful intriguing interior, but, nope.<br/><br/>6) the songs the oompas sang were terrible!!!! totally ruins the Elfman soundtrack.<br/><br/>7) resurrection of the 4 children at the end in funny-form. this is silly and no doubt was requested by the HHIC (Holy Hollywood Inquisition Censorers) who would not approve of children disappearing in a chocolate factory.<br/><br/>8) the sequence of first half of the film is too choppy which spoils the excitement that could be provoked with a bit of fluidity and anticipation. for example, they go from outside of the factory to inside too fast, the same goes for the immediate cut into the chocolate room.<br/><br/>Pluses<br/><br/>1) The whole Postmodern technological (with the exception of the outer space grayness) ambiance of the film. The hodgepodge of styles, English/American accents, architecture, and the fragmentation/confusion of (virtual) space effectively brings the story to the hodgepodge 21st century and shows the novels near-universality in terms of time and space.<br/><br/>2) All remakes will slightly derivate from the original. In this case, we have the whole father dentist issue, reminisces of Edward Scissohand memories with his father. I thought this fit very well with the storyline but wasn't worth sacrificing a strong magnificent Wonka for a wimpy one with childhood issues who can't mutter the word ""parents.""<br/><br/>3) Burton did a good job at interpreting Dahl's critical candyfied-Marx discourse on the social classes, particularly ""the mass"", the factory worker, the repetitive oppressive job, a person as just one part of an enormous money machine, the evil alienation qualities of money, the rich being snotty, greedy, self-centeredetc. in fact the town they live in looks like Manchester. (Hence proving the depth of the novel, that it's not just for kids.)<br/><br/>4) there are some mysterious scenes/gestures of uncertainty (which is an important theme in Dahl's work), not as many as in the '71, but there are some. Like when they're talking about the gobstoppers, some strange looks are exchanged, or the fact that we don't know if the children's' accidents are improvised or not, Mrs. Beauregarde's response after Wonka mentions the endorphins in the chocolate...<br/><br/>I give the film 6/10. It will be difficult for this film to succeed when you have the '71 film, a masterpiece novel, and critical life-long fans of both to compete with. Overall, the film lacked complete characters and memorable scenes. It was fun to watch, but made me treasure the '71 film even more."

","I know everyone's focus is on who is the better Willy, but I'd just like to comment about Grandpa Joe. In my opinion, there was absolutely no one that could be better in that role than Jack Albertson. He was just so endearing, you could picture him being your own grandpa. Anyone agree/disagree? As for Willy, nothing could possibly be better than the original, but I equally enjoyed the remake. I feel like all the people criticizing it are taking it way too seriously. It's just a fun-loving movie, and if you hate the 2nd one and love the 1st one, just watch the 1st and not the 2nd. :) I saw someone else's comment that you couldn't really understand the words in the Oompa Loompa songs, and I would have to agree. I loved the music, but I would have enjoyed it much more if the music didn't overpower the words so you couldn't hear. Oh yea, one more thing, the whole storyline about Willy's childhood was pretty strange, but very Tim Burton-esqe. I did appreciate seeing Christopher Lee, he's a classic actor that was absolutely perfect in that sadistic role. :)"

The kids in the movie seemed to never scream when they were put into horrific situations. The parents stared blankly watching their kids suffer, no believable reactions. The rides that these people were on, like the elevator, boat, etc...never seemed to make the people sway or move..they stood still like they were statues, again no screams. Just not a good movie. I'm glad I saw it for curiosity sake. Will not rent it or buy it when it comes out. I am wondering how this movie is getting such rave reviews?!"
"gglennwill","5","0","2","13 August 2005"," Fancier than the Original Without the Heart
","Tim Burton's version of ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" certainly is fancier than the earlier version that starred Gene Wilder. The special effects are better, the music is hilarious, it seems a bit glitzier. There is only one problem; it lacks the heart of the original movie. It almost seemed to me that Tim Burton was more determined to make fun of the story instead of respecting it and it's message of goodness vs. selfishness, etc. To me, Gene Wilder is a much better Willy Wonka than Johnny Depp. Johnny Depp seemed too weird, almost like Michael Jackson. I could relate to the boy much more in the earlier version, and Jack Albertson was more believable than the boys relatives are in this film. The film does have its moments; the other kids are played terrifically, the special effects are terrific. The music routines were especially funny.<br/><br/>To sum it up, this film's strength is also it's weakness; the humor, while providing moments of hilarity, also leaves one with a sense of shallowness, as though there is nothing in the story that is a serious message. I'll take the original film over this one, thank you."
"jon.h.ochiai","8","0","1","13 August 2005"," A lot of Tim Burton
","A little of Tim Burton goes a long way. In his ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" there is a lot of Director Tim Burton. There are about two too many Oompa Loompa song and dance numbers-- which have the analogous effect of riding Disneyland's ""It's a Small World"" in rapid succession. ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" is dark, macabre, absurd, and wacky. Talking with my bud, Ron, who is a fan of the Roald Dahl novel, Burton navigates closely by the book, a lot in spirit. John August's adaptation of the novel, is strange and at times overly stilted-- the children other than Charlie (wonderfully embodied by Freddie Highmore) are dreadful and for the most part despicable. Eventually August veers back toward the conventional ending, which worked for me at least. Johnny Depp's character turn near the end as Willy Wonka also returns us to the world of human beings. Charlie Bucket (Highmore) catches Willy Wonka's attention saying, ""Candy doesn't have a point. That's what makes it candy."" However, a movie should have a point, even if it is about that childhood romantic quality. With Highmore's Charlie we get that, and the value of family.<br/><br/>Depp steers the course on this very weird journey. In the beginning, I did not know what to make of Depp's Wonka. He seems to be doing a walk-through, playing a caricature of Michael Jackson sans the problematic legal creepiness. His Wonka is basically Peter Pan, who has an incomplete and unresolved relationship with his dentist father, Dr. Wonka (well played by Christopher Lee). Willy Wonka, chocolate magnate, being the son of a dentist is a great touch by August. Wonka's flashbacks to his youth are absurd, and Depp balances all this playing it straight up. Only at the end does he reveal Wonka's human vulnerability, with a light touch and wacky edge. Depp is an amazing and versatile actor.<br/><br/>I was interested in Burton's ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"", because it reunited Depp and Highmore. They had magical chemistry in ""Finding Neverland"". ""Finding Neverland"" is an entirely different kind of movie; however, they are also wonderful here. Highmore's Charlie Bucket lives in a broken down home with his parents (Helena Bonham Carter and Noah Tayllor), and both sets of grandparents. They are poor, and they are happy together. Willy Wonka announces to the world that he will open his world famous Chocolate Factory for a personal tour to the lucky five people who find a golden ticket hidden in the wrapper of his chocolate bars. Charlie finds the last ticket, and he and his Grandpa Joe (David Kelly) are among those to meet Willy Wonka. The other kids are despicable and annoying, and their parents are even more so. Perhaps, that is a message. This may almost be a miscalculation given the contest subtext of the story. All the other kids are so bad, and Charlie is a really good kid. Burton provides a visually stunning fantasy world inside the Chocolate Factory, even if there are two too many Oompa Loompa numbers. None the less, it is worth sticking out the over-the-top Burton for the end.<br/><br/>Freddie Highmore is an awesome young actor. He has a charm, earnestness, and warmth that are unmatched by many mature actors. When he is with Depp, the movie is amazing. Burton could have done more of this, instead of indulging in the bizarre and absurd. Then again, that is not in his nature. He is a skillful and eclectic director. ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" is worth seeing."
"muraderdem","4","0","3","13 August 2005"," Big disappointment
","I went to see this movie as soon is at came out in Turkey. I was more excited about this movie then any other because I had grown up watching the original and wanted to see what the great director Tim Burton and awesome actor Johnny Depp would add to this classic. To tell you the truth this duo in my opinion took all the things that made the movie amazing and turned it into a movie where its bizarre but lacking the amazement factor the original had.<br/><br/>First of all Johnny Depp turned out to be the most horrible Willy Wanka I could think of. The lovable, friendly and funny Willy Wanka had been substituted with a man which is just messed up and scared. I read that Burton had been inspired by Marilyn Manson while figuring out how his Wanka should be and it turned out to be a fiasco. The Umpa Lumpa were just weird all looking the same and ugly, with no cuteness or anything. The musics were very disappointing as well and I believe is a low point in one of the greatest soundtrack composers in the movie business, Danny Elfman.<br/><br/>The list could go on and on, the great scenes that were taken out turned the trip in the factory in a trap of eliminating children, and taking Slugworth out of the movie with his offer to all the kids killed the movies main message. Charlie ended up winning the prize because he did NOTHING. THAT'S NOT THE POINT. Charlie should have brought the EverlastingGobbStopper back to Wanka rather then turning it in to Slugworth for the money which was a virtue causing him to win the factory. The flashbacks even though gave some insight to Wanka's life, took us away from the factory and the magic of the place, if there was any left.<br/><br/>All and all except for the visual effects today's technology offers Tim Burton was not able to add anything to this movie and took out so much that made this movie the high point of my childhood. If you are a fan of the original movie be prepared to disappointed as I have been."

I even thought it seemed to follow the dialogue verbatim, but it has been a while since I last read it. The oompa-loompas were great and even the songs didn't put me off, as I'm not a fan of them in films.<br/><br/>The acting talent was superb - Mr Depp made yet another memorable character - and the effects and props were first class.

","When I saw the trailer for this film I knew it was one I wanted to watch but was wary that maybe it would not live up to the hype as many movies often don't, I was very surprised as it surpassed what I had expected. This film is another great hit from the wonderful Tim Burton, if you have enjoyed any of his previous films such as Edward scissor hands and beetle juice then I am sure you will enjoy this as much as I did. Johnny Depp is at his very best as the wonderfully weird Willy Wonka, nobody plays this type of role as well as he does. The film is colourful, witty and fun to watch. With it's big lavish and colourful sets and a brilliant performance by Depp it is in my opinion the must see movie of this year (well so far). Both me and my 7 year old daughter thoroughly enjoyed the film, in fact seconds after it had finished my daughter wanted to go straight back in and watch it again. All I could hear was her laughing, especially when Wonka proceeded to walk full force in to the door of the glass elevator. Definitely well worth the ten pound paid for the tickets, I highly recommend watching this film to anyone.<br/><br/>This film of course is closer to the book written by roahl dahl, who by his own admission did not like the first version entitled 'willy wonkas chocolate factory'. This film is far more superior to it's predecessor.<br/><br/>I can't wait for Tim Burtons next release later in the year called the corpse bride, an animated feature along the lines of the nightmare before Christmas. If it's anywhere near as amazing as Charlie and the chocolate factory then I will be happy."

","Charlie and the chocolate factory is a great film but i think it is pointless. Re-makes of films are never as good as the original although this 1 comes close. The characters are similar and Johnny Depp plays a great Willy Wonka. Charlie and the chocolate factory is finished off better, it has a more complex ending and feels completed unlike Willy Wonka and the chocolate factory. Although there are no songs in this Charlie and the chocolate factory apart from the oopmah loompah songs about the children most of the words are the same as the original so its just a copy of Willy Wonka and the chocolate factory. In the book and Charlie and the chocolate factory, they use squirrels as the animals which get rid of Veruca salt however in Willy Wonka and the chocolate factory they use swans that lay golden eggs, Because the director and script writer wanted to be slightly original. Therefore I think Willy Wonka and the chocolate factory is better than Charlie and the chocolate factory."

","Willy Wonka, a disturbed, man-child genius, creates magic with (chocolate) candy. At the story's beginning, sublime sweets are his compensation for a sad childhood that was ruined by a scientific father who puts ideas over and above affection (see ""Peeping Tom"" for a parallel).<br/><br/>At the start of the famous tour of Wonka's human-devoid factory, which introduces five ""lucky"" children to the surpassing creativity of imagination-in-isolation, we meet a disturbingly strange individual. Willy doesn't know how to be with people because, strictly speaking, he is not himself a human -- at least not in the social sense. Such has been the extremity of his isolation that his links to other persons are strictly biological.<br/><br/>Without knowing it, the Burton-Depp Willy throws open the doors to the factory in order for Willy to start becoming human. His public desire to find an heir is just a cover for his deeper desire to enter the fellowship of social humanity before it's too late.<br/><br/>The cautionary tale dimensions of the story, wherein the movie fails most blatantly, depend upon the garish, one-dimensional vices of four of the children tourists and their culpable parents. Both Willy and the movie fail to identify the cold perfectionism of Willy's upbringing as the source of the heartless critique of gluttony, arrogance, egotism and aggression that send the four to their comeuppance. Since Willy is nearly a monster himself -- albeit a subtle, clever one -- it's only fitting that his tour group be peopled by monsters. Therefore, the humanity of the film and Willy's humanization, until the very end, lack the warmth of understanding and tolerance for human frailty that would put charm and goodness into creative counterbalance with the cautionary elements.<br/><br/>Charlie Bucket, a Dickensian good fellow and the fifth tourist, who is free of any discernible flaws, via staunch family values, delivers Willy's comeuppance, which disgraces his exquisite narcissism while humbling him into a reconciliation with father and, beyond that, introduces him into human fellowship.<br/><br/>This fairy tale, by merely upbraiding bratty children while sanctifying the everyman golden boy, plays out as a cold, intellectual exercise. What's needed is dramatic examination of fallible flesh and blood handled with knowing affection (see ""Shrek"")."
"aimless-46","8","0","2","7 August 2005"," Some Comparisions to the Original
","This is a remake that cries out to be compared to the original. In part because there was no reason other than making money for even doing the remake; the original's story and the style are pretty much timeless. And in part because Tim Burton did not use the opportunity to do a different take on the original story; he pretty much stayed with the same tone and style. But the story itself is so interesting that even multiple remakes are welcome.<br/><br/>The question then is whether this remake is worth watching for those who liked the original? The answer is an qualified ""yes"". If you have not seen the original and if you like fun fantasy films it is almost a sure thing. If you liked the original you should enjoy the remake but will probably feel that most of the charm of the original is missing. <br/><br/>Here are a few comparisons:<br/><br/>All the original songs have been replaced by more ""techno"" stuff that is showcased by Oompa Loompas doing Busby Berkeley numbers. These are rather ordinary, but since Veruca's and Violet's original songs were the only ones really memorable the change is pretty much neutral. The exception to this is Burton's satire of Disney's ""It's A Small World Afterall"" which greets the visitors in the courtyard of the chocolate factory. The hokey puppets which eventually short circuit and self-destruct is inspired and is clearly the best addition to the story.<br/><br/>The remake works in spite of Johnny Depp who gives a game but generally uncomfortable portrayal. This is made worse by the timing of the release because it is hard to get past the Michael Jackson caricature; whether intentional or unintentional.<br/><br/>Gene Wilder's Wonda was an omniscient and paternal character, whose weirdness was all affectation. Depp's Wonka is a deeply disturbed psychological mess, with lots of real issues. This allows for a number of flashback scenes into his rather nasty childhood. These are generally painful to watch and with each revelation you are thinking: ""I didn't need to know that"" and ""I wish I hadn't seen that"". Whatever Depp and Burton may think they gain from this, they break the unity of the film and taint the story. In a lame attempt to pull this new stuff together, Burton tacks on a moronic ending which just makes you regret not leaving the theater after Mike becomes a microwave signal.<br/><br/>Because the story does not crash and burn until the final few minutes, it works well as a remake and most should enjoy it on its own merits. For others it is worth watching just to try to figure out where the $150 Million budget went. Considering that the original's budget was $3 Million and its slightly off-kilter Victorian production design is significantly better than the look of the remake (""Wizard of Oz"" meets ""Resident Evil"") you have to truly applaud everyone associated with the original's set design."

","When I look at all the positive reviews I can't believe my eyes. I really liked the first part of the movie when the 5 winners are found and presented. But what happens in the chocolate factory itself is visually stunning but very low on a human level. You never have the feeling that the kids are in a real competition and the parents react so strangely unemotional when their children screw up and must leave the party in such a painful way. Too bad! The 2001 joke was very funny, though. Of course there are some great candy ideas presented in the factory. But when you've seen one, two or three, then you've seen them all. The Gene Wilder version was much warmer overall. So I prefer that one when you compare the two."

I would say, Gene Wilder's version has two virtues, the two songs and Gene Wilder.<br/><br/>This version has Tim Burton's quirky, unmistakable stamp on it. Fantastic sets, beautiful imagery, and a central character that has trouble relating to the world.<br/><br/>Gene Wilder's Wonka was warmer, but Johnny Depp's characterization had reasons he's more standoffish. I understand the direction he took the character (also it's consistent with Tim Burton's worldview). I like both takes of the same character but unfortunately if forced to pick, I'd pick Wilder. Only IF I'm forced to pick. I'd rather have both and fortunately, I do now.<br/><br/>Freddie Highmore, he's a competent actor, like Dakota Fanning is a competent actress. Yet I didn't warm up to him. I do love the original Charlie, who had expressive eyes. He wasn't that competent but he didn't have to be, in that role.<br/><br/>I think it's interesting this version is entitled ""CHARLIE and the Chocolate Factory"" when we have more about Willie Wonka here, while in ""WILLIE WONKA and the Chocolate Factory"" the focus seems clearly on Charlie."

","I thought the film was excellent. Jonny Depp's performance as Willy Wonka was fabulous, creepy yet lovable. I can see why so many people were drawing parallels between Depp's Wonka and Michael Jackson.<br/><br/>Charlie Bucket, played by Freddie Highmore, was almost too virtuous to live, but within the reality built by the film he worked.<br/><br/>The bad children were all excellent also, each one detestable in their own special way, each one a nice anti-Charlie, making Charlie seem even nicer in comparison.<br/><br/>Although I liked the Oompa Loompa's, I didn't think they were as good as the original film's. They would have been better if they were orange, with green wigs. But you can't have everything, I guess.<br/><br/>There were dozens of points in the film where I had to stop myself from laughing too hard (so I didn't miss the next bit), which in my opinion is a fabulous sign! The special effects were a little obvious, but they don't spoil the enjoyment of the film, and the sets are fantastical in the extreme which works very well for the film.<br/><br/>The only criticism I could really level at it was that I didn't think the addition of Wonka's dad into the story did anything beneficial at all. You could feel where the film slid from ""book content"" to ""new stuff."" It felt very much like two separate stories which they'd tried very hard to hammer together."
"Chris Knipp","Null","0","1","4 August 2005"," Slick unease: Tim Burton's beautiful but nasty Roald Dahl remake
","""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" may be disquieting but isn't as creepy as you'd think from the parallels people have drawn between Johnny Depp's Willy Wonka and Michael Jackson. Parallels there are, mind you. Willy is of feminine appearance, with wig-like straightened hair, sickly smile, and too-perfect, unnaturally pale face. He lives in a preserve that's Neverland-like, the chocolate factory he's done over to resemble a candy jungle. Big difference: he doesn't like little boys -- doesn't like children at all.<br/><br/>If Tim Burton's Willy Wonka isn't quite Michael Jackson, who is he? For one thing, like Edward Scissorhands (in his first appearance he's got giant scissors in his hand) Willy's a remarkable misfit who can't relate to ordinary people. If you're feeling ordinary, this typically beautiful but strange motion picture from Tim Burton may arouse mixed feelings. Its initial sense of order and logic turns to unease when Depp's Wonka appears. After a while the whole elaborate spectacle wears out its welcome as its little initial core of warmth goes cold. Not so different from many a classic children's story, I guess, it's full of terror and random cruelty. And like so many of those, it sprints to a happily-ever-after finale that leaves our unease unresolved.<br/><br/>Ostensibly the story celebrates a happy family and offers hope to victims of bad ones. Willy's a sad adult who can't pronounce the word ""parent"" but is saved at the end by regular dinners at Charlie's house -- becoming a partial member of the loving little household. Despite such poverty they've had to live on cabbage soup, Charlie chooses unhesitatingly to remain with mum, dad, and all four grandparents, who sleep together, the grandparents do, in one bed in the center of the little gingerbread house.<br/><br/>Willy -- in flashbacks not in Dahl's story -- is seen with dentist father, made to wear a hideous cage on his head slightly exaggerating the orthodontic braces once actually used. Dentist dad forbids all sweets, and Willy becomes obsessed with them.<br/><br/>Wonka's become a huge success in business by leaving home early, and it's an understatement to say he's a genius inventor. He works miracles. Adapting the children's tale, Burton deals only in superlatives. Everything is the best, the most, the most typical. The chocolate factory is the biggest in the world by a multiple of hundreds.<br/><br/>The factory's been closed for twenty years but still mysteriously produces vast quantities of universally coveted sweets. What happened to all the townspeople left unemployed by the official closure? The movie doesn't tell, except that Charlie's grandfather is bravely poor, in his cozy bed. Five golden tickets are randomly planted to allow five children to visit the secret factory -- this, it turns out, is to find an heir -- or, as the joke is, a hair, because discovering one gray one during his biannual haircut made Willy realize he needs somebody to take over the factory when he grows old.<br/><br/>The movie's based on the old-fashioned moralistic concept of good vs. bad character. Except for Charlie, each of the other children with golden tickets is dominated by an evil trait: gluttony, snobbery, ambition, or pride. Charlie alone is loving, modest -- and nice. Freddie Highmore of Neverland, who works with Johnny Depp again playing Charlie, has a sweet spontaneity that makes Charlie's goodness likable and real.<br/><br/>The factory setup and the ranging of children types is marked by stereotyping and even racism, beginning with the fat orly-poly German family with their gluttonous son whose father runs a sausage shop, and continuing with the snobbish English people, the technology-mad Americans and the obsessive, competitive American females with the mother who pushes her daughter to win prizes in meaningless things. She's going for a Guinness record for longest time chewing the same piece of bubblegum. Strangest and most perverse of all, Willy Wonka has brought little creatures from a country where they adore coca to be his slave workforce -- the Oompa Loompas -- who're all clones of the same tiny Indian man (Deep Roy) -- a model of at-home outsourcing, perhaps. The conceit is as astonishing as it is weird. Burton has his nasty cake and eats it too, because the less likable children are done away with at first, and then brought back and allowed to leave the factory, if somewhat the worse for wear.<br/><br/>There's a song and dance routine done by the Oompa Loompas at each of the bad children's moments of downfall and it's pointed out early on that this means Willy had everything planned. But he pretends his worker-entertainers are just good at improvisation. The very idea of such a thing in such an elaborately staged movie is a huge joke. Tim Burton is the most calculating of cinematic artists, and a master of high kitsch.<br/><br/>Particularly disturbing is the way the spoiled child of James Fox's snobbish English nut factory owner (Julia Winter) is attacked by dozens of squirrels and she and Fox are thrown down a tube to be smothered in weeks-old rotting garbage. The chewing-gum girl's fate, being blown up into a huge ball and turned blue, and the technology boy's, being shrunk and then stretched wafer thin, or the German kid's, being jammed into a chocolate-filled tube, aren't really any nicer; in fact their damage is more permanent. Depp's pronounced American accent is a curious inconsistency. He did manage a good Scottish one for ""Neverland.""<br/><br/>It's a happily incestuous crew. Depp has worked with Burton famously before, and Depp has worked with Freddie Highmore, and Helena Bonham Carter's a Burton regular who's back with Depp as his dead bride in Burton's coming delight, ""Corpse Bride,"" which will also feature Oompa Loompa Deep Roy.<br/><br/>There's no doubt Tim Burton has a gift for the menace and unreality of children's literature, but ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,"" for all its miraculous perfection, is an indigestible confection."
"alexandra-25","Null","0","2","4 August 2005"," This is more Butonesque than Dahl: Could contain spoilers.
","This film manipulates the original story of Dahl in order to be used as a vehicle to revive Tim Burton's reputation as a director. In this respect this is less of a film adaptation of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, but more of a Burtoneque film.<br/><br/>Here Burton depicts Grandpa Joe as more of an eccentric - doing his Irish jig when rejoicing in Charlie finding the Golden Ticket - than a slushy sweet Grandpa, as in the 1971 adaptation. As Charlie's mother,Bonham-Carter is poor at expressing herself as a careworn impoverished parent: she is here clearly a privileged middle class actor trying to play an impoverished careworn mother. This leaves her attempts at a careworn image relying heavily on the set design and the clothes Bonham- Carter wears.<br/><br/>The film set also relies on the depressing stark and drab image of the Bucket household, factory exterior, and cold winter scenes to bring out the vivid colours of the Wonka factory.<br/><br/>It is here in the Wonka factory that we find the grateful, if not merciful Oompa-loompas as the loyal work-force of the factory. The idea that these poor Ooompa-loompas should be merciful that they're employed at Wonka's factory is perhaps a typical view of a right - wing factory boss, and owner! What have the Ooompa-loompas to be merciful for? After all they are there because Wonka, a colonialist has stolen all the Oompa-loompas' natural resources, causing them to be reduced to eating mushy caterpillars, and living in trees. Then Wonka has the audacity to go to their country and think he is saving them through benevolence, in that he subsequently employs these poor people in the Wonka factory, where they are mercilessly exploited by Willy. <br/><br/>In this film we also note the changing nature of work, where education and specialist skills are important to the success of the profiteering factory owner, as in this case of Charlie's Dad having to become skilled in the maintenance of factory machinery to gain employment.<br/><br/>This is the stark reality that is Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.<br/><br/>Just a word on Johnny Depp, who appears at times bored with playing the character of Wonka. It appears that he has had electrolysis in order to gain more than a mere clean shaved look for the role of Wonka, but I suspect it's merely the clever makeup that gives this illusion. Depp is an extremely intelligent, and very adept actor all the same. Oh, and a very beautiful man too!<br/><br/>Note the reference made in this film to Edward Scisorhands, when Wonka is holding a pair of scissors following his ribbon cutting ceremonial opening of the Wonka factory! It is not the holding of the scissors, but the way Wonka waves them about with his hand that makes the reference to Scissorhands.<br/><br/>This is an OK film to see."
"Matt_Layden","7","0","1","3 August 2005"," Weirdest Film of 2005
","First of all, let me say that this film is nothing like the original, there were so many things that were not in this film that were in the original, which made the film seem very short. Through out the whole film you know what is going to happen and when you don't see it you kind of feel let down, but then the film goes on after the ending of the original and you get new material on the screen.<br/><br/>This film has BURTONS style written all over it, the opening score, the Buckette's house, evening the references to his other films are in here. (Peewee, Edward). It's always a treat to see a Burton film because his sense of style is always ""twisted"" and unique.<br/><br/>The music other then Elfman's score was sung by the Oompa Loompas and they were short and only happened after a child was disposed of. Of course it was funny to see that little guy sing and do the little dances, but I still say that the original Oompa Loompas were great and should never have changed. I never read the book, but in the movie it shows the back story to the Oompa Loompas, living in some kind of jungle, it was neat to see that.<br/><br/>In saying that, this film, unlike the original which centered on Charlie, deals more with Wonka. Going to the jungle or Loompa Island and finding the Oompa Loompas, hell even going as far back as to show Willy as a child and his father the great Mr. Lee, or as someone said in the audience. ""Holy Sh*t, it's Dooku"". As stated before this film is full of references to other movies and one is 2001: AOS, in the TV room (the big white room) it has 2001 on the screen and I know that I was the only one in that theater that knew what it was.<br/><br/>So Depp as Wonka eh, well this is the part that scares me, he was freaky. Not like the original Wonka at all. He sounds like a child, looks pale and acts like a child. Depp was quoted as saying that the inspiration was a game show host locked up for 20 years and then finally let out and I believe it. He was great, had the right funny/scary/weird sense and look to him. Of course Wonka and Depps performance is the most weird part of this film, that doesn't take apart from the fact that the film itself is weird, it goes up there with any Lynch or Cronenberg film as being F'd up. Not in an I don't understand way, in a this is F'd up way.<br/><br/>Which film do I prefer, hard to say cause the original is a classic and I never read the book, but as good as the film is there were some parts that I could of done without. Mainly one being Burton showing the other children leaving the factory. Agustus is covered in Chocolate, Violette is still blue, and I won't tell you about the other two, but what I liked about the original is that you never knew what happened to them, if those Oompa Loompas really did take care of those kids or if there were something darker going on in that factory. All in all, the kids did the job of acting like kids and the parents did the job of acting like parents, so nothing special there.<br/><br/>Depp's performance, the sets, comparing to the original and Burton behind the camera are the reasons to see this film, but if you loved a lot of things about the original....like Slugsworth, the floating/burping, Wonkas office, then you'll end up being disappointed because they are not present in Burtons film."

","It's been years since I've seen the original movie and yet still I remember enjoying it and of course the 'oompa loom-pa' song. The same cannot be said of this remake. I was intrigued upon hearing that this would be a darker Willy Wonka but Depp's performance here seems unusually off the mark. All the Michael Jackson-isms aside (intentional or not), the character seems never to be really understanding his own malevolence and so comes across as more innocently dangerous than dark and plotting! The songs in the movie are terrible and forgettable with the exception of the puppets' performance of ""Willy Wonka"" prior to everyone's entry into the factory on their tour. The cast do well enough with what's given but rather like ""Attack of The Clones"", it does seem that everyone got sick of looking at blue screen sets. Some nice kaleidoscopic set-pieces do little to offset the general feeling of boredom that comes on after the first 20-25 minutes or so of the movie, which are actually okay. In the end, I was happy to get my bum off the seat and walking again. If I am ever to watch a version of this movie again, I shall be opting for the older, brighter and altogether more enjoyable version!"
"ledow","7","0","2","3 August 2005"," 5% goodness, 80% darkness, 15% new.
","As an old fan of the ""original"" adaptation I was looking forward to this more modern ""Dahl-friendly"" version (apparently Roald Dahl never really approved of the Gene Wilder version).<br/><br/>Firstly, the special effects were obviously better, the original always had the hint of bits of wood and swathes of cloth to build the sets. Unfortunately, some of the effects were very noticeable as being false, the motion of CG characters too stiff or routine, the split between real and CG parts of the set too defined.<br/><br/>The storyline is more complete and true to the books and, as such, Willy Wonka is much darker than in the previous version. However, I would be very concerned about a young child watching this version as opposed to the child-friendly Wilder Wonka. The melting dolls, the attacking squirrels, the scary Wonka and the horrible dentistry would be enough to scare many younger kids.<br/><br/>Although the script may be closer to the book, at times you long for the witty comments and expression of the Wilder Wonka of old. The funny lines are not as funny, delivered so strangely, the Wonka is not nearly as identifiable. You get the feeling that you would want to wash yourself off after being with Depp Wonka for any length of time.<br/><br/>That may be the reaction Dahl was going for but, having now seen both, the Mel Stuart version had changes for obvious reasons. Wonka was much more acceptable and identifiable, the little ditties were more enjoyable and relatable, the inserted quotes fitted, the strangeness of Wonka did not make him so scary, the special effects budget didn't exist so some parts they had to make do (I am assuming that is why squirrels and geese were interchanged) and the flashbacks only detract from the story.<br/><br/>Put Wilder into the newer CG world, take either set of child actors (although the old Veruca would always be better, the rest are on level ground), use the witty comments, quotes and songs from the old along with the best of the new, use some of the extended parts of the plot from the 2005 version and transplant them into the 1970 version and only then it would be the definitive Wonka.<br/><br/>Oh, and Helena Bonham Carter was completely mis-cast and isn't even close to believable as being a struggling housewife."

","I think that this movie is very good because it is an excellent remake of the old film and johnny depp (willy wonka) plays an excellent roll as him. hes very funny and takes all of the children's comments sarcastically. i also think that the children are more realistic than in the original. Freddie Highmore does a good job as Charlie bucket but in the film they have changed the end which isn't as good. This film wasn't hyped up like some other films which turn out to be rubbish.

","When I went to the cinema, I was really looking forward to this movie - having acted in a school production as Charlie meant it held good memories for me. I was really disappointed. It is nothing like the book - yes, I know, not all movies based on books are the same, and are often very good anyway, but I feel the film would have been better if it had stuck more closely to the original source material. For me, there were several problems with it: <br/><br/>1) Casting - all the children are cast well, especially Freddie Highmore who gives a good performance as Charlie. I also quite enjoyed Philip Weigratz's performance as Augustus Gloop - I was suitably revolted. However, I feel that Johnny Depp's performance as Willy Wonka was disappointing. Depp is a superb actor, but it didn't come through in this feature. I didn't enjoy him (Wonka) like I do in the book. In the movie, he came across as a social misfit with serious issues in need of psychiatric help. Everyone apart from the kids gave completely mediocre performances. <br/><br/>2) The scenes with the Oompa-Loompa songs and dances were far too choreographed and, well, fake. The music was too modern for people who don't seem to 'get out', and watching each scene just reminded me of Bollywood dance scenes, e.g. the kind that can be found in 'Bride and Prejudice' (which I know is not Bollywood, but contains many of its elements). <br/><br/>3) Part of the concept - from other comments, I assume the movie allegedly took place in England, yet everything is so 'americanised' - accents, the giving of the dollar, etc. These ruined it for me.<br/><br/>However, it had to have a saving grace, and that is the factory itself - wonderful - this pushed up the rating I would have originally given because it's exactly like a child's fantasy. Overall, bearable."
"TheWindshield","7","0","1","1 August 2005"," Sweet flick, but Depp is a little tangy
","Firstly I would like to point out that I have not read Roald Dahl's novel from which this movie is based off, but I have still been a huge fan of Willy Wonka and Charlie Bucket since first watching Gene Wilder's ""Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory""...and then in every repeated viewing since. I was eagerly anticipating this movie for quite some time, especially since ""Big Fish"" has made Tim Burton one of my favorite directors. And, despite my high expectations, I liked it! The basic plot line of ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" is pretty well-known. Charlie Bucket is a exceedingly likable kid who loves his family and dreams of touring the mysterious candy factory headed by Willy Wonka. And when Wonka creates a contest to let five children into his factory by hiding five golden tickets underneath five Wonka Bars, his dream is finally realized. The story in itself gives the feel that the aura of the movie should be one of magic and mysticism, and Burton does a pretty good job at giving us that. While I generally favored the 1971 film's version of generating the mystery behind Willy Wonka, his contest, and his factory, the quirkiness of this trip cannot be denied.<br/><br/>The highlight of the film is Freddie Highmore's portrayal of Charlie Bucket. Every time he gave a line, you just fell for his naturally good-natured attitude towards life, despite the challenges his family faces. I only wish he was given a bit more air-time, because the movie is worth seeing just to see Highmore act. The other four children (Veruca Salt, Augustus Gloop, Violet Beauregarde, and Mike Teavee) are all very lovable in their own respects, and are easily as good in the roles as those in the other Willy Wonka film. Sometimes they have a bit too much edge in their step, but it's all part of the nuttiness of the movie. Their parents don't have the impact they had in the original movie (all of them were hilarious in that), but their positions here are not completely compromised. The Oompa Loompas were right on point, and their classic songs have been pretty well updated for some good laughs from the audience. More back story to the Bucket family is very much appreciated as well.<br/><br/>The only major qualm I have with this film is Johnny Depp as Willy Wonka. I absolutely adored Gene Wilder as this character, with his quick wit, memorable one-liners, and general attitude towards his factory, the children, and the magic surrounding them all. While Depp does an incredibly good job as the character he develops (a nervous, neurotic Wonka), it just seems off somehow. While his character was written to be one a bit mental from his isolation, he appears to be engulfed in trying to be too weird. It is rather easy (while unfounded) to see where the Michael Jackson comparisons come in. He can be pretty funny at times, however, and it is also wonderful to see how Willy Wonka came to be with some ""increasingly"" common flashbacks with the splendid (but rather scary for this movie) Christopher Lee as Willy's father.<br/><br/>But this is a pretty good film. While not as candy-coated as the 1971 classic, it's perfect for today's audiences. It is definitely worth seeing by old and young...but make sure to see ""Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory"" first. <br/><br/>My Grade: B+"
"CyberJackhammer","8","0","1","31 July 2005"," A Great Film With A False Title
","A great production, Charlie and The Chocolate Factory provides entertainment throughout its running time.<br/><br/>The vibrancy, production assets, script and for some humour all combine to make a cast-iron blockbuster lacking any major faults. Burton's art direction benefits the film greatly as he creates a sense of disbelief in the audience as they examine the other-worldly design of the scenery that looks like it emanates from delirium. His artistic approach is seen none more clearly in the contrast between the ebony dusky dwelling of the Bucket household and the Wonka factory which looks like as if was previously used to make paint until it exploded. Depp's portrayal of Wonka is impressive as it demonstrates his ability to completely adapt to any kind of production whether it be drama or comedy and it also suggests the lengths he's willing to go to transform himself and make his role more tangible to his audience. Burton and Depp are the film's two biggest assets.<br/><br/>As aforementioned the film is devoid of any major faults but there are a few annoyances that need to be addressed. Most prominent is Burton's decision to focus upon Wonka and the vile parent and child couples rather then Charlie and the rest of the Bucket's. A common problem among Burton's movies (think Batman) in that he spends more time focusing on the oddities rather then characters with a hint of normality such as The Joker or in this instance, Wonka. However, the script demonstrates Charlie as a plain child (to the extent his averageness is even commented within the introductory 10 minutes.) As such, this film would be more suited with the title of it's 30 year old counterpart. The second gripe is the casting of Freddy Highmore who seems to be too sickly sweet to be the eponymous lead. Putting his family first, the role of Charlie does call for the desire to be morally upstanding but Highmore seems too honest and too much of a champion to be considered an 'average' child.<br/><br/>A film that offers much to a variety of different audiences, Charlie is easily the second most quality summer movie of 2005 behind Batman Begins."

","I recently watched Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and this film alone is not bad. Tim Burton's creative cinematography is a delight to watch and is very captivating. However, overall this film does not compare at all to the original. Yes of course the effects are going to be better because this film was done on a $200 million dollar budget oppose to the first film which was done on a very low budget. But looking beyond the effects the original film's humor was much more funny. It was very dark and satirical and I found the humor in this film to be much more childish and for younger audiences. I also think that Gene Wilder played a much better Willy Wonka than Johnny Depp. Now, I am a huge Johnny Depp fan, and a Tim Burton fan. But I don't think this role was for him. Gene Wilder's Willa Wonka was so much more funny and natural. Overall, this is not a bad movie and most kids and people that are unfamiliar with the first film will probably fall in love with it. But for real movie fans I think they will notice the flaws and realize that the original was much better."

","{Written directly after returning from the cinema.)<br/><br/>As an appreciator of Depp's past characterisations, especially in 'Fear and Loathing' and 'Pirates of the Caribbean', I was eager to see what he would come up with for Willy Wonka. And Depps performance is very much central to the film: a 'showcase' as they call it.<br/><br/>Opinions have be circulating that he had borrowed a lot from Michael Jackson, and the expectation of witnessing some sort of insipid beautification of Jackson's character did cast a shadow of foreboding over my trip. But given that I'm not sure as to whether or not this is true after watching the movie, this matter will probably remain in the realm of speculation (unless Depp himself has a comment there). <br/><br/>In fact Wonka's pallor, his timid voice, and his vulnerability reminded me mostly of Edward Scissorhands. <br/><br/>One thing is sure, his performance owes nothing to Gene Wilder's nose-powder interpretation of Dahl's Willy Wonka.<br/><br/>Depp's Wonka is more vulnerable and has psychological depth. The film is not so much about a fulfilling of the dreams of a disadvantaged boy: it's is more about the salvation of the psychologically scarred Mr Wonka. (Indeed, in one scene he is 'on the couch').<br/><br/>Tim Burton has mellowed out a lot since his 'isn't-life-awful' early movies, something which is evident in this film: the 'PG' certificate was probably settled by the toss of a coin. There is nothing in this Burton offering that instills dread in the soul.<br/><br/>It's good, it's very good. But like I said: it didn't quite grab me. It sorta lacks heart. The whole production just sorts of slides past you like a Wonka Bar on a conveyor belt. And you enjoy it like a candy bar. Then forget about it. Although completely engrossing, the film was a bit lazily put together in some ways: in some parts the cast seem to be standing in the wrong place and some effect is missed because of this. One minor annoyance is that I couldn't understand half of what the Umpa Lumpas were singing. (Some large, multicoloured subtitles, or something similar to the 'displaying of key-words' strategy in the original film would surely have helped there).<br/><br/>If the film was about to be erased from my memory, (by means of some novelty Wonka candy created to do this), before I eat this magical candy I would write a note to myself to go see the film again.<br/><br/>And the message in that note would also I think be valid to all those out there who would like to escape reality for a cuppla with a trip to this absorping, charming and captivating candyland: <br/><br/>""Go see Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"""
"mrforgetful","7","0","1","30 July 2005"," A curious rendition of an old song
","I really didn't know what to expect when I paid for my ticket to see this movie. I KNEW that it would be nothing like the old movie, and much more like the book. Alas, I was correct. But therein lies the problem. While the classic Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory dwells less on the book and more from the excellent adapted screenplay, the new one stays almost entirely on the book source. What's the problem with this? It's a children's book. There's not a whole lot to it. Just like in the book, most of the lines go to Willy Wonka or Charlie, and sometimes Grandpa. Only occasionally do the other characters say something interesting. The kids are interesting enough, especially Augustus Gloop, who I liked enormously better in this one than the old (haha get it, enormous...). But anyway, the parents just pretty much follow their kids and don't offer much enthusiasm for anything. In the old version, the parents were just as interesting and diverse as the snotty kids they brought to the factory, adding humor and substance to the story. Not so in here.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp was very interesting as Willy Wonka. Not quite as inviting as Gene Wilder (who did an excellent job in the original), but very unique. Like the rest of the movie, he's more like the description the book offers than in the original. I think I would have liked him better if he had better things to say.<br/><br/>That goes for pretty much the entire movie. The set design and everything were as they should be, but the script is what fell behind and dragged these marvelous actors with it. The movie would have hummed with magic and whimsy and been much funnier if the screenwriters had stepped aside from the book at times and allowed some creativity to enter their brain flow.<br/><br/>The oompa loompas are much better in the old one. nuff said about that.<br/><br/>So basically, the old one is better. It may not be fair to judge the two movies, since Tim Burton didn't try to imitate the old one, but overall Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory is just a better movie. I'm still a Burton fan, and this movie is by all means infinitely better than his last ""reimagining"" (planet of the apes). Watch this movie if you've wanted to, just don't buy a bag of high hopes at the concessions."

","Went to see Charlie and the Chocolate factory last night. And while it was good I had some problems with it. 1) They implied quite seriously that they were in England.. They constantly referred to sweets and chocolate as Candy. The money being referred to was at all times dollars. When Charlie found the money in the street it was not English money, This annoyed me. 2) The whole Wonka back story was terrible and should have been left alone.. or if they were going to do it they could at least have made it more realistic.. As in england there was no following of Halloween until the eighties.. and the chocolate and sweets in the flashback were clearly too modern (petty I know but still annoying). 3) I love Johnny Depp and thought he was good, but he was no gene wilder, his Willy wonka was difficult to like. Gene Wilder created a much more likable wonka. 4) the tunnel scene was crap.. I loved the original tunnel scene, it was dark and scary and perfect.. this wasn't. 5) the kids were cast perfectly as were their parents.. the oompa loompas were good if a little difficult to understand at times. and the last song was superb.. <br/><br/>It was a good film but the original was far better.."
"madscientist2787","4","0","1","29 July 2005"," Not Burton's best, but still very tasty. SPOILERS HEREIN.
","There are spoilers in this review.<br/><br/>Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, it seems, is virtually impossible to judge without comparing it to the 1971 Willy Wonka film, regardless of the insisting of Tim Burton's loyal fanbase that it is not a remake, it's an adaptation of the Roald Dahl story. According to Burton's promises prior to the film's release, it was to be a darker film, truer to Dahl's book than the Gene Wilder movie, which he described as ""not one of his favorites."" The plot, for those two or three of you who have not read the book or seen Willy Wonka deals with a mysterious chocolate tycoon who places five golden tickets in bars of his chocolate, the finders of which are invited to take a tour of his wonderful factory. One of the finders is Charlie Bucket, a poor boy who only has chocolate once a year for his birthday, and the other finders are a collection of spoiled li'l turds from all around the world. However, as it happens, (and I'm gonna give away the ending here because it's as ingrained into our cultural vocabulary as the fact that Darth Vader is Luke's poppa) Wonka is actually looking for an heir to his factory, which he finds in Charlie, after all the other kids are eliminated from the tour as a result of failed conscience test-related accidents.<br/><br/>To be honest, Mr. Burton's assessment of his film as truer to Dahl's source material than the '71 film is, in my opinion, not entirely accurate. Yes, there are trained squirrels sorting out walnuts in this version rather than geese laying golden eggs. True, the Oompa Loompas in this film are pygmy natives (all wonderfully played by the same quirky, Indian little-person actor Deep Roy) rather than the freaky orange-painted munchkins of the original film. But other than that, this is Burton's movie. From the freakish set design to the characterization of Wonka as nervous, gleeful but emotionally stunted from years of isolation, Burton has stroked, twisted, sweetened and pummeled Dahl's story and made it his own. After films like the deeply flawed Sleepy Hollow and the putrid Planet of the Apes, this will no doubt sound bad to a great many viewers, but in truth, Burton actually quite well with this material.<br/><br/>The visuals are clearly what Burton has the most fun with. Wonka's factory is a cross between Disneyland and Halloweentown with elements of Mario Bava and Dr. Seuss. The Oompa Loompa songs look like the freakiest of Bollywood musicals, and Danny Elfman's interpretations of Roald Dahl's lyrics (all sung by the composer, overdubbed hundreds of times) sound more like his old Oingo Boingo songs than anything he's composed since. The Mike Teevee song segment goes as far as to lampoon everything from 2001: A Space Odyssey to heavy metal videos, cooking shows, Rock-'Em-Sock-'Em Robots, and Psycho. Charlie's hometown is enveloped in softly-falling snow, another Burton trademark, and the kind of gadgetry seen inside the chocolate factory would make Pee-Wee Herman and Vincent Price green with envy. Almost all of the actors are perfectly casted. Young Freddie Highmore (reportedly recommended to Burton by Depp because of his performance in Finding Neverland) is wonderful as Charlie; he's possibly the finest child actor working today. David Kelly (also terrific in Waking Ned Divine) is wonderfully charming as Grandpa Joe. Noah Taylor and Elizabeth Bonham Carter are very empathetic, despite their somewhat brief screen time, as Charlie's parents. Almost everyone in the cast outshines their 1971 counterparts, except for Veruca Salt, Violet Beauregard and their parents, who are hilarious in the original film and aren't given very much to do in this film. Johnny Depp and Gene Wilder play very different but equally brilliant Wonkas.<br/><br/>The film also features a series of flashbacks to Willy Wonka's childhood, which was never discussed in the book. These scenes feel somewhat out of place with the rest of the story, but they are still a joy to watch, particularly because Christopher Lee, who may well be the single coolest living human being, plays Willy's dentist father. ""Lollipops,"" he snarls, he voice dripping with contempt as he shifts through his young son's Halloween candy. ""These are what we call 'cavities on a stick'."" He proceeds to throw the confectionery treats onto the fire. After sneaking candies whenever he can and taking notes of his observations, young Willy runs away from home to become a chocolateir. This, as we find out, is the reason for his reclusive, eccentric and child-like behavior.<br/><br/>As to which version of the story is 'better,' the '71 film (which Roald Dahl reportedly hated) has moments in it that are superior to most of what happens in Burton's film; chiefly the hysteria of the world looking for the golden tickets (""I am now telling the computer exactly what it can do with a lifetime's supply of chocolate!""), the exchanges between Veruca Salt and her hapless father, and Wonka's insane, snake and chopped-off chicken head-filled riverboat ride. However, the mix of unexplained darkness, do-goodery, and illogic make for a much more confused film than Tim Burton's interpretation; a version of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory that operates on its own rules, but clearly understands them. If it does anything for the original book, it proves that no film taken from a literary source is in fact the 'definitive' interpretation; it is merely how one artist sees things. For that, I think that Mr. Dahl would likely be pleased."
"LivinForMovies","7","0","2","31 July 2005"," Good movie, not as impacting as the original
","I hate to compare 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory' with it's predecessor, but 'Willy Wonka' was such a wonderful movie that it's hard not too.<br/><br/>I enjoyed 'Charlie'. There were some wonderfully funny and wonderfully warm parts. The introduction of Wonka at the factory was potentially my favorite part(the song is still stuck in my head). Freddie Highmore is excellent as Charlie, and the showing of the family relationship he has is really touching. The scenes in the beginning with his family are some of the best(David Kelly is wonderful). Then comes the aforementioned scene of the unveiling of Wonka. Up to this point the movie is very enjoyable. Now arrives the factory tour, which is my only disappointment with the film. It seems very rushed to me, with each scene racing to get to the next child elimination. In 'Willy' they take time to appreciate all the wonders that are the factory. 'Pure Imagination' is deeply missed in this version. They just wizzed by to get to one less child and an Oompa Loompa song(which have nothing on the originals). For how visual Burton is, I'm really surprised at the little amount of time that is dealt to the wonders of the factory. I also felt there was too much focus on what was wrong with the kids, it was just evident in the original and not put under a giant magnifying glass. Also, Charlie and his Grandpa are hardly featured once the factory tour starts, when they really are the most wonderful part. <br/><br/>On Depp's performance, a wonderful performance by a top-of-the-class actor. In watching him, I couldn't even tell I'd seen him in anything else before. I don't think it was entirely the right interpretation of Wonka(but I also was in love with Gene Wilder's performance), but it was an amazing performance nonetheless.<br/><br/>I have to say, the scene with the squirrels is potentially the scariest thing I've ever seen. It jumps ahead of 'Christmas Vacation' for scariest squirrel scene.<br/><br/>The ending of the movie was very disappointing for me. I thought a lot of it was unnecessary and tried too hard to be touching.<br/><br/>All in all, it's a fine movie. It doesn't have the resonance of 'Willy', and I could have lived without it being made, but it is not a waste of a movie."
"y2jdarro","7","0","2","30 July 2005"," 1971 v 2005? 1971 Wins!
","After watching the 1971 version of the book last Sunday and the 2005 version today, I have come to the conclusion that I preferred the original version. Now I know the author Roald Dahl hated it and this one is more associated with the book. I did enjoy the film and laughed a couple of times especially with the Wonka tune at the front of the factory had me and my brother in stitches, I still enjoyed the original better.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp's performance of Wonka was good at times but disturbing at others. I haven't read the book in a very long time but I am damn sure that the whole father back story was not apart of it and although it was a nice little touch, I feel it ruined the ending a bit when he couldn't Charlie to bring his family but eventually does when he ties his knots with his father. Furthermore, the film to me seemed a bit rushed especially the golden tickets ordeal. The original panned it out a little but it seemed to me the whole thing was done in 5 minutes. The kid's characters were convincing but just did not like the fact they weren't given more time on screen or more things to say because it seemed that Wonka was hogging all the limelight for himself.<br/><br/>Some people have criticised the songs the Oompa Loompas sing after what happens with each child but I thought they were quite catchy and was nice that they were the songs from the book and is a thing the 1971 version could have had even though I love the songs in that film.<br/><br/>Again referring to Wonka, some people say he was like Michael Jackson and some people did not recognise that at all, in my eyes he sounded like MJ and had the creepy little laugh as well but was not entirely creepy. Again I am another supporter for the Gene Wilder Wonka and liked some of the little quips he came out with and wasn't entirely rude to the children or parents like Depp's portrayal. Freddie Highmore had a good role and liked him but again he played second fiddle to Wonka and even though he is probably the main character of the book and film, the whole thing couldn't focus on him.<br/><br/>I am not a huge Tim Burton fan but like some of the films he has done like Edward Scissorhands and Nightmare Before Christmas, he has done a good job of a great book and again it is more in lines with the book. The sets are well done although some of it is CGI, it is wacky and zany. Overall, I will give this movie a 7 out of 10 as I did enjoy the show, had some laughs and it was more in connection with the book. However I love the original better with the great songs and the people there act their parts better as they are given time on screen to do so (the kids in this version did not do a bad job though but could have got more time). I will get the DVD once it comes out as I have the original version also."
"matley85","7","0","1","29 July 2005"," Stark raving Wonka Bonkers!
","First and foremost, I have not read Roald Dahl's book Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. Most of you will think ""then how can I review it?"". Well listen up; this means I can keep an open mind on certain elements as of course I won't be judging the entire film purely on its faithfulness. But going by the accurate title this time round, I figure Tim Burton is going down the old 'faithfulness' road.<br/><br/>Little in the previous Gene Wilder film did we ever assume Wonka is crazy. In Burton's new adaptation we are given a number of hints such as Wonka repeating himself when he is not aware. His obvious social detraction from society and the misencounter of love. After spending a number of decades in a chocolate factory along with 'little people' you'd expect to be slightly bonkers.<br/><br/>Towards the end of the movie I began to feel the heart of this film is about the Wonka's exploration of 'what is love?' Given that you know from either the book or the Gene Wilder version that nearing the end Wonka offers the factory to Charlie on the condition that he lives there by himself. Wonka has trouble understanding his negative choice because he hasn't felt love or a connection to people before. <br/><br/>Here is where Burton's film has something over the 1971 movie; now we are given a number of flashbacks from Wonka's childhood and his story of why he lives the way he does now. We understand him more than we did in the 1971 adaptation.<br/><br/>Now lets get down to it. Is Johnny Depp a better Willy Wonka than Gene Wilder? Take a seat. I'd guess those die hard Dahl fans will say 'yes', going by those I heard on the way from the cinema to the car anyway. Personally, Gene Wilder is much more of a comfort to watch because his fun and joy for the world is shown much more humanely. His hobbled entrance to the film was such a great example of his playfulness. We can relate to Wilder's Wonka much more...but maybe we're not supposed to. We have to take on board Wonka has been self-isolated the majority of his life, lives in a chocolate factory alone with a number of Umpa Lumpas and as a result of this, how can he be like the rest of society and how can we ever think for a second he's like us???<br/><br/>There is one problem I had with this film and that was the new Umpa Lumpa songs. My god they got on my tits. It just didn't fit in the tone of the film at all. They were far too Modern Pop; the song in the squirrel scene was almost...Backstreet Boyish. Danny Elfman is the master, and achieves this title by his atmospheric soundtrack. He's a complimentary to fairy tales. He hit it on the nail with the actual Willy Wonka song which is featured during Wonka's entrance and the first trailer for the film. So why the hell couldn't he carried on hitting that nail all the way down with the Umpa Lumpa songs?<br/><br/>I really should read the book though."
"bopdog","7","0","1","29 July 2005"," Adequately charming and entertaining. True to the dark and creepy book by the dark and creepy Roald Dahl
","I liked the original, even though the 'special effects' of that one were lame, even by the funky FX standards of the early 1970s. This second one was better in some respects, not as charming in others. The first had heart, however contrived it may have been. But do remember that with the era of the first one, none other than the ancient, albeit venerable, Sammy Davis Jr., famous lounge singer from the 1890s, seemed the appropriate choice to snatch the 1st movie's theme song (Candyman) and make it his own signature tune. Anyway--- that just shows how old and fusty the first one was.<br/><br/>The second one, this movie, is a lot truer to the original Roald Dahl book. But hey, as much as the unwashed masses are keen to admire the 'emperor's new clothes', that is, to praise Dahl as a genius of kid books, Dahl is, to be honest, a very dark creepy writer. In my humble opinion, I question whether his books are even suitable for children. After having read his actual books, and not just having seen movies based on his books, I myself would not allow any child over whom I had responsibility or influence to read them. They are mean-spirited, ugly, and really, kind of disgusting.<br/><br/>Having said that, the marvelous and always amazing Johnny Depp did a good job. The kids were great, and Helena Bonhan Carter was a brave trooper to sport real 'Englishy-looking' teeth as the poor mother. It was also nice to see Missy Pyle, the hottie alien from the great 'Galaxy Quest', begin to emerge from what had begun to look like permanent third-banana character actor status.<br/><br/>Given the dreary and disturbingly creepy book source, this movie was adequately entertaining. TAKE your kids, though-- and be prepared to talk with them and comfort them as needed. Do not just send them in to the theater alone."
"cal_culus3","5","0","1","29 July 2005"," I just didn't get it
","OK, Johnny Depp freaked me out in this movie. I mean, what is up with his mouth. Everything in this movie was so....eerie, surreal. Can't you expect Tim Burton to create just a normal movie. No, he has to make it all dark and ....the movie was so DULL.<br/><br/>I was not in the least bit excited when I watched the movie. The original, if I remember it, was at least bright. I mean, overall the movie is not half bad. But the fun stuff in it was just not good enough. And the KID. Don't get me started on the goody goody types. I hate kids like that. And what is so horribly wrong with the rest of the kids. So, the guy is fat, and that makes him detestable, so the kid is competitive, so WHAT??!! The other kid is totally into computer games and is a smarty pants. OK, nobody likes a spoiled brat.<br/><br/>Nooo, only the bleeding heart Freddie Highmore, as always wins. Willy WOnka is the only character in the whole movie that was likable. Because, Depp can make any character he play, doesn't matter how bad it is, very likable.<br/><br/>Conclusion: watch the movie, if you got nothing else to do, like me."
"pinkpapillon","10","0","2","28 July 2005"," Johnny Depp's Chocolate Factory
","What a fun and unique movie! Johnny Depp sheds his sex symbol status for an hour and a half to bring you a hilarious rendition of Willy Wonka. Although quirky and a little goofy, this movie was laugh-out-loud funny from start to finish! Depp, unlike his predecessor, was funny and lovable. Charlie Bucket is excellently portrayed by Freddie Highmore who is as cute and funny as he is talented. I know this movie was not supposed to be a re-make of Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, but it needs to be said that the 2005 movie is infinitely less creepy! It differed in so many ways that the ""old"" movie was unrecognizable in this new rendition."
"bryonpav","9","0","2","27 July 2005"," It worked, sort of.
","Lately, with Burton's ""Big Fish"" and now ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"", it's become obvious that he thinks he can handle emotions well enough to make powerful films... he cant. He's a good director, he manages to keep his audiences entertained despite the fact that countless critics continue to bash him to death, but he's trying to add dimensions to his movies that he hasn't and probably never will master. He's a brilliant artist, he has a skill for making his movies visually and auditorily stunning... but near the end of ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" Burton tried a little hard to pull a ""time to cry"" ending like we saw Spielberg do with E.T.<br/><br/>Problem was, Burton couldn't do it so no one cried good thing was, it wasn't necessary for people to cry bad thing was, it came off as a little obvious<br/><br/>Maybe I'm being too critical, the movie was good... the cinematography was wicked good. The oompa loompas were very entertaining. The plot worked for the most part. And the acting really caught a lot of people off guard, which was good, I think.<br/><br/>I've never liked Depp, he doesn't know how to be subtle enough to act and he always seems overly phony and exaggerative, however as Willy, it worked."
"tekntonk","10","0","3","28 July 2005"," New and Improved!!!
","I really enjoyed this film - I went with my partner the first time, and the second time we took our two children, ages 7 and 10. Although I loved the first 'Wonka' movie which made a huge impression on me in my childhood years, I have to say this version is better.<br/><br/>I admit, I'm very partial to Burton movies - I love his wit, style, dark humor, etc. so I was thrilled with this version. For those of you who didn't find this version scary enough, take it from our kids - they both said when discussing the film afterwards that they weren't sure if the children in the movie were going to come out all right or not, and that they felt Wonka Jr. was very sinister (see his knowing facial expressions and bizarre detachment from the seriousness of the 'demise' of each of the naughty children as well as the way he grooves to each of the songs nonchalantly, almost gleefully).<br/><br/>And OK, maybe the giant worm and bug scenes were missing from the boat-ride, but frankly that always rang a bit false to me when I was a child watching the earlier film version. I was glad they were dropped. I also really enjoyed the ending. Another reviewer said that the ending felt 'tacked on' -- I can't understand this as the entire film built up that storyline all along during each of Wonka Jr.'s uncomfortable flashbacks. But to each his own, I suppose.<br/><br/>I do want to go on record as heartily saying I think this version is STILL a kid's movie -- although they might not get all of the tongue-in-cheek wit, they can still appreciate the golden rules taught in the story, and the beauty of the film itself. The music was highly amusing and very entertaining - another Elfman masterpiece! I also thought it was superbly acted by all - dead-on characterizations of each person in the story, leaving me feeling the tale was better than I had remembered it."

","A Tim Burton movie. Hm... a line like that may automatically make movie-goers stray from ever seeing the movie. It did for me. The trailer and the fact that he was doing a new take on one of my childhood's classics made me very skeptical. However, I went to see it anyway for the wonderful Johnny Depp. I expected him to basically be the only enjoyable part of the movie.<br/><br/>I was completely wrong. Burton did an AMAZING job. The movie is not a remake of the splendid musical as many may expect. It had another take on some elements which added more to the movie. You see young Willy and how his childhood affected him.<br/><br/>The element of family importance is the main theme, I feel. Charlie is not flawed like the old version had which makes the movie slightly saccharine. But if you consider how a child can be severely grounded because of his or her poverty, it seems more real. Johnny did a superb job and I hope he gets an Oscar for his performance. :-)<br/><br/>Overall, it touched me as ""Edward Scissorhands"" and ""Big Fish"" did. So if you've got a sweet tooth, see ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" for a sweet treat!"
"collinboy11","9","0","2","27 July 2005"," Excellent Adaptation!
","Tim Burton has wonderfully captured the spirit of Dahl's book. I especially love the visuals. Tim Burton has always been a master of a unique look and feel to all of his movies. I am a huge Tim Burton fan, and a huge Johnny Depp fan. Depp is amazing, as usual. His Willy Wonka is far different than that of Gene Wilder, witch is good. I'm still a fan of the original, although I do have to say the original did stray from the book in many ways. The pacing of the film is quick, as it should be. Although, there is a small portion of the film where it lags a bit, but other than that, the pacing is wonderful. The performances are wonderful, especially that of Freddie Highmore, and David Kelly as Charlie and Grandpa Joe. One other small little complaint was once they enter the factory, the center of attention tends to lead toward Willy Wonka instead of Charlie. The Oompa Loompas are great. I really enjoyed the fact that they were all voiced by Danny Elfman. Johnny Depp really does do a wonderful job as Willy Wonka. I'm kind of bugged that some people are comparing his performance to Micheal Jackson. First of all, Depp himself said he didn't portray Willy Wonka as Jackson, and was surprised when heard people were comparing the two. Second of all, Jackson loves kids, Willy Wonka hates them. And third, the book was written when Jackson was just a kid. And honestly, when I watched the movie, Micheal Jackson never even crossed my mine. <br/><br/>This is a wonderful adaptation from the book, and is a film that the whole family can enjoy. Although, Depp can be a bit creepy sometimes (which is great!!!) Now, I can't compare the two movies. Because honestly, they are completely different from each other. I am a fan of both movies, but if I had to choose one movie over the other. I'd probably go with Tim Burton's film. Great film. Nine stars out of Ten........Although, it is hard to top the tunnel scene in the Gene Wilder film."

","WARNING: May Contain Spoilers Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, which I will go on record as saying that it is the Best Movie of the Year so Far. Of course, it's still a smidge under the original, but I must say that Johnny Depp is perfect as Willy Wonka, playing it like a 10-year-old trapped in a 40-year-old's body. You get a nice back story of WHY and HOW he started the chocolate shop way back when. And Christopher Lee, from Star Wars (Darth Tyranus) and LOTR (The evil dude) plays a good role as Dr. Wilbur Wonka, a candy-hating dentist and Willy's father, a character made specifically for the film. This Movie is surprisingly MORE true to the book than the 1971 version, which was written by the books author, Roald Dahl. Why is this? Well, the director of that one hired a ""Ghost Writer"" to change the script. This movie is timely to today while remaining true to Dahl's vision of the Factory. This is Tim Burton's Masterpiece, his definitive work. Batman, Edward Scissorhands, Big Fish, all excellent movies. But this one Tops them all. The kids are phenomenal, giving off snappy one-liners like they've been professional comedians for years, and this includes Depp, who is just like a kid in this one. But the true highlight of this movie is... the Oompa-Loompas. Actor Deep Roy, who has collaborated with Burton before and will again in the upcoming Corpse Bride, also starring Depp and Helena Bonham-Carter (Charlie's mother), was digitized 100,000 different ways, allowing EVERY Oompa-Loompa to be played by one actor. This movie also lets you see how Wonka discovered the Oompa-Loompas. The Odd thing is that Depp's Wonka never seems to age, as you see in flashbacks. In fact, no one else seems to age either... Christopher Lee's character should, by all means, be DEAD by the time of this movie's setting. Anyway, any problems with this movie are minor. I have no choice but to give it a perfect score of 10/10."

","When I first saw Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory some unknown years ago, I was convinced that no other movie would ever take me into the world of fantasy and magic the way that movie did. Of course, as I grew older and saw more movies, I would be convinced several times more, by movies such as The Princess Bride, The Lord of the Rings, and Big Fish just to name a few. Nevertheless, Willy Wonka always held a special place in my movie memories. That being said, I went into the theaters last week to see Charlie and the Chocolate Factory with great anticipation, if not trepidation.<br/><br/>I found myself pleasantly surprised as the ending credits rolled. Though I never read the book or any literature concerning this story, I understand that it was suppose to be more true to the book. Regardless, this movie explored many aspects of the characters, including Willy Wonka himself, in ways that the first movie never did. That said, many questions that I (as well as many others) had concerning the first movie was answered in Tim Burton's version. There are also several interesting twists toward the end of the movie, all leading up to a rather satisfying conclusion.<br/><br/>My few criticisms about this movie concern more about the acting than the story. First, despite a strong performance by Freddie Highmore (Charlie), he was never as convincing as Peter Ostrum (the original Charlie). Ostrum was able to portray himself as a genuinely good kid, but at the same time depict realistic childhood behaviors, such as when he stole some of the fizzy pop. I felt that Highmore's Charlie was a bit too forced at points in the movie. Gene Wilder's performance was also better in my opinion, maybe because he showed a bit more humanity and love for his work, his oompa loompas, and Charlie himself. I know this may be different than what the original author intended, and Depp may have played the role the way it was suppose to be played, but nonetheless, he came off alien and disconnected at various times in the movie.<br/><br/>Despite all that, this is a must see for everyone who was a fan of the original, and a must see for those with an imagination as big as their appetites for chocolate."

","That sums up my opinion of this great movie. <br/><br/>I viewed this movie last night at the IMAX theater in Nashville TN, and was blown away. Burton and Depp have come together to remake a modern classic that is even better than the original. So many remakes go horribly wrong and pale in comparison to the original they are based on that you leave with a bad taste in you mouth. A few examples ""Rollerball"", ""King Kong"", ""Pyscho"", and that attempt at remaking one of the worlds greatest comedy's ""It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World"" that was remade into that travesty ""Rat Race"", even Mr. Burton himself had a horrible remake misfire with ""Planet of the Apes"". Other movies, such as ""Twelve angry men"" and ""Godzilla"" do nothing to improve on the original. <br/><br/>This is NOT the case in this movie. This is one of the few examples where the remake is not only better, but Much better than the original. Mr. Burton has produced a movie that at first appears to move very slow, but suddenly before you realize it you are caught up in a whirlwind of sights and sound that passes far too quickly. Suddenly you realize all the bad children have disappeared right before your eyes and you have felt not one ounce of remorse for any one of them. (The only remorse I felt at this point was that the movie was nearing its end) But not quite Mr. Burton gives us an extended ending that is MUCH more satisfying than the original. Often times good movies end so quickly that you feel the same as you do after spilling your pumpkin pie on the floor after thanksgiving dinner. You had a great meal and are full but something is missing at the end. This is the way I felt after viewing the original, but this is not the case here, viewers are treated to a great movie with a VERY satisfying ending. <br/><br/>A further note on the actors, every one in this movie gave a great performance that was fitting of their character, however top Kudos go to Johnny Depp and David Kelly for their performances as Willy Wonka and Grandpa Joe.<br/><br/>And VERY special praise and Kudos to Mr. Deep Roy for his incredible performance as the Oompa Loompa. I have never been more impressed with one actor playing more than one character than I was with this.<br/><br/>One last piece of advice; If there is an IMAX theater anywhere near you showing this movie, make the drive, the sights and sounds in this movie when blown up to super size makes an incredible impact on 3 of your 5 senses, Sight, Sound, Touch. (You can feel the rumble of the boat and the machines in the factory.) it is well worth the extra effort and admission."

","I'm surprised by how dark some people are making this movie sound. Sure it's a bit quirky, but that's what makes it so enjoyable! The previous film, Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, had much less spunk and fun to it. Kids will enjoy the bright colors and fantastic displays, while adults can laugh at some of the absurdities and odd (but quite funny) quotes by Wonka himself. Johnny Depp does an excellent job playing the part of Willy Wonka and Freddie Highmore was cast equally well as Charlie Bucket. Another character who was well casted was Helena Bonham Carter as Mrs. Bucket. She plays the part of a loving and concerned mother very well. The movie itself is great fun and ,ith the exception of a little slowness toward the end, keeps the viewer interested and into it the entire time. I think this movie was made to be enjoyed by people of all ages and I think it accomplished that purpose."

","*** Not really a spoiler in my opinion, but anyway...<br/><br/>I saw the original Gene Wilder Wonka in a theater when it was first released, and at the time, it was a magical film even for a 13-year-old. I read the novel in my 30s shortly after seeing Edward Scissorhands, and imagining Burton and Depp remaking the film came easily at the time, especially after watching the original again on video during that period.<br/><br/>The plot of ""... The Chocolate Factory"" makes for a good story, but not a great one. All three versions have flaws, yet none share the same flaws. The characterizations of the kids in the book are flat, even Charlie. Except for ""The Candy Man"" and the ""Oompah Loompah Song"", the songs in the Wilder movie are intrusive, and the burping scene is unnecessary. Only after reading the book did I understand why; it was added. This leads to the fatal flaw in the Burton/Depp movie, adding the father back story. Willy Wonka's quirks should not be explained.<br/><br/>Enough comparison, the new version stands well on its own and I rate it a 7. Whether intentional or not, Depp injects way too much Michael Jackson into his Wonka and it is distracting. I often felt that Depp was walking through his lines like a one-trick pony and that he relied too heavily on his charisma to carry him through many scenes, much like Jack Nicholson did in The Witches of Eastwick.<br/><br/>To sum up, all three are good entertainment and well worth a look or two, but like all confections, they quickly melt away leaving a pleasant but empty memory."

The children were so convincing in their roles as to make you glad that what happened to them was needed but also let you know that it was reversible so that really nothing bad happened. I would see this again and still enjoy it with my children and I know that my kids would love to see it many times.

"troyalisme","4","0","1","26 July 2005"," Bad!
","I went to see the movie without reading any reviews for the movie but being a huge fan of the original. After the movie i was dismayed at the positive feedback of critics. today, i was in awe when i saw that this movie had an average rating of 7.7/10 on IMDb. This movie lacks so much and yet is too much at the same time. There's not heart in this classic children's story, it's just a cold, callous film that has lost sight of it's goal. Since it's not a kid's movie and too childish, silly, and asinine for adults (or so i thought) I really can't believe all of the positive reviews. I feel as if i'm the only person who recognizes how disappointing this film really is. When i watched this movie, I was bored and found the experience as bad as it would be to watch TROY, War of the Worlds, and BEWITCHED in a row. The movie has too much of Tim Burton's touch and fails to become anything memorable or commendable. Even JD's performance was too much and out of place in such a story. Well, i recommend people avoiding this movie because it is a bad movie that many people find enjoyable and ""cute"" but I found to be very a perfect movie for 2005 (i.e. a bad, over-blown film)<br/><br/>What's the spoiler you may ask? CATCF is an DISGUSTINGLY AWFUL movie!!!"
"myleenjan","5","0","1","25 July 2005"," Music was weird, script not as witty as the first....
","Am I the only one who thought the music really dragged the movie down? Especially the opening theme song. The Oompa Loompas were pretty creepy and the music was totally unfitting of the movie mood... which made it both cheesy and dark at the same time. They were either singing really bad ""hip hop"" or really seedy 70s glamrock or strangely, a combination of both. One scene in particular where they walk into the place where everything is made of candy, had some really horrible, bizarre sounding instrumentals in the background that didn't make you feel like you were strolling through a fantasy candyland, but rather a really bad haunted house for 5 year olds. Most of the songs you will easily forget after the movie is over, since you won't find any cool or catchy tunes. I am also a firm believer that the music makes the movie seem all the better (loved music from all the HP movies, for example, which had to work!).<br/><br/>I think the jokes, character development, music and script in the first movie was much better done, especially for the other kids in the movie. Everyone except for Charlie, Grandpa Joe and maybe Wonka, had little depth. The other kids were boring and not very realistic. Wonka could have been a little funnier, and he seemed like a combination of Edward Scissorhands and Michael Jackson. Pretty freaky.<br/><br/>The special effects were good, but not used to the full advantage. especially because the music was such a turn off.<br/><br/>I'm a fan of Roald Dahl and the first movie, so I think I had high expectations. I was also not happy about the change in the ending or the cut of one of the side stories. I wouldn't say this was a bad movie but a disappointing one."

","First I must start out by saying ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"" is my all time favorite movie. There I said it, now lets talk about this Luke warm attempt at a re-make.<br/><br/>Loved Johnny Depp, the trailers don't do him justice, but he does give Willy a creepy Michael Jackson quality.<br/><br/>The movie starts off really wonderfully, I was excited to hear the kids reactions when there was no golden ticket and when there was. It gives me a warm fuzzy to hear those innocent reactions to story they haven't heard yet. So that said....<br/><br/>The factory. Tim Burton can not tell a story or convey the magic of the original. He even said in an interview he never liked the original and also wanted to remake the story. He needs to go back and read the book and find the story. His transitions are boring and uneventful. His characters are lost and unlikeable. Unlikeable, but we really don't care what happens whether their good or bad.<br/><br/>A friend summed up this movie in a nutshell. ""Image visiting a house you grew up in, it's been remodeled and new people live there, and you just feel awkward being there.""<br/><br/>I can't recommend seeing this flick, because it just encourages Hollywood to keep remaking and ruining classic movies. Just look at this summer ""War of the World"", ""Willy Wonka"", ""Bad News Bears"", ""Herbie"", ""Amittyville"", ""Wax Works"" etc. There's slump in the box office, according to Hollywood, and it's because of this rehash trash."

Highmore performed magnificently in this film, as I knew he would due to his performance in ""Finding Neverland."" I thought that there was no way that Depp could beat Gene Wilder as Willy Wonka, but boy did he come close. The one disappointment I had was the oompa loompas. Deep Roy is creepy, and the oompa loompas look nothing like the original! The music they sung was awful compared to the first movie. The surreal make up and sets were like a dream.

"Zombafyed","5","0","2","24 July 2005"," For a different generation
","I knew the reviews on this flick were going to be split 50/50 love/hate. So I'll try to stick one in the middle.<br/><br/>For lovers of the original, do not go into this movie expecting the Wilder version. You WILL be disappointed. The similarities will make you expect the same warm feelings, but for some reason, you might leave the theater cold, and maybe angry.<br/><br/>It was a colorful film, and there was some good acting, but the menacing, mysterious Wonka is definitely missing. Maybe it wasn't Depp's fault, but with the combination of makeup, script, and character development, we end up with what everyone else is calling a androgynous Jacko-Wonka. Depp doesn't have that semi-psychotic explosiveness that Wilder's Wonka had. Depp's character is more true to the book, but let's face it, Wilder's Wonka makes the audience fear and love him at the same time. With Depp, you have a non threatening wise cracking, high pitched Wonka. Adults will make the connection to Michael Jackson, but it is doubtful that the kiddies will. Highmore does an excellent job with Charlie, and isn't as annoying as the original Charlie. His family also has more interaction. As far as the kids: Augustus was improved, much funnier; Veruca,..well, honestly the original Veruca definitely seemed more like a spoiled little brat, so you were happier to see her go; Mike TV is annoying in both films, however, I kinda liked the original's Jay Leno-ish lisp. The implementation of video games for the new Mike will probably connect better with kids though; Violet was definitely improved, and her mom was just creepy, but thats good.<br/><br/>The beloved familiar songs are gone, and while the lyrics of the new soundtrack might be clever and humorous, the accompanying music is too loud and cluttered to hear it. While I was watching, I noticed that most songs ended without a chuckle from the audience, and I attribute that to them being inaudible. The effects were well done, a nice surprise in this era of crap CGI laziness in Hollywood. The Oompas are all the same character, which honestly doesn't really bug me that much. The music is what let me down. I like the background on the Oompas, it added a little fresh air to the movie, and gave you something new, and not redone.<br/><br/>You definitely get a little more knowledge of Wonka's background as well as Charlie's family, including a dad that was not present in the first flick. I thought the background story was good, however, it was not presented in a timely fashion. It's hard for this film to compete with the original, just on nostalgic value alone. The original is a bona fide classic, and even though technology has changed, it is not the most important factor. Especially in a movie that is supposed to tug at your heart strings, as well as dazzle your eyes.<br/><br/>Children will love it, and maybe cherish it when they are older, as the older generations now cherish the '71 version. But us older folks might leave the theater disappointed, noticing Hollywood's greedy hands as they stick their hands in our pockets while trying to distract us with 'amazing' CGI. Don't get me wrong, like I said before, the CGI was good, and the sets were great, but there was something missing, something needed to draw you in and captivate your imagination. I went into this with a solid confidence that if anyone could or should redo the original, the Burton/Elfman/Depp crew were the ones to do it. I've been a huge fan of the trio since I can remember, and have had, and will continue to have faith in their creativity and vision. Corpse Bride looks awesome, and I'm sure Burton will redeem himself with that one.<br/><br/>This is a delicate anomaly of a movie to review, so I'll end with this: Don't see it if you want to see a new, improved original. See it if you are taking your kids and family. The joy that they will get from it might stir up the joy you got from the original, just in case the new one doesn't tickle your fancy."
"carollann57","10","0","2","22 July 2005"," A treat for all who see it!
","Wow!!!! What a phenomenally amazing movie!!! I have long been a fan of the book, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, and the first ""Willy Wonka"" movie. That being said, I must say that I enjoyed ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" twice as much as the 1971 version. To begin with, the current version is more visually appealing. The sets were bright and colorful, and more in line with what you might expect from a reclusive genius' workplace. I loved the back story explaining Willy's great love for chocolate and why he was so determined to make it big in the chocolate business. But all of that would be meaningless if the acting was less than great. Fortunately, all of the performances were tremendous!!!! No kidding!!!! Every single one, from Charlie's bed-ridden grandparents to the chocolate master himself. Most notably, Freddie Highmore was cute as a button from his mud spattered high-water pants to his adorable dimpled cheeks. He brought a purity and innocence to his role that was very genuine. All of the other kids were deliciously annoying, as were their parents, which made you realize why the kids were so disgustingly bratty. The oompa-loompas were a scream, and I thought replicating one person to portray lots of oompa-loompas was a very clever and creative touch. The musical numbers were hilarious, without the in your face moralism of the 1971 variety. But I save my greatest praise for Willy Wonka himself, the truly great Johnny Depp. I know he seemed a little creepy, but wouldn't anyone be after being alone in a chocolate factory for 15 years with nothing but oompa-loompas for company?!!? Johnny Depp provided just the right amount of weirdness and sensitivity to the role and has proved himself again to be one of the greatest actors of our time. Mr. Depp never disappoints!!! This movie was a treat for so many reasons. I was very happy to see that Tim Burton toned down the tunnel ride. Fans of the '71 version will know what I mean. ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" was pure pleasure from beginning to end! I will see it again in the theater and be the first in line to purchase the DVD!!! Excellent movie, all the way around!!!"
"nopurpose229","9","0","2","24 July 2005"," An Amazing Movie; More than a Recreation
","If you are going to see this movie and looking for a recreation of ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"" then stop now. Time Burton phenomenally directs this movie with amazing sets and design. The world of the chocolate factory is breath-taking. The amazing contrast between the drab city and the vibrant factory is one of the many stunning visual effects.<br/><br/>The children in this movie are back with just as terrible, if not more so, personalities. Charlie is also extremely well played and fully portrays the Charlie from before.<br/><br/>The main difference in Tim Burton's version is Depp's idea of Wonka. Wilder makes Wonka out to be a cynical and tormented man. Depp describes Wonka as a child who only grew in physical size. He constantly swings from a serious tone to bitterly sarcastic to completely delusional. His character mirrors that of a child forced to live as an adult. Many people have compared this portrayal of Wonka to Michael Jackson. This comparison has some merit as both seem to be trapped in their childhood, but this does not demerit the performance at all. Just because such a likeness exist does not mean the Willy Wonka should not have been played as such.<br/><br/>Tim Burton also fleshes out the movie by adding the background of Wonka and a short segment about the history behind the Oompa Loompas. Wonka's twisted beginnings truly demonstrate why he has turned into such a clash between childhood and adulthood.<br/><br/>Another addition of Tim Burton are the new songs for the Oompa Loompas. Instead of the stagnant tunes from ""Willy Wonka and the Chocalate Factory"", multiple short songs from various genres are played. All completely choreographed to fit with the genre, these scenes are a great laugh for those who have seen the original.<br/><br/>*SPOILIER START* <br/><br/>Tim Burton even injects a very funny exchange of dialogue criticizing who the dance and song by the Oompa Loompas seems setup and planned.<br/><br/>*SPOILER END*<br/><br/>This movie is an excellent view and I completely recommend seeing it. It provides a much fuller movie experience and covers the background and explains the future of Charlie; this is a large bonus as the original lacked any background or future. If I could I would give the movie 9.5 out of 10 because there were only a few points where the movie could have been slightly tweaked. The scene where Charly brings home the ticket just seemed to have some awkward dialogue. But by these ratings I will give it a 9, because 10 is reserved for perfection.<br/><br/>To reiterate, this movie is a great new experience even for those who have seen the original. But if you are just looking for a new version with revamped visuals, don't waste your money. Compared to the original, ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" is an amazing experience, surpassing the original as an entire movie."

","A really great re-make of the earlier Gene Wilder movie version. Very entertaining although it has a slightly different ending that is a bit more family orientated. Johnny Depp plays the lead role easily which is ideal for his off-beat character. The kids characters are played out really well too. For those that are interested I found that the Charlie and the chocolate factory story lives on at the Roald Dahl Museum in Buckinghamshire in the UK which pays tribute to all of the authors works not just this story. There is also a modern interpretation of the wonka bar at chocolotto.com which seems quite interesting and would be interested to hear what others think."

","Edward Scissorhand and Sleepy Hollow are just two of the now 5, including the upcoming ""Bride's Corpse,"" movies that they have made together. And this one is as good as the others. Johnny Depp does an excellent job at playing the odd Willy Wonka, the king of all candy makers. What really makes this version interesting is not only is it not just another re-make, it includes an explanation of why Willy Wonka loves chocolate so much, but seems to shrink at saying the words, ""parents."" It includes Christopher Lee as Wonka's father, who is a dentist that greatly disapproves of anything concerning candy, which seems to be the underlying inspiration of Wonka's life. Included in the film is Freddie Highmore as Charlie, whom we've seem playing Peter in Johnny Depp's last masterpiece, ""Finding Neverland."" He plays the poor boy gone lucky well, and his connection with Depp is almost obvious. What makes this movie different also is the fact that all the other kids actually have something wrong with them. In the other version with Gene Wilder, there is almost a little bit of sympathy to the kids who don't really seem to have much of anything wrong with them, especially Violet, who's only fault is chewing gum. In this one, Violet is a constant competitor, along with her mother."

","I've seen the movie together with a friend of mine and together we make a short comment about the movie. The acting was (especcially Depp) quite poor. There was very little chemistry between Depp and the children. He didn't clearly say that the children had to touching the dangerous things which caused falling out children. Gene Wilder was MUCH better. I think Micheal Jackson was EVEN more natural than Depp in the story. Willy was even paler than Uncle Fester.<br/><br/>What we DID like about the movie was the flashbacks to the childhood of Wonka. That gives a reason why he started the factory. The history of the factory was also mentioned and that was really meaningful.<br/><br/>The family of Charlie has get a bigger role in this movie. What gives the picture more depth.<br/><br/>The most disappointing thing was the absence of the sin (floating liquid) of Charly and his granddad and also the element of the fake spy which Wonka used to test the children of their honesty.<br/><br/>Our final conclusion is that the movie has some meaningful extra's in comparison to the Wilder-flick and also some big disappointments also in story-elements and acting. Overall an entertaining film with some great special effects (but the last was not always very original)."
"johnscook","6","0","1","23 July 2005"," Special effects masterpiece, but lacks charm and pacing
","This updated version certainly provides exceptional special effects that were not possible when the original movie was made; I never thought that something wasn't possible. Although, I wondered how Augustus Gloop could be sucked into a machine with such force that his eardrums or eyeballs wouldn't explode, but that would be an awful scene for a 6-year-old to witness.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp usually provides a great interpretation of the characters he plays, and he certainly put forth a lot of effort to create Willy Wonka. However, Willy Wonka comes across not as eccentric, but just plain weird. In the original, Gene Wilder provided an element of eccentricity that would be appropriate for a business man who spends most of his day dreaming up new ways to entertain the senses rather than counting money. He had excitement and despair. Johnny Depp doesn't count money, but he seems to have created a character that plays like a weird assistant to Willy Wonka rather than Wonka himself. Other than the disappointments of his own childhood, he didn't seem to have a heart. There was no element of goodness sneaking a peak now and then. This is distracting to the movie because I never got a sense that I understood Wonka, nor did I want to. This persona is someone to avoid.<br/><br/>I've read that this new version interprets the darkness of the book (that I never read) more than the original movie did. There is nothing wrong with being dark, but there needs to be charm. Even dark villains can have charm, but there was no charm here. For example, Veruca's father bought thousands of candy bars to find the golden ticket before we ever saw Veruca demand that he get her a ticket. This reduces the effect of Veruca's spoiled behavior and makes her just seem whiny. This is one example of the moving putting the cart before the horse and screwing up the pacing.<br/><br/>Another disappointment is that the original movie gave us an immediate way to watch and measure the integrity of the children and their parents by finding out who was ready to give away an Everlasting Gobstopper. There is a similar test of integrity in the new movie, but the test is only on Charlie and only at the very end of the movie. Charlie does want to sell his ticket at the beginning of the movie in order to serve the greater good of his family, but his family members prove their integrity by telling him that it would be impossible for him to sell a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. However, we go through the rest of the movie without a test of integrity for all of the other children. Why? We are left to assume that they were all ugly and obnoxious and without any redeeming qualities. Augustus may be a glutton, but we weren't shown any other failings. In the original, we got some peeks at what Charlie and his grandpa thought about the other kids' obnoxious behaviors, but not so in this movie. It seems that obnoxious behavior is normal and results in mistakes rather than revealing them as life-long character flaws.<br/><br/>While some elements of this movie were presented in the same manner as the original, the lack of charm and pacing in this movie made me understand how the original movie provided an overall better effect (except for the FX). I just wasn't impressed with this movie. Every other movie that I have seen Tim Burton make is a good or great movie. And, every other character Johnny Depp has created has been dead-on and quite often original. This movie experience is so-so. I give it a 6 for special effects."
"ilinx","5","0","2","21 July 2005"," 50% Fail 50% Nail
","I give this movie a 5 because I'm pretty split in my reaction. I think it nails the spirit of the book in just about half it's elements and fails in the other half. Charlie and the Chocolate Factory was one of my very favorite books growing up, so no movie could ever do the story justice in my mind, but it is the kind of story that begs to become a film. I own the earlier film version, and think it's cute, but was never satisfied by it, not even close. I think this film comes closer to the character of the book, and visually it can be quite stunning. The greatest thing going for this film is the actor that plays Charlie. He is perfect! Actually, most of the actors are perfectly cast...but I was surprised by Depp's performance...it was by far the worst thing of the entire film! Gene Wilder's Wonka was much better. Where did Depp get this ridiculous interpretation?? If I completely forget that it's supposed to be Wonka, I could consider it amusing at times, but on the whole it is ridiculous and completely un-Dahlesque. I had actually thought the movie was going to suck EXCEPT for him--I love Depp's portrayals, usually. Not this time--this Wonka is petty and hateful. (""Da...daddy??""--ugh) Reminded me more of an Austin Powers Wonka than anything. I think Depp tried a little too hard to make this Wonka ""different."" I also could have done without the musical numbers, but I suppose they were too hard to pass up. As a side-comment, this film really brings the capitalist and colonialist subtexts of the book to the surface in a much more explicit way than the first version."

","After reading postings here, I grabbed my 5 and 7 year old to the Theater to catch this flick. But throughout the whole movie - I'm like - this is a weird movie. Don't get me wrong - I like weird movies and frequent the theaters a lot so have a wide spectrum of film under my belt. But this one must have been awkward for kids as well. As I was watching the faces of many children in the theater, they all had that perplexed/confused stare about them. I actually saw a few wince at some of the scary parts and sat motionless at the funny/nice parts. It just doesn't capture it. I can't put my finger on it - but I left the theater wondering what that was about. They spend a lot of time showing how awful the other children are and no time spelling out the lesson - just disposing of the character. Wondering really if any of them learned their lesson. Depp as Wonka was hard to swallow - he was just plain creepy and reminded me of what Jacko would be like in Neverland. Eep. I always respected the IMDb community, but you guys are too easy on this film. Must be the lack of good movies out there and we are showing our desperation. I'd pass on this film."

","Tim Burton usually creates wonderful fantasy movies but this time he adds an extra layer that lifts it above his previous work. Part of this comes from the story by Roald Dahl, but here he squeezes everything out of it and then some.<br/><br/>Chocolate making serves here in the story and movie as a metaphor for creative thinking. Four children represent a characteristic that hinders creative thinking: greed, excessive competitiveness, money and science. Each is eliminated in the road to creativity except for a heart (family values). These are incorporated in the end to give sense to the creative process. One level higher we have Johnny Depp as the creative actor and Tim Burton as the creative moviemaker. Both face the same obstacles as Willy Wonka; Tim Burton is Willy Wonka to be more precise.<br/><br/>The movie resembles and refers to The Wizard of Oz in its sets and music. And there is a nice reference to 2001 when Mike Teavee is made shorter, 2001 being one of the most creative movies ever made. The criticism of TV is still up to date nowadays.<br/><br/>This succeeds also thanks to the wonderful work of the production and art departments but it is the cinematography of Philippe Rousselot that gives the movie something extras in shaping the worlds. Once he did Diva, a movie that redefined existing art direction. The enormous color contrast between the gray cities and the colorful sets enhance the experience here.<br/><br/>Anyone who thinks this is about Jackson hasn't got the message. Besides that Burton has clearly dismissed all references. There is however a short dance by one of the children that resembles Jackson's and the interpretation of his role by Depp makes all the gossip somewhat understandable.<br/><br/>The songs are not the most creative parts and somewhat repetitious. They could have edited this to a shorter movie. Why do most movie makers still think that more is more?"

I don't see the Michael Jackson reference at all, apart from the loner/hermit mentality, Michael Jackson claims to love children, this one loathes them. It's kinda weird to see the book come to life, as opposed to a true remake, and quite frankly at the end,which I cry at EVERY TIME I see the original, just left me a bit empty.

","Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is not a remake, nor is it a new concept. It goes by the book and is highly effective. The beginning is very dreary but in a good way, and the children in the movie play their parts to a T. Charlie getting his ticket was a little dull, but the second the factory gates open, the madness arrives. If you have seen Fear and Loathing In Las Vegas, you will know how far Depp can take a drug role. Johnny Depp adds so much to the role of Willy Wonka, almost taking another role: Michael Jackson. With weird comments like ""come try my grass"" and ""don't touch the squirrel's nuts"", this movie gets more stars just for making me laugh. I do not think this is a children's movie though. Most of the jokes will fly right over their heads, and the whole sub-plot of Wonka's parent-problem will confuse most adolescents. Byee ~EtHaN"
"TopSpecial","6","0","3","19 July 2005"," Not Bad, But Definitely Overrated By Critics
","Well, I can say with great certainty that Burton's ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" won't be making my Top 3 (Tim Burton) list. MILDLY SPOILERISH...<br/><br/>A familiarity has set in, and I don't just mean in relation to this being a new take on the original novel, first made into a film with Gene Wilder in 1971. No, I'm speaking of Tim Burton's work, which has become so predictable, in style and technique, as to be borderline rote...the same might be said of Danny Elfman's work here. There are no surprises in construction or execution of the film, and though Depp conveys a degree of spontaneity, his character is so (to quote my friend who saw the film with me) ""socially retarded"" that it ends up making almost the entire enterprise feel awkward and stilted as well. My friend was looking forward to a ""bizarre"" performance from Depp, but she got a different kind of bizarre than she was looking for. If he'd scaled his body language and line deliveries back a tad, it would've made a huge difference. Consider how he played the eccentric, cross-dressing Ed Wood relatively straight, and you'll get where I'm coming from.<br/><br/>This is not a bad film, merely an OK one. It doesn't generate a bunch of unintentional humour (like ""Fantastic Four""), but a surprising number of tag-lines fall flat. Willy Wonka relates to pretty much all the kids in a one-note fashion, shutting them down instantly the moment they begin to question his methods...it's pretty tough to sustain a film by having what is ostensibly the lead character perpetually avoiding everyone around him, socially. Visually, the film feels strangely sterile at times, due in no small part to the overabundance of rather flat CGI backgrounds...that's right, one of the few ways that this film differs from most other Burton efforts proves to be a negative as well. Also, the kids don't interact with the ""real"" backgrounds nearly enough, further heightening this feeling.<br/><br/>The scenes with the Buckets work just fine, and David Kelly is very good as Charlie's grandfather. Freddy Highmore is solid in playing what is essentially a blandly moralistic character. The set design on their house redefines dilapidated, but is really too much of a (again, predictable) wink to the audience to prove effective in conveying just how dirt poor this family is (apparently, in the book, you really feel it).<br/><br/>The introductions of the other kids are fitfully amusing (esp. Augustus Goop), but Burton certainly went out of his way in establishing the broadest caricatures imaginable. By the time they meet their imminent fates, you might be secretly wishing they'd just get it over with (particularly in regards to the annoying -- and not much else -- Mike TeaVee (sp?)). It should be noted, though, that the Squirrel Room in this version is a definite improvement over the Egg Room of the Wilder version...appropriately twisted, though way too drawn out from a logistical standpoint (Veruca's father has oodles of time to come to her rescue, if he'd only hop over a five-foot barrier).<br/><br/>The film focuses much less time than the Gene Wilder version on the pre-Chocolate Factory section, essentially meaning there's less in the way of cultural satire. It does seem to have a little more momentum than the latter, which, in retrospect, felt a little static at times. The Oompa Loompa songs are (mostly) lyrically derived from the book, and each of the four main ones draws from a different musical era...the choreography and editing is decent, the songs instantly forgettable (and may prove intolerable for some folks). Deep Roy (who plays all the Oompa Loompas) has a certain physical presence which plays off Depp's Wonka reasonably well.<br/><br/>You begin to think that the film is approaching its end too quickly, only to realize that an unneeded (though mildly amusing) sub-plot is being served, setting up a rather pat ending.<br/><br/>Anyways, I went into the film expecting a B, and came away with something in between a C+ and B-...so I'll say (just barely) 2 1/2 Stars-out-of-4. If you're ""on the fence"" about seeing this one, wait for the DVD."

","Tim Burton has done it again. Johnny Depp nailed Willy Wonka on the head. No, he was not Gene Wilder, but he was equally as effective in the role. Danny Elfman has once again given us one of the best musical scores I've heard in years! It was crazy, yet had sentimental moments that added to the sympathetic moments with Charlie Bucket. This was very close to the original novel, with the exception of a few minor details, most notably Wonka's dentist father storyline, but it isn't something that will make or break the film. What makes the film is Burton's bizarre abstract style of story telling- and this film was the perfect palette for his insane creativity. I honestly haven't seen Burton be this creative since one of his earlier films, Beetlejuice. It was also just as good, if not better than Edward Scissorhands, although doesn't compare to his best work for me being Big Fish. Yet this movie was sure cinematic entertainment and the smile never left my face, and neither did my laughter. Danny Elfman did a wonderful job with the Oompa Loompa songs. He added in a different styled song for each time they burst out, and it was a nice change and kept you from lapsing into boredom. Many people have been criticizing Elfman for the crappy lyrics he wrote for the film: Elfman did not write the lyrics- they were the same lyrics to the Oompa Loompa songs that were in the original novel written by Roald Dahl. That was a very smart move for Burton and Elfman and it worked perfectly.<br/><br/>This film and the original 1971 film Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory are two completely different movies. As much as I loved the original, I have come to realize that this film is a much better version because it holds true to the novel and themes and everything seems to work better. Those who hate this film are comparing it too closely to the original when the original shouldn't even be considered at all due to the fact it barely remains true to the Roald Dahl vision ( why else would he despise the 1971 film version for? )<br/><br/>Tim Burton is one of the best directors in Hollywood today. This film proves why he is one of the best! This was, simply put, one of the best experiences I have had in a movie theater this year along with Batman Begins. A true 10 Star film!"
"Wills67","7","0","2","18 July 2005"," Wonka a triumph... excluding the songs.
","Johnny Deep does a wonderful job, and continues to impress his versatility on moviegoers in ""Willy Wonka and the Chocalate Factory"". Similarly, Tim Burton gives us all we would expect along the lines of creativity. The children in the move were especially impressive in the individual styles they portrayed. I probably could have watched a whole movie about the fat German kid. Anyway, the film is much truer to the book than the 1971 version, so you can take that for what its worth. The MAJOR detraction from my viewing experience was the umpa-lumpas or, rather, the terrible songs they sang. Danny Elfman (music) is usually a tremendous addition to the movies and series he is involved with, but I would say that his work with these songs downgraded the entire film. They were mesmerizingly corny, each trying to touch upon different genres of popular music. They were long and overemphasized as well. Elfman is a very talented composer, but he leaves much to be desired in his lyrics. I might be alone in this, but I don't much care for watching and listening to hundreds of little umpa-lumpas in tight latex choreographed like a highschool musical and dancing to crappy songs. I am going on about this because I think the songs shrink the potentially broad age-range that would enjoy the film. Otherwise, it's a great movie. I could go into all the things I liked about the movie, but I'm sure they are all covered in other reviews. Rock an roll."
"Wolf30x","Null","0","1","16 July 2005"," the best family film of the year
","Its rare to find a family film that is barely tolerable enough to see if you're not bringing little ones along, but Burton's version of this Roald Dahl classic is so well executed that grown ups will forget they're not the target audience. Don't get me wrong though, it's still appropriate for kids, (arguably more so than the nightmarish Willy Wonka and the Chocholate Factory,).<br/><br/>Right from the start, the film grabs your attention, when see Wonka's chocolate bars being made in a manner that is strangely ominous, and from there it just hits the ground running. With the exception of Charlie, the other four winners of the Golden Ticket contest are brilliant over-the-top exaggerations of the result of bad parenting yet at the same time come off as believably realistic.<br/><br/>While Freddie Highmore does an excellent job as Charlie Bucket, Johnny Depp and Deep Roy both manage to steal the show. Depp's version of Willy Wonka manages to have just the perfect amount of quirkiness to him without being cartoonish, and thankfully has none of the eerie maniacal undertones of Gene Wilder's version. And perfectly complementing Depp is Deep Roy as the oompa loompas. Instead of the psychedelic orange skinned midgets most people think of, Burton has made them a tribe of strangely identical miniature jungle woodsmen. And believe me, these little fellows do everything from being vinyl clad workers to synchronized swimmers to heavy metal rockers.<br/><br/>All in all, this film is a must-see for any fan of Tim Burton, Roald Dahl or just anybody looking for a solid two hours of escapist fun."
"misterembryo","8","0","3","16 July 2005"," Want a golden ticket? Watch this movie.
","Whether it was the nostalgia of incredible feats of imagination brought about by the original or the curiosity of witnessing Wonka's factory for the first time, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory offers sufficient amounts of creativity and humor to live up to the precedent set by the classic Willy Wonka film, and at the same time is charming enough to win the hearts of anyone witnessing its magic for the first time. Although words like ""imagination"" and ""magic"" may be concepts that will stray some moviegoers away, the sarcasm, wit, brutal honesty, and the ironic mocking of family movies makes ""something for everyone"" a valid statement. The hardest part for any remake is of course living up to the expectations of the classic and at the same time setting itself apart from the original. Charlie and the Chocolate Factory stays true to the original but surprisingly at the same time has so much more to offer.<br/><br/>And now the necessary recap for those who have no idea what all the hype is about. Willy Wonka (Johnny Depp, duh) is a recluse who hasn't seen the light of day for years, as shown in his pale complexion. Suddenly a contest is announced sending 5 golden tickets around the world granting access to his bizarre factory with only one contestant winning a lifetime supply of chocolate and a mysterious grand prize. Charlie (Freddie Highman, Finding Neverland) is a young boy with grand hopes but a tiny grotesque house where the soup of the day everyday is cabbage soup. His emotions are in a whirl as Golden Tickets quickly run out and his bedridden relatives debate more and more regarding the issue of finding a golden ticket.<br/><br/>All of this may be deja vu to some, but Tim Burton's vision, Johnny Depp's talent, and John August's memorable screenplay should not be overlooked. Besides the change in title, this really is a different movie. An obvious change from the original over thirty years later, is the advancements in special effects. The classic Wonka movie was an amazing display of innovation considering its time period. With our age of computer generated imagery, movies can either look breathtaking or they can look like crap. Tim Burton doesn't overuse the c.g.i. in this film thus preserving the film's beauty and focus on the characters.<br/><br/>Another good decision was using a live actor to play the oompa loompas rather than using more c.g.i. At first I was taken aback when there was an absence of orange midgets in overalls. However, the performances by Deep Roy as all the oompa loompas were actually some of the most entertaining parts of the movie. With the wide variety of musical styles provided by Danny Elfman, Roy was able to display his true versatility: ranging from Latin dance to hip hop to 60's acid rock. The movie even points out how random and choreographed those musical numbers seemed to be. And if the musical numbers don't meet your oompa loompa fix, the movie even provides a history behind how the oompa loompas came to be employed under Willy Wonka.<br/><br/>This leads to the next major characteristic of the film: the depth it went into the lives and personalities of each character. Everyone was perfectly casted and even the minor characters had more of a voice. The bedridden elders for example make the scenes at Charlie's home more enjoyable. In this film, Grandpa Joe isn't the only one with a voice. More detail was also put into the other kids, more personality and more depth into how they got their ticket and what they plan to do with their prize. Another noticeable difference is the presentation of Wonka from Johnny Depp compared to Gene Wilde. They both seem to be really eccentric individuals and both seem to show a lack of interest to the kids on the tour, but they also have their major differences.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp as always delivered a classic performance and a character that sets itself apart from other roles. Wonka was depicted as a merry Mister Rogers type who also has the bitterness of Dr. Evil yet the enthusiasm of Ed Wood. Wonka seemed to take pride in his work, but at the same time lacked confidence in himself and showed signs of insecurity, often bringing out index cards for everything he wants to say- a major transition from the aggressiveness of the original Wonka. This may be attributed to the history behind Wonka and his factory which is revealed more and more as the film progresses.<br/><br/>The film understands that they are taking on a project that is regarded as untouchable. Willy Wonka isn't the same, oompa loompas aren't orange and there is no bubbly soda that makes you float to the ceiling. This is because these are aspects of the original that are reserved for the original. Instead regard these as two separate movies. This is not a musical but instead an epic film that goes deep into the heart of the story and the characters, most importantly Willy Wonka himself.<br/><br/>This is another Burton and Depp collaboration that won't fail to please and to entertain and to wow the audiences. If you don't care about anything I said, just know that this is a memorable movie that won't be a waste of your precious time and money. With it you'll be purchasing hilarious moments and large quantities of creativity, the very substance that made us fall in love with the world of Wonka to begin with."

","People need to understand that this movie is not the first one with Gene Wilder, I see all these reviews comparing it to the old movie, and that's just not fair, this is not a remake of that movie, it's another stab at making a movie out of the book, and people need to take that into consideration. I loved the grimness of the movie, because in reality, the original Wonka book was not as happy go lucky as people think and how the first movie was extremely sugarcoated, also, the situations like the puppets singing and then bursting into fire and melting is a pure spoof of Disney's "" It's A Small World"" and them melting is just a Burton kind of thing, and they even take it further and have a "" puppet burn center"" which I thought was very witty. You cannot compare Depp to Wilder, they both have two different portrayals, and although Depp did seem weird in a few spots, I thought many of his idiosyncrasies were extremely funny and he had the whole theater laughing, but it's true, the movie is grim and anybody under let's say 6, might not understand the irony and jokes and some part may scare them, like the puppets burning, so parents take notice, otherwise I recommend this to old and young alike, and I also like this movie far more than the original as it actually showed that all the children survived, disfigured, but survived, something that always bugged me about the first movie as it didn't reveal the children's fate, another not, most of the Oompa Loompa songs I believe are Dahl's original songs, or at least the lyrics are, anyways, a great acting, great cast, and surely this will become a pop culture icon movie like Burton's other film, A Nightmare Before Christmas."
"yeldrig_yar","7","0","1","17 July 2005"," Fun Movie, But Still Not As Good as Wilder
","I saw the movie this weekend and really, really enjoyed it. Burton achieves so much more visually and with the script than the earlier version. However, I came away favoring the Gene Wilder version over the Johnny Depp version.<br/><br/>Primarily, it was because with the Gene Wilder version, you could tell that everything that happened with the children and their parents was known to Wonka. It was a if every single event and utterance had been pre-scripted by Wonka and the visitors were merely acting out their assigned roles--even if they were unaware that they had been assigned parts. Wonka was a bit snide, more than a bit pixie-ish; he was displaying all these wonderful toys, events, and observations and was just *hoping* that someone would notice. But, of course, no one did because they were too greedy and too preoccupied with stealing the secret for Slugworth. Everyone, that is, except Charlie and Grandpa Joe...And we soon learn that Wonka (the Gene Wilder one) knew that Charlie would be the winner and, in fact, planned it that way up to and including the final test.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp's character, however, was simply neurotic. He didn't know of the children (Gene Wilder knew all about them). Depp's character was lost in his own factory, surprised when one of the children acted up, was childishly enraptured with the Oompa Loompa songs, and seemed startled to discover that--suddenly--Charlie was the only survivor. Furthermore, he was genuinely shocked when Charlie valued family over candy. His repeated ""interactions"" with the glass elevator didn't help at all.<br/><br/>Additionally, the movie seemed forced to super speed. The kids were hardly in the place before they started being eliminated. We really got to know and despise the kids in the older movie...here, they almost seemed as afterthoughts. It is true that the older movie seemed to take about 2.5 hours just to GET to the factory, but it made the elimination of the kids all the more pleasant.<br/><br/>And the Oompa Loompas? Great concept. However, I have no idea what they were singing during their songs. Loud, raucous, grating rock-and-roll presented at hyperspeed? Danny Elfman is a master, but that was a poor, poor choice of presentation. I'd almost rather have not had any musical interludes at all.<br/><br/>On the plus side (and there were plenty). I loved the Wonkitania boat (although I loved the older boat ride...much creepier than this one was exciting), loved the squirrels, the Oompa Loompas, Charlie's relationship to his family. The chocolate room was lush (although brief, brief, brief compared to the older movie), the children and parents were absolutely delightful and spot-on with their portrayals (we just didn't have much time to get to know and hate them), and the backstory about Willy and his dad was a nice addition.<br/><br/>So...it was not (in my opinion) a bad movie. By itself, there's nothing to not like (except maybe the Oompa songs). But when compared to the older movie...well...I'm pretty sure that any of my return visits to Wonkaland will have Gene Wilder as my host."

","First of all, I must admit, I am a huge fan of the original and I saw Roper and Ebert's review prior to seeing the film so this did influence some of my review. When I first heard this film was being done again, I was very excited to see a new interpretation, than I found out it was being re-done by the creep show that is Tim Burton and Johnny Depp, I saw the trailer and felt this was nothing but a recipe to butcher one of my favorite movies. Still, I had to go see it. The visuals are very interesting and the acting with the exception of Depp is very good. I would call it an interesting film for the most part, just from the point of view that it allows you to see another interpretation. Tim Burton however is totally out of line by claiming he is all high and mighty for doing a closer version of the book than Mel Stuart had. He did use squirrels instead of Geese, and he included the father working in a toothpaste factory. However, he has in fact deviated more from the book than the original by adding all that unnecessary gar-badge about Wonka's father and childhood, and then totally changing the ending by suggesting, Wonka ever refused Charlie's family into the factory. That's all rubbish. He also kept in Mel Stuart's concept a phony golden ticket....also not in the book, so you can basically file Burton's claims that the original had no influence on him as gar-badge. Johnny Depp is a talented guy, but this performance is brutal. He's Edward Scissorhands meets Michael Jackson. Overall, worth seeing, but just be aware of that Burton's claims of sticking to the book are full of baloney, and you have to accept Depp's unwatchable performance."
"chicagoisforlovers","9","0","1","16 July 2005"," Even better than I anticipated
","I was extremely excited for the opening of this film, as I love Johnny Depp's movies and always appreciate Tim Burton's creative spin on things. I think they both out did themselves. I try to not compare it with the first movie, because the Burton version is clearly based off the book, but I found this movie better than the original. Mainly because the first Willy Wonka movie scared me to death. Now I thought with the second one, Burton would attempt to be creepy, but rarely was I spooked throughout the film. I was surprised that people brought their children while waiting for the film to begin, yet the film proved to be true to it's PG rating. The only thing is most of the jokes are better appreciated by viewer's old enough to understand irony, the social awkwardness of Willy Wonka, the sassiness of the grandparents, etc. But I found that the kids in the theater would laugh at different outcomes of the children, and one adorable boy next to me gasped with horror and suspense when Charlie attempts to open the candy bars. Each actor did a fantastic job, from Depp to the Ompaa Loompa, played by one guy. I thought the children were cast perfectly. Freddie Highmore is incredibly precious, and notably I thought the girl who played Veruca Salt was perfect. Stylistically, it's pure Burton, and every single shot and scene is so detailed and constructed with such visual stimulation, nothing is left out. I'd see it for that purpose alone! Adding a background to Willy Wonka's life seemed risky, but in the end made the character much more endearing, less odd. Depp does a really great job at making him come to life, and what's so great about Johnny Depp as an actor is despite the fact that he's a huge star, I don't feel like I'm watching a big name actor try to be someone else. He is still able to turn himself into the entire character. I knew the movie would be entertaining, but I did not think it would be so funny. I laughed out loud at so much. The oompa loompa songs are actually quite catchy, and the oompa loompa are not as creepy as the first film. Furthermore, the music composition by Elfman is of course, genius. Overall, you can see a lot of effort was put into the film and it truly paid off. I really hope for some Oscar nominations for this one, even if it's a silly movie, everything was done beautifully."

I like how in this movie they go more into the story on how Willy wonka became. Following the books storyline was a much better decision than to try and remake Jean Wilders movie. Although I hate to say it.. I believe that Johnny Depp is a better Willy Wonka than Jean Wilder. He has more of a Dark sense to him in this movie. You can see a gleam in his eye when some things happen and he just watches in awe instead of minding the madness. I definitely think that if you are a fan of Tim Burton and or the old movie.. you should for sure check this one out. It's awesome. I went to see it on the first night I could see it.. Just when it turned the 15th at midnight.. basically that Thursday night.. I saw it. Man.. was it great. A job well done!"

","i'll admit that i was very excited to see the new remake of this Wonka movie, but when i finally got to view it i became bored by it. Yes the colors were beautiful and Depp was nothing short of amazing, but the movie has no flow. The flashback interrupted the movie and kind of sent it in another direction for those few minutes, when they were over it sent you back into the movie wondering where you left of. The parents of Charlie were great, they looked like if they really would be his parents. As for the oompa loompas they look like modern oompas, and they're songs were boring. I'm a BIG Tim Burton fan but i prefer Big Fish over this. I'm not saying not to watch this, because i still think people should experience this visual beauty- just don't have high expectations."

","I never expected this to be a good movie. I love Gene Kelly, & the 1971 version of Willy Wonka, so the only reason I wanted to see it was because I love Johnny Depp's acting. I am now so sorry that I doubted his acting abilities. Everything was amazing! I and all my friends that came along laughed constantly, and hard, and were very impressed. To quote Dallin, ""That is the *BEST* movie I've seen in a very long time!"" I agree whole heartedly. There are many many memorable quotes, and many new ones. Even if the oompah-loompahs aren't traditional & the songs aren't quite the same, this movie is a must see! I'm going to buy it as soon as it comes on sale. Everything was original, unique, modernized, while still holding on the traditional ideas of who Willy Wonka is. And yay for the glass elevator!"

","Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is ten times better than Willy Wonka and the chocolate factory. Johnny depp plays a cunning and marvelous portrayal of Willy wonka. He molds to his character and plays him perfectly. It is safe to say his performance in this movie is just as good as his performance in pirates. Just another example that he is the best actor of our generation.Not to mention the child actors are equally excellent in their roles especially Freddie Highmore.Deep Roy also looks like a perfect oompa loompa. Tim Burton does an excellent job with the visuals in the movie and makes everything so realistic.This movie is surely going to be one of the biggest hits of the summer. I will definitely go to theaters and watch it again!"
"hdumont","7","0","3","18 July 2005"," Lovers of the original, beware!
","When I first saw the previews for 'Charlie', I swore to never watch it. As a big fan of Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, I couldn't get over the fact that Tim Burton, of all directors, was going to try and ""remake"" such a classic! However, on 'date night' my husband cast aside interesting choices such as ""Fantastic Four"" and ""Wedding Crashers"" and gave me a choice of ""Charlie"" and ""War of the Worlds"". So admittedly, I dragged my reluctant behind into the theatre.<br/><br/>Not being a big Tim Burton fan, I was a little worried.<br/><br/>Let me just say if you love the old version, DO NOT COMPARE 'WILLY' and 'CHARLIE'! They shouldn't be compared, they should both be embraced as incredible masterpieces. Roald Dahl's book is fabulous, and both movies have that flair.<br/><br/>That being said, it's absolutely impossible not to compare the two.<br/><br/>While Gene Wilder brought an eccentric and enjoyable Wonka to the screen, Depp's character spins an oddly perverted Wonka and just rubs you the wrong way. He never quite looses that vaseline-tooth smile, or that ""Where the hell am I?"" look in his eyes. <br/><br/>Charlie was horribly cast. I'm sure that after Finding Neverland, Burton felt that Depp had true stage chemistry with Freddie Highmore, but I don't think that's the case. Charlie had no soul, he just stood there, breathing through an open mouth. And just as a personal annoyance, when you find $10 in the street and spend $.25 on a candy bar, get your change. Your eating cabbage soup for dinner 7 nights a week and you are going to leave $9.75 on the counter at the newspaper stand? Ugh.<br/><br/>Grandpa Joe was horribly cast. He and Charlie didn't interact at all, he was just there to take up space on camera. <br/><br/>If you've ever seen a black and white photograph digitally ""colored"", you'll know what I mean when I say Augustus Gloop looked just like that. His skin was perfect and pale, his lips a luscious pink, his hair golden blonde. Way too much make up and/or digital enhancement. Why they spent so much time on Gloop, I'll never know. Veruca was acceptable as a bratty snot. Violet was acceptable as the gum chewing, competitive type - in fact her 2005 character was a lot more competitive than her 1971 counterpart which helped tremendously. Her mother had that odd, recognizable yet unplaceable look to her - until I IMDb'd her and realized I knew her from Dodgeball as Fran, the unibrowed Slavic woman. Ewww. She did nothing but make googly eyes at all the men on screen, well as googly as you can make the eyes of a psychotic crazed killer on crack. I don't know who creeped you out more - Violet's mom, Wonka or worse yet - the two of them flirting in the most deranged manner I've seen since .. since .. well, ever. Oh, and does any one really care about Mike Teavee?<br/><br/>Which is more expensive, paying 50 little people to paint their faces orange and dance around, or digitally multiplying the same little man thousands and millions of times? I don't care about the answer, nor do I care for the latter.<br/><br/>And the songs, oh Lordy Lordy the songs. <br/><br/>While neither movie is entirely true to the book, the films choose different parts of the book to highlight which I think is fabulous.<br/><br/>That being said, Dahl's Charlie is probably the only film that not even Tim Burton can ruin. I give it 7 out of 10 stars, would recommend it to anyone and will never watch it again."
"vincent-100","7","0","4","18 July 2005"," Inferior to the original
","Tim Burton's Willie Wonka was a typically fantastical treatment of an old favourite. Burton did not disappoint, and the movie had that Edward Scissorhands/Batman feel to it; bright colours and new and fewer songs. The kids were cast perfectly. The grandparents were fine, and as for Charlie's parents, what's Helena Bonham Carter doing in the film? It's a vacuous role for her, and she has Tech Support as a husband which distracted me somewhat.<br/><br/>The movie is great, but there is one obvious flaw. In the original, spies approach all the kids before they go into the factory, and offer the kids huge amounts of money if they betray Wonka's secrets to them. In the end, Wonka turns a mistake Charlie made against him and asks Charlie to leave the factory. Charlie has to make a decision, and he returns Wonka's Everlasting Gobstopper. Because of this virtuous act of Charlie, he demonstrates that he is worthy. The spy turns out to be fake, and it is reveled that it was all part of Wonka's plan.<br/><br/>I thought that Burton's movie was going in that direction. His Wonka seemed a little tipsy, and I thought it was part of a plan to make the spies think he was going crazy. That would explain why he kept emphasising how the waterfall churns the chocolate; like he wanted the rotten apples to tell the spies that. But in the end, Wonka really was crazy. He has to go to therapy to understand Charlie's virtuosity. What does Charlie do to earn the factory? Apart from not abandoning his family (a virtue demonstrated by the original Charlie), nothing. He's just the last one left of the bunch. The original was a lesson in good deeds and integrity. Burton's was an opportunity to use special effects not available before, and to give Depp another nice character to play. That is a pity. Burton is capable of delivering a strong message through strange characters. Just look at Edward Scissorhands."

","With today's technology and acceptance of many different creative directions in film art, this movie does have it's accomplishments. Trying to ""remake"" the fantastic Willie Wonka movie in Tim Burton style was a downer for me and my party. Many things seemed out of place --""why did he put that in there??"" and many characters and elements of the original movie where duplicated in a strange sort of way that I'm sure Burton enjoyed, but...what about the rest of us.

So when I got the chance to see the movie, I took it with open arms and I loved it.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp playing the eccentric Willy Wonka did a terrific job giving hilarious one-liners during the movie. Sometimes he is strangely similar to Micheal Jackson, but we can all laugh this time around. Wonka was a little bit more evil and crazy than I can seem to remember of the book, thus making the movie even funnier.<br/><br/>And those Oompa Loompas surely were incredibly fun to watch. They were stylish.

"alainsane","7","0","1","17 July 2005"," A Little Nonsense Now and Then Relished By the Wisest Man
","There are two ways to take Charlie and the Chocolate Factory with respect to this review's title: a line sung by Gene Wilder's Wonka in the original, Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory. The first is that even though the remake is largely nonsensical (not just a little bit), it is still relishable when placed in the spectrum of all of life's gravity.<br/><br/>Indeed, Johnny Depp's impish characterization of Wonka plays very well to children--much better than to adults; though, I heard plenty of adults laughing at the pure slapstick of his walking into the invisible doors of the glass elevator....twice! While the visuals are quite remarkable, there is little to hold the movie together besides the storyline of the Dahl book, which honestly, I cannot easily separate from the original movie.<br/><br/>Yes, the same thing could be said about the original; we go from chocolate room to inventing room to golden egg room to TV room with little alacrity. The tonality of those original settings is as disparate as the settings of the remake. The difference--and it's an appreciable one--is that the masterful quality of Gene Wilder's Wonka holds it all together. Even if we feel like we're on a jarring ride in the original, Wilder's cool and collected Wonka assures the audience that it's going to be alright: even if we cannot see how. And in the end, we all are a little wiser for it.<br/><br/>Which brings me around to the second way of taking the subject line: the way Wilder sang about it in the original. We can relish the nonsensical parts of the original because they are juxtaposed so finely by the menacing wit of the rest of the movie. This juxtaposition simply isn't possible until the very end of the remake.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp's characterization of Wonka isn't bad, so much as his character is written too shallowly. This is never more apparent as when he repeats a none-too-acerbic observation of Mike Teevee's mumbling. Yes, we are led to believe that Depp's Wonka is scatterbrained--as is demonstrated when he launches into a scripted welcome of his guests after the same welcome had already been extended. But this just adds to the remake's inauthenticity, because Depp's Wonka seems acutely incapable of running a chocolate factory: something I never felt about Wilder's Wonka. The redundancy of lines via the scatterbrained characterization of Wonka felt like an intentionally lazy (or impotent) turn by the remake's writers.<br/><br/>There are more loose ends tied up in the remake than the original. We actually see the nasty Wonka kids leaving the factory in their altered states. We find out a little more about how Charlie's family actually makes the move into the factory. We learn how Wonka got into the chocolate business. And, we learn more about the Oompa Loompa's origins; though the surreal nature of the Oompa Loompa's identical appearance makes me almost wish I hadn't. *laughs* All in all, the remake is a little bit of tasty nonsense which I will only relish now and then: not persistently like the original."
"hilouanne","6","0","3","17 July 2005"," Agustus Gloop digitally created?
","My wife suggested to me during the movie that Augustus seemed like an animated character so we were both paying very close attention to this during the show. Neither of us had heard this mentioned from anyone prior to the seeing the movie. It is very suspicious that there seems to be no other information available about this so called Philip Wiegratz. Apparently, there is also some confusion about his age and where he is from. It would be very politically correct and believable that Hollywood would create a digitized character for a child who is ridiculed to this extent. The whole thing seems very ""simone-esque"". <br/><br/>Anyone know anything?"
"HaiWolfe","7","0","1","17 July 2005"," A fun summer movie with enough humor to keep viewers of all ages entertained.
","It probably bears mentioning at the onset that this latest creation by director Tim Burton (of Edward Scissorhands and The Nightmare Before Christmas fame) is not a remake of the 1971 movie, but rather a fresh reinterpretation of children's author Roald Dahl's original book, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.<br/><br/>I've only seen parts of the older movie years ago, but from what I've heard, Burton's take is somewhat darker and more bizarre. If so, it's not necessarily a bad thing; after all, Dahl was known for writing about nasty things happening to children in all his stories. That said, I enjoyed Burton's style of visual design, which made for plentiful eye-candy (no pun intended maybe) from start to finish.<br/><br/>The movie started off strongly with a fantastic score by Danny Elfman to accompany its title sequence. In fact, I wish we could have heard more of that one particular part of the score throughout - an energizing composition of broad orchestral instrumentation coupled with mechanical effects that so perfectly encapsulated the mystery, mayhem, and mischief of the factory.<br/><br/>In contrast, I wasn't terribly fond of the Oompa-Loompas' musical numbers or their costume design. Give us quirky characters dressed in their native garb from the book, please, not clones in skin-tight plastic suits! <br/><br/>Actors Johnny Depp and Freddy Highmore, who were last seen in Finding Neverland, team up once more to form a believable rapport on screen. Depp, true to his character acting form, is reported to have modeled his interpretation of Willy Wonka after part mad-genius inventor Howard Hughes and part shock-rocker Marilyn Manson. Highmore performed admirably, with some of his best moments in the beginning portion of the movie.<br/><br/>For some reason, they decided to shift the lead character focus from Highmore to Depp halfway through, loading poor Mr. Wonka with some unexpected emotional baggage. I can't decide whether I liked the change they made to the ending or not. Still, at least the movie was amusingly self-deprecating about it: ""Sorry, I was having a flashback."" / ""Does that happen often?"" / ""Increasingly so, today."" <br/><br/>While I sat for close to two hours with a grin on my face, I couldn't help but feel that something was missing or empty about it all. In part, it was because a linear storyline made the watching experience an exercise of counting up to five and then back down to one, but Burton and company are not to blame for it, as they stayed very true to Dahl's original tale. Moreso, any deviations they did make were for the purpose of attempting to add more depth to the story."
"nowhereman86","5","0","1","17 July 2005"," Good Intentions
","I'd like to state first that I liked this movie. It just had a few minor issues. For some reason, Tim Burton has a sick fetish with Johnny Depp. He has now been cast in a leading role in one fourth of Tim Burtons films. Normally I wouldn't have a problem with that. I loved him in ""Ed Wood"" and thought he was perfect in ""Edward Scissorhands"". But he went too far this time. Johnny Depp is not what I would call a ""comic"" actor. His little one-liners began to annoy me about half-way through the film. I don't know if they were trying to capture the magic that Gene Wilder had in the original, but I think they failed miserably. I really have no other complaints besides that. I just wish Tim Burton would stop thinking that it is a requirement to have Johnny Depp in his movies for them to be good."
"thewarmth2003","6","0","1","17 July 2005"," Decent but for a real treat noting beats the original's sweetness..
","I respect Burton's attempt at re-shaping a classic. As re-makes go, it was alright but as a movie by itself, it lacked luster. Nothing was very memorable and Depp came off as a creepy, Micheal Jackson-like character who's weird ways in no way reflect the genius Wonka supposedly has. The Oompa Loompas (or the one guy playing all of them) were very forgettable, and made me long for the rhythmic rhyming of the 70's Loompas. The little comedy that Burton is famous for throwing into his films wasn't very apparent in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and so dumbed down, the moments often went unnoticed. Overall, the film was basically trying to modernize an already great movie for the sake of dollars, banking on Depp's abilities, which unfortunately couldn't bring this rather boring copycat to it's full potential . Gene Wilder hopefully realizes he has nothing to worry about over his title as the one and only Willy Wonka."

","Lest everyone forget, this movie is based on a book. The original movie with Gene Wilder was a creepy and devilish adaptation from the Roal Dahl version. The Golden Goose scene was never in the original book, neither was the whole ""You drank the Fizzy Lifting drink, and therefore you lose!"" Willy Wonka is not evil, and was never meant to be evil. I give Burton props for staying with the text. Also, the playfulness of Johnny Depp made me feel like I left Pirates of the Caribbean, not Sleepy Hollow. I am just sick and tired of everyone comparing it to the 1970s version. If they just remade that movie, it would be boring and unentertaining so back- off!"

","When I first heard Tim Burton was remaking this film, I thought it was a great idea. Then I started seeing the trailers with Johnny Depp, and I began to get a little disappointed. I wasn't very fond of the girlie bob haircut and high voice. I guess that was never the impression I got of Willy Wonka either from the book or from the first movie with Gene Wilder. However, the personality given to the character Willy Wonka by Johnny Depp turned out to be quite fabulous I must admit. It surely was a bit creepy, and a bit insane. Very well done I must say. I guess Depp did a great acting job based on the direction Tim Burton must have given him.<br/><br/>The costumes were tremendous, and Deep Roy as the Oompa Loompa was fantastic. Obviously the scenes with multiple Oompa Loompas were done with the help of CG, but it was done in such a way to almost make each individual move his own.<br/><br/>I can't exactly remember the plot of the original book because I read it about 30 years ago. So the plot of the movie may have been more true to the novel than the original film, I'm not sure. But both films were very similar, with regards to the character development, anyway. I also understand that the Oompa Loompa songs were from lyrics in the novel, too. There wasn't as much singing as the original film, either. Mostly just the Oompa Loompa songs. I rather thought Danny Elfman was going to either re-perform or re-write those songs, but gladly did not.<br/><br/>I went into the theater reluctantly, but was captivated with the drama and utterly in stitches with laughter (as were most everyone else) very early on. People were actually clapping at the end, an event I certainly did NOT witness at the end of Star Wars: Renvenge of the Sith. Definitely one to see on the big screen."

","""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" is certainly not a remake of the Gene Wilder version, but rather a reinterpretation of book by Roald Dahl. Although originally skeptical about the idea of Tim Burton directing, I am delighted to say that he did an amazing job. From the opening titles, Danny Elfman's musical score immediately pulls you into the world of Willy Wonka; Johnny Depp's performance was excellent. <br/><br/>The highlight of the film was its off-beat humor. Many of the jokes were geared toward an adult audience (e.g., when a child asks Mr. Wonka about the contents of the room Wonka responds, ""Everything here is eatable. I'm eatable, but that my children is called cannibalism and it is frowned upon in most societies."" Certainly not your typical fare for a nine-year-old.)<br/><br/>I highly, highly recommend it."

","****Excellent<br/><br/>***Good <br/><br/>**Fair <br/><br/>*Poor <br/><br/>Allow me to begin this review by stating that Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory was and still is my favorite family film. Director Tim Burton is one of my favorite filmmakers and in a way I expected this film to top the original. I guess that's the letdown or disappointment of the film. Nonetheless, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is an amazing film in its own right. Burton is a great artist and once again fills the screen with great imagery. When I was a child I discovered Burton through wonderful films like ""Pee-Wee's Big Adventure,"" ""Beetlejuice,"" ""Edward Scissorhands,"" and of course the Batman films. With Charlie a whole new generation will discover the brilliance of Mr. Burton.<br/><br/>The other highlight of the film for me was the music and songs by Danny Elfman. This is one of his best work in my opinion. The score was very good and the Oompa Loompa songs were great. And the dance numbers were awesome. You know, sometimes I think Tim Burton should do a musical. He always does a good job with musical numbers. Go watch Beetlejuice and even Batman for more prove.<br/><br/>Now, like I mentioned above, the original is still the best in my honest opinion. One of the reason for that is because of Gene Wilder's performance as Willy Wonka. I love Johnny Depp and feel that he did a great job as Wonka. As well as very funny. But, because of his Michael Jackson approach I think Wilder beats him. I also loved the fact that Wilder's Wonka was a lovable a-hole. Wilder's Wonka was horrible to those rotten kids and very sarcastic to the parents. I liked that approach a lot and he was actually a good person at heart. Wilder's Wonka was just mean to those kids and parents cause they deserved it. To Charlie and his family he revealed the real Willy Wonka. And...even though Depp went for the whole creepy Wonka approach I think Wilder beats him at that as well. How can ANYBODY forget the acid trip?<br/><br/>RATING: 4 STARS <br/><br/>Take your kids or younger sibling. The film is fun and I think everyone will enjoy. Then go and buy the DVD for the original film."

","I went to watch this movie not knowing what to expect. I absolutely loved the original Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory movie, and almost didn't want this one to be made because I didn't think anything could compare to the performance of Gene Wilder.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp as Willy Wonka was almost a perfect match, and I became, once again, amazed at his ability to transform into such unusual characters. But even though Depp gave a brilliant performance, Gene Wilder was born to play Willy Wonka and will remain the best-remembered Willy Wonka.<br/><br/>As a movie, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory was fabulous. It delved into the histories of the Oompa Loompas and Willy Wonka, which provided so much insight. I also loved the almost cartoon-like way all the characters looked. There was something in the editing that made the actors seem as if they were drawn.<br/><br/>The most incredible parts of the movie were the breathtaking sceneries and the squirrels. The set was actually built, and the actors weren't just standing in front of a green screen. Movies tend to be much more visually appealing when the set is real, and this movie is no exception. Moreover, squirrels were somehow trained to actually shell nuts while sitting on a little stool and discard the shells. It was amazing, and I doubt it would've had the same affect had the squirrels been all computer-animated.<br/><br/>The only parts in the movie that made me wince were the Oompa Loompas' song sequences. In the original movie there were a lot of songs as well, but the original movie was more of a musical. Everyone sang in it. In this one, it seems as if the movie stops for two minutes just so the audience can see a little Indian man regenerated fifty times, dancing to some bizarre disco music. It was just a little too much for my taste. Willy Wonka's flashbacks also became stale after awhile. Although his history was integral to the plot, I felt as if some more editing could have been done.<br/><br/>All in all though, this is a magnificent movie that everyone can appreciate. Tim Burton does it yet again, and this will probably end up being the movie of the summer."
