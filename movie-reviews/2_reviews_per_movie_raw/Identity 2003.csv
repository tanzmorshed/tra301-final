","OK, everyone seems to be confused about this movie so let me explain it for everyone. The killer has a multiple personality syndrome, and was being treated in a psychiatric home. They have tapes of him portraying many different personalities, and they believe that one of his many personalities is the killer. The reason everyone has the same birthday is that every person is really him, all of these characters are made up in this guys mind. The way they figure they can cure him of his multiple personalities is to have them all come together inside of his head and hopefully they will all be killed off, with the risk that the killer will be one of the personalities killed. Let me repeat, the point of that motel, is to have all the personalities come together hoping that they will all die except for one, that one takes control of his life. As each character dies, that is one less personality he has left. In the very end they think he is OK because all of his personalities are dead, except for the girl. But really that kid is still alive, and he kills Amanda Peet. The exercise that they tried to do was complete, all the personalities died inside of his head, unfortunately the only personality that survived was the one that was the killer. I hope that clears it up a little bit."

","This movie totally surprised me on every level. I had never even heard of it until recently; when an observant video store clerk noticed how many thrillers I was hiring and suggested it. <br/><br/>Having missed it at the movies, I figured it would be the usual B-grade mystery murder flick, a bit of fun at best. Instead this movie had me hooked from the opening sequence; I almost thought they'd put the wrong DVD in the box! <br/><br/>The story is like one big twisted, turning tunnel- with barely a glimmer of a light at the end. The cast is great, the setting appropriately scary- with no short measure of red herrings to keep you guessing. <br/><br/>The cast really delivers too; the characters are diverse and given enough attention to keep you engaged but not so much as to slow the action down. John Cusack is in fine form as the easily likable ex-cop trying to hold it all together; Jake Busey plays the psychotic to perfection as usual. <br/><br/>I don't usually go in for gore, but there's really barely more than a few hints of blood & guts. Definitely one to watch in the dark with a group of friends to scare the hell out of yourselves. You won't regret this one."
"gardenwriter","9","258","310","11 November 2004"," Edge of the seat thriller
","I've never before seen a film that made me sit on the edge of my seat practically from the opening credits. And I never got to sit back.<br/><br/>This was a psychological thriller of the best type. There is plenty of opportunity for you to nominate the ""bad guy"" and while you may be right in a sense you will probably also be wrong. The ending is a real shocker - and I suspect that the typical reaction of many viewers is to say ""No way"" - but if you think about it, it is the only possible ending. But you have to think about it - and the film is so action-filled that you never have time. SO the realization must come after the closing credits roll.<br/><br/>I'd never seen John Cusack in anything but a comedy before (except for a film called ""Max"", but I saw that before I knew who Cusack was). He pulled off drama equally as well as he does comedy. An impressive talent.<br/><br/>And an impressive film."
"bob the moo","Null","84","102","18 April 2004"," The twist is cleverer than the genre should allow but needs you to be totally into the film to accept it - the cast and the direction are both quality in quite an exciting and enjoyable movie
","In the middle of a rainstorm, the judge and lawyers involved in the case of murderer Malcolm Rivers (due for execution the next morning) are called together to discuss evidence that the defence believe had been illegally suppressed.  Meanwhile a series of accidents, damaged phone lines and flooded roads means that a group of strangers are forced to hole up at a motel.  When the prisoner of a cop escapes and a murder occurs, they group together to try and capture him.  However with him dead the deaths continue - each with a room key forming a morbid countdown as the remainder try to survive the night.<br/><br/>For the majority of this film (more or less the first hour) the film is a standard horror thriller that is quite thrilling as the guests are picked off one by one.  However more or less on the hour comes a twist regarding the connection between the guests that is at first silly, but then actually quite clever - even if it takes a bit of swallowing.  From then on it continues in the same vein, with this twist changing our perception of the action onscreen.  I imagine about as many of the audience will scoff at the twist as will accept it and like it.  I liked the twist and thought it was pretty clever even if I have to acknowledge that it is pretty touch and go for a minute or so at least.  The deaths are a mix of gory and shocking (without pushing it to an 18 certificate) and the first hour is pretty effective in terms of tension and drama.<br/><br/>The director opens with several clever shots that freeze frame before moving onto the next scene - this is pretty slick and helps start the film with a good sense of urgency.  His direction within the motel is hardly original but again it works well enough.  The heavy rain serves to put walls around the motel (ie by not being able to see further than the perimeter) and this also increases the tension and the feeling of being trapped.  Of course it's not brilliant as it is really still just a slasher thriller but it is an effective one.  The cast go a long way to helping this by having quite a few big names as well as pretty good performances.  Cusack and Liotta are both good despite the temptation to slum it in this.  They both up the tension and the urgency by their performances.  Peet is the standout from the rest but McGinley, De Mornay and others all do well.  In the hearing Vince is as good as he always is when called upon to do a character with darting eyes and he is effective doing what he does (as little as that is here).<br/><br/>Other than the big name actors, many people will wonder what about this film made it stand out so much that it got good critical reviews.  I think the critical twist will annoy as many people as it pleases and you do need to have been absorbed into the story by the hour mark to really appreciate it. I'm not a big fan of this genre but I enjoyed this movie and suspect that fans of this type of film will as well."
"BrandtSponseller","8","135","175","17 March 2005"," Who Are You? Who who, Who who
","Because of what seem to be unusual circumstances, eleven people, strangers to each other outside of their respective ""groups"" (two families, two professional associations), end up stranded in a desolate Nevada motel on a dark, stormy night. One of the ""strangers"" is a death row murderer being escorted to another prison for execution. When bodies start turning up and the murderer goes missing, he's the obvious suspect. But things are not what they seem. Identity provides a ""double mystery""--a traditional whodunit and an increasingly bizarre ""rubber reality"" mystery that we must figure out along with the characters.<br/><br/>This is my second viewing of Identity. I didn't like it quite as much this time, although it still earned a ""B"". The two aspects I had a slight problem with on the second go-round were one, the plot didn't quite envelop me to the same extent (maybe because I remembered the twist?) and two, since first watching it, I've seen a lot more films in the rubber reality genre, and Identity is nowhere near as mind-bending as many other examples. Still, this is a great film, with a lot of assets.<br/><br/>Director James Mangold effectively employs a number of interesting techniques here. The main standout in the first reel is the use of Tarantino-like ""multiple viewpoint"" shots, where we see the same span of time from one character's point of view, then another, then another. He also effectively creates two very attractive atmospheres, especially for fantasy fans--a ""Twilight Zone""(1959)-like conundrum and a sustained dark ambiance. The Twilight Zone aspect makes itself most obvious beginning with the scene where the convict, Robert Maine (Jake Busey), tries to flee, but discovers that he's still at the motel, after all. The constant, Blade Runner (1982)-like rain underscores the dark ambiance, which is reminiscent of films such as Fallen (1998) and Se7en (1995).<br/><br/>While Identity isn't exactly a bastion of graphic violence, there are a number of strongly visceral scenes and shots that are extremely well done and effective for seeming realistic. The atmosphere is also greatly enhanced by the hotel set, which matches the Bates Motel from Psycho (1960) in dingy gloom. The film also has a wonderfully nihilistic ending.<br/><br/>Even though I wasn't as enraptured in suspense this time, one is still drawn into the film by the gradual quickening and spiraling of loss of control experienced by the characters. While slowly killing each one of them off as they're stuck in an isolated setting is a traditional ""10 Little Indians"" horror film motif that writer Michael Cooney employs, the Twilight Zone aspects allow him to trump the sense of horror and despair, as the surviving characters come to realize that they are not in charge of their own lives, they can't call the shots, and their illusions about their realities crumble before their eyes.<br/><br/>One of the negatives is that the rubber reality resolution is a bit too telegraphed, too overt. The solution is given too early, and ends up being spelled out note-for-note. It's a bit like giving a lecture on a joke right after one gives the punch line. It might be difficult to blame either Cooney or Mangold with this, however, as American film studios and test audiences are notoriously allergic to ambiguity, which is depressing, because I love ambiguity in films. Still, maybe the Identity is just easier to figure out when you've seen tens of rubber reality flicks. When I watched the film upon its theatrical release, I overheard more than one fellow theater-goer still trying to figure out the gist as the lights came up.<br/><br/>One might be tempted to claim that Mangold under-uses his fine cast--who all turn in excellent performances, including one of my favorite character actors, John C. McGinley. But on the other hand, it makes sense that there is this large number and broad range of characters. Under this scenario, you either under-use them or you've got a 3-hour-plus film (not that I'd complain about a 3-hour-plus film).<br/><br/>Of course the theme of the film, as well as all of the subtexts, has to do with personal identity, and especially veiled personal identity. None of the characters are who they seem. Most of them are lying to each other in some way when they first meet, and even some of the ones who know each other already are also lying to each other. Cooney and Mangold explore the various social facts, actions, ceremonies, rituals and so on that help provide personal identity for us, such as birthdates, names, residency, marriages, benevolent versus criminal or unethical actions, and occupations. They also explore a more dynamic identity of action, as relationships continually shift throughout the film."

"alexandros85sof","10","88","116","23 February 2005"," Unpredictable,exciting,full of mystery and horror psychological thriller
","For a start,i would like to say that this film is worth seeing.It is one of the best psychological thrillers that exist so i highly recommend to those who like this kind of movies.The plot was very nice,the twist also and the cast outstanding.Cusack,Liotta,Peet and Hawkes did their best and the result was excellent.I liked a lot the flashbacks that were made -mostly in the beginning. Furthermore,the idea of the whole film was terrific.On the other hand,speaking frankly there was an excessive gore and emphasis on the murders that didn't impress me;a big part of the movie was ""dedicated"" to murders.Another thing that i didn't like was the continuous rain that made me feel tired,seeing again again the storm. Moreover,what i liked most-contrary to many people- was the end of the movie.It was unpredictable and,besides that,it is one of the few thrillers that you cannot find out the end easily.It was very interesting and made me sit tight on my couch .If you don't pay attention for a while you will ""get lost"". I should not forget to refer to the hot presence of Peer that embellished the movie apart from her casting abilities. Lastly,you should make sure that you will be 100% concentrated on the film in order to understand what is happening cause i regard it as one of the most difficult movies to understand.It is certain that this film will dominate you with mystery and in parallel make you think a lot of things that will be predicted wrong in the end. I would give 9 -at least- out of 10 to Identity."
"roblop","10","62","84","18 August 2003"," Identity brings a new meaning to the term ""A Psychological thriller""
","Let me tell you that I will give away nothing about the plot in this review and no spoilers will be included.<br/><br/>The movie is really a multi genre film. Thriller, Suspense, Horror but I would definately put it more into the mystery category.<br/><br/>The story is hard enough to explain but trust me see the movie and you will not regret it.<br/><br/>The acting is perfect, each character is played extremely well by their respective actors, Ray Liotta, John Cusack, Amanda Peet and many others really do make this a top notch movie and one that will keep you guessing right till the final credits.<br/><br/>I must also state that this movie involves one of the biggest twists that I have ever seen in a movie since the sixth sense or even the others. The twist is unforgettable and is enough of a reason to go out and see this amazingly written and directed edge-of-your-seat-thriller.<br/><br/>Let me finish by saying that I gave this movie a perfect 10, you cant beat it and for a genuine shock and thrill see this one because I know that you will enjoy it."
"mbrose","10","33","43","20 September 2003"," Motel as metaphor for rooms in the mind
","SPOILER - Now knowing the ending I find it so clever that the whole movie takes place in a motel and each character has a different room. Even sane people have many different aspects to their personality, but they don't let them become dominant -- they are controlled. Malcolm's various personalities and needs were personified in each character. The prostitute mother (Amanda Peet), the part of him who hated her for being a prostitute (Larry), the loving mother he wish he had, the loving father he wish he had, the selfish part of himself (actress), the violent part of his personality (Ray Liotta and Busey), the irrational emotions he feels and his need to be loved (Ginnie) and his attempts to control those feelings (Lou), the hurt little boy who sees far too many traumatic things in his life, and of course, John Cusack who seems to represent Malcolm himself trying to analyze and understand all the craziness in his mind, tries to follow the rules (accepting responsibility for the car accident), help others (giving Amanda Peet a ride, and stitching up the mother). Very cleverly done!"
"claudio_carvalho","9","111","160","21 August 2004"," Excellent and Intriguing Even When You Watch It For the Second Time
","Today I have watched ""Identity"" for the second time in less than two months, now on DVD. Again, I found it an excellent and intriguing film. There are two versions in the DVD, and I selected the one with scenes that were cut in the final edition (the other option was the theatrical version). Now I paid more attention on the details of the plot, trying to identify flaws in the screenplay, but the story is very tight. There are many extras in the DVD, including deleted scenes, making of, filmography, comments etc. It is amazing the filmography of John Cusack, composed mainly of good movies. I keep my initial vote (nine).<br/><br/>Title (Brazil): `Identidade' (`Identity')"

"jomipira","7","31","48","16 September 2003"," This is NOT a horror movie!
","Identity is not a horror flick. This is a mix of several genres, from thriller, to mystery, a who'dunnit with gore. But still a very surprising movie. Normally I don't respond well to movies who lie to the audience, who show a whole story and suddenly, in the end, without warning just say ""oh well, after all it was nothing like that at all, the guy was just asleep!"". Hitchcock once said you should never lie to an audience, you should never show something that isn't true. It's one thing to tell a lie in a movie, the other is to show it to the audience as if it was the real thing. It's the easiest trick in the book, of course you'll be surprised, anybody will. To understand it better see the difference between ""The Usual Suspects"" and ""Seven"". The first shows a story that wasn't there and in the end pulls a rabbit out of the hat(easy!). The other builds up to an explosive and unexpected finale without any cheap shots, it just carries you through. With Identity the movie suddenly pulls a fast one on you and leaves you wondering... But Mangold doesn't gives the twist at the very end, and keeps a tense film until the last frame. It's a worth see, inventive film and with a great cast to back it up."
"Movie Nuttball","10","82","141","18 September 2003"," Great thrilling horror movie!
","Identity is a very thrilling and spooky film! The all star cast performed very well especially Ray Liotta, John C. McGinley, Amanda Peet, Jake Busey, Pruitt Taylor Vince, and John Cusak! The music by Alan Silvestri was good. The film is a little hard to understand so it not predictable!

","On a dark and stormy night 11 strangers have to take refuge in an isolated motel when a rainstorm turns into a monsoon.  One by one they begin to be killed...but by who and for what reason?<br/><br/>The set-up is neat (if predictable) and there's a great opening showing how the actions of one of them (Amanda Peet) inadvertantly causes some serious damage for the others.  There also is some great acting by Peet, John C. McGinley and Ray Liotta (who REALLY chews the scenery).  There are also some moments that will make you jump and there are two neat twists at the end.<br/><br/>The only bad things about this movie is some clumsy exposition (John Cusack tells his whole life story while photographing a corpse), some truly bad lines and a surprisingly lousy performance by Cusack.  What's happened to him?  He looks worn-out and haggard in this film.<br/><br/>However, these are minor problems and the film is well worth seeing and keeps you guessing about what's going on till the last moment.

"dunmore_ego","7","18","29","29 July 2005"," Identity Cleft
","More than a murder mystery. More than a psychological thriller. More than a horror movie.<br/><br/>With most viewers being either misled by the similarities to Agatha Christie's ""Ten Little Indians"", or just pompously broadcasting their knowledge that this movie was inspired by such, they seem to have missed the point that this was not a ""murder mystery"" per se, but rather, a finely-crafted journey through the mind of a multiple personality during the course of purging his violent personas.<br/><br/>I believe that premise (and its attendant ""twists"") were a TEENSY bit much for audiences to comprehend. Even taking into account the fact that film-makers construct films of this ilk to the whims of ""test-audiences"" and ""focus groups"", (read as lowest common denominators, i.e. swineherders), this particular case still elicits misunderstanding, even WITH the kindergarten paint-by-numbers explanation in the final minutes.<br/><br/>It seemed to be a Patrick-Duffy-shower-scene cop-out, but director James Mangold and writer Michael Cooney, were using sleight-of-hand to misdirect viewers through most of the film.<br/><br/>I envision those loose-lipped test-audiences (comprised of societal castes who have nothing better to do with their Tuesday afternoons) believing that the movie was taking place in real time, only to be chagrined when it is revealed that most of the action was occurring in a psychopath's disturbed mind. Instead of appreciating WHY this filmic device was used, they immediately wished they'd spent their Tuesday afternoon downing that Haagen-Daaz tub and watching McMillan & Wife explain every last G-rated detail to them like they were the last retards on earth.<br/><br/>Ten guests are flood-stranded at a Motel: among them, Rebecca deMornay, almost unrecognizable with her ample boob-job and burgundy hair, playing a character whom she is assuming the mantle of with each passing botox-ed day - a woman who ""used to be that actress""; Amanda Peet, whose stage direction was kept simple - ""Back that booty up some more, honey!""; John C. McGinley playing against type as an uber-dweeb, Jake Busey playing *exactly* his type  uber-psycho; Ray Liotta  always darkly mysterious One by one, these refugee guests start dying all Agatha-Christie-like.<br/><br/>Intercut with this storyline is a somber eleventh-hour appeal by doctors and lawyers to an ill-tempered judge to stay an execution. We are intrigued as to how these two disparate tales are related, but we DO sense a connection in due course, because the dry, somber doctors are talking about a ""killer"" and in that wet parallel Motel story there're KILLIN'S GALORE.<br/><br/>By the end of the second act (after the film's most neck-hair-raising moment, when all the corpses at the Motel are found to be missing), it is revealed that the Motel scenes have been taking place within a psychopath's mind, and that each Motel character was merely one of the multiple personalities of the psychopath.<br/><br/>That's Twist No.1  that all this rain-drenched piling in and out of rooms like the Spanish Inquisition with shocked pusses is merely a psychopath's IMAGINATION.<br/><br/>For a few moments we are led to believe the Shyamalan trap has been sprung  but there's a trump card  through Grand Misdirection on the film-maker's part, the doctors believe they successfully purge the psychopath's mind of his ""killer"" persona, but it is revealed in the last few seconds of film that the psychopath was too adroit in concealing his *real* ""killer"" persona in the form of the least likely hotel guest.<br/><br/>THAT was the true ""twist"" to the movie: discovering that the doctors' cure did not go deep enough; discovering that the psychopath was able to disguise his persona as a benign presence in full view of both the viewers and doctors.<br/><br/>The movie could have opted to wrap neatly with the first Twist, or could have taken any number of juvenile turns, blaming spirits from an Indian Burial Ground, or any of the lesser characters (who all sported damaging secrets), but the writers led us on a merrier, more interesting goose chase.<br/><br/>Thus, this deponent sayeth: Bravo to the road less traveled. <br/><br/>On the other hand, my ""feminine personality"" thought the movie brutalized women too overtly and my ""killer psychopath"" personality is going to make the film-makers pay for giving away my secrets...<br/><br/>(Movie Maniacs, visit: www.poffysmoviemania.com)"
"MissCzarChasm","9","5","6","8 June 2003"," Not Really Scary, Just Good
","A+<br/><br/>Every so often I like to go into films knowing very little about them. It's gratifying not hearing any news stories, or Internet rumors, or early reviews before you see a film because you can genuinely feel surprised by every passing minute of it. In the case of Identity, I only saw a trailer for it once in theatres and I saw various TV spots before its release, but other than that I knew nothing about the core of the story. I went in with no preconceived notions or opinions. For a change I was being a submissive film viewer.<br/><br/>After the credits rolled (by the way I rarely stay until the end of the credits) I was so amazed and surprised by the film that I had just experienced. Identity is a highly original, beautifully constructed, and a mildly scary film that will (excuse my language) do a serious mind f*** on your brain. <br/><br/>The less you know about Identity's plot, the better. This is the kind of film you need to go into knowing very little about. There are a few twists, plenty of scares, and also a very surprising ending that will have some people disappointed, or praising its creativity. I'm definitely in the latter on this one.<br/><br/>Identity is also a masterpiece of atmosphere. Something that I think is the most important aspect of any movie in this genre. Whether it's Halloween, setting the scene for small town horror, or The Ring, drenching us in very dark and Gothic scenery, atmosphere is what makes or breaks a horror film. Thankfully Identity succeeds by creating an atmosphere that is truly frightening and visually impressive. The motel is a perfect setting for the proceedings that take place throughout the night.<br/><br/>A nice ensemble cast rounds out Identity's many incredible attributes. John Cusack gives a very good performance as Ed. Cusack has always been good at playing the 'everyday normal guy' and he uses this to great effect here. It's a layered performance that offers some surprises throughout the picture.<br/><br/>The other high profile performer is the always-reliable Ray Liotta as Rhodes. Liotta never seems to disappoint whenever he's performing, even in sub-par material. He's just as good as he usually is in this picture and he uses his sometimes-abrasive personality to its utmost potential.<br/><br/>Amanda Peet gives her best performance to date as Paris. She has some nice moments where she's allowed sprinkle some comic relief throughout an otherwise dreary picture. However, when she's required to exhibit real fear, she is more than capable. She also shares some good scenes with Cusack during a few key moments in the film.<br/><br/>Clea Duvall and William Lee Scott supply some youth and tenacity as Ginny and Lou. Duvall probably has the role typically called the 'scream queen role' in most horror films and she does well with what she's given. There were times that I could genuinely feel her fear. Scott is given less to do as Lou but he does have some good scenes with Duvall that requires a decent amount of emotion.<br/><br/>John Hawkes and John C. McGinley are also adequate in supporting roles. Hawkes is given a fair share of the comedic lines and for the most part he plays the part well. McGinley fairs better as the husband who must tend for his injured wife and social inadequate stepson. If I felt sympathy for anyone the most, it was his character.<br/><br/>Rebecca Demornay is given very little to do as the failed movie actress but there are some funny jokes made at her expense as one character asks her 'didn't you used to be that actress?' This is some clever commentary on Demornay's obviously fledgling career. The same can be said for Jake Busey as the convict, who is given little to do and seems out of place when paired with the more talented actors in the picture.<br/><br/>What's important is the work these actors do when they're all together. This is very much an ensemble and they play off each other's fear. Their reactions to these situations make the picture all the more frightening.<br/><br/>On the other end of the story, Alfred Molina brings a bit of substance to his role, despite have limited screen time as the psychiatrist and Pruitt Taylor Vance will shock, amaze, and terrify you as the murderer waiting for his execution. Vance's portrayal is very frightening, and an ultimately brilliant performance. Given the limited screen time he does a lot with the role.<br/><br/>Identity is filled with secrets, surprises, and scares that will have moviegoers talking for quite some time. Much like The Ring it has the potential to have some word of mouth appeal. However, don't listen too much to what people have to say about it because it's best to experience this modern masterpiece of fear, knowing very little about it. I guarantee you will be surprised."

","A very well played out movie about a killer with Disociative Identity Disorder. Malcom Rivers remembers his mother as a whore and that he was abandoned at the age of nine and found in a motel. The movie takes that background and sets the scene in the very same atmosphere that Malcom was traumatized in. The movie begins to introduce the differing personalities that were involved in Malcolm's life as a child. The Stepfather who followed the letter of the law almost obsessively compulsive and even recited them. But because his mother was a whore the stepfather only represented the men that he met and tried to be nice to him but never really getting involved. The little boy Timothy who represents the silent killer as his silence denoted that he was only seen and never heard thus representing his abandonment. The actress who was only concerned with herself and basically is a not so nice person, The Driver who is a helper and one who is concerned for people. Other personalities were represented by the Boy and girl named Lou and Jenny who were married young. Lou had a temper and was known for infidelity and jenny who was vindictive and made Lou marry her. Officer Rose and the prisoner who both turned out to be escaped convicts however officer rose turned out to be the ""more evil"" of the two where as the other was a narcissistic know it all. Finally the whore, who stole mens wallets and tried to get out of her life and into a new one. Each character represented fragmentations of personalities that were created inside of Malcolm and Timmy was the personality that killed each one off as retribution to his mother and the atrocities that he encountered at the age of nine. I wish I had more room to write as I can talk about the psychological relations that were represented in each character of the movie all day. Timmy's last words ""whores don't get a second chance"" no doubt referred to his hatred of his mother...and his real life killings represented personalities that he saw in his mother and so deemed necessary to dispose of them. In my opinion the 6 killings left 4 people alive which represented the four different personalities of Malcolm but the strongest personality represented by Timmy killed the rest off leaving Malcolm hopelessly controlled by his rage and judgement of the traumas that afflicted him."

","Spoilers herein.<br/><br/>About half of all films today are of the type that directly tinker with the narrative in some way. Usually the game is intended to play with the role of the viewer, tricking him into being a cocreator of the story. Sometimes it is simpler, where the writer takes the viewer aside to have a conversation ABOUT the story while the story is underway.<br/><br/>That latter is what we are meant to think is going on at the start of this project. There's a 'Scream' -like stance, flavored with the time-hopping multiple threads from similarly-motivated Tarantino-inspired efforts. But then we shift into more of a challenge: this is a mystery, it seems. 'Ten Little Indians' is cited (though the original title would have had more edge) by one of the characters as we shift into a struggle with the writer over who creates the future. It is as if our relationship with the writer changed from comfortable confidant to adversary, a clever, clever writing trick.<br/><br/>But no, we do not stop there. We now have two dynamic situations, the action on screen and the newly insecure relationship with the writer. Another shift! This time we move into what I think is a genre that has only appeared only in the last couple years. That's where we see multiple actors, but they are all playing the same character. Happened first for me in 'Thing You Can Tell By Just Looking At Her,' there cloaked in a magical realism. Most recently it happened in '13 Conversations about One Thing.' In both cases the unified character was a woman.<br/><br/>Here it is a man, but the backbone of this film is Clea DuVall, though the apparent narrator is Cusack. Cusack already has made a specialty of these sorts of self-referential folding where he is the narrator but not really. DuVall was the central character in '13 Conversations,' and she plays precisely the same persona and narrative anchor here.<br/><br/>All this is important if you want to understand the trick at the end. Which character is the murderer? Nope, not the kid: Ginny. <br/><br/>Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 4: Worth watching."

","Each Friday night of my teenagehood years passed with watching Horror classics. When the mysterious killer reveals out to be a child of my age or even younger, that had always gotten me into an excitement. Watching ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" was a proof of mine, saying ""-Look, I'm totally grown up, now. I don't afraid of Freddy any more. Huh huh!"" , to mum.<br/><br/>Time's changed. Horror genre is strengthened by mindless mysteries and sentimentalism. This new type of horror can't make viewers laugh or have fun any more. If not getting any fun from a horror, why watching it? The plot is solely good for mystery; yet the director chose to make a horror/teen slasher, which happened to be a fallacious deduction. Directing and editing is totally awful. ""Identity"" is talented director James Mangold's worst movie. From 1995 to 2005, his first decade of industrial movie making experience had caught everybody's attention. The present time is 2009. His latest works ""Walk The Line"" and ""3:10 to Yuma"" scored success both on box-office and on film critics. I wish we won't see any disappointment from him any more.<br/><br/>Reminiscent of Agatha Christie's ""And There Were None""(1945), Hitchcock's Psycho and Kubrick's idea of mystery at Indian cemetery; there is no such thing as an original idea. The opening scene sparks off a traffic accident profits from each character's view of the accident. No one was guilty. Followed by coincidences 8 adult, 1 child and the runner of the motel got stuck in a deluge. The story telling was as good as 2004's best motion picture winner ""Crash"". Differently, they never tried to break free from their situation. Instead, they make each other fall into a calamity. After two more coincidences, we learned as a third coincidence that everyone shares the same birthday. 10 people, all of them, have born on the 10th of May. Then Amanda Peet tried to save the situation: ""This place used to be an Indian cemetery"".<br/><br/>Even before the first half of the movie, it happened to become a comedy by a chain of disasters and coincidences. Thanks to Alan Silvestri, who has composed a good music score. Watching for the reason to learn what's going to happen at the end, has been the key factor that made viewers think this is better than an average movie. Quite frankly, it is not. Film editing is dreadful.<br/><br/>1 out of 10 for editing. 8 out of 10 for acting. When you come to the end, you'll realize that it's not the movie you're watching any more. It's so easy that when a director puts all the different puzzles and mysteries altogether mixing them with some sentimentalism, and when at the end his leading actor says: <br/><br/>""Sorry, I am a paranoiac. I was only dreaming. Nothing really happened. Everything was just a dream."""

How many bad movies is this recently for him?<br/><br/>Pretentious critics will embrace this stylish ""exercise,"" but more intelligent and sophisticated film audiences will not be taken in by a movie that clearly had no idea what to do in the final act, other than to be different for the sake of being different.<br/><br/>Movies with great twists -- The Sting, The Usual Suspects, The Sixth Sense -- all had great screenplays that never cheated the audience and held up under scrutiny later.

What better time for a psycho killer to start picking them off one by one?<br/><br/>That's the basic plot of this TEN LITTLE INDIANS-style suspenser, with all of the expected plot twists and brief gory flashes of violence, and it actually begins surprisingly well. The production values/technical credits are top-notch and the cast is good.

"JamesHitchcock","5","12","21","23 January 2008"," Two good films spliced together to make a bad one
","The twist- a sudden, unexpected development- is a common plot device in the modern cinema, especially in thrillers. Unfortunately for scriptwriters, most of the classic twists have been so over-used that they no longer come as a surprise to the audience. It no longer seems original to reveal that, for example, the hero's girl or best friend is really in league with the villains, or that a police officer investigating a crime is in fact responsible for committing it, or that a character believed to be dead is still very much alive.<br/><br/>Of course, the fact that a particular twist is so hackneyed as to have become a cliché does not prevent film-makers from continuing to rely upon it- ""Reindeer Games"" and ""Along Came a Spider"" are two examples of modern thrillers likely to leave audiences with a ""seen it all before"" feeling. The challenge to the really inventive scriptwriter is now to come up with as novel or outlandish a twist as possible. ""Identity"" is a good example.<br/><br/>The setting of the film is an isolated Nevada motel. (Motels, in the cinema, have always seemed sinister places ever since Hitchcock's ""Psycho"", set in the neighbouring state of Arizona). A sudden and violent rainstorm brings together ten strangers; the motel manager, a spoilt, arrogant movie star and her chauffeur (who turns out to be an ex-policeman), another policeman and the convict he is escorting, a prostitute, and two married couples, one of them with a young son. The mother of this boy has been injured after being struck by the film star's limousine.<br/><br/>One by one the members of this group start to die violent deaths. One of them must be a killer; the question is ""Which one?"" The film seems to be a traditional thriller along the lines of Agatha Christie's ""And Then There Were None"", challenging the audience to work out who is the murderer. We can, for example, rule out Caroline the film star (first to die), or the convict (too obvious), or his police escort. (His violent, aggressive personality also makes him a too-obvious suspect, and in any case ""the policeman did it"" was a plot line famously used by Christie in another of her murder mysteries).<br/><br/>Intercut with the scenes set in the motel, however, are scenes set in a courtroom. The judge, prosecution and defence lawyers and a psychiatrist are discussing the case of a convicted murderer named Malcolm Rivers, who has been condemned to death. The psychiatrist claims to have new evidence about Rivers' mental state which could save his life. Rivers, however, is not one of the group at the motel, and cannot possibly be responsible for the killings there.<br/><br/>Then comes the twist, which shows what the connection is between the two seemingly unconnected plot lines. It is revealed that none of the events at the motel have ever taken place. The characters gathered there do not exist outside Rivers' mind. He suffers from multiple personality disorder, and each of the characters at the motel represents one of his many separate personalities. The supposed ""killings"" represent a struggle between these personalities for dominance. His psychiatrist believes that at the end only one of his personalities will survive- the personality responsible for the real-life murders committed by Rivers.<br/><br/>This is certainly an original twist. The trouble is that as soon as the truth is revealed it renders everything that has gone before essentially meaningless. It becomes difficult for us to care about the people in the motel, or to concern ourselves about which one of them is killing the others, once we realise that they are no more than the fantasies of a madman's sick mind. This is a pity, because the motel part of the film is actually quite well done- highly atmospheric with some good acting contributions, especially from John Cusack as Edward the chauffeur and Ray Liotta as the policeman escorting the convict.<br/><br/>""Identity"" contains within it two potentially good films, one a murder mystery, the other a courtroom drama about the battle to save a mentally ill killer from the death penalty on the grounds of insanity. Unfortunately, these two good films have been incongruously spliced together to produce a bad one. 5/10"

","I must go against the tide of opinion here. Those people rating this film highly have to be deranged. This film represents exactly the wrong way to write a movie and goes against everything I've ever read about screenplay structure and application. The filmmakers of ""Identity"" have broken a sacred bond with us, the audience. They have betrayed us.<br/><br/>*** SPOILERS!!! *** <br/><br/>One of the cardinal rules of (successful) screenplay writing is to make the audience care about the characters. In this, all the actors do a bang-up job. Some really good casting here and I can't fault any of the actors, who all deliver excellent performances (even Amanda Peet, appropriately screechy here) except maybe the guy playing Malcolm.<br/><br/>But, 3/4 of the way through the film, the rug is yanked out from under us, and the audience is stabbed in the back. Everything we have been watching is not real, not even within the fictional construct of the film's artificial universe. None of the characters exist, the hotel doesn't exist, nobody was really killed, even the rain is false. Nothing that happens has made any sense, or needed to make any sense, because we have been watching the mindscape of an unappealing psychotic serial killer, not real people that the director and actors have tricked us into caring about.<br/><br/>When we, as audience members, enter a film screening, we are making an informal agreement between ourselves and the filmmakers, that we will suspend our disbelief, and, in turn, the filmmakers are going to provide us characters we can empathize with (or hate, if they are the villains), and a responsibly constructed story line that follows certain storytelling conventions. Identity changes the rules in the middle of the game! It's like going to watch a football game, only to be told half way through, sorry, this wasn't really a football game, it was really a BALLET about a football game.<br/><br/>Yes, I know there were some clues as to what was really happening presented right at the outset. But the fact that everything we were watching at the hotel didn't really exist was certainly hidden from us for far too long, until the only option remaining was that the whole thing was a dream or hallucination of some kind. <br/><br/>This was not a clever puzzle, or an enchanting riddle for the audience to solve. <br/><br/>This was a cheat, flat out. Straight up.<br/><br/>And shame on you, Mr. Cooney, and Mr. Mangold, for cheating your audience. It's one thing to pull a magic trick on your audience through the subtle art of misdirection. It's another to con them out of the price of a movie ticket or DVD. The old Bait and Switch in action. There's a reason why magicians get paid highly to perform, but hucksters and con men are thrown in prison.<br/><br/>Honestly, I am shocked that so many people rated this film so highly. If you really did enjoy this film, try the grade-Z cheapie Monster-A-Go-Go from 1965 (it's available on DVD), and tell me how much you enjoyed the ending of that film, another ""mindblowing twist"" that clubs us over the head with the fact that we just wasted our time watching what is a non-movie. <br/><br/>If you people enjoy watching a movie that figuratively stabs you in the back, then I can't do anything to help you.

"LloydBayer","8","2","2","26 March 2013"," An unpredictable, shocking, thrilling, edge-of-your-seat twister.
","I am hard pressed to maintain a sterile review without giving away spoilers because IDENTITY is filled with surprises, twists and shocks that even veteran film critics did not see coming. Ten years after watching this film, I watched it again and believe me, I enjoyed this roller-coaster of a movie just like I did the first time. <br/><br/>Inspired by Agatha's Christie's ""And Then There Were None"", Michael Cooney's phenomenal story will have you strapped in your seat from the gruesome beginning all through to the gruesome end. The setup is a desolate motel in the Nevada desert where ten strangers will face their darkest and final hours, all before the night is over. Lashed by a violent thunderstorm, the motel comes alive when a man (John C. McGinley) rushes in seeking urgent medical attention for his wife (Leila Kenzie). By his side is their little boy Timothy (Bret Loehr). The family is helped by a limo driver (John Cusack) and a reluctant movie star (Rebecca DeMornay) he was driving before coming to their aid. A cop (Ray Liotta) transporting a chained prisoner (Jake Busey) also stops for the night. The downpour also sweeps in a newly married couple (William Lee Scott and Clea DuVall) and a Las Vegas prostitute (Amanda Peet). With the phone lines down and electricity on the blink, they prepare to wait out the storm. Elsewhere, convicted serial killer Malcolm Rivers (Pruitt Taylor Vince) is about to be executed when his psychiatrist Dr. Mallick (Alfred Molina) discovers a journal. Rivers' journal throws new light on his conviction and Mallick calls for an eleventh-hour hearing on preventing the execution. Meanwhile our guests at the motel are being killed in a peculiar pattern, one by one, by an unknown murderer. <br/><br/>As they turn on each other to unmask the killer, director James Mangold opens a huge can of perfectly blended suspense and mystery while leaving the viewer with some very unavoidable questions. Is it the prisoner? Is it the weird motel clerk? Is it a character lurking in the shadows? And the most baffling question of all – What is the connection between Malcolm Rivers' hearing and the on-going butchery in a motel set in an entirely different location? Believe it or not, these are questions Mangold and Cooney have cleverly crafted just to pull the rug under your feet. Even if you have been watching and listening carefully, there is only the slimmest possibility you will find the answers before the director starts to untangle the mystery. This revelation is set at the beginning of the third act, with 30 minutes or so remaining, but perfectly timed to have the viewer's thoughts racing back to the beginning. Of course, by this time you will have either figured it out or you will be defenseless for Mangold's final blow. This is also when the narrative shifts from a whodunit to pure psychological horror with an omnipresent trace of the supernatural. <br/><br/>Leading an all-star cast, Cusack does a sensational job and along with Peet (they would co-star again in the apocalyptic 2012) maintains the sheer momentum of this plot twister. Liotta, Busey and John Hawes (as the motel clerk) add to the mystery but as you will find, these are small but vital blips in the bigger picture. In all, everyone does their part and at times appear to be a bit comical with characters shouting and screaming in tandem with the rising tension. Even so, this is merely the calm before the storm while the director gives you a little time to take in what is happening. If you liked the way THE SIXTH SENSE or SESSION 9 came crashing down on you, IDENTITY will do the same but the surprises keep coming at you instead of just one major twist reserved for the end. I think I have said enough. Anymore and I might give into the temptation of revealing the film's darkest but well kept secrets."

","This is an imaginative mystery film. Set during a storm, 10 different characters take refuge in a motel in the middle of nowhere. One by one they become victims of a psychotic killer whose identity is not disclosed until the very end. Because it keeps the audience guessing it manages to keep up the suspense and utilizes the dark, stormy environment to achieve an exciting climax. Good performances are accomplished by John Cusack (""Ed""), Ray Liotta (""Rhodes"") and Amanda Peet (""Paris""). But I think the best acting was done by John Hawkes as the motel desk clerk, ""Larry"". And while it has no major faults, I would have preferred to see more of Rebecca De Mornay who played the self-centered actress named ""Caroline Suzanne"". But that's just my personal preference and it doesn't impair the movie to any real degree. In short, this is a very nice film that retains interest from start to finish. Highly recommended for those who enjoy a movie of this genre."

","If one were to scan the confines of films released in the 2000's decade, they might be surprised at the barrage of horror and thrillers that were either released to minimal viewing, or endured success in the theater never to be spoken about again. Identity falls into the second category, and sadly, I don't believe, enjoyed the acclaim it deserves. It is a crafty thriller, in a world where few exist. It succeeds in areas usually left untouched in other thrillers. And its third act doesn't leave off on a botched cliffhanger.<br/><br/>It is a dark and stormy night in Nevada. We see a family of three drive along an empty road before getting a flat. The man (McGinley) and the woman (Kenzle) get out of the car to attend to it and it isn't long before a limousine driver (Cusack) taxiing a brash and brazen actress (Mornay) strikes the woman, knocking her out and leaving her bleeding uncontrollably. While this is happening, the couples' kid (Loehr) witnesses it all.<br/><br/>The road is flooded both ways, so the gang winds up heading to a seamy motel, run by John Hawkes in a well nuanced performance. Throughout the night, numerous other people show up at the motel such as Ray Liotta, whose character is transporting a convict to another prison, a prostitute (Peet), and a newlywed couple (Duvall and Scott). They believe that their presence in the same motel on the same night is a coincidence, until more information is revealed.<br/><br/>All of this seems to be fine, until people start disappearing one by one. Experienced moviegoers may discover who it is before most. I was expecting Identity to have a great first act, an intriguing second act, but a phoned-in, cliché-ridden third act. On the contrary; every act in Identity is taken care of and the writing throughout the film is polished ecstatically.<br/><br/>The performances are not overacted, with probably the one of the hour coming from John Cusack; an actor who I've always been pleased with. He captures the role of the everyman extremely well, and always seems to play the character who is sophisticated and tries to keep everyone controlled and collective. I think between Identity and 1408, he always has had problems with motels.<br/><br/>Identity is a crafty, and well-done thriller, motivated by lively performances, slick writing, and a final act that wraps everything together nicely. It goes on the shelf not side-by-side cheap, inferior thrillers, but next to films like Jeepers Creepers and Joy Ride. I like to call this shelf ""underrated and unsung.""

"baumer","6","10","18","1 May 2003"," I wanted so much more, this can't be it.
","Very few times have I been more excited to see a film than I was to see Identity.  With the healthy revival of the horror genre in the last few years, film makers have been doing it right more times than I can remember since the early 80's.  I think The Ring has set the bar so high for so many films that now writers are trying to do the next great thing to scare the hell out of you.  And every film has a shocking twist to it now a days as well.  Think back to films like The Sixth Sense, The Usual Suspects, Fight Club and a few others and it seems that everyone is now trying to give us the next great twisted film.  Whatever works I guess.  The only danger of that mentality is that when you market a film like the way Identity was marketed, you better make sure that your twist pays off and doesn't make the audience feel cheated.  I read Roger Ebert's review of The Usual Suspects and one of the reasons why he didn't like the film all too well is because he felt that the twist was so truculent, so brash and so unexpected that he felt cheated.  There was no way that he could figure it out and he felt that the creators of the film didn't play fair with it's audience.  While I do not agree with that assessment of The Usual Suspects, I do understand what he was complaining about because that is how I felt here.  The twist is so unexpected, so convoluted and so unfair that when it did happen, I looked at my wife and said, ""What the hell...are you serious?""  And from that point on ( and there was still about 15 minutes left in the film), I just couldn't enjoy what I was watching.  I just couldn't buy into what they were asking me to accept.  Without giving away the film, a good comparison perhaps is to say that if you were told that your two best friends were in a fist fight and you had to stop them from hurting each other, but then found out that it was all spurious expose, would you really fear for their safety or would you watch with a crooked grin on your face?<br/><br/>Identity is a film that is blessed with a plethora of excellent horror film elements.  You have ten strangers that all seem to have some sort of connection.  It is a dark and stormy night and the small area in Nevada that they are in is going through a torrential storm.  It is flooding the roads so that everyone has to take refuge at a dingy looking Batesesque looking motel.  The film starts out beautifully with a terrible car accident that may have been triggered by one of the other patrons when she lost some of her luggage on the road which caused the flat tire and this caused the accident.  Everyone seems to be meeting by suspiciously conspicuous circumstances.  What they all have in common and why they are all here is the million dollar question.   <br/><br/>Soon everyone is settled into the rooms but other eerie events just keep popping up all over the place.  And then finally someone dies.  And in a most heinous of ways.  She has her head cut off and placed in a dryer. Pretty gruesome stuff.  But what is the significance of everyone being here and why can't they get out?  It is almost like they have been brought here by some mystical force and it is keeping them here.  Radios don't work, cars won't start, the storm is flooding everything except the motel and to make matters worse, there is a psychotic prisoner chained to the bathroom wall in one of the rooms.  Add to the story that they all share the same birthday, some strange names and the you now have one seriously confusing film.  And that is where the films stops being suspenceful and confusing and it heads into the absurd.<br/><br/>There are enough red herrings introduced in the film as well to throw you off of the real deal but some of those red herrings would have made a more compelling story than they one that the writer's want us to believe.  But what does keep the film flowing is the actors.  With a film blessed with a cast that includes Amanda Peet, Ray Liotta and John Cusack, there is never a dull moment.  Cusack carries the film and every second he is on screen he makes you listen.  He has come such a long way from his days in films like Sixteen Candles and The Sure Thing.  I have never seen him better than he is here.<br/><br/>But ultimately what transpires in the last half hour of the film is what put me off.  That is not to say that it will put a typical viewer off the film off, it probably won't.  I have talked to many people that saw the film and loved it.  They liked the twist, they liked the outcome and they liked how it all played out.  I can't really tell you why I didn't care for it, but I just didn't.  And this is coming from a guy that loved the twist in Fight Club, Sixth Sense and The Usual Suspects.  Go figure.  Maybe I didn't feel cheated in those films the way I felt cheated here.<br/><br/>6.5 out of 10<br/><br/>Maybe the best thing to do is just judge for yourself."

","movies these days have been going downhill fast. Identity was merely one of the first of many movies to signal such times. The movie pretends to take place in reality when in fact it takes place inside the head of a psycho and all the characters are personalities. There is one huge basic problem with this sort of story: personalities are personalities, not people. They do not interact with other personalities and figuratively or literally kill each other such as portrayed in the movie. The true interactivity comes from the outside and not the inside of the brain. The other problem is the truth of this story takes all of the so-called ""thrilling"" aspects out of the film and turns it into something sub-standard. Identity almost manages to make itself a B-movie, but little else."

","A group of seemingly random individuals are stranded at a motel one stormy night and they eventually come up dead one by one.

It is made more compelling because as you get a look inside the head of Malcom River (Pruitt Taylor Vince), he is at the same time in front of a panel that is to decide whether he should be given the death penalty for his crimes, or be put in an insane asylum. A good job is done to keep you guessing until the end, both on the eventual verdict and the eventual prevailing identity. This was a very good movie that flew under the radar."

","Once every while you watch a movie that you thouroughly enjoy, but still feel cheated afterwards. 'Identity' must be the ultimate movie in that category, as it's spooky, stylish, dark and scary, but ultimately very unsatisfying. <br/><br/>Ten people are being forced to stay in a motel for the night after a storm flooded all the highway exits. Soon, the character mysteriously die one at a time (think 10 little indians), and it's up to main character Ed (John Cusack) to figure out just what is happening.<br/><br/>It sounds like an exciting story, and it is. The actors (besides Cusack we see - amongst others - Ray Liotta and Amanda Peet) are fine, the atmosphere just right and the story entertaining as well as dark. But then, about 3/4 into the movie, the writers spoil it by completely explain the plot and what the heck is going on.<br/><br/>(SPOILERS BEGIN) It turns out Cusack really is one of 10 identities a serial killer has, and the others in the motel are the other 9. One of those 10 is a killer, while the others may not be as harmful. The real killer's lawyer wants to establish this so he can plead insanity, and the killer won't get the death penalty. The idea of the lawyer is to have Cusack kill of the murderer in his mind, so he won't be a danger anymore. There, got it?<br/><br/>It's all a bit silly, come to think of it, but the worst part is that it is all happening after 3/4 of the movie. So the last 20 minutes or so, when tension should rise, you're watching a movie about fictious people, to save the life of a known serial killer. That's not really helping the story, to put it mildly.<br/><br/>Enough has been said about the ending, it's just so stupid I won't waste any words on it. Identity could've been such a good movie, now it's just entertaining until that very moment everything is revealed...<br/><br/>5/10."

The motel is on the site of a old Indian burial ground, the best plot settings for a really good scary and edge of your seat movie. It does not fail till you find out it all taking place inside a social pathetic killers head, all the ""people"" are his split persona's forced to meet and fight for dominance. Roy Loita is the prime suspect as the person that is the killer, alas why he is the killer/criminal in the guys head, but it is wow the innocent little kid who faked his death to go unnoticed until he could kill off the rest and escape to kill in the real world.

And while we don't see Malick or Rivers again for a while, they are somehow connected with these events too. Exactly how I've never quite figured out.<br/><br/>The one common thread is that all the parties involved (except Malick) are driving through rural Nevada in heavy rain that is causing so much flooding everyone will end up at this one motel. A hooker who wants to grow oranges in Florida, the spoiled actress Carolina Suzanne and her driver Ed, the York family, newlyweds Ginny and Lou, and Rhodes, who is transporting prisoner Robert Maine.<br/><br/>Motel clerk Larry calmly checks everyone in, not exactly upset by all the chaos. But there's no working phone, and one of the potential guests seriously needs emergency help. Ed tries, but there's too much flooding to make it to a hospital and even cell phones don't work.<br/><br/>Ed, a former cop, tries to take charge of the situation, though Rhodes seems to think he should be in charge. And then people start dying. And the prisoner escapes. The newlyweds are in Room 6, and the number falls, making it look like a 9. The main clues to the murders are keys found with the bodies, and the keys seem to be showing up in sequence--10, 9, 8, 7 ...<br/><br/>So who will survive? Who is really behind the murders? And how are Malick and Rivers connected to all this? <br/><br/>I found the early scenes fascinating. Everyone was connected to everyone else, and if one event hadn't happened, none of the others would have. Eventually, I was just plain confused because I didn't know what was going on.<br/><br/>And when the murderer was finally revealed, he or she was not really revealed. I felt like I had heard three different possibilities but not been told which one was the right one. Then again, maybe I was told more information than was needed, and some of it was irrelevant. But I can't believe they would go THIS far ...<br/><br/>There were a lot of good acting performances. I genuinely dislike John McGinley, but he played a totally different character here than what I am used to. He seemed compulsive and somewhat mentally ill but genuinely desired to do the right thing.<br/><br/>Gary Busey was scary and almost funny, not too different from some of his other bad guy characters.<br/><br/>Bret Loehr didn't have much to do early as the little boy who had lost one parent and seemed likely to lose two more. But he was quite good later.<br/><br/>John Cusack carried the movie. He showed frustration but also competence. His character wasn't perfect but he wanted to do the best he could and didn't have patience with those who didn't care about others or couldn't handle the situation.<br/><br/>And Rebecca DeMornay did the demanding celebrity routine quite well.<br/><br/>I'm not going to recommend this for family viewing because some of the bodies are hard to look at.<br/><br/>It's mostly a worthy effort."

This is a notch below those perfections, but still makes an extremely intelligent and engrossing watch. John Cusack is one of my favourite actors and he is extremely talented.

Their relief in finding shelter is quickly replaced with fear as the ten travelers begin to die, one by one. They soon realize that, if they are to survive, they'll have to uncover the secret that has brought them all together. Parallel to this story, there is also the hearing of a murderer who has already been sentenced to death.<br/><br/>What if every choice we make was already made for us? What if there really were no coincidences in life & our destinies were already predetermined? I will not give anything away and spoil this for you. The film is only 80 minutes and I thought it was too short. The director, James Mangold could have extended the runtime more. I know it is petty reason when the movie is already as brilliant as it is, but that would have satisfied me more. Nobody in this film look like stars acting in a movie. All of them fit into their character perfectly. The standout comes from Ray Liotta and John Cusack.<br/><br/>****Spoiler Alert**** Though I figured out the killer in the beginning, the plot made it impossible for that character to be the killer. So, I thought it must be Amanda Peet or Ray Liotta's character. But, that turned out to be a dud and the director made my first guess the killer. Anyway, its an awesome film.

A fantastic cast helps this film along with John Cusack being as watchable as ever, and Amanda Peet making a particularly good job of things.

And thanks to James Mangold's confident direction and some superb acting, Identity emerges as a gripping, engaging and surprisingly thought-provoking horror film.<br/><br/>I don't want to give too much away about the plot because the greatest joy to be had is watching the mysteries unfold. All of the characters at the motel are entertaining in their own way. Special mention should go to John Cusack and Ray Liotta. One who is a cop. And one who isn't. The film itself will explain what that statement means, and its all handled with a surprising deftness.<br/><br/>I love the interconnecting events concerning how each one of the guests end up at the motel. The situations sometimes flow into each other, such as John Cusack's character encountering a family stranded on the highway who all end up going to the same motel.<br/><br/>Rebecca DeMornay puts in a scene-stealing appearance as a faded film starlet. And what really shocked me was that I didn't even know it was her until the credits rolled. Amazing how a famous face can go right past you.<br/><br/>Not all of the characters are famous, but they do a good enough job of fleshing out their identities, and they become something more than just stock filler material until their time in the spotlight is up. They all come complete with their own pasts and separate agendas.<br/><br/>I was glad to see Clea DuVall in the cast, a very underrated actress. But unfortunately, she isn't given much of a chance to shine like she has in some of her other film roles, like The Faculty. In that film, she was able to transcend what could easily have been a very clichéd character. But in Identity, she isn't given much to do beyond crying a lot, and the way she's written out was disappointing. Especially for an actress of her considerable talents.<br/><br/>Amanda Peet brings some much needed depth to the role of a prostitute. In some ways she is the most rounded character out of the lot. Especially because she gets to fulfil a life-long dream during the course of the film.<br/><br/>And John Cusack and Ray Liotta provide a fascinating counterpoint. Cusack serves as a logical anchor, and Liotta is a tightly wound hothead with a few secrets of his own. Watching the sparks fly from these two is worth the price of admission alone. And look out for Jake Busey as the customary eye-rolling psycho added into the mix.<br/><br/>One thing that was refreshing about Identity is the way its sharp and involving in this postmodern era of horror movies without having to resort to Screamesque in-jokes and genre nods. The taut direction and sheer talent of its stars is enough to carry the film forward. The film occasionally dabbles in areas such as destiny and fate that feels like its wandered in from Final Destination. That only serves as a distraction. Identity is at its best when functioning as an engaging horror shocker, before it pulls the rug out from under us.<br/><br/>The thing that people pick up on about Identity is the shocking plot twist that surfaces three quarters of the way through. And what a plot twist it is too! A twist that involves the scenes with Alfred Molina converging with the events at the motel. And it does it in a very satisfying way that lends the film a conceptual sophistication like something out of a Charlie Kaufman film. And there are more plot twists to come.<br/><br/>I can't say anything more about them otherwise it would rob the climax of its immeasurable power. It could be regarded as a directors cop-out, but not when you deconstruct the rest of the film beforehand. I for one loved Identity, and its ingenious multilayered approach. It left me pondering the notions of identity and reality for days afterwards.<br/><br/>Watch Identity, and you'll see what I mean."

","I tried to watch this movie without any expectations, and it has two good actors in it, so I figured it might lead to something original. hmmm. It has an interesting enough concept, and midway through it really showed some promise after a certain something was revealed. However, anything in the film is soon tarnished by a laughably predictable Hollywood ending that most might not see coming because they won't think they'd even take it that far. I joked about how the movie would end while watching it, but was surprised I was right when it came. Should have known better. The plot twist itself, prior to the ending, could have made a decent movie and I'm sure the director thought he was making an intelligent film. But the way I see it, the twist makes it all too convenient for the plot holes and inconsistencies to exist without explanation anywhere in the story. <br/><br/>Ray Liotta and John Cusack pull off some good performances, but no acting performance could make up for the story. For example, put Keanu Reeves in the Matrix and it still sucks. Wait, he's not an actor. Liotta should stick to crime drama and Cusack should stick with those quirky movies we all love to see him in. <br/><br/>I can see why some people may be fooled into believing this is a good movie. A good movie is one that can be watched time and time again. ANY movie can keep you interested until the end, but that doesn't necessarily make it good. All you've got to do is confuse the audience all to hell so that there's no way they can tell what's going on until the end......but in this case, it kept me interested with many intentional distractions only to be let down. The movie lost several points just for the cop out ending alone.<br/><br/>I am genuinely fascinated by this film's favorable rating. I'm feeling generous today. 5/10"

","*POTENTIAL SPOILERS*<br/><br/>Good horror movies work best when you care about the characters. Thanks to a trite plot twist about half way through, I ended up not giving a hoot about the so-called ""characters"" trapped at the hotel in the rain with a killer in this well-made but ultimately bogus slasher/mystery flick. ""Identity"" starts off as a mildly entertaining combination of an Agatha Christie mystery and a good old ""who's getting axed next"" horror romp. But then it tries to be clever with the most over-used of plot twists (all I will say is MPD) and alienates the audience in the process. The cast is very good, especially Cusack, Liotta, and Amanda Peet (an interesting actress who really needs a new agent and more confidence, as I predict she could blow us away in the right role but who has been regulated to the worst comedies or recent memory), but they all could do better than this slick thriller that is more dumb than clever. I was almost ready to forgive the film and pass it off as a moderately enjoyable flick, until one final plot twist at the end irked me to the point that I hated it. The ending is ludicrous and is even more painful to sit through thanks to some of the worst special effects of recent memory (which was surprising considering the decent production values up until that point). Oh well...rent something else."

","Identity is a shaggy dog movie. You have seen a few other movies of this kind. The writer and the director convince themselves that their twist is so very clever, conceptually mind-bending and original that the viewer will be bowled over by the big revelation. The most extreme and offensive form this can take -it is not the form taken in this movie- is the discovery that ""it was all a dream."" That is, what you were looking at for 1.5 hours never happened. Cheap and disgraceful. Identity has a tad more integrity than that, but not much more. You eventually learn that, as the New York Times reviewer put it, ""the movie you were seeing is not the movie you were seeing."" You are set up with what appears to be a complexly plotted thriller/whodunit/horror movie. There are a number of sharply defined characters; each has a special story to tell; it turns out that they are all related in some way. They get killed off one by one - most of them anyway. You are drawn in by the way the film is shot and cut. It's very professional, and the thing moves along very nicely - no fat, no wasted footage. You look forward to a satisfying resolution, something along the lines of the original Ten Little Indians, which is referenced by one of the characters. <br/><br/>Your expectations will be in vain. None of the relationships and plot developments are relevant to what you have been led to expect. The twist is a tribute to the writer-director's laziness. The movie isn't the one you thought you were watching. It wasn't all a dream, but it might as well have been. Junk on stilts. - If you must watch this movie, do not watch the trailer, which contains a major spoiler."

"nycritic","8","4","7","4 February 2006"," Smart B-Movie Thriller
","As the norm, B-movies have a certain freedom to show on-screen what big-name productions shy away from, and thanks to this, they can retain a near 100 percent truthfulness to what they're trying to tell. IDENTITY, an effective little movie that became the sleeper hit of the first third of 2003 is one of those clever stories. Taking a cue from Agatha Christie's ""Ten Little Indians"", one of the few of her stories which have failed to make an impression on the big screen, director James Mangold and screenwriter Michael Cooney bring forth this apparently predictable but surprising slasher-thriller about ten strangers, neither of them related to each other, who during a heavy storm converge in an out-of-the-way motel in the middle of nowhere. That it becomes evident that there is more to every one of these people than first value would suggest is just the icing on the cake. When they start getting picked off one by one, paranoia sets in and the remaining survivors try to uncover the killer's identity.<br/><br/>Waving in an out of this suspenseful story is the tense battle between a psychologist trying to save his patient from certain death. It becomes known to us that he's a mass murderer, and a former cop, but to talk more about this would be 'murder' to anyone who hasn't seen this clever story. More so because there is a crucial plot point which ties both the events in the motel and the inquisition. As a matter of fact, much of IDENTITY occurs in a deceptive non-linear way. The manner as to how the main players are introduced, with the actions of one affecting the course of action of the other, going back and forth before getting into the meat of the plot, is downright tight.<br/><br/>Mangold is one of the newer directors whom I'm getting acquainted with and in the process, enjoying his work. His rendition to the slasher genre is hard to classify at times because a lot of the movie is an intense character piece where every one of his players are people instead of plot-types (while initially appearing so). Having a large roster of big names and lesser-known names helps, too, because it misdirects the viewer into believing that an actor known for playing a certain type of role will repeat a performance here, but Mangold is looking for something else aside from entertaining. It seems to me that his intentions are to twist a well-known genre and take it to an unexpected ground without cheating his audience a la M. Night Shyamalan. And because all the little giveaways are there, cleverly hidden in their plain exposure, no one can say he cheated for shock value. I loved IDENTITY, with its dark colors and late-night horror movie values, and can't say there wasn't a moment when an actor didn't nail his or her presence."

I was pleasantly surprised to find the greater depth and plot twists involved. Actually, even as a whodunnit, forgetting the real plot for a moment, it works pretty well.<br/><br/>There are more red-herrings in this movie than the North Sea fishing fleet has, so be warned that whatever you think is going on, probably isn't.<br/><br/>All of the characters have decent roles.

","Identity has the wild unpredictability of the essential horror film, set at a timeworn motel in the middle of nowhere. The only guests have only stopped there because of the same freak accident. Alas, it falls through every cliché trapdoor on the blueprint, entirely preventable ones, too, ones that won't open unless you consciously open them, and its wild unpredictability is relegated to merely an offshoot of its absurdity. We still have fun, and, yes, it is still eerie sometimes, but it too much wants to be our friend. It has a star-studded cast of actors we love, the way it gets to its mindblow twist is through a ridiculous and completely avoidable contrivance in dialogue and moreover, the score is too often superfluous, signaling what we are supposed to feel, and as a consequence we don't have to feel it if we don't want to. The film would have been much more effective, far-fetched points and all, if the tension were allowed to grow genuinely rather than be explained by the underscoring.<br/><br/>It has been too long since we've seen the unbelievably sexy Rebecca DeMornay in a mainstream film. Had her performance in The Hand That Rocks the Cradle not been a wake- up call for filmmakers, the very kind that like to makes movies like this? Ray Liotta can by now play this kind of role in his sleep. Alfred Molina is hardly a part of the action and does not get to have the kind of fun as he does with so many other roles, but that is no matter for us simply to joy in seeing him. There is also the character actor John C. McGinley in a high- strung dramatic role, having never before been boring anyway. So this seemingly ambitious psychological thriller has star power which results in our immediate enjoyment instead of our deep involvement.<br/><br/>Yes, we are truly wondering how this and that could possibly happen, or who could possibly be responsible, and if so, how? Its script is one step away from being ludicrous with cheap pseudo-impressive buy-offs, but depending on the audience, one could either take the bait and be wowed or laugh out loud at its final unraveling, which is what I did. Basically, you can see that the certitude lies in the hands of a skillful enough director, and, with a world of better direction than James Mangold's, this could have been a lot better."

It's the ending. Difficult to explain what goes wrong here without revealing it, so I'll write in generalities. By the end of the film, when the pieces at last begin to fit together, we come to feel some compassion for the characters that we know are essentially decent and we learn to wish the best for them. The ending betrays that, and is thus annoying and disappointing. Whatever first went wrong with the killer here happens yet again. Life's just a joke, after all, and a rather cruel one.<br/><br/>This is not only unfair to the characters, but to the audience as well. a less violent ending would not have betrayed the heart of the film, but would instead have reached the depth the film pretends to seek.<br/><br/>Definitely worth the trip, but might be more satisfying if you just skip the last five minutes."

Like those, it boasts an impeccable direction and cast, a very enjoyable, if borderline formulaic, first part, and a deeply satisfying and most memorable ""cherry on the cake"" in the form of said final twist.

","I found this movie to be horrible. At the start, I was almost drawn in but was distressed by the continuity and plot inconsistencies many will notice. Also, the unlikely behavior of the characters made it difficult to grant license and lose myself in the movie. These inconsistencies are explained through a plot device that I have always found unappealing, (if you see the movie you know what the mechanism is) the use of this device and especially the fact that it is revealed halfway through the movie greatly devalues viewer's interest in the outcome, which I found to be thoroughly predictable. Conversely, if the finish hadn't been mostly revealed at that time the continuity errors may have made give up before the end, in short it just doesn't work. The psychological aspect and psychologist scenes are shallow and implausible. I actually think this setting would have worked better as a straight slasher. I also found the lack of gore disappointing. Characters die off in a blink of an eye, the audience has little chance to be fearful for them or develop tension, and only two scenes had any element of suspense at all for me. Once the mystery unravels our empathy for the characters is unraveled as well, and by the last 30 minutes of the film you're just waiting for the credits."

","PROS: This movie was such an amazing find. To start off, the way the characters interacted was unbelievably thought out and intricate. There wasn't a single actor that didn't do or say something without a purpose. The way everything was strung together, from character interaction to plot lines, was completely flawless. You were never bored and you were never directly given any answer. What I really like is when you are forced to think with the characters, not for them. It allows the watcher to become invested in the film. Not only was I invested for some of the film, but I was captivated by the whole film from beginning to end. There wasn't a single scene that dragged or didn't have a purpose. This includes the resolution which, if I might add, was the best ending to any movie I've seen in the past month. The last thing that I'll add was how spectacular the actors were. I loved the cast and the raw emotion that they showed. With such a large cast it's hard to find a good actor for each role, but IDENTITY did that.<br/><br/>CONS: This con might not seem like a big deal, but it is very important to me. The trailer was very poorly put together. I pick which movies I watch based on trailers, and I almost didn't pick this one because of its poor editing and plot description.

"brando647","8","2","3","30 October 2012"," Cool Twist on a Familiar Thriller Theme
","IDENTITY takes a concept that we've seen countless times before and puts an interesting new spin on it. It's got its problems, but sports a mostly solid cast and a cool enough twist to make it stand out as a fun thriller. It starts as your usual ""Ten Little Indians"" style thriller, with a group of seemingly random people brought together in an isolated location before they begin dying off one by one under mysterious circumstances, but IDENTITY has a unique twist (that I will try to avoid ruining here in case you haven't seen the movie). The events are set in a desolate Nevada motel in the middle of the desert where a rainstorm has stranded 10 strangers for the night: Ed (Cusack) is a limousine driver transporting a washed up actress with an attitude, Paris (Peet) is a prostitute on her way to Florida in an effort to start a new life, Rhodes (Liotta) is a police officer moving a serial murderer between prisons, Ginny (Duvall) and Lou (Scott) are miserable newlyweds, and the York family is searching for help when the mother is run down by Ed's limo in a horrific accident. The storm has flooded all roads out of the area and soon visitors are killed in bizarre ways and paranoia settles in when they realize the killer could be any one of them. Meanwhile, in a seemingly unrelated story, a man convicted of multiple homicides is given one last opportunity to plead his case with a judge in hopes of staving off a death sentence.<br/><br/>It's tough to mention any parts of the film that either worked or failed without wandering into spoiler territory so I'll try to keep it vague story-wise. For the most part, it's a cool movie. I love movies set in a single isolated location (in this case the motel) because the location becomes it's own character. Here is a creepy, worn-out motel with it's buzzing neon sign in the middle of an empty highway, run by a scrawny, strung-out out man who has his own secrets. The rain is a constant presence, adding to the horror movie vibe. Without the ability to jump between locations, a movie like this is forced to turn to its characters for the story, so the movie really rides of the cast and their performances to carry its weight. Director James Mangold and cinematographer Phedon Papamicheal do an awesome job of giving the movie it's foreboding atmosphere and the cast make an otherwise ""been there, done that"" story feel fresh. John Cusack is an awesome character actor and you can pretty much count on him to keep it interesting, and Ray Liotta has pretty much made a career out of playing cops/criminals so his turn here as the short-tempered Rhodes isn't a stretch for him. There are a few other good performances out of the supporting crew (mostly Amanda Peet and John Hawkes, as the shifty motel owner), but the rest border on annoying and over-the-top. Then again, John C. McGinley is almost always over-the-top, so I guess he can be forgiven here.<br/><br/>The main draw of IDENTITY is, of course, the big reveal at the end of the second act that ties everything together and explains the logic behind it all. In theory, it was a cool twist and it adds a lot to the movie. It's something we hadn't seen done before and I can appreciate any movie that gets creative with old ideas. The problem was in the execution. I can forgive any other aggravation or annoyances with the movie, but the final reveal is just too laughable. So, in a way, the movie is really cool up until the final five minutes. The end just spoils it. Anyone who has seen it would probably agree. I can almost see why it was written that way, and it sort of makes sense. But that doesn't make it any less amusing and, since this isn't meant to be a comedy, sort of ruins the vibe. IDENTITY is a cool movie despite its flaws. I hate to say it's forgettable but it's just one of those movies that sank into the background soon after its release. I'd forgotten about it until I saw it sitting on my shelf collecting dust and gave it another viewing to see if it held up. And it does, pretty well. It won't wow anyone and it might make you chuckle at the end, but IDENTITY is pretty good overall."

Identity was one thriller that managed to surprise me greatly, as it turned out to be a brilliant psychological slasher with a powerful cast, obviously borrowed heavily from ""And Then There Were None"", well I say the plot, but other than that this movie well and truly stands on its own. It may not be gory which is what doesn't make this movie a straight up slasher, but it is violent and brutal keeping it more towards the horror aspect. Another factor is what I liked is that I well and truly wanted to know why these people were getting murdered and they're separate story lines also kept me interested and this movie is full of surprises and even adds a mind screwing twist that for any first time viewer will never figure out, making it well and truly amazing and original. I mean the twist was just genius and a well and truly talking point.<br/><br/>There is nothing bad I can say about this movie, the whodunit element was also done well and even had me shocked and surprised, The use of room keys as corpse markers is a great lead up for suspense. It's always edge-of-your-seat drama as red herrings are picked off, and the collection of people start to learn things about each other that make them all connected in some way, all of which makes the directing by James Mangold slick from beginning to end, with an effective and cleaver set up.<br/><br/>Off all the slasher movies I have seen, very few have gathered such a diverse and memorable cast as this. First we get former cop now limo driver John Cusack (Ed) giving a real intense performance as one the male leads, as the movie progresses he becomes more and more interesting and captivating. Ray Liotta (Rhodes) plays it cool as the cop but at the same time quite charming and creepy at the same time, he nailed the part and stealing the show in almost every scene, his chemistry with John Cusack was a real highlight. Amanda Peet (Paris) played the hooker and tart with a heart really well as the unlikely but obvious final girl. Clea Duvall proved competent in role as one half of the young married couple, although I did find her constant whining pretty annoying at times. Rebecca De Mornay gives a stand out performance as the faded actress and early victim, she should have been given more screen time. John C McGingley gave a credible and strong performance as the socially awkward family man George. Jake Busey played the psychotic prisoner and obvious red herring really well and John Hawkes played the motel manager Larry brilliantly and hits all the right notes.<br/><br/>All in all ""Identity"" is an effective horror through and through with a brilliant and perfectly played cast, an awesome story line and effective who done it plot which will keep you guessing until the end and a mind boggling twist that will blow your mind completely out of the water."

This is why the device of cutting back to the hearing with Malcolm Rivers (Pruitt Taylor Vince) nd his psychiatrist (Alfred Molina) every so often annoyed me.<br/><br/>Aside from it taking away (even if it was towards the end) from my utter surprise (though not completely), I really wanted to stay at that motel, with those people, until the ending. It was so engaging, right from the beginning, and escalated so rapidly and compellingly, I felt that each time we were whisked away to the shrink's or lawyer's offices, I was missing something. Sure, that's the genius of this plot, that I was wrong, but it still bugged me.<br/><br/>I hate having anything about a mystery given away. I want to be just as much in the dark, trying to figure out what the hell is happening, as are the characters. I like being surprised, caught off guard and fooled (by movies anyway). It is so hard to do it well and so seldom that a mystery is as artful as this, that any diversion is unwelcome.<br/><br/>While some complain that the ending is too upsetting or unsatisfying, I was properly stunned and though I thought I was fairly sure what would happen,I was wrong. THAT is a cool ending. As Mort Rainey (Johnny Depp)...or was it John Shooter (John Turturro)?...says in ""The Secret Window"" (Stephen King), ""The most important part of the story is the ending."" ""Identity"" lives up to that admirably.<br/><br/>Enough has been written about the excellent cast, but I would like to add that it was a great pleasure seeing John Cusack and Ray Liotta, two greats, both incredibly cool in different ways, play off one another, jockeying for ""alpha male"" position! You expect that from Liotta; not Cusack. The entire cast, however, was excellent. Amanda Peet, especially, was very sympathetic, so much so that you expect her to turn out to be nothing like she seems, in this labyrinth of fake identities and made-up life stories.<br/><br/>I was disappointed and surprised that Rebecca DeMornay (was ""that actress"" an allusion to ""Gilligan's Island""? Was the whole motel? lol) was used so briefly. She was a real villain in ""The Hand That Rocks the Cradle""! The geographical ""name-game"" was another nice twist, used by many directors and writers (remember the G.I.'s in ""Forrest Gump"", none of whom were named after their actual places of origins?).<br/><br/>This film, despite a few (minor) weaknesses, was excellent, edge-of-your-seat, great story-telling! I've lost count of how many times I've seen it, but, as with the film ""Blade Runner"" (referenced by many here), I notice something new each time. And it totally ""out-Psycho's"" ""Psycho"", which is quite a feat."

","There's hokum and there's hokum, which is to say there's bad hokum and good hokum. Identity, directed by James Mangold and written by Michael Cooney, is top-class, 24-carat, Grade A+++ hokum, the real McCoy. And that is meant as outright praise. From the intriguing opening shots to the final scene which, in a sense, wraps it all up, Identity scores big time. Other IMDb reviewers have criticised the film for its cod - and thus very wrong - psychology as regards the psychopathology of multiple personality disorder sufferers (or whatever the correct clinical name is). The only response to that is: who cares? If films always tried to get the psychology right, there would be far fewer films. Who cares? is my response to the occasional plot hole, but I shan't even bother listing them here, as the exercise would be pointless. Nor will I outline in tedious detail what happens, as to my tastes is too often the practice here. If you feel you need to know that before watching Identity, then please look elsewhere. I will simply say that Mangold's film is a very clever and very entertaining mix of thriller, suspense, horror and whodunit, with even the occasional dark joke. For this reviewer John Cusack and Ray Liotta are always a joy to watch, but the rest of the cast, not least Amanda Peet, complement their fine performances well. Fundamentally, the success of Identity is rooted in a clever, well-plotted and, in its way, rather original story by Cooney. But that story, made into a film, might well have died on its feet in lesser hands than those of Mangold. And even then it might not have been so hugely entertaining were it not for the cast, each of whom is, to some extent, a stereotype (what stage, novel or film character isn't?), but each of which is brought superbly to life and given a distinct identity by the actor who portrays him or her. I bought the DVD of Identity after watching Mangold's remake of 3.10 To Yuma which I enjoyed a lot. I have also bought, but not yet watched Cop Land, which, however, garnered less critical praise. But Mangold (who works with his producer wife Cathy Konrad) is a director to watch. But at the end of the day Identity's success is rooted in the screenplay by Cooney. If you like being entertained, held in suspense, if you like horror and intelligent whodunits, Identity is the film for you."

","Identity has all the elements of a good who done it thriller but looses a few brownie points for it's twist ending. And that sucks because this film needed no twist ending. The story was going really good as it was.<br/><br/>During a terrible rain storm several people are derailed from being where they need to be and end up at an motel. You have a hooker, an hotel clerk, an actress, an limo driver, an married couple with a young boy, a young married couple, and an police officer who is trying to relocate an prisoner. They soon realize that they are being killed off one by one. But then this movie makes a turn and you begin to think it could be something else which makes the film even more creepy and intense.

"bzb2001","6","2","3","5 January 2005"," A clichéd but fun classic whodunit
","James Mangold's 'Identity' is a film so wrapped up in tricking you it bypasses its story in the process. The picture tells two stories breaking between throughout. The primary tale is one of murderous chance. During a torrential rainstorm several people find themselves caught at a motel unable to go in either direction on the highway because of floods. All of a sudden people begin dying gruesome deaths.<br/><br/>The secondary plot has a convicted killer's lawyer meeting with a judge and prosecutors to determine a new fate for his clearly mentally ill client. This story is smaller and less engaging as the one set at the motel. However, with both stories you feel you are on a ride that will end with a twist. So sure are you that when the twists come, they are surprising but not as thrilling since you spent over an hour knowing it was coming.<br/><br/>In the end I decided the good outweighed the bad ... slightly. Most of 'Identity' has an old fashioned whodunit aspect that you can't help but love. The ending is iffy and although the story hooks you, there are so many clichéd plot points that your head shaking and eye-rolling stands in the way of enjoying an all together decent film.<br/><br/>I have found myself watching the meat of it several times, addicted by the intrigue even though I know what is to happen. There is fine acting by John Cusack, Amanda Peet, John C. McGinley, and others. The direction is also quite skillful and leaves you right on the edge of your seat when need be. There are many who will love this film for its cleverness. Others will find that it is too cunning for its own good. **.5 out of ****"

It's mainly up to John Cusack's chauffeur to sort things out and try and save the day.<br/><br/>The first part of the film is told in a series of flashbacks, showing how each of the ten arrives at the motel. This part is quite interesting, but by the time everyone arrives and the stage is set, the film slows down to a standard murder mystery, however the characters are engaging enough due to good performances, with John Cusack and Ray Liotta as the main star power, to hold you attention and keep you intrigued. <br/><br/>The film gradually gets more bizarre as it becomes seemingly impossible for the characters to escape. When they run off in one direction, they always end up back at the motel. The strangeness is no bad thing at this point, until the films goes completely over the top with the ridiculous ending. I won't say what it is, and you probably won't see it coming, but it left me disappointed and with a feeling that it was a waste of time rooting for any of the characters. <br/><br/>However, up to the last 20 minutes or so, this was a great tense thriller, excellent for one or two viewings. But because of the ending I can't really give it more than a 7 / 10."

John Cusack is good in everything he does. He still has that baby face, but as our main character, Ed, does the job at convincing us he is more then what we thought he was. Ray Liotta plays a cop, Rhodes, that seems to be the opposite of Ed. Where as Ed is cool and seems to have control, Rhodes is a loaded shotgun, angry and disorganized.<br/><br/> Identity manages to grab you rather well in the beginning. It does a good try at attempting the Twilight Zone effect, and perhaps would have made a great 1 hour episode. But in the VERY beginning, there is a scene which almost ruined the movie for me. I won't tell you what it is, but if you pay close enough attention to it, and a few other elements, you'll figure out most of the movie long before it's over. I did. I caught every little thing the movie threw out, and although the pieces didn't make complete sense, by the time it got to the 'twist', I was underwhelmed. <br/><br/>Identity has 2 twists. The last and final twist isn't as surprising as the first (and the first one was easy to figure out, remember? Of course you do, because you were paying attention.) Were it not for the predictability, this would have been a better flick. Perhaps you can enjoy the movie a little better if you don't analyze everything like I did.<br/><br/>Still, if you like suspense movies, rent it.

You are never really sure who the killer is in the movie, and when you find out in the end, it is a real shock. Also, this is the only movie I can think of that includes a red herring.

"w00f","6","2","3","27 April 2003"," Psycho meets The Sixth Sense: I Don't See Dead People
","""Identity"" has some solid performances by several fine actors, not the least of which are John Cusack and Ray Liotta.  The story and the plot have terrific potential.  It could have been a great movie, despite being a somewhat shameless rip-off of a short film made a couple of years ago that manages to tell the exact same story in about 20 minutes (sorry, I don't recall the name of the low-budget, black and white short that appeared as filler between features on the Sundance Channel).<br/><br/>Unfortunately, this movie blows it BIG TIME at the end.  I don't want to give it all away, but this is one of those movies that would have been an excellent psychological thriller if the writer and/or director hadn't decided that it needed a big surprise ending.  They achieve this ending by suddenly splicing in a bunch of extra scenes at the very end that turn all of the build-up in the rest of the movie into nothing more than a bunch of red herrings.  The ending chosen opens up a bunch of huge holes in the story that can only be explained away by a variant of the old ""it was all just a dream"" cop-out ending.  Personally, I hate it when a film makes such a transition in a glaring, rough way that almost takes the viewer by the back of the neck, shakes him violently and screams in his face, ""No, look stupid, we fooled you!  Now look at all the things we didn't let you see during the rest of the film!  Thanks for your $8.00, schmuck.""  I suppose the film makers HAD to do this, though, since the movie's twist is otherwise given away halfway through the film, at which point the balance of the movie is utterly predictable to anyone who hasn't been watching it with a burlap sap tied over their head.  Clearly, desperate moves were called for in order to achieve a blockbuster ending. Did I say blockbuster?  Change that to ""lackluster.""<br/><br/>This film could have raised a very interesting and original question about the nature of personality (and identity -- get it?), but instead, it lets itself be turned into ""Psycho"" meets ""The Sixth Sense.""  Instead of ""I see dead people,"" it turns into ""I don't see dead people.""<br/><br/>Big deal.  It could've been a good one.  Now it's poop.<br/><br/>If it weren't for the strong performances by Cusack and Liotta, I would've given this one a 5/10.  I'll give it an extra point for those guys, though."

"harry_tk_yung","Null","1","1","30 May 2017"," A (relatively) old gem
","Spoilers warning: for a 14-year-old movie <br/><br/>Stumbling across this DVD recently, I looked up some reviews by both critics and users. A bit surprising that they are unanimously favourable.<br/><br/>The fiendishly tantalising thing in these critic reviews is the references to the clever twist. They generally tell you that it is so clever that you cannot possibly see it coming. Then, one or two of them drop torturous hints that well, maybe, just maybe you can get something from this or that particular scene. If you don't think you have truly experienced frustration, try reading some of these critic reviews on ""Identity"".<br/><br/>The main story, for those who know (from book or screen) Agatha Christie's popular mystery about ten people stranded in an isolated location being killed off one after another (title changed so many times, for political correctness, that I won't bother), look familiar. But look is deceiving.<br/><br/>The ""parallel"" story, intersecting the main story with much shorter scenes, starts with an exasperated judge being called in late hours to hear the defence's final plead for a serial murderer going to execution in 24 hours. The psychiatrist's defence is multiple-personality, which might be novel for the 2003 movie, has been exploited to the fullest in the recent ""Split"" (2016).<br/><br/>While the key plot twist was considered really clever back in 2003, it is less so for today's seasoned audience. It does not take a lot to put two and two together: the murder mystery is something in the serial killer's mind. With this one clean broad stroke, anything and everything that looks implausible is neatly exonerated. Not Agatha Christie after all - no ingenious plot. <br/><br/>But there is one small FINAL twist that is quite clever. In the murder mystery (in the serial killer's head, remember), the sole survivor finds peace and quiet in the life she seeks. But a loose end has been hanging – two of the earlier victims met their death heading towards a car that exploded, presumably killing them. But absolutely nothing remained of these two, not even a small piece of charred substance. This was glossed over in the scene. But when one of those two (a pre-teen boy) turns up to kill the ""sole survivor"", the audience is not really surprised. It would appear that this is the true killer. But those in the audience who take one more step in their thinking will remember that there is one other purportedly killed in the car explosion. It is a woman, who never appears again. She is most likely to be the final, final true killer. This, however, is never confirmed in the movie.<br/><br/>Despite the fact that the ""clever twists"" have lost their freshness, this is a movie well worth watching, for the good direction (James Mangold) and cast which includes John Cusack, Ray Liotta, Amanda Peet, John Hawkes and Alfred Molina."
"zkonedog","9","1","1","12 March 2017"," Not The Movie You Think It Is
","AT face value, the conceit of this film seems like the set-up for every suspense picture ever made: A dark and stormy night, a collection of characters who congregate at a gloomy motel, and one by one they start dying off. While the film performs well inside of that characterization, it forgoes the traditional ""reveal of the killer"" in the end in favor of a much more mind-bending conclusion.<br/><br/>To not spoil things for the masses, the amazing twist near the end is roughly akin to what the TV show LOST has done over the span of six years. When LOST first started, creator JJ Abrams tricked us into thinking it was a show about a group of plane crash-ees trying to survive on an island. Six years later, the show is dealing with time-travel and the entire fate of civilization. Though ""Identity"" doesn't quite go THAT far, it follows a similar tract by not even closely resembling (at the end) the movie you thought you were watching in the beginning.<br/><br/>What keeps this movie from just being a curiosity, though, is that even after the jaw-dropping reveal, it still manages to wrap up the pseudo-plot line quite nicely. Basically, you can still be satisfied with the film even if the shocking ending doesn't do it for you.<br/><br/>Thus, if you are a fan of mystery/suspense thrillers and revel in big twists at the end, you will watch almost the entire final credits in a state of shock. Plus, even if you don't like huge plot surprises, the ""fake' storyline will still keep you on the edge of your seat."

","I would have rated it a perfect 10/10 if not because of this:<br/><br/>The movie ended with an inconclusive state for Ginny.<br/><br/>If we say she did not survive, we assume two scenarios: (1) Each key represents the personality that was killed off in Malcolm's psyche. So, all in all 10 personalities have died. (2) Ginny was the sixth one to be killed. This means that she has key #5 with her - remember that we are counting the killings in descending order.<br/><br/>HOWEVER..<br/><br/>It was shown nowhere in the movie how Ginny was killed by Timmy. So, it can be said that aside from Timmy (who was seen walking away from the car explosion), Ginny (whose body was never found after the explosion) also remained alive.<br/><br/>Although we can safely say that the reason why we never saw Ginny's body after the explosion was because it happened at the same time all the bodies started disappearing, it would have been better if they showed the scene where Timmy killed Ginny. Like, for example: As soon as Ginny and Timmy got inside the car, Timmy gets out while Ginny starts the engine. Timmy runs away from the car as far as he can (because he knows it's about to explode), and as Ginny steps out of the car to call Timmy, the car explodes."

You're relatively electrified for the first three quarters going full speed, and then comes Pruitt and the whole film suddenly drops to a lower gear. I'm not referring to the plot twist which involves Pruitt, I thought that was razor sharp, I mean the choice of casting him for that part ruined the final impact. Kind of mirroring my thoughts of Apocalypse Now. It was outstanding, until Brando emerged.<br/><br/>I wasn't impressed with Amanda Peet either mainly because I don't think she's that seasoned of an actress.<br/><br/>Some plot holes and casting issues exhibited what clearly could have been a small masterpiece. <br/><br/>Still, absolutely worth seeing."

","After a rather puzzling introduction sequence we find ourselves in the company of a motley group of individuals all of whom are stranded at a remote motel when bad weather washes the road out.

Is it one of their number, or someone else? Then another member of the group dies...<br/><br/>All this seems familiar enough stuff and, indeed, it is. Up to about the halfway mark. Then we realise that the fact that everyone is trapped here has some significance, and the movie goes in a direction which - to me, at least - is entirely unexpected.<br/><br/>A decent cast, headed by John Cusack and Ray Liotta, play this for all it's worth.

My advice is to see it in ""theatrical"" first, although ""extended"" will be tempting. The film is enjoyable on several levels, and the ""extended"" version will be more fun during a second viewing, when you're examining plot points, performances, and production style. The ""extended"" version includes a scene that implicitly gives too much information, due to its placement.<br/><br/>A terrific ""motel set"" was built for the picture, and is fantastically detailed. Production designer Mark Friedberg, art director Jess Gonchor, and set decorator Cindy Carr should have been nominated for ""Academy Awards"". The broken tiles, drain pipes, 8-tracks, and jigsaw puzzles are among the thousands of parts assembled for the décor of ""Identity"" and its crowded psychosis.

","Identity is about the most we can hope for from the drivel cranked out by Hollywood these days.  Remake an already established property, maybe provide a slight alteration for contemporary audiences, slap on a few big names and hope the audience takes the bait, which they usually do since their dying for just about anything that's even halfway palatable.  It's also, I think, the fourteenth version of Agatha Christie's ""Ten Little Indians"".<br/><br/>      I like John Cusack a lot.  Now that he's getting maybe fortyish, his face is acquiring more maturity and his overall presentation more humanity and depth.  His scene where he tells the ""slut"" (Amanda Peet) his reason for leaving the police force is particularly compelling.  Miss Peet is also good as the ""screamer"", the unlucky girl caught in the swill of events, and Ray Liotta does his wacko cop routine to great effectiveness. But a knockoff of Ten Little Indians is still a knockoff of Ten Little Indians, and the psychological ""twist"" that makes this version supposedly unique is something that you will remember for about as long as it takes to get to your car.  2 1/2 ** out of 4"

The movie itself was fairly superficial in terms of a storyline, but I soon came to realize that was the only way the story really could have presented itself.  The acting was pretty cookie-cutter, even from my man John Cusack, but some fairly interesting cinematography that was used to tell parts of the story more than made up for it.  The good news is that with a couple of exceptions, I was kept guessing throughout the film, and more than once I was completely dumbfounded.

Unfortunately that was only true for the first bit of this movie. I don't give spoilers in my reviews, but I must say 2 things. One, the big reveal that starts off the third act is a really good concept. Had it been done differently, I probably would have loved it, but really, it ruined the movie. Secondly, the reveal of the killer was again a great idea, but incredibly poorly executed. All potential, zero execution seven out of ten"

","When the defense attorneys for serial killer Malcolm Rivers discover that the prosecution suppressed evidence pointing to the man's insanity, a midnight hearing is held with a judge the night before his intended execution to consider the implications.  Meanwhile, a group of strangers stranded by a storm at a desert motel find themselves being killed off one-by-one.  The strangers slowly begin to realize that they aren't their by coincidence.  They all have a common link....<br/><br/>Director James Mangold starts the film off promisingly with atmosphere and tension galore.  Still, with the exception of the Malcolm Rivers angle, we are essentially being served up a warmed-over version of Agatha Christie's ""And Then There Were None.""  It is a true credit to that creaky old warhorse that the story hums along so effectively for so long.  Credit should also go to the excellent cast headed by John Cusack and Ray Liotta.  I found myself quickly drawn into the mystery, and I would be singing the praises if it weren't for the above-mentioned Malcolm Rivers angle.<br/><br/>SPOILER...<br/><br/>Thinking the audience would be bored with a simple Christie rehash, Mangold and company felt the need to give us a twist.  A big twist.  It turns out the characters at the motel are the multiple personalities in Rivers' head. They are being eliminated one by one as a single personality tries to take complete control.  Meanwhile, at the hearing, Rivers' psychiatrist tries to guide the process so that a benign, safe personality ultimately survives.<br/><br/>Okay, okay.  It was a interesting twist.  Clever, in fact.  Not as good as the one in ""The Sixth Sense,"" but certainly better than the inane one in ""Fight Club.""  Unfortunately, it was also completely wrong-headed.  I felt cheated.  I had spent over an hour making an emotional investment into the characters at the motel only to discover they weren't real.  After they revealed the twist, I no longer cared about the Cusack and company when we returned to the hotel.  What was the point?  They were just a fiction. <br/><br/>
Of course, the irony of my reaction was not lost on me.   All of the characters I ever cared about in movies were either wholly fictional or fictional depictions of real characters.  So why did it bother me here? Because the film makers had to nerve to show me the man behind the curtain. They robbed me of the hard-won illusion that what is happening on the screen was real.  That it mattered.  They stole away the magic, and I like my magic.<br/><br/>Some things are more important than being clever."

","This film looked so promising in the trailers.  And the first hour more than lives up to the promise.  The rainstorm, cheap motel, remote desert locations, and offbeat characters with secrets to hide make for a suspenseful horror-mystery.  The use of the hotel room keys was a clever device. The cast does well.  John Cusack is compelling in his first horror film, and Ray Liotta is well-cast as a seemingly inept policeman.  And the sultry Amanda Peets makes the most of her character. She is not a mindless sex object, helpless damsel-in-distress, or an invulnerable superwoman, but a frightened yet determined woman doing her best to stay alive. In addition, Rebecca DeMornay shows a terrific sence of humor and self-parody as a snooty, washed-up actress who stumbles into the confusion.  But just as the film seems to be nearing an exciting climax, it takes a disastrous wrong turn.  It becomes a dull psychological courtroom drama that undermines everything that has happened.

Incredibly pleased, that is until Timmy, movie wrecker in 4 and a half feet, waltzed on scene and said, ""whores don't get a second chance."" To quote the comic book guy, ""worst ending ever.""  I was perfectly happy with the killer that was revealed earlier (who I won't reveal because to me that was the real end of the movie).  I was perfectly happy with the movie up until the point where the sole (or so u think) survivor is hanging washing on a line. It should have been cut there.  End scene.  Why the homicidal child? It's so overdone and in this case badly done.  One would think there would be some clue that little Timmy is daemon spawn, but no.  He seems to be a perfectly normal kid.  I'm all for surprise endings, but they need to be realistic. Other then that Identity was great. I loved all of the twists.  I supposed thats what makes me so mad.  The movie didn't need another plot twist.  It was twisty enough. It seems as though some hack writer was sitting there one day and though, ""Hey, lets make Timmy the murderer! No one'll see that coming!"" Of course we won't. It doesn't make sense!

I like Cusack and Liotta - and Peet is very easy on the eye if nothing else. So far so good.<br/><br/>Director : James Mangold - did CopLand which I also liked.<br/><br/>Film : Through a series of accidents, bad luck, bad weather - 10 people end up in a Motel stranded. All strangers. Then they start to die. Great premise, nicely staged scenes at the motel where the viewer is left wondering who the hell is killing these guys. There are a few cliché characters but overall, the thing works for me. I enjoyed the paranoia in the rain-swept building as people begin to get bumped off one by one. There are also a few ""clues"" scattered in the early scenes which make you crease your eyebrows a little in a ""what the hell does that mean"" manner. Then it transpires that the apparent strangers are in fact linked- they all have the same birthday and all their last names represent a state in America - Maine/Rhodes/Dakota etc. By this stage I am about 70 minutes into the film and I too am intrigued as to how they will finish this - hoping they won't cop out and throw in a flimsy finish.<br/><br/>I was disappointed.<br/><br/>Suddenly, we flash to John Cusack in a chair in a room full of lawyers / doctors etc. and alternating between his own body and another fat guy's body by some quick camera cuts. What ??? We did see an earlier scene with this guy - who is trying to get off an electric chair sentence by some clever doctor talk - but the way it was presented was that this guy somehow killed all the people in the motel. At least that's how I picked it up. But in actuality - and this is a cop out if ever I saw one - John Cusack, the fat psycho and all the other people in the Motel are actually all figments of the fat guy's imagination, all different identities but only one of the identities is the real killer. So by getting them all together through the doc's talking - and getting them to kill each other off, he hopes to kill the killer's identity thus leaving the fat guy a harmless gimp. POOR !! POOR !! POOR !!<br/><br/>The film went from being a thinking man's movie - to a downright cheap, second-rate cash-in on the psychos fare !!!!<br/><br/>Great promise but it degraded to a shallow jump-out..."

","IDENTITY has an interesting if somewhat trite idea at its core. Unfortunately, the execution and the script destroy the whole concept. In order for a story like IDENTITY to work, the characters had to be compelling 3-dimensional folks with depth. Without interesting characters, the storyline suffers so much that the whole thing ends up feeling like a waste of time and a cheat. Had the characters been compelling, the sketchy concept would have worked because the movie-going audience would have believed the killer would have actually spent time in creating these people (or muses) and would rather spend time with them, and tormenting them, instead of the killer being alone with himself and tormenting himself. <br/><br/>As of now, the characters in IDENTITY are so boring and forgettable, or interchangeable, that it makes me wonder why would the killer even bother coming up with them? Or why would anyone in the audience care about these people, or types, at all? The film ends up being totally pointless and very predictable, and because of this, IDENTITY is surely one of the worst films I've seen in a while.

Maybe this movie is actually just part of a conspiracy by the director to round up everyone who was excited by the ""surprise ending"" and take them to a motel to celebrate its sequel where they'll all be systematically murdered for a snuff film.

"sirbriang2","4","4","10","6 May 2005"," good first half, awful plot twist ending
","NOTE: the spoiler comes toward the bottom and is clearly noted. Feel free to read the rest of this.<br/><br/>IDENTITY is one of those movies that just misses being great. However, just because this movie aims for the heavens doesn't mean that its graceless fall back to earth can be ignored.<br/><br/>On paper, this movie seems like a sure thing. John Cusak restrains his typical ranting character and does a good job as a penitent man. John C. McGinley (who is my favorite actor to see die in movies because I hate him so much) does a good job as a wussy husband/step-father. Rebecca DeMornay is good as a washed up actress (two words: type casting). Ray Liotta is pretty good, too, and even Jake Busey does a pretty good job, which is shocking. His death is pretty cool, too, but was unfortunately performed on a dummy.<br/><br/>Good actors need a good script, though. The material is good. This movie is based on the plot of Agatha Christie's TEN LITTLE INDIANS (AND THEN THERE WERE NONE), which is a good book and has been made into a good movie. However, someone decided to try a different angle for IDENTITY. Instead of using good source material and hiring and good screenwriter, they hired Michael Cooney. I'm sure you remember him better as the writer/director of JACK FROST and JACK FROST 2: REVENGE OF THE MUTANT KILLER SNOWMAN. No? Well, you're missing out on a homicidal snowman killing Shannon Elizabeth in her film debut. With a carrot. In her special place. Doesn't that sound like the right person to write a murder mystery with talented actors?<br/><br/>Obviously, it was. The writer clearly thought that adding not one but two plot twists that make the viewer not care about the characters or the linear plot was a good idea. After the plot twist, I felt as connected to these characters as I do to the bad guys in RAMBO III. This should have been a three or four star movie. The plot twist subtracts two stars automatically. Watch this movie if you want to be disappointed. Then watch CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD because you clearly want to punish yourself.<br/><br/>SPOILER COMING UP! BEWARE! <br/><br/>The movie is pretty good in the first half. There is a puzzling peripheral plot line about an insane convict having his sanity tested, but the rest of the movie is fine. Then the plot twist happens. All the characters in the murder mystery are symptoms of the convict's disassociative identity disorder (AKA multiple personalities)! What a great, edgy idea! Why should we care what happens to figments of someone's imagination? We shouldn't!<br/><br/>Whoa, the little kid is the killer? That's intense! No, it's not. It is stupid. It does not even take advantage of the whole unreality of the mind-scape. Instead, the kid turns out to be the mystery killer and we are led to believe that, somehow, he orchestrated all of the other murders, which is not possible. Had they played up the idea that anything can happen, then it might not have been so bad. But they played it straight. Had the kid been the killer in a movie where the characters were not imaginary, then it might have been cool. Puzzling and motiveless? Yes. Awful pot twist? Not necessarily. This script commits a sin of screen writing. It tries to outsmart the audience by introducing a ""guess the killer"" plot and then makes it absolutely impossible for the audience to fulfill their expectations. Wrapping it up in psychologist mumbo-jumbo doesn't excuse this, it just insults the audience's intelligence; we know when we are being messed with. Screw you, Michael Cooney. The cast and director are all pretty good; they should have known better than to be involved with this script."

","I'm stunned to see Identity rated so highly on IMDB.  For me, the movie started off simply being unpleasant - fairly exciting though, to give it credit - but not one of the characters had any charm to draw me in.  The unpleasantness continued for a while in typical Hollywood style...and then came the twist.  Most twists in movies are designed to make the story more interesting, or give the audience a new perspective: this one just eradicated any empathy anyone may have had with the characters.  The real let-down was that this wasn't the end of the movie, so we had to suffer a further 30 minutes or so of what had now become laughable drivel.  Come on guys, you can do better than this..."
"Dave-330","2","4","10","17 September 2003"," Where is Donald Kaufman's credit?
","Wow, some movies are difficult to describe, others are a lot easier, and this falls into the second category.  I rented ""Adaptation"" the last time I went to the video store and I did not like that movie much either, because it was overly slow, but there is one part that makes me laugh:  Donald Kaufman creates a script where the kidnapper, the cop and the kidnappee are all actually the same person... SPOILERS BEGIN... this is that movie. Charles Kaufman was making an overly critical statement of what has come to be considered a good film, and this movie actually uses a script mirroring the over-the-top script used in ""Adaptation"".  It is scary that a movie like this gets made in the first place.  The problems I have are from the start. First it is clearly Cusack's voice on the phone with Molina's character explaining the past.  It is clear that Molina supposedly started the ""cure"" on the phone with him, because how does the movie start without it, and if that is the case, why would you ""cure"" someone over the phone without having him properly watched in case something went wrong?  Why does Molina's character not know which identity killed the people as a child, especially if one of those involved is a child?  Did the child never come out and talk to Molina's character?  Then how did that identity get invited to the motel? END SPOILER<br/><br/>I will throw the non-spoiler positives in the middle, between the criticisms.  The cinematography and acting were pretty good.  I am usually quite hard on Cusack, but he gave a good performance and wasn't overly ""cute"" in the way that makes me want to shut off his movies.  This is his best performance since The Grifters and I enjoyed it.<br/><br/>Amanda Peet looks like a hooker, but that is what she was supposed to be and she too had a good performance.  Of course, she always looks good (even as a hooker) which doesn't hurt.<br/><br/>Jake Busey should had been used more instead of playing ""The Frighteners"" role again.  He is scary, but deserved more screen time instead of being just thrown into the story with little backstory.<br/><br/>The rest of the ensemble was fine, nothing great, but still over-achieving the script.<br/><br/>MORE SPOILERS  Now the Liotta turn was so obvious from when he tried to call an ambulance, it just was clear he wasn't a cop.  The scene where Cusack looks in the mirror was the best scene in the entire picture BUT let you too far into what was happening and then you stop caring about which characters survive because it doesn't matter anyway, because they are not real.  The kid being the killer was VERY obvious when the mother dies, because the kid goes in to see her alone and go figure, she's dead.  Having the kid die together with someone else was too obvious, ""Gee the m.o. of the killer is to kill one at a time, and leave a key card for each, do you think anyone will notice when we conveniently give ourselves an out by 'killing' two characters at once?  No of course not, we will have the bodies disappear, at that point and then let everyone know they are watching the thoughts of a serial killer and make no more references to the pesky keys until the end, plus we can 'shock' everyone by having the kid come back in the end because the audience will be too into the 'orange-growing feel good story of an obese man, believing himself to be a really hot woman' to notice.""  If you listen really closely, you can hear Charles Kaufman screaming at how awful the plot really sounds.  END SPOILERS.<br/><br/>I rate this movie the following way: 1 for the Cusack performance, 1 for Amanda Peet and 1 for Jake Busey, but -1 for obviousness of the plot curves and lack of creativity which gives it a 2 out of 10."

","Is this real? I mean, it's a pretty hokey film. I didn't even know they made stuff like this. Starts off alright, then becomes really great, and then tapers off with a really ridiculous plot twist. Really, this was a perfectly good crime thriller until they introduce the twist, and then it all starts to slowly fall apart. Maybe to some people it seems fine, but I don't like it at all. It feels like the retarded little brother of Memento and The Machinist, trying to be those films, yet coming out just slightly skewed. And under all of that gloss, it's just a slasher film, a Friday the 13th write off. Really doesn't look too good to write about this one on paper, rather than watching it. This movie feels very fake and artificial by the end, an attribute to which the plot twist does NOT help in the least, and it really unravels down to the bare bones of it's mediocrity with the absolutely horrible ending.<br/><br/>But this film isn't without moments, for it's rather enjoyable for the bulk of it's duration. Before the plot twist, you're really fired up and enjoying this one. I know I was. The interactions between characters and all of the kills are pretty enjoyable, but, it just keeps coming back to how bad it gets in the last 15 minutes or so.

","I dont see how everyone could have rated this movie as high as it is. As far as im concerned its probably the most cliched, mindless thriller i think ive ever seen.<br/><br/>Admittedly i really did enjoy the first 10 minutes or so. The 'cut' sequences were great. Actually the direction of the whole film wasnt bad at all, my commendations to James Mangold. After the kid moves back in the car scene, i thought the whole movie was going to be something really great. Unfortunately the rest of the movie did nothing but displease....<br/><br/>And theres nothing easier to blame for this than the script. You get the feeling that Michael Cooney (whos last film was Jack Frost 2: Revenge of the Mutant Killer Snowman) wrote it straight from beginning to end. It has a strong sense of momentum, but is horribly haphazardly meshed togeather in the end. It gives us every murder mystery cliche you could ever think of (psychotic ward scene, 'mass-murderer' suspect, indian burial ground, a house it is impossible to escape from till morning, a series of numbers along with everone who gets killed, etc.), but none add anything to the film. They are there for their own sake, and the film suffers as a consequence. Many many plot holes are brought out through the film (admittedly somewhat smoothed over by the sudden revelation that that the film is really told from the psycho killers perspective, not reality), and the terrible, unbelievable ending does nothing to fix them up, but just asks more questions.....<br/><br/>The acting was something else i could gripe about, not only from the 'unknowns' (the guy who plays the murderer brought in by the police is a standout), but also from people you expect more from (step forward Cusack and Liotta). I didnt believe anyone in their roles as 'realistic' characters, or even less as what they would be 'envisioned by the killer'.... but thats more debatable....<br/><br/>I often feel that a good movie is one which adds to your experience of the rest of the world....

","""Identity"" is a 2003 James Mangold Directed film about 10 strangers who meet at a seedy Nevada motel and soon realize that they are being killed off one by one. Let me start off by saying that I love a good thriller. If you have an intriguing premise and a good touch of tasteful twists here and there, I'll ultimately find the movie to be, to some degree, good. ""Identity"" definitely possessed the former, but tricked me with the latter. From the moment this movie starts you are almost immediately pulled into it's fascinating plot. And as the movie goes on, twists ensue, leading you to reconsider every view of every character in the film. However, the last twist of this film, in short, angered me. I found the final twist of the film to make sense, but it was the most unsatisfying ending I could have imagined this film to present. The film presented an incredibly new type of plot for me and in my opinion fudged up the ending a bit. However, every minute up to the last 5 were pretty thrilling and intense. All of the actors did a good job in their roles and their lines were fairly well written. The direction by Mangold is really quite beautiful - he really creates some unsettling imagery here. Overall, I can say that ""Identity"" was a enjoyable movie. . .up until the end."
"Doylenf","6","2","4","11 October 2009"," The plot is based on a combination of several past thrillers...
","IDENTITY is really a case of stolen identity.

There are shades of Agatha Christie, ""Psycho"" and several other stories that must have been the inspiration for the plot.<br/><br/>But sadly, the film is badly marred by some senseless revelations and a completely baffling twist ending that is surprising but unbelievable.<br/><br/>Good for any mystery fan who likes a story that makes you think, and well acted by RAY LIOTTA, JOHN CUSACK, ALFRED MOLINA and others, but misses being taken as a serious thriller by quite a wide margin."
"elshikh4","Null","2","4","12 December 2007"," Great.. And Almost Good. This is The Real Identity of This Movie !
","I'm aware that my title looks strange, but bear with me to understand that it's not that strange..<br/><br/>I'm a screenwriter myself, and let me tell you, it was very amusing to see how it works in my mind like this. I mean all of those characters, with their complicated conflicting attitudes, is the daily life of any author, of movies, plays, short stories, novels.. etc, and by all means, it was so fun to watch these enjoyable breathless conflicts, by those different characters, which came from the same mind, experience, and creation.<br/><br/>I loved how all the characters has the same birthday, with names of cities. Or how the mother of the author in the movie / the sick killer is in all the women of his own imagination as part irresponsible selfish (The actress), part good mom but dying (The mother of the kid), part swindler who acts like pregnant so she can force a man to marry her (Clea DuVall as Ginny), and part who's real pregnant and having Aids who committed suicide over a bridge (The memory of Ed), and of course the part of the prostitute who wants a second chance (The romantic prostitute). This is so clever in showing one of the profession's secrets, because this is how the writers work, and in the most simple and funny way too. Also it's how almost all of us put our personalities in so many forms, sometimes more attractive than us (Pruitt Taylor Vince became John Cusack as his pure version) yet with a purgation (Cusack as Ed nearly killed that wife, but he found the serial killer at the end, and died for it). It's the perfect game of that smart composition called ""Drama"" where one mind can be the killer, the killed, the officer who finds out the truth, and everybody else, not in that twisted way though, as you may find out the truth about one author from some point in his writings, or by the whole of it.<br/><br/>Hence, it's great for any screenwriter. But is it that great as a thriller? I don't think so. And the reasons are clear..<br/><br/>Yes, it's such a different plot amongst the deadly threadbare slasher movie plots, thanks to (Michael Cooney). Yes, it's very well acted and directed, sure (James Mangold) did a wonderful job. And yes, it has some nice references for iconic horror movies: The poor motel (Psycho), the Indian graves (The Shining), the multi-personality disorder (Raising Cain). But, it was that predictable. Because anyone in their right mind would ask logically what was the connection between what we were seeing in that creepy motel, and that late trial of the psychopath serial killer who had - as the movie itself brought up in its middle - a multi-personality disorder! That was a perfect hint in the perfect wrong place, especially with a character of a mysterious silent child, and a lot of history about the character early in the opening credit; surely we've learned from the best, I mean all the previous mysteries of the American cinema! Moreover, that hasty technique to present the twist as a premature climax; that wasn't talented at all to a dangerous extent. Because no one in the world would be connected with the story of the motel's alleged slasher anymore, as we all knew the real truth already. In fact, all the 20 minutes sequence in the end was un-thrilling, and the they could find so many solutions to make that more hot as they have done before in so many movies of which I can't tell about without so many spoiler alerts!<br/><br/>So the disappointment was large with that subversive way of writing the third act, and that kind of fabricated finale too with the killer going loose as if we will see (Identity 2: It's Not In My Mind!). It was just some kind of any exciting end to compensate the wasted suspense of that inadequate climax.<br/><br/>..Knew now what I meant by ""Great.. And Almost Good""?!<br/><br/>P.S: I got sick of the way the name of God is treated in Hollywood movies, and this one - in specific - has one of the ugliest profanities I have ever heard. It's as if the idea of ""holy"" is dead, and there is a marathon of calling it names as well!"

","I picked this movie up at Blockbuster after having been recommended it a long time ago. The beginning looked somewhat promising, and I enjoyed the use of a non-linear time-line. The way the many characters were brought together was even kind of clever(even though it's basically just a bunch of people driving in cars at the same place at the same time). Most of the accidents in the beginning was kind of dumb and even a tad staged; most of them seemed to have been easily avoided if the drivers would just pay attention to the road instead of doing everything else at once. Don't consider that a spoiler; it all happens within the first five minutes or so. The plot quickly turns into a regular 'Who Done It', with even the least attentive viewers being able to figure out the order in which order the people get whacked. The pacing tries to be intense, but fails to be so past the first ten minutes. I could barely keep paying attention to it. Up to the very end, this seemed to be a well-done and pretty but ultimately very pedestrian mystery-thriller, with no real surprises. Then came the twist. And it got so much worse. Not only was the twist easy to figure out and a horrible cop-out, it ruined everything the movie had built up(as little as there was) to that point. It kicked down every brick of the foundation of the film. Even worse, the film goes on for about fifteen minutes past that. And here's the real kicker; there's another twist. Even more painful, and even more predictable. You have been warned. If you still have any wish to see this movie at any point, I will objectively review what I haven't reviewed already. The characters are diverse and interesting, and they have a fair amount of development each. The cast does contain some very talented people, unfortunately, too few of them are given anything to do. Jake Busey and John C. McGinley are criminally underused. The film contains a few genuine scares and some decent enough guessing of the killer's identity.

There are some really surprising twits while others you can probably see coming. The film is also very scary especially since the setting is at some creepy motel in the middle of no where. The acting is pretty good with the best being John Cusack. He is kind of underrated though he has proved in the past that he can play any type of role. Amanda Peet is good though she tends to play the same character in every film. Ray Liotta does a good job as well. The rest of the cast include Clea DuVall, Rebecca De Mornay, Alfred Molina and John Hawkes. James Mangold directs and does a good job of keeping the audience guessing right until the end. The film is only 90 minutes long so it won't take up to much of your time. Though because of that, the characters aren't as interesting as they would had been if it was longer. The problem I had with Identity was the ending as it was kind of stupid. Everything before the ending though is entertaining and all the twists are done well even if their not original. But the ending nearly kills the film and if it would if everything before wasn't good. Still Identity is defiantly one of the better thrillers of 2003 and it's a must see.

","Identity is a stylish and toney film noir so deliciously old-school it should have been filmed in black and white.  Some of the comments I have seen regarding this film indicate that most viewers didn't get it.  That's understandable since it wasn't rolled out like a red carpet or spoon fed like most other movies.  <br/><br/>This movie was infinitely more imaginative and entertaining than the vapid and dreary poser film ""Memento"" that so many here enjoyed for some reason that still escapes me.  It succeeds where Memento fails, and delivers substance and style where Memento relies on device and contrivance.<br/><br/>John Cusack contributes immeasurably to this film, as he does to everything he does, but this is decidedly an ensemble piece. Despite comments elsewhere that indicate a lack of understanding of literary craft, the non-linear delivery is classic noir and takes full advantage of a genre that lesser films have tried to mine without out success. <br/><br/>Take your copy of Memento to a used disc store and see if they'll buy it back.

","It is a dark and stormy night. A violent thunderstorm howls down on a lonely Nevada road. A family of three is stopped by a blowout. While the father tries to change the tire, his wife is struck by a passing limousine. Despite the protests of the limo's passenger, a spoiled movie star, the driver takes them all to a nearby motel. The roads are washed out in both directions. The phone lines are down. Others seek shelter in the motel, which is run by a weirdo clerk.<br/><br/>Altogether, there are 10 guests. One by one, they die. Agatha Christie fans will assume that one of them is the murderer--or maybe it's the clerk. Meanwhile, the story intercuts an 11th-hour hearing for a man (Pruitt Taylor Vince) convicted of several savage murders. A grumpy judge has been awakened for this appeal, and unless he overturns his own ruling, the man will die. His psychiatrist (Alfred Molina) comes to his defense.<br/><br/>We don't know yet how these two stories will intersect, although they eventually must, but meanwhile events at the motel take our attention. We know the formula is familiar, and yet the treatment owes more to horror movies than to the classic whodunit. The group gathered at the motel includes the limousine driver (John Cusack), who says he is a former cop and seems kind of competent. There's another cop (Ray Liotta), who is transporting a killer (Jake Busey) in leg irons. The driver with the blowout (John C. McGinley) tenderly cares for his gravely injured wife (Leila Kenzle) while his solemn little son (Bret Loehr) looks on.<br/><br/>Also at the rain-swept rendezvous are the movie star (Rebecca De Mornay) who Cusack was driving; a hooker (Amanda Peet) on her way out of Nevada, and a young couple (William Lee Scott and Clea DuVall) who recently got married, for reasons still in dispute. The motel manager (John Hawkes) finds them all rooms--numbered from 1 to 10, of course.<br/><br/>While lightning rips through the sky and the electricity flickers, gruesome events start to occur. I will not describe them in detail, of course, since you will want to be horrified on your own. Although many in the group fear a mad killer is in their midst, and the Busey character is a prime suspect, some of the deaths are so peculiar it is hard to explain them--or to know whether they are murders, or a case of being in the wrong place at the wrong time.<br/><br/>That there is an explanation goes without saying. That I must not hint at it also goes without saying. I think it is possible that some audience members, employing the Law of Economy of Characters, so usefully described in my Bigger Little Movie Glossary , might be able to arrive at the solution slightly before the movie does, but this isn't the kind of movie where all is revealed in a sensational final moment. The director, James Mangold, and the writer, Michael Cooney, play fair, sort of, and once you understand their thinking you can trace back through the movie and see that they never cheated, exactly, although they were happy enough to point to the wrong conclusions.<br/><br/>A movie like this is an acid test for actors. Can they keep their self-respect while jammed in a room while grisly murders take place, everybody is screaming and blaming one another, heads turn up without bodies, bodies disappear--and, of course, it is a dark and stormy night? Cusack does the best job of surviving. His character is a competent and responsible person, while all about him are losing their heads (sometimes literally) and blaming it on him. I also liked Peet's hooker, who suggests she's seen so much trouble that all of this is simply more of the same. And there is something to be said for the performance of John Hawkes as the motel manager, although I can't say what it is without revealing a secret (no, it's not the secret you think).<br/><br/>I've seen a lot of movies that are intriguing for the first two acts and then go on autopilot with a formula ending. ""Identity"" is a rarity, a movie that seems to be on autopilot for the first two acts and then reveals that it was not, with a third act that causes us to rethink everything that has gone before. Ingenious, how simple and yet how devious the solution is."

","4 May 2003. Warning: Spoilers. It's difficult to really describe this movie without given away any of its twists and turns.

John Cusack provides his always reliable performance. While Ray Liotta, unfortunately continues his long progression of finding his character stereotypical roles (one of the only drawbacks in this movie).
This ""Twilight Zone"" surreal experience is a feast for the eyes because it relies not so much on gore and explicit in your face splatter, but on a more subtle but hard edge visual treat of hints, suggestions, eerie music, tight shots that all make for a classic thriller of the 50s.

"Horror-yo","7","0","0","8 October 2018"," Very well paced, but loses suspense a bit fast
","This sort of film is quite difficult to accomplish because it needs to be seamless between the events and actions taking place, and the theory behind them. The film makers have to be extremely careful not to give away too much, too early in the film, and they also have to make sure the film doesn't come across as one big explanation of itself (à la Inception). <br/><br/>The introduction is poignant and catches the viewer's attention quite immediately. That momentum rides into the whole bulk of the film but then it turns slightly flat. Eventually we realize that ""flat"" area is essential to the very point and understanding of the film, and that's when we get into the crux of the plot. The movie starts to explain itself, and that happens a little fast in the film which makes it, not so much predictable (because it's not) but rather switches off the intensity and genuine sense of mystery that had been maintained so far. It's almost like film and viewer partner up together to see the story progress logically. The ending is interesting and offers yet another twist to the story and avoids a disappointing final impression and it's making a genuine statement rather than just trying to be a dramatic ending with no meaning, as often in this sort of twisty tale.<br/><br/>The film probably suffers from a bit of herky jerky laying out of the plot, which interrupts the suspense before sparking it again some more, and would've benefited perhaps from a different setup.<br/><br/>The setting and casting are good, the acting is good (from all, but Cusack in particular) and visually the film is rather memorable. I would give this about 7/10."

In the other, there are 11 people stranded in a highway motel in a stormy night and each one gets killed one after another in a mysterious and gory way. Considering the second story belongs to a very formulaic thriller which has been staged time and again, it would be naive to think that it makes up the core of the plot as the movie meanders along. There are enough number of twists and turns that will make your head spin. However, at the end you come to realize those twists are the essential elements of the plot and are not overly used as some viewers complain. There's also a very fine line between the annoying ""everything was a dream"" trick and psychoanalysis inside the murderer's mind. This causes polarized intelligent reviews that sway between love and hate. If you can see past ""the dream"" ploy you'll appreciate Identity as a well scripted, well directed and well acted movie which deserves the generally high marks it earns from the reviewers' ratings."

","Identity is a nasty little shocker with more than a few tricks up its blood soaked sleeves. It rides on a daring concept that only becomes apparent in the final ten minutes of the film, but it's a shattering revelation that floors you. Up until then there's enough nerve spiking tension and plenty of good old fashioned suspense to keep you perked. Its a classic, Hitchcockian setup: Various wayward strangers find themselves stranded at an isolated interstate motel during a torrential rainstorm that wipes out phone reception and forces them to wait out the night. Pretty soon one of them is brutally murdered by an unseen assailant. Then another. And another, until they realize they are being picked off by a savage killer. Sounds like a generic premise, I know, but bear with me. This one shakes you up all to hell when it's finished with you, and will leave your thoughts racing and your arm hairs on end all night. John Cusack plays the bitter ex cop with a tragic past, Amanda Peet the hooker with aspirations, Ray Liotta the tough guy cop (who else?) escorting a weirdo convict (Jake Busey), John Hawkes the auspicious motel proprietor, John C. McGinley the timid family man, Rebecca Demornay the snobby actress, William Lee Scott and Clea Duvall the young Vegas married couple. Is one of them the killer? Or is someone outside their circle preying on them? There's also fine work from Alfred Molina, Pruitt Taylor Vince and Holmes Osborne. As far as guessing game psychological thrillers go, I dare you to arrogantly proclaim the outcome of this baby halfway through; it's just that creative, taking our expectations and strangling the life out of them, the resulting narrative a serpentine treat that pulls the rug from under our feet and smothers us with it.

","Sometimes I get so tired of those ""stream of consciousness"" films. In a better mood, I would be good enough to sit and listen calmly, as a professional and well-paid psychiatrist, absorbing all the emotional downpour and self-inflicting scars. Not all the time, though. So I really appreciate someone coming up with a good and well thought out film plot like this one. It is a pure story that carries all the weight. Even all the well-known and high-calibered actors are embarrassingly placed secondary or lower in certain cases. After the film, people would not be talking among themselves about Cusack, Liotta, Peet, Hawkes, or Vince, but the story and how it captures them. They would think and think about how they are completely deceived and tricked, and almost forget about other angles of the film. Serial murders in an isolated motel out there? No atmosphere is more typical and predictable. Then, it is not at all typical and predictable when the main actor, the story itself that is, unfolds. I saw this film a few years back and got the point, but not the delicateness of its presentation. Now, after some years and some film maturity, I notice. A film student would do himself or herself a big favor to watch this film several times to get the story and the way it is told. Some films are supposed to take us somewhere unfamiliar and yet believable. We the human beings are sometimes in need of an emotional makeover or an escapade, at least for an hour or a little longer. Too few of films today play that important role. Filmmakers use the filmmaking a little too much as a therapy for themselves and not always for the viewers. ""Identity"" is not even close to become a horror classic or a cult film, but it does what film lovers do: tell a good story without blinking."

","Psychiatrist Malick (Alfred Molina) is treating mass murderer Malcolm Rivers. It's the night before his execution and he's being transported to a hearing to determine his sanity. Meanwhile another part of the movie centers on an isolated motel. It's a torrential rainstorm in the middle of the night. George York (John C. McGinley) brings in his injured wife Alice (Leila Kenzle) and finds motel manager Larry (John Hawkes). Ed (John Cusack) the chauffeur distracted by spoiled actress Caroline Suzanne (Rebecca De Mornay) had run her over after the Yorks broke down by the side of the road. Con woman Paris (Amanda Peet) hit a telephone pole and knocks out the land line. The motel is cut off by flooding. Lou (William Lee Scott) and Ginny (Clea DuVall) are newlyweds as well as corrections officer Rhodes (Ray Liotta) who is transporting a prisoner (Jake Busey) are also stranded at the motel. The prisoner escapes and people starts dying.<br/><br/>The movie starts out as two related stories of a escaped killer. That is something a little bit off about the scenario but it's never quite obvious. For example, the movie doesn't need to go back to Dr. Malick if this is a simple slasher flick. The characters are all a bit specific. The total isolation seems too convenient. The movie seems to be a good B-movie with a lot of solid actors for the first two acts.

I don't know how the doctor treated him, he surprisingly makes the 10 identities together and makes them kill each other until one left.<br/><br/>I think Rivers loves acting too much so that he puts himself into his role play too deep, I'm sure he can win an award maybe in Hollywood, but for the best director, impossible as the story is too weak, even weaker than the American scary stories.<br/><br/>Fine get go, a quick conclusion: just so so."

","Identity starts off brilliantly. It has various flash-backs and flash-forwards to keep you all entertained and works almost as a puzzle. It's clever and engaging and lets us all get to know the wonderful array of characters who obviously end up stranded at a motel. From then on, Identity tries to pull in a slasher element that would work if it actually tried to be a horror film and not just a thriller with killings. I mean, if you look at James Mangold's previous works, ""3:10 to Yuma"", ""Walk the Line"" etc. He's not exactly in touch with the horror genre and that's almost what the film pretends to be.<br/><br/>Nevertheless it's very entertaining, but could've been executed better. The cast is great and the writing intelligent. Identity thrives off its characters, all of them different and engaging. You have to have a reaction when one of them gets the chop! The trouble being that the chops aren't very well done. Most of the kills are off-camera and don't generate up a lot of tension. Howver, it's the twist which the film thrives off. It had mixed reactions in my house. I thought it was really clever (although I had accidentally read an element of it before I'd actually seen it) and although something similar is regularly done in today's films (especially the horror genre) it was also buried under other elements which gives the film a whole new edge to it. Some might call it silly and pointless, but I call it original and intelligent.<br/><br/>Identity isn't much of a horror film, which is a shame because I'm sure if it was approached as a slasher I'm sure I'd be giving it a solid 8. It does generate thrills but not as many as you might imagine. Perhaps if it was done today, it would've had a better look and feel to it. But that's not to say it's a bad film, because its not. It's genuinely interesting, has fantastic character development and is also extremely atmospheric with its use of pathetic fallacy and claustrophobia. It's worth a see, but don't go expecting something as great as some people like to paint."

The story then begins with a crash, involving a car/pedestrian. This is where John Cusacks character comes in. In a remote part of Nevada, on a stormy night 10 people are stuck for the night. As the movie goes along the characters start getting bumped off. It's like a who done it and nobody trusts anyone, especially the convict that is among the group.Little does the viewer know that this is all playing out in Malcolm Rivers head, and these 10 people are all his identities. In order for him to escape the death penalty Malcolm must convince his doctor, judge, etc. that his treatment has worked and the killer is gone, so he can go into a state hospital , instead of being put to death. In the end they decide to take him into a state run hospital for the remainder of his sentence. In the end there's a twist that even got me. I recommend this thriller to anybody, you gotta C it; it doesn't disappoint. THX, Kris L. CocKayne"

","As of late, one of the things that irks me about thriller films is that it offers lots of style and nothing more in between. Thankfully ""Identity"" isn't one thriller that fits in that category as it provides for you a compelling dark and provocative story, complimented by an ensemble of talented performers and an atmosphere that will likely send chills up and down your spine.<br/><br/>The story takes place in a cramped little motel on a dark and dreary night. Ten strangers show up in the motel who may have been brought here by coincidence or does their presence stem much further than that? They think they're safe in this cozy little motel, but then they gradually discover that one-by-one, several people were getting hacked left, right, front and centre What may seem like it's just a crazed murderer on the prowl just randomly killing people for kicks, the boiling point goes far more macabre than any of the individuals could imagine. Were these strangers chosen randomly or did they know that they were doomed from the start? Granted, I had my doubts when I first saw ""Identity"" in the theatres nine years ago. I thought it was just another mindless thriller with another repetitive predictable ending. Well it turned out I had to take my words back on this one. The craft by director James Mangold by utilizing various plot twists succeeds in demonstrating the ins and outs of how a thriller movie should be done. There is a cornucopia of frightening scenes that might inspire you to sleep with the lights turned on if you're watching this movie alone at night. It's also not at all ashamed of playing games with your mind and represents itself in a very confident matter. Some of the well known thespians featured in ""Idenity"" include the always versatile John Cusack, Ray Liotta with his perpetual menacing demeanour, Amanda Peet with her combined beauty and charm and Rebecca DeMornay with her solid delivery of lines. They all shined splendidly in their respected roles. But it was Cusack who surprised me for being a capable actor in a thriller movie.<br/><br/>The DVD has a few little extra tidbits added in for further information about the movie and some extended scenes that were left out in the theatres. However, the extensions are really not worth mentioning. Even the alternated ending was really all not worthy to take note of either. But it's the theatrical version that one should see, but if you're curious about the extended versions well I'll be the last person to stop anyone from seeing it. And as usual there's the deleted scenes, the wonderful commentary, and of course the little featurette to go behind the scenes of the movie.<br/><br/>""Identity"" is a break from the monotony from the god-awful excuses that have the audacity to label themselves as thrillers. The film offers 90 minutes of chilling scenes that will surely make your eyes pop out and you tongue hang out. The script was brilliantly edited and the cast was very impressive. Those who were doubtful of the how this movie will transpire (guilty!) it will have you think twice before you count your chickens. The mind games continually progress throughout the movie as you'll be mesmerized by everything that was showcased on the screen. This is truly the thriller among thrillers and will manipulate you to watch this again and again."

","Stranded at a desolate Nevada motel during a nasty rainstorm, ten strangers become acquainted with each other when they realize that they're being killed off one by one.<br/><br/>Everyday we see another cliché horror flick. We get it, it's all been done before, and we want to something new. When I first heard of Identity, I had mixed feelings. I had this feeling in me that this actually looks pretty good, but the other half held what I thought about horror films in general. After ALL those endless good reviews, I sat down to see what the big deal was... Identity was fantastic. The tension was so high and the suspense levels were max. At one point, I had to go pee so bad. In this movie, I didn't even THINK of going to the restroom, because the movie glues you to your seat. Now that's movie-making. The movie progresses like any other has, and this may turn you off. But the thing that possessed me was that feeling you get that SOMETHING is lurking in the background. You don't know what it could possibly be, so your wanting to sit and see. The acting ties in with this too. The actors seemed to be so in their role, it was great. You could tell maybe even them were feeling that something was there too, that great suspenseful feeling movies leave out nowadays. Not once did I even question the acting from all these new and old actors. Now the twists... the twist! If you haven't already seen this movie, I'm going to tell you this again, this is spoiler-filled. I cannot express how good the movie is until I explain the twist, so I suggest you go see the movie otherwise. THE TWIST! Never have I loved a twist so much, because it surprises you and makes you crazy at the same time. You learn that all of this was the thoughts of a guy who has something called personality disorder. This causes him to have multiple personalities at the same time, and he's living inside of his thoughts. Thing is, he's murdered this people and is basically living their lives out inside his head. It may sound a little far-fetched, but this is a MOVIE and people who are complaining should go watch their 'realistic' movies. The way they filmed the big twist was actually really cool. It was making you feel like YOU were in the mind of this guy, and even more twists lie after that one. All in all, I totally recommend this film. It's a thriller masterpiece, filled with so many twists and turns, your most likely going to have the urge to watch it again to catch new things. It's a movie experience, from however you look at it, and I loved it. 8/10."

","Unquestionably one of the brightest lights on the spotty landscape of 21st Century horror, Identity fuses the best elements of modern macabre with strong nods to the classic slasher films of the genre's past, and enough tightly-executed twists to drive several films.<br/><br/>The plot is basically an updated riff on Agatha Christie's Ten Little Indians (it's even mentioned in the film), with 10 strangers steered by fate to converge at a desolate motel during a sinister storm. The torrential rain renders all outbound roads flooded and strands the group without cell phone reception or even radio contact. Naturally, these marooned guests start being killed off one by one, and as the dwindling survivors struggle to identify the murderer in their midst, they gradually discover that they may have more in common than they suspect, and something far more malevolent than simple coincidence may be responsible for their common plight.<br/><br/>If done right, this basic storyline would be more than enough meat to shape an entertaining thriller, but Identity isn't content to settle for being a straight-forward whodunnit. Here, discovering who the victims are is just as crucial as outing the killer, and even after the grand design of the murders has been revealed, the film rolls out one final swerve that turns what we though we knew upside down and concludes the tale on a grim, ghoulish note.<br/><br/>I won't spoil any of the myriad twists for you here, but part of what makes Identity such a well-crafted creation is how well is stands up to repeated viewings once you know how the whole thing turns out. The skillful placement of the jigsaw pieces makes this a fun puzzle to assemble even after you've seen the completed picture, and supplementary visits to this morbid motel reveal the intricacies of the broader mystery.<br/><br/>Of course, the excellent cast is key to the experience. Playing directly against type, John Cusack proves to be a fantastic lead for a thriller, and the novel placement of Cusack in a horror film is enough on its own to warrant a look at Identity. Ray Liotta is pretty much great in every movie he turns up in, and Amanda Peet essays a strong heroine who continues the refreshing tradition of resourceful female characters which have become a dependable genre presence since Scream mocked and shattered the hysterical ""chicks in peril"" archetypes of horror's past. The ensemble is rounded out by a slew of solid character actors, whose battling personalities ratchet up the tension within the claustrophobic locale.<br/><br/>Though a couple of the murders are clearly telegraphed, the majority of the deaths in Identity arrive in surprising ways, and the unpredictability factor lends the film an aura of meticulously chiseled dread and suspense. Admittedly, it's not hard to figure out who's going to be around for the climax, but since the film holds one more turn up its sleeve at that point, even the fairly standard resolution ends up being a set up for something bigger.<br/><br/>There's plenty of gore to please fans of old school splatter, as well a few sturdy scares, so since this is ultimately just a thoughtful update of the standard stalk-and-slash formula, we end up being grateful to the film-makers for not settling for a purely mainstream thriller at the expense of sacrificing the pure horror elements.<br/><br/>Despite the renaissance the horror genre has enjoyed in the new century, very few genuine classics have emerged from the pack, and for those of us weaned on the iconic films of the '70s and '80s, the bulk of the contemporary fright flicks have been hollow imitators (and, increasingly, blasphemous ""re-imaginings"") of those legendary offerings. Identity balances the best of both schools, managing to be both familiar and original at once, and this terse, unrelenting exercise in bare bones horror is an enthralling and enjoyable ride. Highly recommended."

","On a random stormy night, eleven strangers get caught in the weather and all end up in the same desolated motel in the Nevada wastelands.

If you expect nothing, maybe some cheesy murders and some gore, you are in for a great surprise.<br/><br/>Identity is more than a tense thriller; it is above all a clever thriller with great scenery and excellent acting, and above all, a surprising and satisfying plot. It is not a film that one needs to think about deeply to understand, but it will not be easily forgotten.<br/><br/>Although the film takes place in the deserted motel for almost the entirety of the movie, it is a cleverly chosen location and has proved to work wonders. With excellent performances of the well-casted John Cusack, Amanda Peet and John Hawkes, and powerful supporting roles of Alfred Molina, Clea DuVall and John C. McGinley, Identity doesn't fail to satisfy in that area either. I didn't particularly like Ray Liotta, but I'm sure that fans of his work will appreciate him here as well.<br/><br/>The greatest asset of this movie is its great and unexpected twist, that will leave you surprised and amazed long after the ending credits roll.<br/><br/>You cannot afford to to miss out on this brilliant 'edge-of-your-seat' masterpiece."

","I like movies that play with your mind, but in the end you see that everything fits in place. Some good examples are Memento, The Usual Suspects, or Fight Club.<br/><br/>I picked up Identity mostly because it looked interesting and stars John Cusack, whom I believe is grossly underrated in general. It turned out to be a heck of a 90 minute ride! I didn't see the plot twist coming, and I found everything to be very satisfying.<br/><br/>You'll see parallels to Psycho and Ten Little Indians, but Identity is unique. A little too violent to be generally recommendable (I don't care for slasher flicks), too good to pass up. I'll give it a 7, and personally rate it an 8 for those who are less squeamish, yet enjoy an intelligent movie. Think ""Silence of the Lambs"" for violence/intelligence, although of course that's a much different type of movie."

","Identity was one of the first movies I saw that affected me psychologically. By the time it was done, it had taxed my brain and left me feeling very scared. The film is well directed, very well written, and well acted.<br/><br/>It's a cold, dark, and rainy night. 10 strangers, including a cautious stepfather (John McGinley), an FBI agent (Ray Liotta), a convicted killer (Jake Busey), a prostitute (Amanda Peet), a hotel manager (John Hawkes), and a former cop turned limo driver (John Cusack), will have their lives dangerously intertwine at a rundown motel and be horrified as they are 'eliminated' one by one, with no clue who the killer could be. What ensues is a dangerously good episode of psychological horror.<br/><br/>The music is very good, but it felt like there were those moments where they used it to foreshadow a scary bit. The cinematography is also top-notch, setting a brilliantly dark mood that really helps the horror aspects of the film. The cast works well as an ensemble, each playing their parts well. McGinley definitely drops his extremely funny reputation to play George York in a great way. A nice change for him. Ray Liotta is in top form as the mysterious FBI agent Rhodes. He and Cusack steal the show. Cusack's character is a great examination of how layered one man can be. We're never clear of what his character's motives are, but we are sure of one thing. He's the good guy. The performance of Amanda Peet was nice, but got a tad annoying as the movie dragged on. John Hawkes played a good part, while Jake Busey was extremely scary and creepy as a serial killer. Alfred Molina and Pruitt Taylor Vince appear in smaller roles. Molina is very convincing as a psychologist, and Vince is simply spectacular as the character Malcolm Rivers, a character who is so layered, deep, and central, that if I were to add more about him, it would spoil the movie. Identity is a classic psychological horror film that I always enjoy watching. The ending is very good, and will make you gasp. Definitely one of the biggest twists in a long time. I highly recommend 'Identity'.<br/><br/>9/10 --spy"

","You know, it really gets to me that this movie could have done better. Sure, the whole thing with all the people being personalities in his head was good and all, but what was the point of killing them all off just so he wouldn't kill again? The guy was already tied up and all that, there was no way he was going to kill again. So I wonder what the hell the point of this whole movie was, except to put some crazy plot twist in it. It seems like the only reason they made this movie was to try and surprise us. The movie, after the plot twist was found out, had no real meaning. Everything that had happened before wasn't real and it just disappointed me somewhat. However, the concept was good, but they could have done it much better. I'm not saying I could have done better, but it definitely left me feeling down rather than up. I did like the ending though. Not to spoil it, but it's pretty good. But the ending can't be the whole movie. It has to have substance throughout, like the Usual Suspects."

","I don't really understand the criticism of this movie. It seems to go along the line of people liking the start and then deciding for one reason or another (acting, the twists, not being supernatural) that it is a bad movie. Well I think the acting is fine as you would expect from a movie with john cusack in it. Admittedly the screaming bit in the middle where the girl runs off is a little cliched but who cares. Should we really be so pretentious as to say 'oh I saw something similar in another movie'. I thought the movie was original (It's about as much like fight club as any cop movie is like another cop movie so don't make comparisons) and the twists are well done and well integrated into the plot and keep you guessing until the end. The twist at the end wasn't put in willy nilly as a way of making it interesting, it was integral to the whole plot.

One criticism is that Amanda Peet's character did not look trashy enough for her role as a hooker. I see many girls today dress trashier than Amanda's character and they're not hookers!  John Cusack did an okay job acting, but it was not one of his better parts.  My biggest criticism is the ending flashback of the killer commiting various murders -- I found it had a certain silliness which was certainly not the intended effect.  The film has a certain low budget feel, but it's not a terrible thing.  However, despite some flaws, I still recommend this film for its originality, suspense and clever plot twists."

Also like Memento, it keeps coming back to a second storyline, the Silence of the Lambs/Hannibal Psychiatrist character, who is separated from the Bates Motel storyline.<br/><br/>After this, however, it goes on to become a cracking good thriller.

","1st watched 3/20/2004  - 7 out of 10(Dir- James Mangold): Complex psychological thriller that ends up being a story-within-a-story. I don't want to give away too much so all I'm going to say is that this is a well-done scary movie that starts out as a drama about a bunch of people and how they end up stopping at the same motel and then 1-by-1 those that are present start dying.  Eventually we find out that they all have something in common(I'll leave that for the viewer).  The director does a good job of re-directing our focus so that we have no idea what's going on until the final surprise half-hour.  Known for his cop movies, this is a departure for him but he does an excellent job with the material.  The acting is credible enough but it's the story that's really the star in this movie.  It's similar to a TEN LITTLE INDIANS type of plot but it doesn't go the same direction.  All-in-all this is scary well-done escapism with a twisted ending."

There are many puzzles to solve but it keeps you anyway asking if there is a logic for all these victims. Here is perhaps the weak point of the movie but hey it is just a movie and that must not be always a realistic one. If you have enough fantasy and imagination you can enjoy it. I think the director developed the story deep enough or too much. Perhaps some scenes could have been deleted. I have to admit that there was a surprisingly end that lets even open for a sequel. Picture was well done. I warn you there are many bloody scenes and much violence and is not an usual thriller.

"RareSlashersReviewed","Null","0","0","10 March 2004"," James Mangold's psychological thriller/slasher...
","* There's a slight spoiler herein, but nothing that ruins the plot<br/><br/>
James Mangold's Identity received the most divided reviews of 2003. Playing like a mystery-slasher with a psychological film noir twist, it's almost like an authentic amalgamation of elements from Ten Little Indians, Angel Heart and the kind of shocking conclusion usually found in movies like Jacob's Ladder.  Some non-complimentary word of mouth didn't keep audiences away, and the film made a tidy sum in America alone, before repeating the success this side of the Atlantic. I'm of the firm belief that Mangold is one of the most talented and unfairly underrated filmmakers working in cinema today. Cop Land especially impressed me, I also liked Girl, Interrupted and let's face it - any one that can drag a credible performance from Sylvester Stallone must be doing something right! All of his efforts have boasted excellent casting decisions, from re-teaming DeNiro and Keitel to winning Angelina Jolie an Oscar; - the man is certainly one to be watched! Shot almost entirely on a soundstage, this includes some of the most realistic sets and impressive lighting ever set to celluloid.<br/><br/>
After a brilliant credit sequence filled to the brim with subtle clues of what lies ahead of you, we jump headfirst into the action. Whilst chauffeuring a conceited actress (Rebecca De Morney) across a desolate dessert road, limo driver Ed (John Cusack) accidentally runs down an unfortunate mother in front of her quiet and traumatised son (Bret Loehr). Her husband (John C. McGinely) is mortified, so Ed drives them to the nearest motel to call for help. The area is in the midst of one of the worst storms in recent history and on arrival they learn that the phone-lines are down and they have no contact with the outside world. The crisis fuelled family and the clearly disgruntled actress render themselves a room from the dodgy manager (John Hawkes), whilst the driver heads out into the gloomy night sky to search for a hospital or medical centre. On his journey he picks up stranded ex-hooker Paris (Amanda Peet) before crashing his Lincoln into a ditch of water that has been created by the excessive downpour. Luckily another car pulls up seconds later and the newly-weds (Clea DuVall and William Scott Lee) inform them that the roads are also flooded in the opposite direction. The group return to the creepy motel, where it seems that they're marooned for the night, whether they like it or not. Things take a turn for the worse, when a grizzled cop (Ray Liotta) that's transferring a homicidal maniac (Jake Busey) turn up in the car park also looking for somewhere to bed down until the weather clears up. A short time later the actress is murdered and decapitated; they find her blooded head in a tumble dryer with a key scripted with the number 10, planted underneath. And so begins the countdown of terror as each of the visitors is brutally murdered by an unseen psychopath, who leaves corresponding keys, by their corpses.<br/><br/>A strong cast has been a necessity to all of Mangold's movies. Here, the always-dependable Cusack plays it straight and Liotta delivers an intense and three-dimensional performance, leading a studded ensemble of intriguing and capable character actors. Too many studios have ignored John C. McGinely for far too long. I believe that he nearly always gives a credible performance in almost everything that he's done. Playing a panicking but quaint stepfather to a needy son was strictly against his typical type, but he handles the part with finesse, never over-pleading for audience's sympathy and just giving us a convincing turn.  John Hawkes almost steals the show from the leads on occasion as the shaky motel manager and Rebecca De Morney proves here, more than ever, that she's an actress with an incredible amount of front! Seriously, she brings a great quantity of life to her brief cameo, still looking ravishing as she hits the big four-zero. Even though the characters are introduced in quick succession, it never feels like their personas are underdeveloped and the director does well to expand their individual characteristics early in the runtime, so that he can let the plot take over and dispel any unnecessary time-wasting.<br/><br/>
Certain scenes are riddled with a great deal of suspense and the atmosphere is set from the off, never loosening its grip on the viewer's intrigue. The film may not be graphic in the terms that bloodhounds are typically accustomed with, but like Halloween, Chainsaw Massacre or Psycho, Mangold portrays the message through suggestion rather than gratuitous gore. Alan Silvestri's score whips up an amazing amount of tension and the lighting is no less than excellent, even filling in for the music, in the scenes that were screened in near-silence. Michael Coone shows a flair for black comedy in places with his script, and each character has their own secretive mysterious edge that makes them uniquely interesting. The shocks are screened without any build up or warning, so predictability is never an issue and you'll rarely know what's waiting around the corner, or exactly who will be next to die. At various points in the runtime I was awestruck by some of the flashes of genius on display, everything from the use of light and sound was top-drawer professionalism. If I hadn't have learned the truth from the production notes, I would've bet my life that this was shot on location. You'd never in a million years guess that we were watching a soundstage, and the constant barrage of rain was tremendously authentic.<br/><br/>The whodunit aspect was smart and beguiling, all the way up to the final when it falls into an inconsequent twist that's more nonsensical than intelligent. Mangold should have stuck with the 'Last Stop'-type storyline and completely dispersed the use of uncle fester's b**stard offspring as a conclusion. The method taken by Coone is one of the most predominantly used in serial killer flicks and although it's an authentic take-on a tired formula, it's far too obstinate to gather the recognition that it sets out to acclaim. I'd like to see a 'director's cut' that removed the scenes that I've mentioned and just played things by the overused, but still welcoming premise. After the twist, I was left feeling a little let down that the movie was not as clever as it was built up to be. However, I must confess that a small part of me recognised the ingenuity and I was in two minds after the outcome. I guess some viewers will be impressed whilst others will end up truly disappointed, which would probably explain critic's split decisions.<br/><br/>Although there is niggles to be found in places, I recommend Identity as a strong thriller with some great moments, all the same. It's a slasher movie with a brain instead of gallons of blood, and a cast that a maniac would kill for. After Narc and this, lets hope Ray Liotta's next performance wins the Oscar that he's deserved since Goodfellas, just as long as we don't have to suffer any more turbulence! Most definitely worth a rental, if not a full-on purchase! Give it a go."

In its own way the film was actually pretty pacey and I think it worked better being only some 90 minutes long. It might have dragged a little being any longer. Thought all of the characters were good and added to the overall mood of the film.<br/><br/>The story may well be not as original as we thought it was but it kept our interest with all the various twists. It relied upon the plot, script and acting to keep it going and all in all it worked very well.<br/><br/>We saw it on a recommendation and would likewise recommend it to anyone."

","** Spoilers ** Spoilers ** Spoilers ** Spoilers **<br/><br/>(First, since some seem to have problems with this part: Ginny and the boy disappears at the moment when all the bodies are disappearing. They are assumed to have been killed and the bodies vaporized, just as all the other corpses have been.)<br/><br/>This movie is very much in the same school as Usual Suspects, in that it has a ""waking up in the shower"" (expression born with the ""twist"" in the Dallas soap) twist. But just as in Usual Suspects, it works!<br/><br/>If you expect a regular monster movie, you'll either be happily surprised or disappointed. In my own opinion, this was something far more interesting and sophisticated than I had expected. Like Usual Suspects, the story breaks the rules of conventional storytelling, but does it successfully. However, it _demands_ of you as a viewer that you go along with it.<br/><br/>It helps to have read some ""surreal"" writers, such as Philip K. Dick or William Burroughs. To have a mind that's conditioned to go with the flow and accept that a story can be relevant on a purely associative level, even if what it describes isn't consistent or ""real"" even in its own story universe. Even if it's not real, it can still be relevant. The story in Usual Suspects--which is a lie--is relevant because it's Keyser Soze's way of escaping the law and demonstrating his superiority over the smart police officer. In Identity the story--which is a figment of the protagonist's imagination--is relevant because he's fighting a battle with his multiple personalities and his life is at stake.<br/><br/>(I should add that the story is psychologically whole unbelievable, but that's not important. It's also hard to understand why we should root for the killer. If you're an opponent of the death penalty, it may be interesting to see that he's not executed.)<br/><br/>Anyone who's tried their hand at writing fiction knows how hard it is to follow the rules. Breaking them successfully is a whole different ballgame. Identity is skillfully written and adequately (and then some) executed. Personally I'm delighted that Hollywood has the guts to give us something more advanced than the usual formulaic thrills at times. I'd even go so far as to claim that it's these types of movies that advance the medium in the mainstream, even if Usual Suspects and, for example Terry Gilliam's Twelve Monkeys, are superior movies and have been more important in that respect."

It has all the markings of a pretty well-structured horror film, but most of the cliches, too, including the--stop reading if you haven't seen it-- ruinous multiple personality cop-out ending.  If the writers really thought that all the characters existing in the mind of one man would be ""the payoff"" (as Maggie Gyllenhaal's character in Adaptation suggested of ""the 3""), then they're fooling themselves, and cheating too many of us out of our $10.  (Luckily I saw it on a plane so I only lost two hours of my life.  Still, I'd like them back.)"

"nwitham78","6","0","0","14 January 2004"," Excellent direction...
","Review of James Mangold's Identity<br/><br/>Seemingly influenced in equal amounts by Fincher, Hitchcock and Agatha Christie, James Mangold has produced an interesting and intriguing piece.<br/><br/>Ten individuals with one thing in common find themselves stranded in a desert motel in the pouring rain. Cue the beginning of a string of gruesome murders, and the inevitability that all of the group will eventually become victims.<br/><br/>Filmed on a set bearing an immense resemblance to that of Psycho, the story is that of murder-mystery crossed with horror, culminating in an interesting, Fincher-esque twist. The basic premise of the movie is exciting to me, and it is shot with beautiful precision, in deep greys and reds, that combine with exceptional cinematography to give an awesome visual impression. The cast sets some established actors (Cusack and Liotta) with others (Amanda Peet and John Hawkes) with less experience, in an interesting ensemble.<br/><br/>Throughout the film, I was impressed with the shooting and general ambience created. The acting, whilst a tad patchy in places was convincing, and this aided the director in his attempts to inflict upon the audience suspense of Hitchcockian levels. The one let down in my opinion was the scripting. Michael Cooney has been responsible for some serious misjudgements of screen writing in the past. This is not one of them. Thematically, the movie is excellent, with, in my opinion (here differing to many critics) the last third delivering an admirable twist and interesting look at the psychology of criminals. But for me, the actual dialogue was less than impressive. Some of William Lee Scott's lines were delivered in pure accordance to the Tarantino style guide, which provided me with a smile, but most of the rest of the film was let down by interminably formulaic and unbelievable dialogue.<br/><br/>Overall, it seems to me that Identity is a triumph of direction, and is an exciting step in Mangold's career. Roger Ebert wrote in his review that the viewer could work out who committed the murders in the before this is revealed. I feel that this rather confused view of the film is one that many viewers will disagree with; and I essentially believe that this film is worth watching for all fans of a wide range of genres: the thriller, horror, and pure whodunits (especially anyone who has read Christie's And Then There Were None). But this is by no stretch of the imagination a modern classic. The dialogue is lacking too much in intensity for it to be classed in the same bracket as Fincher's first two films (Se7en and Fight Club) or indeed with any of Hitchcock's genre defining efforts. But in terms of enjoyable cinema, and well-educated direction, this is definitely worth a watch."

","I applaud Mr Mangold for making an excellent film, and for telling a unique story. The motif of the dark stormy night, and the cheap motel invokes the a 'Film Noir' feel to the movie. Strong performances by all the cast, including John Cusack, Amanda Peet, and John C McGinley. This movie is an exploration of the ""reality"" of the inner mind, and it's power to shape reality to it's own preferences. My only criticism is that the movie seems to move backwards and forwards in some parts, thus confusing the viewer that the Point of View may be in flashback. I think the story would have been just as effective to not use the flashback scenes, and just show everything in chronological order. The flashback technique, though well executed in this movie, does nothing to enhance the story, or the viewer's understanding of the film, unless of course the director wanted to that merely to keep the audience off balance."

","CAUTION: SOME SMALL SPOILERS AHEAD! Even though I was able to figure out the hidden plot, and the killer before the end, I was still on the edge of my seat the whole time. It goes to show you that if you have a really good cast and director, a simplistic, yet well-applied plot can be worth the effort. If you ever studied psychology, you can pick up what's going on pretty early. There are 10 people, who all have a few, specific things in common. They get stuck together in a motel (reminiscent of a few episodes of the Twilight Zone) and are barred from leaving by seemingly unrelated things (The rain, which is a character in the movie itself Â– nice touch; the phones all being dead; the `accidents' that seem to bring everyone together in the first place). They start to die off one by one, and what starts out like a typical where-is-the-psycho-killer-hiding slasher flick, begins to get stranger and more mysterious. The movie gives some obvious, but easily missed clues about some of the characters that are cool to catch the second time around, or after you've watched and are thinking about it. The very end of the movie bothered me a bit in that it seemed typical of most B-horror flicks, but it is forgivable. John Cusack is one of my favorites, and he didn't disappoint here either. He brought a gentle strength that neither disappeared nor went overboard. And while some people have complained of overacting or overdone dialogue, I think the cast did an excellent job and that it fit in the film. Think `And Then There Were None', `Psycho', `The Twilight Zone' and `Memento' and you've got `Identity'. Not as strong as the predecessors above, but still good entertainment."

Even if it was cliched, Identity would still be suspenseful. Director James Mangold seems to really know what hes doing here. I dont know much about the rest of his work but I have heard he has done some solid films.<br/><br/>
The acting definitely elevates Identity. While not award-winning performances, they are solid. John Cusack does a solid job in his role. Ray Liotta will forever be typecast as a tough guy, but hes so damn good you wont care. Amanda Peet does a nice job with her performance. John Hawkes is frequently scene stealing. Everyone else gives solid support.<br/><br/>
Identity has a surprise around every corner. They deal with exactly why the characters are at the hotel and there is a surprise ending. Unfortunately, the surprise ending is a bit of a letdown. Its not that the thing with multiple personalities is not clever, its just that I did not totally get it. I dont want to say it had no logic in it but I just dont know. It may require another viewing. <br/><br/>Overall, I was satisfied by Identity. It was a breath of fresh air for this year. I recommend Identity to pretty much everyone."

","A hotel on the outskirts of Las Vegas, Nevada is the primary setting for the new film Identify, directed by James Mangold (last behind the camera in Kate & Leopold) and written by Michael Cooney, who's last credit was Jack Frost II: Revenge of the Mutant Killer Snowmen.<br/><br/>The premise, as we are lead to believe, is simple, as a group of strangers are all stranded at a rural hotel after a storm blocks the road ways and exits.   Reading like a new age cast of Gilligan's Island, we have the movie star (Rebecca DeMornay), the Cop (Ray Liotta), the Chauffer (John Cusack), the married couple (John C. McGinley and Leila Kenzle), the convict (Jake Busey), the arguing newlyweds (Clea DuVall and William Lee Scott),  and the prostitute (Amanda Peet).  Throw in a mysterious man running the hotel and a child that doesn't want to talk, and we have the recipe for what turns out to be a murderous rampage.<br/><br/>Giving away nothing that isn't in the overblown trailers, the strangers start showing up dead each one more grizzly than the last.  To add to the suspense, each dead body comes with its own hotel key which counts down the murders starting from ten.<br/><br/>Everyone in the cast seems to do the best with what they have to work with, but we don't really get to know any of the characters too well.  John Cusack's character reveals that he was once a police officer that lost his edge, but all other characters remain mysterious and therefore each a suspect in each new murder.  <br/><br/>Along the way, there is a confusing back drop of a psychologist, played admirably by Alfred Molina, who is trying to convince a panel suits that a man they are putting to death in 24 hours is mentally unstable and should be sent to an institution rather than the electric chair (`His body killed those people, not his mind').   We jump back and forth between these discussions and the hotel and in the end, we learn of their connection.<br/><br/>Identity, is one of those rare films where the last act is actually better than the its predecessors.  As each member gets killed off without surprise (why in horror films do people find themselves running somewhere alone when they know there is strength in numbers?), we are left bored and tiresome. It's nothing we haven't seen before.  However, James Mangold then relates the story back to the convicted killer, and that is when you sit up, straighten your collar, and understand both the motivations and the outcomes of each of the strangers.<br/><br/>Identity is a good film if for nothing else that it boldly tries something new and even the most clever of audiences probably didn't have the ending figured out.  Where it loses marks is in its cardboard writing and its typical ending which leaves enough room for a sequel while giving thriller fans one last jolt.  Cheap.<br/><br/>I recommend Identity.  All involved have done better work, but there is no doubt it is popcorn fare, and no doubt, you will be talking about the ending after the lights come up."

","When the ending credits started rolling for Identity, I was ready to jump on here and start raving like a lunatic about how good this movie was. But my Internet is down and I'm writing this in ""Notepad"". I'm watching the deleted scenes as I write this and I'm thinking about the movie as a whole and a part that didn't work for me, and pretty much took away from the perfection that I had once thought this movie was. I'll ignore the part that did that and write the review not thinking about it, and then come back to it later.<br/><br/>On the DVD there are two movies you can watch. Theatrical and Extended. I watched the Extended.<br/><br/>This movie would have made Hitchcock proud. (I know that is what is being said about ""Out Of Time"" but it works here) This is a thriller that would mess with even the sanest, laid back person and freak him out. It's so hard to explain what I just got done watching without giving anything away. You will <b>not</b> know who the killer is. That is a fact.<br/><br/>
The characters are all perfect and all needed to create this scenario of strangers in need of each other to get through a troubling situation. There is a reason why they are all perfect and made for this situation, and to figure this out you need to watch the movie, cause I'm not telling you.<br/><br/>There are clues all over the place for the audience, but they don't go to anything in particular. Your left thinking this for 15 min and then something else pops up leading to something else. The final clue still doesn't help. The truth has to be shoved in your face and WOW, is it ever shoved! BAM! This is the truth! BAM! Never after ""Memento"" have I seen a thriller as complex as this one. If you can name one I would love to hear it.<br/><br/>I recommend this for couples needing something to talk about and just anyone needing some suspense in their lives.<br/><br/>I gave it a 4 out of 5<br/><br/>
Now the 15 seconds that made me mad... It's at the end and was a part that could have been completely different. One of the characters finds something at the end and they way they found it was just horrible. There could have been a different way to find it and  it would have made the ending 50 times better. If you have seen it you will know what I'm talking about."

","This film is based around the concept of when people have a connection, in this case the date of birth of the people involved.

","Suspicion, depression, and despair, what a goddamn raining night with such a horrible motel it is! Characters are described step by step as the plot goes on, and the end gives me so many surprise. Identity somehow use the movie technique of Momento, several lines go to a final destination to describe a story, but it is more reasonable in reasoning. From the beginning, I suspect that the cop himself is the criminal, but I never thought about the mean actor of the movie, a former cop who is so tough and calm in such a situation could be one of the character ,or we say fiction of that psycho, less to think that boy could be the final cold blooded killer! Yes, he is, the final scene told us everything and every answers to those painstaking riddles.<br/><br/>Every character in this movie performs well. Different characteristic and the basic responding to the tough situation. The camera is also good and if it not mimic Momento, I would give it a much higher score, anyway, this film could be a must-see in 2003"

","This is the kind of movie that makes you want to guess what will happen next, and I was happy to be wrong. The surprises and smart script were just what I wanted to see.<br/><br/>In the beginning of the film, the director displys a techinique of showing something happen by snapping back to how this person or this object got there. This gets us right into the story where we want to be. A very very rainy night gets us in the atmosphere for the chilling events that are about to occur. One event leads to another and a flooding of all surrounding roads forces a group of strangers (all with an unknown connection) to end up meeting in a run-down motel in the middle of the storming desert of Nevada. A sequence of murders begin to take place. Although the sequence doesn't only seem to be coinciding with room numbers, it's easy to feel out what characters will stay and what ones will quickly find their fate with a room key mysteriously nearby. The key seems to have no purpose, but it helps to show that not all of the deaths were accidents. The film keeps you guessing who the killer is. And you never get it right, not even til the very end. (And I must say the ending was quite creepy!) However when they reveal what you think is the big twist about 3/4 through the movie you think ""why did they just ruin it""? But still wanting to see who the killer is will get you to the ending. Performances met their expectations. Jake Busey and Ray Liotta delivered chilling performances. Amanda Peet and John Hawkes were quite realistic. And despite the fact that we learn John Cusack isn't who he seems he remains a leading man whose story we wish to follow. In fact the connection between Amanda Peet (Paris) and John Cusack (Ed) is evident and makes the viewer hope for development of a relationship. This chilling, smart film is a good flick to get for a rainy night. And I have to say it was even more creepy for me when I relaized that poem stanza repeated throughout the movie was actually something I had read earlier that day. Scary! Rent this movie for a good scare, it's not too much of a screaming stuff popping out at you horror flick, but it's definetly worth the watch."

I guessed it a few minutes before they actually spilled it. and at first I thought it was too early in the story but I was pleased to find I was wrong, in my opinion. the reviewer in the main page gives a little crap to Cusak about being ""haggard"" but I think that's exactly how he was supposed to look. And as far as telling his life story, it seemed to mesh perfectly with the timing of the film. That said, this is a creepy creepy movie. Lot of shocks but not a bloody kind of film that some movies overdo to make up for the lack of suspense. This movie kept me guessing the whole time.

Many users have complained about the plot twist in this film. Not about the first plot twist which introduces the last third of the movie but about the final twist. Obviously, these people didn't like the ending because it was not happy!!! The moment they relaxed and believed that things had turned out well they were forced to see that the ""killer personality"" hadn't been defeated and that more murders would happen - also in reality.<br/><br/>Oh dear, what an awful ending in a horror thriller!?!?<br/><br/>I am utterly unable to understand how anyone could have a problem with this kind of ending. First of all, an evil-eyed kid attacking a woman in a beautiful landscape with a rake is clearly meant ironically, which means that a too-serious approach to this ending reveals a lack of humour in the critic. Irony is, in my opinion, an excellent answer to the recent inflation of ""mental-plot-twist"" movies.<br/><br/>Second, what the **** do people expect of a horror film where people are stabbed with baseball bats and where audiences are supposed to be screaming out loud at the revelation of a dead body? People who do not like to see dark or evil things in movies should have left to see Bambi ten minutes after the film began, shouldn't they?<br/><br/>So, for me this is a fantastic conceptual thriller, very well acted, moody, scary, suspenseful - and highly intelligent."

And I was not let down, because this movie takes you through the mind of a schizo and the movie is cut in such a way that you only learn this step by step, only to be revealed at the very end what is going on and who did all the killing. And when that moment comes you actually witness an aha-erlebnis, trust me.

","I'll warn you right now, I'm telling the whole story, so if you don't want to know the ending, the twist and the inside details, then don't read this!!!<br/><br/>I normally don't tell the whole story like this, but this movie is such a psychological mind game that I have total respect for it, and feel the need to share.<br/><br/>Malcolm Rivers has been convicted of six murders. They show you the details and give you the basic information via news clippings and the like in the very beginning of the movie during the opening credits, so pay attention. He is clinically insane, and only twenty-four hours from his execution. The governor's office has granted him a last minute hearing by a judge who is none too happy to have been called out of bed in the middle of the night to hear a case upon which he has already ruled.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the cast of characters is introduced. It is pouring down rain, the phones are down, a prisoner in transport has escaped and a woman lies dying in the room off the motel office. There is friction from the very beginning, as one character causes an accident while another character runs over the wife of yet another character. And this is only the beginning.<br/><br/>As the characters develop, you begin to get a feel for who they are and what they have been through; the development is really quite good.<br/><br/>One by one, the motel visitors are found dead and one by one, your list of suspects begins to narrow.<br/><br/>Jake Busey (the escaped prisoner) runs and runs away from the hotel, but when he spies a structure lying off in the distance, he crashes in to discover he's BACK at the hotel! A metaphor for John Lennon's ""Nothing is Real"" theory. Jack Busey is really very good. They don't give him near enough work, in my opinion. He's every bit as good as his daddy.<br/><br/>The survivors must determine the common factor which has led them all to the hotel. Amanda Peet begins this process, and it takes a while before the others join in. Meanwhile, they are trying as hard as they can to determine what is happening and why; who is killing these people off.<br/><br/>As the guests realize that they all have the same birth day, you pan to Malcolm Rivers's hearing where you discover that he is a multiple personality with several distinct personalities.<br/><br/>His personalities ARE the guests of the hotel. As each personality is exposed to Rivers's base identity, the alternate personality is ""murdered"" in his own mind. <br/><br/>The whole movie is a working metaphor for what is going on in Malcolm's mind. This part is presented as a ""twist,"" and it definitely takes you by surprise.<br/><br/>The writing and direction are absolutely brilliant. Awesomely presented and believably portrayed by all involved. This is a genuine work of art.<br/><br/>But as everything seems to be winding down and the sidewalks are rolling up, you discover that the personality who committed the murders has indeed NOT been ""killed."" <br/><br/>You don't discover until the end of the movie, what is going on or why. It was possibly one of the best psychological thrillers I have ever seen. It rates up there with ""The Game,"" and ""Fallen.""<br/><br/>I can't bring myself to tell you which personality is the murderer. But it will blow you away! This was a total masterpiece of psychology, horror and suspense.<br/><br/>I give it an 8.6/10 from...<br/><br/>The Fiend :."

You can read on in confidence if you have not seen this movie. I would first like to comment on the story itself. You will hear people refer to ""twists"". I happen to be very sick of ""twist"" endings because they are overused and filmmakers these days rely immensely on ""twists"" to yield drama or reaction from audience. They tend to abandon the rest of the plot and the storyline and focus purely on this reaction. Well, this annoying trend leads most of movie audiences losing interest in movies in general because if you are like me, you'll feel that most of these movies are predictable and lose much of their impact. Oh yeah, almost forgot to mention that 90% of action, mystery, horror, or thrillers are in some way (mildly or even blatantly), a ripoff of another story. Identity however, is unusually original. It also has a very strong storyline which was not compromised for cheap thrills. The thrilling sequences in this film are very solid and are backed up by a great storyline. I give it 8.5/10.

 Sadly however the movies title is a bit of a give away and didn't make the task of working out one of the movies plot twists very hard.The fact as well that all ten people are somehow linked made part of the outcome a bit obvious.That said however the second twist does take you by surprise and would certainly demand a second viewing just so you could get all those clues that you missed the first time around.<br/><br/> The end result is an above average thriller that is not with out it's faults.Let's be honest.There's been far worse thriller's than this that have been made in the past.You need only look at the likes of the dull 'Primal Fear' and the predictable,lame dud that was 'Sliver'.Trust me if you want a good nights entertainment I would suggest this.It's not perfect but you won't be totally disappointed.<br/><br/>Robs Rating: * * * *"

This movie will keep you thinking and keep you guessing.  There are many well-known actors in this movie and surprises at every turn.  Once the puzzle pieces start falling in place, I guarantee you will say ""Wow!"" because this movie is just a constant roller coaster that never ends. I highly suggest to anyone thinking of seeing this movie to watch it.  The movie is done in a good way where it makes you think, but you don't have to watch it 10 times to understand what happened.  In addition, the DVD has another version of the movie with an alternate ending.  I haven't check that out yet, but either way it is a treat."

","*****POSSIBLE SPOILER(S)*******<br/><br/><br/><br/>Identity was a film that I wanted to see when it came out in theaters but never got the chance. When it hit the dollar theater in my town, I still didn't get around to seeing it and I had to rent it for $4. I think I would've enjoyed it a bit more had I only paid a dollar to see it. In the end, the only saving graces of it were John Cusack and Amanda Peet. The movie started out well, but the last half was predictable (c'mon, the kid is the last one to go into the mother's bedroom? that was the point where the movie started going downhill) and the ""twist"" was not a twist at all if you had been paying any attention to the film. The movie was too short and should've been at least another 20 minutes. The whole cast did a really good job though - I thought it was kinda funny how three of the members were or are on shows on ""Must See TV"" on NBC (the guy from Good Morning, Miami, the Scrubs guy, and the friend from Mad About You) and I didn't really realize it was Rebecca DeMornay until the last few minutes of her performance but thought the irony of her role was pretty funny, too. This movie was more a pyschological thriller than a slasher thriller. It had the occasional ""jumpy parts"" but ultimatly, you were spending more time trying to figure the movie out in your head (for those of you who haven't seen the movie, you'll know what I'm talking about) than you were covering your eyes. If they had really wanted to, they could've easily made this movie PG-13 - the violence wasn't that gory, it was more just the ""after"" picture of it and the only other thing they would've had to change was the language - too much use of the 'f' word. But had they had done that, the movie wouldn't have been the movie that it was and I'm glad that they made it this way. I mean, if you were isolated with nine other strangers in a crummy motel in the middle of a thunderstorm and one by one people were gettting offed, would you really say ""oh, dang it, I should've stayed home""? All in all, the movie had the right blend of violence/suspense and could've turned out to be something more, but really was just, well, Identity."
"bodhisattva13","9","0","0","11 September 2003"," Highly inventive film
","""Identity"" is a well-crafted film and a wonderful addition to the genre. When the film came out in April, I avoided it because I associated director James Mangold with such films as ""Kate and Leopold"" and ""Girl Interrupted."" So it was a surprise to find a fine psychological thriller in the Hitchcockian tradition. There are a lot of twists, turn and red herrings. In the Starz! feature on the DVD, John Cusak says that the characters are moved around as if on a chessboard, which is true. It's one of the best films of 2003. Cusak and Ray Liotta are fantastic; the former has that dark, intellectual stuff down while the latter is the dark, dangerous explosive type. I love them both and it's great to see such cinematic heavyweights working together. If you skipped this one out, rent it. Better yet get the DVD and take in some of the extras."

","As you watch this film you can see Hitchcock's influence throughout. On whole the film does a good job on recreating the suspense and thrills of early Hitchcock films. The relative small amount of gore was a pleasant surprise considering its gratuitous use in thrillers today. The look and feel of this movie is classic, however the ending is just plain disappointing. The final 30 minutes seems rushed should have been fleshed out more. SPOILER FOLLOWS: Once the viewer comes to the realization that the entire movie up to this point has been a fantastic therapy session in the mind of a schizophrenic killer, the unbelievable parts of the story are not as irritating. The problem is the film does not take its time and allow the viewer to understand that none of what they have been watching is real. Thoughtful cinematography could have made a better distinction between reality and fantasy after it was reveled that this was happening in the killer's fractured mind. But there is really no excuse for not allowing the doctor to realize that there was one more personality alive before the killer dispatches him in the van. Enjoy the look and feel of this movie but be prepared for an ending that just doesn't live up to the rest of the movie."

","This review is all spoilers, so if you haven't seen it, skip my comment. Sorry Ted, it was the kid, not Ginny. I had other people trying to convince me it was her, but those arguments made absolutely no sense. Watch the DVD with the director's commentary. The big twist at the end wasn't much of a twist. I guess that's why some people invented their own twists and claimed it was Ginny. I think the movie would have been better had it been her, but no one asked me my opinion. It was the kid and it was very clearly spelled out at the end. Otherwise, great performances all around and an ""A"" for effort. The movie may have fallen apart, but it is a solid psychological thriller for the first hour. Unfortunately, the movie took a cue from slasher flicks and pulled the ""bodies suddenly disappearing"" trick, which I found really annoying. It would have been nice if the script had undergone another rewrite and been about 30 minutes longer, preferably with more character development in the beginning. Also, it would have been nice if there had been enough clues for the audience to figure out who was doing the killing. The ending was a cheat. It's worth a look for the cast alone: John Cusack, Ray Liotta, Clea DuVall, and several other recognizable actors. If you have nothing better to do, give this movie a try."

","While not the best movie ever made, Identity will keep you guessing until the end just what is going on.  Fairly quickly you will deduce not all is as it seems.  As more details are presented, the idea of a supernatural cause becomes more and more realistic; yet, at no point does the movie seem supernatural.<br/><br/>Is this a slasher movie?  In the classic sense, yes.  There are murders. There is blood.  There is a knife, a bat, a gun, even an exploding car. But in the end, the hows of the murders are unimportant.<br/><br/>The best hint to give to understand this movie is simple: pay close attention to all the details and make no assumptions.  Upon recollection of all the details, it becomes VERY obvious what is going on.<br/><br/>Kudos for keeping the suspense going and allowing the audience to make their own minds over what happens.

"blaisepascal","8","0","0","6 September 2003"," A smart thriller that challenges the viewer
","As tempting as it is to give spoilers, I assure that there will be none in this mini-review. This is mostly because I want to do my best to persuade people who haven't seen this movie to ignore the simple minded criticisms I've read all too often. This movie begins in a predictable, yet very well done thriller/murder mystery type vein. Everything that can go wrong, does go wrong. The acting and script and direction all lay out an extremely solid groundwork. The only problem with this is that this genre has been done many times over and would be difficult to make any impact in.<br/><br/>And so the movie decides to take a very original and interesting approach as it progresses. As things unfold, it will at times leave the viewer questioning what they understand and how much of what they understand they're even sure of in the first place. Eventually when the viewer finally gets a grasp on things, the realization sets in of just how ambitious and well done this movie is. Believe me, I haven't even given you a HINT of the roller coaster this movie takes you on.<br/><br/>Because it hits you with so much though, I suggest the close minded and slow witted do not watch Identity. Most of the criticisms of this film result from such viewers, who are left clawing to hold on to the predictable (and entertaining) foundation the beginning of the movie lays, leaving them with a stinging bitter taste in their mouths as they are sent hurtling into the depths of the abyss that is Identity.<br/><br/>The script and directing are phenomenal. They are what make the movie. The acting is all well done, but nothing really stands out because of the nature of the film. With an adequate cast, which Identity surely has, the script and direction take over and tell a story that easily can win over the viewer on their own merits. This brings out Identity's only real flaw though: because of the script's nature, there is only so much this movie can do. I can't say any more than that without planting the seeds of spoilers. Basically, the writer of this movie had to make a sacrifice. It was obviously a great story. But because of how it has to progress in order to be great, it prevents itself from ever taking that next step into the realm of classics.<br/><br/>Perhaps with an extra half hour or forty five minutes Identity could have worked enough character development and pathos in to make it last with the viewer forever. But more likely than not, I suspect, it would have only served to drag out the movie. By making it to-the-point and hard hitting, the makers of Identity bite the bullet and settle for birthing one of the best movies of 2003, instead of one of the best movies of all time.<br/><br/>And this, I think, is a respectable decision. A decision that more than warrants that you watch this outstanding movie."

","It's nearly impossible to review James Mangold's latest film, IDENTITY, without revealing the plot twist that makes this very enjoyable thriller 'work'...and since the director chose not to reveal it, himself, until the film was nearly over, I'll respect his vision, and not give it away!<br/><br/>Two story lines unfold; in one, psychiatrist Alfred Molina has a final session with convicted serial killer Pruitt Taylor Vince, before execution. Despite the defense claiming insanity, the court ruled against it, and the bitterness towards the murderer, and satisfaction the prosecution feels about justice being served are clearly evident, making Molina's task a nearly impossible one.<br/><br/>In the other, a chain of events strands a group of motorists together at a seedy motel, run by John Hawkes (who is excellent as the sleazy manager) during a storm. Composed of a hooker (Amanda Peet), who, with a lost shoe, began the chain; a nerdish husband (John C. McGinley), his wife, seriously injured after being struck by a car, and his stepson; the chauffeur (John Cusack) who struck the woman, and his passenger, a fading movie star (Rebecca DeMornay, who is nearly unrecognizable); a bickering young couple (Clea DuVall and William Lee Scott); and a marshal, transporting a killer (Ray Liotta and Jake Busey). With the roads flooded and phone lines down, the group is isolated...then, in a fashion similar to Agatha Christie's TEN LITTLE INDIANS, people begin to die! It becomes a race against time to discover who the murderer is...<br/><br/>The two story lines intertwine in a very surprising manner, making IDENTITY far superior to the 'by-the-numbers' gore-fests that pass themselves off as 'suspense', with the climactic twist a stunning revelation that is VERY effective!<br/><br/>If you like your films challenging, you're in for a treat...IDENTITY delivers!"

"Victor Field","Null","0","0","15 August 2003"," Comes close to being as clever as it thinks it is.
","At one point in ""Identity,"" Clea DuVall points out the situation's similarity to Agatha Christie's ""Ten Little Indians"" (though she doesn't actually mention the work by name), though no one can really call this movie a homage to the Jessica Fletcher ancestor. James Mangold's movie is the sort that works best if you don't know too much about it going in, so apart from the basic setup of a group of people finding themselves stuck in a motel in the middle of nowhere during a dark and stormy night, you won't get too much about the plot here.<br/><br/>""Identity"" certainly has a lot going for it - the plotline is intriguing, the movie is a return to a good old-fashioned murder mystery, and the director's got a good cast to play with; if you put John Cusack as a limo driver, Ray Liotta as a cop, Amanda Peet as a lady of the night, John C. McGinley as a stepfather, Jake Busey as a convicted murderer being transported to a hearing, Alfred Molina as a psychiatrist and the ever-lovely Rebecca DeMornay as a diva-ish actress in the same movie, you're unlikely to get a load of bad acting, and you don't. Alan Silvestri's effectively disorienting score and some real jolts help the movie's 90-minute running time move along efficiently as well.<br/><br/>BUT...<br/><br/>The movie's major plot twist is a problem - I won't give it away here, but if I could suss it out before it's revealed, then I can't be the only one to be a few steps ahead of writer Michael Cooney; his tendency to wrongfoot the audience, though it works more often than not, leads him to try and garnish the tale with red herrings... and he makes the mistake of trying to go for one twist too many at the end. Again, I won't reveal it here, but Chucky said it best in ""Child's Play 3"" (or was it 2?) - ""Aw, man, you gotta be f***ing kidding me!"" The more you think about it, the less sense it (and indeed various other plot points) makes. <br/><br/>It's still worth seeing, and getting Amanda Peet into something decent is never a bad thing, but ""Identity"" could have been a real gem instead of a flawed but diverting little thriller. And I admit to be miffed that the first person to be killed was... no, I'm not giving THAT away either."
"ChRiS-803","9","0","0","6 August 2003"," A throwback to the good old days of thrillers
","I have always been a sucker for a good thriller, a film that keeps you guessing, throws in red herrings, steers you in the wrong direction and gives you an ending you just didn't see coming. Identity' may seem like a standard old slasher thriller and ultimately it is, there's nothing remotely revolutionary, most of it borrows from past ideas and its pretty clichéd but that's the irony of the film. How do you explain the casting of Ray Liotta (Unlawful Entry') and Rebecca De Mornay (The Hand that Rocks the Cradle') who both played menacing terrorisers in the 90's and are now on the opposite end of the knife. <br/><br/>It's a stormy night in the middle of nowhere and a family have stopped to fix a punctured tyre. As the father (John C. McGinley) is changing the tyre, his wife (Leila Kenzle) is struck by a limo. With the wife gravely ill, the limo driver (John Cusack) attempts to get help and takes the family to a nearby motel. The torrential rainstorm also forces several other disparate people to seek shelter in the motel. Included are a young newlywed couple (Clea DuVall and William Lee Scott); a faded actress (Rebecca De Mornay) who was being driven by the limo driver; a prostitute (Amanda Peet) and a cop (Ray Liotta) transporting a killer (Jake Busey). Meanwhile the motel is run by a creepy manager (John Hawkes) who isnt all that he seems.  The rain doesn't let up and the 10 strangers are one by one murdered. Who's the killer? Naturally the killer is the first suspect or is it the creepy motel manager? Could it be a ghost since the motel was built on an ancient burial ground? As the murders intensify, the remaining guests begin to find a connection to the murders. Meanwhile the film intercepts with an eleventh hour hearing for a man (Pruitt Taylor Vince) who is convicted of several murders and is about to be put to death. Is there a connection?<br/><br/>James Mangold hasn't really demonstrated his as good of a director as he is for attracting good casts and he usually has more talent than he can utilise with his past films including the star studded Girl Interrupted' and Copland'.  In Identity', again he doesn't use his cast to the greatest effect (De Mornay is doomed pretty early on), but with such an ensemble cast, there isnt the need for any stand out performances because with more characters standing out than others, it puts the film off balance. Everybody is a suspect, nobody is immune, which is very important in figuring out the film because it doesn't go for the easy answer, it makes you think. This all leads to one of those trick endings, which makes you relive the entire film and put it all together. Some may not think it works, but it grabs you and also makes you kick yourself for falling for the detours and tricks the film has in hiding its secret. Its ending is the first conclusion that fooled me since The Sixth Sense' and Fight Club' from 1999. <br/><br/>Mangold though has a nice visual style and though clichéd, the brutal rainstorm is a necessity for a good thriller, it has an ominous effect that works well here. The motel setting is creepy yet authentic and again there's nothing terribly insightful here, but a standard setting with some killings. The industry has evolved that most thrillers rely on shock tactics to scare audiences, but Identity' doesn't have any gruesome scenes or outrageous deaths, it's relying on a terrifying and menacing script to creep the audience out and make them think like a good old whodunit. None of the cast are overly great, though Amanda Peet continues to prove herself a great actress while John Cusack and Ray Liotta may be photocopying past performances but they're still good. <br/><br/>Identity' is a good old thriller that deceives the audience, plays with their mind by giving them detours that go nowhere and requires them to try and piece together the mystery; before ultimately giving them an ending they probably would have never guessed. Its these type of films that make the thriller genre one of the best and we like to play detective and its good to get a good old scare and Identity' is an effective way to exercise our sleuthing capabilities. <br/><br/>My rating: 8 ½ / 10"

Cop Ray Liotta teams up with ex-cop turned Limo driver John Cusack to try and find the killer.  A fairly good cast consisting of up-and-comers and a couple of stars past their heyday, the film is genuinely engrossing. You start to notice many things at the start that get you thinking, such as Ray Liotta's uncanningly bad police work, which is all important to the film.  There is the cliche'd reference to an indian burial ground, and as the film moves on we start to cut to a doctor's meeting happening far away while the night of horror takes place.  Here a Hannibal Lecter-like entrance from a mental patient gives the audience more food for thought.  Other weird occurrances occur.  For example,  a convict Ray Liotta is watching escapes, only to mysteriously end up back where he started, much to his confusion. At this point you are thinking there must be a whopper of an explanation for all of this, and the excitement is rising.  Which is why, you are left unfortunately disappointed.   Just as things are getting interesting,  the mood changes and a twist occurs that you don't quite expect.  It is an intelligent twist, albeit a disappointing one. This is the reason you may have heard critics say the film would have run perfectly well without it. At this point things start to click, and the title of the film seems more clear than ever. You then return to the action with a completely different perspective, and ultimately the excitement has gone. Despite this, the ending is not that bad, and what was a spooky horror movie becomes more disturbing and thought-provoking.  There are good performances from most of the cast, and the end product is a much better movie than recent hyped-up disappointments such as Jeepers Creepers or Ghost Ship. 7/10"

","I really liked this movie. I actually read the reviews about this movie before I went to see the movie, so I knew what I was getting into. Since the tickets were a $1.50 a pop, I wasn't gonna shed many tears had the film turned out to be as bad as the critics on this board have labeled it. To me, this film was a case of ""damned if you do and damned if you don't."" Don't know what I mean? Well... several folks in their reviews above have pompously stated that the first hour of the film was great and the last hour, unfortunately, wasn't so great. Well, if that was the case, then the first half of the movie was shaping up to be yet another movie based on the premise of a shadowy Jason Vorhees stalking unsuspecting victims with a... how original... a knife. Don't get me wrong, the first half of this movie - based on this premise - was done extremely well. To me, it was the latter half of the film that saved it - made the movie so innovative, in a genre that is desperately lacking originality these days. However, had the movie turned out to be nothing more than a sophisticated slasher film, than no doubt these same ""critics"" would have howled and whined and moaned about how ""unoriginal"" this film was, how it was retreading where other movies have walked before it. So, in the end, ""Identity"" can't really win. By changing or ""pulling out the rug"" to stay original, the movie is blasted. Yet, had it stayed true to its roots shown in the first hour of the film, it would have been labeled as a ""tiresome retread"" or ""unoriginal.""<br/><br/>So in the end, don't listen to this ""would-be, wanna-be critics."" This is a great film with a neat twist. It's not about a lunatic on the loose with a knife. It's not about (gag!) vengeful Native American spirits or aliens from the Pleades. It's a great movie with great twists and great character development that won't leave you disappointed. <br/><br/>My only criticism is the last 2 minutes of the film. The movie would have been perfect had it ended with the ""triumphant personality"" driving off to Florida and enjoying those acres of oranges. Somewhere in the ""Hollywood rulebook"" it states that a horror movie *must* have a shocking, evil ending. Why? It WOULD be innovative to have a movie of this type ending happily, with good triumphing over evil. You know, it's been so long ago since a horror movie ended happily that such an ending now would again seem refreshing and... wow!... shocking. <br/><br/>Other than the appearance of the missing child in the end, a great movie. 9/10."

","Hitchcock, Stephen King and the usual suspects must have crossed director Mangolds mind during the planning and production of this excellent movie. Chilly and very surprising indeed. Really a puzzle you are almost forced to try to solve while watching, in between the goose-pimples and silent screams of horror. John Cusack, Ray Liotta and all the rest of the cast deliver excellent performances in a classic one-set, blind-alley, dark and wet location (as seen in several movies from 'Key Largo' and onwards).It's a cool thrill on a hot summers day.

","I went in with no expectations, never having heard of this movie. I guess from the comments thats the best way.<br/><br/>I was expecting a simple killer thriller once it started.<br/><br/>The way the transport was tied in with the convict arriving at the motel was clever, and the mid plot twist was fab and such a surprise. I don't mind clues being omitted to heighten the surprise (but I hate it when details are added, clues are always too simple and spoil everything).<br/><br/>Once the twist was added, the story was obvious, but pleasantly so. I was a bit surprised when our hero then appeared back at the motel to fight his demons.<br/><br/>The very ending was a classic hollywood ploy for an ending that still remained pleasing.

","ALL MY REVIEWS CONTAIN SPOILERS.  EVERY ONE OF THEM.<br/><br/>
Identity is a rug snatcher.  This is a phrase I made up but will soon lose credit for now that it's been made public.  Anyway, it defines a movie that deliberately tries to snatch the rug out from under your feet, just for the sake of messing with your head.  Just when you think you know the movie, A-ha!  SNATCH!  It isn't what it seems, is it, silly audience member? Boy, are we Hollywood writers smart!!<br/><br/>This technique was done well with The Usual Suspects, but since then, it has erupted into almost a Hollywood tradition.  The Sixth Sense, The Game, Planet of the Apes, Fight Club, Wild Things, The Others, and now Identity are all rug snatchers.  A Nightmare on Elm Street 6 was also a rug snatcher, because who would have ever thought Freddy would have actually died?<br/><br/>Identity is also stupid.  One of my strict movie rules I follow:  Never trust a movie that begins on a dark and stormy night.  The film is about 10 strangers who all meet up to spend the night in a motel and end up getting bumped off one by one.  A woman is hit by a car and is hurt badly through most of the movie.  Her husband and weirdo son tend to her wounds.  John Cusack plays a limo driver who used to be a cop.  And Rebecca DeMornay, who has been visiting the tasty cakes section too often, plays a snobby ex movie star.  I can't believe this is the same woman who played the hot hooker in Risky Business.  I think she alone is the reason this film is called Identity.  Try to guess who she is.<br/><br/>Anyway, the film starts off well.  The characters are introduced in a fairly original way and the tension builds to a great premise.  Then...A-ha! SNATCH!  The writers give up and snatch the rug from under us and flips our whole world upside down.  The movie gives us a twist on top of the original twist, because once we learn the 10 characters are all the same guy (from Natural Born Killers) we then have to figure out which fake personality did all the fake killing.  Like we even care at this point.  I mean, it's all fake.  The movie even cheats in this aspect, because they purposely leave out huge details and clues to prevent the audience from trying to figure things out.  Well, isn't that the definition of a mystery?  Figuring out clues?  God, I hate a stupid movie.<br/><br/>I had good intentions for Identity because its writer, Michael Cooney, also wrote a brilliant movie called Jack Frost.  No, not the happy Michael Keaton version.  I'm talking about the REAL Jack Frost-- the original.  The one that was snubbed at the Oscars.  The one about a killer snowman who terrorizes a small down with his big teeth and deadly ice cycles that shoot like bullets.<br/><br/>But now, he's gone from genius to commercial and brings us this crap on a stick called Identity.  Movies that start off well and end crappy piss me off more than movies that are crappy from jump.  At least the 100% crappy movies don't lie and mislead us.  But the ones that start well build our anticipation with false hope.  That's like the Prom Queen inviting you to her bedroom...to read Tolstoy.<br/><br/>* out of 5."

","With the all-famous scenario of a group of strangers brought together by a struggle, and the horrors that rise upon them as one by one, they mysteriously end up dead. We the audience, are once again brought into the world of spine chilling fun but this time from director `James Mangold' who previously helmed drama piece `Girl, Interrupted'. Our director is covering new territory this year, with a body of Hitchcock ready to bring us all into this thoroughly enjoyable piece of cinema. `Identity' sees a group of strangers both with there own unique character spirit stranded in a motel on a rainy evening. With no where to go and no one to help them, the group find themselves being stalked by someone or something with the intentions of putting them all to rest before they can even realize who dunnit? The film follows as an almost classic stalker/slasher flick that never fails to deliver the excitement.<br/><br/>This is achieved by the clever twist and unpredictable events that bestow as soon as one believes to have figured out the film. The cast more than delivers what is required from a genre that is almost put to rest itself due to lousy attempts to revive it. But then again this film is not one of these attempts; it's a psychological thriller that helms all unpredictability in the body of a worn out story that has been revived relentlessly over the years. John Cusack delivers one of his most daring performances to date, by dabbling in the field and crossing new territory to something you never thought he could pull off. He's bold and always a pleasure to watch.<br/><br/>Ray Liotta's portrayal is nothing except what you expect, he's been marked as the aggressive tough guy for his recent roles and it's getting difficult for him to play anything else. Amanda Peet makes a smart move as the character who is almost out dated with predictability, but her cunning attempt to make it all interesting is simply a grinning joy to watch. I enjoyed the directors plot to delve into a genre he seems to know nothing about, and clearly a little ignorance can be a good aspect. I just can't help but think after watching such a treat, if the directing could have been bettered by a crusader who wanted to make a psychological thriller with a slasher genre touch, than a man trying to make a tale of murder with a psychological twist.<br/><br/>Nice overall twist's that are guaranteed to make every smart movie watcher's head spin, but simply lacking the vengeance that makes all good psychological thrillers stand back in pride for re-inventing the way all great films are made."

I have to say that I hadn't seen a film that gripped me to the screen so compulsively for its whole running time for quite a long time.<br/><br/>The film starts with a load of strangers ending up at a Motel in a storm after a pretty nasty accident.  Each charachter seems to hold their own stereotype, the hooker, the strange geeky man, the boy who hasn't talked since his father died etc and this may force people into thinking that the film is merely standard horror fare.  But that's the point, that's what the director wants you to think, and this makes the ending all the more twisted. Everything comes together in the end, which of course, i won't ruin for you as the journey until the nerve-jangling climax puts you through more twists and turns that a rollercoaster.<br/><br/>Don't at any point in the film (until the end) try to convince yourself that you know exactly what is going on, because you won't, and you won't until the end.<br/><br/>Overall, a ramming good snog of a film and i really recommend it to those who like their films nasty, creepy and a bit more on the intellectual side of things, a real first class movie.<br/><br/>Oh and you get to see the hooker in her bra, which is nice."
"ih007b2077","Null","0","0","21 June 2003"," So close to having one...
","This is the kind of film you could easily praise highly or slag off just as easily. It's that kind of movie. All the reviews show this. That's, in effect, what probably (!) puts it in the first category for me. So close to having one...is something people who have seen the movie will 'get' but I'm not going to throw in spoilers by explaining what I mean. You'll have to watch it to find out for yourself. The movie is atmospheric yet somewhat predictable. But it's also run-of-the-mill, yet surprising! I know, doesn't make any sense. For British viewers, the catchphrase of 'Blankety Blank' was 'the clue is in the question'. Say no more. I didn't wholly like it because I am not a huge fan of Ray Liotta, who I feel is over-rated. And I was upset because one of my blonde heroines, Rebecca DeMornay, wasn't blonde; but, those points aside,I do recommend it, especially if you know very little about it in advance. On the plus side, I thought John Cusack was excellent, and Amanda Peet extremely, shall we say, 'watchable'. This is not a horror movie as such. Nor was 'The Ring' but that doesn't mean that they're not creepy. This is not as good as 'The Ring' which was mind-blowingly terrifying, thanks, mainly, to the magnificent Naomi Watts, but 'Identity' has enough going for it to demand attention. It's got mine twice so far, and I feel a third trip could be just around the corner. For those looking for simple twists like that of 'The Sixth Sense', then this is not really for them. I disagree with many other reviewers who claim that this twist appears too early in the movie. A movie is greater than its twist alone, and sometimes a late twist is as unsatisfying as an early one. I would have preferred 'The Others' a whole lot more if the plot had developed a bit more after its revelation right at the death, if you'll pardon the pun. 'Identity'...so close to having one...go see it...even if  RDM isn't blonde..."

","Well.... If you expect something along the lines of 'Urban Legends' or 'I know what you did last Summer', then you'll be disappointed, because they are crap, equally, if you want something with as good a plot and twist as 'Usual Suspects', you will be closer to the mark, but not as good. The storyline doesn't explain itself at all until late in the film, so if you want a narrative that will carry you along with the plot - tough. It does grip you so that you want to know why 10 (maybe spoiler - ooops 11 people.......) are stranded at a motel, and are being killed off one by one. Don't listen to these people that say it is paper thin/weak as they wouldn't be impressed by anything. Once you know why they are there, you still want to know what will happen.

","Well acted, fast paced and avoiding most of the usual cliches, 'Identity' is an above-average horror film. Good to see Ray Liotta and John Cusack together but with such a good cast, the film would have been much better if played as a straight thriller. As it is, you just know there is going to be a twist in the story and probably a 'surprise' ending (both right). The explanation for the murders is barely credible and basically makes a nonsense of the whole film.But still a good effort."

However, half way through the movie you will realize that there is more to it then just an Agatha Christie's plot.

"boondocksaint20","8","0","0","12 June 2003"," Effective and enjoyable thriller that unfortunately left me slightly disapointed, rather than satisfied towards the end
","I will say that Identity, as a thriller, works.  It is one of the few horror films, like The Ring, to have come out recently that is unique, and ultimately terrifying at times.  As practically everyone has commented on, there is a wonderful ensemble cast in this picture, and practically every character is unique and entertaining to watch.  The film's atmosphere is very creepy and well done...definitely one of the film's assets is the constant rain storm and darkness outside.  The film is multilayered, like your favorite Tarantino outing, and is interwoven pretty good throughout most of the film.<br/><br/>Now, if you read my one line summary, you saw that I said that it is also slightly disapointing, well, I'm getting to that.  The film does score marks on a bunch of plot twists, some of which were unpredictable, others were predictable in the sense that you knew something was off, but didn't know what.  I will also say that the use of the film's MANY red herrings really threw me off for a change...most movies I have seen that attempt to do this, fail miserably.  So, after hearing all of this, you'd think that this is a<br/><br/>really good movie overall...don't get me wrong, it is definitely good, enjoyable, and exciting.  However, my disapointment comes from one of the plot twists towards the end.<br/><br/>***MINOR SPOILERS (Don't worry, nothing major is given away)***<br/><br/>
Though the film is multilayered, this is also one of its downfalls.  From the get go, we hear a recording of a psychiatrist talking to someone who has murdered 6 people in an apartment.  I won't say what, but what was said on the recording gives WAY too much away...this did not detract from my enjoying the first hour of the film, but I was disapointed in that I knew from the first few frames a little too much information about the killer. And, my BIGGEST complaint is the unraveling of the film's main plot twist a whole 20 minutes or so before the flim's ending...I won't say what it is, but once you see what it is, and ultimately, realize what is going on, you suddenly won't care at all for the safety of the remaining people at the motel, their fight to survive suddenly becomes a means to and end.  I'll admit, it was a good twist, but to me, it totally killed the suspense and mystery for the remainder of the film.  The rest of the film, though well done, however, I felt was disapointing after knowing exactly what 'Identity' means as the film's title, and the reality of the situation way too early on.  If the filmmakers hadn't revealed the premonition of one of the characters so early, it would have been a lot more suspenseful.  Then again, with the way the ending was written, perhaps that was the only way to have filmed it...at any rate, I will say that I liked the very very last twist at the end, it totally had me surprised...though not as shocked as I would have liked to be, considering my interest investment in the film had died 20 minutes earlier, it is still unexpected.<br/><br/>***END OF MINOR SPOILERS***<br/><br/>All in all, not a bad movie.  I'm not sure if it's one worthy of multiple viewings, but definitely one of the better horror movies of recent years. It has great acting, creepy atmosphere, and a good plot to keep it running...but don't let my disapointments turn you off from seeing it, as I've read on the message boards, people have reacted very differently to this movie.  That's my 2 cents.  8/10 stars."

","Those involved in the making of this dark-and-stormy-night thriller, whether they were behind the cameras or in front of them, should not freely boast about their accomplishments.

There is way too much rain and lightning going on here, and my patience quickly wore thin.<br/><br/>Eventually, though, you'll come to realize you could have made the entire film with complete strangers to both big and little 'screens', and saved a bundle on having to pay for the likes of Rebecca DeMornay, Jake Busey, Ray Liotta and, egads, the abyssmally talented John Cusack (I would've preferred to see his sister Joan do something much more interesting with this movie).<br/><br/>You'll also recognize second-raters like those supporting actors that appear on television's ""Mad About You"" and ""Scrubs.""<br/><br/>""Identity"" has been compared to Agatha Christies seminal book/play ""Ten Little Indians"" (AKA ""And Then There Were None""), yet I found myself hoping the ten characters in this 2003 update would hurry up and 'leave.'<br/><br/>Take some sound advice: stay home from this one."
"driffma","9","0","0","28 May 2003"," It lost me in the last act
","Identity begins with the stranding of ten people at an out of the way motel on a dark and stormy night.  The phones at the motel are out and the roads are washed out. The guests at this motel are, a family on vacation, a limo driver and his famous actress charge, a prostitute leaving Las Vegas, a couple just married, a federal marshal with a convicted serial killer in tow, and the clerk at the desk.  Did I mention that it is a dark and stormy night.  Well Constant Reader, you probably already realize that this is a sure prescription for disaster.  Soon after the guests are settled in, they start getting killed off, one, by one. 	The first hour of this movie follows the formula adopted by many a slasher/mystery.  We suspect along with the characters that one of the stranded guests is committing the murders.  We have two investigators on this case, the limo driver Ed (John Cusack) and the Federal Marshall Rhodes (Ray Liotta).  Considerable tension mounts among the guests as they all begin to suspect each other.  And while it is all stuff we have seen before it is entirely compelling because it is so well done.  The fodder in most thrillers is typically uninteresting and when the killer does visit them we care not a whit.  In this film though all of the characters are extremely well drawn.  This is essential as this film basically starts out as an exercise in genre filmmaking.  These characters are intelligently written, they don't seem typical, in any way of the mystery/thriller genre.  We get a sense of the lives they have lived before they all come together in an out of the way motel in a driving storm.   While we don't see or hear much about those lives we get a hint of what they have been like before the moment we meet them in the film.<br/><br/>	I liked everything about this first hour and twenty minutes or so. No let me make a stronger statement.  I loved the first hour and twenty minutes of this movie.  I especially liked the limo driver Ed.  John Cusack's limo driver is something out of a 1940's hard-boiled crime drama, not Sam Spade, but closer to Philip Marlow.  He is a nice guy, who has seen much, and most of what he has seen has not been good.  He is a limo driver, but he hasn't always been one.  I think you will guess what he did before the chauffer gig long before it gets revealed, and if you don't you will say oh, of course. And what is neat is every one is good in this film, every part is good. There isn't a throw away role in the film. For me that is the damnable misery of it.<br/><br/>	In this day and age you cannot make an eerie mystery without a major twist or two.  That is not necessarily a bad thing.  I like surprises, I bet you do too, and there is a big surprise in Identity.  I can't tell you what it is of course.  I can tell you that I absolutely hated it.  That the twist is well done is not in dispute.  Is it interesting?  That is something you will have to decide for yourself.  For me it ruined everything I had come to think about the characters.  The climax becomes just a matter of tying up loose ends.  I no longer cared how it ended, who lived or who died, with the big twist all that stuff just ceased to matter.  <br/><br/>	I walked out disappointed.  But I can't say the movie is bad at all.  It is well crafted, and engaging.  And it may be engaging to you Constant Reader, even after the twist.  In a genre that is typically filled with mindless trash, Identity makes an effort to be an engaging thriller, it doesn't do it with cheap thrills or lots of special effects.  It depends instead on thoughtful direction, engaging script, and excellent acting and a lot of rain. I give the movie a 9"

","Identity is the kind of movie that leaves you scratching your head trying to figure out what you just saw.  It contains so many plot twists, that it will make your head spin.  However, it is not a bad movie by any means.  It either took a real genius to come up with this story or a total wacko, I can't seem to figure out which.<br/><br/>The very begining of the film gives you the feeling of ""Final Destination"" and then suddenly switches to the Norman Bates Psycho mode.  Some bizarre killings begin to take place and of course as most horror and mystery stories do the characters try and pin the killings on each other.<br/><br/>
The film doesn't get extremely confusing til the very end where you can't figure out what actually happened and if anything did at all. The overall conclusion makes you feel cheated in a way and sort of let down because the writer couldn't think of anything better or maybe it is truely a fantastic ending and his intelligence is far beyond the average person's.<br/><br/>Who knows? 7/10"
"darkcarrington","Null","0","0","27 May 2003"," A Cliche Horror Movie
","Spoilers Herein.<br/><br/>
As the title of this review indicates, this is a very cliche horror movie. Almost every possible horror movie stereotype is used.  From the unexpected identity of the killer, to the sequential (and numbered) killings of all of the people, to everyone having something in common (a birthday), this movie covers just about all of them.<br/><br/>Firstly, one of the main short comings of the movie, was the hectic nature in which it switched from killing to killing, and then back to the plot, and then to an unforseen plot twist, and then back to killing.  One of the worst of these is when they all discover that they were born on the same day. They are just sitting in the room, having had another person brutally massacred minutes earlier, and then they randomly come up with the idea that they have something in common.  Having been in the same situation myself, I would first think about either<br/><br/>1) Oh *@#* I am going to die, or 2) How the @#* do I get out of here?<br/><br/>Anyway, the acting is good at times and bad at times.  Ray Liotta is truly genious at most things that he does.  From Shoeless Joe Jackson to this felon dressing like a cop, he does a good job of portraying things.<br/><br/>At the end of the movie we find out that none of this ever happened, and that it was all a guy with schizophrenia, and blah, blah, blah, more cliche stuff and then we arrive at the actual ending.  Somewhere in the middle of the movie, someone says a line from a poem ""I saw a man who wasn't there"" etc.  At the time this is said, it became so blatantly obvious to me, almost like a premonition, that this was going to be the end of the movie, I did not feel that I had to watch the end of the movie.  I did though, and sure enough, a twist ending with the line closing the movie.<br/><br/>Despite the fallicies of this movie, it is still enjoyable for those who enjoy horror movies and such.  If not you can laugh at how incredibly cliche it is.<br/><br/>Rating: 3.5 out of 5"

","""Identity"" was one that I had really looked forward to seeing.  It looked like a good old-fashioned horror/murder-mystery with a sparkling cast and a perfect backdrop (seedy motel, stormy night) I was in awe after seeing the teaser-trailer once and I knew this was one that I HAD to see.  Well, I finally got around to seeing Identity and was it all I hoped for? Well....<br/><br/>Overall, I had a good time with Identity.  I adored the set-up, with the first hour bringing the ten-strangers together and making it all seem like it was fate.  This movie has NO dull moments whatsoever in its 90 minute running time.  From the opening frame, we are given a few pieces of the puzzle, and as time goes on, there are more pieces scattered here and there as we frantically try to put it all together and make sense of the whole thing.  For the first hour or so, I was having the time of my life.  The mood was perfect, the direction was brilliant, the performances were taught (gotta love John Cusack and Ray Liotta) and I just didn't want it to end. However, when the time came for the killer to be revealed, I felt let down. I don't know if dissapointment would be the right word for it, but after investing the whole movie with these characters, I wanted more of them, and above-all a better explanation.  For those who haven't seen it, I won't spoil it.  You may even like it.  I, however, am indifferent about it.  I didn't dislike it, but I wasn't totally satisfied either.<br/><br/>As I mentioned earlier, this movie has a cast to die for (no pun intended) and everyone came through.  John Cusack was totally three dimensional as the ex-cop turned chaffeur and Ray Liotta was outstanding (as always) as the cop who's transporting the convicted killer.  The underrated Jake Busey did what he could with an underwritten role as the aforementioned killer (please, lets get this guy some more parts) , but John Hawkes was a major standout as the hotel ""owner"" with a great sense of humor.  If this movie had any comedy relief, this guy was it.  I love Clea Duvall and I was a little disappointed that she wasn't given more to do than cry and act scared.  The big surprise for me was Amanda Peet.  I've never been a fan in the past, but here she was exceptional as the hooker with a conscience. <br/><br/>7/10"

","I went and saw this movie for two reasons - one the advertising campaign for this movie really did a good job of selling it as a rich atmospheric thriller and two, the great cast - especially John Cusack who is one of those guys that I could always find myself relating to in his movies - my generations every guy.  I found it to be a real good psychological thriller - and though the director pulled the rug out from under you a few times when you looked back at everything - it all makes sense.  You can complain about some things being predictable or convenient, but to see a movie that was scarier for what you heard but did not see instead of just filling the screen with gore was definitely welcome.  Worth seeing and though it may not be ""SUPER"" scary, it is much scarier than ""13 Ghosts"", ""Ghost Ship"" and the majority of your recent scary movies and with a lot more class and style to boot..."

I was starting to think that it was because I had become desensitized. Now I realize it's because movie makers weren't doing it right. A truly intense movie, Identity takes you through the dark tunnels of fear and humanity's twisted side. The plot twists will keep you guessing, but not so much so that you end up lost. Ultimately, everything makes sense, even if it upsets you. This is the thriller movie at its finest."

There were several clues and twists and turns that were pretty easy to spot, but other twists that were surprising to me.<br/><br/>I think in a film like this my guide was Ginny who has some hints of sixth sense esp ability (she senses evil when Rhodes pulls up which totally tips that plot twist) and she makes the key reference (10 Little Indians [lets you know that there is a common connection between the characters and also gives you a key [pardon the pun] hint about the final twist]).  Of course she is not quite psychic enough to save herself.<br/><br/>The move's pacing was good and quick while still slowing in a couple of places where the tension was high.  The overall idea was a neat way to create this creepy motel scene.  And the acting was pretty good.  Overall I'd give this movie a B, 7.4/10."

","I'm a big fan of ""scary movies,"" but never really get scared in any of them. So I didn't think this was scary, but neither did the friends I went with who are scared of scary movies.  It's definitely intense in the theater, but don't expect to have nightmares or freak out if you're sleeping alone that night. With that said, despite the fact that it wasn't scary, I thought it was a great movie!  I love original story lines, and this was one that I'd never seen before.  The twist is completely unpredictable, but I think it's good to not always know what's going to happen.  I was totally surprised by The Sixth Sense and The Usual Suspects, but I think I liked those movies better because they weren't your typical ""'good' guy's going to win because everybody likes a happy, predictable ending"" kind of movie.  I suppose if you go into this movie thinking you're going to figure everything out from subtle clues, you're probably going to come out disappointed.

","Alright. We all love curiousity in a movie, right? Maybe we don't like the term, or the concept or maybe the word itself because of conditional reasons but we al feel good while watching a movie if it makes you feel curious. So, here's an entertainment for all of those who watch movies. You will not be bored and you will have some good time. But. With SPOILERS included to exemplify. This movie lacks ""meta-logic"". Inside, it depends on psychological reasons and outside it's unacceptable. Unlike the Matrix which sets up perfect metacognition around the story-making us ask questions on the reality of the reality, Identity spoils the logic in itself. How many of those who watched the movie, really know if the Doctor really exists or not? Although the scarred personality of Eleven-people-in-a-body decides to kill the Doctor at the end of the end, can't that also be a just his imagination? If yes, what? If no, what? I have read the story of ten little niggers-And then there were none and it was a brilliant one which the movie openly and with gratitude  accepts as its starting point or as its source of inspiration. But why did they need to add the psychology of a madman whose madness is questioned. Although the movie plays heavily on the story, with the fiveminuteflashbacks, the real things to be remembered are made forgotten by the movie which ends in both positive and negative reactions from the vidience. Positively, you keep forgetting your own guess which was possibly true for the sake of the new truth brought before your eyes which you accept as true info since that's the latest news in movie. e.g. Most should accept that they forgot about the possibility of the kid when they saw that Ed was brought in front of the Doctor and lawyers and the judge. Negatively, the movie lost track of the truth for the sake of the twists which may mean only one thing: This is a movie which tries to fool the fool to get recognition. SO American and so Americanishly reinforcing for consuming. If you liked the movie, it's no problem. If you hated it for my reasons, that means you are alert and you are not fooled by the rubbish which repeats itself because it makes people feel good that way. I am sorry to go far beyond the watched and the heard. But this is how things work. You make people seek the thrill of stupid reasoning because it makes a stupid movie an entertainment that way. Then you donot even need to realise that people lose their philosophy. This movie is bad. I will not add particular comments on the cast which were actually very very good.

","If I hadn't seen the trailer for ""Identity"" I probably would have had more of an open mind for the various screenwriting hijinks that crop up in it. Someone said this movie is like the ""Twilight Zone"" TV series, which seems apt.  I always used to enjoy ""Twilight Zone,"" but the key to that was KNOWING that's what I was watching.  The trailer for ""Identity"" suggested it would be a quirky little modern variation on those kill-'m-one-by-one classics like ""The List of Adrian Messenger"" with the killer possibly involved with ""identity theft,"" certainly a hot-button issue nowadays. And for a while ""Identity"" is enjoyable on just such a level.<br/><br/>Various characters are driving in the remote Nevada desert when a thunderstorm and ensuing mishaps force them together into the umpteenth Norman-Batesian movie motel.  (I think Mr. Hitchcock did an entire industry rather a disservice.  I've spent many nights in motels and have never been murdered nor do I know anyone who has been, and the proprietors have always seemed pretty nice, especially this one middle-aged Indian lady with gorgeous braided hair.)  The phone lines seem to be down and it goes without saying that no one has a functioning cell phone, so they're stuck there together.  Events play out in a refreshingly non-linear fashion somewhat reminiscent of David Lynch.  Every character seems just a little off-center with something to hide.  Small quick moments pique our interest: John Cusack as a limousine driver furtively pulls out a gun; Amanda Peet as a prostitute opens her bag revealing wads of cash; Ray Liotta as a corrections officer puts on a shirt with a suspicious hole in the back, etc.  It was nice not knowing an hour in advance where everything was going.  In short I was ""buying into"" the proceedings, enjoying the ride.   But then we get the Rod Serling stuff  (a guy flees the motel and winds up back there, etc.) and talk of Indian burial grounds, making me groaningly wonder if we were steaming into ""Blair Witch"" waters.  Then we get the bombshell....<br/><br/>
SPOILERS ***** SPOILERS *****  SPOILERS *******<br/><br/>
It turns out none of this is really happening.  It all takes place inside the mind of a convicted murderer.  This was so frustrating as to tempt me to walk out on a movie for the first time in years.  Never mind the dubious psychological underpinnings about ""multiple personalities"" and all that. Dramatically the movie simply cuts it's own throat.  It negates whatever interest we had invested in the previous or the subsequent proceedings. Everything that happens afterward seems ridiculous--the shoot-out between Cusack and Liotta, the escape of Peet, the orange grove, etc.  It's all just a stunt.  Lickety-split we're supposed to give a crap about the big bald-headed lug and his state of mind as the crux of the movie.  At least<br/><br/>""The Cell"" gave us a foundation for the fandango into the mind of a psycho killer.  ""Identity"" just springs it on us out of the blue.  How many damn ""Sixth Sense"" knock-offs do we need?  After ""The Life of David Gale"" and ""Basic"" and others and now this, frankly I'm tired of having my cinematic emotional investments toyed with so flippantly.  I think we need a new rating: T for Twist, or SPT for Stupid Pointless Twist.  Director James Mangold has a reputation for being grounded in reality and it was mostly due to that quality that I enjoyed his previous ""Cop Land.""  I think he should go back to writing his own scripts.<br/><br/>
Making it even more frustrating is seeing such good acting all around get wasted.  Everybody shines here.  Cusack is genuinely creepy yet sympathetic, confirming the promise I saw in ""Grosse Pointe Blank.""  Liotta (also in ""Cop Land"") has been down this road before but always makes it seem fresh. (Please, if you see ""Narc"" on video, rent it; Liotta's awesome in it.) Peet gives what should be a star-making performance.  Hell, she made me enjoy ""Saving Silverman"" against all my expectations.  There's even an unrecognizable Rebecca de Mornay in a gloriously trashy cameo as a John Waters-type leading lady.  Yet they all have to play second fiddle to the bald guy with three names who gets thrust upon us as the focus of our concerns.  Hey, call me a Dennis Miller acolyte but you know what, if a guy kills a bunch of people, I don't really care what's inside his head, I don't care which ""self"" did it.  Kill the body, that pretty much covers it.<br/><br/>""Identity"" begins and ends with that goofy little doggerel about meeting a man who wasn't there, and wishing he'd go away.  Not since ""Jeepers Creepers"" has there been such a lame pop-culture reference.  Give me any time the jump-rope ditty from ""Nightmare on Elm Street"":  ""One two, Freddie's coming for you; three four, better close the door..."""
"WilliamCutting","Null","0","0","3 May 2003"," Think before you speak
","Spoilers inside:<br/><br/>I decided to comment on this because I disagreed with a lot of what was being said about this film. It is somewhat of a slasher movie although not even close to a Friday the 13th installment. My main problem with the movie is that at the end it fell into formula and cliche which may very well have been the studio and/or test audiences. The problem with it being a slasher movie is that as far as slasher movies today go this would be very tame. There is a disembodied head found but that's about the most gruesome it gets. I put the spoiler warning at the front of this b/c if you're going to talk about MPD (multiple personality disorder) and this movie a spoiler warning should be there. Many complain all over the place about how cliche MPD is as a plot device in these kinds of movies. Yeah, it is, and I agree that it's also overused but this movie does do something different with it and I will explain. This guy doesn't just have MPD and then that supposedly makes the movie cool because we see all of his personalities slowly but surely emerge. We meet his personalities first, as if they are actual people, and then we see him. Later, the two are associated together. What's interesting about this movie is that it takes you inside the mind of a person with MPD. How accurate it is I'm really not sure, what I do know about MPD leads me to believe that for someone not knowing they have the disorder, this would be very close. In this case MPD wasn't used as a cop-out like it normally is, the disorder is the movie. In my opinion the best actors survive the longest at the hotel but I won't give away who they are. There was a cop-out in the movie but it wasn't the MPD it was the ending revelation of the killer which was cliche and stupid. On the whole, however I really enjoyed the movie and think it is getting a somewhat bad wrap on the whole. I think it's worth seeing. 7/10"

","Identity was a pretty good movie runied by a predictable ending. The film reminded of Lifeboat but with a scarier atompshere. The film in my opinion really didn't have any jump out of your seat moments. John Cuscack and Ray Lioltta are in top form as always and Amanda Peet looks yummy as always. My only other compliant with the film was that Jake Busey had such a small part. Still it's James Mangold best film since copland and worth a look."
"Beast-5","Null","0","0","3 May 2003"," My favorite kind of movie
","I saw IDENTITY the second day it was out,with a theatre full of people. Of course,there was one couple who brought their obstreporous kid,but they got out of there. Of course,they absorbed our death stares first, because this kid screamed like a banshee in need of Ritalin. Natural selection is just a theory,because those idiots would have been<br/><br/>weeded out long ago.<br/><br/>IDENTITY is one of those movies where things lie under the surface of reality...I think IDENTITY could become one of my favorite movies. It's wonderfully written, ominous, and truly scary. The filmmakers set out to tell you a story and tell it well. IDENTITY is 90 minutes of gleeful nastiness populated by people who have serious personal problems. The cast is wonderful,including Pruitt Taylor Vince, John Cusack, Jake Busey, and the invaluable John C. McGinley. I feel it's destined to become a classic. As for the ending...well,I thought it ruled. It was ridiculous, but it was wonderful. ""Whores don't GET a second chance!"""

","Warning:  minor spoiler ahead.<br/><br/>Alfred Hitchcock could tell a good psychological story and what you didn't see was more scary than what you did see.  'Identity' is like 'Jaws 2'.  You saw too much of the shark in the latter film mentioned and the thrills wore off early.  'Identity' has too much gore and too much detachment from what makes a good stoy memorable and for one, I felt cheated to be watching a movie that was primarily set inside one man's head.  It would have been better to have the psychotic (Pruitt Taylor Vince) as the main character and work in a better stoy line.  Ray Liotta and John Cusack are above the platform of fantasy characters who don't exist and deserve better than this. Director James Mangold has a few brief moments of terror but this is essentially a slasher film with shallow results.  If this review sounds weird, it's a direct interpretation of the film.  So go and see it to understand things better.  Just don't blame me if you're disappointed."

","***This review contains MANY spoilers--please be wary!***<br/><br/>""Identity"" is an extremely well-crafted journey through the mind of a killer. And, aside from a few real-world plot problems, succeeds in just about everything it sets out to accomplish.<br/><br/>In the film, 10 people find themselves trapped by the weather in a roadside motel in Nevada. During the night, they become the targets of a systematic, brutal murderer. They also begin to realize they have more in common than they ever imagined.<br/><br/>What leaps out first about this film is the atmosphere it creates: gritty and foreboding, generating a sense of urgency and claustrophobia. In addition, the filmmakers take some bold avenues of exposition in the beginning--such as freeze-frames, contextual flashbacks, etc. Original techniques are employed to make what appears to be a slasher film seem fresh and compelling--deaths are shocking and hard to predict in nature, music is minimally used, character's reactions are used heavily to relay the brutality of the deaths rather than simply seeing the dead bodies, etc.<br/><br/>Acting is top-notch. One would be hard pressed to find one weak performance in the lot. As stated later, each character performs well in the setting of the motel, as well as an element of one man's personality.<br/><br/>The film beings in the vain of a ""slasher"" film, including several requisite ""bait and switch"" plot elements--not the least of which is making the audience believe the killer at the motel is the escaped convict (Jake Busey). Another is fooling viewers into thinking Ray Liotta's character is actually a police officer. Though these are respectful attempts at deception, one can't help but think they seem a little too easy to spot early on.  But, that's the whole point--they're supposed to be easy to spot, because that's not the real mystery here.<br/><br/>About halfway through the movie, the director starts to hint at some kind of ""other worldly"" force at work when Jake Busey finds himself running to a structure a quarter mile away from the motel--only to find himself right across the street from where he just came from. This is where the film really starts to take off--and elements that will eventually explain the denoument start to arrive in bundles: A frozen corpse is discovered that strikingly resembles the killer on trial whom we learned about during the opening credits (Malcom Rivers, Played by Pruitt Taylor Vince);  Each character discovers they share the same birthday; Victim's bodies begin to disappear with no trace whatsoever; John Cusack's character discovers each person seems to have a name based on a state or city.... and this is when it all snaps into place.<br/><br/>Once it becomes apparent that this meeting of people is actually a meeting of personalities in the mind of Malcom Rivers, the movie takes on a whole new level of meaning--and plot elements and characters can be analyzed for what they are:<br/><br/>representations of what caused this 9 year-old abandoned child to later become a murderer. Each and every plot element of the ""story within the story"" is actually an element of what Malcom Rivers must have experienced when he was abandoned: The story within the story takes place in an empty motel, which is where Malcom was found years ago; Characters eat from the vending machines--not unlike what Malcom may have been forced to do; An Indian burial ground is mentioned and shown--something Malcom most definitely feared during his abandonment. In retrospect, these elements are frequent and quite stunning.<br/><br/>But what's more stunning is how each character represents a singular element of Malcom Rivers personality at the time of the abandonment. The director graphically allows us to see the genesis of each ""personality"" in the story within a story:<br/><br/><ul><li>Paris (Amanda Peet) represents Malcom's perception of his mother as a ""whore"" who went from man to man, and ultimately abandoned her child in the hopes to start her life someplace else--without the burden of Malcom. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Caroline Suzanne (Rebecca De Mornay) is Malcom's perception of his mother as a non- mother--someone only concerned with herself, her appearance, money, and without the least concern for human life. In other words--she is what Malcom saw most as a child.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Ginny's (Clea Duvall) representation is twofold: she is Malcom himself as a child who is scared of the cold, wary of the Indian burial grounds, and cries in fear. But she may also be the side of Malcom's mother who undoubtedly had a relationship not unlike that of Duvall's in the movie: An attempt to first salvage, and then dissolve a marriage with an abusive mate by using a false pregnancy.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>In turn, Joe (William Lee Scott) most definitely represents one or more of the little boy's mother's suitors--abusive and immature, and obviously flirtatious with other women. In other words, the only father figures Malcom ever had.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Larry, the manager (John Hawkes),  represents Malcom as a guilty culprit: hiding things that might embarrass him; creating stories to get him out of trouble; In addition, he's the part of Malcom's personality who bears the guilt of ""killing"" the original, unadulterated personality, before the trauma--someone who ""died"" long ago in that hotel: the body found in the freezer. This frozen body lies dormant, and is the only ""dead"" body that doesn't disappear--Malcom's personality can still be saved and ""resurrected.""</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>George York (John C. McGinley) is Malcom's inner perception of what a father should truly be: caring, forgiving, always following rules and the proper course of action. He looks after his son when his mother cannot; He can fix a flat; He doesn't argue with his wife; He reassures his son throughout the movie.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Alice York (Leila Kenzle) rounds out Malcom's perception of the ""perfect family."" She is attentive, sweet, and has an emotional bond with her son. One can also say she may represent the soft side of the child's mother--something he probably rarely saw, and something that was only shared in private between the two (the hand-touching scene). She has the least to say in the movie, because Malcom rarely saw this side of his own mother.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Timothy (Bret Loehr) represents Malcom's purely emotional side as a 9 year old. He never speaks throughout the film, and is relegated to symbolic emotional expressions only. He first shows love (touching hands with his mother), then fear, then sadness (crying after the death of his parents is complete), and finally anger--which drives him to kill. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Rhodes (Ray Liotta), on the surface, can be interpreted as one of Malcom's mother's many ""male partners"" (hence the flirtation he has with Peete). However, Liotta may also represent the part of Malcom's personality that draws attention away form the real evil (Timothy). In other words, Liotta is an internal ""defense"" created  by Malcom to, oddly enough, protect the discovery of the real culprit among his personalities. In the end, the Liotta character is successful, in as much as he takes the fall for the real ""killer"" inside Malcom's mind.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>That being said, Robert Maine (Jake Busey) is the overt counterpart to Liotta's character. Both he and Liotta serve to distract us--and Malcom--from the real killer personality. Liotta is does it subversively, and Busey does it obviously.</li></ul><br/><br/>-Last but not least is Ed (John Cusack). He represents two elements: First, he is the hero/strong personality Malcom wishes he could be--he solves the crime; he protects his mother (Peet) and saves her from a life of prostitution--giving her a ""second chance"" (in an idealistic life: a farmer in an orange grove... something a child might dream up).<br/><br/>But Cusack also represents Malcom's lifelong, ongoing attempt to wrangle the other personalities into submission--the last remaining shard of reason in Malcom's mind. We see the motel setting through Cusack--he tries to come to grips with every other character, and he's the one who ""discovers"" the link between them in Malcom's subconscious (the map scene). He thinks logically and intelligently--albeit within a fantasy world. Cusack is the character that Malcom identifies with while at the hearing, and he is the one entrusted to root out the ""evil"" personality that killed those people 4 years earlier in the housing project. Tragically, this last remaining shred of reason ultimately fails--leaving Malcom at the end of the movie in complete dementia, and under the control of the only personality remaining--one driven purely by killer emotion.<br/><br/>Which brings us to an interesting conclusion: Malcom Rivers was so far gone in his dementia, and so consumed with revenge and anger--he did not want to be ""saved."" Since we all know dreams and fantasies are controlled by ourselves--and every element is placed there by us (even in our subconscious), we can only assume Malcom actively sabotaged his own efforts to ""find the killer."" In other words--he pulled the most interesting bait and switch of the movie on himself: making his last spark of reason (Cusack) believe the killer was someone else (Busey, then Liotta)--thereby letting the real ""killer"" inside (Timothy), go free--and preside over the mind and body forever.<br/><br/>This journey through the mind of a person with multiple personality disorder is both creative and enlightening: Many movies on this subject simply offer a character with the same disorder and blame it on an abusive father, a mother with no self respect, and childhood abandon. ""Identity"" actually graphically depicts each element as a character/ event in a fantasy, and even goes as far to show the struggle within the mind to regain itself versus the internal attempts to sabotage it's own well being.<br/><br/>
The only thing that keeps this film from being excellent is the flaws it suffers during the ""real world"" elements of the film. A last-minute hearing to stay the execution of a convicted mass murderer is not only unrealistic, but it's justification in the film is unrealistic as well. Apparently, the only thing that saved Malcom Rivers from execution is a journal that was ""just found"" at this late date. Are we to assume that there were no doctors studying this man for the four years he was being held in prison? Was a journal really required to see this man could have plead insanity? Why was this a ""last minute"" decision?<br/><br/>The only explanation for such an odd turn of events is to facilitate the fantasy world of the motel story. In that setting, there is a feeling of urgency and time-sensitivity. The people must survive until dawn;  Malcom Rivers has to find the ""inner evil"" and get rid of it quickly before it takes any more lives, etc. The only explanation for having such an unrealistic ""last minute"" discovery of Malcom's insanity is to maintain the feeling of urgency in the real word as well as the fantasy world. In other words--the film would most definitely lack a certain ""punch"" if the real word events were happening over a period of four years.<br/><br/>All in all, ""Identity"" is a great psychological study. It's technically not a thriller--as the story really is the journey Malcom Rivers must make to rid himself of evil. Once viewers accept it as a creative attempt to dissect multiple personality disorders, ""Identity"" truly shines.<br/><br/>One note of warning: Don't be swayed by reviewers who portray themselves as<br/><br/>extremely intelligent for having ""figured out"" the twist of this film within the first few minutes of viewing it. Their attempts to impress are based on luck, advance<br/><br/>information, and hindsight. Some people feel they have to prove their self-worth by claiming they can deconstruct a movie within minutes of its opening credits-- especially one that requires more thought than they probably have the capacity for. ""Identity"" is not a film that can or should be deconstructed in the first few minutes: It deserves much better."

How everything tied together. IE: Everyone being trapped at a motel due to the actions of the prostitute, the Serial Killers mother being a prostitute who left him in a motel. The little details were leading up to something very interesting. The vibe of the film was excellent (until the twist). The constant down pour, the dirty motel, the coming together of the characters, the unravel of the mystery, the dwindling of the cast, all of these elements were great. The (not too inventive) twist however, just let me not caring. Upon realizing all the characters were just in somebody's head, I didn't care for the characters at all. Its hard to have 'sympathy' for the characters that are just in somebodys head (yes I am aware of how ridiculous that sounds while commenting on a work of fiction :).

","***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** Finially, Finially, Finially. A movie that got my attention and made me watch over again. Now before I continue, this isnt a normal review of this movie. This movie has plenty of them. What I am writting is what this movie means and why nobody fully understands. Ive read the reviews and ive seen people think the murders at the hotel actually happend, ive seen people try to sound smart and figure the plot out and up until this point nobody has. This movie makes you think, ALOT. You can just watch it, go home and think about it for a few and get it. This movie is filled with twist that no other movie has ever done before. If ya didnt like this movie, then please, go back to watchin Rambo movies, or Screams, or Terminator, cause none of those makes you think.<br/><br/>Today, it seems its all about crazy stunts, fast action paced movies, and leave you with nothing to think about. What this movie did was show you that a masterpiece can be made while movies like Basic with huge twist and crappy plots, or Life of David Gale, where they get you, but by the end its done, you know you got tricked it was a huge twist and the movie is over. This movie makes you think and talk. It took me a few hours to figure it out, what this movie really meant, and how this movie was made. Im going to throw discuss three movies I consider classics and why they are. And in turn compare them to this movie.<br/><br/>1)Silence of the Lambs. Awesome movie. This movie was awesome cause it wasnt your average killer will kill, cop will catch him and thats it. Silence of the Lambs introduced a whole new concept. A killer helping a cop catch a killer. It was slow paced. Every step Claurice took, you took with her. You wanted to piece together the clues Hannibal gave before she did. And chances are you didnt and was left sayin DAMN DUH I KNEW THAT. And by the end your mouth was watering for a sequal.<br/><br/>2)Memento. This movie was a classic cause it was backwards to front. Nothing typical about this movie at all. Movies have tried to change it up some, with Pulp Fiction being the most popular. But never has a film tried to do it in total revearse and it work. Well it worked. Total Classic.<br/><br/>
3)Wild Things. Take away the sex scene the smut and everything else and youve got a good movie. Of course the theme of the movie was as simple as can be. Greed. And in this movie greed conquers it all, but it was also with twist and turns and it left you with the feeling of ""damn, now I gotta watch again just to half a55 understand it"". It was filled with a good cast that did an excellent job.<br/><br/>Now back to Identity. In a way Identity had a little bit of all these classics in them. But what Identity conquered what many films failed was it did a complete 180 x 100. Most films in the trailers put the good parts so you go see them. Most films leave out a few twist so you are suprised and leave the theater happy ya spent the 8 bucks. Not this film. This film made ya want to leave the theater not happy cause ya spend 8 bucks, but mad ya didnt do it sooner. Mad cause the DVD isnt out yet to rewatch it over and over and figure out what exactally made this movie so bad or good, or a classic. The movie was a classic on many parts. But below is where I will explain what the movie meant and what it was tryin to show the people who watched it. The below part contains spoilers so dont read unless youve seen the movie.<br/><br/>
This is what this movie meant. A guy. An insane guy who has multiple personalities. If youve ever studied them, you know why this movie was so awesome. When you have multiple personalities, you dont know you have them. But they know about you, and of the other personalites. Confusing in itself, and this is a real disease. So take that and youve got yourself an awesome plot. So anyways, if you listend to the dialouge real carefully you'll know the docter brought out the top 10 personalities. The whole case against the judge was one of the personalites killed the 4 people not him. So if they could prove that, then he goes to the nuthouse instead of being put to death. So what the doc did was come up with an idea. How can we find out what personality it was that killed the 4 people?. So he drugged him and basicially made a movie inside the fat guy head. Now if your confused already, its ok. Put it this way. When a movie is announced they get a bunch of people they want to play a part. For instance. Selena had 10,000 girls plus audition for Selena. Jenifer Lopez won. Same thing here. The fat guy could have had 20, 30, 50, 1000 personalities, who knows. But what the docter did was eliminate them to 10. 10 of the personalities most likely to have committed the crimes. If ya notice during the movie when the two fugitives killed the cop, that cop was a personality. He was just eliminated from the list, thats all. So now youve got ten personalites left. Hotel, the scene where the showdown will occur. One by one the personalities are killed out, leaving less and less for the doctor to presume is the killing personality. When its down to Cusack, Amanda, and the ""Cop"" you think one of those are it. But as you know none of those were the killer. The kid was. The Kid personality tricked the fat guy. The killing personality hid as something nobody would expect it to be. A killer. A kid? no way. So the doctor and the fat guy thinks the killer is the ""cop"" but it isnt. So in the end the kid kills Amanda Peet and the kids personality comes out durning the bus ride where the fat guy kills his doctor and the driver. Awesome twist huh? It went from being an ordinary who done it, to a man who has multiple personalites, to a doctor who has drugged his patient to find out which personality is the killer, to a personality actually tricking the person who carries him. This movie is a top 10 best ever if you understood it. If ya followed what they gave ya. If not, the it would be pretty bad for you. If youve seen it once, see it again. if ya hated it, see it again. if ya still hate it, Im so sorry for you. If ya loved it be sure ya loved it for the right reasons.<br/><br/>Just whatever ya do, give this movie a chance. otherwise your letting a very good movie go to waste."

","When I first read about ""Identity"" on IMDB, and watched the trailer in theatre, I thought it might be a really good movie. The synopsis made me remember the 60's Bollywood movie ""Gumnaam"". ""Gumnaam"" had same plot of 10 people being stranded in Island, and getting killed one after another. It was a real good movie with some excellent music by Shankar Jaikishan<br/><br/>So the synopsis of ""Identity"" felt more like a ""remake"" of ""Gumnaam"". I was thrilled by the thought of seeing a good suspense movie after a long time. And true, the first hour of movie is worth watching for the goosepimples and chills it gives time to time. However, when the curtain is lifted from the suspense, you feel very cheated and angry.<br/><br/>I think Hollywood is churning a seris of psycho-supernatural thrillers . ""Sixth Sense"" started a trend. Then came ""Unbreakable"", ""The Others"", ""Vanilla Sky"", ""Minority Report"", ""Beautiful Mind"" - to name a few. ""Identity"" is a movie that tries to fit itself in this category, but fails miserably. I should have given 6.5/10 rating, but no decimals allowed."

","I highly recommend watching this movie.<br/><br/>This move is a dark, eerie and stimulating roller coaster ride from start to finish, which continues to surprise until the final scene, two seconds before the credits roll.  What makes this movie different than any of the other movies of recent note, is that all the phenomenally acted characters in this movie only exist as the different personalities of a mass murderer - due to be executed in 24 hours.<br/><br/>The portrayals of the different personalities and their extremely complimentary contrasts reinforce the amazing depth of the mass murder's multiple personality disorder.  The visualization of multiple personalities trying to co-exist within a single mind and body, indirectly, gives insight of how challenging it must be to treat such a disorder.  Moreover how a doctor can encounter any level of success when the personalities themselves all have independent wills to live and survive. <br/><br/>At the same time this film, in a possibly unintended way, presents an interesting case for not executing a convicted criminal because he's mentally ill and makes an argument as to whether or not that is the right way to handle things in the very last scene of the movie.  If a discussion about the treatment of mentally ill criminals takes place, after watching this film, you might have to consider that as one possible motive behind this eerie movie.<br/><br/>In a really long stretch, but a possible on, you can draw small similarities to Fight Club, but in this case there isn't just one alternate personality - there are several.  In addition the alternate personalities are more tangible, in terms of how you could see each of the different personalities existing in the real world."

At first the movie seems like it's just a typical thriller and a whodunnit slasher flick. Well, I won't give anything else away, but think again. If you want to see a movie that has a crappy payoff, but like an okay thriller, then this may be for you. Too many twists and turns for no reason other than to say this movie is different. I can't say I recommend this movie. * 1/2 stars out of 4 * stars."

","As I turned the key in my car's ignition, the familiar bass of Queen came tumbling out of my speakers. `Are you ready, Are you ready for this/Are you hanging on the edge of your seat?' How is that for coincidence, I mean, what better song to be playing after watching a bloody flick like `Identity'?<br/><br/>On a rainy night in a place in Nevada that could be quite well described as the Middle of Nowhere, ten perfect strangers all end up in a desert motel. There is the pleasant York family with the father (John McGinley) and son Timothy (Bret Loehr) trying to hold together after a messy accident puts the mother (Leila Kenzle) on death's door. The cause of the accident also shows up at the motel in the form of a pampered actress (Rebecca De Mornay) and her faithful chauffer Ed (John Cusack) being the ones who actually hit Mrs. York.<br/><br/>Then there is the prostitute, Paris (Amanda Peet), who, for some odd reason is detested by the creepy hotel clerk, Larry (John Hawkes). The next set of people is made up of the newlyweds (Clea DuVall and William Lee Scott). The final set of people is the cop (Ray Liotta) with his prisoner escortee (Jake Busey), which makes for a nice combination on a stormy night. Oh, and I must add that in a seemingly unrelated tangent, there is a hearing going on in some California town to decide on a soon-to-be-executed prisoner's aptness to be killed.<br/><br/>As one may expect, people start dying, often in gruesome fashions, which leads in to this nifty bit from the song of the column--`Another one bites the dust/ Another one bites the dust.' Then comes a twist that may or may not blow your mind, but I'll leave that little bit of the mind-twist for y'all to figure out.<br/><br/>This is one creepy film. I don't do horror/suspense well, so I really have nothing to base this off of, but it had me hooked. The first two acts play out nearly perfectly, with the suspense building and building as another character bites the dust. To this, I credit director James Mangold for keeping it moving and also keeping the audience guessing as to which member is the killer.<br/><br/>The third act of the film, though, threw me for a loop. In some ways, it is a very good twist, but in others, the entire pacing of the movie is interrupted and throws the audience off of its guard for a moment or two, which is not exactly a good thing to do.<br/><br/>A couple of stand-out performances-John Cusack is excellent as the closest thing to a `hero' the film provides as he basically walks the audience through the clues. I also give kudos to John Hawkes for his motel clerk who offers the precise amount of patheticness and menace to be intriguing. One other good job goes to Amanda Peet who is solidly spectacular as a flawed semi-heroine.<br/><br/>But as with most large casts, there are a couple performances that left a bit to be desired-for one, Leila Kenzle (this is not that big of a spoiler, so don't protest!) as her character is supposedly lying dead, well, when a dead person is noticeably breathing, that is not that good of a thing. I also did not particularly care for Jake Busey's convict-character because what we did see was just not really enough and a bit more could have been done with him.<br/><br/>`And another one gone, and another one gone/ Another one bites the dust/ Hey, I'm gonna get you too/ Another one bites the dust.' As this review bites the dust, I can conclude that the tension in `Identity' never really bit the dust, as proof, my heart rate was up over normal by nearly 40 BPM right after the film ended, which speaks to the tenseness. I think that `Identity', especially when coupled with an amazing coincidence, is deserving of an 8 out of 10."

","On the one hand, I really liked that this movie twisted the genre a little, that it didn't turn out to be a simple whodunnit. On the other hand, if you're going to use a twist that relies on psychology, you have to ensure that it's logical, clear and all adds up in the end. That way, it's like you're letting the audience in on the joke. This 'twist' was lame for several reasons. I saw it coming twenty minutes in, and it doesn't clearly resolve itself (and I think that totally detracts from it's effectiveness) - remember Usual Suspects and The Sixth Sense? They're examples of logical resolution). On the other hand, John Cusack was great and it was suspenseful for the most part. I just wish it had been written a little better."

","A good movie is one where you think about it the next day and maybe even the entire week.  This is that kind of movie.  I wanted to see this movie before I ever saw a trailer for it and when the trailers did come out, I avoided them like one would avoid the plague. Identity, directed by James Mangold, is about a storm that strands 10 strangers in a seedy motel with no way to leave because of the streets were flooded.  One by one each get killed off.  By who?  Well, I can't say because it is a surprise. The beginning of this film is so excellent. SOME SPOILERS but nothing serious!!! You see how each of the characters actions result in something else happening which ultimately results in going to the motel.  The direction of the first 20 or so mintutes is awesome.  The pieces of the complicated puzzle are so masterfully put together that when the movie is over you see the whole picture.It was kind of confusing and I felt exhausted when it was over but I couldn't stop thinking about it. This is very a la Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho with the motel room and the storm and the whole feel of it felt that Hitchcock had a hand in this film. The cast was awesome.  John Cusack in a role that is different from his others and a welcome change.  Ray Liotta, I think, always has this creepy prescence.  Jake Busey is just one creepy guy that makes the hair on my arm stand on end.  Amanda Peet is showing that she is better than some of the movies she has been in before.  Clea DuVull should never be in another teen movie again.  You can't take your eyes off of John C. McGinley because this role is the opposite of the role he plays in Scrubs and he just has this way about him that is so interesting to watch on screen.  I didn't even realize that was Rebecca DeMornay, which the quote that the motel manager was right on the money about ""Didn't you used to be that actress?""<br/><br/>I missed some things throughout the movie because I was thinking about what was happening which caused me to forget what happened in the very beginning with Alfred Molina's character. I want to see it again. <br/><br/>Grade: A **** Stars"

","Identity is a film that returns to the style that old thrillers had. Starting off with a basic premise, we're able to go into the movie knowing fullheartedly what to expect. Ten strangers get stuck at a motel on a rainy night. After they begin to know more about eachother... they start to get killed off. One by one. John Cusack (High Fidelity, Serendipity) and Ray Liotta (Field of Dreams, Narc) lead this amazing ensemble cast. Also starring are Amanda Peet (The Whole Nine Yards, Changing Lanes), John C. McGinley (Any Given Sunday, The Animal), Clea Duvall (Girl, Interrupted, The Faculty), Rebecca De Mornay (The Con, Feds) and Alfred Molina (Frida, Magnolia).<br/><br/>The coolest thing about this flick is the eerie atmosphere that is created at the motel... during the storm... with these characters. The trailer does a perfect job of catching the mood of the movie, and that alone should attract most moviegoers. The motel in the film, often noted as an obvious reference to The Bates Motel, plays a larger character than any single player in the film. It's the phone booth to Phone Booth, or the panic room to Panic Room. Now, back to the atmosphere. Some movies just know how to suck you into the story. You know, how you often find yourself on the edge of your seat just waiting and waiting for the huge, shocking finale to hit? Identity is the first movie that put me in that position.<br/><br/>I've always been able to piece together clues in movies to predict the ending. Well, not for every movie I see (like The Sixth Sense or The Usual Suspects), but most. The pieces in Identity start to slowly come together, just as they do in any other suspense film, until the final clue is given... and bang! Not everybody will appreciate the ending of the film. Some might argue that it was, for some reason, a cheap way to end the movie. I thought the complete opposite. As the credits began to roll I remember telling myself that, without a doubt, it worked for me. Everything worked for me (besides the often bitchy Amanda Peet).<br/><br/>Other films where the cast is killed off one at a time end up being cheesy-teen-horror-flicks (Final Destination), or horror-flicks-that-are-trying-to-stay-away-from being-teen-horror-flicks (Darkness Falls). Identity does a great job to totally set itself apart from those two genres by setting itself up with a well-crafted plot, exceptional acting and an ending that can't be missed. People who are fans of the old mysteries and thrillers must be sure not to miss this one.<br/><br/>Seven and a half stars / of ten stars. (******* Â½ / **********)"

","This movie has all of the classic horror movie feel with none of the barriers previously placed upon movies of the horror genre. While it can be called predictable by those who watch entirely too many movies, the plot is well deserving of applause. John Cusack once again plays his role stunningly, and has helped this movie into my own High Fidelity-esque top five list of horror movies. Also headlining this movie are more actors that you may have seen in other movies and t.v. shows. Ray Liotta once again plays a great cop role. Amanda Peet plays a strong co-star female role similar to the caliber role of her character in Igby Goes Down, minus the drug problem. Teen movie heroine, Clea DuVall, has a heavy emotional role, and carries it better than even the writer could have predicted. Especially after seeing her in The Faculty. Someone you may not recognize is Rebecca De Mornay, who has finally had her first decent role since Lana in Risky business. Scrubs star, John C. McGinley plays the role of a mild-mannered stepfather; something far from what the famous sitcom's addicts may not have expected him to act as. The character Lou is played by William Lee Scott, who you may know from movies like Pearl Harbor, Gattaca, Gone in 60 Seconds, and October Sky. With so many skilled actors headlining, plus a great plotline that accepts the fact that, although everything under the sun has already been done, it still has an ace up the sleeve enough to keep you interested, keep you jumping, keep you guessing, and keep your light on when you go to sleep."

"mdogg220","Null","0","0","26 April 2003"," Identity Saves Itself by Using Smarts
","When I walked into 'Identity,' I was skeptic. It's been a while since I've seen a clever suspense film that has worked. 'Identity' was just that and nothing more: a clever suspense film that worked.<br/><br/>The movie involves ten strangers stranded at a motel, who start to get killed one by one. Sort of a take on Agatha Christie's ""Ten Little Indians,"" which one of the characters acknowledges in the movie, this movie works because it's a suspenseful whodunit, rather than a mindless gorefest.<br/><br/>
The reasons why the film manages to salvage itself from a potentially ridiculous plot, are the director/writer relationship and the actors. Mangold works well with Cooney, (it doesn't hurt that he worked on the script as well) never belittling the material on page to a mere slasher flick. The scariest moments are the silences and the shadows, rather than countless things jumping out at the characters.<br/><br/>The twist in the movie (which I will not, of course, give away) is believable because the writers use a loophole which leaves no room for question or scrutiny. But mainly, it works because of the performances of the actors, mainly John Cusack and Amanda Peet. Cusack brings to life a complexity and realnees to his character that would have otherwise been cheesy had it been portrayed by a lesser actor. The major connection of these people at the motel seems a bit absurd if told secondhand, or on page; but because the actors believe in their characters, the audience, at the moment, does as well.<br/><br/>I'm still not sure about the ending. It seemed a bit contrived in order to add even more 'shock' value for the audience. But if that's the direction the writer and director decided to go, since the rest of the movie pulled me along up until the end, killing my skepticism along with the characters, I am willing to give it the benefit of the doubt."

Intense from the start, I was glued to the screen from beginning to end.  I thought the writing, acting, and directing were brilliant, and it never had a predictable moment.  Every character is fair game. Not to mention the horrendous thunder storm which rages through most of the film and becomes extremely oppressive and scary due to it's severity.  The script is detailed enough to prompt one to want to see it again to discover something new that might have been missed the first time. The best way I can sum this film up, and this is not easy to do, would be a clever combo of Seven meets Psycho, but scarier and more intense than both.

Also, the way the film began was very cool, from the montage of the psychiatrist and all of the newspaper clippings and the cassette playing in the background, to the way it began with one event, cut back to explain each person's involvement, then began again from the first abrupt scene switch.

Sartre even makes a brief appearance, leading one to hope that this film could give us a meaty existential meditation on the meaning of identity as well a few good scares.<br/><br/>Don't get your hopes up.  _Identity_ does all the work for you, requiring zero thought and even less of an attention span.  I actually found myself making the story more interesting as I watched.  The ending, which is supposed to be a plot twist (though I can't see how your average 12 year old couldn't see it coming a mile away, given the structure of the film) just falls flat and left me with an empty kind of ""Is that all?"" feeling.  I got the feeling that the writer thought he was being original.  Negative on that, sir: see _Lost Highway_, _Mullholland Drive_, and _Passion of Mind_ for better variations on the final twist.<br/><br/>That said, most of the audience did not feel as I did about the film, instead chuckling with amazement as they crooed:<br/><br/>""THAT person was the killer?  How wacky and original?""<br/><br/>[insert sound of me slapping my forehead- HARD]<br/><br/>With all of that in mind, the performances are all really good.  It's nice to see John Cusack getting work.  Ray Liotta does the same role he always does, so you can pretty much take it or leave it.  Alfred Molina once again changes himself completely and leave me wondering what his real accent actually is.<br/><br/>The look and misé en scène of this film was fantastic.  Maybe next time we can have a story.<br/><br/>So, the only way to really enjoy this film is to be too smart for your average Hollywood fare and too obtuse to see the point that the film is trying to make.  I'm sure there are people like that out there, but I don't care to meet them."

","If you like your movies to adhere to stock Hollywood formulas and endings that can be foreseen twenty minutes in to the picture, then ""Identity"" is definitely not a movie for you.  At first, the picture appears to be a somewhat conventional horror movie where unrelated guests stranded at a remote Nevada motel in a driving rainstorm are being systematically killed in gruesome fashion.<br/><br/>Even then, the superb acting carries the film - especially John Cusack as a limo driver trying to do the right thing and Amanda Peet as a world-wise prostitute.  Eventually a parallel and seemingly unrelated story about a convicted killer who is about to be executed unless his lawyer can get him committed to an insane asylum begins to make its connection to the motel felt.<br/><br/>Without giving anything away, it will make your head spin and have you reexamining everything you have seen in order to figure out this brilliant puzzle.

A unique screenplay well acted and shot through its entirety, not to mention one of the most innovative twists in a horror film I have ever seen! Some might think that the revealed killer would make the entire movie lame and preposterous, almost making you want to throw something at the screen, but it must be placed into context of the mind behind the ""killings"".

The twists and turns the movie takes make it a worthy heir to The Usual Suspects or Fight Club.

","When I went to see Identity, I was less than optimistic.  I figured, oh great another slasher film, but this time with star power.  The film seemed to be on auto pilot for the first two acts.  By random strange events, all connected, ten strangers meet at a run down motel, while outside a viscious storm rages causing phone lines to be shut down.  Amongst the players we have a reformed hooker, a newly wed couple, the sleazy motel manager, a cop transporting a prisoner, a limo driver, a washed up hollywood star, and a family of three.  One by one these people start dying.  Naturally our killer is implemented, however as events unfold more and more people become suspect.  Figuring I'd seen this movie about a 1000 times before, I guessed it was the person you least likely suspect, gets revealed as said killer in the final moments and life goes on and I wasted 9$.  However as the third act unfolds the twist came, and I was beyond shocked, I felt had, and yet I also felt a stroke of genius on the film makers behalf, finally a nice third act, where instead of we wait for everyone to die so the movie can end, we are challenged to believe in a rare circumstance, which I will not reveal here.  If you choose to believe in the twist, and not write it off to a cheap hack trick, then you will leave feeling challenged and refreshed, otherwise you'll feel cheated and leave the theatre completely dissapointed. 8/10"

"movieguyangelus","7","0","0","25 April 2003"," A solid cast makes it work.
","John Cusack leads a strong cast in ""Identity,"" a slasher film that has enough twists and turns to satisfy mystery fans, and enough blood and brutal killings for those who enjoy a good old fashioned stalk and slash fest. A group of strangers are forced to take shelter during a thunderstorm in a rundown motel that would give Norman Bates pause. Soon another guest shows up with a variety of sharp objects and a bad disposition. While portions of the film are a bit predictable, there is at least one or two surprises for those who think that they have seen it all. The murder sequences are generally offscreen, but the aftermath is often shown in surprisingly bloody detail....often playing very much like throwbacks to the early ""Friday the 13th"" films. But this cast is hardly your typical teen stalk and slash crew. Cusack is great as usual, in a role that is a big change of pace for him, with some good supporting work from a cast of recognizable faces, all of whom seem right at home in the tense atmosphere. Overall this is a fun horror film that is miles ahead of its current theatrical competition, ""House of 1000 Corpses"" in thrills, gore, talent, and originality."
"ecto216","7","0","0","26 April 2003"," Very intelligent up until the ending
","It's not the easiest thing, to write a review of a psychological thriller without giving away too many important points in the movie. But I'll try to give you an overall idea of what to look for and what's worth your attention in this film.<br/><br/>The main thing I appreciated about this film was the unique way of being able to tell a story. This isn't a solid beginning to end film, it's a bit jumbled up, which adds to the movies excitement (Especially the accident scene) and really keeps your head going at full throttle to understand what you're seeing. It's impossible to not have your head going throughout the movie. With that said, the story and way the director decided to shoot it really helps the film out, and separates it from your usual `Who done it?' façade that most movies in this genre exploit.<br/><br/>Moving on, great cast! John Cusak and Ray Liotta were perfect for their roles. I don't know how happy I was with Amanda Pete, but overall she worked out. The other characters however, fit into a cliché, which was unfortunate. The little boy, the feuding couple, the eccentric husband, even the prisoner Liotta's character is transporting looks like your average comic book creep, which is really a shame considering the sets used in the film were so nice, and there was no need to have these formulaic characters in them. It took away from how creepy the film could have been, and more importantly, ruined the tone during many a scene.<br/><br/>Now what most people are interested in, the plot. The plot is the hardest thing to write about. I'll say this much: This movie has one of the most interesting, original plot twists that I have ever scene. People who have seen `The Usual Suspects' (and who hasn't) will appreciate the way this movie plays itself out. I can't imagine anyone being able to figure out why the events at the motel are happening, and form the correct conclusion on their own. Quite the unique piece of cinematic story telling.<br/><br/>The biggest problem this movie has is not knowing when to stop, specifically the last five minutes of the movie. After digesting what was just dictated to you by the characters in the film, you sit back and think, `wow, that was really something. I was never expecting things to turn out that way.' However, once the ending is laid into place and you recline in the theater seat thinking how smart the movie was, you're treated to a double ending. What you think was true, is not and the true `killer' shows their face. In what has to be the worst idea in psychological thriller history, someone decided to make a certain character responsible for the acts committed that night with the motel murders. What a mistake! What an awful mistake! There was no need for it, it was unnecessary and completely out of place.<br/><br/>
Overall, the movie is smart, but plagued by one of the worst ending in recent history. Even psychological thrillers that I hated, such as `Angel Heart', had better endings than this! Great cast, great sets, great story, but in order to maintain that feeling, you have to walk out before the last two minutes of the film get revealed. Overall, 7 out of 10."

","I went into this film without hearing any reviews as I do with all films. I find it more effective to rate them myself. Anyway, I saw the trailer and the cast looked promising since they'd been involved in other films I enjoyed (ie, High Fidelity, Office Space). I thought it'd be interesting to see these actors in a new setting.<br/><br/>The movie started a little slow, but picked up significantly. It has the elements and potential for a really good film, but the script had a few plot holes and could have used a few more drafts before production began.<br/><br/>
The acting was quite good, the best performances coming from Pruitt Taylor Vince and Alfred Molina. Overall, I would say this is a good film worth seeing in the theater as long as you don't let anyone spoil it for you. My only criticism is that the script needed to be patched up a little more (a few characters technically can't exist) and that this concept is much better suited for a psych-thiller than a slasher flick. Of course you can expect much of anything else from Michael Cooney, the man who brought us such quality films ""Jack Frost"" and ""Jack Frost 2:Revenge of the mutant killer snow man :)"

","I went into this movie with pure excitement. A movie, dark and sinister in look, with an all-star NON-teen cast. How could it go wrong? Fortunately that question was answered with a yell of ""It can't!""<br/><br/>Usually I leave a thriller/slasher flick with a feeling of distaste. It feels too cheap, too ripped off. But the big twist that everyone seems to be talking about...well to be honest it pays off in a huge way. What seems to be more and more goofy as the film goes on, and let me say goofy in this sense isn't unbelievable, just far too coincidental, it all comes across perfectly with the ""twist"". Unpredictable? Maybe. If you aren't paying close attention to the film. About halfway I turned to a friend of mine and guessed what the twist was, and he and I chuckled. It was that far off what is expected. I was right, and it still didn't disappoint me.<br/><br/>
I hate spoilers so I'll avoid them. Trust me folks, this is a movie you will want to see. Read my other reviews if you like, they give a basis for the type of movie I enjoy. If you liked Fight Club, American Psycho, Donnie Darko, or Memento because of a fresh take on an old idea...run to the theater now and see this movie. The acting is a 10 out of 10, the scripting is done well enough to know the characters without revealing so much you're bogged down, the action lets up only at the times that you'll be jumping or biting your nails.

The film started strong as standard horror that had its share of flaws, but other than that, the film was much, much better than most horror films that have come before it. There was a lot of blood, people were dying and I was loving it. I am proud to say that I was able to predict the 'identity' of the killer...sort of.<br/><br/>Y'see, there is a twist towards the end of the movie that made a lot of folks sitting in the theater with me go ""WHAT?"". Luckily, I apparently have a much higher IQ than those people so I was able to follow what was happening. I didn't like it too much. In the end, the whole thing works itself out, but the twist is one I didn't like.<br/><br/>A lot of the story is told in flashbacks. There are quite a few of those and I enjoyed them to a degree. That must be getting quite popular with horror writers nowadays because both RESIDENT EVIL and GHOST SHIP (two other great horror films) have story contained in flashback sequences. The ones in this film are quite important and they are extremely well done.<br/><br/>The film was great. It kept on going and going and going. It never stopped. A strait murder fest. Perfect.

","I found Identity to be an absolutely unbelievable movie. The premise behind the film was maybe one of the most innovative things i've ever seen. On top of this, I didn't even see what was coming..which is a plus. However, despite thoroughly enjoying the movie, I was somewhat disappointed by the ending. It just fed off of a common hollywood cliche that is all too evident the last few years. However, it's not as if the ending was out of left field...it actually made perfect sense. AS long as you pay attention to the opening credits and the judicial review session you'll understand what has happened. If you don't you will be lost. I'd recommend this movie to anyone who wants to see something clever and innovative. Plus, you've got to see the great performances by John C. McGinley, Ray Liotta, John Cusack, John Hawkes (who has always been good), and Amanda Peet."

","Having never really been a fan of the horror genre, upon first hearing of `Identity,' it seemed easy to dismiss. However, it wasn't easy to dismiss the cast: John Cusack, Ray Liotta, Amanda Peet, and Alfred Molina. Although these actors haven't always chosen the best screen stories, they are still respectable and for the most part a good bet when casting for a movie.<br/><br/>After seeing `Identity,' the only conclusion that one could come to was that this film, although grizzly, was not really a horror film. In fact, to call it a horror film is disgraceful considering most horror flicks are just cheap, rehashed slasher movies that are geared for the teenyboppers. What separates `Identity' in terms of scary films is the mystery that surrounds it. An interesting story, and ultimately a mind-bender, `Identity' proves itself to be a very chilling thrill ride. `Identity' tells the story of ten people who are stranded at a motel during a powerful thunderstorm that has flooded most of the roads in the region. However, during their night at the motel, people start dying. Everyone is suspect and everyone is also innocent, as the killer is remote to the strangers. The killings seem to be ritualistic in that whoever the killer is, his or her signature card is a key tag for the rooms of the motel. In other words, as the murderer does the job, he or she counts down with every dead body, starting from ten. The events all lead to an ending that is as shocking as the murders themselves. At first, the film feels reminiscent of Hitchcock's `Psycho,' in that the events take place at a highway motel during a storm. That may have been some of the inspiration of horror screenwriter, Michael Cooney, whose credits include `Jack Frost,' (not to be confused with the Michael Keaton family film), and `Tracks Of A Killer.' James Mangold directed `Identity.' His work includes such films as the 2001 almost romantic comedy, `Kate & Leopold,' which starred the over-used, romantic comedy star Meg Ryan and Hugh Jackman. Mangold also directed the critically successful film, `Girl, Interrupted,' which starred Angelina Jolie and Winona Ryder. His direction here is good and he tries to incorporate a bit of chill in the cinematography by occasionally throwing in a still image to throw the audience off. The technique is not all that impressive but kudos should to be granted for his trying.<br/><br/>One scene in particular was somewhat spooky. The power goes out at the motel and while Liotta's character is outside, he slowly comes around the side of the motel. While lightening flashes and the rain beads off his face, the impression that it gives the audience is that he's doesn't have a chance of surviving the night and he's already dead. Performances in `Identity' were good. Cusack plays Ed, a retired cop, now limousine driver. He, along with supposed cop, Rhodes, played by Liotta, try to take control of the events taking place by continually searching the motel for answers of who the killer is. Peet, the gorgeous actress of such films as `The Whole Nine Yards,' and `Whipped,' plays Paris, a hooker trying to turn her life around. Molina, the star of last year's `Frida,' plays a psychiatrist bent on finding out what happened during the night at the motel. Other stars of the film include John Hawkes (`The Perfect Storm'), John C. McGinley (`Office Space'), Rebecca De Mornay (`Backdraft'), Clea DuVall (`The Faculty'), Jake Busey (`Contact'), and William Lee Scott (`October Sky'). All in all, `Identity' affirms itself as an absorbing show that plays with our fears and with our minds. ***"

","This is a very fun B-movie:  well made, extremely well acted, and with just enough twists and turns to keep one happily unsettled.  **SEMI-SPOILER COMING UP**  Unfortunately, because both the theatrical and television previews show Alfred Molina talking to John Cusack--which, because of the way the film progresses, we know could not happen UNLESS--it was easy to figure out the ""twist"". I hate when commercials do that!  That said, there was still one more creep-out at the very end that I did not see coming at all, and so enjoyed very much. **SEMI-SPOILER OVER**  Identity was very clever, and a movie like this needs cleverness because that is its whole reason for existing, to catch the viewer unawares.  We don't look for depth, or for an answer to the human condition.  We want to be scared and we want to be surprised.  And this movie accomplished both.  A great cast of character actors helps--especially the criminally underrated Amanda Peet, who has been the best reason to see many bad movies in the past.  She is always worth watching, and her tired, retiring hooker here nicely avoids the whole gamut of movie-hooker cliches.  How nice that she can show tenderness and compassion to the other characters without being saddled with the proverbial heart o' gold.  Fun movie.  If the preview hadn't spoiled it for me, I'd like it even more."

","A hotel on the outskirts of Las Vegas, Nevada is the primary setting for the new film Identify, directed by James Mangold (last behind the camera in Kate & Leopold) and written by Michael Cooney, who's last credit was Jack Frost II: Revenge of the Mutant Killer Snowmen.<br/><br/>The premise, as we are lead to believe, is simple, as a group of strangers are all stranded at a rural hotel after a storm blocks the road ways and exits.   Reading like a new age cast of Gilligan's Island, we have the movie star (Rebecca DeMornay), the Cop (Ray Liotta), the Chauffer (John Cusack), the married couple (John C. McGinley and Leila Kenzle), the convict (Jake Busey), the arguing newlyweds (Clea DuVall and William Lee Scott),  and the prostitute (Amanda Peet).  Throw in a mysterious man running the hotel and a child that doesn't want to talk, and we have the recipe for what turns out to be a murderous rampage.<br/><br/>Giving away nothing that isn't in the overblown trailers, the strangers start showing up dead each one more grizzly than the last.  To add to the suspense, each dead body comes with its own hotel key which counts down the murders starting from ten.<br/><br/>Everyone in the cast seems to do the best with what they have to work with, but we don't really get to know any of the characters too well.  John Cusack's character reveals that he was once a police officer that lost his edge, but all other characters remain mysterious and therefore each a suspect in each new murder.  <br/><br/>Along the way, there is a confusing back drop of a psychologist, played admirably by Alfred Molina, who is trying to convince a panel suits that a man they are putting to death in 24 hours is mentally unstable and should be sent to an institution rather than the electric chair (`His body killed those people, not his mind').   We jump back and forth between these discussions and the hotel and in the end, we learn of their connection.<br/><br/>Identity, is one of those rare films where the last act is actually better than the its predecessors.  As each member gets killed off without surprise (why in horror films do people find themselves running somewhere alone when they know there is strength in numbers?), we are left bored and tiresome. It's nothing we haven't seen before.  However,  James Mangold then relates the story back to the convicted killer, and that is when you sit up, straighten your collar, and understand both the motivations and the outcomes of each of the strangers.<br/><br/>Identity is a good film if for nothing else that it boldly tries something new and even the most clever of audiences probably didn't have the ending figured out.  Where it loses marks is in its cardboard writing and its typical ending which leaves enough room for a sequel while giving thriller fans one last jolt.<br/><br/>I recommend Identity.  All involved have done better work, but there is no doubt it is popcorn fare, and no doubt, you will be talking about the ending after the lights come up."

One by one the unlucky travelers are gruesomely murdered,but by whom? You won't know until the end unless you are a very attentive sleuth. Now I won't say much more because I'd hate to give anything away but go see it and I hope you enjoy! The only thing I disliked about this movie is I wish Alfred Molina had a bit more screen time.

And it is well cast.<br/><br/>And I would advise not reading the reviews because most critics like to give away the plot and this is a movie you should see without knowing a single plot twist.<br/><br/>
That being said,  I left the screening feeling somewhat exploited and manipulated.  And I'm not sure I can tell you why.  It's just a feeling.   While the script is very clever, it's as if this movie was written first with shock gags, and then the words were added in later.<br/><br/>And I must warn you that this movie falls into the category of horror not mystery. Yes.  There is a mystery, but the way this movie is presented, it really is a Horror film.  If you liked The Hitcher,  you will love this film.

"ArdentGuy","3","3","8","7 June 2004"," It's only a dream...so why should we care anymore?
","SPOILERS within....<br/><br/>I found the first two thirds of Identity to be exceptionally captivating. Very weird. Very interesting. I was immediately pulled into the story and joined the group of characters in trying to unravel the riddles of the events that are occurring. What a challenge to try to resolve the mystery of the countdown keys! How to explain the disappearing bodies! Or trying to come up with a plausible explanation how Jake Busey escapes but ends up back at the same Motel. Then comes the mystery of ""May 10th"". WOW! What fun to explore different theories. Identity was turning into some kind of Twilight Zone thriller.<br/><br/>Then two thirds of the way into this wonderful who-dunit came what has been called here, ""the twist"". Immediately after the ""May 10th"" mystery is set-up, it is revealed that all the events and characters, the movie itself, is taking place in the mind of a criminal. These characters are his multiple personalities playing out within his mind. The movie is someone's dream. The big ""twist"" is to tell we the audience that none of these people exist. ""Guess what folks,"" the movie says. ""None of what you have watched ever took place!""<br/><br/>My two biggest issues with Identity:<br/><br/>1. The copout of 'it's only a dream' to explain all the mysteries. I found this to be quite a letdown to what could have been an outstanding mystery. However I could have overlooked this flaw had it not been for the following.<br/><br/>2. The narrative returns to the dream world of the Motel after it is revealed that this is a completely fictional environment. What a waste of time. For the next seven and a half painful minutes we are asked to care about the outcome of characters that we have been told don't exist. This is a huge mistake for this film. At this point, I lost all interest in Identity. All of the characters pains, frustrations, feelings, desires, motivations....EVERYTHING became moot. Additional murders occur, but who cares: it's only a dream. These are no longer people being killed. We learn that Ray Liotta's character is not whom he appears to be. But again, who cares. He could have just as well been a space alien at this point. It's only a dream! There is no reason to care about the outcome of these imaginary people at the motel. In the end, when the final 'twist' of which character was actually responsible is revealed, Paris is killed. Her death is meaningless because she never really existed to begin with.<br/><br/>In short, I lost all sense of association with these non-characters. Identity would have been much better had it wrapped up all the action within Malcolm Rivers' mind before revealing that Malcolm's mind was the location of all the action. There can be no suspense in a man's dream where anything can happen."
"silverauk","3","3","8","15 September 2003"," Plot cannot be understood
","This movie is not comprehensible.  Distortion of the personality is too difficult to implement in a movie and to construct a script because the different imagined personalities cannot be identified in the action. Especially the child at the end cannot be well placed into the action. Some things have no importance: the birth-date of the persons involved are not relevant.  The woman in the beginning saying when the police-car is passing by:""there is a cold passing here"" does give you a wrong direction of the story.  The same with the story about the cemetery of the Indians, the names of the states.  The only good thing in the movie are the confrontation of the lawyers, the doctor of psychiatry and the judge."
"tomsview","4","2","5","30 January 2013"," Tricks itself
","There have been a number of films that paint their characters into corners from which there seems to be no escape, only to produce a wild card to get them out, often in the form of an identity or personality shift such as in ""Lost Highway"", ""Mulholland Drive"" and ""Vanilla Sky"". <br/><br/>However, I think the identity shift / multiple personality wand can only be waved so many times before it becomes not just predictable but also annoying. Movies that resolve convoluted plots in this way run the risk of cheating the audience. ""Identity"" might just be the film that uses this get-out-of-jail card one time too many. <br/><br/>The movie had me going for a while. As the credits roll, a psychiatrist makes audio notes about the case of a serial killer, Malcolm Rivers, who is to be executed the following day. Dr. Mallick, played by Alfred Molina, is attempting to have Rivers reassessed as mentally incompetent. <br/><br/>The scene then shifts to a Nevada motel during a violent storm. Thanks mainly to Alfred Hitchcock, most moviegoers know that booking into an isolated motel on a rainy night is one of the most dangerous things a human can do – on a par with exploring active volcanoes or surfing 100-foot waves in the mid-Atlantic. <br/><br/>A number of seemingly unconnected individuals make their way to the motel seeking shelter. Among them are characters played by John Cusack, Rebecca De Mornay, Ray Liotta and Amanda Peet.<br/><br/>After a number of murders, the survivors realise that a serial killer is picking them off one by one. At this point, the story is pretty much an updated version of Agatha Christie's ""And Then There Were None"". Then comes the zinger! It is established that everyone in the motel, dead or alive, shares the same birthday. How can this be? They all arrived at the motel by accident without any pre-planning. The reason is simple – they are all the same person! All the characters are manifestations of Malcolm Rivers' schizophrenic psyche. <br/><br/>Did I slap my forehead and say how clever is this? No, I thought what a total rip-off. The story moves at a fast clip until the end. This is just as well, because the holes in the film's logic are big enough to drive a motel housekeeping trolley through.<br/><br/>We also know from watching movies that serial killers are never guarded closely enough. There is virtually no straight jacket, prison cell, nor any medication that will keep them restrained for a whole movie. They always escape and the body count goes through the roof. Although ""Identity"" puts a twist on this unwritten law, we know by this time that the filmmakers have no shame and will use just about any trick to wrap the whole thing up. <br/><br/>The movie does provide a couple of good shocks. Sadly, although it goes for a slam-dunk at the end, ""Identity"" simply bounces out of the court instead."

The problem is, he sees this as an asset to the film, something that makes it good, while I see in this the core problem of this motion picture. Namely, in my opinion, for the first two thirds this movie is only slightly better (due to a good cast of actors) than your average horror / slasher flick... Yes, then it makes it's ""intellectual twist"" for the better, but that is not nearly enough to redeem it and raise it above average. All in all, nothing special."

The overall idea is pretty ingenious, and a nice twist (heh) on the thriller, and it's executed pretty well. Sure, it's as clichéd as can be, but I think that actually serves the story, instead of ruining it. The very last twist is pretty terrible, though, especially when the director felt he had to show everyone his own cleverness by repeating the key scenes throughout the movie that show that this plot development does have some merit.

It wasn't...<br/><br/>The movie starts out well enough...there is a terrible storm and people after people, end up at this desolate motel in the middle of nowhere when the roads wash out and become flooded.<br/><br/>This could make for a great storyline you think. Murder? Suspense? I was ready to go! Too bad that excitement couldn't have lasted. Halfway through the movie was where it started to fall apart.<br/><br/>It becomes terribly predictable. The people in the rooms start dying. Well of course you think it's Jake Busey (as usual a fine actor when it comes to being a ""bad guy"") because he is Ray Liotta's prisoner.<br/><br/>No...wait, he ends up being killed too, only shortly after the murders start. Wait then...it has to be the creepy motel owner. No...it's not him either...all of a sudden everything about this movie has that ""been there...seen it and am bored with it"" feel.<br/><br/>Where was the originality that I had thought this movie would be infused with? It went right out the window along with the plot line.<br/><br/>Let me explain...<br/><br/>The actual focus of this movie is on Malcom Rivers (Pruitt Taylor Vince)...a mass murderer who is up for execution...until Dr. Malick (Alfred Molina) discovers that it's not Malcolm himself who is committing these horrid murders...it's his many and varied, multiple personalities! As the movie progresses, each person that ""dies"" is actually one of Malcolm's personas.<br/><br/>Now in itself that may not sound bad...kind of original actually. Someone who is mentally ill ""curing"" themselves by having their personas meet and kill each other off. But the manner in which it is done, leaves so much to be desired that it almost becomes comical. The idea was brilliant, and so much could have been done with it but the execution was awful...and halfway through the movie at that...<br/><br/>For all purposes, these people stranded in this motel think they are real people, with real lives. Yet, suddenly, all of the murdered bodies start disappearing and no one sees how. To anyone with any deductive reasoning powers, this is your first clue that this seemingly original plot starts trudging down the road of predictability.<br/><br/>Maybe this was supposed to be nail biting suspense, but it wasn't. It made absolutely no sense. How could someone clean up so much blood, dispose of a head (belonging to Rebecca DeMornay,) and cart away the large build of a man like John C. McGinley and no one see? From this point forward it is a desperate attempt to keep the watcher hooked and it reminds me of the second ""Final Destination"" movie...with one misplaced and pathetic event after another and none of it helps the movie except to bring it to its end...which didn't come soon enough.<br/><br/>The ""kid persona"" of Malcolm's, being the killer at the end, was just too much. How pathetically predictable. Let's see...this kid is creepy, he doesn't say much, looks kind of evil...<br/><br/>One does not require a degree in rocket science to start putting the numbers together.<br/><br/>Let me just say that other than a bang up performance by John Cusack, Liotta and a stellar performance by John C. McGinley as a manic man with far too many issues, this movie left nothing much else to be desired...<br/><br/>How very disappointing..."

The film had me on the edge of my seat, wondering who the killer was. But God bless Hollywood for needing to shove another unnecessary twist ending into a movie that would have been JUST FINE without it. The build up of characters and occurrences were pretty interesting and kept you wondering who was behind it all. And then the ending just crapped on all of that because psychological twists have become all the rage after Sixth Sense, Usual Suspects, Fight Club, etc. Secret Window with Johnny Depp is another film that is ruined because of this old cliché trend.<br/><br/>The screenwriter should be fired and kicked in the balls for using what is now a cliché twist on such a promising murder mystery."

You have Ray Liotta, John Cusack, Amanda Peet (great in ""The Whole Nine Yards""), Alfred Molina (Spiderman 2), Clea Du Vall, Rebecca De Mornay (quite a surprise), and a few other familiar faces. <br/><br/>All of these stars are cast into a motley bunch of characters that are held up in a local motel due to a rainstorm. The introductory scenes are cleverly tied together in a sequence of demonstrations of how one thing leads to another. The final destination for all of these encounters is the motel, which seems to resemble an island in the middle of nowhere. I can't tell you much more of this film without ruining it. I can say that a convict arrives in the custody of an officer. He escapes and one of the hotel guests ends up dead. Murder continues as another and yet another of the group is killed.<br/><br/>The redeeming quality of this film and the main reason to watch it is in its portrayal of everything appearing as what it is, yet being something entirely different.

","Who would ever in their life guess that the writer of ""Identity,"" a fairly clever whodunnit horror-thriller, wrote and directed ""Jack Frost,"" the underwritten, deeply flawed (and just plain stupid) thriller about a killer snowman? Not I. But yet I suppose strange things really do happen, because ""Identity"" is written by Michael Cooney, who isn't nearly as looney in his writing as he was for the other films of his, which includes ""Jack Frost 2: Revenge of the Mutant Killer Snowman"" (2000).<br/><br/>""Identity"" starts out strong and ends fairly well - though the ending was a bit strange, to say the least. It is about a group of ten people who get stranded at a run-down motel during a desert rainstorm in Nevada. Unable to leave the motel, the occupants start to die off one-by-one, though they have no idea who is the killer nor why s/he is killing. Sound like ""Ten Little Indians"" to you? Well, it may, but the underlying premise of the film is wholly different. <br/><br/>The occupants include a limo driver named Ed (John Cusack), who was driving a down-on-her-luck movie star (Rebecca DeMornay) when he hit a woman in the middle of an interstate. The woman's husband (John C. MicGinley, who doesn't look a day older than he did in ""Platoon"") and son help their mother back to a crummy old motel run by a comical man named Larry (John Hawkes). Ed goes out to find an ambulance, but instead stumbles upon a flooded road and a hooker, Paris (Amanda Peet), who was fleeing to Florida to start her life over fresh again before the rain came.<br/><br/>Ed's limo gets stuck in the floodwater and two newlyweds agree to give him and Paris a ride back to the motel. All four return to the motel, defeated by the blocked roads, when a policeman (Ray Liotta) transporting a homicide convict (Jake Busey) shows up, requesting a room. Now there are ten people with completely different backgrounds, stranded in a motel. But they may have more in common than they think.<br/><br/>People start dying in an apparently random order. And every time someone is murdered, a room key is left behind with the dead corpse, signifying a countdown until there are only a handful of people still alive.<br/><br/>To spoil the end of ""Identity"" would be wrong, but I will say that I had guessed it before I even saw the movie. I guessed the end from the trailer. This kind of ruined some parts of the film for me, and I must say that ""Identity"" would have held my suspense even more so than it did if the trailer hadn't decided to give so much away.<br/><br/>I really enjoy whodunnits, especially clever ones. I like when a handful of people with no connection find out they may have more of a connection than they believed at first. ""Clue"" with Tim Curry was a film bashed by critics and audiences, but I loved it. ""Identity"" is in the same vein as this but it isn't as funny nor literal. It is more of a psychological-thriller-whodunnit than a plain ol' whodunnit. Fans of Agatha Christy (who wrote, if you don't already know, such famous novels as ""Murder on the Orient Express"") may be baffled by this film. Many people will be looking for the killer the entire time, guessing who it is, but in the last half hour the plot finally starts to unveil itself.<br/><br/>John Cusack gives one of the strongest performances of his career as Ed, an ex-cop who suspects there may be something going on under all this, more than meets the eye. I have a few theories about his character and some of the others, but I would have to give away the end of the movie to delve into these theories, so I will therefore resist, and just leave it with the fact that I really like Ray Liotta, but John Cusack stole the show.<br/><br/>The movie is directed by James Mangold, who wrote and directed 1997's ""Cop Land"" with Sylvester Stallone and Robert De Niro. He's a talented director. His inspiration to be a suspenseful director shines through here - with a bit of practice and imagination (which this film clearly has), he could become a great director.<br/><br/>I enjoyed ""Identity,"" I really did. It was only 90 minutes long, for one matter, and never became repetitive. Even with knowing the ending, I was still held in suspense by the film, which makes me wonder just how suspenseful it must be to those who have no idea what the ending will be like.<br/><br/>My only complaint? The film switches courses a few too many times. It seems as though it doesn't always know what it wants to be. At times it is a thriller, at times it is a horror, at times it is a drama, at times it is a comedy, at times it is a psycho movie, and at times it is surreal. But there is some great talent in this movie. It is cleverly written, even if the ending seems a bit strange and an easy way out. I haven't seen an ending like this on a whodunnit before. It will surprise a lot of people. That may be standard nowadays with films like ""The Sixth Sense"" cruising around, but ""Identity"" seems - for the most part - to stay true to the classic whodunnits, and for that I give it a lot of credit. It is a very entertaining and suspenseful film. <br/><br/>4/5 stars -<br/><br/>John Ulmer"

The movie is nothing but a lame and predictable ghost story. First you see these strangers all stuck in this hotel during a storm and really horrible and cheesy accidents start happening to them. Slowly they all start dying one by one and obviously you start wondering who the killer is. But near the movie you start to predict that the hotel and all those people never even exist, except in the killers mind that's telling his story who was there once and really killed all these people in a hotel when he was a little boy. The ending was absolutely ridiculous and left me wondering what the point of this movie was. The story had nothing to say, except a unbearable pointless mess that's waiting for you at the end.

The story line in this movie is non linear so you get disinterested easily. I was interested in the first 10 - 15 minutes of the movie and then after that it just got more stupid as time went by.

But the truth is it's just one tangled and intertwined story that, literally, takes reaching the end of the film before the logical side of things get ironed out.

Who's behind these brutal murders, and why this is happening, is a movie plot-twist that, I suppose, is intended to end all movie plot-twists. You judge for yourself and then tell me that Hollywood doesn't overplay mental-disorder, and such, to the point of being downright ridiculous far too often.<br/><br/>The cast of Identity is headed by the talents of, none other than, Mr. Leave-It-To-Beaver, John Cusack, and Mr. Damage-Face, Ray Liotta."

McGinley, Jake Busey and Pruitt Taylor Vince. Music is by Alan Silvestri and cinematography by Phedon Papamichael Jr.<br/><br/>Inspired by Agatha Christie's Ten Little Indians, Identity pitches 10 characters trapped at a motel who begin getting killed off one by one...<br/><br/>If you are going to do yet another take on Christies superb literary source then at least bring some freshness, so how nice to find that Identity does in fact ironically have its own. Set up is suitably in keeping with murder mystery shenanigans, there's major flooding and our host of characters are bound to a shabby motel run by a shabby John Hawkes. On the edges of the frame we have another story where multiple killer Malcolm Rivers (the wonderful wobbly eyed P.T. Vince) is under interrogation to test for insanity to stave off his impending execution.<br/><br/>Mangold uses flashbacks to put the various characters at the motel, in how they came to be there. There's a creative ambitiousness about how Mangold constructs the pic that draws you in, which come the finale will either have you satiated or stupefied. The murder sequences are very well put together, with a couple being well ghoulish, and it's a very impressive cast of actors working their way through the formulaic but fascinatingly cheat free psychological murk.<br/><br/>It's not as smart as it thinks it is but this has enough of an absorbing pull, and no little intelligence, to lift it higher than many other Agatha 10 copies. 7/10"

","Ten strangers are brought together at a remote desert motel one stormy night. Before long, a series of murders begins to whittle them down. But all is not what it seems.<br/><br/>The defining factor of Identity is its twist-in-the-tail ending. It seems to have divided audiences on account of this. But I for one think it works really well. The idea of the dramas playing out being the strange fruits of some sort of conflict within the mind of a maniac with a multiple personality disorder is quite a good one and allows the story to go off in over-the-top directions with the fall back that it is after all not real and the imaginings of a psychologically troubled individual. For this reason I guess you could argue that the story could have dipped into even more surreal ideas if anything - events do seem a little more generic than they needed to be given the opportunity the central idea allows for the story to go wild and unhinged directions. The main narrative is effectively a combination of a whodunit with some slasher movie elements. It's not a classic and it could have used its potential better but it remains a nicely original take on a traditional genre nevertheless."

"Leofwine_draca","6","1","2","4 August 2016"," Murder mystery with an outrageous twist
","An intriguing whodunit, a murder mystery, packed with shocks, violence, gore, and death, but oddly respectable thanks to the strong casting, which makes this movie a lot more entertaining than it might have otherwise been. Now, the success of this particular film hinges on a major plot twist towards the end which, however, is largely guessable if you consider the clues and the evidence leading up to it. I'm not sure whether I like this twist or not, but it does make the film different; without it, it would have appeared to be just another run-of-the-mill slasher. With it, it sits oddly on the borderline of being original and being extremely cheesy. I'm content to sit on the fence and say I enjoyed the film on its strengths alone.<br/><br/>Such strengths include a number of effective shocks (sometimes, this film veers close to FINAL DESTINATION territory in the sheer shock value of the death scenes alone), good music, and developed characters. The casting is excellent, with the dependable John Cusack putting in a typically strong performance and Ray Liotta stealing all his scenes as an aggressive, intense cop (no surprises there). Other familiar faces show up – Alfred Molina, Rebecca De Mornay – to add strength to the show. For the most part this is entertaining murder-mystery stuff, moving from one strong and violent moment to the next; the twist somehow makes it all seem silly, but I'd say its worth a look anyway."

Those who like original psycho thrillers with weird conclusions that request some reflections and are not that easy to understand will definitely like the final which is rather hard to predict. In fact, the ending leads to two conclusions and one of it was very easy to predict for a genre connoisseur as I am but the second and more important part is quite impossible to find out.<br/><br/>Those who like more traditional crime movies with police investigations and many clues that finally lead to the murderer in the end might find the ending too complicated, too difficult to understand and overall too weird.<br/><br/>Personally, I liked the ending as it left me one some reflections and thoughts. It's simply different from what you're used to and I like this experimental courage of the script writers. This doesn't mean that the ending is complete nonsense or as surreal as David Lynch movie, it's still all rather logic to explain.<br/><br/>If you are a fan of dark psycho thrillers and the famous ""Ten Little Indians"" concept and if you're not afraid of movies where you need to do some additional intellectual efforts to understand everything, you will definitely adore this flick that has no truly visible weak points apart of it short length and a couple of stereotypes that are introduced in the beginning."
"metalpunk009","7","1","2","8 January 2012"," First half=Amazing. Second half=Not so much.
","Identity was a great thriller. It very much reminded me of something that David Fincher would make. It had all these elements that make for an excellent thriller, just combine that with some good characters, great acting, and wah-lah! It was something else. <br/><br/>Having said that, I should point out that the key word in that summary was, well, ""was"". Identity ""was"" a great thriller, until we came close to the end. Then all the poop started spilling out. <br/><br/>The basic plot of the film goes a little something like this: While driving an actress to her destination, a limo driver accidentally ends up in a car accident. The woman in the car is hurt terribly, while her son and husband are unscathed (physically, anyway). So they hitch a ride with a young couple to the nearest motel in hopes to escape the rain and treat the woman's wounds. That same night, a cop happens to stop by with a convict in tow. After the night rolls on a bit, the convict eventually escapes and starts picking off the people one by one.<br/><br/>Let me first start off by saying this: What in all of hell were they thinking with that twist? That was one of the most ridiculous, convoluted, silly twists I've ever seen. The first half of this movie was amazing. It had a great atmosphere, great acting, and great suspense. Once the twist was revealed, it was all downhill from there. I think that if they had spent just a teency bit more time with the script, they could've seriously made some changes that would've benefited this movie greatly. <br/><br/>Aside from those aspects of the movie, there are some things that do help it. For one thing, the acting is pretty damn good. John Cusack, Ray Liotta, Amanda Peet, John Hawkes, and John C. McGinley all give great performances. The only people I didn't like were that stupid young couple. All the chick ever did was whine and scream while the boyfriend was just some idiot d-bag. <br/><br/>Director James Mangold (director of two films I love: Walk the Line and 3:10 to Yuma) definitely knew what he was going for tone-wise and pace-wise with the movie. The tone is very effective and serves the movie greatly. One of the reasons I said this reminded me of something Fincher would make was because it had that same sort-of lighting. You know, that greenish tint. The film moved along fine until the end, when they just kept piling on the twists and made you feel exasperated. <br/><br/>Overall, despite my gripes with that stupid twist, I still say that Identity is at least worth a rental, if not just catching it on TV, like I did. An OK movie, not a great one like it could've been."

The cast is the definition of all star, and all of them gave above average to tremendous performances. Cusac was great. Amanda Peet was wonderful. Alfred Molina, who didn't really have a big part, was his old predictably incredible self. Anything this guy touches is gold as far as I'm concerned. Bottom line is, you need to see this movie, preferably with someone you know and trust. Because if you are hanging around with anyone like the characters in this movie, you should be afraid.

It reminds me of Shutter Island, a story that takes you one way and then blind sides you later on in the movie. Every time I thought I knew who was behind this mess, a new suspect showed up.<br/><br/>What I really liked about this movie is that it isn't the standard Hollywood horror movie. It's not some movie where rebellious teenagers run around in their underwear having sex and being hunted down. This movie instead relied on very well developed characters, characters that many people could identify with. It relied on classic plot structure instead of sex and violence.<br/><br/>This movie does still have some plot holes. But I was easily able to forgive them because of how good the movie was. I recommend this thriller to people who love thrillers and don't care for the standard Hollywood thriller."

The camera-work was fantastic and quite possibly the film's main merit, the story(on a parallel with And Then There Were None, but with definite plot differences) and the performances from the likes of John Cusack, Ray Liotta, Rebecca DeMornay, Jake Busey and Amanda Peet were nothing short of superb. And the film's length and pace were just right. My only problem with Identity, which was nearing to perfection, was the final solution, I did find it confusing and a tad implausible. But overall, it is a taut and solid thriller, that ticks almost all the right boxes. 9/10 Bethany Cox"

","What are the chances for a decent, satisfactory ending for this movie? One in a million! And it hits the nail perfectly, and later hits you in the head several times until you have no choice but accept it.<br/><br/>I watched this movie after 6 years of it's original release and I'm very sorry about it; I mean, I had the chance to watch it before but I was reluctant due to my hatred towards Hollywood's idea of making Horror and Thriller films.<br/><br/>The plot starts as any 90's slasher and then with the correct pacing, moves to be a whodunit Thriller, and ends up being a thrilling roller coaster mixed with tension, excellent dialog, and nerve tensing twist situations.<br/><br/>I can't give you details because it would be very unfair for those who haven't seen it but, I want to convince people like me to watch it...please read.<br/><br/>I'm an avid Horror moviegoer and I watch anything related to the genre, and for those who are also hardcore fans, please give this Hollywood product a chance; you won't regret. This is a clever, thrilling, violent and emotional film.<br/><br/>You will find great acting specially from super badass Ray Liotta, the always talented John Cusack, the super sexy bomb and my wife (I'm living a dream OK?) Amanda Peet. The rest of the cast is excellent; even Alfred Molina is extraordinary even that he has a few on-screen minutes.<br/><br/>The Direction is perfect because it's stylish, has some wild camera angles, and best of all, it keeps developing under a dark atmosphere. Excellent settings and special effects. Plus the gore though minimal is good.<br/><br/>The ending will leave you wondering ""what the hell?!"" but in a positive manner. Expect a really good Thriller with excellent ingredients of Horror, Mystery and Suspense. The most important situations will make you feel sad, horrified, but something important is that you will think really hard and feel for the characters. Now, that's a very complete visual experience.<br/><br/>This should be a cult classic soon."

","""Identity"" is a much better mystery/slasher than expected.<br/><br/>**SPOILERS**<br/><br/>During a torrential rainstorm, Ed Dakota, (John Cusack) manages to bring George York, (John C. McGinley) and his son Timmy, (Bret Loehr) to Larry's, (John Hawkes) motel in the middle of nowhere to help them seek shelter after a hit-and-run accident. Realizing that Paris, (Amanda Peet) Rhodes, (Ray Liotta) Ginny, (Clea DuVall) Lou, (William Lee Scott) and Caroline Suzanne, (Rebecca De Mornay) are all trapped at the motel as well because of the storm, all the normal ways of escape prove futile and decide to ride out the storm. Suddenly realizing that they're being killed off one-by-one in a series of gruesome murders, they suspect everyone has a motive for the killings, and as their numbers dwindle, they race to solve the killings and get away from the hotel alive.<br/><br/>The Good News: This was a lot better than expected, and delivered a lot of good parts. One of the better parts is the fact that this one has a really great atmosphere that makes it really feel really great. The torrential rainstorm going on the background is mostly responsible for this, and the way it works is rather intriguing. By having the characters constantly going into and out of it and appearing completely drenched in the rain, and combined with the way that the mystery plays out is perfect at keeping the suspense up. The setting of the film, where they're at in the motel and the way it's lined out, it allows for a bunch of suspense and tension, and with the way the film allows the killer to be revealed, manage to make the film feel really tense and suspenseful. The way that it does work around the mystery of the killer angle is perhaps the best part of the whole film, as it's what makes the whole thing come together. By enabling every single one of them the opportunity to be tagged as the killer, it puts all of the film's focus into the clever tricks to do this. The gag about the names, birth-dates and the room-key version is all done rather nicely and all of these are apart of what helps the film along with it's impressive way of bringing along the suspense in the film. There's also the way it reveals the killer, which is one of the single most shocking ones in the genre, being one that's never expected nor feeling like it's there merely for the sake of a twist. It's nicely shocking and actually works, using the montage to great effect and coming up with some nice scenes. The last thing here is that the kills aren't so bad, and actually work nicely within the film, being unique enough that they're an overall nice collection which is really good to see. There's a baseball bat rammed down the throat, a couple are run over by cars, one of whom is rammed into a wall, there's a vicious stabbing in the stomach, a nice decapitation and a multitude of gunshots, among others in here. It's a healthy enough collection to make a really nice selection of kills here. All of these here are the film's good points.<br/><br/>The Bad News: There wasn't too much really wrong with this one. The main flaw to this is the way that the film seems to plod along with it's pacing. Although it never once feels dull or boring, there's no real surge of adrenaline running through the scenes in here to really make it exciting or over-the-top, and while this keeps moving along nicely, none of these are really all that engaging and that means things just happen here, not the proper kind of reaction needed for a film like this. The other flaw to this one is the fact that most of the film's kills are off-screen, meaning that the kills are all reduced to mere splashes or aftermath, and the ones that are shown on-screen aren't all that graphic, making the aftermath the one part here that gets the blood over. These here are all the film's flaws.<br/><br/>The Final Verdict: There was a lot better stuff in here than expected, making this one enjoyable and highly recommended. Look into this one if you're a fan of the genre, love your slashers with mystery or fans of the creative side, while those who aren't that into any of those should heed caution with it.<br/><br/>Rated R: Graphic Violence and Graphic Language"

","It is a thriller of a class! <br/><br/>The idea is novel and how the truth unwraps itself layer after layer is just so subtle and skillful that it will keep you guessing right until the ending shot, and probably sometime afterwards. As a law student it reminds me of the physical and mental capacity to commit crime and this idea is mastered at a top-notch level, and the reality layer and the imaginary layer work really well together between each other. Of course the exuberant way to project the mental state of the murderer into the evil kid instead of the policeman is superb and totally unexpected (at least to me)! It is definitely one of those twists and climaxes that will take one's breath away for a while! Great job done and apparently underrated and deserves more recognition. Go and see it!"

","Identity is the story of 10 strangers who are stranded at a motel overnight due to rain flooding the roads.<br/><br/>The movie unfolds nicely when the people start to die one by one which will keep you guessing until the ending twist which I can promise you will not see coming.

The movie throws out clues here and there and there are some points which leave you totally confused.<br/><br/>You will need to concentrate during this movie and whatever you do if you're watching with a friend who has already seen it don't ask them ""hey what just happened there?"", the movie will confuse you but all is explained by the end of the movie. The dialog is great and John Cusack plays a terrific lead role along side Amanda Peet, Ray Liotta and John C Mcginley.<br/><br/>The tension grows as the characters slowly start to get killed off which brings the survivors closer as they learn unusual things about each other that they strangely have in common. The fact that the entire movie is at night during a huge storm creates an extra dimension of fear and makes you feel completely unsafe and uneasy during the movie (which is always a great factor in a horror/thriller).<br/><br/>The movie does a great job at tricking the audience into believing they know what will happen in the end, and just when you think you've got it, it completely flips on you.<br/><br/>This movie proves to be one of the greatest psychological thrillers of all time which adds a whole other dimension of fear and mystery to the film which is unique and delivers everything you expect, and a whole lot more!"

","I watched this movie when it came out about three years ago, and I've watched it twice since; the latter being a week earlier. The premise of this movie is quite stupid to begin with, but I won't get into that. I'll say it simply; it does not deserve such a high rating.<br/><br/>I won't say it's a horrible movie. It's a movie you'd want to spend your time on wondering ""What the heck is going on???"" and then the thrilling end puts a stop to everything and you exit the room/theater smiling to yourself. It's mindless entertainment. Nothing else.<br/><br/>The casting is really...average, the acting is OK, the cinematography is good, and I really liked how the story progressed, but this whole point that all the events don't actually take place is stupid and un-thrilling. It takes away all the fun from the movie.<br/><br/>All in all, it's worth a watch, but don't expect much at all. 5/10"
"vocklabruck","7","1","2","22 December 2006"," Great thriller!!!
","I watched this movie and I really enjoyed. I found myself surprised how good it was. Since there are a couple twists near the end you feel desperately the need to watch it again to see the situation from the new point of view, and keep enjoying. Warning. If you watch it once again it may be weak the second time because of some ""plot holes"" if you want to call it that way.<br/><br/>---MAJOR SPOILERS ---<br/><br/>The movie works because it claims to be about 10 people who meet in a motel forced by a storm. Then these people are front a killer in disguise, one of them is the killer and you keep wondering who. Near the end the first twist shows you that these 10 people and the motel never existed because they are all in the mind of a convict who suffers a multiple personality syndrome and each person is a different personality of his. When you find this truth all the situation in the motel shocked you because you know it is not real, but you do not care because actually this happens very near the end. This is handled greatly, some minutes later there is another twist that is great too! I have to say the finale is PERFECT because this convict hates whores because his mom was a whore and she abandoned him, so the whore must be killed too, but I would have really liked to see the fat guy with some peace of mind and with the girl in the orange grove living her second chance. So I would have liked the finale being just the blending when the girl sings the song.<br/><br/>I rented this movie in DVD so I could watch it again knowing the truth. Why did I say the second time it may be weak? Because when you know the killer is the little boy you find strange that he was able to do all the murders and here is where you see the ""plot holes"": There is a storm out there, but the boy murders people and keeps his clothes always dry. Also he has the strength to confront adult people and kill them? Well, he did not kill everyone, but almost. Anyway this ""plot holes"" are not real plot holes, because you know this all happens inside the convict mind so everything is possible.<br/><br/>What is a real plot hole is at the finale, when the doctor opens the cage door while the fat guy is struggling himself. Careless move from a doctor! And also why the fat guy killed his doctor? OK, in his mind it was the whore, but during all the dream there were murders at the motel and he did not kill anyone at the office! Maybe just because he was tied?<br/><br/>What I did not like in this movie is that I found many homage to many other horror movies Psycho, Seven and I Know What You Did Last Summer among others. I laughed when the Amanda Peet characters cries through the window ""I give up! What the hell do you want, you sick bastard?"" I was expecting she spinning and shouting ""What are you waiting for? What are you waiting for?"" from I Know What You Did Last Summer satirized by Scary Movie.<br/><br/>All in all, as I said I liked this movie a lot. And for the people who thinks it is impossible for the child to kill the others, again, it is all in the fat guy's mind, so everything is possible there, and that is why sometimes you see the motel a mile far and suddenly you are right at the motel. It is impossible to walk a mile in a second. Right? But everything is possible in the mind."

Sure it was good too, but for all of you who have seen it don't you think it's almost exactly like ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre?!"" A group of teens driving along, their car breaks down, they stop, meet up with some creepy old man, and eventually there is only one or two survivors out of the whole group. YEESH.

","When a nasty storm hits a hotel, ten strangers are stranded within and as they begin to know each other, they discover they are being killed off one by one.<br/><br/>This is a really dark film that succeeds in confusing you and gets you wondering whodunnit, I would have been disappointed if it had ended any other way. Identity is a stylish looking film, full of wet, dark imagery that increases the creep factor extensively. The film is also suspenseful throughout, featuring plenty of genuine scares and surprises for the most part. However, as the film continues to run, it becomes obvious that we, the audience, are being set up for a switch in the film's basic premise. I figured out that they were all different personalities, but did not see Liotta being a convict, or the kid being the killer.<br/><br/>The direction of the film is seemingly influenced in equal amounts by Fincher, Hitchcock and Agatha Christie, James Mangold has produced an interesting and intriguing piece.Throughout the film, I was impressed with the shooting and general ambiance created. The acting, whilst a tad patchy in places was convincing, and this aided the director in his attempts to inflict upon the audience suspense of Hitchcockian levels.<br/><br/>The acting was decent, of course Liotta is as always the hot tempered guy about to blow in every scene, Cusack gives a great performance as always and I was surprised by Peets performance, she hold up with the other great actors on the set as if she had the same amount of acting experience with them. The chemistry was really good as well between the characters, even though most of the time they distrust each other.<br/><br/>I essentially believe that this film is worth watching for all fans of a wide range of genres: the thriller, horror, and pure whodunits (especially anyone who has read Christie's And Then There Were None). This is a film that tries to throw a twist in and actually succeeds with it."

Which i duly did. The coolest things about movies such as this, is the way they are constructed, much like ""Dead End"" you can theorise and guess your way through the whole, but how often do you ever get it right, i know i never have.<br/><br/>Anyway, the perfect premise is set when we fade and it's a dark and stormy night, off into the distance lit up by neon light we see a desolate motel and thats when the fun begins. The introduction of the ten principle characters and how they came to be was truly something, some would call it the fate of the gods. <br/><br/>The cast, headed by John Cusack, all aquitted themselves most admirably, especially Pruitt Taylor Vince, in the pivotal role of Malcolm Rivers, the man with the story, unfolding within his own mind.<br/><br/>I had a sudden notion, by the time you arrive at the conclusion, once you have deliberated over the evidence presented, you are going to ask yourself one simple question, ""Who am I Here""? after you've viewed the film in it's entirety, your going to think you did it.<br/><br/>Now that is a mystery fit for solving. I must also add that the extras on the DVD release are pretty smart, especially the writer's commentary, i didn't realize that Michael Cooney was English, nothing wrong with that, as his commentary, the evolution of a screenplay was one of the most involving commentaries i've ever had the pleasure of listening to.<br/><br/>On a rating out of 10, on a dark and stormy night such as this, dare i say 10 out of 10, without hesitation."

I found it an interesting tribute to PSYCHO, the mother of all demented slasher films but it also owes a lot to Ten Little Indians and other classic who dunits. Where identity deviates is in it's original twist(which I will not spoil) at the end. The acting throughout by all involved is exceptional, especially Cusack and Peet. There are some lapses in logic in the third act, the transporting of a serial killer by such careless methods doesn't ring true but we must suspend disbelief for the sake of the ending. All in all I loved identity for its ingenious take on a familiar tale. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED."
"mentalcritic","8","1","2","27 July 2004"," It mostly works...
","Identity is a hard film to describe without giving the story away. In fact, every little second of screentime is important to the story, so talking about events is a difficult thing to do without giving away too much. I will try to discuss it in general point form, but if you haven't seen it already, consider yourself advised. Even describing the setup without ruining a surprise is a tough ask.<br/><br/>The cast assembled at the hotel is exceptionally strong together, and they give the film all of its impact. John Cusack in particular arrests the viewer and gives them someone to get behind. Amanda Peet turns in a rare performance that I don't hate her in. Ray Liotta makes the plot twist of his character work like only a true professional can do. By the time the film reveals why he's constantly yelling and screaming at everyone who dares to disagree with him, he really manages to get under the viewer's skin.<br/><br/>The real surprise in this cast, however, is Jake Busey, who does the Obnoxiously Ugly Contingent Of Hollywood proud. During his screentime, his mannerisms and delivery really sell him as a serial killer. If the viewer isn't afraid of the big unknown that the film sets up, they will definitely be afraid of Jake. The guy is big and authoriative enough to sell the character in spite of so little being known about him. But then, we know very little about any character here, even after they try to explain themselves.<br/><br/>As various events conspire to bring the principal cast to a simple hotel that appears to be in the middle of nowhere, we slowly get a feeling something is not quite right here. Soon after everyone arrives, one of the guests is killed, and a keychain found not far from their corpse. The keychain corresponds to the number of the room she is situated in, and so the game begins. Most of the people in the hotel share a room with somebody, but the keychain links things together in a way that is subtle and obvious at the same time.<br/><br/>Where the film lapses is the ending. Not only does it feel too abrupt, it has little, if any, lead-in or hint, making it feel as though it was thrown in for the sole purpose of closing the film. Sometimes this isn't so bad, but considering the standard set by the rest of the film, it is a big disappointment. Still, the film entertains for ninety minutes, and that's certainly more than a lot of recent films seem to feel we have a right to ask."

I am sure you can identify with some films that present the same violentiosco plot. The actors in `Identity' are renowned and easy to identify: John Cusack, Ray Liotta, Amanda Peet, Alfred Molina, and Rebecca De Mornay. However, this acting ensemble was mostly middling here. `Identity' was suspenseful in several homage Hitchcockian scenes. However, the problem was that Director James Mangold became a bit psychotic with the multitudinous repetition of them. Mangold turned out to be `The Man Who Knew Too Little' about direction in this project. He was `Notorious'! `Identity' identifies several suspenseful elements of effective storytelling, but for the most part this one was for `The Birds'. *** Average"

Someone told me that it was a psychological thriller, and more to the point, just a movie, and so you can't truly get it....but tell me!  Seriously, the movie had me all excited to finally figure out what the purpose for all the killing and clues, for what?  I guess I'm just venting, because they led me up for something I thought would be a great ending, and it turned out I got jipped.  I'm so glad I didn't go pay to see this, although in all honesty I liked the movie a lot, it was just that the last fifteen minutes made me really angry.<br/><br/>John Cusack and Ray Liota are so good in this movie I want to scream. Okay, maybe I'm exaggerating a bit, but they really were very good. I was extremely impressed with Amanda Peet as well.  She always seemed like a bit of a light weight to me in most of her roles, but she did a really good job in this one (except that her accent tended to fade in and out at times.  Where was she supposed to be from again?  Florida, living in Nevada with a Tennessee accent?).<br/><br/>And finally, Clea DuVall.  She is such an underrated actress, I can't believe how few widely known films she's actually done.  You may remember her from The Faculty, with Josh Hartnett and Elijah Wood.  One of her bigger roles.  Or how about the stuck up teen painter from She's All That, that tries to convince Cook's character to kill herself? She was also in The Astronaut's Wife, she played Charlize Theron's sister. She's been doing these small roles for a while now, and you can really see her raw talent in this movie.  I love her!  She should do so many more movies, and I think she was one of the best actresses/actors in this film. She really helped make it work.  Without her (granted it still probably would have been a good movie, but) it wouldn't have been the same.<br/><br/>I give this movie, 10 being the highest a 7.5.  Just 'cause it p***ed me off that they didn't do as good a job explaining the ending as they should have. I hate it when they do that.  But, it was a good story overall and a really good watch. There's some blood, a head here and there, and more than one car accident (I.E. people get killed in this movie beware.), so if you don't like those kinds of films, and because you see John Cusack on the cover and think ""America's Sweethearts"", think again...it 'aint the sequel to that.

","When I heard that Identity lends a lot of the Classic Agatha Christie novel Ten Little Niggers my curiosity was aroused.  I like this novel very much, but never really saw a good presentation on film. This movie does start off as a take on the novel: ten people are stranded in a remote location, they all have something in common and then the killing starts.  It's quite suspenseful and keeps you wondering who the killer is. But there are little hints and another storyline that makes you suspect something else might be afoot.<br/><br/>Then all of a sudden half way through the movie you're hit on the forehead with an enormous revelation and plot twist of almost `Sixth Sense' proportions.  This changes the `who's the killer' routine completely and unfortunately also reduces the tension felt before the twist.  But still a very good thriller until the decision of the writers to put in another plot twist at the end that completely spoiled the movie for me.<br/><br/>The performances in this movie are anything between average and very good, but it's John Cusack, who seems to get better with each movie, again who really carries the movie.  Both sound and vision are very well balanced to serve the mood of the story.<br/><br/>So would I recommend this movie for your viewing pleasure?

The following hour keeps the tension up, with a number of red-herrings thrown into the mixture to ensure this is not your average run-of-the-mill murder mystery.  The dark and stormy surroundings also work wonders, complimenting the remote location to create a really nervy atmosphere.  Then it gets weird.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong: I liked the death-row convict/psychosis revelation, and felt it - initially - added to an already entertaining and original picture. However, the writers obviously felt this alone was enough to satisfy the audience and did not put the effort into successfully integrating it into the plot of the rest of the movie.  Really, this shock should have been brought in 20-30 minutes earlier (or the run-time extended by this amount), allowing it to develop into the story and not just appear as a tacked-on afterthought.  Regrettably, Identity nose-dives from this point on, with twist after surprise after shock crammed into the remaining minutes, making redundant the great work that had preceded it and leaving you feeling like you've just watched a slightly more bizarre conclusion to 'Along Came A Spider'.  The less said about the final couple of scenes, the better.   <br/><br/>
Could've been good, but one or two plot twists too far render Identity into just the 'watchable' category.<br/><br/>6/10"

"rparham","8","1","2","18 January 2004"," Good, but another big ""surprise""
","Identity is the latest in a long line of recent thrillers that seems to live for ""the twist.""  Popularized recently mostly by films written and directed by M. Night Shyamalan, ""the twist"" is a feature of a film that develops in one direction to suddenly end up in another.  Much to my surprise, Identity handles it's primary twist well, and I commend it for that.  However, on the way to it's main twist, it tries to hard to build in others that are quickly revealed, much to my chagrin.<br/><br/>The film is set primarily at a lonely motel in the middle of the desert.  A group of strangers, from various walks of life, find themselves stranded at this motel in the midst of a torrential rain storm.  One by one, they begin to die off in various rather gruesome ways, leaving the survivors to be suspicious of each other as to who is the killer.  The characters are all different, and as such utilizes the seeming requirement that a film with this kind of situation (small group of characters trapped in a secluded location) feature unique, and sometimes slightly weird, ""types"" to fill out it's roster.  The primary character is Ed, played by John Cusack, a limo driver transporting a fallen movie star (Rebecca DeMornay) to a job, and he quickly finds himself in his element as a former policeman while trying to solve the murders. The rest of the bunch is composed of Rhodes (Ray Liotta), a detective transporting Robert Maine (Jake Busey), a convicted killer; Paris (Amanda Peet) a prostitute on the way to a better life; newlyweds Ginny (Clea Duvall) and Lou (William Lee Scott); Larry (John Hawkes) the motel manager, and finally George (John C. McGinley) a rather mawkish man who's wife was injured in a traffic accident.  Even though they are ""types"" most of the actors do a good job of filling out their characters.<br/><br/>Identity is a stylish looking film, full of wet, dark imagery that increases the creep factor extensively.  The film is also suspenseful throughout, featuring plenty of genuine scares and surprises for the most part. However, as the film continues to run, it becomes obvious that we, the audience, are being set up for a switch in the film's basic premise, which I will not reveal here.  However, it is not too surprising when this switch happens, as various earlier scenes telegraph it to us.  Director James Mangold and screenwriter Michael Cooney have slightly sabotaged one of the film's central conceits by constantly reminding us of what appears at first to be a subplot and eventually turns out to be the movie's primary plot.  I think that this twist would have worked better had there been almost no setup, or at least a lot less than was featured.<br/><br/>That being said, Cooney and Mangold aren't through with us after that first twist.  There are others to come, and the final one is quite a surprise that was not nearly as obvious.  From that point of view, Identity is a success, proving that a filmmaker can still surprise the audience in a time when thrillers abound with twist endings becoming more and more unsurprising in their revelations.  You occasionally find yourself wishing that directors and writers would just make a straightforward thriller and leave the twists and turns in the past occasionally instead of always trying to formulate the next big ""surprise."""

","This is one of those films that thank god doesn't meander to the shallow thinking of teens and young adults. It stays true to the script and original story without having a predictable (For the most part) ending tacked on. Here's a story that definitely is not what it seems. Story starts out with John Cusack as Ed. A limo driver and former police officer that is driving a movie star named Caroline Suzanne (Rebecca DeMornay) but its night and its in the middle of a violent storm and Ed accidently hits a woman in the road. Her husband is fixing a flat and their son Timmy (Bret Loehr) is in the back seat. They drive to a motel and try and use the phone but all the lines are down and the next town is 30 miles away and they cannot drive out because of the flooding. Others soon arrive because of the storm like a prostitute named Paris (Amanda Peet), A young couple who just got married, and a cop named Rhodes (Ray Liotta) who is transporting a prisoner (Jake Busey). They are all stuck and later the prisoner escapes. It doesn't take long before some of the group start popping up murdered or disappeared. Meanwhile, another part of the film has a midnight hearing on a killer who is scheduled to die the next day and his doctor (Alfred Molina) is trying to convince the judge that he is insane and didn't know what he was doing. The film is directed by James Mangold (Heavy, Cop Land, Girl Interrupted) and this is another good effort by him and he's slowly building a pretty impressive resume. I was one of those thinking that I was walking into just another thriller but this film is definitely not that. Instead, as the film unfolds it give you twists and turns that seemingly go into a strange direction until you find out what the real source of the story is. But even when you understand the basis of the story it gives you reasons to think. Fairly clever film is somewhat familiar like a ""Twilight Zone"" episode or maybe something by Brian DePalma so even though it keeps you guessing it dawns on you that similar material has been done like this before. It doesn't detract from this being well directed and shot. The cinematography is well handled with the constant rain being the main source for establishing an effective mood. All the actors are up to the task but its the direction and script that the emphasis should be laid upon. Good effective thriller that has a lot more going for it under the surface."

(Spoilers Throughout)<br/><br/>
Ok, i was a little confused in the beginning, but as the movie progressed, i got it. It just didnt reach my expectations, but its up there! It starts off with this guy writing down stuff he hears on a tape, and then it cuts to the motel. Where the guests begin to arrive.<br/><br/>I really liked how they arrived, i like how it all started with Paris's shoe. I mean if you think about it, something so tiny, started everything! If her shoe hadnt been dropped, the family wouldnt have gotten a flat tire, the driver and actress wouldnt have hit the mom, and that goes for everyone else, they probably wouldnt have been forced to go to the Motel.<br/><br/>
This movie made you feel for the characters. It made you feel sorry for pretty much everyone, the character i could have Re-Cast would be John Cusak's character, nothing against his character, i just didnt like John in this movie. Other than that everyone did a great job with being their ""Personality"" <br/><br/>I was so impressed with the ending, i never saw it coming! I mean i never would have thought that Timmy was the Killer. I mean he looks so innocent, and then to top it off, you find out that EVERYONE is just a personality inside Malcolm's head. It was just very impressive, i felt kinda cheated by the whole ""Schizo"" thing, but then i got over it, and im happy with the movie, i cant wait to see it again. It was just fantastic, everyone did a superb job with acting, and im just overwhelmed with the movie, it was great.<br/><br/>10/10"

","A decent psychological thriller, but it falls a little short of being really good. It borrows from some excellent sources with some bits of Hitchcock, Agatha Christie, and The Twilight Zone. Unfortunately it's got a bit of slasher film which is what keeps me from recommending it higher. If you can handle some genuinely grotesque scenes and jump cuts galore, the rest of the movie is definitely worth checking out. For that reason, I won't say too much more about it to avoid spoiling any parts of the movie. It's well acted, well directed, and a good story.

","I feel that this movie was excellent.  It is becoming harder and harder to appeal to mainstream audiences.  The movie was a smart flick and did not dumb itself down for the benefit of mindless slasher movie fans.  For many of these people, this fact is the movie's greatest flaw. That is why some can say Identity was excellent only for the first 80 minutes.  It is my belief that it is what comes after that 80 minute mark that makes this movie stand out from the typical Hollywood horror genre.  Although we are presented with another 6th Sense-style kid (which seems to have become part of the 21st Century horror formula), it actually works in this film."

","I cannot express how much I loved ""Identity.""  I have gone to see it three out of the last five nights at the theater.  This movie is truly brilliant in its writing, acting and directing.  I respectfully disagree with other IMDB users who think that the movie tries to do too many things at once.  I believe that this perceived ""multiplicity"" was performed on purpose, to keep the audience off balance.<br/><br/>The first time you see ""Identity"" you may be confused, even after the credits roll.  I know I was.  But this, in my opinion, is the mark of a great movie.  The style of this film reminds me of ""Memento"" and ""The Game"" in that it took multiple viewings for me to fully appreciate it.  I also saw shades of ""12 Monkeys"", but I don't want to go into any spoilers...<br/><br/>John Cusack is fabulous as the burned-out former cop turned limo driver. Ray Liotta turns in a stunning performace as well, as indeed do all of the major actors.  The editing style is intriguing, never leaving you bored for a moment, and the partially non-linear timeline captures one's attention.<br/><br/>To say any more may ruin the movie for those of you yet to see it.

","""As I was going up the stairs, I met a man who wasn't there. He wasn't there again today, I wish I wish he'd go away.""<br/><br/>               -Certain to become a classic quote among horror movies.<br/><br/>Many great things can be said of James Mangold's ""Identity"", but one thing is for sure; hopefully this will inspire future horror films to try something new for a change, which in this case is a clever story. After endless years of such wretched teen horror fare and formulaic retreads, here comes a movie that manages to be both scary and smart. Such films as The Sixth Sense and, more recently, The Ring, have been likewise, but this movie gives both of them a run for their money, big time. It also has what I can easily say is one of the most shocking endings of recent memory. I've seen the movie twice so far, and the ending has stuck with me thus far.<br/><br/>With talent like this involved, you'd figure this movie had to have something going for it. It's not everyday you see actors like John Cusack and Ray Liotta in a project like this. You've got to give them credit because they obviously spotted the cleverness of the script. Had this been your run of the mill scare flick, I'm sure they would've passed. The real standout of the cast is John Hawkes, as the shady motel proprietor. Hawkes, who I remember in bit parts in Rush Hour and The Perfect Storm, can easily be compared to Steve Buscemi, but he provides the best lines in the movie, not to mention the funniest.<br/><br/>As far as the plot goes, I don't want to reveal anything beyond what the trailer and ads have, which was thankfully not a whole lot. In fact, it's one of the best trailers of recent memory because of that. All that needs to be said is that if you're looking to be really frightened by a movie, but don't want to endure the standard cliches, then ""Identity"" is a must see for you. I certainly hope that it will generate massive box office attention before the summer movie invasion, because it truly deserves to be a hit.<br/><br/>**** out of ****"

"johnnyboyz","5","2","7","13 January 2008"," Although well shot and unfolded, the film is too ambiguous and not concrete enough to satisfy the basic of requirements in its genre.
","I can certainly see what writer Michael Cooney and director James Mangold were trying here with Identity; a thriller-come-whodunit set in an isolated motel in the back o' beyond, but to me the end result falls flat and it falls sort of its attempted goal. I think Identity is a refreshing attempt at a genre that, let's face it, has been done close to death with numerous persons all gathering at a required place in order to be picked off one by one.<br/><br/>The characters seemingly doomed in this particular tale to not submit to the usual stereotypes but they manage to take part in and create a series of annoying trends that have you dislike them. I suppose I was expecting characters in the form of: the black guy; the sluttish girl; the sexually active couple, the male of said two-some takes an attraction to the sluttish girl and vice-versa; the wise old character and some sort of stoner in his twenties. For the film not to have this sort of a cast of people was a relief but to have the ensuing story revolving around what we're given owes a lot to characters and their, quite frankly, stupid behaviour at times with people storming out and acting like children despite a killer on the loose. It is not until the authoritarian figure of former cop Ed (Cusack) tells them to stay put, like children at a primary school, until they all settle down.<br/><br/>And then there is the character of Ed; an interesting one at that solely for the reason the twist that this film has revolves around him, but I won't say any more. What I will say revolves around Ed as a character and how the film is told from his point of view. This is no spoiler because the film makes it obvious to any active film watcher watching Identity since the film is told from Ed's point of view. We know this because he has everything a nice guy could have. He's nice, good natured, kind, educated and is involved in practically every scene. When someone is bleeding, he is the one that knows how to stitch them up; when someone dies, he's the one that does the police work and when everything needs to be sorted out and people need to be calmed down and organised, he's there to steady the ship. Ed is so fantastic that he is even able to tell us how much a room at the motel actually costs for one night since it says so on the billboard at the entrance; let that be a clue.<br/><br/>Following the obligatory start this film has during which the phones don't work (obviously) and the electricity fails after a while, the film would have us transported back to a board room where officials argue over weather to execute a mass-murder. The question that I, and probably the film, fail to grasp is: are the events at the hotel even real? Is any of it actually happening and if so, why are we even seeing it? Yes, Identity is sort of a film about stuff that didn't really happen, or did it? This is no Usual Suspects but it so desperately wants to be given a suspected criminal is in a police station telling us all what's what. Regarding the actual killer who you will only know if you read this after having seen the film, I cannot fathom any incentive for said events to happen and said character(s) to do what he/she/it/they did. It just doesn't make sense but then again, it is age old memories of a psycho, isn't it? <br/><br/>On an aesthetical level, Identity works but its narrative and consistency with what's what doesn't make sense. Towards the end of the film, one girl even states that the whole situation is 'like something out of a movie'. Too true as she goes onto state that in 'said movie' people were gathered at a certain place because they all had something in common. Now, providing this person even existed in real life or whether she existed through imagination alone; how the hell do you explain what she actually says actually forming the basis for the film's final act? Either this is incredible sloppy writing where they have rather obviously run out of ideas and are actually using another film to bail them out OR it's a clever piece of writing where the person having a supposed flashback is mixing up a film they might have once seen and using it to carry out the conclusion of the nightmare. This raises two questions: 1. How would a death row inmate be able to recollect a film they MIGHT have seen years ago and be able to adapt it into their own fantasy? 2. What film was it they're thinking of? My guess is 1945's The Spiral Staircase which I saw several months ago but it is a very, very long shot.<br/><br/>Like I said, the person is able to inform us what the motel's rates are. Based on this, it seems they're also able to recollect everything from the colour of the curtains right down to what people were wearing and driving since we're seeing it. But then the argument again surfaces: did any of it even happen? There are enough incidences of reality being broken to suggest it didn't. While Identity isn't an awful film, it is a confusing and an ambiguous one; one that does not have a satisfying enough pay off to warrant a re-watch and one that fails in what it tries to achieve. Not an embarrassment for all involved but one that will get some people rather excited."
"poolandrews","5","2","8","10 January 2008"," Average murder mystery, I guessed two thirds of the ending...
","Identity is set in Nevada late one night during a fierce rainstorm & starts as limo driver Edward Dakota (John Cusack) is driving actress Paris Nevada (Amada Peet) across a remote desert valley, suddenly he runs into a woman named Alice York (Leila Kenzle) who was standing in the highway after her car got a flat tyre. Together with her husband George (John C. McGinley) & young son Timmy (Bret Loehr) they stop at an isolated motel to get some help, there they quickly realise all the roads are flooded & the telephone lines are down & that they will have to wait it out until the morning. Various other assorted people turn up from police officer's to a couple who were recently married, soon after the decapitated head of Paris is found & it becomes clear there is a murderer amongst their number as the dead bodies start to pile up at an alarming rate...<br/><br/>Directed by James Mangold Identity is for the first seventy odd minutes an Agatha Christie style whodunit as various character's are killed off under mysterious circumstances in some sort of isolated location, it has the intrigue, the mystery, the red herrings & story traits one expects from a typical whodunit. I love murder mystery whodunit's, I really do from the likes of classic telly detective show's like Quincy (1977 - 1983) to Columbo (1971 - 2000) to Midsomer Murders & straight out-and-out horror film whodunit's like Scream (1996) & I Know What You Did Last Summer (1997) as well as dozens of imitator's, I have spent many an hour in front of my telly trying to work out who did it, why they did it & how they did it. I don't usually get it right but I usually do have fun trying to figure it out. Anyway, here we have Identity, which is a mixture of horror & straight laced detective drama which when all said & done like any good whodunit stands or falls by the strength of it's twist ending which I personally don't think is that good. It starts off fine, an isolated location, a torrential thunderstorm which strands several people all of whom seem to be hiding things or have hidden agenda's, then the killings begin & it draws you in as you just instinctively want to know who is responsible. So far so good. But then about twenty minutes before it's end Identity turns it's whole story, it's whole plot, all the character's & literally everything that has happened to that point on it's head with a frustrating twist which I didn't like. I understood it but I just didn't like it. In my opinion this twist cheapens everything that has happened before, it ruins the story & makes it almost pointless. Also I have to say that I guessed who the killer was, I was sat there watching Identity & thought who would the makers feel was the least likely person to have done it & went for them & I was totally right! Not why 'they' actually did it or how 'they' did it but I guessed their identity within twenty minutes. I also anticipated the plot twist involving another character exactly which didn't help matters since apart from one huge twist I pretty much had Identity figured out. Also, was the body of the dead motel owner ever explained? The eventual killer couldn't have possibly killed him...<br/><br/>Director Mangold does alright, there's a decent atmosphere, there's some tension & one or two jump out of your seat scare moments as well. It's just a shame about the twist which I honestly didn't think worked, it made sense & I have no complaints there but I was just expecting more & the murder mystery side of things was too predictable for me although I'm not saying for one moment everyone who watches it will figure it out because I'm sure lots won't. There's a decapitated head in a tumble dryer but otherwise not much gore & the murders happen off screen.<br/><br/>With a supposed budget of about $30,000,000 which sounds a hell of a lot of money to me, I thought it was one of those low budget films which relied on some sort of extreme plot twist to gain attention but 30 big ones puts this up there as a pretty big budget Hollywood flick. There's good cast here including John Cusack, Ray Liotta, Alfred Molina, Jake Busey & Rebecca De Mornay who all put in good performances.<br/><br/>Identity is a good murder mystery for seventy odd minutes but then sort of collapses in a really hard to swallow twist ending which for me ruined everything that had happened before it. The killer is too obvious as well. Good & an interesting film to watch once but I doubt I'll ever want to watch it again & I certainly couldn't recommend it."
"djmbusiness","2","2","8","18 July 2006"," Fairly well acted but poor vehicle.
","Highly disappointing, the only suspense is the order in which characters are affected. The premise stems from a psychological concept still debated by the industry and only stands up within the film itself as a dramatic device. Acting is better than adequate; one surprise is the all-too-brief portrayal by Rebecca DeMornay. (You might never guess it was she had you not found her name in the credits.) Cusak is creditable for holding his character's tension throughout the feature. Few modern films get by using a single set, but this one does, though the set is ""extended."" Consider this feature as a way to kill ninety minutes or so before something more important comes along; if one can suspend one's disbelief, the film can satisfy."
"antiwalkerthest","5","1","3","29 July 2019"," Good until the third and final act.
","This was a genuinely decent film for the first two acts. There was suspense, there was an omnipresent sense of mystery, the plot twists were nicely thought out and the characters were good enough to make me care about what was gonna happen to them and what would eventually happen to them. Even though it did feel formulaic and kinda cliched because there have been plenty of movies in the past with similar concepts to Identity, it was all easily overlooked thanks to its excellent execution.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, that's where it stops being good. By the time we reached the final act, it went downhill really fast. As soon as one grand plot twist presented itself to the viewer, another plot twist that was twice as grand as the previous twist was shown. And then it did it again. And again and again.<br/><br/>Usually, I don't have a problem with movies that have quite a few too many plot twists so long as they maintain the sense that whoever is writing it is competent enough to handle its story, but when you bombard the viewer with a ridiculous number of plot twists that the story becomes too convoluted to properly follow, then that's the point of when you should realize that you're doing something totally wrong, but this movie didn't get the memo.<br/><br/>Instead, it continued to move right ahead to inject even more plot twists trying to out think itself that it backfired as a result. What we got in the end was an overblown movie that got so gluttonous that it consumed more calories than it could handle, only to vomit away all of its food as punishment for eating way too much.<br/><br/>For all of its merits that this movie had, there were an equal number of blemishes that balanced out its merits to create what I'd consider an average movie. It's too bad, really. If the third act didn't stray away from what the movie was trying to do with its first two acts, then maybe it would've been decent because that's what I certainly thought it was going to be."

That's all I will say for it because it was so convoluted that honestly who wants to expend that many brain cells trying to figure out something that you are partaking in specifically to NOT think. I just want to be entertained. I'm not trying to figure out a bunch of plot twists. <br/><br/>What I will say is this - it's great to go back to see films of movie stars who are older now simply to see how time has ravaged their face. I would say everyone (even Jake Busey who on his best day is hard to look at) was at their prime in this film as far as looks go. Look any of them up now and most of them are straight busted. That's gotta be so hard to see yourself onscreen looking amazing and then looking in the mirror and seeing how old you've become. So glad I'm not in film."

"shannen-l-c","9","1","3","25 February 2018"," Phenomenal mind-bending thriller that will have you on the edge of your seat
","This movie came recommended to me on Netflix spotlight since I watch so many thrillers/horrors, so I decided to give it a try and was blown away. You may think you know exactly what's going on and exactly what the movie is about, but you cannot predict the direction in which the story is headed until its revealed. <br/><br/>First of all, I should point out that although 'Identity' is headed under the horror section on Netflix UK, it's definitely not a horror and although it's very suspenseful, the blood/gore is minimal and it's much more of a psychological thriller than anything else. So for any horror fans looking for a true horror, this may not be for you. However, if you're a fan of mind-bending psychological thrillers with a splash of the slasher sub-genre, this is perfect for you. <br/><br/>'Identity' is such a well thought out story that benefits from a talented cast, interesting characters and an intriguing story that is much more complex than it seems on first appearances. Unlike many other movies in the same genre, 'Identity' doesn't extend beyond its reach by throwing unnecessary twists and surprises that are illogical and irrelevant to the overall conclusion. Although the story is complex, every single piece of the puzzle fits together perfectly leaving no unanswered questions or lingering confusion. <br/><br/>John Cusak is fantastic as the lead (no surprises there), but the entire cast is strong and give great performances. The characters themselves all had their own personalities and we were introduced to elements of their back-story which made them feel more distinctive as people instead of just a bunch of generic murder victims. The interactions between the characters are equally as strong and there's interesting dynamics that emerge between them immediately. Personally, I was a little confused as to how some of them seemed so familiar to each other so quickly, but just like everything else, it's all explained as the story progresses. <br/><br/>I loved the way the twists were revealed because it was done at the perfect time and in a way whereby it was subtle and had you thinking for a few moments longer about what you were being told. But the second the dots connect it evokes an immediate response of awe and surprise. I also appreciated that the story still continued to develop further and progress at a steady pace after the reveal. <br/><br/>Overall, this is a fantastic movie that is psychologically stimulating, clever and suspenseful and will have anybody that watches on the edge of their seat guessing what's going to happen next and who the big bad is. The best part is that very few people will figure it out by themselves, because it's THAT unexpected, yet when you know it you can't help but wonder how you didn't see it from the beginning."
"valadas","5","1","3","28 May 2016"," Very stupid movie
","And too ambitious and ridiculously pretentious. A stormy night assembles a lot of characters in a motel: a couple and their kid, a driver who has knocked down this couple's wife, a girl who is traveling to work in an orange garden, a policeman who is taking a handcuffed convicted killer who was about to be executed but whose lawyer has managed to get a judge's reevaluation of the case on the ground of his mental insanity and a young couple recently married. Add to them the motel manager, a young man not very convincing. This leads to a lot of murders that keep occurring successively. There is a permanent heavy rain outside and since the characters keep walking in and out they are wet to the skin. To this succession of not so explicable events a fanciful imaginary nonsense psychiatric explanation is invented and forced in the end through a succession of unconvincing images. To watch this movie is a sheer waste of time."

We spent the rest of the movie basically waiting for the scenarios we had described to play out, which they duly did. It's not terrible, it just doesn't have anything in particular to recommend it. A shame really as John Cusack is usually worth a watch, and I personally enjoy Ray Liotta's performances. Sadly, here, they were at best clichéd and at worst without depth to their characters. We found it hard to care what happened to any of the cast as they were either unlikeable with no redeeming features or absolutely pointless. The makers also decided that sticking the wonderful Alfred Molina behind a desk and barely giving him anything to say or do was a great idea; what a waste of a real talent. The storyline had potential but somebody decided not to go with that and to make a predictable, plodding, barely above a B-movie effort instead."

A must & compelling watch. The character 'Ed' is one of the most different characters ever. One just cannot miss this movie. It is right up there with the very best.

I was really ticked off, what a cop out, and there was still a long way to go, what were they going to do now that the ""twist"" was revealed? By the end of the movie, I was blown away by the way the twist is used as an opportunity to say some serious things about identity and self awareness. The root of Greek tragedy from the Iliad on is the subjectivity of self knowledge and this movie has stayed with me. A second watching is worth it just to see how well the twist is played with before it is revealed.<br/><br/>I haven't seen that many John Cusack movies, but I haven't seen one that wasn't good, and this is the best so far."
"auchitya","9","1","3","22 March 2014"," A little ending mistake
","I refrain myself from posting reviews but my understanding of the feature compelled me to do this. It is a very great movie, well structured, continuous and well hinted. The thing which I find a little too much is its ending. The makers should have refrained themselves from adding a scene showing the triumph of the Child's personality over Paris's. There is nothing bad with it. But this scene, in my view, puts the movie in a weird situation. After successfully conveying the idea of movie it could have easily ended for good. The death of Paris conveys the failure of everything. Accidental failure of justice, failure of personality, failure of sacrifice and failure of an otherwise great movie. In my opinion a preferable end, if any dramatic scenario was at all required, would have been death of all personalities Malcolm has created and subsequent brain death of him. This could have reaffirmed the idea of the movie and would have contrasted everything the movie needed to project."

","Everyone likes twist endings. Everyone likes mysteries. If you agree with the previous two statements, then Identity should be the next movie you watch.<br/><br/>Riddled with amazing performances and character building, Identity starts off dull. Then, it tells the story of 10 people who get stranded in a motel perfectly through co-incidence and while the camera flashes the cause of events, you'll give it a wry smile. What unfolds is a series of mystery-filled occurrences which are enough to keep you hooked. The scientific/medical approach also polishes it and moreover paints the errors off the plot which mainly focuses on crime- investigation. Jaw-dropping bloody sequences & few deep dialogs makes me rate it 8.2/10!<br/><br/>I agree the conclusion is kinda hard to understand, but if you look closely, there is a 1:3 chance that you can predict what is what. But that'll make heavy concentration, coupled with appeal.

"lukaszsw","5","1","3","6 May 2011"," If nothing is what it seems why care?
","I understand why many people like this movie but I couldn't stand it! The Story is 10 strangers are stranded in a motel during a heavy rainstorm and they are killed why by one. The other scene is in the court house with judge, prosecutors, defense an a psychiatrist wait for a convict to arrive because there is some new evidence in his case and his presence is needed. Later, and this isn't really a spoiler, people get killed but who is the killer? Who will manage to survive? The problem is that this movie behaves a little like the ""Lost"" series, each new revelation seems disjointed from the rest and not making sense. It is so in your face, like the movie is saying ""ha ha, I've got you"".<br/><br/>So after a while I completely lost interest after a fifth plot twist. See, I don't really consider it enjoyable when I am told that I will be fooled and than anticipating it. Sixth Sense was great because most people didn't see it coming, in ""Identity"" you are tossed a bone and expected to find it but it is not a fair struggle with movie toying with you.<br/><br/>Having that said acting is superb, John Cusack and Ray Liotta are great.<br/><br/>Robert Ebert wrote that the movie is a rarity not having a formulatic third act. Today (when I finally got to see it) I'd say the movie is formulatic in the exact sense that it doesn't want to be and ends up being it. ""A follower in reverse"" (-Bjarke Ingels)"
"digitald-4","10","1","3","17 September 2010"," A Superb Movie
","In order to establish a point of reference for this movie, here are some movies I consider excellent. Right off the top... <br/><br/>Recently: Identity, Thin Red Line, Little Miss Sunshine, When Trumpets Fade, Charlie Wilsons War (revealing), Inside John Malkovich, The village, Inception (a good movie owing to the subject matter but not for the film itself or the acting).. and many more not mentioned here.<br/><br/>Older movies: Hell in the Pacific (a must see), Dangerous Liasons, Apocalypse Now, Platoon, And Justice for All, Dog day in the afternoon, Serpico, The killing fields, etc.<br/><br/>Anyway, about this movie ""Identity"", I've seen it many times. At times I shut off the video to listen to the soundtrack in the background while I work on other stuff to try and find ""the"" connection between whats happening in the movie and what's happening underneath my conscious reality - as I perceive it. Am I inferring I might have MPD and am unaware of it? No. In that there is no loss of time rules that out. Still, that is not to say there are distinct ""other"" personalities lurking within that have a logic all their own: Because They are there. Freuds very relevant work in the field of psychology (not psychiatry) which was later made accessible in the book ""Im OK you're OK"" by Dr. Thomas Harris - makes this fact amply clear. <br/><br/>Still, going a bit beyond Freuds precepts or those made evident thru Transactional Analysis there is this other exceptionally neat idea (reality more like) of roles assigned to us by society or as Jung would put ""the collective consciousness"" by a guy John Bradshaw in his book ""healing the shame that binds you"". But why bring this up? What do the principles or ideas in these books have to do with movie ""identity"" - Everything! There is a key here - a key to a door. A Door that leads to maybe, just maybe, a truer self? The movie identity forces me to ask questions like these and in doing its function is fulfilled.<br/><br/>Assuming we are all acting at all times (like so-called normal people do and will continue to do) and living out these roles assigned to us by the mass consciousness, what does that say about us? Does the fact that we are all questionably ""LIVING"" out these assembled roles and identities not lead to a higher question of our validity? Are we real or not... Doggoneit? More to point are we even alive or Yikes! manifestations of Virtual Reality? Could that be called life? Still, whether it is it's intention or not, the co-efficient of 'identity' is one big looming question; Are YOU really YOU? If you are not you.. are you not then in reality a FRankenstein? Yes! Absolutely Yes! So I have a look at 'identity' now and then because (with the innocence of a child) it hands me a mirror and says ""wanna have a look?""."
"centaur84-650-156428","8","1","3","2 February 2010"," Near Perfect Psychological Thriller
","Identity has been compared to many films like Fight Club, Saw and even Sixth Sense because of the twist-ending. But that's where the similarities end.<br/><br/>Identity is a psychological thriller and by my understanding of the genre, such movies engage the audience by having them intelligently guess who the villain is while distracting them with several twists in the plot. And Identity does that brilliantly.<br/><br/>The story is written in your typical 'whodunnit' fashion. A bunch of strangers from different places, leading different lives, get stranded in a motel for the night, no thanks to the convenient timing of torrential downpour. Predictably they get murdered one by one in gruesome manner until the killer is finally found and stopped. Or so you think.<br/><br/>Identity is a movie that plays heavily on character development, which to me is something that lacks in modern thrillers. The well-timed flashbacks satisfy the audience's need to know how the strangers ended up in the same place at the same time and the dialog between characters build chemistry. The cast do a great job of keeping the tension by balancing sympathy and suspicion.<br/><br/>The movie's twist at the end is fitting. After taunting you for so long the twist is near perfect for those who like their movies with a reasonable explanation of events. All the movie's clichÃ©s are immediately forgiven and forgotten.<br/><br/>Identity may not be an all-time classic but it doesn't deserve the negative remarks from some reviewers. It is a well-thought out movie that pays attention to detail and makes a sincere effort to end the film as a realistically as possible.<br/><br/>Identity is NOT a horror movie as some seem to think although the movie does fool audience into thinking there is some sort of supernatural force at work in the beginning.<br/><br/>Saying too much in a review may just give away the numerous twists in the movie so I urge you to just watch it. Give it a try and you may thank yourself for not missing out on one the genre's best. <br/><br/>I would recommend this movie to those who enjoyed Seven and The Prestige."
"grandfunkfan","8","1","3","31 January 2010"," Entertaining throughout
","The movie IDENTITY is simply entertaining throughout. Not once during my viewing did I think of fast-forwarding to the next scene or chapter. I actually replayed some scenes to try and solve the mystery, but I was unsuccessful.<br/><br/>To paraphrase another review, ""There are many, many opportunities for you to name the bad guy, but you will probably be wrong."" All of the actors did an excellent job of portraying their characters, even to the point of being annoying or irritating.<br/><br/>There are several clues that things aren't normal, bloodstains on one cop's back, the convict escaping the scene only to arrive again, but these clues don't give the answer to who is the bad guy. Ultimately, I'm not sure the conclusion really explained who the bad guy was, but not in the style of some cheap movie setting up a sequel. IDENTITY was final. It was simply an entertaining, attention-keeping movie."

","The rains of mystery are falling hard, and innocence is shattered. And the cold touch of murder digs in deep, and intricate lines are drawn together. And nothing is what it seems, and as the storyline twists and turns do we fall deeper and deeper down the rabbit hole. And as the ending begins to rise do the skies finally clear, but the storm is far from over. And memories of characters flooded with life shine through the heart and soul of a powerful cast of actors, and with direction and production are our minds left shaken to its core. And this movie, Identity is a whirlwind that will spin you round and round no matter how many times you continue to watch it."

The ""twist"" if you want to call it that, was right in your face the whole time, but the movie doesn't rely on it. The value of the film doesn't rest on the twist. You become invested in each character, and the fact that they aren't real isn't relevant, since they don't exist anyway. The film was multi layered and really needed to be viewed from an open mind willing to dig for all the little bits and pieces of treasure left out for the taking. If you're willing to make an investment of time, and pay attention, this movie is a really exciting ride! If you're just looking for something to put on while you're half invested in something else, put your TV on C-Span or MTV."

It follows stranded strangers brought together at an old hotel in the middle of a savage rainstorm, but relief is quickly replaced with fear as they start to die one by one... At the same time we learn there is a prison transport heading to midnight hearing...but how is that involved in all this? It is just one of the many twists and turns in Identity. Acting is top notch here with some good performances from John Cusack, Ray Liotta, Amanda Peet, and Rebecca DeMornay. The death scene's are good, some of camera and some are on, but there isn't to much gore...just the right amount.

The editing is excellent - though it gets a little flaccid in the last 15 minutes or so (and so a vote of 9 rather than 10). The acting is excellent. I could definitely enjoy watching this again. Once you've understood what the story is about then there really is only one 'person' who could be the real perpetrator - but the beauty of the film is that it works just like a nightmare (as the viewer you are on the inside taking it all as real)."

The end however is a mind f-ck like no other. The last time I felt as completely blown away by a completely unexpected twist ending was ""the game"" with Michael Douglas. Identity will squeeze, twist, confuse and excite your brain all at once until finally you sit, staring at the screen of credits, speechless thinking to yourself: ""oh my god -- what the heck just happened."" Unpredictable, highly suspenseful and will blow your mind.

","Every week, I read two movie magazines. When it comes to new movies, they mostly agree in their reviews. Except for Identity! One magazine said it was really good and filled with pleasant surprises. The other one said it was dull and rather predictable. This really meant I HAD to see this one. I finally did now and I must say I tend to agree with both my magazines. It sure had its predictable moments but that didn't spoil the fun for me. And it's one of the best ensemble casts I've ever seen. <br/><br/>SPOILERS MAY APPEAR FROM HERE!!!! WATCH OUT WHAT YOU READ !!!<br/><br/>Now, this is hard to explain but Identity is predictable while it's surprising. The whole ""motel-mystery"" has its flaws and it's overall predictable indeed. But inside this story, there are still a few pleasant surprises to discover. SUPER SPOILERS HERE!!! Come on, of all people who claim they saw right through the plot...who can honestly say they suspected Ray Liotta to be an escaped villain ?? Or that Larry wasn't the real motel owner ?? END SUPER SPOILERS ! ( still small spoilers, though ) All people who claimed they fully figured this movie out after half an hour are lying. Even if they did have a good idea about the motel thing ( as did I, by the way ), I suspect they were still stunned by the whole wraparound story. You have to be pretty psycho yourself if you understood this from the beginning. So, in general, a very good story and a nice change in the average supernatural thrillers we get nowadays. END SPOILERS !!!<br/><br/>Now for my favorite part of Identity. The flawless cast. Allow me to start with the side characters which were still played by known and very decent actors. John C. McGinley for example. Ever since Platoon and Wall Street I thought this guy was a very good actor but he never seemed to broke through. That's a shame because he truely is underrated. Clea DuVall is also in this movie. Whatever happened to her? I really thought she would become a great actress real soon but she still has to be satisfied with smaller roles. She isn't really cute but she's a damn good actress. One of the best in her young generation. Jake Busey is always a pleasure to watch. He sort of repeats the role he had in the Frighteners and this fits him very well. The leading actors are just great. Ray Liotta has always been a favorite of mine he proved again that he is worth this status. Never a bad word about John Cusack neither. He's outstanding as usual. In fact, I think it's his third best role next to Pushing Tin and Grosse Point Blank. I enjoyed Con Air as well, but I hope he never tries to be an action hero again. Intelligent comedies or psychological stories fit him better, in my opinion. I don't really care for Amanda Peet, but I guess she did a good job. At least, she was less annoying than in The Whole Nine Yards.<br/><br/>The whole setting reminded me of Alfred Hitchkock's masterpiece PSYCHO. Only this manager is more funny than Norman Bates. Psycho proved that it's possible to create a unique atmosphere in an abandoned motel but furthermore there are few relations between these two movies. The constant rain contributes as well to this great setting. Well made, more than enough suspense, great acting and tones of creepy sequences. That's really all I can say about it. Oh, I can say I fully figured out the Sixth Sense when I first saw that one but NOT Identity...I guess that's a good sign."
"MisterMovieMan","4","1","3","2 May 2003"," This is the only review you should read.
","Identity?  Who is who or what(?!), not so much who is the killer.  I will not give away any of this film or run pointlessly through every scene like other people who review movies on this site will do so read on...<br/><br/>You can say this movie is over-cliched with horror elements like other reviewers have stated, but it is quite intentional and that is the best part of this film.  It's typical slasher setups and scenes are well designed for scares and/or suspense and you will find yourself engrossed in the first half of this film.  The direction and well crafted scenes are good enough here to blend suspense and confusion into good entertainment.<br/><br/>To all those who claim this movie is only for ""intelligent"" viewers please don't write another review ever again. Scenes in the first half of this film may be standard to modern horror but because of the acting talent of most of it's stars, it comes off far better than many films of this genre.  But when it comes time to blend all of this films confusion and mystery with a meaningful, satisfying resolution it falls flat.  You may be surprised, but if you don't feel had, you weren't really paying attention. So all of you who claim this to be a highly intelligent psychological thriller, you apparently don't realize the writer of this was also responsible for Jack Frost and its sequel.  It must have been about time for him to create the next thriller/surprise film and try to break into the money-making theatrical market.<br/><br/>James Mangold is not without talent and he tries terribly to make this bad script work and it may have, if only he treated it less seriously.  The disorder you will see in Identity is turned cartoon-ish by Hollywood yet again here and if you are a Psychology major like one reviewer here claimed, you shouldn't be thrilled by this film but insulted.  It's only there for the surprise not coherency.  We don't actually know anything about the surprise character either, so when the story turns down a different road it doesn't really work and destroys everything there was good about the movie (unless of course your mind is too locked in ""WOW - I - AM - SUR-PRISED"" mode).  The other plot twist is predictable if you are used to ""who-dun-it horror"" and  ridiculous as well in flashback scenes shown near the film's climax.<br/><br/>Cusak turns in an expected good performance here.  Liotta plays another defiant/angry character as he usually does these days but still remains beleiveable and the remaining members of the cast do a good job as well except...<br/><br/>Amanda Peet is not a great actress.  Please don't base your review on whether someone is cute or not - it's insulting to those who know and appreciate good filmmaking.  Go watch Blind Date.  She should stick to bad comedies because when she acts out any real emotions in this film it's usually unintentionally funny. Nevertheless she wasn't as terrible as I expected she would be. Pruitt Taylor Vince was clearly miscast but since his character was poorly underwritten as well it didn't matter.  His performance was barely acceptable.<br/><br/>Identity is not a total waste.  In fact, it is an improvement over many recent horror outings of the past few months (if I mentioned any of them I'd be too scared someone would respond that they were actually good) though it could be skipped without loss just as well.  See it merely to be entertained, but don't think about it too long to the point of delusion or you'll make it into a masterpiece (like others here have) which it clearly is not. ** out of ****."

","James Mangold is an interesting director to watch if he has the right material to work with. This film, as written by Michael Cooney, who is really the less talented  of the Kaufman brothers, as we saw in Adaptation, is not for the faint hearted.<br/><br/>There are enough gory details to keep the viewer at the end of his seat wondering what new whacky twist will happen next. To say that it is confusing to the average person, is to put it mildly. Perhaps, as some writers to this forum have expressed, it might be better on a second, or maybe a third viewing since most clues fly over our heads not knowing what to make of the many ""personalities""  a person can have and be at the same place, at the same time. Watch out for the Ides of May!<br/><br/>Any film with Ray Liotta and John Cusack will be worth the price of admission. They always deliver. Both are in top form here, even though they might even share the same personality. <br/><br/>The rest of the cast was good too. It was a surprise to see Rebeca De Mornay in the very brief role of the egotistical actress who doesn't get a chance to star in her next film....The only thing missing was the limited presence of Taylor Pruitt Vince, who has appeared in other Mangold directed films and has nothing to in this one."

An incredible ensemble cast--Liotta, Peet, Cusack and Busey give quality performances.<br/><br/>The basic premise of the story is novel and entertaining, however the way the story is scripted towards the end is disappointing.  The overdone ""sunny fields"" to cheesey ""Children of the Corn""-esque ending ruined this for me.<br/><br/>
We knew Liotta's character was no good from seeing his back early in the movie, but I think they overplayed the whodunit shifting a little too much during the course of the movie.<br/><br/>Again, the concept was good, just not carried to fruition.  I think that this is a case where a veteran production team (Wes Craven, etc) could have ironed out the kinks and made this a top 10 all-time horror flick.<br/><br/>

","Greetings again from the darkness.  Highly anticipated ""thriller"" that for the most part, fails to deliver.  More slasher than thriller.  The psychological aspect held great promise and intrigue, but was handled poorly.  Director James Mangold continues with his run of disappointing films, including ""Kate & Leopold"", ""Girl, Interrupted"" and ""Cop Land"".  He does have some visual style, but lacks the ability to add substance to his work.  Cusack and Liotta are strong in their roles, and Amanda Peet is surprisingly effective as the young dreamer.  The always great Alfred Molina provides excellent work in relief, and an almost unrecognizable Rebecca DeMornay has a quick turn as a a woman who ""used to be that actress"".  Gotta love those that can poke fun at themselves.  Speaking of fun, many of the death scenes generate outloud laughter from the audience due to the unbelievable nature.  Overall this film steals from the best - Psycho, The Omen, The Sixth Sense, Carrie, The Fury and Ten Little Indians.  The problem is those were all very strong scripts that were filmed brilliantly, whereas ""Identity"" seems to avoid the one topic that could have provided the film with its own 'identity'.  Focus on the internal battle of personalities could have been the key to setting this one apart.  Instead, it is just another slasher with a nice cast."

Nope, ya can't do that -- we're not playing by those rules -- ha ha gottcha)<br/><br/>Keep in mind that I also hated ""American Beauty"" (Yeh, Dad should be delighted that his daughter is dating the drug dealer next door), ""The Fugitive"" (Uh oh, nothing has happened for a while, lets flash a bloody knife stabbing the air to keep them awake -- or maybe put the camera in a chopper and fly over the edge of something really high) and ""Shakespeare in Love"" (See how I have this camera dolly?

","Looking back on this (""Identity"" is a movie that requires the dust to settle, first), I can respect the goal of this movie to move from whodunnit to mindscrew psycho thriller. And back when it first came out, I was a lot more engaged by the big reveal at the end than I am today. For a while, I wasn't sure if the problem was a bad script or just that it doesn't hold up on rewatch. It's the script.<br/><br/>It's got good ideas, they're just poorly executed. People die off in the most contrived ways (you know how it is: you may not have seen a death coming, but you feel cheated after it happens). And that big ending twist only really works if you're just passively watching. Any scrutiny is bound to leave you frustrated. This certainly isn't my favorite John Cusack movie, although he does carry it.<br/><br/>5/10"
"alishahmohd","4","1","4","3 August 2014"," The last act ruins what could have been a good film.
","The Identity had a a lot of good things going for it and before I watched it I expected a good suspense/thriller film. First of all John Cusack was in this film and he always puts on good performances in the roles that he is given, he carried the above average horror flick 1408, and made it so much more entertaining and fun to watch with his enthusiastic performance. Identity had John Cusack and also had a large cast of other actors many of which I did not know of. But the basic plot at the premise of the whole film was very appealing. I was expecting something good in the very least. <br/><br/>Movie was going in the right direction, not only Cusack but rest of the cast performed well, and the settings and environments seemed appealing and the film was only getting better by the minute, until the last 1/4 portion of the movie where the big twist was revealed.<br/><br/>Now don't get me wrong twists are not bad, sometimes they up the status of the film and may make you come back for a second viewing, leave you shocked and leave room for interpretations. Another psychological horror/thriller Sixth Sense had a great twist; another suspense/thriller film like Usual Suspects had a great twist. The Others a horror film also had a great twist. But this film goes with the terrible it was all a dream concept which ruins all the interesting characters this film was trying to make us care about throughout most of the it. This Dream concept can work if executed right but here this concept ruins everything. We come to the realization that it all in the head of a mentally unstable serial killer who has multiple personalities in his brain, each of which is portrayed by the characters in the movie, the serial killer personality is the killing off the other characters (personalities) which represent something good in the killer or a softer side to him.<br/><br/>I don't see this as an intelligent concept because it's premise is flawed from the start, personalities co-exist in the brain they don't try to kill each other off as portrayed in the movie, neither they are numbered in a specific order as portrayed in the movie. I thought the film was heading somewhere interesting when we found out all characters had the same birth date and had last names of countries or cities, but apparently all this was to present them as a personality in a psychopath's head. <br/><br/>Plus it's laughable who turns out to be the killer/evil personality at the end. We do agree to suspend our disbelief to a point when watching film but this is just unbelievable, I guess they just wanted to SHOCK us by revealing the kid as the killer, they decided to make the whole scenario take place in a psychopath's head to pass off the possibility of the kid as a killer just to SHOCK us. I wrote off the kid as a suspect the second I saw him just like anyone would, because which movie is ridiculous enough to portray a little child as a Serial Killer? I don't see how is this intelligent in anyway, it is nonsensical, ruins the characters and ruins the suspense the movie had. Why should we care Cusack's character left his police job, why should we care about the Detective being a prisoner disguised as a cop, why care about the problems the couple was having , why care about that women's condition after the car accident. Why should we care about a psychopath guy who appears for like 5 minutes in the movie and what happens in his head and why should we care about what is happening in the head of a serial killer in the first place. Why care about anything at all. This twist ruins the whole thing and reveals that caring about anything related to the backstory of the characters is pointless and is not real and represents something in the psychopath's head.<br/><br/>Overall, Identity had a good basic premise, good performances and a good setting , and was only getting better but it will all ruined by the film's twist, which ruins everything this film established in its first half. <br/><br/>Overall Rating: 4/10."

","Good, but not great. Started off quite lamely, and seemed like it was just going to be another average slasher-whodunit-thriller. However, the first twist made it into an interesting psychological drama. This twist was not enough to sustain the movie though, and the second twist just seemed gratuitous, for the sake of a climactic ending.<br/><br/>Reasonably entertaining and intriguing though, despite all its faults.<br/><br/>Performances are so-so. Amanda Peet is about the only actor/actress that shines. John Cusack and Ray Liotta should be the stars but just seem like they're trying too hard. John C McGinley is irritating in his role - he should stick to comedy."

"mnpollio","4","1","4","15 April 2011"," Initially promising thriller whose tension sputters out at the midway point
","A textbook case of something that probably sounded daring and more entertaining on paper than it does in execution. Identity is initially an update on Agatha Christie's And Then There Were None. A legion of diverse characters become stranded in a storm at an isolated desert motel, where one by one they are picked off by someone (or something).<br/><br/>The story is not new, but it is most definitely reliable. The atmosphere is tense, there is a definite sense of dread surrounding the proceedings. An ace cast has been compiled to inhabit the roles of the prospective victims and the screenplay throws in some twists, like all of the people discovering they were born on the same day or everyone's last name is a state. Tidbits which definitely perk the interest and make one wonder whether there is not a supernatural or metaphysical element going on. Meanwhile, a subplot is concurrently running concerning a schizophrenic murderer (Pruit Taylor Vince) and his concerned physician (Alfred Molina). Is Vince the perpetrator behind the killings? Are we seeing something that has already happened being told in flashback? <br/><br/>Unfortunately, the screenplay has one twist that comes right around the midway mark that utterly annihilated any further suspense or rooting interest that one has in the film. The viewer is then left with a healthy expanse of dead space that becomes more tedious and illogical with each passing moment. The writers/director probably thought this novel twist was monumental, but it actually shoots the film in the foot. It is predicated on the fact that we MUST have some sympathy with the institutionalized killer - a character that is marginal at best up to that point in the film. It is completely wrong though. The viewer's sympathy and interest lie with the people back at the motel, and by robbing the main plot of any reason to become emotionally involved, the film renders itself pointless.<br/><br/>There are good performances about. John Cusack is a solid and likable leading man. Ray Liotta trots out his familiar tough guy shtick to good advantage. Amanda Peet is a lively leading lady, although why everyone in the film is able to immediately peg her as a prostitute when she is dressed more demurely than Rebecca DeMornay's shrewish actress is beyond me. Speaking of DeMornay, it would have been nice to keep her character around a bit longer. The remainder of the cast is comprised of familiar and perfectly reliable performers like Clea Duvall, John Hawkes, John C. McGinley, etc. In fact, the two fuzziest and least involving characters are the ones portrayed by Vince and Molina - and when the film drops on us that this is where our attention should be focused and our involvement lies, it is near impossible to remain engaged any further.<br/><br/>The latter third of the film - utterly devoid of tension despite increasing noise and hysteria - seems to go on forever. The film then, of course, attaches on a coda that leaves the door open for a possible sequel. The ""shock"" revelation of the ""person"" behind the murders at the hotel will not be much of a shock to attentive viewers or those at all familiar with thrillers in general. Unfortunately, the truth is that it really makes no difference who the ""killer"" at the hotel is and that is what stops the film in its tracks. Definitely an A for ambitious, but a C- for the end result."

You really get invested in the characters. And this film plays around differently than other thrillers. It requires full attention, since it has so many twists and turns. By the time the ending comes, you won't be able to stop talking about. It is carried on with such a well revelation. What helps also is that the original music score is so chilling.

","""Identity"" starts off telling the separate stories of ten strangers who coincidentally wind up stranded in the Nevada desert during a torrential rainstorm. Among them are a limo driver, a snobby actress, a police detective transporting a convict, a married couple and their young son, a prostitute, and many other assorted characters who happen to be in the same situation. They all, oddly enough, end up at a small little vacant motel in the desert to escape from the rainstorm, among them being the wife of the married couple who was hit by a car and severely injured. As the night goes on and the strangers begin to know each other a little better, someone begins killing them off one by one. They begin to suspect the convict is responsible for the brutal slayings, but the murders continue throughout the night and each of the strangers learn that they all hold a mysterious secret...<br/><br/>I don't want to give to much of the plot away so that's all I'll tell you, but trust me, you won't be disappointed with this film. I saw this movie back during it's theater release a few years ago, and I was blown away by it all. It's really a great film - not just a great horror film, but just as a film in general. The story to this film is amazing, I have to give some serious credit to the writers because it was so well done. This has to be one of the most original films of it's type, and for that it succeeds very well with me. As the film progresses toward the shocking conclusion, pieces of the puzzle begin to come together in a way that you wouldn't have even imagined before. There were some really scary sequences in the film also that were very well-directed, especially the bathroom attack on the Ginny character - scared the hell out of me. The performances in the film were also excellent, and the film boasts a fairly impressive cast - among them being John Cusack, Ray Liotta, Amanda Peet, Alfred Molina, Clea DuVall, Rebecca DeMornay, and others. Each of the performances were great, the cast was perfect and played their characters very well.<br/><br/>The setting for this movie was perfect - the small, cheap little motel is a perfect backdrop for all of the gruesome happenings. In fact, it reminded me a little of the infamous Bates Motel in Hitchock's classic ""Psycho"", the similarities being that the motel was in the desert and the overall layout of it all. Is it a reference to ""Psycho""? Possibly, I can't really say for sure though. Along with the all of the pluses mentioned above, the cinematography was really excellent, the film was shot very stylishly. Everything was very washed down, dark, and ominous, a perfect manner for this film to be presented in, giving it a much more mysterious feel. <br/><br/>The bottom line is, ""Identity"" is one of the smartest, cleverly constructed horror/thrillers in quite some time. It was creepy, mysterious, had me wondering throughout the entire movie, and the conclusion that tied everything together was a real shocker. Definitely give it a look, you'll be pleasantly surprised. 9/10."

","Horribly predictable attempt at a who-dunnit.  The story had potential and could have had a decent ending, but the creators must have decided that to try to reduce the chance of predicting the ending, they would use cheap tricks and intentionally omit vital information.  After hearing (as stated in the promos) that 10 people are stranded together and are being killed one-by-one, the first thing that should come to mind is Agatha Christie's ""And Then There Were None,"" otherwise called ""Ten Little Indians."" Instead of crediting this masterful work, the movie references a cheaply done (though moderately enjoyable) mini-series from the '80s based on the book. A sign of a poor mystery is when vital information or characters are introduced late in the story for the sole purpose of misleading the viewer and making it theoretically impossible to know who-dunnit.

And then a final little twist about which of the personalities was the actual killer. Like anyone cares ... It reminds me of Nicholas Cage's character in ""Adaptation"" panning his twin brother's screenplay ""The 3"" - to paraphrase: ""You mean the cop, the killer, and the girl are all the same character?!"" Summary: The acting is fairly good, as is the cinematography (the director does dark, rainy nights as good as anyone) but ""Identity"" is a ludicrous and very bad movie. A big disappointment.

I found myself wondering why fine actors like John Cusack and Ray Liotta would star in something like this, but I guess it was a job.<br/><br/>Although the film's story line doesn't lack imagination, it is simply not believable. For me to explain why would be to reveal the ending. Like so many movies today, this one pushes the idea that ghosts and paranormal phenomena are real and that we should believe in them.<br/><br/>If this film is a tribute to Alfred Hitchcock (as one commenter suggests), then all I can say is the makers pay him poor tribute. Hitchcock always grounded his films in unflinching realism. That is why he was a master. He relied only on human motivation and psychology to underpin the behavior of his characters. Nevertheless, he succeeded in chilling us to the bone without invoking the supernatural, preternatural, or any other beyond-the-natural. And the ending is total rubbish.<br/><br/>I give it 3/10. And a 3 solely because John Cusack and Ray Liotta are in it."
"kenjha","4","1","5","7 January 2013"," Ludicrous Thriller
","A group of strangers is stranded at a remote motel on a stormy night, as a killer strikes. This thriller, patterned after ""And Then There Were None,"" gets off to an intriguing if silly start, as a convoluted premise is used to gather the victims at the motel. In fact, it has the makings of a delicious black comedy, but that's a road not taken. As the victims start falling, the film becomes increasingly ludicrous until it reaches a mind-blowing, idiotic resolution. Until things fall apart at the end, it is fairly entertaining, although the violence is off-putting. It's a shame that it doesn't add up to much because it has a pretty good cast."

","Normally a film with a twist like this is tough to review, because some of the events are now...different. No such trouble here. Even without the colassally moronic surprise in the middle of the film, this muddled mess of a suspenser would've still tanked. Take ten or so people from different walks of life (through flashbacks which are then inexplicably abandoned) and seclude them at a rainy motel with a wackjob and watch the fun ensue. Even minus the twisty center, the dysfunctional mystery portion doesn't even come off because of abounding implausibilities dealing with characters. Toughest to take of all is the lengthy, lull-filled build up to the main ""plot"", if you can call it that. Throws in an ending where you'll be muttering ""Noo, noo, don't end it on such a stupid note..."", and sure enough, it does. Earns one point for the obvious near-replica design of the Bates Motel from ""Psycho"", but nothing else performance or story wise. Useless."

","From director James Mangold (Cop Land; Girl, Interrupted, Walk the Line, Knight and Day), I remember seeing this film once before, but I probably didn't fully grip to grips with what was going on, and was unsure my opinion rating was accurate, so I watched it again. Basically psychiatrist Dr. Malick (Spider-Man 2's Alfred Molina) has discovered a journal belonging to his patient Malcolm Rivers (Pruitt Taylor Vince) who awaits execution for the murder of several victims in a motel, and through flashback we see the horrific events take place. The ten strangers who end up at the motel in the middle of the night during a stormy night are limo driver and former cop Ed Dakota (John Cusack), cop Officer Rhodes (Ray Liotta) who is transporting serial killer Robert Maine (Jake Busey), attractive prostitute Paris (2012's Amanda Peet), newlyweds Ginny (Clea DuVall) and Lou (William Lee Scott); family in crisis with father/husband George York (John C. McGinley), mother/wife Alice (Leila Kenzle) and son Timmy (Bret Loehr) and 80's movie star Caroline Suzanne (Rebecca De Mornay). All have ended up at the motel, and soon enough they realise they are all in danger as they are being killed one by one by an unknown psycho, and after he killed Maine they confirm it is not an obvious person. They do at one point suspect the motel's owner Larry (John Hawkes), because he has all the keys to the doors and all the knowledge of each room, but he is killed as well ruling him out too. We found out towards the end however that all the characters we have been watching are part of Rivers, he suffers from extreme dissociative identity disorder, meaning that he is playing out what happened in reality as all the people he killed. In the end, we do see a conclusion to the in his mind story, the authorities conclude that Rivers should be placed in a mental institution, and we find out that the personality that was doing all the murders was Timmy, and he (Rivers) did manage to kill all the victims, including the final victim who supposedly got away. The cast of well known stars all do reasonably well, the killing spree format does okay, and the conclusions of how it all happened are near enough alright twists, all in all though it isn't exactly something I need to see again, but it's not a terrible murder mystery thriller. Okay!"
"Jozxyqk","4","1","5","15 December 2004"," A 'whodunnit' film with an obvious twist (SPOILERS)
","I was informed by friends of mine and movie reviewers that although this movie was pretty average, the ending is impossible to guess. I can truthfully say right now that I practically saw the ending coming.<br/><br/>SPOILERS FROM HERE<br/><br/>Firstly, the thing about the 'cop' being a convict and the other con being his sidekick was extremely obvious. I first noticed how he was about to grab the key tag from the first victim without worrying about tampering with evidence. Then there was the fact that when the second convict turned up he attacked him to the point of unconsciousness so he couldn't talk. (The 'cop-being-the-killer thing may have been more obvious to me after seeing the stage production of 'The Mouse Trap').<br/><br/>However, the fact that the scenario was all part of a DID-sufferer's hallucination didn't spring on me until it was revealed that all of them shared the same birthday.<br/><br/>But finally, I found it quite obvious that the child was the murderer for a fact when he walked out the room with his mother, discovering she was dead.<br/><br/>I also guessed the clichéd ending how the criminal gets away with it after 'fooling' the cops/lawyers that in some way allow him to escape ('Primal Fear' and 'The Usual Suspects' to name two). I guess it wasn't an obvious fool, but I suspect the child purposely did this to reveal himself so he could escape.<br/><br/>So there you have it. I must say that this film doesn't deserves the score of 7.3 it currently has. A score between 6 and 7 would be more appropriate. I do believe that this was a creative twist on the 'whodunnit' where everyone's picked off one by one. However, I could've enjoyed it more had it not been so clichéd and silly at times."

","***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** Well, I saw this movie on a whim because X-Men 2 was sold out and all of my friends are HUGE Cusack fans.  So I was going into it with NO expectations whatsoever... well, I did watch Ebert and Roeper a while ago and they gave it ""one thumb up"" so that was it.<br/><br/>Right... well, the premise of the movie:  10 strangers, one hotel, twists and turns, stabby stabby.  A ton of this movie was SO predictable but yet I thought that aspects of the ending were not as predictable.  Sure, people call the Schitzo take on everything unoriginal and stuff but I thought that that aspect of the movie was not predictable at all... until everything comes together near the end.<br/><br/>SO MUCH POTENTIAL and it was all lost with ""little timmy"".  IDENTITY had the potential of an EXCELLENT psychological thriller with the schitzo thing but it was all lost inthe very very end with little timmy and his CHEEZY line ""Whores don't get a second chance"".  THey should have ended it on a happy note with Ray Liotta being the murdering personality like he was instead of stupid timmy.  As soon as Paris finds the key and looks up and sees timmy there I BURST out laughing... my friends did too... then he said his crappy end line and everyone booed the movie.  TERRIBLE!  All the potential for a good movie was lost in the cheezy end line.  My respect for the movie was lost... I was thinking ""hmmm, that was really good and serine... nice ending..."" <whores don't get a second chance. ""THAT SUCKED"".<br/><br/>Up until 5 minutes before the end, 8/10... because of the ending, 3/10<br/><br/>I'm wondering what the director was thinking leaving that ending in... it would make a good ""DVD Alternate Ending"" but not for the actual movie."
"Quinoa1984","5","1","5","26 April 2003"," Identity is Mangold trying to do something of a Stephen King work, which has it's hits and misses
","Identity has one of those spectacular starts to a suspense movie where a bunch of characters wind up in the same place due to a series of shattering, if overly-fantastic, set of circumstances.  A family driving in the car gets a spare tire from a shoe on the road dropped by a woman, the mother steps out of the car and gets knocked by another car which has an ex-cop as the driver and the passenger as an actress.  They go to a motel, where also a cop is transporting a prisoner.  But then things start to happen...<br/><br/>The suspense works when the performances do, which is a good lot (maybe half) of the time thanks to the usual style of Cusack, Liotta, and even supporting players such as McGinley and Busey.  Yet, the other half of the time, which makes up the third act, comes off as hokeyness.  There is intrigue in what unfolds in the psychological aspect, but there's too much of a feeling of the story becoming convoluted.  It's basically a try from the director of Copland and Girl, Interrupted, to try for a Stephen King type of story- the ending should remind viewers what I mean.  Possibly worthy for a future night viewing when nothing else is on.  C+"
"christophe92300","4","1","6","7 April 2013"," Mediocre thriller
","Identity never arouses a huge interest because its script is a lot too conventional and almost doesn't produce any suspense or kind of build-up. Everything unfolds in a disconcerting linearity, close to a real boredom until the twist supposedly ""making"" the movie. Unfortunately, this revelation doesn't produce the desired effect, and even quite the opposite because the movie then feels ridiculous. The worst aspect about this twist is that it happens about 20 minutes before the end of the movie, which implies the last part of the story is useless.<br/><br/>Only the atmosphere is quite good, and still, it is badly served by an also very conventional cinematography that relies on the classic ropes of the genre.<br/><br/>As for the cast, though good on paper, it is under exploited because of the shallow characters."

","'Identity (2003)' sort of gets worse the longer you think about it, in a way, thanks mainly to its silly ending that tries to get in one last, somewhat 'edgy' shock but ends up feeling cheap, pretty nonsensical and, frankly, downright goofy. It's not just the ending itself that causes this retrospective souring, for the movie's true nature - revealed towards its final third - almost delegitimises the overall experience. In and of itself, this twist is a perfectly fine - though, very early-2000s - way to wrap up the plot, tying together the piece's otherwise apparently disparate halves in a relatively natural and, even, fairly clever way. The issue comes when you realise that this reveal actually makes the mainline 'whodunnit' stuff ever-so-slightly superfluous, especially when paired with the true ending that throws everything into question from a writing point of view. When taken as a whole, with everything on the table, the picture doesn't feel as though it knows what it really is or, even, what it's trying to do, I suppose - aside from take the audience on a 'guessing game', horror-themed roller-coaster. In the end, that's perfectly fine. That's all it is, though: fine. It could have been a lot more, a thriller that keeps your brain whirring long after its credits have rolled. In the moment, the movie is entertaining enough and it keeps you suitably engaged. Its puzzle pieces all fit together nicely and it doesn't cheat, per se - until it reaches its final reveal, which relies on, essentially, hidden information and, thus, feels cheap. I will say that I figured out its most major twist far before the piece ostensibly wanted me to, but that's not so much an issue as a testament to the fact that the jigsaw is solvable and, therefore, satisfying (until the final reveal, that is). It's also a testament to the fact that it's all quite generic. Ultimately, it's meant to be experienced and then forgotten, lapped up by an audience that love a good twist whether or not it makes absolute narrative sense or adds to its overall cohesion. It's well-made, enjoyable and almost entirely forgettable. 6/10"

","Identity was one of those movies I had to re-watch before doing the review just to remember what happened, and I watched the movie a month ago. So, to say the least, this movie was pretty forgettable. <br/><br/>Since this a horror film I guess I should talk about the ""horror."" Its not all that interesting, its just a bunch of jump scares and not much else. They have some scenes that actually a lot funnier than they should be, just because of how lazily the horror is executed.<br/><br/>Another thing about this movie is that it has another horror film trope . dumb, cliché and hate-able characters. There wasn't a single character that I remember saying ""Oh that was a well written and developed character"" or ""Oh, that was an interesting character, I hope they don't die by the end."" Speaking of clichés, the movie follows the ancient early 2000′s film cliché of having a weird green color palette, because The Matrix did it and everyone liked it then so why not reuse it over and over again.<br/><br/>Finally, I want to talk about the twist ending of the film, so if you haven't seen the film you probably won't understand what I'm talking about after this. I feel the twist ending was really forced in, and I think at first it was interesting, but as I was thinking about I realized that this is the type of twist ending M. Night Shyamalan would do. Also, now that I think about it, the title of the movie subtly spoils the twist ending. If the twist wasn't in the movie what would you call it then? ""Everyone Dies At The Hotel""<br/><br/>Anyways, Identity was pretty forgettable in a lot of ways, but the twist was pretty memorable, if for the wrong reasons.<br/><br/>Final Score: 4.5/10"

","Identity (2003): Dir: James Mangold / Cast: John Cusack, Ray Liotta, Amanda Peet, Jake Busey, Clea DuVall: Thriller that jerks viewers around the theme of multiple personalities. What the screenplay needs is multiple good story points. It begins fine with characters introduced as well as events surrounding their arrivals. We have the family with the injured passenger. We have an ex-cop driving a snotty actress in a limousine. We have a cop as well as the killer he is transporting, as if that isn't obvious. We have the eloping couple that bicker like guest from The Jerry Springer Show. Finally we have a hooker named Paris (how nice). One graphic incident after another with images of characters being hacked to pieces, hit by cars, bludgeoned to death, shot to death, etc. We are even given the image of a baseball bat emerged from someone's mouth. That is about the height of intelligence in this dead beat film. Director James Mangold makes good use of locations but this is no Cop Land. Actors are like roll call from limo driver John Cusack to cop Ray Liotta, to Peet with a case of money, to psychotic Jake Busey who escapes, to Clea Du Vall as a whiny bride. This is a roll call in shame with actors capable of better things than this. They assemble in single file until their time to be picked off has arrived. What we have here is a blood drenched mess done by people who should remain nameless. Score: 4 / 10"

","I don't understand how could this film reach 7+ points.<br/><br/>The cast was good, and the roles fit to the actors/actresses, so it could've been a good film. <br/><br/>My main problem with the film is that it uses the basic, overused, boring horror/thriller schema: ""Put them in a closed area at night, with rain and thunder and start killing them mysteriously and show some bloody corpse."".(I like GOOD horrors/thrillers, but this is not one of them I think)<br/><br/>And the ""murderer""? I've figured out the whole plot after the first or second dead character. Who is the most mysterious character and didn't say a word? The ""little kid"". But this is not possible to kill people this way with a child's physique, so it's a schizophrenic ""hallucination"" stuff or something like that. And at the end ta da.

","...i've watched this film multiple times over the years and it never gets boring, there is always something new that i have not noticed before. first off, i would like to say that James Mangold is one of the best directors around who probably no one has heard of. you don't have to give him a big budget for him to make a good movie. he did "" 3:10 to Yuma "" on something like 20 million dollars and most of the money went to the 2 huge leads ( Christian bale and Russell crowe ), and that movie looked like a 60 million dollar picture...which still isn't a big budget.<br/><br/>this movie in my opinion has so many good things going for it and i would give it a little higher then an 8 except Amanda peete's acting was just a little bit weak compared to everybody else's. i personally am a big fan of her's though and she's gotten a lot better over the years, where i think she can carry a feature film by herself now.<br/><br/>the night scenes...the constant rain( less then 1 minute of the film had no rain or thunder and lighting ). i love that type of atmosphere and you can look high and dry and go blind before you find another movie with all rain and at night...trust me, i tried.<br/><br/>the photography was great, there was a lot of tension and suspense. there are plenty of twist and turns in this movie and one great one. great mystery slasher flick...you are not going to find many of this caliber, one of Mangold's best if not his best.<br/><br/>all in all you can't go wrong with this movie as a movie fan as it is so well done. i believe that if you do watch this movie and enjoyed it you will watch this movie many more times over the coming years. for some reason this movie just stays on my mind over the years. a great gem that i think not many people know about and to me a timeless classic "" who done it ?

","Warning - contains *Spoilers' - all over! <br/><br/>It wont be a review as such, just three basic criticisms of the movie. Without these flaws the movie would have fared well - in fact very well, beating major blockbusters and probably reaching a very high position among 2003 movies. <br/><br/>1) Some may disagree but - the ending is predicable. The major flaw resides in the scene where this little boy goes to his dying mom's room and then comes back. And THEN everyone immediately discover that his mom is dead. Whoever watched the movie knows to what scene I refer. Now, after that moment I immediately knew that the boy MUST BE a serial killer and whoever is intelligent enough must have picked it up straightaway too, and the situation was not bettered by portraying Cusack as murderer - the plot was out at that moment. If not for that scene, I would never have guessed till the end: they should have deleted that scene. <br/><br/>2)This may sound a bit silly but if all these 10 people were just his 'personalities' then they did not even 'exist' in real life to begin with, but only in this crazy person's head. Now - the 'interest' factor certainly goes down: coz its not like he was killing real people one by one: the body was one, the mind was split. My point: the movie is far from being equated to the fascinating Agatha Christie's masterpiece 10 little Indians - with a similar plot - and it IS a shame. <br/><br/>3) I am not saying that cast could have been much better. Its OK - comparing this movie to the 'Strangers' movie released some time later or even the 'Devil'movie - it is fine. My point rather is NO MATTER how strong, mentally insane, evil, deceiving a boy may be in that it is NOT realistically physically possible that he performed some of the killing in the movie, especially taking a baseball bat and shoving it in a person's throat - killing him. This is just a minor comment, but come on...strong adult people often find it very difficult to kill themselves."

","Dissociative identity disorder (commonly known as multiple personality disorder)is the basic theme of this flick .. so wonderfully woven around 10 characters. John Cusack, Ray Liota and Amanda Peet all have given excellent performances. It is a psychological thriller, mistaken as a horror movie by many. For the lovers of movies like Shutter Island and A Beautiful Mind ..... Identity is a must see. The movie is intended for watchers of mature mind as the theme is too heavy to digest if due attendance is not paid to the dialogues and story development. The initial scenes of an asylum get reconnected in the end with the drop scene but the point of crescendo was the tussle between Cusack and Liotta."

Its quite unfortunate that this movie is often never compared or mentioned with the others.<br/><br/>The movie starts as two side plot , one dealing with a psychiatrist, Dr.Malick(Alfred Molina) saving his patient from death sentence and the other one involves a group of people stuck in a rain storm at a motel , fighting off and fending themselves from...a killer! The two plots are connected , how exactly? Unfortunately that cannot be revealed here without spoiling the plot.<br/><br/>The story is completely engrossing and this is one such perfect edge of the seat thriller that will tighten the screws so hard and to such an extent to drive the viewer crazy and hungry for a solution.

","For at least three quarters of this movie you think you're watching the same story that's been done over and over again in various settings. A group of complete strangers have been forced together by a set of strange circumstances and coincidences and - wouldn't you know it - they start to get killed off one by one. Ho hum. OK. You know what you're in for. It's nothing special because it's been done so many times before, but there's a reasonably effective mystery as to who's actually doing the killing and so you settle in for what you expect will be a passable if utterly unspectacular movie, made a little bit better by a pretty good cast, headed by John Cusack, Ray Liotta and Amanda Peet. Then comes the twist - truly one of the more effective (because it's so unexpected) twists I've ever seen in a movie.<br/><br/>We knew from the beginning of the movie that a serial killer was a part of the equation. He's being transported to a hearing the night before he's due to be executed for his crimes, and a car accident makes him one of the strangers, and the obvious suspect - until he, too, turns up dead. But who could have expected the actual twist. None of it is real. Everything is taking place inside the mind of the serial killer, who actually has multiple personality disorder and is receiving some type of treatment designed to bring his various personalities ""together"" at the same time so that they can kill one another off - including the one responsible for committing the serial killings. Sure. It's probably nonsense, but still I was taken completely off balance by that one. It was completely unexpected and - as far as I'm concerned - quite ingenious. My only quibble with it is that perhaps the ""twist"" was introduced a bit too soon. Once it was revealed it seemed to take away some of the drama of what was happening, because now we knew that it was all inside the killer's head, and that none of the actually murders taking place are actually taking place. Still, the movie manages also to end on a bit of a ""twist"" note. Things are still not exactly what you expect - the identification of which personality is actually the serial killer is a surprise.<br/><br/>The movie left things a little bit open at the end, making me wonder if a sequel (never made) was on the minds of the producers. Whether that was or not, this turned out to be a decent little thriller; much more entertaining than I expected it to be at first."

"brandon_lee420","10","0","1","24 May 2010"," Probably the best Thriller/Suspense film ever made!
","Identity maybe the best thriller film of all time considering that it has all the elements and a unique substance that holds this film together and, simply, it just is a unique masterpiece by James Mangold. James Mangold is a visionary director who has made great films like 3:10 to Yuma, Walk The Line, Girl, Interrupted but even though they maybe great, Identity easily tops that list in a flash. James Mangold uses a lot of twists and sometimes confusing puzzles to make you like this film and out of nowhere the puzzle will be answered with a new brilliant twist. Even though I give films ten stars, it still does not mean that they are perfect but with a film like this, it is a whole different case. Identity and a lot of other ten star films surely do come to be perfect. A few centimeters more and they will become my next best friend. Gosh, how could I have thought that this would be time wasting? How could I think that this will be crap? How could I think something bad about this? Answer = Stupidity. This film defines the ""Don't Judge a Movie By Its Cover"" tagline. Now to the acting and performances by the crew in this film. John Cusack is in his game with this film as he plays a likable ex-cop turned limo driver, who ends up in a motel that is in the middle of nowhere along with more people who, mysteriously, all have a connection to each other. His acting is what defines acting in a good way and when I mean that, I am f*king dead serious. Ray Liotta is also another performer to watch out for because he portrays someone who knows more than he is letting on. I love his scary, yet deadly secret. Liotta acts beautifully and convincingly all the way till we find more about him. Amanda Peet plays a prostitute who is heading for a place to start a new life specializing in growing oranges, who also, strangely, goes to the motel. Amanda is strong in this film and near flawless. Before I go on, you might be wondering that why are they all ending up in a motel. Answer = it is raining and the streets are flooded. Alfred Molina is unrecognizable as he plays Dr.Mallick and I didn't even know that he was performing in this film if it wasn't for the credits. Nevertheless, he still does a great job. The plot is greatly crafted and engaging from the first scene. The storytelling which is seen from all sides is quite clever and adds a little bit more depth to the whole film. The cinematography is outstanding and spooky because, since it's raining, with no where to go, you have no choice but to go to a motel where you are wondering who is going to die first. The rainy setting is the perfect setting for this psychological thriller. The atmosphere also has a clear sense of horror stuck to it, a perfect atmosphere for a film. This review is all positives but no negative. Erm......The film is too scary!! That is my only concern - thank you! I am ranting on too much about this film but that is hard to since I wanna tell you all about it and why you should watch it. One: Great acting. Two: Brilliant cinematography. Three: Great twists. Four: likable characters. Must Watch!!! I highly recommend this to anyone, children and adults alike since I am not a classification freak like some, but the only concern I have is that it has a confusing story that takes a lot of time to figure out but if you want to have a go at it.... please do.<br/><br/>Strangers from all different walks of life: a limo driver escorting a movie star, parents with a young son, a cop transporting a convict, a prostitute, a young couple, and a motel manager are caught up in a nasty rainstorm, stuck at a motel in desolate Nevada. Soon they realize they may be at the motel for another reason when one by one, people start getting killed off. As tensions flare and fingers are pointed, they have to get to the bottom of why they're there. Meanwhile in an undisclosed location, a psychiatrist is trying to prove the innocence of a man accused of murder in an eleventh hour trial. How these two through-lines are related can only be found in Identity.<br/><br/>Minor spoilers hereon: When you find out that they all have the same birthday and are named after a state or country, you are think WTF! but the ending tells you why this is what it is. The waiting to find out what happens is really annoying because with a film like this, storytelling has to be fast and clear at the same time. The story about the ""Indian Cemetery"" is a really scary mini-story that gives you something to think about. It is haunting as well. The ending was great and unexpected so you don't really know what is happening until PANG you are hit in the face with an unbelievable twist. The boy who, reportedly, dies is quite scary to think about. The funny thing is that, if you have watched the film, John Cusack is actually a fat, bald guy. For a reason I found that funny. My words are running out.....Damn!! The original score is great and adds a bit more creepiness to the film which will make you enjoy it way more. The uniqueness of this film is very rare and hard to find nowadays in film. The ""I met a man who wasn't there..."" poem is frightening and greatly written. The voice that says that adds a bit more effect to the hauntingness of it. Should definitely be on you ""Must Watch list!"" 10/10 - A Masterpiece! Bravo!<br/><br/>""Over and out."" 24 March 2010."

","Identity is a thriller set at an isolated motel in rural Nevada during an unrelenting rainstorm. With all roads washed out and all forms of communication dead, a group of people become stranded at the motel along with the shifty manager (John Hawkes). Among the stranded are Ed (John Cusack), a former cop turned limo driver; Caroline (Rebecca De Mornay), a self-absorbed actress; Paris (Amanda Peet), a prostitute attempting to escape her profession; Rhodes (Ray Liotta), a cop transporting a prisoner (Jake Busey); Lou (William Lee Scott) and Ginny (Clea DuVall), bickering newlyweds; and George (John McGinley) and Alice (Leila Kenzle), a married couple traveling with their young son. Soon the waterlogged lodgers start dying in mysterious--and brutal--ways, and the increasingly dwindling number of survivors must discover the killer to prevent their own demises.<br/><br/>The initial formula for this film seems very cliché and something we've seen a thousand times before. However, Identity has a very clever and bold twist. Something very unexpected that completely turns the film around and makes it one of the most original thrillers I have seen in a long time. It's hard to talk about it without spoiling the film but I'll say this, the viewers that ""stick"" trough Identity will be rewarded with something much more interesting and intriguing then the usual ""we're getting murdered one by one""-kind of thriller. Also the entire cast did a good job with perhaps Amanda Peet standing out. Overall, a very original little thriller and a breath of fresh air from an overdone genre.<br/><br/>6.5/10"

","Now i must warn you that the first half of this film is an chore to get through. In fact i was thinking of turning the damn thing off but if you keep on watching , the film begins to pick up the pace and the plot becomes more diverse . This not the best thriller every but it contains its own original twist. The setting is perfect. An motel placed in the middle of nowhere. The director captures the atmosphere well with the constant raining and lightning adding more of an effect. Sure these two elements are always being used but there nothing wrong with that.<br/><br/>The actors carry out there roles reasonable well. there no exceptional performance from anyone but you don't expect that from this type of film. Now for the twist, a lot of people struggle to understand it. Personally , it not all to complicated to follow. If you know about split personalities then the conclusion shouldn't be to hard to understand.<br/><br/>Some negatives is that the ending is easily predictable. It doesn't keep you guessing but instead wondering if the whole plot ties together. Also there no artistic value to it. When you are told of what is really happening you will begin to wonder if the director could of added more depth to the world rather than basing it in another typical world .<br/><br/>But still the film is enjoyable to watch and one which you'll be talking about after it finishes. The first half is rather boring but the second half comes to life . If you love thrillers then this is an film for you"

Kudos must go to James Mangold for directing the all-star cast so tautly and keeping the movie so atmospheric. Its amazing how persistent rain adds to the hopelessness and depravity of the scene and as noted by ray liotta in the special features, john cusack was very lucky to have been somehow cast wearing a raincoat! I wouldn't dare leave a spoiler here as the what really makes the movie is the fantastic twist, trust me, you won't have any idea and you wouldn't guess it if you had a thousand attempts. What I loved about this movie was that there was such great chemistry between the actors, the tension was really palpable which is missing in so many modern movies.

Both these story will create a twist at the end that would leave you speechless. Well, maybe not.<br/><br/>This is an ingenious horror thriller with many plot twists and surprises. The beginning is quite clever where the camera stops at one point and goes to the past to show you what happens. The way the people are in the motel feels claustrophobic. No cellphones work and no cars will go over the flooded roads. This isn't a brilliant thriller but it's good enough to be a great movie.<br/><br/>John Cusack's and Amanda Peet's acting are great. This is an intelligent thriller so you might need the brains to understand the twist. Well, maybe not. It's quite easy to follow, really. Although the twist might not be satisfying for some, it is really satisfying for me.<br/><br/>This is a great thriller. I've seen many and this one is unique. It keeps you guessing until the end and you'll be shocked. Go watch it!"
"spirona","9","0","1","13 March 2006"," great plot, executed well, with a twist
","There are very few intelligent, scary/suspenseful movies made in Hollywood. Identity, however, is one of them. Is it perfect? No: Identity follows the formula of recent thrillers (Sixth Sense, Hide and Seek, etc.) where there is a slow build-up, sprinkled with suspenseful moments, to a revelatory climax. Some of the writing is hokey and clumsy at times and the characters can be cartoon-like and one-dimensional (Liotta and Hawkes). But I either overlooked that or simply embraced it and enjoyed it. So it's not an indie film or a foreign film (you decide if that's good or bad). But it is a somewhat different, and surprisingly well-made Hollywood film. Identity was entertaining, thought-provoking, scary, suspenseful, and funny. What else do you want?"
"Lt_Coffey_182","8","0","1","26 December 2005"," An example of how films should be
","Identity is a very unique film that impressed me very much when I first saw it and every time I've seen it since. The story is fascinating as it is so full of suspense and it really gets your adrenal glands in overdrive. After this immense build up, the film shatters the audience's sense of reality with an incredibly clever and unpredictable twist that must surely be on a par with Memento. This is an excellent example of what is meant by on screen magic and in retrospect; it's very surprising that this film is not even more famous.<br/><br/>What helps to unfold the plot so magnificently is the characters. Almost every character involved has a crucial part to play and it seems that every actor was casted perfectly for their roles, most notably John Cusack and Ray Liotta. Cusack's character is probably the most demanding as he is the only character who discovers the twist except for the audience and Cusack's total shock is very convincing as it was a almost a mirror image to my reaction. One of the more enjoyable roles was Jake Busey's role as the convicted killer. Busey has definitely been typecast with more psychotic roles but in Identity, he shows us that's not such a bad thing. Amanda Peet is definitely worth a mention and is most responsible for garnering the audience's emotions. One of the best and most effective ensembles there's been in years.<br/><br/>The direction is outstanding. The audience is manipulated to wherever James Mangold wishes and I can speak from experience; it's one hell of a journey. Mangold shows Identity as a Jigsaw puzzle where every character has their journey to the hotel explained throughout the film via flashbacks and the mainly off screen violence ensures that everything is kept a mystery until the last minute. The constant recital of a poem throughout the film provides added mystery and atmosphere, making Identity very intense. The fact that almost the whole film is set in this one hotel gives a very claustrophobic feel which is always effective in a Thriller. Mangold definitely read the 'How to Make a Good Thriller' Manual when making this film! With all the ingredients of a good film firmly in place and a very clever plot, Identity proves a very memorable film that is definitely at the height of the genre and will hopefully have a longer shelf life than all the recent blockbusters."

","This movie was a very good psychological thriller.Depiction of Multiple personality disorder is very good.

This is a very common plot in movies though. Isolate the characters and take them out. Seems very typical of Hollywood movies. The ending does not at all seem like most movies we see out there.It was a little confusing as to who the killer really was in the movie. Whether the incident in Nevada was real or not.

At first this seems like a typical horror movie- people are killed off one by one and no one knows who the killer is, but as it develops there are some interesting twists and turns. The fact that there is a storm the whole way through the movie adds to the creepy feeling, and leaves you slightly uneasy as certain guests stray from their rooms.

Was one of them his mother..because they kept showing a photo of a dead woman who could have been possibly his mother? I know they didn't go into detail about the people that were REALLY killed..but I was thinking that since the Larry character AND the child both had this hatred for prostitutes, and Malcolm's mother was a prostitute..that maybe somehow there was a connection? Also...why, after Edward finds the key next to the woman's bed, and they found the #7 key on her husband's body..why were they all of a sudden in a big hurry to flee the area? I didn't understand that part..did they all think they knew who the murderer was or something..because before that, the Ray Liotta character said they should all stay in the room.

","What would you think of when a group of people with unusual backgrounds, copious personal problems, and varying motives are forced to stay together in an abandoned motel situated in the middle of nowhere? In ""Identity"", the answer is murder by numbers and the setting befits this most excellently - an extraordinarily mysterious and sinister concoction of horror, thrill, mysticism, and frustration.<br/><br/>The film begins with several characters finding their fates intertwined with each other when all of them were trapped in a heavy storm and had to seek protection in a motel. Ironically, they became trapped in a predicament instead. They realised this when one of them was found brutally murdered and mutilated. The characters then decided that before the killing progressed further, they needed to find and arrest the murderer. As they stumbled along their investigation, more of them got killed.<br/><br/>Such a situation makes the audience think really hard about who may be the culprit. Normally, the audience starts naming their guesses as more incidents occur. This is exactly what happens with this film too, but as the plot continues to roll on, the audience will grow even more bewildered and surprised because things slowly become unexplainable. Then the twists come, making the intricate plot even more compelling.<br/><br/>If you stay focused when watching this film, you will find an extremely brilliant plot. It is not merely about murder in a motel, but the plot goes far beyond that to explore the complexities of human mind and their relation to identity. Remember, the film is not entitled ""Identity"" for nothing."
"silk63826","9","0","1","1 April 2005"," Identity is a film that will divide audiences -- the twists of its plot will either impress or exasperate you.
","IDENTITY, directed by James Mangold, is a thriller set at an isolated motel in rural Nevada during an unrelenting rainstorm. With all roads washed out and all forms of communication dead, a group of people become stranded at the motel along with the shifty manager (John Hawkes). Among the stranded are Ed (John Cusack), a former cop turned limo driver; Caroline (Rebecca De Mornay), a self-absorbed actress; Paris (Amanda Peet), a prostitute attempting to escape her profession; Rhodes (Ray Liotta), a cop transporting a prisoner (Jake Busey); Lou (William Lee Scott) and Ginny (Clea DuVall), bickering newlyweds; and George (John McGinley) and Alice (Leila Kenzle), a married couple traveling with their young son. Soon the waterlogged lodgers start dying in mysterious--and brutal--ways, and the increasingly dwindling number of survivors must discover the killer to prevent their own demises.<br/><br/>Riveting from the opening sequence, Mangold's suspenseful murder mystery wastes no time in turning on the tension. Realizing that truly scary cinema comes from the unknown and the unexpected, Mangold and screenwriter Michael Cooney keep the audience--and the film's characters--in the dark and continually create situations that go from bad to worse for the luckless travelers. Cusack anchors the film as the resigned but noble former policeman, while Peet reveals a depth previously unseen in her other movies. Actors such as Liotta, McGinley, Hawkes, and De Mornay round out the fine ensemble cast. As with many thrillers, IDENTITY has a big twist, but because of the filmmakers' excellent slight of hand, it's unlikely viewers will predict the bizarre outcome."

","When I was watching Identity, for first 40 minutes of a movie I was thrilled. I thought, now THIS is a GOOD MOVIE. Great actors, especially Cusak and Liotta, great horror-thriller atmosphere: heavy rain, night, scary motel in middle of nowhere, homicides... well, I was very enjoying this. Idea of movie is obviously taken from Agatha Christy's novel 'Ten little Indians' and that was fine with me. Ten mysteriously connected strangers caught up in a lonely motel in the middle of nowhere with scary motel owner. And then one by one, ten strangers are being murdered. Brrrr! Who is the killer? How are those people connected? Then, circa 40 minutes into the movie, there's strange plot twist happening. And spoils everything. Since that moment, I don't care about people in motel, because I know they do not really exist. I know who is a killer (at this moment it's pretty much obvious). I don't care about rest of the movie. It's just not interesting anymore. I even feel cheated. The end is just stupid. We discover who the killer is and we knew that already since we saw the plot 40 min into the movie. I could predict exactly what will happen and it spoiled second half of the movie. Then comes end. Stupid. Why did they let dangerous killer drive without any real security? Who in the right mind would fall for that old trick ""Aghhhhh, I feel bad, open the cage!!!!"" 7 stars because first half is great."

","This films takes one of the more common of film plots, that of strangers stranded together while they are murdered one by one, and delivers a entirely new twist to the proceedings. Everyone has some little secret that is slowly brought out to the viewer, and everyone also has a reason to kill one or more of the others. Each time a secret was revealed I'd think ""Well, that's it - he's the killer!"" (or ""She's the killer!"") until I'd labeled just about everyone that way. I even considered the ""least likely suspect"" as the killer just so I wouldn't be hoodwinked by the plot, and wouldn't you know it - each ""Least likely suspect"" starts dying off as well. It rains throughout this movie so much that the rain itself becomes a character to consider as the suspect. Then there's all that talk about the motel they are staying at as being built on top of an Indian burial ground. There's so many twists and turns that by the time the movie is over you almost feel like you've been on a carnival ride for two hours. Well done!"

We had it figured out pretty much 1/3 of the way through, but it still made for an entertaining evening in front of the fire. I think maybe the filmmakers gave us to much info. Our only problem was the timeline; we felt it was out of sync between the Rivers storyline and the motel. I don't want to give anything away, so I'll leave it at that. We also felt that the ending was to simplistic, and extremely Hollywood typical. I likened it to the end of Carrie in a way. The cast was first rate; I didn't even recognize DeMornay at first.

But other then that no beef at all with any of them i liked them all. the acting is AWESOME!!!! John Cusack is amazing here giving a wonderful performance and people say that his performance is weak watch this film again i thought he did a great job he was on the ball credible and very likable!. Ray Liotta is terrific here and was great i LOVED him even though his character was loud obnoxious and unlikable. but he always plays that role so it didn't bother me.Amanda Peet does WONDERFUL here as a you know what and was HOT!!!! to boot! she was likable and her character was full of emotion and i felt for her. Clea Duvall on the other hand i did not like she was to whiny and her constant crying irritated me.

Okay, so here's what goes on at the beginning: a kid, his mother, and stepfather (his real father left 2 years before), get a flat tire by a shoe (more on this later), so the stepfather is going crazy, trying to calm himself, reminding him what to do. so they slow to the side of the road and the kids mom is hit by another car, this one containing an ex-cop driver for an actress (her cell phone battery is dead). They stop to help them....weird kid btw...and then they drive over to a motel and try to get help there for an ambulance, phones are out... so the ex-cop leaves those three people there, and tries going to the hospital and getting help, as he's on his way he meets a woman with car trouble, it was her shoe that popped the other people's tire. He comes across a part where the roads are flooded. Another car shows up, a couple, he warns them the road is flooded and he asks them if they have a cell phone, they don't he tells them to turn around, they give him and the woman a ride back to the motel. After a while, a cop comes to the motel with a criminal so they have to stay. His radio doesn't work, so they're stranded until morning. One by one they are being murdered it seems like it's in number order, 10, 9 (was a six upside down), 8, 7, goes a bit out of order after that. They find out they all have the same birthday, may 10th.

The synopsis of the movie is one night when a thunderous storm occurs, 10 strangers meet each other in a small motel. A limo driver (Cusack), a cop (Liotta), a prostitute (Peet), a newlywed couple, a husband, wife and their son, an actress and prisoner who is with the policeman. And at the same time of the movie another convict who was found guilty on murder charges is in a meeting with district attorneys and a psychiatrist to talk about the execution tomorrow.<br/><br/>But what starts to get the viewers all pumped up and chilled is that one by one a person in the motel gets killed. The whole point is for the remaining people to try to find out the killer. John Cusack who is the main character of the movie plays his character perfectly and smartly gives his best performance to date, the same with Amanda Peet. Ray Liotta was an average performer in the movie and could've of done better. He wasn't as nasty as his character was to be assigned. <br/><br/>What I simply adored about the film was that it had me moving and my eyes wide open to all the twists, dialogue, actions, etc. that were going on during the movie. It had all different types of personalities you had to think about to try to guess about the murderer. I'll tell you, I guessed on 3 different characters and I was wrong. What the movie should've done to make it much better was by expanding on the idea. Make it a little longer so the person watching the film could keep thinking.

The fact that John Cusack and Ray Liotta stared in this movie made it good enough for me to watch. And let me tell you, watching this movie all alone in the middle of the night made it even creepier. Suddenly the house started making noises and it all added to the experience of this movie. The movie itself is great! Dark, creepy and at times a little weird. I for one had no idea what was going on and the end was awesome. I do not want to give away anything so i will be careful with what i say. But i will say this. Watch this movie. You will not regret it. And if you don't like it there is something wrong with you :) I rate this movie 8/10"

","I rented this last night and had no idea what was I getting. I knew most of the stars: John Cusak, Rebbeca Demornay (who I hadn't seen in movies for a while) and even Alfred Molina (who had a brief role in the 1st Indiana Jones movie). I actually thought I was going to dislike this movie because I had never heard anything about it. I guess that was my blessing, because IDENTITY was actually all the contrary: a fast moving, action packed and entertaining movie. You have to pay close attention to the beginning of IDENTITY, since an important premise is given and is later brought up to round up the film. On the surface, IDENTITY is about 10 people who meet in a run down motel in the middle of Nevada, on a heavy stormy night. They stay at the motel because of the heavy rain and because the roads are blocked. Among the people is an ex-cop turned limo driver (John Cusak), a has-been movie star (Rebecca Demornay), a recently retired prostitute (Amanda Peet), a Cop (Ray Liotta) driving a murderous convict (Jake Busey) to another Estate, a husband with a wounded wife and his,a young couple and the motel owner. These characters then start being murdered one by one with NO apparent reason or motive. This is where the real suspense begins. It's got enough gory murders to appeal to any bloodthirsty, fango crazy movie lover, but everything is done with the style of a big budget production.. All I can say is that what you are watching is not what it appears to be. I enjoyed IDENTITY a lot, especially John Cusak's performance (you see him in mostly comedy films) and proves that he can do the serious act very well. Good for a late night watching! 9* out of 10*!"

","I watched this movie without having an idea what it was about. It surprised me and I enjoyed it very much. It's recommendable to watch this movie without reading or hearing too much about it at first. I think that way you'll appreciate the movie more.<br/><br/>It begins as a kind of drama then it slowly turns into an horror movie, a thriller and a supernatural thriller. The way the story is build up is unique and works surprising well. Unlike many other movies from its genre, the story is complicated and plays a significant role. Horror with brains.<br/><br/>The movie never seize to surprise. The movie is full with plot twists, from beginning till the end. Highly recommendable for people who like to be surprised by a movie, even though real smart people already see the ending coming from miles away.<br/><br/>There is a nice Hitchcock like atmosphere and some great characters played by highly talented actors. Another significant difference with other movies from its genre.<br/><br/>Let this movie surprise you.<br/><br/>9/10<br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"

","""Identity"" is a surprise powerhouse.<br/><br/>John Cusack and Amanda Peet drew me to the movie. I was not prepared for the experience. James Mangold has created another film that is, at the least, consistent with his previous ""Girl, Interrupted"" (1999) and ""Heavy"" (1995).<br/><br/>Ten guests arrive at a ""Bates"" type motel and start dying. It sounds like the Agatha Christie classic ""And Then There Were None"" (1945 & 1975) a/k/a ""Ten Little Indians"" (1959, 1965 & 1989). . . but then it suggests that very theme. This is not the umpteenth remake, but rather a nice twist on the theme.<br/><br/>Who is the killer? Why are they being killed? What is going on? Sounds like Memento meets Christie. To my thinking -- it works on several levels. This is a film that you have to be ready to participate in . . . otherwise, save it until you have the energy.<br/><br/>John Cusack and Ray Liotta give very fine performances as would be expected. I think this is the best I have ever seen Amanda Peet. I hope director Mangold adds her to his acting company. Mangold has drawn another stellar performance from Pruitt Taylor Vince, who did such an excellent job in the Mangold's earlier referenced ""Heavy"" (1995).<br/><br/>It doesn't look like a $30 million movie, but it delivers much more. I suspect the budget was for the acting company that includes Cusack, Liotta, Vince and Clea DuVall. The acting troupe works!<br/><br/>Good direction. Very good acting. An excellent story. It is time to add James Mangold to my list of favored directors.<br/><br/>  - Michael"
"gus120970","Null","0","2","27 April 2004"," Hitchcock going off half-cocked
","I watched 'Identity' literally back-to-back, and coincidentally, with 'Psycho', the seminal slasher movie that brought serial killing into movie-goer's consciousness.<br/><br/>Homage is perhaps the kindest thing to say about Identity. In its desire to produce a Hitchcockian thriller worthy of the Matrix generation, it throws in the iconography of the director, from the very root of its singular Motel location to the multiple personalities of its pro-antagonist.<br/><br/>I say post-Matrix, as once the clichÃ© was to talk about the MTV generation, which derived from hi-octane visuals for low-attention span viewers, superficial meaning, artifice.<br/><br/>'Identity' is all these things, whilst retaining the additional right to use any outrageous plot twist to justify the accepted rules of physics and Artistotelian storytelling. In this case, revealing to the user about halfway through the film that the filmworld exists entirely in the mind of a deathrow serial killer who has assembled his 10 identities in one place to resolve his inner conflict.<br/><br/>The revelation of the plot twist is seductive - just at the point where the viewer is becoming cheesed off with how stupid the plot twists are, the audacious and neatly contrived plot theme is unveiled. However it is totally contrived - multiple personality in itself does not permit someone to live in an entirely fictive state. Plus in any imagined universe, the freedom of the author to mess around with physics and logicality without restraint becomes a big bore. Whilst Identity doesn't go on long enough to do that, it's ultimately an escapist fantasy slasher - not really a film about the mind of a serial killer. 'Psycho' is much more nutritious and thought-provoking, and scary, in its banality and realism.<br/><br/>Despite the care that has been taken to get the setting and atmospheric, and effects right, Psycho is a much more powerful film visually, even in black and white. The lingering shower shot, Janet Leigh's glassy eye are much more powerful and memorable images than Identity's rain-soaked exteriors and hack-and-slash shock stills."

","This may have some poor lines, weak acting (at times) and some shallow characters (at times), however, on the whole, flaws aside its really great. One could also consider the flaws part of the plot in hindsight.<br/><br/>
The `Hitchcockian' (is that a word?) motel is a great set to build this Agatha Christie ""10 Little Indians"" style whodunit. The damp, the rain, the low light start to become claustrophobic and sets the scene for later events. The build up starts off like a merry-go-round, picking up speed as the characters, all stereotyped warped personalities, interact. Interaction on many levels; sexual attraction, sexual repression, bigotry and fear. Onion like layers are revealed as we peer deeper into this alternative reality peeling back the stains of the past. At times we are pulled back into a mundane self determinant court case with a hostile judge and we know who will get nailed. Or we think we do.<br/><br/>Sometimes its a little ham or poor lines that pull us back but we are drawn back, into this spiral world, spinning out of control.<br/><br/>This is great movie to see on DVD - it's really a cult whodunnit-dunnit-dunnit ""damm !! I knew it was him/her"" type movie with some nice twists. The only thing that had me groaning was he end - but we can all do better ends can't we ?.<br/><br/>The beginning is great and the cast hold the suspense even when their own reality is suspended. The clues pop up with the right kind of intensity. The parallel court scene where Lawyers and Judges ""act"" out their roles is an interesting aside to our reality as voyeurs ...<br/><br/>Not 10/10 because of the ending but a well earned 7/10. Good plot, nice twists and turns on an old theme, good acting and a great set. Nice to see a movie adult psycho-thriller that relies on acting and set - rather than gratuitous special effects."

","Whatever you do, don't go into ""Identity"" expecting a stylish, well- written, original, horror- mystery film. What you'll get is juvenile dialogue: yes, everyone screams and swears back and forth at each other, some downright silly sequences-e.g. John Cusack and Amanda Peet standing over a just-discovered mutilated body enjoying a ho-hum conversation. You'll actually even see the old frightened girl turning around quickly into the arms of the good guy who apparently was just standing there. But despite mounds of this God aweful writing, we actually see some pretty interesting twists and turns along the latter part of the film - and quite an original ending, which leads us to believe-- ""Identity"" may have never quite taken itself seriously to begin with. This is the only reason that would explain talent the likes of Cusack and Ray Liotta would lend themselves to this near ""train- wreck?"". If you want a film that will expand the mind, do something else. If your looking for briskly paced, but sloppy written film that you can watch with the sound off, you may find this a guilty pleasure. 5/10. NIQUE."

","Riveting performances from some of Hollywood's finest combine in a rain soaked story of horror, intrigue, and blood in the middle of the Nevada desert. To start with the cliche, ""It was a dark and stormy night,"" is as accurate as one can get. There are some creepy twists and turns that will keep you on the edge of your seat. Plodding but methodical, the story unfolds without a break, or a chance for you to catch you breath. Just when you think you have the answer, a new element is introduced and you're back to square one. Some would say the ending deflates the film, but I disagree. Rule Number One: The least likely person is the killer. And to finish this experience, you get to keep a eerie little children's rhyme to take with you that will give you a chill on even the warmest day:<br/><br/>""When I was going up the stair, I met a man who wasn't there.

They begin dying, but we know there is something odd going on that we can't put our finger on. Of course, we can't guess it. Who could? But, we are intrigued as a few of the early scenes go backward in time - making us realize we there is something to this time line issue.

"DeeNine-2","4","0","2","18 January 2004"," If this were a book it would be psychobabble
","This is really a mess. One wonders how such movies get made. James Mangold, who was off to such fine start in his directorial career with the critically acclaimed Heavy (1995) and the superior psychodrama Girl, Interrupted (1999), and even the slightly offbeat but intriguing Cop Land (1997), really loses it here with this bizarro attempt at something like Psycho and David and Lisa meet Agatha Christie's ""Ten Little Indians.""<br/><br/>The premise is ridiculous and the resolution just plain silly. Without revealing anything (the denouement of the obtuse plot being perhaps the only thing that might keep the thumb of most intelligent viewers over the age of, say, fourteen, off the stop button) let me say that when it's over you just might feel cheated. <br/><br/>John Cusack stars as an ex-cop, now a chauffeur, who can suture wounds. The scene is the Nevada/California desert during a savage downpour that traps ten (+1) people at an isolated motel where bloody mayhem of the most inexplicable sort ensues as one by one the guests turn up dead. The action consists of wet people screaming and staring with horror at such sights as a dead man with a baseball bat shoved three-quarters of the way down his throat, etc. They insult each other a lot. Prostitutes don't like cops; little guys who never got any, hate prostitutes, and the little boy doesn't really love his mommy, etc. As the coincidences pile up (as the motel proprietor remarked, with the odds against being ""trillions to one"") we begin to realize that either something supernatural is going on or... You guessed it. It's all a....<br/><br/>But I can't say. We do get a hint of how everything will turn out when Mangold flash-forwards to a group of shrinks and other interested parties who are holding a kind of seance around what seems to be John Cusack's character.<br/><br/>Anyway, even the acting is not that good with the usually very fine Cusack seemingly infected by the deficiencies of the other players, or the stupidities of the script, or the impatient-to-get-it-over-with direction by Mangold. (I don't think the actors wanted too many takes in all that water, and it shows.) At any rate if you want to see a little kid and some mediocre actors overact or a lot of people deadpan the horror their eyes spy while barking at each other or you just like seeing Hollywood players have to make a living while wet, go for it. Otherwise, hit the off button and watch reruns of ""That 70's Show.""<br/><br/>(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!""

","When you watch ""Identity"", you immediately think of Agatha Christie's ""Ten Little Indians"". While its similar in theme, Director James Mangold adds some interesting psychological twists.<br/><br/> The story is essentially about ten strangers who are thrown together at a seedy motel on a rainy night somewhere in Nevada. First we meet the motel manager Larry (John Hawkes) who is contemplating a slow night as he gulps down another glass of whiskey. At various stages arrive, the York family, George (John C. McGinley), his wife Alice (Leila Kenzle) who has been involved in an accident, and their young son Timmy (Bret Loehr). They are followed by a limo driver Ed (John Cusack), his passenger an over the hill actress (Rebecca De Mornay) and a hooker Paris (Amanda Peet) whom they picked up on the road. Also taking refuge from the storm is a newly married couple Ginny (Clea DuVall) and Lou (William Lee Scott). Finally a police officer Rhodes (Ray Liotta) and his prisoner (Jake Busey) arrive.<br/><br/> Suddenly, gruesome murders begin happening as the ten begin to turn up dead one by one, by one means or another. The comment element is that room keys in descending order from 10 to 1 are found on each of the victims. The murderer remains a mystery although you may have your own suspect(s).<br/><br/> Running parallel to this story is one about a last minute hearing for a convicted mass murderer Malcolm Rivers (Pruitt Taylor Vince) in a chilling performance, who is to be executed the next day. His psychiatrist Dr. Malick (Alfred Molina) is trying to convince a judge (Holmes Osborne) that his patient was not responsible for the crimes that he was accused of due to newly discovered evidence. What this has to do with the main story becomes clearer as the movie progresses.<br/><br/> The acting in this movie is top notch from top to bottom and the direction is excellent. I'll give you a little advice though. Pay attention to the opening credit sequence. It will help explain things once you have seen the ending.<br/><br/> The DVD release has an alternate ending with an additional scene but it adds little to an already exciting thriller."

","On the surface, Identity seems like a cheap knockoff of an Agatha Christie paperback. You know the type. Several disparate types are stranded on an island or in an old mansion or a broken-down hotel, and it's raining cats and dogs outside, and wouldn't you know it, but they're being picked off, one by one. But beyond the obvious setup, this isn't anything like And Then There Were Young or its myriad imitations. This has a few twists, including an outstanding one right near the end. <br/><br/>Several people wind up at a ramshackle motel in the middle of nowhere. It's pouring rain. The road's been flooded both ways, so no one can get out. Among the stranded are a limo driver (John Cusack) and his employer-actress (Rebecca DeMornay), an irascible cop (Ray Liotta) and the convict he's chaperoning (Jake Busey), a prostitute (Amanda Peet), a newlywed couple, and a man (John C. McGinley) and his family, complete with a mute son.<br/><br/>Pretty disparate, all right. But trouble's afoot from the get-go, as Cusack, blinded by the torrential rain, runs over McGinley's wife, causing severe injuries. As the woman slips in and out of consciousness, Cusack must rush to the hospital to get an ambulance (phone's out, of course, and she can't be moved). But then it's flooded, see, and... well, everyone winds up back at the motel. <br/><br/>Sometimes thrillers explain themselves a bit too well - and too often - and the viewer has too much of an idea what's coming. Telegraphing what's to happen to a character is one of the biggest flaws of most thrillers, and if the viewer stops and thinks about the movie, the movie's sunk. Once thought enters the viewers mind, the holes in the plot are as familiar as Swiss cheese.<br/><br/>But the plot in Identity holds up very well, thanks in no small part to a great cast. Normally, in ensemble pieces like this the cast is comprised of once-great or once-pretty-good actors, people you've heard of but not lately. But Identity's cast is peppered with names familiar for their recent talents, and not their tabloid prowess. For instance, what's Cusack doing here? Isn't he slumming? Yes..... and no. It's a murder thriller, but he elevates the movie far beyond its rudimentary whodunit origins.<br/><br/>Cusack's great - I've yet to see him be awful - but he's not the only one with a bravura performance. Liotta's turn as the cop is gritty (he's no stranger to the role, playing a similar one in Unlawful Entry) and ultimately believable, and McGinley's a lot better than the underwritten role he was handed. Also shining is Peet as the hooker - I've never really liked her, but she did a good job with a good role.<br/><br/>And the atmosphere is wonderful! It felt like it was raining in my apartment. I jumped when they jumped, and I cringed when they cringed. That's good camerawork.<br/><br/>The good aspects are the ending, the ending, the acting, the ending, and the atmosphere; the bad aspect is the middle stuff, as a lot of the movie is slasherific. <br/><br/>But the ending is excellent, in case I forgot to mention it. The only thing I will tell you is that the standard ""everyone dies"" mantra begun by some guy named Shakespeare or something doesn't hold true here.<br/><br/>

It's a conventional ""scary"" whodunit and an unconventional ""you'll never guess the surprise ending"" movie. For me, it failed on both counts.<br/><br/>The whodunit is full of huge holes which can only be ""corrected"" once the ending is revealed  - so they distract you throughout the film. The first thing I was hard-pressed to accept was John Cusack's limo being stuck in a ditch when it's a rear-wheel drive car and the rear wheels are on level ground and it's the FRONT wheels (barely) in the water. But that's a minor quibble. What bugged me more about this film is that the end feels like a huge cheat, like they couldn't figure out what to do with this routine ""one-by-one"" plot and so they came up with this silly ""multiple personality""  gimmick. THAT'S what it felt like, really. It felt like a gimmick because it WAS a gimmick. And I LAUGHED OUT LOUD when it turned out to be little Timmy! It was like a JOKE!<br/><br/>And speaking of plot holes, the HUGEST is the ending. What cop transports a mass murderer with their hands cuffed IN FRONT OF THEM and not behind?! That is SUCH a movie/Hollywood jive-ass scenario. I knew what was going to happen the moment Alfred Molina's character slid open the oh-so-conveniently present sliding divider.

""Oh, by the way. The cop isnt really a cop, he's the convict. None of these people are real, they're just all from a split personality of yours.. and the one person in the movie you should never expect (oooh.. awww..) but for some reason you do, a child, is the real killer.. the real killer wins..

I do feel the need to say to all the people who rave about this movie and how original it is and then call anyone who disagrees with them an idiot - just because someone doesn't share your opinions, it really doesn't mean they're beneath you in intelligence. If you were a mature adult, you would realize that, and when you start name-calling, you sound really insecure. Truth is, there really isn't one scene or idea in this movie that hasn't been done before, and better in some cases. Also, it in NO WAY compares to The Ring in the chills department.

It goes in countdown form (first victim has room 10, second has room 9, etc.). Later on, the only ambitious twist of the movie occurs, and basically tears all emotional attachment to characters away - that's if you can ignore the wooden script and be attached to said characters.

Identity had real potential, if only the writers hadn't relied on every lame horror movie cliche and chosen to use a hackneyed plot ""twist"" (and I use that term very loosely) to finish the film with.

I found myself wondering why a fine actor like John Cusack would star in something like this, but I guess it was a job. Although the film's story line doesn't lack imagination, it is simply not believable. For me to explain why would be to reveal the ending. Like so many movies today, this one pushes the idea that ghosts and paranormal phenomena are real and that we should believe in them. If this film is a tribute to Alfred Hitchcock (as one commenter suggests), then all I can say is the makers pay him poor tribute. Hitchcock always grounded his films in unflinching realism. That is why he was a master. He relied only on human motivation and psychology to underpin the behavior of his characters. Nevertheless, he succeeded in chilling us to the bone without invoking the supernatural, preternatural, or any other beyond-the-natural, hogwash."

","IDENTITY (2003) CONTAINS SPOILERS<br/><br/>""Identity"" is a gripping, eventful movie and contains all the right ingredients and plot twists to make a good standard thriller. Problem is-the movie hasn't been shot as a 'standard' thriller and has basically tried to jazz itself up with a plot insert that is both unnecessary and unsatisfying. Comparisons can be made with the MPD twist in ""Fight Club"" which i again felt was unnecessary and detracted from the core of the movie in order to offer a final 'Twist'-that every studio seems to be demanding since 'Sixth Sense' hit! The difference between ""Fight Club"" and this movie is that without the MPD twist ""Identity"" is an extremely basic premise and has very little depth. I would liken this movie to a very basic economy car that has alloy wheels and a bodykit to disguise its origins. I could imagine studio executives saying ""Its good but we want a bigger twist-change it"". If you want to be entertained-go see this movie, if you want to be shocked and amazed-borrow Agent Smiths memory eraser in MIB and go rent Sixth Sense again! Without the final twist Cusack and Liotta would not have made this movie-and it probably wouldnt have been made full stop."
"yoyomagoo","Null","0","1","29 June 2003"," Irritating!
","While hardly going to be the worst film released this year, Identity is by no means decent. Starting off with a familiar, if entertaining premise it promises much but ultimately fails as both a horror film and as an excercise in audience manipulation. <br/><br/>The casting of Ray Liotta and John Cusack, however, is one of the film's strengths. The slightly eccentric decision pays dividends as some of the best scenes in the film involve confrontations between their two very different characters, allowing thespian sparks to fly. It also allows for the film to add a shade of humanity to its lean 90 minute running time. The rest of the cast is decent, with the possible exception of John C. McGinley who comes across as hammy in his supporting role.<br/><br/>Shot in dark, desaturated tones, Identity even looks the part of a good horror film. The use of weather to accentuate moods of the characters is as ever, a reliable device for tension while it also allows the charcters to meet- a nifty if standard plot device. It harks back to the Robert Zemekis film What Lies Beneath in its tribute to Hitchcock- a kind of neo-Hitchcock style, I guess it would be called.<br/><br/>However it is due to the unspeakably awful final 30 minutes, that this film comes across as underwhelming. In an age old trick, director Mangold, pulls the rug from the audience's feet leaving  a multitude of seemingly unanswerable questions for them to decipher. Yawn. Instead of coming across as scary, perplexing or even thought-provoking, the final section of the movie is frustrating, uneven and a con. The ending is so anti-climactic and ripped off that you feel like throwing a big brick at the screen and shouting obscenities at the ushers when you leave the multiplex.<br/><br/>Identity's first hour is fun, fairly tense, if familiar hokum. Then in act of extreme pretension the film launches into another genre and becomes unintentionally funny and desperate. See it, for the gory deaths and performances. Skip it, if you don;t want your intelligence to be insulted."

The ""surprise"" ending in this film is to put it bluntly, horrid. First, it's not a much of a surprise, since I figured it out in the first 5 minutes of the movie. Second, its VERY disappointing and seems more like a trick to get the screenwriters out of several plotholes they'd dug themselves into rather than attempt at making a good script. Third, the surprise happens 20 minutes from the end so it pretty much ruins the suspense, then the film drags on. In all fairness, this movie is well-acted and has great atmosphere. Unfortunately, the scriptwriters apparently ran out of ideas (ie: lost their Cliff Notes of 10 Little Indians)at the end. A very disappointing finish to what starts as a quite good movie. Despite the cheap trick ending to wrap things up, by the end of the film one is left with more plotholes than answers and a lingering sense of disappointment. Plot completely derails to the point enjoyment is easily cut in half. Predictable film and an awfully scripted ending make this film not recommended."

Which personality was 'running' the man with the disorder when Cusack's 'Ed' wasn't? Why didn't this personality appear at the Diner when Ed was in control of the man? How did the final woman's personality write in a diary when all the man with the disorder did is daydream her life? Why didn't any of the personalities say 'hey, wait a minute, who the hell else has been writing in my diary?'? When a multiple personality isn't evident in the person with a disorder it is not anywhere else, but is suppressed and hidden. When a personality is in control it's not like daydreaming, its actions are the actions of the person with the disorder. Etc, etc. Why didn't the writers not include a picture of the man with the disorder at the beginning and then make the film appear to be present day, but in fact be a flashback to when the original murders took place?

","While Identity is a very fun film, competently directed, and boasts an AWESOME cast of both stars and unknowns, there were three elements which did not work for me, personally.  The first of these was the photography.  So many times, in so many shots, I wanted to see more - more of the frame, more of Clea DuVall's lovely face, more of the rain, the motel, the diner. Especially, more of the geography of the place.  It would have been so much more terrifying to actually KNOW where the Ancient Indian Burial Ground was, in relation to everything else.<br/><br/>The second time I was painfully jarred out of the story was when Pruitt Taylor Vince (whom I last saw in Simone), during the midnight hearing, suddenly becomes John Cusack (whom the female demographic NEVER tires of seeing in anything, Serendipidy notwithstanding, and whom I will always remember first seeing in The Sure Thing).  It would have been a visually better choice to have him look in the mirror, and see John Cusack looking back, since the hearing scene takes place in the here-and-now, and all present only see P.T. Vince.<br/><br/>My final fault with Identity is in the treatment of the child, Timothy York, who is, sadly, not credited on imdb at all.  When he makes his reappearance, I cannot help but feel cheated.  A short scene, somehow differentiating his previous disposal from Clea DuVall's, would have been most welcome.<br/><br/>A very little bit about the performances:  Amanda Peet is her usual terrific self, Alfred Molina has still not given up the Diego Rivera accent, John Hawkes achieves quite a bit of scene-stealing in his, most memorable, portrayal of the impostor motel manager, and it is SO nice to see Rebecca DeMornay (so vastly underrated in Hand That Rocks the Cradle), replete with huge boobs and cute boots, stomping around in search of a cel phone signal.<br/><br/>Thank you for reading.

The jumps failed to appear as you could see the surprises coming more so in this venture than in many others I've seen.<br/><br/>It seems that this is all a little lazy in it's creation and is merely another conveyor churned movie, made for people who like their frights simple and their plot none too complicated. I'm sorry if I come across as highbrow, but I was really annoyed by this cheap imitation.<br/><br/>I'd like to say that there was some saving grace and that may have been the acting as Liotta, Peet and Cusack all performed admirably with the material they had been given, but even that is not enough to save it from drowning.<br/><br/>Implausable at best, it tries to convince you otherwise. If the film were to stick to reality or choose total fantasy, this may have come off better, but dressing it up as something it isn't won't fool anyone, I'm afraid.<br/><br/>I won't ruin the plot for you, as there is little enough of it to begin with, but suffice to say you won't have to work too hard to get the point.This would be ok if it wasn't trying to sell itself on it's own intelligent thriller status, which it certainly isn't.<br/><br/>5/10 (4 for the acting and 1 point for the rain)"

","I was greatly disappointed in the film.  It was impressively shot and showed interesting characters, particularly Cusack and Peet, and Liotta was very funny in his over the top portrayal, but ultimately the ending was so confusing as to bring no clarity to what was trying to be described.  The supposed killer could not have done some of the murders depicted.  I won't go further into that since it may be disappointing to potential viewers to find out.  Understanding that the killer couldn't have done the murders the film takes on the image of a fantasy.  I could accept it as a Stephen King type fantasy, but as not much more than that.  One minor note which properly goes in your mistakes area is that the supposedly Florida orange grove that Peet goes to has hills in the background which are higher than anything remotely suggesting a hill in Florida.  This scene was obviously shot in Southern California.  In away the film suggests ""Mulholland Drive"" in the complexity of the murders, but is nowhere as interesting or as thought provoking.  One of the few times I have been missled by a review in the LA Times."

","Once again American cinema falls victim to the old Hollywood ideology: If it made money before, why not again?  Four years ago The Sixth Sense started a trend of `intelligent shockers' that movie execs are still bleeding audiences with to this day.  Unfortunately, trying to bottle-up the magic of The Sixth and pass it off as something new usually leaves me with a Sense of repetitiveness and with Identity, wasted time.  A bad case of unbelievable happenchance finds ten strangers marooned in a roadside motel with no working phones and all roads leading out rendered useless by a raging storm.  One by one the unfortunate guests meet with grizzly demise without many clues to who the killer actually is.  The obvious suspect is the convict (Jake Busey), but as Ed (John Cusack) and Rhodes (Ray Liotta), the natural leaders of the group, try and find some answers, the bodies start to pile up and the identity of the killer becomes more mysterious and complex.  With strong performances from Cusack and Liotta and a perfectly eerie setting for a horror show, there was enough about James Mangold's Identity to keep me interested.  But by the end of the second act the writing takes a turn for the worst, or more accurately, a turn towards the familiar.  The way this movie plays out has been done countless times before and in better style.  And there in lies the problem: Why spend ninety minutes and nine bucks on a film that seems pointless and trite?  So if you like The Sixth Sense or The Ring or any other number of similarly formulated films I suggest renting your favorite intelligent-shocker/plot-twist flick and spend a night at home.

The story of how everybody gets to the hotel is kinda neat, and the little backgrounds that are given are sufficent, but my main complaint is that there are to many characters.  With too many characters, there is no real way to make any of these characters fully fleshed out and make us really care or hate them.  That combined with a weak cop out ending make this a film that you should see if you have nothing better to do.  Everything else is fine.

It is nothing more than a haphazard mish-mash of elements from several other movies, none of which retain any of their power. The screenwriter is actually ballsy enough to even throw in ""it was built on an Indian burial ground!"" as a red herring. And he's being serious!<br/><br/>This movie reinforces my belief that there must be a moratorium placed on stories about multiple personality disorder (MPD). It is a notion that Hollywood hacks have fallen in love with, largely because they are unimaginative and uncreative. Whenever a movie is advertised as having a ""twist"" nowadays, you can rest assured it will either be MPD, or that the main character is in fact a ghost. Give it a rest.<br/><br/>This film again reveals two major problems with Hollywood constructions: falling in love with a result and working backwards from it. Hack screenwriters love the MPD spin, because it lets them do all kinds of ""effective"" scenes and tricks, like showing one face while another voice is speaking. Spooky! The writer and director don't care how they get to the effect, they just want the result in their movie. It's like a demo reel, or a fisheye effect in a rap video. <br/><br/>The movie is not exciting, scary, or the least bit compelling. The horror is strict fright movie cliche (woman looking over her shoulder while walking forwards and bumping into someone she knows, people grabbing each other's shoulders and jumping, etc). And the MPD story is strictly by-the-numbers. If you've seen a movie before and have half a brain, you'll figure out the ending within 15 minutes. I spent more time counting plot holes and inconsistencies. The psychobabble may get the liberals yakking (although I'm not sure why it's okay to execute a sane murderer but not a crazy one, aren't they more dangerous?) The movie barely hits the 90 minute mark, including previews and credits, yet it still feels overlong.<br/><br/>

"secragt","6","0","1","29 April 2003"," Decent, but less than the sum of its parts
","Blessed with an intriguing hook, escalating suspense and a game ensemble cast, IDENTITY is ultimately more style than substance. This is not to say it is not diverting and largely entertaining. It's just also a bit of a cop out. Coming on the heels of no less than five recent movies featuring the same modus operandi of the cagey or otherwise unreliable narrator / narrative (MULHOLLAND DRIVE, THE USUAL SUSPECTS, FIGHT CLUB, THE MATRIX, SIXTH SENSE and even CUBE 2), IDENTITY is probably the least successful of the group in logically / cleverly integrating the gimmick. Coming so late in this plot device's cycle, one would have hoped for more than mostly nonsensical pseudo-psychological mumbo jumbo. Still, this is not to say that the movie isn't an enjoyable ride. It just doesn't go very far after promising a much greater journey.<br/><br/>SPOILERS<br/><br/>Like too many X-Files episodes, the movie sets up a clever challenge and hook which the climax and conclusion is never able to satisfyingly explain or resolve. A movie which owes a tremendous debt to PSYCHO, IDENTITY ultimately suffers the same anti-climactic letdown inflicted on us by Hitchcock. PSCYHO's five minute pop psychological soapbox soliloquy on cross dressing by Simon Oakland is matched by IDENTITY's similarly laughable lip service dissertation by the defense psychologist on how the entire movie we've been watching is the schizophrenic delusions of a sybillic patient. This longwinded and patronizing lecture on split personalities is almost as dated as Leslie Nielsen's ""Monsters of the Id"" deus ex machina from FORBIDDEN PLANET.<br/><br/>Much like FIGHT CLUB, another movie which relies heavily on the POV of an insane (in this case schizophrenic) protagonist, IDENTITY begins to lose steam just as it strains hardest to impress us with its twists. The problem is not that the story isn't ambitious. The problem is that the split personality twist is from out in left field and we are left bushwhacked, sidetracked and disappointed. It's a twist that we don't want to be true because it ruins the mystery that we hope will have a much better explanation.<br/><br/>Obviously the creators give a lot of thought to structuring the reveal and choreograph individuals' locations at the time of each murder such that any number of red herrings and solid suspects are available. At first Busey seems a great suspect. Then the motel manager. Then Ray Liotta. Then ghosts from the ""Indian Burial Ground."" There is much to admire in the first half hour, where we meet the ten characters efficiently and unpredictably. We see in nicely non-linear fashion how each player's actions contribute to the others' arrival at the remote motel where they will all ultimately die.<br/><br/>IDENTITY has plenty of jolts and some smartness. While it outsmarts itself at the end and gives in to a gimmicky finale, up to that point it is a divertingly creepy and intriguing road to nowhere."
"tpsill","Null","0","1","28 April 2003"," Disappointing..........
","....like a lot of the people that have already posted reviews about this picture, I had some expectations. Apparently my expectations were too high because this movie left me kind of annoyed and surely disappointed.<br/><br/>If you're reading the review you've probably read other reviews that stated exactly what the premise of the film is, so I'll leave that part out. I'm just going to state my thoughts.<br/><br/>While I wasn't dying to see this movie, I thought it looked interesting, it could be placed in any one of a few different genres that occasionally have the ability to captivate me, and the preview grabbed my attention. Also, it was Sunday night and I was bored. I was thinking maybe it had the ability to entertain me as did ""Frailty"", ""The Ring"", or ""Signs"". Mysterious, dark, complex, and satisfying when all was said and done. I was wrong.<br/><br/>ONLY READ THE REST IF YOU'VE SEEN IT!!!FOR YOUR OWN SAKE!!!<br/><br/>The way the ten characters show up at the motel is interesting and seemed to be a good sign. It was the total opposite of the old slasher type flicks such as ""Friday the 13th"", etc. Instead of just picking up at the motel and saying,'here are a bunch of people, all that matters is what happens once they're at the motel,' they took some time to show how they got to the motel and did so in an interesting fashion that gave the viewer some insight into the characters. Good start.<br/><br/>Once at the motel it quickly turns into a slasher flick, hence the earlier ""Friday the 13th"" reference. One character gets killed, then another, then another. Gee, have I seen this before? It shows some interesting death scenes (I enjoyed the baseball bat down the throat) and you are supposed to wonder who the killer is. Is it the obvious suspect in the escaped convict? Is it Larry (was that his name?) the operator of the motel? If you wasted your time trying to figure it out, there's no point. In a movie like this the obvious is used merely as a way to throw you off. You know the movie isn't about an escaped convict pulling a 'Jason' and murdering everybody. It isn't about the motel operator (not really) doing the same thing. Hopefully that didn't trick anybody. Yet, at that point I was okay with where the film was headed. While it may have been a little too slasher-esque, I figured the forthcoming surprise ending would take over and make up for it. I was wrong.<br/><br/>So, as you're watching the murder fest at the motel they splice in the scenes with the death row hearing. After all, that is where the movie started and the two stories must tie together somehow, right? By now there are, what, four people (?) left at the motel when the car explodes and everybody that should be dead in the corner, or dead with a bat down their throat, or dead on the bed disappears!?! Now we are confused a bit. The room keys with the numbers was kind of exciting. 10...9...8...7...6...etc. It was cool, but it goes nowhere and, as I said, we are confused or maybe just waiting to see what's going on. Climax please.<br/><br/>Next thing John Cusack is in the wheelchair where the mentally unstable death row guy should be. Are we confused? Not really. We know the guy had multiple personalities, that's why the hearing is taking place. Therefore most of us figure out almost immediately that John Cusack is just one of his personalities. Now the ball is rolling and we soon learn that the whole motel deal is just in the death row guys head. It isn't people killing each other, but his personalities doing so and in the end one peaceful, happy personality will be left. Yippee!<br/><br/>That is basically where the film loses me. I understood it fine, but at that point I didn't care because the motel crap wasn't real and who cares which personality will win? Sure, the death row guy killed people in reality which is why he's on death row. However, the entirety of the motel sequences in the movie become moot at that point. They are personalities, not people. Who cares.<br/><br/>The ending. Amanda Peet's character is the one left standing and everything is okay. Wrong! The little boy personality is evil and kills her, takes over Mr. I-used-to-be-going-to-death-row-now-I'm-going-to-a-mental-hospital and he kills the doctor (sort of a ""Primal Fear"" moment, but not nearly as good). That was better than him assuming Peet's personality, but it doesn't save the movie.<br/><br/>SPOILERS NOW FINISHED!!!<br/><br/>In the end, as I said in the beginning, I was disappointed. The slasher stuff made me lose some respect for the movie since I knew it was trying to be a psychological thriller. And the ending ultimately makes that stuff moot. Don't mistake an elaborate script or story for a suspenseful thriller with twists and turns. The film lacks an overall flow and the idea of multiple personalities, etc. is taken in the wrong direction. The idea behind it all is still good, but the potential is not realized in this movie. Another place where the people that made this film got it wrong is that you don't need constant action and thrills to make a film suspenseful. Look at ""Frailty"" or ""Signs"" or anything Hitchcock. They were very good to great movies in my book and they managed to do so much with pretty simple story lines and not a ton of action. If you thought those films were slow then you may like this movie. However, it just goes to show what happens when Hollywood gets a hold of a script like ""Identity"" and makes it instead of letting M. Night Shyamalan or Bill Paxton (yes, that Bill Paxton) make a mysterious movie the way it should be made.<br/><br/>I won't stop anybody from seeing this and hold nothing against those who enjoyed it. I just thought it could have been better. I asked a couple people when the last time they saw a bad John Cusack movie was in my effort to support my decision to see it. I wouldn't call ""Identity"" bad, but it wasn't good either.<br/><br/>Grade: 5-1/2 out of ten."

You can find out what the twist is in the paragraph above, and that's the only interest to be had here.<br/><br/>Anyway, the movie was a decent slasher film until a bit before the twist, when many seams in logic are starting to show. John Cusack is VERY good. Amanda Peet was also very good, which is nice to see cause I like her, but all I've ever seen her do is be a--ahem--""unpleasant woman"" who bosses men around, though in one variation she gets to OD on heroin. Clea Duvall--boy, she sure can cry. Liotta is good, though is role is so rote it doesn't matter much.<br/><br/>An example of where a twist like this has actually WORKED is in the small English movie PAPERHOUSE. But I think the crucial element is that it isn't set up as the huge surprise, you know it from the beginning (and hence don't feel betrayed). In it, a young girl draws a picture of a house. Then she falls asleep, and GOES to the house. It is exactly as she draws it--meaning that when she draws a boy in the window, his legs hidden behind the wall, that when she meets him he doesn't have the use of his legs. It gets scary, because the girl is sick and has fainting spells, having no control over when she gets sucked into her dangerous dream world. <br/><br/>Anyway, if you ask me, stay away, but other people seem to like it, so...<br/><br/>--- Check out website devoted to bad and cheesy movies: www.cinemademerde.com"

Until the plot twist, the film is in my mind taut, suspenseful, and gripping.

","-- Spoiler Alert --<br/><br/>First of all, don't compare it with The Ring or other so-called supernatural movies, because there is nothing supernatural about it. Although far-fetched, it basically makes sense, and it is more of a horror/sci-fi kind of thriller. Personally I don't think it is very scary (not nearly as scary as Scream), because most of the time my mind was focused on observing the people trying to figure out who dunnit.<br/><br/>Identity is likely one of the best thrillers ever, with good story line and multiple twists. I sort of guessed after the first death that it was either the cop (typical bad guy image) or the kid although the latter was more likely (more spooky). This is the part where it is kind of predictable. However, it is not THAT predictable when the double twists came out. The scene where Rivers was taken away in the car reminded me of Eward Norton's Primal Fear and I was almost disappointed that it would be somewhat like that where he was faking it all along. But it turned to be a better version, predicatable, but better.<br/><br/>The only complaint I have about the movie is that the woman (mother) who was supposed to die was a bad actress. When John Cusack closed her eyes, her neck was obviously pulsating. Such a glaring mistake should have been avoided.<br/><br/>Nonetheless, it is highly recommended, especially when there is virtually nothing in today's cinema that is worth the money and time."

","Identity takes two or three of the most ludicrous plots you've never seen, twines them together in a ball of yarn, dips it all in a bucket of atmospheric goop and calls it a psychological thriller.<br/><br/>Well, it is, quite literally, a psychological thriller, though its version of psychology is so far removed from real human mental activity that it leaves the unfolding of the drama seeming mechanical, arbitrary and yet predictable (in other words: written).<br/><br/>The less said about the plot, the better, both in order to avoid inevitable spoilers, and because the story gets off to a contrived start, then meanders downhill into the realm of the silly.  Generally speaking, though, this is a film that plants itself proudly at the head of the Too-Clever-by-Half crowd. Along with Memento, The Sixth Sense, and other assorted half-baked postmodern thrillers of the past 5 years, it makes the fatal error of thinking that the secret to a good thriller is to outsmart the audience.

The film does manage to sustain a kind of jumpy nervousness that has to count as some kind of accomplishment compared to, say, the boredom that overtakes one midway through The Sixth Sense, but it is in its insistence on sustaining that feeling through every homogenously gloomy, rainsoaked scene of the film that the director reveals how little he understands the genre...how little modern Hollywood understands, in fact, the genre. Hitchcock demonstrated over 40 years ago that the magic ingredient to the great thriller was the seemingly banal patina of modern life from which the director would manage to extract one unexpected horror after another (whether Norman Bates' mother or the Birds of Bodega Bay).  Identity lacks even a single scene that could be said to reside in that everyday world. Every scene is filmed like a climax, with dripping gutters, howling winds, distraught heroes, and the flinty scrapes of knives slipping in between ribs.  It takes the insistent, homogenous aesthetic of a television commercial and plays it out for two hours.  All that's missing is Catherine Zeta-Jones showing up with a working T-mobile cell phone at key moments in the plot and you'd have a heck of a marketing blitz.  I'm not convinced, however, that this is why we go to the movies, when we go to the movies."

","This movie is influenced by Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho.  A 03's version, with quite a few twists.  If you watch the film carefully you see, clues for the ending.  I caught a few, and missed others.  Nice to see something fresh, without a social message.  A film about what just is.  Interesting, but sad, I wonder if such things really happen?<br/><br/>9 out of 10"
"williamknott","5","0","2","26 April 2003"," A Gimmick Movie (contains spoiler)
","""Identity"" is a gimmick movie disguised as a whodunit.  It isn't even a scary movie.  It's an intellectual puzzle at best and really not that engaging.  I knew what was going on almost immediately.  The first time I stopped to think, ""Why are they showing us this scene that seems to have nothing to do with the rest of the movie?,"" I realized there was only one thing that could explain what was happening:  none of it was real, it was all being made up in someone's mind.  I sat there for half the movie waiting for that to be revealed, and then when it was revealed, the movie kept going to a conclusion that was silly.  Despite the strong cast, never once during the movie did I care about what was going to happen.  Watch a movie like the ""Sixth Sense"" instead and feel the tension, feel how you don't want to look at what's going to happen next.  Now that's tension.  Nothing like that happens here.  People get killed and it's about as shocking as watching a character in a video game get killed.  And when the secret of what's really going on is revealed, I think many people will feel cheated."
"soonerpike697","5","0","1","26 April 2003"," Amazing what else can I say?
","This film is amazing.  It began as a very very entertaining who dunit/ horror flick.  Yet when it seemed it was just going to be just a little above average it took everyone for the ultimate loop.  I love this film I think the entire cast is amazing considering what their roles ultimately are.  This film makes you think you have it figured out, and then makes you start all over rethinking everything you've seen up to the point of epiphany. This is one DVD I will definitely own.  Great acting, great screenplay, and great directing.  I hope this movie gets the box office gross it deserves because everyone should see this flick.  This film will be one I watch and recommend for a long long time."
"lessofmichel","4","0","1","25 April 2003"," Not quite what I thought It would be
","I'm a big fan of thriller/suspense films.  Plus I'll go see anything with John C.   The film had some great slasher/killing scenes.  Even with those highlights   overall it was  quite a dull movie.  The ending wrapped up the movie tightly.  But when you left there was no excitement to speak of or discuss."
"DizzyDitz","5","0","2","25 April 2003"," A good idea buried in 4000 miles of bad ideas
","This movie seems to be a common thriller, but there is something novel in it. A good plot twist saves it, but it cannot save the annoyingly predictable thriller bits before it. Many people meet in a motel...and madness ensues. Things twist upon their own stakes about a million times. That is not meant to be taken literally. You will be surprised, but this move is in the end only okay, and my guess is that if you show this movie to a lot of people, that will be their reaction."
"movieguy1021","8","0","1","25 April 2003"," Identity: 8/10
","In the beginning of Identity, a series of bizarre coincidences bring ten strangers, including Ed (John Cusack), a limo driver for Caroline Suzanne (Rebecca De Mornay), Det. Rhodes (Ray Liotta), transporting a criminal, and George York (John C. McGinley), with his son Timothy (Bret Loehr), and injured wife Alice (Leila Kenzle). As torrential rain pours down in the middle of desert Nevada, people start dying in weird ways, and everyone has to stay safe.<br/><br/>In the middle of the time of Darkness Falls and House of 1000 Corpses, here comes an intelligent, mostly original horror films that tries to go back to the hey-day of Friday the 13th and the like. It has some gruesome murders, some good scares, some cheap scares, good acting, and a great ending.<br/><br/>The MPAA states that Identity is rated R for `strong violence and language.' The violence wasn't that strong, but some of the images were horrific, such as the one in that shed (I won't say any more). I'm glad that there's a horror movie that a) doesn't go for the teenager, PG-13 crowd, or b) goes for the all-out gore. It was also scary for a lot of the time, although it made me jump some times, going for cheap scares. A lot of times, I thought there would be one when there actually wasn't one.<br/><br/>Cusack was convincing as a limo driver, he's a good actor to begin with, and here's just another one of his movies. Liotta, who usually doesn't do much for me, was good, although he can't really sway from being a cop. Amanda Peet, who played a hooker named Paris, put in another outstanding acting job, proving her versatility. She can do slapstick comedy (The Whole Nine Yards), drama (Igby Goes Down), and now scary horror films. McGinley was had me believed that he was a worrying husband, although I didn't recognize him. Maybe I have his image from Office Space in my mind.<br/><br/>For some unknown reason, the ending of Identity reminded me of the ending of Vanilla Sky. They both explained a lot at the end, although in the latter, there were still questions, while here I understood everything. I thought it made perfect sense, and the last scene is priceless. It will keep you guessing, with different thoughts as you go through it, and, I can assure you, none of them will be right.<br/><br/>Music makes or breaks a movie, and here, it makes. It adds complete tension to many scenes, although it is basic and stereotypical horror music. The characters were all weird, and comes from those characters one of my favorite lines: `You aren't pregnant? Then why the hell did we get married?' I really enjoyed Identity, it is a creepy and fun ride that you probably won't forget for a while.<br/><br/>My rating: 8/10<br/><br/>Rated R for strong violence and language."
"Agent10","7","0","1","25 April 2003"," This film needs to figure out what it wants to be
","I will say off the top, Identity is a decent film that was well put together and is worth the price of admission. However, the film tends to take on too many personas in the process, concluding in a explosion of different genres and styles. While the film did have some very interesting ideas, it tried cramming too many within the 90-minute run time. Maybe if they had stayed on one straight line, it would have garnered an 8/10 from me. However, the film is worth seeing, but I would call it more a thriller than a horror film."
"james.abbott","4","0","2","25 April 2003"," Ridiculously bad
","I just got back from seeing ""Identity."" What a letdown!<br/><br/>I've heard it called a smart psychological thriller, but to me it was really more of a lame horror flick filled with plot twists that don't work. You get totally involved in the story and with the characters only to have all your expectations come crashing down.<br/><br/>I don't want to give too much away but, I'm sorry, the end seemed more like a last ditch effort to have everything ""make sense"" than a clever plot device. It was like the writers dug themselves a hole that they couldn't get out of so POOF! they explained it all away with one absurd ""shocker.""<br/><br/>I realize the effect they were going for but I found myself rolling my eyes towards the end. I expected so much more from such a fantastic cast.<br/><br/>A big waste of time."

","My friend didn't like it as much as I did... but he's wrong. A fun psychological horror movie is always welcome in my book! Especially if John Cusack is involved. Go in with no preconceptions and you will have fun!"
