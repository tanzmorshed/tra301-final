"MR_Heraclius","10","44","46","15 February 2020"," Best animated movies ever made
","More thematically compelling and with better action set-pieces, Toy Story 2 is a sequel that is just as good as the original - and one that isn't afraid to go to the more emotional side of storytelling."
"bapper","9","115","132","24 February 2000"," Pixar is improving: near perfect...
","I just saw Toy Story 2 an hour ago and I must say that, despite all the great reviews, I was still surprised about the quality....It started absolutely marvellous; one of the greatest and humorous opening sequences ever. The plot is really smart, the animation is brilliant and the humor...Oh man! The last 50 minutes must be the most fun 50 minutes I had in years and believe me, I'm NOT exaggerating. It seems impossible to imagine the fun the writers must have had, because this is a true film-fest whether you do like  Disney-esque films or don't.<br/><br/>Having this fast-paced storyline, John Lasseter & Co. exploited it to a maximum. Cameo's from Pixar-characters (Geri's the coolest), unexpected and obliged references to other big films (really love the Jurrasic Park one), great new characters (Wheezy!!), and more jokes and gags rammed in an animated feature than you'll ever see and of course the out takes.<br/><br/>The action-department is also greatly represented in some astonishing sequences with great, original shots and angles. The music is moody and Randy Newman is at his best with the really non-disturbing, appropriate song about Jessie, which is definitely the message of this film.<br/><br/>O.K., I know I'm raving, but I really meant it when I chose the ten and clicked the ""Vote"" button. This film is great and I recommend it to every film-lover.<br/><br/>A few downsides (this hardly affects the overall film) are I think, first of all the lack of originality, which is excusable and acceptable for a sequel. Second, the still somewhat jerky animation of the humans (I know they said it was supposed to be, but I disagree that). And third: the ratio, 1:1,85 (I thought it was the theater, but Pixar is forgiven, seen the quality of the film.) These are minors things and my decision is final, Toy Story 2 is certainly included in my top 20.<br/><br/>O.K., now you may stand up and ring a friend to go and see it, come on!!"
"Tallgent","9","93","108","5 March 2000"," Much more than a kid's movie
","The first Toy Story was largely confined to little Andy's room and his dreaded neighbor's house.  When we pick up the story in ""Toy Story 2,"" Buzz Lightyear is in outer space where he meets his arch-nemesis, Emperor Zurg. In a cheeky opening, the rules devised by Lasseter and his Pixar staff are laid out:  There are no rules.<br/><br/>Buzz flies through caverns, enters Zurg's stronghold, and gets defeated (gasp) by the evil Zurg!  Is this the end of our hero?....Nah, it's just Rex playing the Buzz Lightyear video game and losing.  It is Yard Sale Day and the toys are understandably tense.  You see, Yard Sale Day means that the old toys go out to the sale.  Woody has reason to be nervous, he's starting to show his age.  He's got a ripped arm thanks to Andy's dog, whom we got introduced to at the end of the first Toy Story.  Sure enough, one of the toy troop gets taken. Poor Weezie the Penguin was laid forgotten on Andy's bookcase and he promptly gets put in the sale box.  It's up to Woody to save him, which he does.  But he gets picked up by a greedy toy-collector named Al and taken to Al's Toy Barn.  Seems Woody is pretty valuable and Al wants to sell him to a toy auction.  Can Buzz and friends save him in time?<br/><br/>Ho-hum, sounds like a harmless little kid's movie, doesn't it?  But remember Lassetter and the rules, or lack thereof?  Well, things take quite a poignant turn.<br/><br/>In a magical sequence that's an homage to Howdy-Doody, Woody learns that he was part of an old 1950s children's puppet show along with some other toys from the show, the salty Prospector Pete (Kelsey Grammar), Jessie the Yodelling Cowgirl (played brilliantly by Joan Cusack), and Woody's faithful steed.  As Pete tells Woody, toy collecting means immortality.  Woody and his new friends will be preserved in cases for admiring eyes to faun over. Woody's days with Andy are numbered.  This point is further emphasized by a heartbreaking song sung by Sarah Maclachlan that tells the story of how Jessie's owner abandoned her because, well, she grew up.  Pete says, ""Do you really think Andy will take you to his high school graduation or to college?""  Talk about a bind.  Does Woody go back to Andy and have fleeting fun or stay preserved in predictable permanence?<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Andy's gang have their own awakenings to paths not taken.  Mr. Potato Head sees temptation incarnate in some friendly Barbies (""I'm a married spud!  I'm a married spud!"") and Buzz comes face to face with a new Buzz Lightyear figure....who turns out to be as self-delusional as he was. You mean, they're all like this?!  And the knockout punch: Buzz faces his mortal foe, Emperor Zurg and confronts a shattering secret.  Hint:  Think ""Star Wars.""<br/><br/>Pixar has come a long way since the first ""Toy Story.""  The computer animation is absolutely amazing as the toys have much more dimension and realism in the details than the original.  Once again everyone is terrific, especially Cusack who injects soul in the spunky and slighted Jessie. References abound, from ""2001"" to ""Star Wars.""  Plus some inside jokes concerning Toy Story's lack of merchandise production also make their way. Even a sly suggestive joke or two slips in.  Hint:  Watch Buzz's wings at the end.<br/><br/>I cannot say enough about one sequence in particular with Buzz and the gang crossing the street.  Lasseter directs this scene with great skill and comic placement.  I was in tears at this point, and this was a ""kid's"" movie!<br/><br/>But, as with the first one, what really got me engaged was the story, as affecting a story as I have seen live or animated.  If I can make an outlandish statement, Toy Story seems to be reaching for something akin to the ""Star Wars Trilogy"" or even the ""Godfather Trilogy.""  Not so much for epicness, but for how the story gets deeper and richer as it goes along. ""Star Wars"" was an entertaining space opera, ""Empire Strikes Back"" was a mythic, dark, operatic chapter in a saga.  ""Godfather"" was an exciting and classically-influenced masterwork, ""Godfather Part II"" was a quiet, dark, character study that reveals Michael's moral bankruptcy and the decline of the Corleone empire.<br/><br/>Lasseter's plan intrigues me.  With ""Toy Story"", the plot revolved around a buddy picture that showed the bond between an old toy and new toy, and that being a toy is the best thing in the world.  This bittersweet second chapter addresses what happens after the toys aren't needed anymore.  What happens now?  Where will I go?  Will I be loved again?  I wonder if with the third, if there is one, we'll see what makes a toy timeless.  What separates a Woody or Buzz from Rex the Dinosaur or Slinky the Dog?  And I wonder what the ultimate fate of our friends actually is.  I'm hoping they get passed on to Andy's children and his grandchildren, throughout all the generations. I wouldn't worry about Buzz and Woody, though.  They're already timeless."
"keyoar","10","77","92","24 November 1999"," A great sequel
","This has to be by far one of the cleanest and most well-designed movie to come from any studio for a while now. The plot is trim and concise and this film is not just for kids, there are plenty of grown-up themes to satisfy even critical viewers. The animation is tremendous, especially if you pay attention to the details, and the cameo from Geri and the underlying Star Wars spoofs are just great. All in all, one of the best films I've seen to date. Just one disappointment, no outtakes during the credits. But still, I don't think I'll forget this one for a while, if you get a chance to see it in the cinemas don't miss it..."
"Atouk","10","72","87","6 December 1999"," Funny, Exciting and Thoughtful: What more do you want?
","PIXAR has done the impossible, and significantly improved on their original groundbreaking film Toy Story. Not only is the movie hysterically funny, but every time I thought I knew where the plot was headed something completely new and original was thrown into the mix. One minute I'm laughing hysterically at ""Tour Guide"" Barbie, the next I'm nearly brought to tears watching a sequence where Emily grows up and leaves Jessie behind.<br/><br/>What more can be said? If you think you're too old to enjoy something like this then I feel sorry for you, because this film has more to say about friendship, loss, loyalty and the value of life itself than any of the so-called ""grown up"" movies I've seen this year.<br/><br/>I rarely do this, but I'm rating this one a ""10""."
"Movie-12","9","48","60","11 January 2000"," Entertains adults just as much as it will children. One of the years best films. ***1/2 out of ****
","TOY STORY 2 (1999) ***1/2<br/><br/>With the voices of: Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, Kelsey Grammer, Joan Cusack, Jim Varney, & Wayne Knight Director: John Lasseter   Running time: 85 minutes   Rated G<br/><br/>By Blake French: <br/><br/>	In an era where audiences are given such few family movies, and in a time where such films are seldom given decent scripts, ""Toy Story 2"" is a jolt of lightening in the fast fading genre of unobjectionable entertainment. Over the past several years we've received filmmaker's poor attempts at granting us enjoyment with an orphaned raised by jungle apes, bouncy green slime, a massive gorilla reeking havoc on a major city, a child fending off robbers by himself near Christmas, a small boy's attempts to rescue a battered dog from his cruel owner, a canine playing football, a colony of ants in trouble, a talking mouse, and even a film version of an old cartoon about a man filtered with countless gizmos. None of those desperate family tales work. I think you can understand through these examples that when a great children's film does finally open, and entertains adults equally as much as it mesmerizes its target audience I give it the honor of being one of the years best movies. <br/><br/>	""Toy Story 2"" continues the traditional lives of the characters brought to our attention in the original movie released in 1995. What makes ""Toy Story"" unique is the fact that the characters are mostly toys. The familiar faces include everyone's favorite cowboy Woody, Buzz Lightyear, Hamm the piggy bank, Mr. Potato Head, Rex the cowardly Tyrannosaurs Rex, the Army Sergeant, Little Bo Peep, and the Slinky Dog. The sequel film introduces several new characters in its presence consisting of Prospector Pete, Jessie the Cowgirl, and antagonists, a  greedy human named Big Al and robotic video game figure called Zurg. The plot has to do with several of the toys rescue attempts to save Woody from a money hungry thief who intends to sell him to a different country.<br/><br/>Just a few days ago I screened the somewhat similar, although unsuccessful, family comedy ""Stuart Little."" That movie failed because it attempted to blend our human world with the likes of pure fictional fantasy; a talking mouse that acts like a human. It is hard to except something like that without an explanation--giving the filmmakers no choice but to get into a complicated, logical explanation that would bore the majority of an audience. ""Toy Story 2"" needs none of that explication. It contains its illusion outside of our world, creating a tale that inspires our imagination. The filmmakers do not try to compare the likes of toys being alive with reality. It creates its own atmosphere which seems unfamiliar and magical. It is a place that lives within our dreams; everyone has hoped for their toys to come alive at one time or another. ""Toy Story 2"" brings this world to life to the quality of the original ""Toy Story."" This movie is a landmark in the gender of animated family comedies that should be treasured for all that its worth. <br/><br/>Brought to you by Walt Disney Pictures."
"Outworld-3","10","47","59","2 February 2000"," To Infinity and Beyond ?
","Well it's a sequel, and I watched with trepidation, and glad to say I enjoyed every minute of this, it was good to see the voices of all the characters still voiced by the original actors/actresses, as well as welcoming new characters 'Stinky Pete the Prospector' and the Round-up gang, as well as a nemesis for Buzz !  Some very 'tounge in cheek' movie gags (Jurassic Park and Star Wars to name but two).  I would hope in years to come to see more quality productions like this.<br/><br/>This will be a family favourite again."
"jwisdom","10","48","63","2 December 1999"," Wonderful, imaginative film
","This film is definitely a pleasure and a joy to see, a very well done sequel.  I wouldn't be surprised if it would spawn yet another sequel, raising the bar even more for computer animation, such as this film has done.  Toy Story 2 looks even more lifelike and realistic than its original, I found myself several times 'forgetting' that it was computer animation. Definitely a must see for all ages."
"cinatyte","10","84","115","24 November 1999"," Better than the original
","I thought the original Toy Story was great.  I went to this movie hardly knowing anything about it.  Toy Story 2 exceeded my expectations; it's better than the original Toy Story.  This movie works on two levels.  It's aimed at younger kids, who will love the wackiness of the characters and the situations they find themselves in, though some of the jokes might sail over their heads (but they'll laugh anyway).  It's also aimed at adults, who, when I saw it, laughed louder than the kids at some points.  The voice work is excellent, especially Tom Hanks and Tim Allen, reprising their roles from the original.  The supporting toys (Mr. Potato Head, Slinky Dog, et al.) have much bigger roles this time around.<br/><br/>This movie has everything: Andy's new dog Buster; two dueling Buzz Lightyears; partying Barbie dolls; three 3-eyed aliens from the original; even the Evil Emperor Zurg!  I can't emphasize enough how great this movie is and I highly recommend it for kids and adults.<br/><br/>10/10"
"tfrizzell","Null","39","51","5 January 2002"," Another Instant Classic From Disney
","""Toy Story 2"" is equal to its predecessor. Some may say it is better (I am not sure about that) but it is on par with the original. This time Woody is stolen by a greedy toy collector and it is up to Buzz Lightyear and their friends to rescue him. The film is great-looking, the voice characterizations are all perfect and the film's screenplay is so intelligent that ""Toy Story 2"" would have been successful under the worst of circumstances. 5 stars out of 5."
"Polaro","7","6","6","13 December 1999"," Not as good as the first one.
","Toy Story 2 is just not as funny or as clever as the first Toy Story. There seems to be lots of filler (ie. needless action and chases) and not enough witty interaction between the characters. Even the voice performances seem to be a little lackluster. Still, I laughed out loud more than a few times and was only slighty bored in the middle section."
"ccthemovieman-1","10","58","83","21 April 2006"," Even Better Than The First 'Toy Story'
","Here's yet one more sequel that more than lived up to its original great start. The first Toy Story was outstanding. This is just as good, if not better.<br/><br/>Very fast-paced and very entertaining, this doesn't have a lot of laugh-out-loud parts but is definitely fun to watch with many good lines. What I appreciated was the lack of a nasty villain and any evil overtones, as was the case with the rotten neighborhood kid in the first film.<br/><br/>I also appreciated the fantastic surround sound on the DVD, along with the magnificent colors. Not to be forgotten is a wonderful, tear-jerking song in here, sung by Sarah MacLaclan. It gets to me every time.<br/><br/>When you factor in all the nice characters, music, colors and sounds, this has to be one of the most beloved animated films of the modern era."

","Toy Story 2 (1999): Dir: John Lasseter, Ash Brennon, Colin Brody / Voices: Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, Joan Cusack, Kelsey Grammar, Wayne Knight: Wonderful sequel that is even better than the first landmark film. It flourishes with originality and detail. Woody the cowboy doll and Space Ranger Buzz Lightyear return as the central toys. Woody anticipates Cowboy Camp with his owner Andy but a tear in his shoulder has him left on the shelf. A sudden yard sale calls for the rescue of another toy but in the process he is nabbed by greedy Al of Al's Toy Barn. We learn that Woody was part of the Roundup Gang, which was a canceled T.V. show. He is united with Bulls-eye the horse, prospector Stinky Pete and Jessica the high spirited female counterpart to Woody. During the search and rescue Buzz encounters another Buzz Lightyear as well as his arch enemy. John Lasseter returns as director accompanied by Ash Brannon and Colin Brody. Tom Hanks and Tim Allen return to voice Woody and Buzz. Joan Cusack steals scenes voicing Jessica whose musical segment involving her past is perhaps the most heartfelt moment in the film. Kelsey Grammar voices Stinky Pete who is contained in a box. Wayne Knight is hysterical as the human villain Al from Al's Toy Barn. One of the best sequels one could ask for. It is an animated joy ride about heritage and friendship. Score: 9 / 10"
"Chrysanthepop","Null","9","11","22 March 2008"," Cute Toys Are Back With A Bang For More Adventure
","It's been about a decade since I last saw 'Toy Story'. Thus, it would be unfair to compare that with 'Toy Story 2'. Pixar has produced numerous gems since the first 'Toy Story'. This one is a sheer delightful adventure and it's not one that is only limited to entertaining children. There are the charming characters from the old one and some wonderful new characters that include the energetic Jessie the Yodelling Cowgirl, the hot barbies and Woody's faithful and hyper steed. The animation is superb and looks refreshing. The story too takes a new turn that presents the dilemma of whether one should live an eternal life of wealth and security or an unpredictable life that at least promises a few years of love. The actors do a fine job lending their voice. Hanks and Allen are back as Woody and Buzz and Joan Cusack is a treat as the vivacious Jessie. But I must add that I loved Buzz's gang that includes the hilarious Rex and the lovable Slinky, the resourceful Mr. Potatohead and the cute Hamm, and their attempts to rescue Woody and bring him back home. There's a beautiful song by Sarah Mclachlan that dictates Jessie's pain. The sequel being a huge hit just proves how timeless the characters are and I want to see 'Toy Story' again just to follow the whole story. It's already been a decade since, but I wonder whether they'll make a sequel and what the fate of our toy friends will be once Andy has grown up. 'Toy Story 2' is an unforgettable adventure with a beautiful soul."
"cbobs","10","5","6","30 May 2019"," The Perfect Sequel!!!
","Yet again this film is amazing. While i may prefer the Toy Story one, i still absolutely love this film with all my heart and it yet again expands upon the world created and introduces new characters. Jessie being the fun cowgirl with a sad past after she was left behind by her owner Emily. This was a great addition to the cast with Jessie now being just as recognizable as Woody and Buzz. For me, this film is the most fun out of the trilogy.<br/><br/>One thing i did enjoy about this film was yet again the creativity. Especially, revolving around Buzz and co trying to rescue Woody from Al's Toy Barn. The creativity in this film might even be better than in the first as they could explore this world even more without it ruining the film too much. The main plot was with Woody, Jessie and Stinky Pete so the other scenes could just be whatever they wanted it to be. That's why they work so well. They use so much creativity around everyday objects to explain how the toys would be able to reach Woody. The traffic cones, elevator and air vents.<br/><br/>Some of the best scenes include the traffic cone sequence. The tense scene where the toys have to get across the road underneath traffic cones. When Mr Potato head gets his foot stuck on the gum and has to come back for it before he is crushed to death. Certain tropes from the original are repeated in a different way and actually work. We get
to see another Buzz who doesn't believe that he is a toy. This is revealed in the comedic line from real Buzz ""Did i really used to sound like that?"". However, the scene on the elevator when Buzz believes he is flying but really just standing at the top of the elevator is hilarious. Then there's The Empire Strikes Back style scene with Zurg telling Buzz that he is his father. That is my favorite scene in the entire film. Probably because TESB is my favorite film of all time. But i also liked Rex finally defeating Zurg by knocking him off the elevator.<br/><br/>The most emotional scene in the entire film by far is Jessie's backstory. The song playing in the background combined with the emotional imagery of Jessie being forgotten and neglected before finally being put in a box and sold. This is also where Woody learns that Andy isn't going to be there forever and that's why he is prepared to go to Tokyo with Jessie and Stinky Pete. It seems Pete is destined to be part of a collection and has almost brainwashed Jessie into wanting to do the same thing. It was also great to learn about Woody's backstory and where the character came from. The popular 1950's TV show that he had that was cancelled after the idea of spacemen and astronauts took over in children's entertainment. The scenes with Woody looking through his merchandise and him, Jessie and Bullseye dancing around on the record were great. Another creative scene in the film is the cheese puff minefield. Woody creeping up on Al, trying to get his arm back but his facial expressions when he burps are amazing.<br/><br/>The airport scenes are also spectacular and gives the film a great finale. Woody finding Jessie and getting her to come with him was such a heartfelt moment and they finally get to find out what would have happened in the next episode of Woody's roundup. It was great to see Woody finally accept the fact that Andy may not be around forever so he has to do his duty and serve him well in the limited time they had left. I mean, when a film makes you feel for inanimate objects, you know it's great storytelling.<br/><br/>So, Toy Story 2 is an amazing sequel that expands upon the world the first film had started and yet again uses it's creativity to tell a great story.
""But i don't wanna move my head!!!!!!"""
"ironhorse_iv","8","5","6","25 March 2013"," When somebody love this movie, everything is beautiful
","Every hour we spent together, lives within my heart. Woody and the gang are back in one of the best sequels ever made: Pixar's Toy Story 2. Here's something interesting. This film was originally a direct to video movie. But while in the process of making it, they realized how good it was turning out and decided to make it an theatrical movie. Thank Goodness, Pixar saw something in it, rather than continue the Disney's awful sequels cycle. The Pixar folks didn't want ""drop"" everything for the direct-to-video version. They make a brand-new story for the theatrical release because they wanted to; there was pressure from Disney to do a direct to video due to save money. The Pixar folks were sensing impending doom because they didn't know what to do, and as a last resort John Lasseter was called in from his long overdue vacation to fix the movie in time for its release. The process was rushed, messy, and nerve-wracking. But by God did it all pay off in the end!! Who knew that Toy Story 2 would partially lead to Disney's fall out with Pixar a few years later. Anyways the idea for the opening of this film was the original idea for the opening of Toy Story, only instead of a video game, it's a TV show. But the makers decided to scrap that idea and open the movie with play action with Andy, because they wanted to establish the bond between Andy and Woody in Toy story. Then when they made Toy story 2, they decided to bring back that idea only make it a video game. Still, that one impression video game for an early 2000's video game. My N64 and Playstation couldn't even be that good. The toys in Andy's room has just witness Woody (Tom Hanks) getting stolen by toy collector Al (Wayne Knight). Now Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen) must sent a rescue mission to save him. While at the same time at Al's penthouse, Woody finds out how much he is value, and thinks about being display in a toy museum along with Woody's Roundup pals Jessie (Joan Cusack) and Stinky Pete (Kelsey Grammar). The reasons is that, he knows deep inside of him that Andy will grow up one day and forget about him. The dilemma that Woody has, is a good dilemma and makes sense. In a way, foreshadowing Toy Story 3 so rather than being forgotten, he along with his new friends can be loved forever if he takes this chance with the museum in Japan. In the movie we get all the old characters of the first movie, Mr. Potato Head (Don Rickles), Hamm (John Ratzenberger), Rex (Wallace Shawn), and Slinky Dog (Jim Varney in his last movie) as well as new characters such as Bulleye, and Weezy. I don't like how they forced feed us, Weezy. His character really came out of nowhere. Where was he in the original movie? Also check out, the scene was when Woody was being fixed up by the toy repairman, you might notice the toy repairman from the short film, Pixar's Geri's Game. The acting was pretty good, but Joan Cusack can be a bit annoying with her character. The story was well-written. The dramatic and emotional feel of the film has gotten better. The highlight back-story of Jesse just put you into tears, and that whole montage is told by one of the best songs in Disney's history. ""When somebody love me"" sung by Sarah McLachlan. I might not be a huge Randy Newman's fan, but the song works here. The humors works and I like how the film mocks old films and TV Shows like Star Wars and Howdy Dowdy. Pop culture references allow adults to get some jokes that kids might miss, but the kids will have a blast watching this animated adventure. This movie is more plot-oriented than the first--which kids will love and is hence more fun. The visuals are break taking and the action is challenging to the eyes. I actually really liked the ""secret"" villain. I certainly didn't see it coming the first time I saw the movie, and I thought his motivation made sense, and kinda made me feel sorry for him. The fact that he never been loved and played with gave him a very different psychology from the other toys. The museum would be the closest thing to love he felt he'd ever have, so of course he's going to do anything for that, and isn't going to have much sympathy for Woody wanting to return to Andy. This movie isn't for toddlers. Let me get that straight for any first time parent. Its better off, when the child has mature enough aged to the point where it's can be deemed right to watch due to the large noises, large yelling and visual effects that can hurt a toddler's eyes. It's PG rating, people, not G. I really can't find much that was wrong with this film. It's just a great watch. So check it out if you haven't watch it already."
"BB-15","10","5","6","26 November 1999"," Amazingly Good
","It is very rare when an excellent movie is followed by an excellent sequel. Toy Story 2 has done just that. The blending of wonderful animation artistry, terrific writing and great voice overs continues thanks to Pixar. Lots of films claim to be appropriate for all ages and rarely are. I'd recommend this movie to adults with no children! Toy Story 2 is that clever.<br/><br/>
Toy Story 2 has a great time making fun of itself and other movies such as Star Wars and Jurassic Park. The humor is constant and is simply right on. As Toy Story was a buddy picture, Toy Story 2 pokes fun of commando rescue films, as well as computer games and barbies. But as with Toy Story this is a film with a heart highlighting not only the friendship of the original group of toys but adding some interesting new ones too.<br/><br/>Toy Story 2 is an escape into a rich and wonderful fantasy world. It is well worth a visit."

","I liked TOY STORY but didn't love it. It had some wonderful moments (I liked the creepy and destructive kid next door), but it seemed marketed almost exclusively to young boys. In light of this, I was absolutely thrilled when I saw TOY STORY II, as it's a wonderful film for the entire family. For the boys, you have the familiar characters of Woody and Buzz, for the girls you have a new girl toy (Jessie) and for the adult, you have some great characters as well (Stinky Pete and the guy in the chicken costume). Plus, the writing is so amazingly clever and engaging you can't help but love the film. I particularly loved the showdown with Emperor Zurg, Barbie's guest appearance and all the cute little touches as well as homages to toys of yesteryear. And, for once in my jaded career as a reviewer, I have absolutely nothing negative or critical to mention--I enjoyed every minute of this delightful film."

","Despite the baby who screamed in back of me for the entire ""Toy Story 2"" (so much for picking an evening showing to try and avoid that), I adored this follow-up.<br/><br/>The references to ""Star Wars"" are very very funny (though not a single other person in the audience of very young children with their parents got them).<br/><br/>Randy Newman's music is not as good as the original, except for a beautiful ballad sung by Sarah McLaughin. I did expect more from the Riders in the Sky (I'm a big fan of theirs) involvement of cowboy songs, but then none of the audience got the references to boomer TV shows either as the parents in the audience were way younger than me.<br/><br/>Kelsey Grammar was mis-voice cast as the old prospector; he's best as Sideshow Bob on ""The Simpsons;"" I don't know why they didn't pick a wily Western voice instead of snobby Eastern voice. Joan Cusack was a live wire as a cowgirl. Wayne Knight was as terrific a villain like in ""Jurassic Park.""<br/><br/>But the animation was fun and the story quite clever. I figure the theme of playing and loving toys rather than saving them for collectors benefits Disney in the long run, as they encourage people to buy two of each!<br/><br/>The ""outtakes"" at the end are also funny satires.<br/><br/>(originaly written 1/16/2000)"

","Shucks, my original comment for this was deleted. Here is a replacement.<br/><br/>My admiration for Pixar to date is significant, on the order of rat filmmakers that seem to care about ideas in film. There aren't enough of these, so if you find one (here a collective) that not only has intelligent notions of cinema but also make successful movies, you have to celebrate.<br/><br/>Overall, I think this is the weakest of the Pixar films, because it is the least visually adventuresome. What they did instead was explore what I call folding and did so in the written bits, following a pattern where films include the dynamics of other films in some way. ""Blue Velvet"" and ""2001"" are sort of landmark films along these lines, where film types become actual characters. Here the folding is just as radical, perhaps more so because the story overtly mirrors what they are doing.<br/><br/>Here's the setup. Buzz  actually an army of Buzzes  draws his existence from space movies, specifically ""Star Wars."" Woody draws his from cowboy movies (actually TeeVee shows) specifically ""Howdy Doody."" Each prototype ""doll"" gets pulled into his original cosmology. That's the background, what usually serves as the establishing world for a movie. Pixar even uses this in the first shots where other movies work to introduce us to a world.<br/><br/>Within this movie in the movie context is a foreground story: about the value of ""play"" which we are reminded is a re-enacting or borrowing of stories. Its what life is, I think and we are reminded in the script. They'd trade one day of human play (meaning recovered movies) for an eternity in a sterile heaven.<br/><br/>I know that there are many in Hollywood who talk about this sort of story dynamic. There are few that would dare to build a film around it, and very, very few who could do it, make it as visible, overt as it is here, and have audiences be happy for such immersion in reflective dynamics. <br/><br/>Interestingly, the original comment was tossed by IMDb along with a couple hundred others of mine because I failed in a similar enterprise. Someone complained because the original included an observation about religion being recovered narrative and increasingly recovered cinematic narrative. That reader at least did not like such baptism.<br/><br/>Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching."

"DICK STEEL","10","6","9","10 October 2006"," A Nutshell Review: (DVD) Toy Story 2 (1999)
","There are few sequels that can equal or even surpass its original, and for an animated feature, perhaps Toy Story 2 is the first of its kind that didn't end up going direct to video. I'm unsure why I hadn't caught this in the theatres, given that I've thoroughly enjoyed the first Toy Story. I've taken 7 years to finally watch this gem, and of course, to include myself into the legions of Pixar fans out there who have watched every single animated feature they produced.<br/><br/>Toy Story 2 remains the only sequel that Pixar put out, though I'm rooting for The Incredibles to make another appearance on the silver screen. Bringing back its stellar voice cast like Tom Hanks and Tim Allen, and favourite characters that have endeared themselves to us, I'm thrilled that there is so much more story that can be told of our favourite toys in Andy's room.<br/><br/>What worked, at least for me, is that the story and characters appealed to the child inside. I own quite a number of toys as a kid, and yes, I outgrew them, although most of them are still stored in boxes somewhere around the house. Perhaps some of them are small collector's item in their own right, and as a child I did wonder if the toys do come alive to wreck havoc around the room before they retire in time and clean up before I wake up.<br/><br/>Of course toys do not come to life (or do they?) but here in this sequel, the exploration of the friendship theme takes on a different dimension when Woody finds himself with other toys from the same collection as he is - a cowgirl Jessie, his trusty steed Bullseye, and a prospecting character known as Stinky Pete. The dilemma he faces is whether to cast aside his constant fear of Andy abandoning him for good, and opt for life with his new found family in some museum somewhere, where he'll be appreciated for many moons to come, or to return with Buzz and his friends for the life he has grown so accustomed to.<br/><br/>The adaptation to change, loyalty, abandonment, friendship - a lot of themes for a children's movie, but that again is the appeal of Toy Story, that it can be viewed at different levels, for a child who can enjoy the animation and the story at one level, and for adults to reminisce and enjoy it on another. By deftly handling the different themes, and appealing to different segments of audiences with the same movie, Pixar exhibited exactly why they're top dogs in this field.<br/><br/>As always, the music and animation are excellent, and given that I'm watching this now and found it enjoyable, I think they have a film that can stand the test of time. I hear of rumours of a third Toy Story movie, and if that were true, I'd say bring it on!"
"bob the moo","Null","7","11","9 September 2004"," Great plot, great characters and laughs for all ages  not really a bad word to say about it
","In every toy's life there comes a time where damage and fading interest will take its toll. For Woody this comes when a ripped arm sees him left behind on the shelf awaiting repair while Andy goes off to summer camp. When another toy is taken for a yard sale, Woody goes to rescue him only to find himself trapped at the sale and picked up by a collector  who recognises the worth of the rare dolls. The gang set out to rescue Woody but, with his value as a collector's item and his new friends around him, will Woody want to be rescued?<br/><br/>Pixar are going to have a flop sooner or later  either they will misfire or the usual mix of material will start to feel stale. However this has not happened yet and it certainly did not happen with this sequel to their great Toy Story. Keeping similar themes the film delivers a plot that is quite moving at points and has plenty of thought for adults to ponder while the kids laugh at Buzz falling over. In fact this mix of adult material and kiddie material is, as ever, the film's appeal as it does cater so well to both extremes of the market.<br/><br/>The plot is great too and is well supported by great characters in the main who really draw us into the story  considering how often computer effects can just be 'effects' and nothing more, it is to Pixar's credit that so often you just forget these are effects and see them as characters in their own right. The plot gives them plenty to do but their delivery is also spot on  actors can have off days and get their body language wrong, but here the computer characters can be manipulated just how the director wants them to be  this really helps the delivery of the character as body language and movement is a big part of it. The voice work also really helps and, as before, everyone is spot on whether they be just delivering jokes, playing comic bad guys or dealing with more emotional stuff. Hanks is really good, Allen is much better than his TV work and other films would suggest and the support cast is very good  with great turns from new voices such as Knight, Cusack and Grammer but also the regulars of Shawn, Ratzenberger, Varney and Rickles.<br/><br/>The laughs are consistent and great. I'm sure kids love it but for me the adults get the best deal  getting the universal laughs as well as the adult stuff and the loads of movie references. I won't start listing best bits or references but suffice to say that the film gets it right  enough straight laughs and enough general references to make sure the film lasts and is not tied to the period in the way that, say, the Scary Movie films are (by spoofing recent films).<br/><br/>Overall this is a very funny, very enjoyable film that has a great plot, great characters and the cast to back them up. The laughs are good for all ages but the adults will get the majority while the kids miss most of the better stuff. I don't like gushing, so I'd like to counter my praise with some critical observations but, to be honest, I don't really have anything bad to really say about it. A great film to see with the kids."

","""Toy Story 2"" (1999), this took a legendary first movie idea, and made a sequel that's even better. Still to this day, it's nothing short of an iconic film, just like most of the other films made by Pixar Animation Studios! Everything is once again 100% perfect, and fires on all cylinders. The story is more complex, yet more engaging than the first movie. The plot line is very unique and creative, it pulls you in right away and keeps you hooked from beginning to end. The voice acting is stellar from all of the voice actors. The CGI animation holds up to this day, as does the animation in the other Pixar films. Finally, the soundtrack is phenomenal and it truly brings this movie to life. You can play a little part from any part of the music score, and be able to identify what movie it is right away. That just shows you that you have a memorable soundtrack! Pixar, without a shadow of a doubt, makes the best CGI animated films of all-time. ""Toy Story 2"" took the creative premise from the first one and dove even further. There is more character development, more going on and takes a perfect movie and rises it up to 11. I can watch this movie over and over again and never get tired of it. I give this film a full 5 out of 5 star rating, which equates to 10 out of 10 IMDB stars. This movie is perfect for people of all ages. If you haven't seen ""Toy Story 2"" yet, which would surprise me greatly, I mean seriously, who hasn't seen it? Go watch it, I guarantee you'll love it! Just ignore ""Toy Story 3"" (2010) and ""Toy Story 4"" (2019), and pretend that those ""movies"" don't exist."

","Toy Story 2 is, what I think, the best one in the Toy Story franchise and is my favorite of the bunch, simply because there's a lot more to this one than the first Toy Story.<br/><br/>The story is where Andy is leaving for cowboy camp and was supposed to take Woody, but his arm ripped and decides to go on without him. Woody is put on a shelf and comes across an old friend Wheezy, who is an old squeeky penguin toy that lost his squeaker. Wheezy gets taken to a yard sale and Woody tries to rescue him, which he is able to but then a greedy man named Al steals Woody and drives off away. It's now up to Buzz, Slinky, Mr. Potato Head, Rex, and Ham to rescue Woody. Woody also meets new friends and realizes he was apart of a round up gang and is gonna be shipped off to Japan for a toy museum.<br/><br/>The story is very very good. Instead of Woody rescuing Buzz and trying to get back home, this time it is Buzz doing the work. The pacing went very well, and I felt like there was more comedy to this one than the first one. Don't get me wrong, the first one is still a classic, but I like this one a bit more.<br/><br/>The animation improved a lot, and the voice acting is very good. The cast from the first movie comes back and some new members like Joan Cusack, Kelsey Grammar, and Estelle Harris play new characters in this one and they all did a marvelous job.<br/><br/>In conclusion, Toy Story 2 is a phenomenal sequel and still holds up 20 years later."

"Ryan_Barbakins","8","2","2","12 June 2019"," A Perfect Sequel
","Toy Story 2 is a perfect sequel. That doesn't mean it's a perfect movie, but it follows up on the original in a new, exciting, and meaningful way. Not only did The Universe expand in a way that makes sense for the universe and the plot, but also we got backstory on who woody is. This film feels much more alive than it's predecessor. It captures the excitement and morals of the first and multiplied them by 2.
My main reason for liking this more than the 1st, is because of the themes of abandonment in this film. The ""When Somebody Loved Me"" Scene never fails to bring me to tears. You feel for Jesse and even Stinky pete, because the film showed you what they have been going through, and how woody's actions could possibly change their situation. The dilemma Woody has to go through is heartbreaking, because both sides are actually logical and ethical. There were even times where I felt that Pete was doing the right thing.
The animation in this is alright. Obviously 90s CG animation isn't gonna look amazing, but I felt like the design of some of the humans were bad even for its time.
But in the end, This film is touching, and a perfect example on how to follow up on a film."

Also watch for the man in the short film shown before Pixar's last movie, ""A Bug's Life."""
"Spleen","9","4","6","3 December 1999"," Computer animation finally comes of age
","All I can say is, the Hollywood convention for naming sequels is unfortunate.  You don't see so many numerals in literature.  What would have happened if `The Lord of the Rings' had been called `The Hobbit 2'?  No-one would have taken it seriously.  If only someone could have found an alternate name for `Toy Story 2', I wouldn't have such a hard time convincing people that it's the second film that's the real triumph - the delightful masterpiece `Toy Story' was trying to be.<br/><br/>It's funnier; the animation - well, the art direction, anyway - is better, less concerned with ersatz photo-realism; the musical score is immeasurably more stirring; and the songs actually fit.  Most importantly, the rules of the Toy Story universe are clearly described - and adhered to.  It's an ironclad rule that a toy NEVER moves while being observed by a human.  In the original, as you'll recall, one of the main obstacles is overcome by breaking this rule - which trivialises the whole story, since there are a hundred occasions in both movies where it would be useful for the toys to be able to move while being watched.  To see the sequel is to see things done RIGHT.<br/><br/>Furthermore, `Toy Story 2' obeys another golden rule the first film breaks: NEVER deliver a sentimental moral when (a) the sentiment is hard to take seriously, and (b) the success of the story depends upon it being taken seriously.  The original is all about how important toys are to children. In the case of Woody and Buzz, I'm sceptical about this; and in any event, who cares, since it's the toys, not the children, who are the main characters.  The sequel is all about how important children are to toys. That's why the sequel is so much richer.<br/><br/>Yet I feel safe in recommending the film to everyone who loved the first `Toy Story', since I'm sure everything lovable about the first is still there.  Buzz and Woody are much the same (but somehow deeper).  And the three-eyed alien dolls are back - with more screen time!<br/><br/>Maybe it's a mistake to even think about the original, though, because the sequel is magnificent not by comparison, nor by association - it's simply magnificent.  I'll content myself with mentioning just one more thing: the `bloopers' we see over the end credits.  (I gather `A Bug's Life' did the same thing; but since `Toy Story 2' is almost certainly the superior film, this is of no moment.)  A number of live-action movies have adopted the loathesome practise of showing out-takes and discarded footage over the end credits.  It's good to see it so cuttingly satirised."
"kikoydaba3","10","2","3","8 July 2019"," One of those rare sequel that exceeds the original
","Toy Story is already perfect. Toy Story 2 manages to even exceed its predecessor. As is common with Pixar, Toy Story 2 is an excellent film filled with over-the-top comedy, fantastic visuals, score and mature writing. It expands the franchise and adds more characters without feeling stuffed.<br/><br/>While the first film deals with mainly with Buzz and his fall, Toy Story 2 is about Woody and a sudden realization that he is expendable to Andy in the long run. The film also borrows the same premise from the first but is not a mere copy. In Toy Story 2 themes of age and purpose are explored without becoming preachy. When Woody was stolen and taken to a toy collector who plans to sell him, he encounters his past and realizes that he was once a famous toy. Joining him is his round up gang composed of Jessie, Bullseye and Stinky Pete. Convincing Woody that he'll find more meaning and love as a display in a museum, Woody has a crisis of either leaving his owner behind or joining his round up gang. Woody initially denies the offer and this reveals the other character's motives. Jessie was also once owned by someone named Emily but left her when she grew up. Toy Story 2 is a fantastic tale about mortality, even though the toys don't necessarily die, because even toys have to find purpose in life for without purpose life is meaningless. It all culminates in an airport chase scene. Stinky Pete is a menacing villain who can take matters into his own hands. Once again, Stinky Pete is properly written to have real and believable motivations.<br/><br/>The supporting cast are not mere accessories. Buzz's story is continued from the first film with the introduction of Emperor Zurg. Rex is a game junkie who loves playing Buzz's game. His arc concludes simultaneously with Buzz's.<br/><br/>For a film supposed to be sent directly to home release, Toy Story 2, quality wise, is beyond home release. A masterpiece and one of Pixar's finest."

As of 2015, they have had three films and they may be making more (which is a big gamble, but they are three for three thus far). Some people have argued that this film is better than the first film. They may be right. It is at least as good.<br/><br/>The added ""villain"" of the toy collector (Wayne Knight) was a great idea, and gives Woody a back story that was missing. Was it necessary?

Along with the behind the scenes of this movie, I can't imagine how stressed they were with it by redoing the entire story in under nine months before the due date, making the animation better than the first movie, and almost losing the entire file and yet one computer saved everything. I mean, wow, that takes a lot of blood and sweat just to make this movie possible.<br/><br/>The movie is better than the first one, it has more action, more characters to love, and they even made Jessie's backstory really emotional. There's one scene that still amazes me to this day and that's when Woody's eye gets clean, you can see the dust getting wiped out and all sparkly again, too this day I still have no idea how they made that happen and yet it was the late 1990s, that one of the moments that shows how great Pixar can really be.<br/><br/>This is under my top 5 favorite Pixar films ever, and it shows why.

","This movie, without question, fails to live up to the purity of the original. Right down to the callbacks and the often slack narrative, TOY STORY 2 only further highlights the truly unique experience of the first one. One of the few crazy ideas that alchemized into something thoughtful, character-driven, and thrilling, there's no way it could be replicated. I mean, just look how A BUGS LIFE turned out.<br/><br/>But with all the baggage held against the sequel, it's also without question it's the most ambitious. Thoroughly expanding its story to deeper, more existential questions, it's the rare sequel that earns its EMPIRE STRIKES BACK level praise. It's finally a movie that questions what truly makes for a great life for a toy: standing behind glass walls and loved by everybody forever, or live with a finite relationship with a child destined to grow out of you soon.<br/><br/>Buzz gets the backseat this time around, centering the story on Woodys turmoil while his space friend endure some hijinks to rescue him. People might say his side story is the sole weak point but I'd argue it's necessary for the story; it's a lot of heavy themes at play, so the gang deliver just the right amount of humor to level the tone.<br/><br/>By now, everybody knows the Prospector turns out to be a last minute bad guy at the end. My take on this is how seamless of an antagonist he is; the idea that all toys are destined to be thrown out looms heavy on these characters. So much so that any of these characters can snap to immoral tendencies at any minute. This is why Kelsey Grammer delivers a phenomenal performance here. He's comforting as the Prospector but you can clearly hear the history behind it all. You can hear the desperation of his character, let alone Jesse and Bullseye too, and the film slowly builds that desperation into villainy that seems tangible.<br/><br/>As for Jesse, let's just say there's a particular moment with her that personally spoke to me. Not gonna say which though, seems like an easy answer.<br/><br/>Again what can I say; TOY STORY 2 is a grand achievement that could've done much less."

It once again uses its very classic storytelling structure to great effect, picking up where its predecessor left off in a natural and almost necessary way. The voice cast continue to excel and the new additions are perhaps some of the franchise's most iconic characters, too. Plus, the humour gets just referential enough for it to be appealing as opposed to pandering. There's not much more to say: it's entertaining, heartfelt and surprisingly funny.

Although a bit more repetitive and fan-serving than boundary-pushing, the film's ingenuity, commitment to its characters and emotional themes made it a loveable continuation of the groundbreaking work of the original.<br/><br/>The story sees Andy going away to cowboy camp, during which his mom holds a yard sale. Woody, during a valiant attempt to save an old toy penguin named Wheezy (Joe Ranft), is unexpectedly stolen by a greasy toy collector (Wayne Knight), forcing a rescue team comprising Buzz, Hamm (John Ratzenberger), Rex (Wallace Shawn), Slinky (Jim Varney) and Potato Head (Don Rickles) to find and save him.<br/><br/>With Andy swept aside, most of the action takes place out in the world, widening the scope of ""Toy Story"" and creating exciting new scenarios for the characters. By the same token, it loses a little bit of the realism that made the initial concept special. Toys sneaking across major city roads hiding under traffic cones is closer to slapstick than wonder-inducing. In the first film, when Woody and Buzz sneak about Pizza Planet in fast food containers, the same idea is in place, it just feels more high stakes and believable than in this movie, which blows the lid off the toy chest.<br/><br/>Getting a little overly imaginative is a small knock on a film that nurtures a deeper love of its characters and furthers their story. Woody discovering his origins and meeting other characters in cowgirl Jessie (Joan Cusack), horse Bullseye and Stinky Pete the prospector (Kelsey Grammar) introduces the concept of collector's items into the ""Toy Story"" universe, while Buzz, free of existential crisis, finds the tables have turned from where he was opposite Woody in the last movie. The story aims to enrich its original themes with new notions that speak to the purpose of toys in our lives.<br/><br/>The film's most poignant moment comes accompanied by - yet again - a beautiful Randy Newman song performed by Sarah McLachlan, which reveals an obvious truth to the audience but one that's painful for toys: abandonment. The song puts the larger story into perspective, in addition to making you cry and feel guilty for any toy you ever moved on from.<br/><br/>Preposterous as it gets, Pixar's crew has a ton of fun with ""Toy Story 2"" and it shows. Having fun while keeping characters at the center and employing genuine themes that go deeper than kid-friendly morals, they strike gold yet again for all ages.<br/><br/>~Steven C<br/><br/>Thanks for reading!

","Toy Story 2 brings as back to Andy's toy chest and all those quirky little toys that inhabit it. By now Buzz Lightyear has become an accepted and valued member of the extended family and a lifelong friend to Woody. But once again the peace and quiet of the toys is disturbed, this time by Woody being kidnapped by a toy collector.<br/><br/>Toy Story 2 hits primarily the same points its predecessor did. The fear of being abandoned, the fear of loosing one's friends, the fear of change. In a nutshell, the fear of growing up, told through the medium of sentient toys. But the story is different enough that, even though the basic message is the same, it feels like a continuation of a story rather than a repeat.<br/><br/>It helps that the characters have grown. Woody and Buzz especially. Sure they still have their individual personalities, but I like that they have become such good friends. The new characters are also a lot of fun and have a great backstory connected to them. I could watch a whole movie just about them.<br/><br/>But yeah, it is very similar to the original and there is something to be said about novelty. This is a very good movie, especially for children, but it is not the original. You're going to love seeing all your beloved characters come to life once again, but you're probably not going to learn anything you didn't learn in the first film.<br/><br/>Does this mean it's not worth a watch? By heavens, no!"

","You have to admire it don't you?  Toy Story 2 has all the delights of TS, but with added technology.

","I enjoyed Toy Story 2 more than the first installment.  I agree that the animation is greatly improved (quite amazing) and the new voice actors do well.  This movie is entertaining for both children and adults."
"tallguy62","5","6","15","22 September 2008"," Joan Cusack has an annoying voice!!!
","OK, am I the only one who thinks that Joan Cusack is one of the biggest casting mistakes in all of animated movie history? Her voice is screechy, whining, grating and unconvincing as a cartoon character. Why the studios thought she would be good as a ""voice"" mystifies me. She spoiled this movie the first time I ever saw it because her range as a ""cartoon voice"" is non-existent. Even Tom Hanks' voice in this sequel is sometimes annoying and grating, but Cusack as a cartoon character just does not work! Cusack is fine as a leading lady when she is not playing in a cartoon.<br/><br/>Annie Potts was perfectly cast. My favorite continues to be Wallace Shawn -- nobody compares to his voice talents. As in the first film, Mt. Shawn outshines everyone else as one of the most endearing characters in all of animation history. For some reason, Rex always has the best lines in this film.<br/><br/>One of my favorite parts is when the toys cross the busy street using orange pylon cones. That was very clever, if someone contrived.<br/><br/>Overall, a good movie, but not one of the best for the reasons stated above."
"moonspinner55","5","5","12","20 July 2007"," Begins with great fanfare, but it can't sustain that level of excitement
","DisneyPixar's sequel to 1995's ""Toy Story"" is over-inflated with fun. Though it smoothly introduces several fine new characters and has colorful voice-over work and energy to spare, the plot this time (taking some of the toys out of the bedroom and into the big cruel world) doesn't sustain much interest. Woody gets snatched at a yard sale by a toy collector and learns he's a high-priced rarity in the antique market; Buzz, Slinky Dog, Rex and Mr. Potato Head come to the rescue. Best moment is the funny sci-fi opening (which manages to be satirical and exciting), and Woody's introduction to his heretofore unknown history is wonderfully presented. The big rescue, while lively for younger viewers, is lengthy and full of manic action; there's so much bombast (and hollering from the stars) that the intricate details and warm nostalgia which earmarked the first ""Toy Story"" slowly slips away. ** from ****"
"LDB_Movies","4","7","19","30 December 1999"," I must be from another planet...
","but I hated this movie.  I don't really see what everyone is gushing about. I liked the first one, but this one adds NOTHING to the theme. I saw no reason for the filmmakers to produce a sequel (other than to make money) and this film has no purpose or point.  Yes, the animation is outstanding, but so was the animation in the first one.  The only good point was the ""music video"" sequence of the cowgirl's past performed to a beautiful Sarah McLauchlin song.  Otherwise, I didn't laugh out loud once.  I was bored silly.  I rated this movie a 4 out of 10... my lowest rating ever on IMDb. In fact, the only movie I've seen ever that I rate lower is ""Beautiful Mystery"" (don't ask).<br/><br/>TAKE MY ADVICE-- DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS OVERRATED AND MEANINGLESS SEQUEL!"
"Palam","5","3","6","21 January 2000"," Overrated
","I really don't understand the hype over this film. Top 25 of all time? Definitely not! The storyline is only average although it it slightly better than the original toy story but not by much.<br/><br/>The animation is great as others have mentioned but that in itself does not make a great movie... I've seen saturday morning cartoons with equally impressive animation.<br/><br/>There are a few funny scenes but the movie's plot is much too shallow for adult. It is a great simple film for kids to enjoy but I was very bored throughout most of the movie. The most enjoyable part of the movie is the nostalgic pleasure gained from watching toys that I used to play with as a kid come to life.<br/><br/>I give it a very average 5 stars. Again good for kids, boring for adults."
"phantom8","5","4","10","12 May 2000"," Yet more Disney formula
","I don't know why critics liked this movie so much. If you've seen Toy Story, Tarzan, A Bug's Life or any other Disney movie, you've seen them all already. What more is there to say? We get the usual hero experiences crisis, hero undergoes a touching journey in which he makes crucial life choices, hero makes the choice that the audience wants him to make, and we get the ""Awwww, a happy ending"" kind of ending. Of course, since this is Disney, we have to throw in all the comic sidekicks.<br/><br/>If you're stuck seeing a kid's movie, I would recommend Stuart Little instead -- at least it has a different concept with a computer animated mouse interacting with live humans, and the computer animation is miles better than Toy Story 2's rather dated animation."
"VG2000","6","6","18","11 April 2001"," Overrated
","When i saw this movie i was bored as hell, partly because i was forced to watch it. This movie is highly overrated. It's like a spoof to star wars but then spaceballs was better. The jokes are not that funny, and the story line is not that good either, even my 9 year old brother was bored, i am usually a fan of serious movies, but i often like movies like Chicken Run, now thats a movie. This movie was nothing much than a bunch of stolen ideas, with stupid unfunny characters which ruined it for me. Trust me this one is not worth it. 6/10 just because of Tom Hanks."

","Of all the movies in existence this one is good?  C'mon, it was Disney crap. I now have no faith in my fellow IMDB users.  This movie was a ""money maker"" nothing else.  Toy Story was ok due to the computer art.  But this was just there to make money.  Shame on you Tom Hanks."
"ThomasDrufke","9","2","4","22 June 2019"," ""Ride Like the Wind, Bullseye!""
","Of the original trilogy, Toy Story 2 has always been my least re-watched and least favorite, but that's not to say the film isn't a near all-around success. It's the film that really started to introduce the idea of mortality to the toy's shelf life. Woody is kidnapped by a toy collector and meets Jessie, Bullseye, and The Prospector, toys who just want to make it to Japan to be on display for the rest of their life. Jessie's backstory is among the best sequences Pixar has ever put to screen, the Woody's Round-Up scenes are magical, and the animation is far more detailed and intricate than the first. It's also much better on re-watch than I remember.<br/><br/>9.5/10"
"etodell97","5","2","4","20 May 2013"," Rotten Tomatoes
","So, I would like to think of this review not much as a review on the movie, but rather on the critique that I saw this movie receiving on Rotten Tomatoes. So, I was looking through the is it of top movies on that site and noticed how Toy Story 2 has become the highest rated movie on the site, which really got under my skin. I'm not usually one to be critical of other peoples opinions, but after watching my fair share of films, not in a million years would I put Toy Story 2 as my number one movie. I understand that it is difficult to compare Toy Story to most other movies due to the significant difference of the graphics, but (in my opinion) there are so many movies that are better than this movie. I do not understand how a group of critics who make their living off of analyzing movies have concluded that the movie deserves 100% on the ratings. In 1993, one of the most heart touching movies ever (Schindler's List) was released. This movie was surpassed no only by this excuse of a high rated movie, but also by ""The Social Network"". The next year in film produced a dynasty of films which included (Pulp Fiction, The Shawshank Redemption, and Forrest Gump). Ultimately, Forrest Gump snatched the Oscar for best picture, but proceeded to only receive a 75% (ish) rating from the critics, as opposed to Toy Story 2 which was nominated for ONE Oscar (a soundtrack related award), which it didn't even win. So I have started to question what critics qualify as a good movie, because not in a million years would I (and most other sane people) compare the artistic depictions in Toy Story 2, to The Shawshank Redemption, or Goodfellas, or Fight Club for that matter. I am giving this review 5 stars not to trash the movie, but rather because five is the median of the possible ratings I could give. (Just to clarify now). It's past midnight in my room right, 85 degrees in my room, laptop on my lap, overheating. I'm sweating horribly due to the heat, but yet I continue my rant because I'm frustrated. I am frustrated because after watching my fair share of A-list movies, I wouldn't even put Toy Story 2 in my top 100 (and based on the rating the movie has on here, I can safely assume that most other people agree with me on this site). I guess I will end my rant by stating that Rotten Tomatoes has annoyed me. I have always been loyal to this site, and rarely gone onto that excuse of a Movie Review site."

","Toy story 2 is almost as awesome as the first one and only reason i didnt give it 10 stars is becase some tiny part in middle of film was dragging a small bit,but everything else is awesome and in some ways it was able to surpass some staff from original,obvious answer is animation cause its cleaner and more pretty to look at,but story was also great and it holds its spot back to back with 1995 version,buzz and woody were great again and their chemistry was even higher and it had some heartfelt moments mixed with some new characters what were as much as awesome like old crew,toy story 2 is great sequel to a brilliant franchise"

","I thought the original Toy Story was great. I went to this movie hardly knowing anything about it. Toy Story 2 exceeded my expectations; it's better than the original Toy Story. This movie works on two levels. It's aimed at younger kids, who will love the wackiness of the characters and the situations they find themselves in, though some of the jokes might sail over their heads (but they'll laugh anyway). It's also aimed at adults, who, when I saw it, laughed louder than the kids at some points. The voice work is excellent, especially Tom Hanks and Tim Allen, reprising their roles from the original. The supporting toys (Mr. Potato Head, Slinky Dog, et al.) have much bigger roles this time around.<br/><br/>This movie has everything: Andy's new dog Buster; two dueling Buzz Lightyears; partying Barbie dolls; three 3-eyed aliens from the original; even the Evil Emperor Zurg! I can't emphasize enough how great this movie is and I highly recommend it for kids and adults."

"oneofthesilence","9","0","0","19 April 2020"," My least favourite TS, but still... look at the score
","So first of all the animation has vastly improved. It's nolonger distracting like the first movie kinda was.<br/><br/>But other than that this movie is a very slight step down from the first one in my opinion. But another thing that I think is slightly better than TS1 is the plot; it's a bit more of a complex plot than the original's which I appreciate. I mean the more I think about it, this movie is pretty much on par with the original and even better in a few ways, but I do have a reason for liking it less than the original which I will get to later. The characters, new and old are great here too. The main 2, Woody & Buzz, are given chances to develop further, the side characters are still great and funny too, and one of the new characters, named Jessie, is a great addition and has a great backstory. However I found the twist villain, Stinky Pete, to be boring, He's essentially an inferior version of Lotso who would come later.<br/><br/>So yah, this movie is largely an improvement, however my biggest problem, and my hinderance to liking this more than the original is the 3rd act. The first 2 acts are incredibly engaging and fun, and if the 3rd act was that good I would definitely like this more than the original. However I feel that the 3rd act looses momentum, is less fun & interesting, is predictable, and in a way almost feels unnecessary. I mean obviously you have to have a conclusion, but I feel it could have done a lot better. The 3rd act is still ""good"", it wraps up the movie as well as it needs to, but it's just not as good as the rest of the movie. Also that random song at the end was just dumb, sorry.<br/><br/>But overall I still really enjoy this movie. Just not as much as the original. It's a 90%"

","I have always considered Toy Story 2 to be the weakest film in the original trilogy and my opinion hasn't changed after rewatching it, but it's still a great film and some of my favourite moments out of all the films come from this one.<br/><br/>Just like in the original film, Toy Story 2 contains some profound messages, this time surrounding jealousy and anxiety, which will go straight over children's heads. They managed to pull this off while also remaining a film which is thoroughly entertaining for everyone.<br/><br/>When people talk about the best scenes from any Pixar film, they often mention the first ten minutes from Up or the furnace scene in Toy Story 3, but the scene in Toy Story 2 where we learn about Jessie's emotional back-story with Emily is completely underrated and one of the best.<br/><br/>Despite only being released four years apart, the animation seemed a lot better in this film than it was in the original. The visuals were never bad in Toy Story, but it does seem a little more dated than the sequel for today's standards.<br/><br/>The last twenty minutes are a complete blast, and would be my favourite twenty minutes from any Toy Story film if it wasn't for the infamously emotional ending in Toy Story 3.<br/><br/>Overall, there are so many elements which I completely love in Toy Story 2, and it's a worthy follow-up to the 1995 break-out hit.

","Toy Story 2 is once again directed by John Lasseter alongside with Ash Brannon and Lee Unkrich. Screenplay by Andrew Stanton, Rita Hsiao, Doug Chamberlin and Chris Webb.
Starring all the original cast alongside with Joan Cusack, Kelsey Grammer and Wayne Knight.<br/><br/>The movie takes a place after the landmark 1995 computer-animated blockbuster, but this time Woody is stolen by a toy collector, Buzz and his friends set out on a rescue mission to save Woody before he becomes a museum toy property with his roundup gang Jessie, Prospector, and Bullseye.<br/><br/>I loved the first TS movie, I think it's one of the best animated movies of all time, though I didn't give it an A+, but grade is not everything. Anyways TS2 is a very rare sequel that took the success of its predecessor and added something on it, yeah, it has the same pattern of the first one, a toy is lost and the others are looking for them, but as I said, they added something on it, and it definitely worked!<br/><br/>TS2 is my least favorite of the franchise, though I think it's an amazing sequel to an amazing movie, and there are many reasons why this movie is so good, let's see:<br/><br/>As I said the movie was like the first one a little bit, the concept itself, but it added something more, every toy from the first one here was involved at the searching for Woody, they weren't just watching from the window. And they took their screentime, and they were hilarious. The movie has some very cool Easter Eggs, some are easy to notice and some aren't, but still hilarious.<br/><br/>The movie also has a more of a plot, not like its predecessor, only a couple of toys trying to find their way home, no! This time a character has a back story, that effects the whole movie, and adds more depth to it!<br/><br/>It also has an amazing animation, which is still, to this very day, timeless! IF you didn't like the animation in the first one, or you think it wasn't that great, you will definitely like this one! The movie also has a very sense of humor, but the first one was funnier to me. The characters are so charming once more, and there are some new characters, some don't have that much of screentime, but some has a lot.
Woody and Buzz once more are the best part of this movie, their friendship inspired me as a kid, and it keeps inspiring me til now! And that's a great thing about this movie, it works, once again, for kids and adults.<br/><br/>The casting choices are once more, brilliant, all of them were so much alive, you never feel like they are just cartoon characters, the actors added so much live and depth to their characters!<br/><br/>The plot is so good, the first one was simple, but this one is a little bit deeper and with more storytelling, but still not perfect, some scenes didn't make sense. I know, it's a movie about talking toys, there's one scene in particular that didn't make sense at all, spoilers ahead, if you haven't watched TS2!<br/><br/>Alright, the scene when Woody was trying to get his arm from Al, the Prospector turned on the TV and put the remote under Jessie's box, and she didn't notice AT ALL!<br/><br/>Back to business, another flaw bugged me a little, is the Prospector's character, he didn't have any motivation to do what he did, I mean he hates humans and he doesn't want to me played with, he didn't get abandoned by someone before, he only saw Jessie and heard her story, and that's really it, I know he doesn't want to get abandoned, but it wasn't enough for me.<br/><br/>There are my only issues with this movie, otherwise that was great movie, and some said it improved on the first one, for me.. no, but I understand why do they think that.<br/><br/>Toy Story 2 is once again impressive and charming, with amazing animation and good sense of humor, and an entertaining adventure for all ages! I'm gonna give Toy Story 2 an A! If you haven't seen this one, go check it out, it definitely worth your time.<br/><br/>Thank you guys, for reading another review of mine, if you liked this, click on my name up above and see all my reviews, look forward to my review of Toy Story 3.

"sol-","Null","0","0","24 February 2017"," Falling with Style Part 2
","When Woody is stolen by an avid toy collector, the other toys in Andy's room hatch a plan to rescue him in this ambitious sequel that takes the toys out of their comfort zone, exposing them to the world at large. Their interactions on the outside are certainly quite funny, causing road accidents and chaos by driving toy cars through a toy store, however, the best aspect of the film is how it furthers the personal identity themes of the first film. Both Woody and Buzz are provided with detailed back stories for their design and Woody has to wrestle with whether to join the toys from the set that he originally came from while Buzz finds himself up against another of him who likewise believes that he is a real spaceman and not a toy. Often cited as the weakest of the first three 'Toy Story' movies, 'Toy Story 2' is certainly a little too sentimental for its own good (Jessie's flashback drags on for too long) and not all the jokes work, but it remains fairly engaging to view, even with the novelty aspect of the first movie not the same. The toy characters are simply fun and interesting to follow around, often displaying surprising ingenuity while on their rescue mission. The film additionally touches on some interesting issues not covered in the first movie, such as the vulnerability of toys when being played with and the sense of loss when owners grow up and move on. No, the magic might not quite be the same here as in the ""falling with style"" original, but it is great to come across a sequel that at least tries to take the material in a different direction."

"Mr. Movies","Null","0","0","4 December 1999"," One of the few animated movies I've seen that possesses every emotion
","There are very few movie sequels out there that have lived up to their originals. Even fewer for animated, computer generated movies. Hardly ever do sequels exceed the original's excellence. Although, about an hour ago I found an exception: Toy Story 2.<br/><br/>This movie is very similar to its predecessor, TOY STORY, also starring the Hanks/Allen duo of Buzz Lightyear and Woody. It has the same theme, same message, but a different storyline and fresh, original ideas. Many times do things seem perfect when something wrong goes on yet the movie never grows repetitive, tiresome nor dragged out. Every ounce of film has enough fresh, innovative ideas in it to keep a smile on your face and keep you emotionally involved throughout the film's entirety.<br/><br/>This is one of the few animated movies I've seen that possesses every emotion. Plenty of humor, even a few moving scenes and a dash of romance. As hard as I tried, I couldn't find anything wrong that stands out with this film.<br/><br/>Andy, the owner of Woody, Buzz Lightyear and all the other toys, goes off to a cowboy camp and while he is gone, Woody (voice of Tom Hanks) is stolen by Al McWiggin (voice of Wayne Knight), an avid toy collector in hopes to sell Woody and his ""Roundup Gang"" to a museum for a lot of money. Woody finds out he was once a member of this ""Roundup Gang,"" a TV show consisting of himself, Jessie (voice of Joan Cusack), Stinky Pete the Prospector (Kelsey Grammar) and Bulls-eye, the horse. Buzz Lightyear (voice of Tim Allen), Mr. Potato Head (voice of Don Rickles), Slinky Dog (voice of Jim Varney) and Rex (voice of Wallace Shawn) go out in search for their old pal Woody. They go through much misadventure and toil on their way.<br/><br/>This is an excellent movie for people of all ages, and that is a fact. Kids from 5 to 65 in the audience were laughing and enjoying the movie just as much as I was. If you are looking for a great entertainment, a good laugh and a fun ride, TOY STORY 2 is the movie to see. Perfect? No. Flawless? No. Excellent? Very. Its quite worth the money. There are quite a few surprises which I have not mentioned such as references to STAR WARS, JURASSIC PARK, 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY, and an appearance of the character in GERI'S GAME, the short film in 1997 (shown before the Pixar Animation and Disney Studios' A BUG'S LIFE).<br/><br/>Go see TOY STORY 2. Bring your kids, bring your friends, your whole family. I guarantee you'll enjoy it. If you don't laugh or even crack a smile, I suggest to you psychological help. Its a very fun movie. ***** out of *****"

","Toy Story 2... The name is now well-known throughout Thanksgiving because it's so darn great.  IT's a wonderful movie packing in the light-hearted humor in the original with new ones.  Pixar outdid itself with this monumental movie. Woody and Buzz are still the very best characters.  It was good to see the Buzz Lightyear who doesn't know he's a toy back.  Then there's many new things to boot up.  It's so intricately plot-driven and also particularly fascinating.  One thing though, I miss Randy Newman's music score like those three songs in the original.  But nonetheless this IS the movie of 99' not Star Wars, not Austin Powers, THIS!

","What is the typical stereotype on film sequels?  They're bigger and supposedly better, right?  But the truth of the matter is that they are mostly never on par with the original.  That certainly isn't the case here. Toy Story 2 is absolutely everything you want to see in a sequel and more. You have the return of everyone's favorite characters, Woody & Buzz along with very memorable side characters (Hamm, Mr. Potatohead, Rex, Slinky Dog) with an addition of a few new memorable characters, in a very fun and smart action comedy for all ages. What makes this film work so well is that the audience isn't second guessed for a second and none of this film is dumbed down for the kids, which is probably why the adults were laughing four times harder than the young ones. The first Toy Story was outstanding enough, but to have a sequel be even more entertaining is always a pleasant surprise.  Pixar has done it again, and I was amazed by every frame of it."

","I went to see this show at the local dollar theater last night with my girlfriend, and actually (for once) ended up watching the movie instead of her.<br/><br/>Surprised? You bet I am. This is a first.<br/><br/>Back in 1995, Pixar's original masterpiece, ""Toy Story,"" captivated audiences with its magic, attacking the angle of toys being alive. This perspective, however, shows more -- much, MUCH more -- than just toys singing and dancing. It shows that they have feelings, not that they are just some mindless bits of plastic and cloth. (""Puppetmaster"" ring any bells?)<br/><br/>The sequel, however, takes things a step further. In the opening, Pixar and John Lasseter prove one thing: Animation and creativity know no bounds. From the amazing opening scene to the epi-climax under the plane, this show carries through, and is just as good as the original. It's not necessarily a sequel; it's more of another adventure with Woody and his pals, which is what made it interesting for me: I don't like having to think about what happened in the previous movie(s) unless I have to.<br/><br/>In short, if you liked ""Toy Story,"" you'll LOVE the sequel.

"JimPills","Null","0","0","26 November 1999"," Amusing But Not Amazing
","Overall, ""Toy Story 2"" was a very entertaining experience.  Led by director John Lasseter, the animation team at Pixar has always been able to whip up some truly impressive eye candy, and they do not disappoint here.  The film has a lot of cleverness and some true moments of inspiration, such as Woody's discovery of his past through an old kinescope of his TV show, and Buzz's battling of another Buzz Lightyear doll seized by the same delusions he himself suffered in the first film.  The voice work is also top-notch, especially the wonderful Wallace Shawn as timid tyrannosaur Rex, and the new characters are engaging and fun.<br/><br/>However, the narrative lacks either the sly cleverness or the direct emotional pull of the first film, and the nasty toy salesman Al (voiced by the somewhat grating Wayne Knight) never reaches the gonzo heights of ""Toy Story""'s toy-torturing Sid.  Too many of the best gags were lifted from the first film, and too much of the story seemed to be a replay of events from the original ""Toy Story"", just with Woody in Buzz's place.<br/><br/>Still, I was once again impressed with Lasseter's ability to make us see the child-toy relationship from a toy's perspective, and the idea that toys know that their time with children is numbered is a poignant one.  ""Toy Story 2"" is not the exuberant classic its predecessor was, but it's a sweet and entertaining little film, and I think children will really love it."
"Buddy-51","Null","0","0","26 November 1999"," wonderful sequel
","""Toy Story 2,"" the superb sequel to the groundbreaking 1995 ""animated"" hit, is simply bursting with imagination, humor, and enough technical wizardry and high spirited energy for a dozen such films.  Rare indeed is the sequel that outshines the original, but, in the case of this series, the second time around turns out to be just that exception.<br/><br/>All the beloved original characters have made a return appearance as the film bursts the bounds of the bedroom and the neighborhood and moves out into the big wide world of crowded city streets, highrise apartment buildings and airport runways.  In this installment, Woody is ""kidnapped"" by an opportunistic toy salesman who is bent on selling him and three other ""western"" figures to a Japanese museum.  (It turns out Woody was once the centerpiece of his own marionette show on 1950's television - a clever and witty takeoff on that long lost genre).  The frenetic plot involves Woody's friends' desperate attempts to recover their old buddy and bring him safely back to themselves and the boy who loves him.<br/><br/>What is most remarkable about this film is that each toy is differentiated so beautifully, given a distinctive personality that makes every one of them appear very lifelike.  Even more impressive is that, while each conveys a goodnatured sweetness that makes them palatable to children, most of them also contain that subtle touch of cynicism that makes them appealing to adults as well.  This is portrayed most humorously in the witty juxtaposition between the Buzz Lightyear who is conscious of his status as a toy and a newly-opened ""deluded"" Buzz who sincerely believes he is a genuine action hero on a mission and whose exaggerated heroic mannerisms generate many of the belly laughs in the film.<br/><br/>The film also achieves a depth of thought rarely achieved in animated features.  Woody, for instance, is confronted with a moral dilemma of either leaving his old time friends, who have braved any number of dangers to come and rescue him, or abandoning the new friends he has made who are counting on him to save them from obscurity by becoming a member of the museum entourage.  In addition, the film actually confronts the issue of toy mortality, as Woody must face up to the fact that his owner will soon grow out of his love for his playthings and that he and the other toys will one day be consigned to the inevitable trash heap that sadly awaits them all.<br/><br/>Still, the main delight of this film is the incredibly high level of energy it manages to sustain during its near-90 minute running time.  The inventivness and humor never flag as the eye feasts on the brilliant technical accomplishments of each aspect of the film.  This is indeed animation of the very highest order and the speed with which it zooms by, with delight upon delight spilling off the screen, makes ""Toy Story 2"" one of the very best of the genre.  This is one fantastically fun movie!"

","I saw this with a 4 year old and her mother.  The movie has some scenes that are understandably scary for that age (fights between Darth Vader & Buzz LightYear that echo the Star War's scene betweeb DV & Obi Wan Kenobi).  Kids who like lots of action, bangs, and surprises will like it.  The age range roughly 6 to 10 years is probably most suitable in general.  The movie has many references to things only adults would catch so it makes a successful attempt to keep big people entertained.  It's OK but personally, I preferred ""Elmo in Grouchland"" for plot and message."

","I am 45 years old, single, never married, and have no children.  However, that didn't stop me from seeing and enjoying ""Toy Story 2"" this past weekend.<br/><br/>There is very little I can add to the comments already posted.  CG animation works well for the toys and other non-living items, and even in the short time since the original ""Toy Story"" the improvement in the animation of ""real"" creatures (compare Sid's dog and the people in ""TS"" to Andy's dog and the people in ""TS2"") is impressive, but there is still room for improvement.<br/><br/>My favorite scene was when Jesse first meets Woody, and I danged near spit rootbeer through my nose when I saw the ""Cleaner"" character!  Pixar's ""Jumping Lamp"" short that preceded the actual feature was a nice touch, as were the outtakes, although the flatulence humor was a little too ""South Park"" for my taste.  One has to wonder if this would have passed muster if Walt Disney were still alive.<br/><br/>There are a couple of odd points that are never really answered, though. It turns out that Woody is a highly-prized cowboy doll inspired by a puppet character from an early B&W TV show (did anybody else make the connection to ""Howdy Doody""?), which raised (to me, anyway) the questions of how Andy came to own one -- and in such good condition, yet! --  and how come Andy's parents weren't aware of Woody's collectible value?<br/><br/>And maybe I'm reading too much into this, but I personally feel that ""TS2"" also took a couple of well-aimed and well-deserved shots at the current ""collectibles"" trend.  It tries and succeeds in making the point that toys are for kids and are meant to be played with, rather than purchased by adults and held as marketable commodities not unlike stocks and bonds (can you say ""Beanie Babies""?).<br/><br/>It's poorly-conceived movies like ""Inspector Gadget"" and ""George of the Jungle"", or obvious movie-length commercials like ""Pokemon"" and ""Ninja Turtles"" that show us what is wrong with children's cinema today.  We need more movies like ""Toy Story"" and ""Toy Story 2"" to show us what it can and should be."

","I have just been on holiday in Singapore I had seen the new James Bond Movie(incidently quite good). The next day I found out Toy Story 2 was being released I booked the tickets and off I went YIPPPEEE!! The story was simple but effective, with the basics being that Woody is kidnapped by a toy collector wanting to pocket the money for a full set of dolls from the hit cowboy t.v programme. The set was not complete without Woody. He is kidnapped and at first wants to escape but when Buzz and Co. try to rescue him he decides he would be better off in a museum with the T.V buddys he had forgot about. Not discouraged buzz and friends try to persuade him not too and finally he comes round, but is it too late!!!<br/><br/>The film was very enjoyable, with much more adult humour and clever wit included. Connections to films such as Star wars were hilarious! My favourite part being the Barbie aisle of the toy store and tour guide Barbie. There are many great moments in the film and if you don't enjoy this film I would like to know because you obviously need help!

","John Lasseter directed the original Toy Story as well as the entertaining A Bug's Life. Toy Story 2 is the best of a very good bunch!<br/><br/> These animated films are definitely not just for children. Even if you're never too old to be immature, Toy Story 2 travels well in adult company. It's full of universal themes. We all after all fear rejection.<br/><br/> Woody is a cowboy doll who's arm gets damaged and then there's disaster - his young master Andy doesn't take him to the annual cowboy camp!<br/><br/> Heartbroken Woody has to face some very difficult home truths. Apart from the fact that he's only ever been played with when Andy felt like it, it's inescapable that Andy will eventually grow up and discard him. He'll be chucked into the bin, thrown away. And he really loves Andy.<br/><br/> Or he'll be sold off in a garage sale.<br/><br/> This fate awaits all of Andy's toys, and one of them does get put onto the driveway to be sold. Woody goes to the rescue and so begins the main part of the Toy Story 2 adventure.<br/><br/> There's also the piquancy of the moments when the toys hear a human coming when they've been getting about on their toy business.<br/><br/>They have to scramble to get back into their previous positions so they're not caught out, often flinging themselves into an ungainly heap, looking half broken in a pile.<br/><br/> You're meant to feel sorry for these sweet, uncomplicated beings, and it works. If our toys were really alive as we imagined them to be, how would they feel when we dump them?<br/><br/>Remember that teddy bear you kept for years as a treasured friend? Where's Teddy now?<br/><br/> But all this adds to nothing unless we are treated to superb film making. The best intentions of artists often amount to absolutely nothing, or more often, the mediocre.<br/><br/> In fact the film craft of Lasseter's film crew is getting even better. The original Toy Story didn't really hit the mark, it waned a fair bit after the first hour. But this one keeps its power until its conclusion.  Good films require all of their elements to fire.<br/><br/> The voicings are terrific, particularly from Tom Hanks as Woody, but a film with a script as vibrant as this one must be a dream for actors.<br/><br/> Animation has come a long way as well. Toy Story 1 was remarkable because of its totally digital environment. Never before had the backgrounds been completely computer drawn and they looked great. However the film lacked enough complex (adult) ideas to maintain interest until the end.<br/><br/>But bells and whistles do not a good film make. In fact in Toy Story 2 the filming process, this wonderful computer wizardry, almost always recedes to be unnoticed, and that's utterly remarkable.<br/><br/>But when it's most important, the digital magic in Toy Story 2 is becomes vibrant. This is when the subtleties of expression on the faces of Woody and his toy mates just couldn't have been bettered with a real human face!<br/><br/>And even more so when you start questioning the validity of a supposedly human face in the film and realise later on that it really is only computer generated. We're not that far from having indistinguishable, digital human characters on film.<br/><br/> So Toy Story 2 is funny and rather sad. It's a valid and fun exploration of the human condition."

The other reference to Jurassic Park had most of the audience clapping and cheering. The film also jerked a tear out of my wife when we saw what happened to Jessie when Emily left her.

That is all. It really is that predictable. There is absolutely nothing redeeming in this film: The animation hasn't aged too well, the voice acting is poor (Joan Cusack is the worst offender), the direction is extremely shoddy, the musical number makes you want to tear your eardrums out. But the absolute worst thing about this film? The script: Calling it an affront to humanity would be an understatement, there are some truly awful moments of dialogue, stupid sequences that amount to nothing whatsoever, some of the most unoriginal, pathetic film references that have no relation to the storyline whatsoever, just there for pop culture reference. They're not even done with any subtlety, they're just there for the sake of it. It's not even funny, it's a giant groan fest as lame after lame bits of ""wisdom"" fly from every toy's mouth, cheesy and dull one-liners are uttered so often you really will want to kill yourself. Even some of the supposed adult jokes are just plain silly and shouldn't even be there. This was a painfully awful, horrid, boring waste of my life.

I can honestly say that this is one of the worst films I have ever seen in my life: There is nothing good I could possibly say about this, at least other supposed terrible films are so bad they're good. But Toy Story 2 has no redeemable qualities, like Michael Corleone at the end of Godfather Part Two, there is no redemption for it. Now Godfather Part Two, that's an amazing sequel, check that film out once again. Avoid this worthless pile of vomit."

","Normally I really do not like Disney Films, there is something about them that I just don't trust, but I quite enjoyed Toy Story. To me, there seems to be something hidden in Disney movies, and there is just this aura of sickness that surrounds them. Some kids movies I think are fine, but in regards to Disney movies and children, I feel that there is a lot of bad influence coming from them.<br/><br/>Anyway, Toy Story II is the sequel to the successful Toy Story. I personally thought the movie was okay but others seem to think it was really good. I actually found this movie to be quite funny, and enjoyed it as much as some of the children enjoyed it.<br/><br/>Andy, the owner of the toys, goes away on a camp leaving his toys at home. He was going to take the cowboy, but the arm tore so he was put on the top shelf, where discarded toys go. While away, his Mom goes through the room removing toys, and Weezy the Penguin is taken, so the cowboy decides to go and rescue him. During the rescue mission, a collector finds him and steals him to add to his collection so that he might make a lot of money from a Japanese museum. Buzz Lightyear, and the other toys, decide that they will go and rescue him from this fate.<br/><br/>I guess this movie is about friendship and honesty. A typical kids movie, though it does advocate the typical social mores of the modern society. This is especially seen in the Barbie doll scene. What is also cute is Rex, who is fascinated with playing Nintendo games, and Pigsy is pretty cute as well.<br/><br/>As I mentioned before, this is a kid's movie, so one cannot expect it to be deep. Its pure essence is to entertain children, but a good kid's movie will also entertain the adults as well. I think Toy Story II does that effectively."

","Toy Story 2 brings us back to the magic of toys being able to talk and do things without us knowing. Woody is now falling apart and accidentally gets sold/stolen at a garage sale by a collector who is mearly interested in money because apparently Woody is a collector's item. He was an old TV show that became a merchandiser's dream along with some other crazy characters. But of course, the other toys don't want to loose their friend, so Buzz, Mr. Potatoe Head, the dinosaur, and the slinky dog go out in the city to find Woody.<br/><br/>My favorite sequences were getting across the highway and how the toys used the traffic cones causing a huge accident. Also, Buzz meeting another Buzz Lightyear toy who believes he is a real astronaut and the two get mixed up with the group. The outcome is just a lot of fun.

"FilmOtaku","3","5","20","20 September 2004"," Heaven forbid  I didn't like it
","I'm starting to wonder if there is a purgatory for people like me who actually admit to people that they don't like mainstream films that 'Everybody Loves'. Like 'My Big Fat Greek Wedding' and just about every Meg Ryan film, I just plain didn't like 'Toy Story 2.' (I can hear the audible gasp.) It's not that I am completely jaded when it comes to 'kids' films  or even more specifically Pixar films  I think I chuckled once or twice during the original 'Toy Story' and I actually liked 'Finding Nemo.' While I'll admit that I was basically forced to watch those two films and 'Toy Story 2 for that matter actually, just because it is on the IMDb Top 250 list, I am not afraid to assert that I enjoyed the former two. The latter though. Ugh.<br/><br/>'Toy Story 2' basically picks up where the first left off, the conflict this time being that Woody is stolen and is about to be sent to a Japanese museum with three other toys from his 1950's television show. The other toys he normally hangs out with have to try to rescue him before this happens. <br/><br/>I chuckled once, and that was when they showed the 'Rock-em Sock-em Robots.'<br/><br/>That was pretty much all I could muster for this film, which I found to be boring and lame. The story was topical in terms of the whole 'collector' idea, sure. But it was flat and just plain banal. I didn't find the little one-liners remotely endearing, and what I found nostalgic in the first one (the toys themselves) were old news by the second film. <br/><br/>I guess I'm not cut out for these kinds of films; either I expect a little more, or I just don't like typical kid's films. Unfortunately, when a film is released and people go absolutely nuts over it and tell me that I 'have' to see it, and it appears on the same list with films like 'Citizen Kane' and 'Annie Hall', I expect a higher-caliber offering, and others have to expect that there are going to be people who don't like the films that 'everybody' likes. 'Toy Story 2' is one of them for me. Sorry folks. <br/><br/>--Shel"

","I just noticed that Toy Story 2 has been voted in the Top 65 movies of all time. Hey up there, what are you thinking? OK, just here me out here for a second.<br/><br/>Lets talk about Toy Story. It was the first completely 3-D movie ever made, truly a milestone in cinematic history. Sure, compared to the dazzling beauty of Final Fantasy and Shrek it may look dated, but its still a classic. Nothing can take that away from it.<br/><br/>Toy Story 2 as a movie, not a sequel, is good. There are a few minor adjustments made to the animation to make it appear better but Woody, Buzz etc. wouldn't exist if it weren't for the original. First off, I think TS2 is a bit too long and overdrawn for an animated movie. Buzz could have been used a little more than he was, and the Emperor Zurg sub-plot was slightly bizzare and un-necessary.<br/><br/>I liked the way the original was a buddy-buddy comedy which wasn't serious and didn't involve a romance as the basic plot. In TS2 it was way too predictable that Woody and Jessie would fall in love. The rendition of ""When She Loved Me"" was the films downfall and an obvious flaw. It was totally un-needed and made the film more serious than it should have been.<br/><br/>Jessie the Cowgirl (Joan Cusack) was somewhat, a boring character and shouldn't have been used at all. Stinky Pete (Kelsey Grammar) never made a big impact and was a wasted chance. Buzz (Tim Allen) is as good as he was in the original but seemed too much like the supporting cast in this one. Mr. Potato Head, Rex, Slinky and Ham shuld have been used more. When the cast is too big the best characters don't get enough screentime. One thing the movie needed was a character that would bring chuckles everytime he/she spoke ie. Donkey in Shrek.<br/><br/>Overall this is an adequate movie but an unsatisfactory sequel which seems to be aimed more at children than adults. 5 out of 10."

","The second part takes on the style of the first part, and the theme is somewhat scattered. It is a choice between discussing whether the fate of the toy is reserved for everyone to exhibit or limited to the play of a child. The only thing that touches people in the film is that Tracy recalls a scene in which she was abandoned, and Woody ' s process of choosing loyalty is quite awkward. Even if he chooses his own master, he still cannot solve the contradiction that the core is abandoned. In short, the second part incorporates a lot of movie bridges of the year, but it is not clear when dealing with the core theme."
"tbuchalski","7","1","2","6 July 2019"," Toy Story 2: My Good, Bad, and Ugly
","The Good:
Pixar realized the need to expand on all aspects of this film, because they knew technology available improved and the end product needed to reflect that. And, as a sequel they knew there would be an expectation to raise the bar already set fairly high by the first film. To help achieve that higher goal Pixar truly doubled down on the scope of the narrative. Woody, Buzz, and company spend their time in a variety of locales and are subject to the dangers of the outside world significantly longer than in the first installment of the franchise. By leaving the bedrooms of Andy and Sid, and the arcade of Pizza Planet, Toy Story 2 ramps up the stakes by adding depth to the question ""Will they or won't they succeed?""<br/><br/>The Bad:
A more ambitious and complex story also requires more diligent storytelling to ensure that continuity standards carry over from the initial installment to its sequels. Perhaps there's a good excuse in the narrative failings of this film in the production complications, but there are failings in the storytelling nonetheless. Most glaring of the film's misses are inconsistencies of the film's physical reality. Even as animated films typically benefit from their ability to stray from the laws of the natural world, Toy Story didn't establish these kinds of deviations for the franchise. And so, without an understanding that the Toy Story universe differs from the real world even in small extraordinary ways, when toy horse, Bullseye, can match speed with a passenger plane, or when a bowl of cheese puffs spills and covers the entire floor the thematic depth of the film takes a backseat and leaves the audience asking ""How?""<br/><br/>The Ugly:
As with the first film of this franchise this film is likely only truly surpassed by its successor, Toy Story 3 (Lee Unkrich, 2010). Pixar increases the thematic depth once again from film to film showing its evolution not only in available animation technology, but with storytelling. With Toy Story Pixar presented is with a simple story of jealousy, friendship, and purpose. Those themes return in Toy Story 2, but also includes more about discovery of self, self-worth, and the pitfalls of ego. Stellar narratives are not singular to the Toy Story franchise among Pixar films, but as these films released Pixar demonstrated its ability to craft a franchise through deep emotional connections between the characters and the audience."

This movie works on two levels. It's aimed at younger kids, who will love the wackiness of the characters and the situations they find themselves in, though some of the jokes might sail over their heads (but they'll laugh anyway). It's also aimed at adults, who, when I saw it, laughed louder than the kids at some points. The voice work is excellent, especially Tom Hanks and Tim Allen, reprising their roles from the original. The supporting toys (Mr. Potato Head, Slinky Dog, et al.) have much bigger roles this time around.<br/><br/>This movie has everything: Andy's new dog Buster; two dueling Buzz Lightyears; partying Barbie dolls; three 3-eyed aliens from the original; even the Evil Emperor Zurg!

","After dazzling the world with its groundbreaking debut feature & following it up with another imaginative story, Pixar Animation Studios' third feature film finds them returning to the very story & characters that made its studio a household name. Considered by many to be one of those rare sequels that outshines its predecessor, Toy Story 2 keeps alive Pixar's winning streak and is as inventive, entertaining & fun as the original Toy Story.<br/><br/>Continuing the adventures of Andy's toys, Toy Story 2 begins with Woody being stolen by a vintage toy collector & owner of ""Al's Toy Barn"" who brings him to his apartment where he meets Jessie, Bullseye & Stinky Pete and learns that he's a valuable collectible based on a 1950s TV show. On the other hand, Buzz Lightyear devises a plan to rescue Woody from his captor & enlists the help of Hamm, Mr. Potato Head, Slinky Dog & Rex.<br/><br/>Directed by John Lasseter, Toy Story 2 opens on an impressive note with a visually striking sequence that instantly showcases the various improvements Pixar had made in computer animation, only to follow it up with a few more breakthroughs as the plot progresses. The 3D animation is far more refined, colour composition is accurate to a greater degree & while the characters retain their original design, they're rendered in a more seamless manner.<br/><br/>Screenplay is fabulously written for the team behind it delivers a story that's as interesting, witty & original as its predecessor. Cinematography makes more dynamic use of camera as well as colour palettes, images are sharper & finely detailed than before, Editing is brilliantly carried out for the most part & steadily paces the narrative but its middle act could've used a few more trims. And Randy Newman keeps the story fresh, alive & energetic with another fantastic score.<br/><br/>Reprising their respective roles from the last film, Tom Hanks, Tim Allen & others once again step up to voice their characters with sublime effectiveness while out of the new additions, it's Joan Cusack who leaves the most lasting impression with her exuberant take on Jessie. Its homage to earlier classics is wonderfully carried out, the themes are nicely addressed & although it employs the same out-of-box thinking that made Toy Story a historic success, everything about this sequel feels fresh, new & redesigned.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, Toy Story 2 is another fascinating blend of a heartfelt story, rich set of characters & cutting-edge animation from Pixar that's ingeniously directed, deftly written, gorgeously photographed, firmly edited & mesmerisingly scored and is a work of quality filmmaking that sets a new benchmark for sequels in animation. While Toy Story is superior in my opinion, Toy Story 2 still manages to be a worthy follow-up to its predecessor & is another timeless classic from the animation studio that has always dared to think differently."

Woody is unaware that in the years since his model went out of production, he's become a rare and valuable collector's item. An avid toy collector decides that he wants Woody for his collection and swipes him, so Buzz Lightyear, Hamm, Rex, Slinky Dog, and Mr. Potato Head venture forth to rescue their kidnapped friend before Andy returns.<br/><br/>Toy Story 2 is a brilliant example of that rarest of Hollywood phenomena a sequel to a major hit film thats as good, if not better, than the original.It is colorful and funny, and the computer-animation from Pixar Animation Studios creates a convincingly detailed environment for the toys.Added to that,the toys are back with even more hilarious vengeance.

","I actually can't believe that this film is as old as it is (1999). I just viewed it for the first time and I have to say that it was an average film overall. The 3-D animation is top notch by 1999 standards, the storyline matured a bit, but then came the big letdown at the end of the film as the plot reaches its climax.<br/><br/>The first half-hour is something of a ""showing off"" of 3-D animation with the brilliant Buzz Lightyear game sequence. The next half-hour is perhaps the best of the film, where the oft-talked about theme about the usefulness of toys crops up. I think some very good questions (some of which I wondered about whilst watching Toy Story) were raised, such as ""what happens to the toys?"" or ""do they feel betrayed?"", ""do they expect to be betrayed?"".<br/><br/>The last half-hour is what I call plot fulfillment. Essentially, a the plot had to be wrapped up, a tangible, defeatable foe had to be found and defeated and all had to return to the(relative) norm. It is because of this, that the biggest letdown occurs. The questions raised are never resolved, but are glossed over by the toys' attempt to retrieve Woody. And to give the audience a tangible foe, the writers saw fit to make the prospector a quasi-villain. All of the sudden, he becomes belligerent whereas before, he was a voice of some reason. There is no real reason given for this sudden change of heart. In any case, we're supposed to rejoice at his misfortune of being tortured by some ""artist"" girl.<br/><br/>I know I can't expect some sort of masterpiece, but I thought this was a major oversight, or, perhaps worse, a deliberate move to sidestep questions the writers couldn't satisfy. In any case, I never have been of the opinion that children need to put their brains in storage until adulthood...<br/><br/>All in all, not a bad popcorn flick, but probably not Top 250 material."

","This worked for me for three reasons.  1) a great, funny film in itself, 2) I loved TOY STORY, and 3) the trailers ran for three seconds and so didn't give anything away.  I also didn't know who would be in it apart from the main characters so it was fun guessing along the way.  What is really apparent from watching this film is how far the technology has progressed since TOY STORY.  This was already evident in Pixar's more recent offering, A BUG'S LIFE which boasted of great attention to detail and a blooper reel attached to the credits.  The first time I saw TOY STORY 2 I caught the reel, but the second time I wasn't so lucky.  This has caused a real hoo-ha on Sydney's 2BL 702 and I think it's dodgy and ungenerous (since they're in such a good position) for the distributors to have two different versions floating around.  Especially since I saw it for the second time so I could enjoy them all over again.  But, on with the film.  The fantastic visuals combined with the funny script, STAR WARS references and in-jokes (2 references made to films by Tom Hanks) make this a great sequel which surpasses its predecessor.  My favourite part would have to involve the second Buzz Lightyear and that raised eyebrow and megawatt smile of his, the true sign of an American *hero* displayed on publicity posters cracks me up every time.

The first one was a ""we have to save a toy"" plot. If you like that and want to see it rehashed, then perhaps you'll like the sequel. Toy Story 2 seemed to me as A) a direct-to-video movie, and B) made for a younger audience. I've tried to watch it several times, still turn it off around 45-60 minutes in. At least on DVD I was able to skip to the end to see how it wraps up. The toy collector plot was simply boring, as were the new characters. Some clever ideas; instead of running into a bunch of the 3-eyed aliens, how about a bunch of Barbies? Actually, why not set Toy Story 2 mostly in a toy store? Imagine the amount of visual gags available, who cares if its basically the same plot? Toy Story 1 was original and entertaining from start to finish - Toy Story 2 was just annoying (the cowgirl, horse and toy collector stuff was uninspired - and I LOVE westerns - probably great for toddlers). I see great reviews so apparently its a loved film, until I can make it through the whole thing, I guess I'll never understand... There is no way I would even bother watching a 3rd one if they make another sequel - especially considering the great reviews for part 2. AND after Cars? Lost a lot of love for Pixar.

","3 ½ * Toy Story 2 2 thumbs up Reviewed By Matt Doolittle<br/><br/>	Toy Story 2 was a great movie that deserves all the money it gets.  The Movie was thrilling and great for people of all ages.  It kept your fascination throughout the whole movie.  It had comedy, drama, and music by professional musicians.  Woody and Buzz Light-year  (Tom Hanks and Tim Allen) are both excellent together, as in the original Toy Story.  People wanted a great movie and what people want people receive.<br/><br/>	They only thing keeping this movie from 4* was it had 3 different plots going on at once.  One plot was to rescue woody; another plot was keeping Jesse, Bullseye and stinky Pete (the prospector) from going to the museum; and the third plot was destroying Zerg.  Even though there were 3 plots they all ran pretty smoothly."

"zkonedog","10","1","3","10 March 2017"," Is There Such A Thing As A Perfect Film?
","After the first Toy Story film (released in 1995) wowed audiences, the public clamored (despite the Pixar policy of not making animated films into sequel franchises) for an encore. Thus, in 1999, Toy Story 2 was released and, remarkably, surpassed even the highest of expectations, besting the original (no small feat).<br/><br/>For a basic plot summary, this film sees Sheriff Woody (voiced by Tom Hanks) get ""kidnapped"" by a money-hungry toy collector, who needs the Woody doll to complete the now-infamous set from the classic ""Woody's Roundup"" TV show (the origins of the Woody doll). With Andy away at cowboy camp, Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen) and the rest of the toybox gang plot and execute a rescue mission. Little do they know, though, that Woody, upon meeting the rest of his gang-- Stinky Pete (Kelsey Grammar), horse Bullseye, and Jessie the Cowgirl (Joan Cusack)--forms a bond that may lead him to spend the rest of his shelf-life inside a museum.<br/><br/>What really makes this film work is that the writers/producers made the brilliant decision to include Woody's backstory into the movie, as it would have been very easy to focus (once again) on Buzz and have the cowboy play second-fiddle. Instead, the story actually hones in on Woody and the big decisions he must make. Of course, the entire film is also filled with hilarious sight gags, situations, and jokes that both children and adults will enjoy with equal enthusiasm. In terms of both humor and storytelling, this effort eclipses the original by quite a wide margin.<br/><br/>Plus, the addition of the Bullseye and Jessie characters are welcome (and vital) new additions to the show, as their presence leads to some pretty tense emotional drama. In a music-video montage involving the girl Jessie doll, you may find yourself holding back (or letting go) tears. The best part of it is, you won't even feel as if you are watching nothing but a bunch of carefully constructed pixels...you will come to view them as characters as real as you or I.<br/><br/>Thus, in a remarkable feat, Pixar was able to improve on the ground-breaking original Toy Story and take things up even another notch. As Toy Story 3 currently begins playing in theatres across the country, it will be interesting to see if the ante will be upped once again. As usual, it will be a difficult task."
"Hitchcoc","10","1","3","2 January 2017"," The Boys Are Back in Town
","All three Toy Story movies are wonderful. The second continues to feature the adventures of Woody and his sojourn in the greater world. Once he is kept home because of an arm ""injury,"" he finds himself taken away (quite through an accident) and set to be placed in a toy museum. He gets wanderlust as he imagines himself immortal. But what is not there is his friend Andy who left him behind. Soon his friends come to ""rescue"" him because they see what is happening to him. They also come to realize that there is villainy afoot from a man who has a financial interest in him. What happens is that Woody must be rescued from himself as much as the bad guy. I thought the first movie was amazing, but the second is a worthy sequel."
"PetarNeo","9","1","3","6 November 2016"," Almost good as first one
","New adventures by Woody and his friends have come and they were almost as entertaining as the first one. Plot of the second movie is also very entertaining from Woody's kidnap to rescue mission led by Buzz and then confronting another Buzz that was more advanced. In the meantime Woody encountered a Jessie and Stinky Pete that are also cowboy toys. After Woody's arm was fixed he want's to return to Andy but then had a doubt that changed his mind and left him determined to leave with Jessie. Then Buzz and company arrived and persuaded Woody to return but Pete trapped them and they were leaving. In their search for them at airport Woody and Jessie end up on plane but were rescued by Buzz and happily returned to Andy. Movie is a very interesting, with many twists that are often dramatic and leave you in suspense. It has a great story behind it self and is very enjoyable. Sometimes in couple of scenes things are too dramatic and seem stupid, for instance when Woody's horse is running fast as airplane. 3.5/4"

","You can't live without your friends and family. Of course, your family will help you, even if they sacrifice themselves to help you. In terms of friends, it is difficult, but it is so beautiful, and this is said self- sacrifice in Christianity. In this film, the toys go to a shop located at some meters away from their house to help WOODY he is the friend of the toys. The way to the shop is easy for human, however it is so risky for toys; cars, animals and elevator thread them. But someday, you may forget the importance of friends. WOODY becomes to be full of himself, but their friends tell the real value. So this film is important for children but also adult. On the way of their adventure, some animals shows up, but they are so tiny that you can't find them easily. They are ant and caterpillar, and surprisingly they are also characters of a Disney film, BAGZ LIFE it is also CG animation. Like this, In Disney film, many another film character shows up secretly.

"GeorgeRoots","8","1","3","8 August 2014"," ""Toy Story"" Gets A Decent Sequel.
","""Toy Story 2"" originally began as a planned, direct to home release sequel. I also remember it being one of the first highly pirated VHS tapes in the UK.<br/><br/>It's great to see so many new characters and scenario's in this second outing, and as always they cast these things obscenely well. The toy barn and airport scenes are super impressive ""set"" pieces, and hands down the highlight of the movie is when they cross the motorway like something straight out of a Buster Keaton picture.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, I feel the movie has aged over the years. It's still hugely enjoyable, but I don't want to lie to myself and say it's as impressive as the first movie. Even now with the release of ""Toy Story 3"" (2010) that movie had the exact same premise, but the execution was a little more refined.<br/><br/>Final Verdict: After everything that's been said, it's still another gem from Pixar worth seeing. 7.5/10."
"MissSimonetta","9","1","3","7 August 2014"," Better than it's reputation implies
","I was once among the many who considered Toy Story 2 (1999) to be the weakest of the Toy Story trilogy. But re-watching it once more, I think it may even surpass the original in terms of sheer heart.<br/><br/>Though the first Toy Story (1995) was a technical milestone and a masterpiece in its own right, this is the first entry in the trilogy to introduce the themes which would become prominent in the third film: mortality, growing up, and loneliness. Who hasn't cried at Jessie's song, ""When She Loved Me""? Who hasn't related to that kind of alienation or the feeling of growing apart from an old friend? Stinky Pete's ideas on aging and death, and the opposition he receives from Woody and friends gives the film an almost philosophical edge.<br/><br/>In some ways, one could argue that TS2 is superior to its sequel in that there is less unabashed sentiment. While I still love TS3 the most of the series, this is still a fine film and one that deserves more appreciation."

","Rollicking, entertaining adventure. Even better than the first Toy Story.<br/><br/>Good fun, with some great humour, exciting action and some decent drama and emotional content.<br/><br/>As always, the CGI is great. Nothing to fault about the special effects and animation.<br/><br/>Voices are spot-on, as with the first movie. We have the characters from the first movie, of course, but a few new ones too. Wayne Knight is perfect as Al the Toy Collector - he pretty much just had to be Newman again (though I kept thinking ""Newman!"" every time I heard him!). Kelsey Grammar and Joan Cusack are also great as Stinky Pete and Jessie respectively.<br/><br/>Keeping watching during the end-credits: the faux deleted scenes /out- takes are hilarious."

The ending of this film with the Star Wars node and having Zurg be Buzz's father was so awesome and also when we were introduced o the Three Green Aliens, it was so funny.

"OllieSuave-007","10","1","3","28 January 2014"," Toy Story's sequel soars to infinity!
","Disney and Pixar studios team up again and brought us the sequel to the imaginative adventure story about a little boy named Andy who loves playing with his toys, especially with cowboy doll Woody and space ranger figurine Buzz Lightyear. In this sequel, where I think it surpasses the first film with more fun, adventure and entertainment, Andy is away at summer camp and Woody is kidnapped by Al's Toy Barn greedy collector Al McWiggin. He wants to sell Woody along with his cowboy collection-set dolls (from a TV show which Woody learns he was once the star) Jessie the Cowgirl, Stinky Pete the Prospector and Bullseye the Horse to a museum in Japan. The thought of being immortalized forever is tempting to Woody, but his friends back at Andy's house, Buzz, Mr. Potato Head, Slinky Dog, Rex and Hamm attempt to rescue Woody.<br/><br/>Like its prequel, this movie is filmed in brilliant, colorful and detailed computer animation. The story is full of surprises and adventure, from Woody's meeting his new TV Show Round-Up gang to Woody's friends braving the streets and Al's Toy Barn to complete their rescue mission. <br/><br/>Comedy and humor are in abundance here, with some of my favorite funny scenes include the parts where the aliens' constantly pester Mr. Potato Head and Rex's running reflection in the toy car's mirror (a reference to Jurassic Park); you will find many other pop culture references throughout this movie. In addition, I enjoyed seeing the introduction of other new toy characters including Weezy the Penquin, Emperor Zurg, Mrs. Potato Head and Barbie - each like the rest of the toy cast giving his/her own unique personality and toy characteristics. I like the fact that in this movie, all of Andy's toy characters establish more rapport and teamwork than in the previous movie. <br/><br/>Hands down to a great directing and writers team for making one of Disney/Pixar most memorable movies; it's non-stop fun, excitement and adventure, and it also reminds us the value of friendship and being there for someone. One of Disney's best work and overall is one of the best movie sequels of all time.<br/><br/>Grade A"
"wliia","10","1","3","1 November 2013"," My All-Time Favourite Movie
","What is it about this movie that hasn't already been said? It's funny, sad, wonderful and all around brilliant. The film follows Woody (Tom Hanks) being stolen by a greedy toy collector (Wayne Knight). What Woody doesn't know is that he's a valuable collector toy and that he was part of an old 1950s TV show. The rest of the gang must rescue Woody, but Woody finds himself in a difficult position: go back to Andy, knowing he'll outgrow him, or stay with Jessie (Joan Cusack) and the Prospector (Kelsey Grammar) to be looked at for generations.<br/><br/>This film includes in my opinion the best song ever written for film: When She Loved Me. A very sad and beautiful song that really gets to you. It's an ABSOLUTE CRIME that it didn't win the Oscar. Almost as bad as the Twilight Saga existing.<br/><br/>Toy Story 2 is not only the best sequel ever made, it's also my all-time favourite movie."

","This movie was pretty good, but definitely not the best. It had a good story, but the introduction of some of the new characters were a little annoying. I liked it because it has some great humor for kids, and that for me is pretty important. I have to admit though, it was a little better than Wall:e. Wall:e was just awful, and had no sense, but this one was very little like that. Pixar did make this, and that's what makes it good because they are a great group that can make a story, but the brand new characters were pretty bad. To me the introduction of the new characters were just annoying, like I just pointed out before, but when the 3rd Toy Story came out, it really fixed that problem for the new characters.

"shozzas15","10","1","3","18 July 2010"," more profound than gotterdammerung
","Some films just come at you from nowhere & completely subvert your expectations. I'd seen TS1 - I can't remember when, probably around a recent Christmas - & been unexpectedly entertained & amused, so when I sat down to eat my tea last night & found yet more golf on the News Channel & the usual carp elsewhere, I idly flicked to BBC1 & happened upon TS2. My digit hovered over the remote, but, well there was nothing else on & it would be instructive to see how much worse it was than TS1, so, half-heartedly, I continued watching. I rapidly became engaged, I'd missed a fair chunk of the film, but it wasn't difficult to work out the plot. And the toys' characters drew me in. The first rule of any narrative is that you have to care about the characters. That's why I gave up watching Mad Men; ultimately the protagonists were so devoid of any humanity I didn't care whether they lived or died, so something of a paradox that a bunch of toys should have more more emotional depth. Then, with superb timing, they introduced an intriguing moral dilemma for Woody, an actually intractable dilemma which was only partly resolved at the end of the film - rightly so, because it is genuinely intractable, & has to do with the physical nature of our being. Then the cowgirl sang a song. It was a small song about the nature of a child's love for a toy. Except the toy is a surrogate for that forgotten part of us, the spontaneous, loving part of us that we can only know as a child. And thus our relationship with our parents, the World, &, if you like, God.<br/><br/>She sang & I wept.<br/><br/>Ridiculous, I know. The prospect of a sixty rear old man crying over a children's film, but there you go. It's certainly not something that any amount of Wagner, with its overblown, egomaniacal combatants has ever been able to do. Finzi's Dies Natalis has come close though. There you have it then. A beautifully constructed, fast-paced, funny, clever, good-hearted film - even the villains are given some sympathy for their all too human (sic) failings - carrying an unpretentious depth of moral message. Brilliant."

","I've never seen a more gratifying Disney sequel. Unlike the overall majority of Disney straight-to-DVD sequels, this is an actually good movie. For one thing, the whole cast has returned, Tom Hanks (<3) voicing good ole Woody, and Tim Allen as Buzz Lightyear.<br/><br/>John Lasseter returns to direct and because of this kids and adults alike are in for a treat. Randy Newman scores this one and he does a bang-up job. To everyone's delight, the whole set of characters returns. Of course there are a few new characters. Among them is my new favorite, Bull's Eye. So much emotion for so few words. The story is well put together and is more than enough to compete with the original.<br/><br/>As viewers already knew, a dilemma is produced when Woody is stolen, and a hilarious rescue mission ensues. But the screenplay doesn't let down and it turns out returning home will be more of a question of faith and loyalty than rejoice. The characters are incredibly drawn out once again and by the credits you will feel like you just watched the perfect film in a way. The jokes are ones both children and adults will enjoy, all while being quite involving. A rather dramatic sequel that only compounds the fact that ""Toy Story 2"" is an instant success!!"
"Hollywood_Yoda","8","1","3","13 May 2010"," Fine Sequel to a Fine Film
","When I saw this film for the first time over ten years ago, I thought that it was a great achievement in animation and film. Much to my chagrin, two years later in 2001, the Academy Awards added the 'Best Animated Feature' category. With its inception, almost each film released by Pixar afterward has won the category but two or three times, most recently in 2010. I think that if the category had been around when this film was released, it could have easily won. I admit, the story was not as fresh as the original, but was worthy with the addition and expansion of new characters, like Jessie and Bullseye. With the future release of Toy Story 3, I believe the Toy Story franchise will finally see an Oscar win for Best Animated Feature. A superb film, Toy Story 2 was an 8/10 on my movie scale."
"Gotensive","9","1","3","16 October 2009"," A lot of fun
","Like the first Toy Story, I decided to re-watch this one. Unlike the original which I still adore, this one has actually dropped one point in my ratings (It was originally a 10/10, but now I'll drop it to a 9/10). Why? Well unlike the original where I find everything perfect, this movie does have a few annoying moments. I'm not a big fan of the Star Wars references, and the Jessie character gets really annoying with her constant screaming (which is entirely Joan Cusack's fault). I also felt this film lacked a strong central villain (neither Al or Stinky Pete come close to Sid). I also prefer the slightly darker tone of the original more, where as this one felt more ""lighter"", and dare I say ""child-like"". It also felt far more sappier than the original (specifically the Jessie Song). Those complaints aside, I still consider this one a favorite, and the animation does hold up better than the original. The new Buzz is great, and all of the old characters are still funny, as well as the jokes. Even though my rating of this movie dropped one point, I still currently rank this as Pixar's second best as it's superb entertainment that both children and adults can enjoy."

And the song When She Loved Me was beautiful and vital to the story.<br/><br/>The voice talents are also faultless. Tom Hanks and Tim Allen are brilliant here as Woody and Buzz, but they were equally brilliant in the first too. Wayne Knight was also fine as Al, who kidnaps Woody to sell him to a museum.

","""Toy Story 2"" is Pixar's only sequel as of now (until ""Toy Story 3"" hits the big screen), and that's good, because Pixar isn't a company that wouldn't churn out endless amounts of sequels. Pixar might've been forced into making a sequel by Disney, they still turned out a great film. To Pixar, story is important. They wouldn't make a sequel unless the story was as good as, or better, than the original.<br/><br/>For its time, the animation is great, using more realistic details and foliage (many of which is taken from ""A Bug's Life""). It looks so great that it stays up with today's standards (look at ""Cars"", you'll think it's real). Having seen this in 1999, it doesn't get old.<br/><br/>Toy Story 2 continues as Woody is stolen by a greedy toy collector. Buzz and the other toys journey to find him while Woody finds out that he is a vintage toy from a popular Saturday morning show from the 1950s. From there, the story gets more and more exciting with several twists. A worthy sequel and it's definitely as good as ""Toy Story"".<br/><br/>Pixar always keeps it going.

"DaRick89","10","1","3","6 April 2006"," This Toy Story is truly excellent and continues the legacy of the original
","Toy Story, when it came out in 1995, was something of a revolution. It was a definite groundbreaker, on the level of stuff like Star Wars, for nothing like it had been seen before and since then, it has had a slew of followers, none of which have quite lived up to it's greatness (even from Pixar themselves). To date, I have seen story around as often as I have seen Terminator 2 (six or seven times) and, fittingly it ranks up there with my favourite films. So you could imagine my surprise back in 2000 when the sequel to Toy Story, Toy Story 2, continued the legacy of the original. Sure, it isn't quite as groundbreaking, but hell, whatd'ya expect, it's a sequel! To think that Disney was going to make this one straight-to-video. That would've been disgraceful for a film of this magnitude. I have 'only' seen Toy Story 2 around three or four times. As fate would have it, I saw it again last night. As a teenager, I am almost ashamed to be enjoying this film, but hey, that's Pixar for you...not only do they appeal to little kids, they appeal to adults and teens as well. They've always had that mystic quality about them (with the exception of the disappointing A Bug's Life). <br/><br/>The plot is decidedly interesting. Woody winds up with a few old collectables from his old show, The Roundup Gang. Turns out that he is of a lot of value. There's Stinky Pete (look for a hilarious outtake at the end credits which shows why he is called 'Stinky Pete') and Jessie the cowgirl. It is here that, us, as the audience, witnesses a somewhat overly sentimental yet interesting deconstruction of Jessie. How she was abandoned by the girl who loved her. Woody, it would seem, will have to face up to a similar problem when Andy grows up. Buzz Lightyear and his crew get caught up at a toy store. On the way, some funny pratfalls do ensue, such as the regimented wackiness of the 'replacement' Buzz and those three aliens (""Look! It's the mystic portal!""). The outtakes at the end also give us a good reason to stick around.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks and Tim Allen show their funny sides. It is clear here that Tim Allen can be a funny guy sometimes (shame we rarely see this) and he appears to have found his calling with the character of Buzz Lightyear. Tom Hanks plays Woody like he did in Toy Story; as philosophical yet somehow optimistic cowboy who does not know where to go. They are well supported by Joan Cusack and Kelsey Grammar, who play their characters, Jessie and Stinky Pete, appropriately.<br/><br/>There is of course, the animation to discuss. As usual, I will not discuss Pixar's animation in any great depth, since you, the reader, will know what I will say: about how dazzling, clean-cut and colourful it is, etc, etc. <br/><br/>In short, Toy Story 2 is a wonderful film which should not be missed for the world, by kids, adults or even teens. It is right up there with the best of Pixar, second behind only Toy Story. That is only due to the fact that the first Toy Story is more groundbreaking. Try as they might, Dreamworks' best, both of the Shreks, cannot realistically match up to either of the Toy Story movies. Time will fly by as you watch this. Trust me on that!<br/><br/>5/5 stars"

Lee Ermey as Army Sarge, Jonathan Harris as Geri the Cleaner and Jeff Pidgeon as Green Aliens. An excellent sequel with some spoof moments, e.g. Jurassic Park, Goldfinger and Star Wars. It was nominated the Oscar and Golden Globe for Best Song for ""When She Loved Me"", and it won the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Comedy/Musical. It was number 37 on The Ultimate Film, and along with the first film, both were number 4 on The 100 Greatest Cartoons. Outstanding!"
"OriginalMovieBuff21","10","1","3","30 May 2004"," The best animated movie ever!!!
","Toy Story 2 is the best animated movie I have ever seen in my entire life. Beauty and the Beast, The Lion King, Finding Nemo, Fox & the Hound, Monsters, Inc., and Toy Story come extremely close but Toy Story 2 beats them all. This is the best Disney movie and best Pixar film ever. The humor is brilliant especially the funniest character in the movie, Mr. Potato Head. He made me laugh in almost every scene. The dialouge and plot was again excellent from the Toy Story films. This is one of the best sequels and should've earned 4 stars!!! I hope there is going to be a Toy Story 3 but I doubt it since Pixar is retiring. Excellent film!!<br/><br/>10/10!!"
"slokes","7","1","3","12 May 2004"," Solid Sequel Lacks Some Fun
","In addition to pushing the envelope in what animation could do, ""Toy Story"" was such a crowd-pleaser it was a no-brainer to make a sequel. To their credit, the creative team at Pixar used their brains anyway. ""Toy Story 2"" is enjoyable, at times rousing entertainment the whole family can enjoy, but the sometimes clumsy attempts at injecting seriousness into the first movie have become much more overt and annoying.<br/><br/>What's right with ""Toy Story 2""? A lot, beginning with the eyepopping improvements to the animation technology just four years brought. In ""Toy Story,"" in 1995, the human characters like Sid and Andy's baby sister looked more cartoonish than the toys, while Sid's vicious pet Scud looked like an escapee from a late-'80s Commodore computer game. By 1999, the humans are so lifelike it hurts, especially if you are fat and balding like Al (and me.)<br/><br/>Add to that a clever story arc that allows Woody the cowboy doll (voiced by Tom Hanks) to leave Andy's room and discover his true origins, which turn out to be a great deal more impressive than he imagined. A Howdy Doody-like relic of the 1950s, Woody turns out to be quite a prize antique, especially when paired with fellow members of his old Roundup Gang, as assembled by Al, the owner of a giant toy retailer who has stolen Woody from Andy's mother and plans to sell the set to a big-money collector in Japan.<br/><br/>The revelation of Woody's past is pretty clever, especially when we see excerpts of his old show with hilariously bad marionette work. The comedy involving the greedy, porcine Al (Wayne Knight) is well-done, as is the emergency work back in Andy's bedroom to get Woody back where he belongs. The once-acidic Mr. Potato Head (Don Rickles) turns out to be quite the whipped spud now that there's a Mrs. Potato Head (Estelle Harris) in the room. ""I packed your angry eyes, just in case,"" she says, and it's dynamite voice casting, like so much in the first movie.<br/><br/>I never quite got into the Roundup Gang, however. Joan Cusack tries too hard as the spunky cowgirl Jessie, while Kelsey Grammer, terrific in his work as the Simpsons nemesis Sideshow Bob (an obvious inspiration here) brings nothing new to his role here. They are so dull that you wonder why Woody would even think of spending his time with them.<br/><br/>It's ironic that the creators said the story was designed in part to deal with the limited availability of Tom Hanks, because I missed Tim Allen more in this one. Actually, he has a dual role, as two different Buzz Lightyears, one being the space action figure we saw in the first movie, the other being an upgraded version freed from Al's Toy Barn who joins the rescue mission. But the original Buzz, now that he's with the program, is a pale echo of his old self (which was more of a friendly, fair-playing rival of Woody's than a second banana) while the new Buzz recycles a lot of the fish-out-of-water lines old Buzz had in the first film, because, like old Buzz in the first film, he's just out of the box and doesn't know what's what.<br/><br/>The movie goes off into some strange existential territory for a while, about the futility of a toy's existence which takes itself very seriously. Woody decides to leave Andy, seeing clearly a future where the boy will chuck him for more grown-up pursuits. One comment I read here asks if this is right; that many children, seeing this movie, might be reluctant to give a toy to charity, which is what we see happen to Jessie here. Worse crimes have been committed in the name of art then discouraging toy donations, but it does feel like this film is advocating an unnaturally backward position upon its core audience.<br/><br/>Yeah, okay, enough dime-story philosophy. You will have a good time watching ""Toy Story 2"" if you liked the first one, and most people did. It's funny, fresh, and exciting, especially with the rescue mission, and the animation is spectacular. But why do people say this is the better film? Other than the technology, it's in every way a lesser product."
"Mulliga","10","1","3","11 February 2003"," Best. Sequel. Ever.
","Better than ""Godfather II"", ""Terminator 2"", or even ""Empire Strikes Back"", ""Toy Story 2"" is quite possibly the best sequel ever made. It takes the boundaries of the original movie and pushes them back as far as the eye can see. The characters are more rounded and more believable, their problems are incredibly mature and universal, and the heart that the first movie had is still preserved.<br/><br/>I still remember watching this gem for the first time in the theater with my sister. We were nervous - could a sequel to ""Toy Story"" possibly be any good? About an hour and a half later, we came out of the theater, grinning ear to ear.<br/><br/>SPOILERS<br/><br/>I mean, anyone who doesn't get teary-eyed at ""When She Loved Me"" must not have a soul. It's that sad. There was one part of the movie, right before the gang got out of the apartment building, where I said to myself, ""If they chase Jessie all the way to the airport, this will officially be the most fun I've ever had watching a movie."" And you know what? They DID."

Toy Story 2 should be re-named to<br/><br/>Toy Story Version 2.0 because it improves from the original<br/><br/>formula and brings new features. The Story is again a rescue<br/><br/>mission, and the characters show they have matured from the<br/><br/>original (I advice you see it before this one, if you haven't),<br/><br/>yet, they had to bring back the ""unmatured"" version of Buzz<br/><br/>Lightyear for a while because he's so much funnier that way.<br/><br/>I saw this movie at a digital projector screening in San<br/><br/>Francisco, which improved tenfold the already amazing animation. <br/><br/>And if that weren't all, the audience was treated with a long<br/><br/>(very long) preview of Disney next digital wonder: Dinosaur.

"MovieAddict2016","10","1","3","30 July 2001"," A great family film for all ages
","First off, I'll say that I own both Toy Story movies, I don't like this one any better than the first one, I'fd give them both 4 stars, for creating something very hard to do in todays age. A family film for all ages to enjoy.  The plot is after a greedy Toy Collector steals Woody(voiced by Hanks, once again), Woody finds out he once had his own show named ""WOOOODY'S Roundup!"", and in the show had a deputy cowgirl Jesse(Joan Cusak) and a Prospector by the name of Stinky Pete(Kelsey Grammer)who is still in his original box.And last but not least, a horse named Bullseye. Meanwhile Buzz and the gang go on a search for Woody, but time's running out for them, because Al the greedy toy collector is going to ship Woody and his new friends out to Japan for a reasonable amount of money. And Woody's new gang is convincing him to come with them. Filled with laughs for all ages, Toy Story and TOY STORY 2 are great for all ages. I especially liek in this one, after Woody wrips his arm Al calls in a toy repairman, who is none other than the old chess player in one of Pixar's first mini-movies. You can find the short with the chess player on A BUG'S LIFE,another Disney/Pixar film. 4 stars for both movies, and now I think I'll go comment on the original Toy Story"
"La Gremlin","10","1","3","1 January 2001"," Perfection
","I was a little worried when I read that there was a made-for-video sequel to ""Toy Story"" in the works, and even more worried when I found out it was going to be released in theaters (three words: ""Doug's First Movie""). Turned out my fears were completely unfounded.<br/><br/>""TS2"" is the rare sequel that not only lives up to the original, but outdoes it.  That's no small feat in this case!  The characterization is excellent, and the animation is incredible.  Most importantly, the story is surprisingly moving (I guarantee you'll be bawling during Jesse's song), and there's more action in any given frame of film here than in most recent thrillers.<br/><br/>And ya gotta love the scenes parodying ""Star Wars"".  <br/><br/>This rates a perfect ten.  I only wish there was an eleven."
"krumski","6","1","3","22 February 2000"," It's good, BUT. . .
","Don't have any major axe to grind with this one; it's an enjoyable and entertaining movie, perfect for the whole family. Go see it. But please don't make the ridiculous claim that it's better than the first one. The first one had the true spark of originality - this one is a mere updating, a scrupulous ploy to revisit all the good bits pioneered by its predecessor. Don't get me wrong - it does an exceedingly good job of this, and finds creative and imaginative ways to recycle the material without making the audience feel that it's just seeing the same old thing again (I particularly liked the way it worked in a *second* Buzz Lightyear action figure, so that we could have the fun all over again of a Buzz totally clueless as to his own doll-hood). But, really, when you get right down to it, we *are* seeing the same old thing again: the characters haven't expanded or grown any (how can they, after all - they're TOYS!!) and the plot mechanism is exactly the same - a daring rescue mission to save a toy in trouble. And it suffers the same malady which infects every sequel, the desire to do everything bigger and more opulently, which undermines the low-key charm the original had; instead of staying within the parameters of the neighborhood and a back-yard world, TS2 takes its heroes, more improbably (and impersonally), through crowded city streets, local shopping malls, high-rise office buildings, and finally into the bowels of a large modern airport. All of this is done with wit and originality, but it seemed to contradict the fundamental premise of the first one, which is that any step outside of the bedroom is a dangerous and unlikely one for a toy to make.  What's more, the egregious Sarah McLachlan song in the middle of the movie is one of the most lachrymose bits of over-stated sentimentality ever seen in a Disney movie and almost made me want to bolt from the theater in disgust. The first movie had nothing so wildly embarrassing (the Randy Newman songs being utterly perfect).<br/><br/>The moral quandary Woody faces here is interesting, but it's almost too big a theme to introduce into a story of this nature. I was left unconvinced that he would choose the road of built-in obsolescence, represented by going back to Andy, as opposed to the assured ever-lasting fame of being enshrined in the museum. I ended up feeling sorry for the Stinky Pete character, who was supposed to be the villain but in actuality made some pretty good, hard-to-refute points about the ephemeral nature of being a mere child's plaything. You might say I was thinking about this too hard, but the story premise is an intriguing one, and seems to invite more allegorical and philosophical speculation than it delivers; it pulls back in the end and reverts to its big adventure chase mechanics. It seems to me that the first Toy Story did not make this fundamental mistake of biting off more than it could chew; plot, theme, and action were all perfectly integrated in that movie, making it truly one of the minor classics of our age.<br/><br/>Anyway - just needed to get that all off my chest. TS2 is an enjoyable movie, no question about it, one of the best of the year. But because of the absolute perfection of its predecessor, I just couldn't help feeling it was somewhat hollow and regurgitated. Here's hoping that Pixar does the smart thing and puts Woody, Buzz and the rest of the gang permanently away in some digital toybox somewhere, letting them live on forever in the shimmering perfection of our memories."

"HonestReviews","1","2","15","29 March 2016"," Like the Original...Awful!
","Having seen the awful Toy Story, (be sure to see my review of that), I hoped that the filmmakers would have learned from their mistakes and produced a film that actually required you to have an IQ above 10 to enjoy it. Clearly the makers failed and didn't take on feedback from before.<br/><br/>Car crash. Let's start with that horrible sequence in which the toys cross the road hidden under cones. Lots of cars spin out of control and crash into each other. It's a huge collision! Yet only an hour or so later when the toys cross the road again, there is no damage whatsoever! Surely a crash that big would take days to clear up, not to mention the amount of news reporters covering the scene. How can the filmmakers not have noticed this major plot hole.<br/><br/>Security Cameras. I know 1999 is still in the period when humans were dumb, but we had basic cameras back then. For some reason, these security cameras don't pick up toys breaking about and moving in a toy store! Likewise they don't appear to exist in airports as the toys steal a luggage cart and escape through LOCKED gates without being stopped?! How was this not noticed, why wasn't there a massive inquiry? It's ludicrous that the filmmakers missed this.<br/><br/>New Toys? When Andy returns Jessie and Bullseye are now part of his toy collection. Yes we hear him shout ""thanks mom"" but I highly doubt that would be the end of it. Surely he would have brought this up later to her and she would have been confused as to what he meant. They would then ultimately discover and believe that these toys appeared from nowhere and ended up in Andy's room somehow. Admittedly believing the toys are alive wouldn't be their first belief as to how they got there, but they would still inquire and presumably call the police about a creepy intruder delivering toys to Andy's room. This scene must have not made the final cut of the film.<br/><br/>There are other plot holes that I really can't be bothered to mention. Mainly a toy horse catching up with both a plane and a luggage cart. The fact that toys can safely break into an airport without being spotted by security or security cameras and the fact that we STILL have no answer as to why toys can't reveal they're alive to humans. An awful film made by idiots who still haven't learnt from their prior mistakes. 1/10."

","...and I dare say most underrated as well! Well, this a review I'm FINALLY gonna be typing out for a film that really deserves it.<br/><br/>And I think it deserves a rating HIGHER than ""7.9"" - like seriously?? I read that earlier it had a ""8.1""!<br/><br/>Now I watched the first Toy Story a ZILLION times before this sequel was released - and rightfully so. I mean I was no more than 5, and the playroom with the television set & VHS player was just my jam! (NOt to mention those fun CD games I used play on Windows computers) But, I'm even quite a big movie buff today; but most of the time, I now usually make YouTube videos discussing the issues of Science, Creation, Evolution, and Dinosaurs.<br/><br/>Anyways, this film was the very first movie I saw in the THEATER! I was just 7 years old! And at that point in my life, not only did life feel so innocent & easy, but I liked movies not so much for their story, but more for their visuals - and Toy Story 2 had that in DROGUES! (As well as ""Phantom Menace"", though that's a flick generally everyone almost hates.)<br/><br/>Furthermore, most often times, I seem to meet people (especially in Japan here) who either know more about the first Toy Story, or the most recent 3rd one. I feel as if a lot people aren't referencing this movie ENOUGH! And though it is somewhat generally well-known, I still feel as if doesn't get enough attention it deserves! I mean, you've got a much better story (compared to the 1st or 3rd one, IMO), lots of new characters (Zurg being my favorite), an AMAZING intro with Buzz (which quite literally BLEW me away when I was just 7 years old in that theater), there being comic references to Japan (the country where I was born & now live in - which kinda asks the question, why isn't this film more famous here if Japan got referenced a lot, like in ""Cars 2""?), amazing plot twists, a climax that takes place in an airport (Oh, and I just *love* airports & airplanes - they're my favorite form of travel, though I haven't used them very often), jokes that work with both children and adults, great pop-cultural references (like ""Star Wars - Empire Strikes Back colorful characters, stunning animation, great character study, pretty memorable songs, soundtrack, scenes, and quotes, HILARIOUS blooper end credits that just keep making me laugh over & over etc.<br/><br/>And a good thing the movie was nominated for an Oscar (AT ALL!) for the song ""When Somebody Loved Me"" - and rightfully so. That's a song that my sisters kept singing out of the blew almost every year I was growing up - just to mention for laughs.<br/><br/>But I believe it's THIS movie that should've won PIXAR an Oscar for Best Animated Film much earlier - not Toy Story 3, really; I think that's one that should've gone to ""How To Train Your Dragon"". I'm serious. <br/><br/>And I almost felt something was LACKING from the 3rd Toy Story; I don't know if it was the look of the animation, or whether the ""traveling"" feel was absent, or if the jokes were too lame, or that I didn't cry at the end, or if the possible fact the movie seemed purely fueled by nostalgia purposes - I'm just still confused as to why it's made it on the Top 250 on IMDb. <br/><br/>Shouldn't it be THIS movie instead!? <br/><br/>Or who knows! Maybe the 3rd one DOES deserve to be up there, and I just don't know something that others do.<br/><br/>And it's definitely one of the movies that Tom Hanks should be known for on his IMDb profile, rather instead of say ""The DaVinci Code"" or ""The Green Mile"" (those are just two films I can't stand, 'cause I either find them too overrated, too controversial, or just too weird) - Hanks' voice is just so well-acted in this movie (or fair enough, in the other two Toy Story's), I just imagine all the gestures & hand motions he must've done behind that microphone. lol Hey, he's an actor - he be as colorful, or over-the-top as he wants.<br/><br/>Toy Story 2... It's just too good! In my opinion, it's WAY better than either 1 or 3. Not only do I think this is this one of the greatest sequels ever, it's also my favorite PIXAR movie, one of my favorite Disney movies, definitely one my favorite movies ever, and surely one of greatest movies of all time!!<br/><br/>(FUNNY TRIVIA: It was this movie from where I learned the basic directions of LEFT & RIGHT - and my memory keeps coming back to it! hahaha)<br/><br/>Someone PLEASE get this back onto the Top 250 on IMDb! I BEG you!<br/><br/>10/10<br/><br/>PS: But now, I wonder what they're gonna do with Toy Story 4?? I hope it'll be a great story, and a smart one, if they're really serious about returning to this franchise again... <br/><br/>peace out, IMDb users! ;)"

Instead, Toy Story 2 brought both more emotional stakes and humor throughout. The humor is the thing that really stood out (Hamm saying ""You heard of kung fu? Well get ready for pork chop!"" is absolutely hilarious), and was a mix of child and adult targets for the jokes that worked well. The end credits bloopers jokes, the adorable alien men, the Star Wars reference, and countless great lines all worked perfectly for me. In addition, the scene with Jessie's backstory was a heart wrenching adolescent development story that made us love Jessie in the span of a couple minutes. The plot twist with the prospector was a solid and legitimate one, and all the characters had their distinct personalities and humors as in the first. The ending had a bit more suspension of disbelief and wild turns of events (speaking of suspension of disbelief, it seems crazy how valuable Woody is - if he was such a big phenomenon, how are there not more of him available?), but it was still easy to not worry about it overmuch and get carried away wtih Buzz, Woody, and Jessie's energy.

Woody is stolen by a toy collector, causing the toys to set out on a mission to rescue him.<br/><br/>'Toy Story 2' is different from the first movie.

The villain is not completely evil and unreasonable. In a way, Al McWhiggin is similar to Toy Story's Sid. He does not know that the toys are sentient. The secondary antagonist of Stinky Pete has a motivation to want to be protected. He had the right idea in wanting to be preserved.<br/><br/>The cast does an excellent jb in this movie.

","The makers of ""Toy Story"", which made history as the first family film entirely animated by computer, actually manage to outdo themselves here. This sequel packs a lot of energy and adventure, as well as some real poignancy, into its trim 93 minute run time. Better yet, it's quite interesting and thoughtful in the way it portrays the relationship of toys to their owners. Yes, all of us do grow up and, to an extent, outgrow our childhood playthings, but when we are young, our toys can mean a lot to us. And ""Toy Story 2"" memorably illustrates the idea that any toy has worth if it it utilized, and loved, by a child. It is ultimately this lack of self-worth that drives a certain character in their mission.<br/><br/>Woody (Tom Hanks, in fine form) ventures outside to save a wheezy squeaky-toy penguin (Joe Ranft) from falling victim to a yard sale. Unfortunately, an unscrupulous, ambitious collector (Wayne Knight) sees Woody, recognizes him for his worth, and steals him. You see, once upon a time, the character was a TV phenomenon, spawning all sorts of merchandising. In the collectors' apartment, Woody meets the other characters from the show - Bullseye the horse, Stinky Pete the prospector (Kelsey Grammer), and ""yodelling cowgirl"" Jessie (Joan Cusack), who awaken him to his history. And Woody soon finds this enticing. Meanwhile, Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen) and several of Woody's fellow toys embark on an often perilous mission to get Woody back.<br/><br/>There's so much action in this that it could actually rival a typical live-action treatment of such material. Family members will enjoy the thrills - as well as the abundant sentiment, and the many genuinely funny moments. New characters such as Jessie and Bullseye are quite endearing, and some of the old favourites are as hysterical as ever. Wallace Shawn is particularly hysterical as toy dinosaur ""Rex"", and there's a brief gag referencing ""Jurassic Park"" that made this viewer laugh out loud. One could argue that it's all a little TOO much, with the screenwriters, directors, and company throwing one big roadblock after another into the path of our heroes.<br/><br/>One clever touch is to revisit the idea of a toy that has no idea that they are, in fact, a toy, and takes themselves much too seriously. This happens when Buzz encounters another of his brand, and the other Buzz keeps making things difficult. Al the collector is just a perfect opportunist slime ball, and Buzz' nemesis Zurg is a hoot (there's an unexpected reference to a legendary moment in The Empire Strikes Back along the way).<br/><br/>You sure can't argue with success: this formula of Pixars' has worked much more often than not.<br/><br/>Eight out of 10."

","Four years passed since the huge success of ""Toy Story"" and the producers Pixar and Disney had not yet fully believed the amount of tickets and the technological innovation and follow-up that they had created. For his part, Lasseter began to work again (after his excellent insect fable) to get a sequel that was at the level of its predecessor, and go if he did, reaching to overcome it in many ways. 'Toy Story 2' is the best example of how to make the perfect sequel, which improves even the first one. The script is more worked, with a wonderful prologue heir of modern science fiction, and the characters are more nuanced and defined, as well as the incursion of new characters that will be decisive in the development and resolution of the plot. The adventures, humor and action continue giving us unforgettable moments that will undoubtedly go down in the history of cinema, worthy of a master. The rhythm returns to no truce at any time of the footage and entertainment is once again top-level for all audiences, wishing that the film does not end.<br/><br/>As for the script, Lasseter again gets another absolute wonder that shows all his enormous talent by perfectly combining a hilarious and hilarious comedy with a pure adventure tape in miniature size, and leaving moments for the memory and reassuring the suspense in many sections and the spectacularity in the action scenes.<br/><br/>In short, a very good sequel to that wonder that was 'Toy Story', coming to surpass it in many ways as a more elaborate plot and an excellent prologue, with a really fun script and loaded with suspense, adventures and action full of dynamism and a contagious joy, that transform 'Toy Story 2' into an unrepeatable and impenetrable wonder from beginning to end.<br/><br/>· THE BEST: the dynamism and the enormous entertainment it provides. The script. The prologue The hilarious nod to 'Star Wars'.<br/><br/>· THE WORST: still nothing happens to me."

The story was even more interesting, and takes you into a whole new adventure. I really liked some of the new toys introduced into this movie such as the Emperor Zurg - really like the way it looks. My favourite one was the horse called Bullseye - he is so cute and adorable. I think it was these two new characters or toys which made Toy Story 2 a success.

","It occurred to me while watching that for those viewers who were between the ages of eight and twelve years old when the picture came out, that this film will resonate strongly in the nostalgia department once they achieve adulthood, just like my kid shows of the Fifties bring back so many warm memories of that time. Stuff like ""The Roy Rogers Show"", ""Andy's Gang"" and ""Crusader Rabbit"". Say, there was an Andy who became a TV friend even back then; that would have been Andy Devine, who also doubled as Roy Rogers' sidekick in a handful of B Westerns. <br/><br/>This was a nice follow up to the original ""Toy Story"", and reinforced the idea of having a friend by being a friend. Cowboy Woody learned that there was a lot more to his legacy as a famous toy than he ever realized, but eventually figured out that there's even more value in being with friends and family than there ever would be as a top shelf collectible. I liked the new toys that showed up in this story, like Cowgirl Jessie and Penguin Wheezy, and it's too bad Stinky Pete turned out to be a villain, he reminded me a little of Warner Brothers' Yosemite Sam.<br/><br/>In general, I'm not a big animated movie fan but there was something about this one that struck me in just the right way. I guess part of it is the nostalgia factor I mentioned earlier, along with the delightful color rendition and clever sight gags throughout the movie. When I get involved with these stories, I lose all sight of who's doing the voice animation and never even think about it. This one even threw in some 'bloopers' if you will to go with the after movie credits, another quirky idea that someone came up with that works to make the ending even more enjoyable."

","My headline sum up the most admirable thing about Toy Story. Pixar had enough respect towards their 1995 mega hit to put effort into making a spectacular sequel. <br/><br/>Woody is faced with hard choices here about himself being a collector's item and therefore immediately desired by the toy enthusiast Al who brings him to his own place with lots of merchandise. One of them is a TV-show with co-puppets a cowgirl named Jessie, a horse named Bull's Eye and a prospector named Stinky Pete.<br/><br/>Jessie is a really well made character with an emotional back-story which always makes me cry a little. The song ""When She Loved Me"" is a perfect song illustrating her emotional scars. That song easily ranks among Randy Newman's best. <br/><br/>Every conflict faced in this movie is perfect. When you find yourself torn between both choices, you know it is great. Woody wants to stay with his newly acquired fame and free his new friends from being left as an incomplete collection, but also to go back to Andy. <br/><br/>There are also a lot of great laughs. Lots of jokes about other toys and the situations they find themselves in. I could go on for ever about how much I like Toy Story 2. <br/><br/>Go see it if you haven't and do your kids a favor and show all Toy Story movies to them."

","I should say that ""Toy Story 2"" isn't a masterpiece, but still entertaining. What I particularly liked about it is how we see some characters' histories expanded and even get introduced to the evil Emperor Zurg (Buzz's sworn enemy). As usual, there are some references to movies outside the franchise to catch the adults' attention.<br/><br/>So, the tykes will probably enjoy the action while the parents will laugh at the references. Not my favorite movie by any stretch but still fun. I suspect that back when Wallace Shawn first made a splash in ""My Dinner with Andre""*, no one ever envisioned him voicing a toy dinosaur in a Disney movie (or even starring in a movie like ""The Princess Bride"").<br/><br/>*My parents met him and Andre Gregory around the time that MDwA got released.

The music is moody and Randy Newman is at his best with the really non-disturbing, appropriate song about Jessie, which is definitely the message of this film.<br/><br/>O.K., I know I'm raving, but I really meant it when I chose the ten and clicked the ""Vote"" button. This film is great and I recommend it to every film-lover.<br/><br/>A few downsides (this hardly affects the overall film) are I think, first of all the lack of originality, which is excusable and acceptable for a sequel. Second, the still somewhat jerky animation of the humans (I know they said it was supposed to be, but I disagree that). And third: the ratio, 1:1,85 (I thought it was the theater, but Pixar is forgiven, seen the quality of the film.)

","Toy Story 2 is the sequel to the movie Toy Story of 1995 and when the movie was in the drawing broad it was planed to be a direct-to-video sequel for up to 1999 Discey had a habit to make such films and always lacked the magic of the original theatrical installment. The examples are too many to count, but just for the record some of them are The Return of Jafar, Beauty and the Beast: The Enchanted Christmas, Pocahontas II: Journey to a New World and The Lion King II: Simba's Pride. All of them are either disappointed or down right a insult to the original, with the exception of Lion King 2, which although it isn't great ,its story and character are decent.<br/><br/>But due to the popularity of the original and the quality of the story the Discey studio decided to give to the film a proper theatrical release. So in 1999 the film opened and immediately critics, audience and in general everyone loved it! Some of the critics even said that it out shined the original. Personally I disagree for the Toy Story trilogy is so well made that I see it as one animated film of four hours and forty minutes run time! <br/><br/>Now the story follows Woody, Buzz and the the rest of the gang to their new adventures. During the film Woody is stolen by a collector who wants to sell him for profit and has it is know you mess with one, you mess with everyone and so the gang organize and send a rescue team with Buzz himself as the leader! I loved that Buzz when he saw his friend in trouble he didn't though twice to go and save him, this shows that after the events of the first Toy Story how close are these two, indeed one of the best bromance in cinema history! Also we learn about the history of Woody as a Toy and the depth of Woody and Buzz friendship, man a Cowboy and a Space Ranger as best friends, awesome. <br/><br/>In the previous film the theme was identity and that you can determine it yourself. Here is how much important is to be part of a family, team and generally have a place to call home. And the trouble our rescuers face in order to save Woody really shines that importance and put Bernard and Miss Bianca to shame! We also meet new characters that are just as spirited and fun as the main cast with Jessie steal something more than the show, Buzz you know what I mean ;).<br/><br/>To conclude, just watch it and if you have kids watch it with them, for this is one of the best family films of all time, and for those who have already watch ""I am your father"". Even then Star Wars was referenced in films!"

","Toy Story 2 was the sequel that confirmed Pixar was here to stay. After A Bug's Life didn't do as well as the company could have hoped for, they needed a huge hit.

In this one, Woody is stolen by the creepy toy collector we all turned out to be (played by Wayne Knight), and Andy's toys must go out and rescue him before Andy gets back from Cowboy Camp. Meanwhile, Woody finds out he's a rare toy from an old television marionette show when he meets Jessie (Joan Cusack), Stinky Pete (Kelsey Grammar), and a horse named Bullseye, who were all characters on the show as well. So the toys are on a hilarious, exciting, and fun adventure while Woody needs to decide where his loyalties lie. This movie is as good and, in many ways, better than its predecessor. It's absolutely hilarious, with so many gags is possible to miss quite a few of them in the first viewing. The animation is improved upon. The adventure has high stakes. Everything feels like an action film, except for kids. However adults cam find so much enjoyment too. This film tackles abandonment and growing up, and what it means to be loved. Absolutely amazing.

Moreover, he meets new friends and the friend's existence assists him to bother more, which way to take. Finally he decides to return to home, and this suggests the importance of friends. Going back to home means that Woody will live along Andy. And someday this life is going to end, because Andy will not play with toys forever. On the contrary, if Woody had gone to a museum, he can live as toy forever. But he chooses to live with Andy. One reason is of course he loves Andy, but there is another reason.

Toy Story 2 has more engagement-starved moments than Toy Story and the sole major improvement was to the animation, which is still as timeless as ever. I did love When She Loved Me, and I was about as morose as Jessie was when I heard that it lost the Best Original Song to You'll Be In My Heart from Tarzan. It gives Toy Story 2 an emotional edge over its predecessor, though I could not possibly care less about the assortment of inside jokes Pixar split across each frame, including Flik and Heimlich in the blooper reel and Geri as The Cleaner who repairs Woody. Some other references abound, too, but overall this is a film that is worth your time, a rarity for anything Disney (or Disney-related) slaps ""Sequel"" on to.

In this film, Woody will discover his own past of fame and prestige after being kidnapped by a collector of antique toys and put in contact with toys that are part of his own collection: his horse, an intrepid cowgirl called Jessie and a miner named Stinky Pete. Directed by John Lasseter, who continues his earlier work, the film retains most of the voice actors that were present in Toy Story.<br/><br/>Despite the bad reputation of sequels, this film managed to remain the level of its predecessor, developing to him a coherent sequence of events. This sense of continuity between them was achieved largely thanks to the maintenance of technical staff and initial voice actors. The novelty of this film, in fact, is the introduction of new characters, directly linked to the past of Woody (which the audience will discover along with himself), who will have a major role in the outcome of the film. The collecting is a matter intelligently placed in this film, allowing to reveal a little of what has been the history of the toys, from the fifties until today. Less interesting had the soundtrack, despite the appointment of ""When She Loved Me"" for the Oscar for Best Original Song. In fact, after the resounding success of the soundtrack of the first film with ""You've Got a Friend in Me"", also nominated for the statuette, it would be difficult to obtain similar impact.<br/><br/>For all these reasons, this movie deserves to be considered one of the best sequels of animated film and a great family film and deserves to be seen and reviewed by young and old."

So behind the smiles, i find that the movie lacks a bit of deepness and care : it wants to deliver a message about friendship but it looks like a blow by moment!

Al, who runs ""Al's Toy Barn"", recognizes Woody as a vintage toy he's sought after to complete a set. When the other toys see Woody taken, Buzz insists they form a rescue party and go after him.<br/><br/>Woody learns he's part of television and toy history. He meets the ""Roundup Gang""-Jessie, Woody's horse Bullseye and Stinky Pete the Prospector. Al intends to sell the set to a toy museum in Japan and he needs Woody to complete the set.<br/><br/>The rest of the movie has dual threads-following the gang as they try to find and rescue Woody and the plans to take the ""Roundup Gang"" to Japan. There are chase sequences, a sub-plot where Buzz winds up sidetracked and a different Buzz toy (who still labors under the delusion that this is real) goes with the other toys. New toys are encountered and Woody is rescued in the end.<br/><br/>High points are the introduction of ""Tour Guide Barbie"" at ""Al's Toy Barn"", the entrance of Zurg as the second, rather minor, villain as Buzz's nemesis and how the songs are used. Hearing Robert Goulet's voice coming from a toy penguin is worth the price of admission all by itself!<br/><br/>There are movies references and there's a wonderful cross-connection with the Pixar short, Geri's Game, which I loved. Just in case any of you haven't seen the film, I won't name the third villain, but I will say that, in true Toy Story fashion, the villains all have very appropriate payback for their behavior.<br/><br/>This film is available on Blu-Ray and DVD and is well worth watching. Most recommended."

","With the massive success of the first Toy Story, a sequel really had to deliver to not be forgotten and fortunately this was very much on par. I look at this movie as yet another brilliant part of a perfect trilogy in my eyes. In this installment, the gang are back and this time, Buzz will lead a rescue mission for Woody, who has been kidnapped by a man looking to get rich from Woody and his roundup collection. This film gets a little more visceral in some parts, as segments such as new toy Jessie's back story with a girl who ""abondened"" her and even Woody questioning his place with Andy after his arm is ripped. The fun, however, is still here and our favorite secondary characters are once again prone to give us the laughter we yearn from these movies. Toy Story 2 is yet another accomplished Pixar project and a great continuation of its most accomplished movie series. As far as I'm concerned, this movies are as awesome as movies can be.<br/><br/>Rating: 8,5-9/10"

","I still love the first toy story film more, but this one was just OK in my opinion. The plot is that a man finds woody at a yard sale when he woody was trying to rescue his squeaky penguin buddy. In the process he is accidentally pushed in a toolbox the man took. Woody finds out that he is a very valuable toy that came in a set of 3 others. He then meets a horse named bullseye, a guy named stinky Pete, and a cowgirl named Jessie. Meanwhile buzz and the gang are planning to rescue woody before he is shipped away for good. Woody learns more about himself and just how valuable he really is. Then things begin to take a bad turn. Woody and his new pals are stuck in a suitcase. Stinky Pete will not allow woody to leave and go back to Andy. The gang then defeats stinky Pete with cameras, but Jessie is stuck in the airplane. Woody and buzz decide to make a tough decision to rescue her. Finally in the end Jessie and bullseye decide to join the gang in their adventures. This film wasn't awful, but in my opinion not as good as the first one."
"sharky_55","10","0","1","24 July 2015"," Then again, the timespan of a childhood is not infinity
","Toy Story 2 opens with such a vivid and riveting intro sequence that its success was later replicated in a similar manner in Toy Story 3. It's at once more exciting than its predecessor and shows improvement in all areas, from the rousing opening track Zurg's planet which sets the adventurous tone (easily reminiscent of Williams' Star Wars), to the sound design of Buzz's rocket propelled flight through the impressive 3 dimensional rock field and fluid animation which showcases a whole new level of dynamism and camera movement in the characters. You can visualise the weight and care as Buzz balances himself on the floating platforms (playing a note each of Thus Spoke Zarathustra) or witness the motion blur of a back-flip. There's even a humorous note to it as Buzz pulls off that cool acrobatic and is immediately blown to smithereens - only then do we find out it was all the incompetence of Rex the Dinosaur playing a video game. Genius. It's such an achievement of Pixar, just 4 years after the first fully computer animated feature film, to showcase so must in so little runtime. <br/><br/>Toy Story was about cooler new toys taking the place of older treasured ones. Its sequel poses an even heavier question: what happens when kids eventually outgrow their toys? To be fair, it's not directly addressed until more than a decade later in Toy Story 3, but here Woody briefly considers the more eternal choice of being admired long after Andy has grown up, in a prestigious toy museum in Tokyo. It's such a humanising screenplay which gives some powerful motivation behind this decision; when Woody first finds out his historical and vintage value as a collector's item; his eyes light up and stare in amazement. Lasseter counters with another notion - priceless as he may be, locked up in a glass case he will never again wear the marks of playtime, only be admired at a distance. In the end Woody realises that his friends and Andy's happiness provide a more valuable sense of identity than just being a toy celebrity, but Lasseter doesn't make this a frivolous choice without any weight. Beyond the greedy and selfish Al there lies a very overlooked and artistic scene where Geri the Cleaner, of Geri's Game fame, lovingly repairs the years of damage Andy has inflicted. Geri, much like Andy or any other child, clearly cares about toys, although in a different way. Again it's a Pixar master-class; the sound design and animation work closely to show every intimate detail from the intricate reflection in the polished eyeballs, squirts of dye to colour his rosy cheeks, the slight shake of Geri's fingers and a tongue poked out in concentration, and of course the symbolic act of painting over the ANDY tag on the soles of his boots. It's all accompanied by one of Newman's more distinctive and playful themes. <br/><br/>Woody's predicament is contrasted by both Buzz and newcomer Jessie, tenderly voiced by Joan Cusack who provides two different sides of the abandoned cowgirl; one mournful, the other spunky. It's a heartbreaking montage in the middle of the film which spells this out, to the tune of When She Loved Me by Sarah McLachlan. She too, decides that time spent with each child is precious no matter who, and in some way mirrors the eventual transition in TS3. It mirrors the attitude of Prospector Pete, never having experienced a child's love, still in his original box, and harbouring resentment at space toys taking over the popularity of Western toys. He seeks adoration and will stop at nothing to get it. Buzz faces the opposite scenario of Woody; instead of being a collector's item, he is greeted with the display of hundreds upon thousands of identical toys just like himself, forcing him to reconsider his worth. There's wry humour to be gleaned here, when a rogue Buzz fresh out of the box takes his place in the gang (""Tell me I wasn't this deluded""). It's a credit to Tim Allen's voice acting to pull both personae off with such conviction. In the end, it's the ANDY on the soles of their feet that give them their worth, even for a fleeting moment in a child's life. <br/><br/>Beside Jessie there's a whole new range of characters that contribute to the humour and world of TS2. Who can forget Bullseye, the eager dog-like companion that despite never speaking a world, displays oodles of affection and playfulness? The catchphrase ""Run like the wind, Bullseye"" becomes an instant classic. What about the ever smiling and fast talking Barbie tour guide, verging on the edge of creepiness? Or Mrs Potatoe Head, the dutiful wife of Mr PH (who excels in the very entertaining credits, first introduced as a concept earlier in A Bug's Life)? Returning characters also get more screen-time and lines to work with. Who can forget the sly and charming Hamm (although I prefer 'Slotted Pig'), the loyal Slinky Dog, sassy Mr Potatoe Head (remarking ""That went well"" after the gang causes a major traffic accident crossing the street) or overly enthusiastic Rex, who's sole attention during the whole film is actually finding out how to defeat Zurg, the video game boss?<br/><br/>Toy Story 2 is one of those rare sequels that outshines its original in almost every way. It's technically impressive, it's voice cast is excellent and it's screenplay builds upon the predicament of the first and adds deeper, universal (well for toys at least) themes with emotional resonance. Perhaps it's the telling words of Wheezy the broken penguin that have the most significance; he points out that all toys are just one tear away from being sold off in a garage sale or donated. But that just makes each moment of play all the more precious."

","What can I say about this film that hasn't already been said? I watched this film when I was younger, and while I definitely enjoyed the first Toy Story installment, there was something about this one that made it far superior to me.<br/><br/>The characters we all know and love are back, this time facing a different dilemma: Woody being ""toy-napped"" as it were by an adult man who wishes to sell the complete set of toys from a show called ""Woody's Round-Up"" to a museum in Japan. We meet new characters who become so lovable that we almost forget that they're not in the original story (at least I did) As a little girl, I found that the addition of Jessie the Cowgirl was what I had missed in the first Toy Story. While there is Bo Peep, Woody's sweetheart, in the original, she was not a character I could relate to.<br/><br/>And then, lo and behold, there was Jessie: the a rough-and-tumble cowgirl doll who has a rather touching background story that you wouldn't expect first viewing the film.<br/><br/>For me, being a tomboy as a child, Jessie was my absolute favourite, and it still holds true to this day. I wanted a character in a film that was loud, brash and not afraid to state her opinions; a girl that I could relate to, even if that girl was just a plastic cowgirl doll. Getting older, I related more to her back-story: I too had been abandoned by those that I loved (friends, for example) and it made me reluctant to trust again.<br/><br/>Bullseye the horse is also a worthy addition to the series; he's so cute he's almost puppy-like in his behaviour. He's loyal to Woody and the gang, and so lovable I don't see how anyone - adult or child - could dislike him.<br/><br/>In short, Toy Story 2 is not only a worthy sequel to the first Toy Story, but also a good film in its own right."

","I think with the Toy Story movies, we have gotten to know the characters. The gang in Toy Story. We get to know them enough where they could be in a Toy Story TV show as we get to know them and their personalities. We seem to get to know the characters better in this film than any of the other Toy Story movies, and with a couple of characters added including Jessie and Bullseye that remain productive characters through the rest of the series. This movie is also one of the few sequels that does better than its predecessor and seems somewhat more popular. You can watch the movie and understand the feelings of the toys which is explained also in the 3rd movie. Yeah, kids play with Toys when they're young but normally stop playing with them when they're older. The Toy Story movies makes the toys we see come to life, and not in a creepy way or like the Velveteen Rabbit, but really seem like real characters with voices of actors we are familiar with. It's interesting how nobody ever really seems to suspect the toys are alive when they do a lot of things that people would have to notice. Somehow the toys can hide the fact that they're alive as seen in all 3 Toy Story movies.<br/><br/>If you watch this movie, I'm sure you'll be entertained, as I find these Toy Story movies about the most entertaining films in Pixar, and so far there have been 3 Toy Story movies. I thought I even saw one Halloween movie for Toy Story at Redbox this past Halloween. So, the characters really are characters we get to know and that entertain us. It looks like they're coming out with a Toy Story 4. I was kind of hoping for a Toy Story 4 after the 3rd one as I like the continuation of the series with these toys. I was wondering if they would, because I thought I heard earlier that they weren't going to have a new film, not having anywhere else they could go with the plot. Well, apparently they are doing a new film. It's interesting how these Toy Story movies date back to 1995 and they don't age. We can be making sequels from them years later with the same characters and they work for us.<br/><br/>Of all the Toy Story movies, I consider this one to be the funniest. I can really laugh when I see it, especially at the end with the outtakes. This is the only Toy Story movie I know of which has outtakes at the end. I know the first Toy Story didn't, I forget if the 3rd one did. But, seriously the outtakes at the end make this movie like twice as funny as it is during the end credits alone.<br/><br/>I'm sure most of you here reading this review have seen this movie. I'm also sure that if you've seen Toy Story and Toy Story 3, you've also seen Toy Story 2. This one might be my second favorite in the series. I feel like the plot in the first movie works the best, but I feel like this one is the funniest in the series. I feel like Toy Story 3 has a somewhat similar plot to this one. I wonder where they'll go in the next film. I guess we will see in 2 years. I give it a 10/10. It is that well done."

","Toy Story 2 is a 1999 American computer-animated comedy adventure film produced by Pixar Animation Studios. Directed by John Lasseter and co- directed by Lee Unkrich and Ash Brannon, it is the sequel to the 1995 film Toy Story.<br/><br/>Woody is stolen by a toy collector, prompting Buzz Lightyear and his friends to vow to rescue him. However, Woody finds the idea of immortality in a museum tempting. Many of the original characters and voices from Toy Story returned for this sequel, and several new characters, including Jessie (voiced by Joan Cusack), Barbie (voiced by Jodi Benson), and Mrs. Potato Head (voiced by Estelle Harris), were introduced.<br/><br/>Disney initially envisioned the film as a direct-to-video sequel. Toy Story 2 began production in a building separated from Pixar, on a small scale, as most of the main Pixar staff were busy working on A Bug's Life (1998). When story reels proved promising, Disney upgraded the film to theatrical release, but Pixar was unhappy with the film's quality. Lasseter and the story team redeveloped the entire plot in one weekend. Although most Pixar features take years to develop, the established release date could not be moved and the production schedule for Toy Story 2 was compressed into nine months.[3][4]<br/><br/>Despite production struggles, Toy Story 2 opened in November 1999 to wildly successful box office numbers, eventually grossing over $485 million, and highly positive critical reviews. Toy Story 2 has been considered by critics and audiences alike to be one of few sequels that outshine the original,[5] and it continues to be featured frequently on lists of the greatest animated films ever made. The film has seen multiple home media releases and a theatrical 3-D re-release in 2009, 10 years after its initial release. The film's success led to the production of Toy Story 3 in 2010, which was also highly successful."
"ElMaruecan82","9","0","1","15 May 2014"," Play with your toys, but not with their feelings ...
","The first ""Toy Story"" was on the same historical significance than ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"", it established the digital revolution that would change (literally) the face of animation, forever. This is perhaps why most of the praise was concentrated on the technological achievement, the 'toy' aspect rather than the 'story'. We were all moved by the endearing relationship between Andy and his cowboy doll Woody (Tom Hanks), immortalized in the 'You've got a friend in me' song, we also smiled at the little rivalry between Woody and Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen) turning with style into a touching friendship, and we all laughed at all the secondary characters populating this great adventure, from Mr. Potato Head (Don Rickles) to the cowardly dinosaur (Wallace Shawn) but nonetheless, we revered ""Toy Story"" for the amazing visual experience.<br/><br/>But in 1999, ""Toy Story"" was already part of history, and any similar movie would most likely be judged for its content. And being the sequel to a successful film wouldn't be enough to ensure its success or its reason to be released on the theaters. And this is where, in the case of ""Toy Story 2"", the writing makes all the difference. Indeed, after exploring the psychology of toys within their relationships with their owners, the second opus goes further in that existentialism by confronting the toys to both their future and past. The story starts when Woody is stolen by a guy working in a toy factory, panning to sell it to a toy collector in Japan, among other props from the same Western theme, including Bullseye, Woody's legendary horse, Jessie the Yodeling Cowgirl (Joan Cusack) and Stinky Pete, a Gold Prospector (Kelsey Grammar) still living in his package.<br/><br/>Like the best sequels, when you think no new character can steal the show, you have one that gets instantly stuck in your heart. Any viewer would see in Jessie, the premise of a predictable romance with Woody (well, there are some romantic vibes between the two toys) but there's more in Jessie to earn our sympathy: a wound from the past, the revelation that she too had her 'Andy' before the worst happened: she got old. Her melancholy is expressed through a touching song 'When She Loved Me"", and a sad nostalgic sequence showing a little girl playing with her cowboy doll, before her main interests would become make up, clothes, phones and (ugh!) boysÂ… I love that sequence, it is as deep and emotional as the unforgettable montage from ""Up"" and for once, it confronts teenage girls to their constant obsession to become women fast. If only because a 14-year old girl would think, ""why do I want to grow up?"" ""Toy Story 2"" accomplishes something great.<br/><br/>And there's more in that scene that induces this guilt, the rejection endured by toys, and the realization of Woody that the happiness he lives with Andy is only a matter of years, before hormones tickle his mind and make him think about girls. Then, Woody imagines that the eventuality of being owned by a toy collector is the only light of hope for such a dark fate, at one point, he is almost excited to know that he'll live with someone who'll value him forever. After all, wasn't he a big star who had his own Western TV show in the 50's? Why would he end up in a dump, a box of forgotten items or a dusty attic? What Woody doesn't know is that all his friends came to rescue him, lead by the real hero of the story: Buzz Lightyear. And in their perilous adventure, they discover where they come from: a toy factory, offering us a marvelous sequence whose highlights are a Tour Guide Barbie, and the magical moment when Buzz discovers the Buzz Lightyear shelves.<br/><br/>Basically, there are two parallel stories in ""Toy Story 2"". Woody discovers how valuable he became because he's getting rarer and unique, and Buzz sees how worthless he is, having so many replicas, outside Andy's house, he's not the center of the universe, and is easily replaceable. But both are wrong, because there's one thing, that puts them on the same level of worth, they have ANDY written in their feet and that's the difference, for one little kid, they are priceless. It might be temporary but the excitement is worth being lived, a toy is to be played with, not to be worshiped and valued, and that's the mistake collectors commit. I am just collecting old comic books (yeah, I'm a geek) but I don't think I ever find time to read them, so where is all the fun? Stinky Pete tries to convince Woody that he's wrong, but since he's the only toy not to have been played with, his reaction is explainable, we understand his bias.<br/><br/>But let's not spoil the rest of the story, because beyond all this existentialism, ""Toy Story"" is an extraordinary adventure movie, playing with the concept of toys evolving in the real world, including their own world, allowing them to solve personal issues. The film is amazing for children's eyes, and insightful for nostalgic adults, it's entertaining at best, and certainly one of the sequels that almost outshine the original, to the point I wondered why it wasn't Oscar-nominated for Best Animated Feature and Best Writing. Anyway I spent a great moment watching the film. And normally, I hate the bloopers during the end credits, even for comedies, but in that particular case, I'll make an exception. The ending was hilarious, a fitting (temporary) conclusion for one of the greatest animated film of the last 20 years, which is saying a lot."

","TOY STORY 2 represents the struggle of two different connections by the same person. Woody who has his family with all of Andy's toys and then there is the cast of toys from his old TV show. Along with being pulled in two different directions, there is also two different stories being told during the film. One being the journey of Buzz and the rest of Andy's gang trying to get to Woody and rescue him, and the other part is about Woody wanting to escape, but then realizing that he was a main part of a TV show that had all of this merchandise that was an expensive collectible. Woody was accidentally sold at a yard sale to this toy collector that has been searching for him to complete is set of the TV show. Once he is taken, the rest of Andy's toys led by Buzz, go after him to bring Woody back home. During the journey, they had several issues that came up, with one trying to the cross the road and also being caught in the toy store where they ran in to the entire group of Buzz light-years. This movie showed that there is no length to what friends would take to bring their friend back home where he belongs. Once Woody is with the rest of the TV show, he really feels like is a part of something special and that is what starts him to debate with himself if he wants to go back to Andy or if he should stay with Jessie and the rest of the TV characters. I enjoyed this movie very much and would be a movie that when it would be on, I would sit down and watch. It pulls you in and catches yourself pulling one way or another because both sides each have a good case as to why Woody should be with them. On one hand, he has Andy and the rest of the toys that have always been there for him just like he has for them. On the other hand, he has this group of toys that in their minds are nothing without Woody. In the end, he is able to join the groups minus the miner who was doing everything that he could to keep Woody there so they could be sold and treated well. Jessie and Bullseye go back with Woody and Buzz to become toys of Andy."

","I remember seeing this film in the cinema when I was 12 and I found it hilarious if moving in parts.<br/><br/>The animation has improved slightly over that in the first and I like the addition of new characters such as Jessie, Bullseye, Stinky Pete, Wheezy the Penguin, Zurg, Mrs Potato Head, Al and Barbie. I also like Andy's Dachsund Buster, who was briefly mentioned at the end of the first film. My favourite moments of this film include Jessie's poignant back-story about a girl called Emily who loved her and its accompanying song 'When She Loved Me,' Barbie giving a tour around the toy shop in the style of an open-top bus tour and the luggage conveyor belt sequence in the airport, which led to the funny moment of a little girl finding Stinky Pete in her backpack and calling him a ""big ugly man doll."" The out takes at the end were pant-wettingly funny, in fact I laughed so hard at them that I was on the verge of wetting myself. Also keep your eyes peeled for a cameo from Geri from 'Geri's Game' when he fixes Woody in preparation for his shipment to the museum...<br/><br/>All in all, this is a funny if heartbreaking addition to the 'Toy Story' franchise. 10/10."

","Pixar Animation Studios has always made great films. But as far as these movies go, there have been five that were just superb and basically flawless.

It didn't just re-hash Toy Story, it expanded upon the story that was already there in the first movie.

","Toy Story 2, much like the original, is simply said, an all time classic! There really isn't much to criticize with this film as most of its elements work really well together.<br/><br/>John Lassester was back for the direction of Toy Story 2, and whilst he was there, it was pretty safe to believe that he would get it right a second time. Tom Hanks and Tim Allen playing Woody and Buzz respectively were as fine as they could ever be and John Cusack playing the new character Jessie was fantastic. <br/><br/>The story is quite similar to its original but with plenty of variety and originality. In the original, Woody and Buzz had to use each other in dire situations to come on top but here Buzz leads a rescue team to save Woody from the toy stealer, the owner of Al's shop. <br/><br/>Now, I liked this movie for several reasons. <br/><br/>1) It made me laugh more than the first 2) The new characters in the film were exciting 3) It was great to see Mrs Potato Head and the puppy who were the newest of Andy's toys at the end of the first film<br/><br/>I thought the writing for this movie was intelligent. I also thought that the direction of John Lassester was just fantastic as he knew not to spend too long without much plot movement. In fact, pretty much every scene had relevance to the story. Only great direction can do that. Also when introducing female characters, it can normally be extremely annoying but not in this circumstance! It was all brilliantly done! <br/><br/>The voice acting, like I said, is better than ever and the story is extremely entertaining. Half way during the movie, I wasn't sure this movie was to be a success as I hadn't seem it in a long ,long long time but I was thankful that it was superbly concluded. <br/><br/>During Pixar's Golden Age, Toy Story 2 is placed as one of their finest films and a joy for adults and children to watch"

","After the success of their first movie together, Disney/Pixar went ahead to make many more movies together, but soon they returned to the movie that started it all, Toy Story, but Disney's initial plan was for Toy Story 2 to be a home video, but upon reading the script and seeing the reels they noticed the possibilities of another blockbuster lurks, so Disney pumped money into it, recalled the voice cast and Toy Story 2 was made, a wonderful additional to its 1995 original.<br/><br/>Toy Story 2, picks up from where the last one stopped, and it didn't neglect to let us know that Andy himself is getting older; the puppy and the Mrs Potatoe Head toy mentioned at the end of the first film are also featured in this movie, their addition to the clan, was so well done that you will not feel like they were crowding. Then the adventure in this movie is not a Woody trying to clear himself, it is a save woody adventure. The movie's directing is just as good as the first, the score not so great but it is negligible and the CGI is upgraded.<br/><br/>The movie plot sees Woody (Tom Hanks) get stolen by a collector, the other toys noticed this theft and with Buzz (Tim Allen) hell bend to save Woody, recruited some other toys: Rex, Mr Potatoe Head, Slinky Dog and Hamm the piggy bank on a journey to go save Woody from his captor.<br/><br/>The crew that went to save Woody made the movie for me; their addition took the scope away from what the first movie was all about, Woody and Buzz. This movie too is about Woody but now some other toys too are involved in this outside rescue.<br/><br/>The idea for a sequel was being put together after the release of the first, but production faced a lot of hiccups on the way mostly due to Disney's set release date of the film costing Pixar to work at a fast pace to meet the set release date. The movie story had a lot of recycled ideas that were in the draft of the first film, which were discarded. This ideas included but not limited to, the obsessive toy collector, who here in this movie is the main antagonist (Sid Philips, Andy's former neighbor before they moved was the first movie's antagonist).<br/><br/>Upon its release Toy Story 2 cost 90 million dollars to make and it recruited over 480 million from the box office making it a commercial success.

","Toy Story 2 is a terrific movie with a very well developed plot and a stellar voice cast. It's a very impressive sequel that stands out on its own and does not try to mimic the original in any way. It has its own original story, there a plenty of new characters who are a delightful additions to the series, such as the hyper Jessie, the wacky horse Bullseye, and the very layered Stinky Pete. <br/><br/>The film has a lot more heart than the original. There are some real tear jerking moments, such as Jessie's daydream about her time with her first owner. There is an ongoing theme throughout in which Woody comes to terms with the fact that Andy is growing up and that he probably does not have much time left with him. It is hard hitting and adds so much more to the character. <br/><br/>The cast is all around fantastic, returning cast members shine, such as Tom Hanks as Woody and Tim Allen as Buzz Lightyear. New additions are also terrific, Joan Cusack is very energetic as Jessie and Kelsey Grammar classes up the joint as Pete. <br/><br/>It is one of the freshest sequels out there, just as good, if not better, than the first. Sweet, funny and heartwarming, Toy Story 2 is a delight for the whole family. <br/><br/>Woody is kidnapped by a toy store owner, so Buzz and the gang set out to save him.

","Directed by John Lasseter, Ash Brannon. With the voices of Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, Joan Cusack, Kelsey Grammar.

What may have surprised many was that it is every bit as good as the first film, even going a bit darker in the theme department, making it a precursor of Pixar movies to come later down the line. Pixar understand<br/><br/>That a golden rule of a good sequel is to not only jack up the action, but also to expand the characters at the same time, and they do this in spades. There's more chases, clashes and all round malarkey, the effects imagery is obviously better four years down the line, while the toy town take on certain other blockbuster movies rewards the film fan considerably. The grim thematics of mortality and abandonment are brilliantly written into the plot, with some of the character interactions worthy of bigger budgeted highbrow dramas, and the set pieces are terrifically mounted, especially for the thrilling last quarter.<br/><br/>It was a tough act to follow, but the Pixar crew have done everything one can reasonably expect with Toy Story 2.

","Toy Story 2 is a 1999 computer-animated film and sequel to the 1995 groundbreaking blockbuster hit ""Toy Story,"" released by Walt Disney Pictures and Pixar Animation Studios (now Disney/Pixar). This was Pixar's third full-length computer-animated film and after the successes of ""Toy Story"" and ""A Bugs Life,"" Toy Story 2 was expected to do the same. And it did, becoming the second highest-grossing film of '99 (behind the much anticipated ""Star Wars Episode 1: The Phantom Menace"")!!! In this sequel, Woody (voice of Tom Hanks), Buzz Lightyear (voice of Tim Allen), Rex (voice of Wallace Shawn), Slinky (voiced by the late Jim Varney), and the rest of the gang are back!!! This time, our heroes face an even greater challenge!! When Andy (voice of John Morris) goes off to summer camp, Woody becomes the subject of interest for greedy toy collector Al (voice of Wayne Knight), owner of the local toy store. Once he sets his sights on Woody, he begins to think of a plan that will make him rich. After Woody is kidnapped, Buzz and the gang devise a daring plan to rescue him. When Woody arrives at Al's place, he meets some new toys including Jessie the Yodelin' Cowgirl (voice of Joan Cusack), Bullseye the Horse (voice of Frank Welker), and Stinky Pete the Old Prospector (voice of Kelsey Grammar), all of whom starred on an old show called ""Woody's Roundup"" with him back in the day. Can Buzz and the gang rescue Woody in time? Like I said in the title, this sequel is just as good as the original! It has great animation, great story, great new characters, and a memorable song (""When She Loved Me"" almost had me shed a tear when I first saw this). This is truly the greatest film trilogy in animation history!!! Rating: 10/10!!!"
"drqshadow-reviews","9","0","1","26 April 2012"," Weakest of the Trilogy, It's Still a Roaring Success
","In a lot of ways, sequels reveal more about the strength of the original than any amount of repeated viewings. Without the requisite introductions, meet-and-greet and initial character developments, the strength of the core cast is stripped bare. They're left to prove their worth in the great wide open, and what successes or failures they find can be a great judge of their quality. In Toy Story's case, Woody and Buzz's second adventure is definitive proof of what a deep, colorful yarn Pixar had actually sewn in their first feature-length effort. The troupe doesn't even stop for a breath as they plunge right into topics that range from emotional attachment and the importance of a family unit to isolation and abandonment. Of course, such weighty subjects aren't addressed pointedly; instead they're gracefully interwoven into the backdrop of a bright, rousing Incredible Journey-styled venture through the city in search of an important stolen toy. Stuffed with throwbacks that are sure to elicit cheery memories of the first picture, it's also loaded up with new material that's every bit as charming. Though I wouldn't quite put it on the same level as the original, and I felt that the messages of the recent third chapter are more poignant, it still sits near the top of Pixar's portfolio."

"toll-8","8","0","1","24 November 2011"," Not as good as the first but still great!! Another Buzz Lightyear to the rescue
","The original Toy Story set a new level, one that you would struggle to beat. The sequel although not beating it does remain close to that mark and doesn't fail to impress. This one has moved forward in the sense of the animation, with the effects being even more impressive and although the story isn't quite as good it still manages to take us on an exhilarating journey.<br/><br/>This sequel starts with all the toys playing happy families. They still get up to their usual tricks when Andy is out the room and still manage to replace themselves just as he comes in. Woody is anxious at the start, struggling to find his hat, the one missing piece of his outfit ready to accompany Andy to Cowboy Camp. They find the hat and Woody is relieved to be able to go but when Andy decides to have a five minute play before he heads off he accidentally rips Woody's arm meaning Woody will have to stay behind after all and up on the highest shelf ready for repair.<br/><br/>Woody's second problem is when Andy's mother has a lawn sale in his absence and poor Wheezy (a squeaking penguin) is placed out in the yard. Woody being an all action hero uses the dog to transport him to the sale and save his friend, however a toy collector spots him and steals him, knowing it will complete his collection and earn him big money. It turns out Woody is part of a collection known as the Round-Up Gang. The collection have been locked away in storage for years waiting for Woody to be found and now he has they are all set to be jetted off to Japan and be looked at through a glass box for the rest of their lives. Woody, at first, is reluctant but upon getting to know Jessie the Cowgirl, Bullseye the horse and Stinky Pete the Prospector he falsely believes that he is more part of something here than at Andy's as Andy will eventually grow up. This scene is shown in a heart moving song from Jessie's point of view another great piece from Randy Newman although he doesn't perform.<br/><br/>Buzz and the gang decide to rescue their faithful leader and head off into the wilderness, known as the real world, in search of him. Buzz, Slinky, Mr Potato Head, Hamm and Rex however all encounter their own problems, like meeting another Buzz in a toy shop who they mistake for their Buzz (he performs very much like when Buzz was introduced into the first film) a busy intersection crossing in which they must cross using traffic cones (a brilliant sequence) an aisle of Barbie dolls who each toy can't get enough of and Buzz's long lost enemy, Zurg. All obstacles on the quest to find Woody and to do all the things he has done for them in the first film.<br/><br/>The film doesn't surpass the original but at times it definitely matches it. Some of the humour is top class, with the other Buzz providing a lot of laughs especially with our Buzz's reactions to him. It is like watching Buzz and Woody's initial meet in the first one. The chemistry between the other toys on their journey is also well written with each character being very three-dimensional. <br/><br/>The same however can't be said for the Round-Up Gang where I found myself less interested in their story than I was with Buzz and the gang's journey. This is where the film lacks compared to the original as only half the story is engaging and we would rather see Buzz's problems than Woody's. The Round –Up Gang aren't as fun with Jessie becoming annoying and Stinky Pete having a sudden turn. Bullseye is also very 'Looney Tune' and although I didn't mind this others will. Unfortunately these are the few problems with the film which don't let it reach the heights of the original. Also the climax seemed to be over far too quickly and seemed far sillier than what it should have been. I understand that the whole concept is unbelievable but an unbelievable concept can be made real but when a stuffed horse is running at the same speed as a plane I was thinking this is getting a little bit too silly now. I can draw the line at five of them driving a car.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong the film is great and I found myself laughing at so many points, especially the Buzz vs. Buzz scenes, they are great. There are also references to the first film and to other films that you will find yourself enjoying pointing out. Despite my slight issues with the film it is still a worthy addition for Pixar and for the Toy Story franchise. It doesn't quite reach the heights of the original but let's be honest not many animated films ever will."

","When Woody is stolen by a toy collector, Buzz and his friends vow to rescue him, but Woody finds the idea of immortality in a museum tempting.<br/><br/>You can consider me a huge fan of the original Toy Story. Pixar made a home run with that film, bringing elements for both adults and children to enjoy. But 4 years later, Pixar comes back with a sequel, that will seriously convince you otherwise. Toy Story 2 is five-million times better than Toy Story, no exaggeration. And that is still calling the original an amazing film. This one combines action, adventure, and best of all: heart. Some of the scenes will form tears in your eyes. Woody's decision whether to stay or go. Jesse's flashback about being abandoned. Like another reviewer has stated, this is not just a kid's movie. It combines everything that'll satisfy everyone's needs of movie entertainment. Of course, there is still those mild childish moments. But keep in mind that Toy Story IS a children's film and not made just for adults. Aside, I can think of no other complaints of this film. Everything is just done perfectly! In fact, Toy Story 2 cannot be topped from Toy Story 3, but who knows? If you enjoyed Toy Story, you'll love the sequel. (Who knew sequels could be better than the original?) If you were not so sure of Toy Story, who knows, you might end up loving this one. With the original mostly taking place in Andy's house or Sid's, this one takes the adventure everywhere possible! A toy store, an apartment, an airport, and everything you can think of. The animation really has topped the predecessor, succeeding in anyway possible! Now you can just maybe read the character's lips, foreshadowing future animation. The voice acting (yes, again defeating the original) is more styled and fun. The plot, yes, is bigger and badder and faces all sorts of problems. In fact, this film is a childhood dream; almost perfect. The film touches anything you can think of and even including fun! I enjoyed this one far better than the first, but we'll see what the third has in store. Toy Story 2 will always be a memory for me nevertheless. 10/10."
"jwatetowahhigh","10","0","1","18 October 2011"," Better than the first one
","This sequel really surprised me, even being as young as I was when it came out in theaters, at how fun, vibrant, and new it turned out to be. Not only is it as good as it's 1995 predecessor, it is far better in many aspects. For one thing, there is more development out of all the characters in Andy's room rather than just Woody and Buzz along with the addition of Jessie, bullseye, and Stinky Pete, Woody's Roundup gang who kept the comedy going the entire time. The animation is also far more realistic, notably in the airport and elevator scenes it looks like real life with no special glasses required. The message is more melancholy than the first, but just one you want to shake your head at and go ""True, true"" like the old Budweiser commercial. After Toy Story 3 came out, the ending to this one is a spine chiller, as it began an 11-year wait for the conclusion to these toys adventures with Andy that may not have wanted to be discovered by fans after the great time this movie provided. 10/10 Neck and neck with it's successor as the best in the series."
"djansen24","9","0","1","8 September 2011"," Takes the greatness of the first and expands on it
","How Pixar managed to connect with its audience in Toy Story 1 is repeated here and expanded upon. Toy Story 1 was a great picture, but this one actually eclipses it in scope. The examining of people's relationship with their toys (and the guilt they have upon growing too old for them) is fully developed and given weight. That results in a slightly dark tone to the picture, but a necessary one for the story. This gets played out even further, but to less effect in Toy Story 3. Pixar balances on a very thin tight rope here. Make it too playful and action packed, and the human element is lost. Make it too introspective, and the film becomes sorrowful. But combine the elements just right, and you get...magic! Most sequels suffer from not having the shock of the new. This is not the case here. Not only does the depth and emotional tug of the story grip us, but we are actually happy to be back ""playing with"" Woody and the gang. It's like seeing old friends again and meeting new ones. As always, Pixar proves it is a master of direction, animation, humor, and warmth, but it ups the ante making this a near masterpiece. Finding Nemo amazingly enough would even outdo this picture. Another great movie from a studio that can do almost no wrong!"

","A lot of people say that Toy Story 2 is a sequel that is better than the original. Well, the first Toy Story is my favorite animated movie of all time, so of course I have to disagree. But that doesn't stop the fact that this is still an amazing movie.<br/><br/>Like the first, the animation is fantastic, even better this time. The old characters are engaging, and it's funny as heck. New characters are added this time, such as Jessie, the yodeling cowgirl, who I thought was a little annoying in the beginning, but began to really like as the film went on. Bullseye, a horse who make so much emotion with his eyes and mouth. The Prospector, who acts sort of like a father figure to Woody, and Barbie, who is so sweet it's almost sickening, but man is she fun.<br/><br/>There are a lot more villains in this film, the main one is Al, who flat out steals Woody. Zurg, Buzz Lightyear's arch enemy, some might say that the second Buzz is another villain, and there's even a surprise villain, who I won't give away.<br/><br/>The movie deals with a lot more adult themes, such as growing up. Woody begins to wonder what will happen to him when Andy grows up and doesn't play with him anymore.<br/><br/>The plot is so jam packed that I won't go into it, over all, it's still an excellent movie, but I still like the first one more, even if this one may be better in it's story."

","This was the movie that I loved as a child I'd watch this and want my own toys to come to life. This is just a sequel to a perfect trilogy and it is my second favorite of them. This one introduced the toys going out on a epic adventure way outside the home and it just gets better with villain toys and heart felt scene with abandonment.<br/><br/>So this movie starts with Woody getting broken and he gets mixed up in a garage sale and basically gets stolen by some fat guy. Now the rest of the toys say we need to go save Woody and they go on a rescue mission. This story is just a epic adventure and you get to see where Woody is from which is always cool. My favorite toy is Zurg not in the sense of lines or importance actually they do kind of a stupid joke with his character but I like to see the the toys that are based on villains are actually evil that is something I wanted to see from these movies more evil toys but thats me.<br/><br/>The voice acting we all know who does the voices so I won't name any but those guys are great thats really all that needs to be said.<br/><br/>Overall if you like Toy Story like me well you've already seen it but buy it for the kids introduce them to this trilogy this movie and the prequel and sequel are classics in the animated movies. So I give this a buy for you and the kids."

Although I really enjoyed watching the true heart of these movies, and seeing the return of our friends, learning a new secret to the Woody character, and even enjoying the new characters, I felt that this type of Toy Story movie kind of separated the true meaning of the series, and it kind of felt like something was missing from this Toy Story sequel. I felt that there was a strong heart to this movie about letting go when getting older. But I don't really think they used that much of that particular message to make the movie more heartwarming. I still enjoyed that mishap, though! The characters are still memorable, and they still know how to make us laughs. Even our new characters light up the screen, so it was really nice watching newer and brighter characters join the group.

"hall895","8","0","1","26 February 2011"," The grand toy adventure
","The original Toy Story played out mostly in Andy's room and his neighbor's house. It was a great story but one that felt a little confined, quick excursion to Pizza Planet notwithstanding. Toy Story 2 opens up the toy world, providing room for a great, grand adventure. This story can go anywhere and that creates opportunity for great visuals, great laughs and great, big action. Big action in an animated movie about toys? Yes indeed. What happens when a group of toys tries to cross the road? Mayhem. Beautiful, hilarious mayhem.<br/><br/>All our favorite toys from the first movie are back for Toy Story 2. This time the story focuses largely on Woody, who discovers that he is a prized collectible, the star of an old, popular TV puppet show. He finds that he is actually part of a set of toys. There's Jessie the Yodeling Cowgirl, Stinky Pete the Prospector and Bullseye, Woody's horse. This is all very exciting for Woody. Or it would be if not for how it is he came to discover all this about himself. Woody was kidnapped by greedy toy collector Al who plans to sell Woody and the rest of his gang to a toy museum in Japan. How can Woody get back to Andy? Well, duh. Buzz Lightyear to the rescue! Buzz leads a daring, perilous crosstown rescue mission. There will be many obstacles along the way. And the biggest foe for Buzz Lightyear will be...Buzz Lightyear! What a twisted, funny toy world we live in.<br/><br/>If there is any complaint at all with Toy Story 2 it would be that Woody and Buzz are largely kept apart. The chemistry and interplay between these two characters gave the first movie much of its charm and there's a sense this movie misses that a little bit. But there are more than enough good things here to make the sequel a clear success. First off, the film looks spectacular. For as great an achievement in animation as the first Toy Story was the sequel takes it to another level. There are some truly breathtaking visuals here. The story is compelling, with plenty of room for both humor and drama. And some real poignancy too. All the voice actors do a great job bringing their toys to life. Tom Hanks and Tim Allen are the big stars but every performer plays his or her part perfectly. All the old favorites from the first movie are back and there are some great new additions too. Joan Cusack is a wildly enthusiastic Jessie. Jodi Benson provides plenty of laughs in playing Barbie. Stinky Pete seems to have a lot of Sideshow Bob in him. And there is room for a human or two in this toy world, Wayne Knight as Al the Toy Collector making for a great villain. Kids will surely love the movie but adults will too. Plenty of sly references and lots of subtle humor that may have the parents chuckling while their children wonder what's so funny. All in all Toy Story 2 is the rare sequel which does not disappoint, a clearly worthy successor to the original movie which was so beloved."

","Toy Story 2 is another masterpiece by Pixar. I haven't seen a Pixar movie that I haven't yet enjoyed. This is also the first Pixar sequel and boy is it good. The animation and music are beautiful. The score/songs by Newman are fantastic and I'm sure the song by Sarah McLachlan will choke a few people up.<br/><br/>This movie is about how Woody is stolen by a greedy store owner and his plans to sell him at a Japanese toy auction. However Buzz and the gang won't let that happen.<br/><br/>The voice acting is amazing. Hanks and Allen of course were great. I can't see how Joan Cusack was annoying though.<br/><br/>I loved all the new characters introduced especially Jesse the cowgirl. In fact her scene where she gets left behind from her owner is tear-jerking and my favorite.<br/><br/>Overall, this is one of the best animated features ever. I rate this film 10/10."

","The sequel to the insanely popular Toy Story (1995) is a blast. John Lasseter and co-directors Ash Brannon and Lee Unkrich give viewers another ninety minutes of family entertainment of the highest order. There are more reasons to cheer as Toy Story 2 packs more action and adventure, more toys, and more references to cinematic folklore than its prequel. And it does so without compromising on the human story of friendship and loyalty.<br/><br/>Woody and Buzz Lightyear return as best buddies and find themselves in more trouble than ever. Woody is stolen by a bumbling toy collector who intends to sell him to a client in Japan to make loads of money. He is the final and most valuable piece of the Round' Up gang, a rare collection of toys that were very popular with kids back when humans had yet to land on the moon. Buzz and the other toys set out to attempt a near impossible rescue before Andy, their owner, comes back from a camp.<br/><br/>The primary reason Toy Story 2 is a more enjoyable flick than its prequel (but not necessarily better) is that the ""other toys"" get to directly experience the peril of the ""outside world"". And to absolutely hilarious effect, if I may add. Mr. Potato Head, Rex, Slinky Dog, and Hamm join Buzz as they find themselves racing against time and avoiding danger posed by humans and ""evil toys"" such as Stinky Pete and Zurg, Buzz's nemesis.<br/><br/>Toy Story 2 is not without its heart-tugging moments. In a sequence accompanied by the touching song ""When She Loved Me"", Jessie, one of the film's new characters, recollects memories of a distant past when she was the proud toy of a young girl who loved her, but grew up and discarded her. Cinematic references to Spielberg's Jurassic Park (1993), Hitchcock's Rear Window (1954), and not to forget Kershner's The Empire Strikes Back (1980) are also nicely weaved into the screenplay.<br/><br/>Both Toy Story films can be enjoyed on their own without the need to watch them together. This is a strong testament to the quality of filmmaking by Pixar. Technically, Toy Story 2 is much more sophisticated. Even with the advancement of computer wizardry and technology (and it being a sequel), the film is still able to match its predecessor's warmth and earnestness. Simply put, Pixar keeps raising the bar for animation with each new feature.<br/><br/>But the real test awaits. After more than a decade, Toy Story 3 (2010) is slated for release in a month's time. Will it be a nostalgic return to our childhood? Or will we find out that we have outgrown Woody and Buzz? Pixar's ultimate challenge then is to convince us, in ninety minutes, that we have been frozen in carbonite all these years, that we haven't really aged at all.<br/><br/>GRADE: A (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) All rights reserved."

","One of the best-reviewed sequels of all time, TOY STORY 2 continues the tale of the toys from Andy's room, adding a few characters, upping the chase ante and breaking our hearts with animated toys that are better actors than people.<br/><br/>Cowboy Woody (voice of Tom Hanks) is stolen by Al the toy collector (Wayne Knight, still playing a blubbering fat guy - even as a cartoon!). Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen) mounts a rescue mission with some of the other toys to get him back. But Woody may not want to return...<br/><br/>Woody turns out to be a collector's item, completing Woody's Roundup Gang, comprising Jessie the Cowgirl (Joan Cusack), Stinky Pete the Prospector (Kelsey Grammar) and Woody's trusty steed, Bullseye; all awaiting shipment to a museum in Japan, making big bucks for Al.<br/><br/>All the principals return to voice their now beloved toys: Don Rickles as cantankerous Mr. Potato Head, Jim Varney as pragmatic Slinky Dog, Wallace Shawn as twitchy Rex Dinosaur, John Ratzenberger as impatient Hamm the Piggy Bank. And the three little green aliens find a new god in Mr. Potato Head and make ""oooo"" sounds at him.<br/><br/>In their quest, the toys enter Al's toy store and separate, searching for Woody. They meet Tour Guide Barbie, who joins their quest, while Buzz's nemesis, the Evil Emperor Zurg, stalks them, and is involved in the funniest STAR WARS joke since George Lucas cast Hayden Christensen as Darth Vader.<br/><br/>It's ironic that the TOY STORY movies are the best feature film work of Tim Allen's career, as he imbues Buzz with such vibrant personality and imbues his human roles with the personality of a puppet.<br/><br/>Buzz runs across a whole aisle of Buzz Lightyear action figures and is entrapped by one inculcated with the Space Ranger/George W. Bush credo of Imprison First with no Habeas Corpus. The ""fake"" Buzz then joins our toy friends without their knowledge, thereafter calling each toy by their obvious design: ""Lizard Man"" for Rex and ""Vegetable Man"" for Mr. Potato Head; Hamm asks, ""Where'd you get the cool belt, Buzz?"" ""Well, Slotted Pig, they're standard issue."" <br/><br/>Meanwhile, Al calls in a Cleaner on Woody. This sequence is remarkable, accompanied by mind-bending mood music, as the old cleaner polishes, stitches and refurbishes Woody, which is a good thing, but which ultimately removes his identity as Andy's plaything. The music is reminiscent of the best cute, magical, yet ominous themes from the Disney archives, before Disney Corp became too sanctimonious to bear.<br/><br/>Like the original TOY STORY (1995), Pixar Studios and the genius writers-directors (John Lasseter, Ash Brannon, Lee Unkrich among others) somehow find a way to break off a piece of our hearts, as Jessie recounts the tale of her little girl owner growing up and abandoning her for interests in ponies and boys, all to the strains of Sarah McLoughlin's melancholy, nostalgic When She Loved Me. It takes us back to our own childhoods and forgotten toys and carefree feelings and young friends now grown old like ourselves. ""You never forget kids like Emily or Andy, but they forget you."" Every 40-year-old man becomes a blubbering baby. It's embarrassing.<br/><br/>The big question on all our minds: does Woody break off his namesake in Jessie the Cowgirl, who's a loud, raucous, game lass when it comes to tickling him and enticing him to stay with the Roundup Gang (with Filthy Pete - I mean, Stinky Pete watching out of the corner of his box)? But no - Jessie actually makes puppet eyes at Buzz in the end, leaving Woody to oil his guns on Bo Peep's bloomers.<br/><br/>When Woody faces the dilemma of choosing between being a star in Japan or returning to Andy who will one day forget him, Buzz turns the tables on him, and in a mirror image of TOY STORY, Buzz emphatically chides Woody, ""You - are - a toy!"" <br/><br/>Now tell that to us weeping 40-year-olds."
"Michael_Elliott","Null","0","2","22 December 2010"," Good Sequel
","Toy Story 2 (1999) <br/><br/>*** (out of 4) <br/><br/>Nice sequel to the 1995 smash hit has Woody getting stolen by a toy collector who plans to sell him to a museum in Japan. Buzz, Mr. Potato Head, Hamm and Slinky Dog decide to go and try to rescue him but Woody gets some pressure from his other collectibles that it might be best to start a new life elsewhere. It seems many fans consider this one a lot better than the first but I wouldn't go that far. While this is still an impressive little gem I do think it falls a tad bit short of the first film for a couple reasons. The majority of this film centers in on Woody, Buzz, the rescuers and of course the new toys who want Woody to stay with them so that they can be sold off as a complete set. The group goes on several adventures while the majority of the other toys from the first film are at home and off the screen. I think this is one of the problems with this film because many memorable characters simply aren't in this film and to me that is a letdown. The first movie had one great joke and adventure after another and a truly remarkable imagination. It's fair to say that this film has that same imagination but just not as wide as the previous movie since it did feature more characters. With that said, this is still a charming little film thanks in large part to the voice work of Tom Hanks and Tim Allen. They certainly have no trouble getting back into their roles and the same is true for Don Rickles, Joan Cusack and the underrated Jim Varney. We even get Kelsey Grammar as a rather unfriendly part of Woody's collection. The Big Al character by Wayne Knight is one of the new folks that I actually enjoyed as I thought he summed up that obsessive collector quite nicely but at the same time he can't hold a candle to the mean kid from the first. The adventure that the group sets out on is pretty funny and the highlight is a terrific sequence where they're trying to cross a busy road when all mayhem breaks loose. The final ride through the airport is another nice sequence and as you'd expect the animation is terrific. TOY STORY 2 is certainly a good movie and one well worth watching but at the same time I think it falls well short of the first film."
"Doylenf","7","0","1","19 December 2010"," Solid proof that sequels are not always inferior...
","TOY STORY 2 expands on the originality of the first ""Toy Story"" by turning the plot into a rescue mission that must be performed by several of the main character toys led, of course, by Woody and Buzz Lightyear.<br/><br/>Once again, the voices perfectly match the characters, the special effects are brilliant, the script matches the clever aspects of the original, and the story actually has a lot more scope with more of a feel for the dramatic and dangerous world of airports, stolen goods, elevator shafts, street traffic and all sorts of predicaments that combine laughter with terror.<br/><br/>TOM HANKS and TIM ALLEN are back as the voices for Woody and Buzz, as are many others from the original cast. A nice new addition is Stinky Pete the Prospector, who also happens to be one of the best animated and most interesting of all the computer-generated figures. There's also a Mrs. Potato and a Cowgirl mate for our hero.<br/><br/>All of the technical aspects mark an improvement over the original and the quality of the script and story is just as good, marking one of the few times that a sequel more than matches the inspiration of the first film."
"brando647","9","0","1","9 December 2010"," TOY STORY 2 Even Better Than the First
","Pixar raised the standard for feature film animation with their wildly successful TOY STORY in 1995. It was a fun adventure for the kids that was so well done that adults could enjoy it with them. Sequels are notorious for failing to live up to the original (with obvious exceptions) and TOY STORY 2 could've easily ended up as a direct-to-DVD throwaway in an attempt to cash in on the success of the original. Instead, I felt it surpassed the quality of the first and brought even more to the table. The film follows Woody as the begins to sink in that toys don't last forever. His arm is torn and Woody is shelved, a seeming death sentence for toys. In an attempt to rescue a fellow broken toy from being sold at a yard sale, Woody is stolen by an obsessed collector who wishes to complete his ""Woody's Round-Up"" collection for sale to a Japanese museum. Upon arriving at the collector's apartment, Woody meets the other members of his round-up gang (Jessie, his loyal horse Bullseye, and Stinky Pete the Prospector) and it's revealed that Woody is actually a collector's item spawned from a popular kid's television show of the 50s. As Buzz Lightyear assembles the rest of Andy's toys to mount a rescue operation, Woody must make a decision: immortal glory as part of a museum exhibit or the temporary love of his owner Andy.<br/><br/>All of our favorite toys from the first film return with the original voice cast, with a few new additions. Estelle Harris (George Costanza's mom on SEINFELD) is Mrs. Potato Head and Joan Cusack is Jessie; both have some hilarious moments and fit right in with the originals. While Woody and Buzz are the stars, my favorite characters have always been the supporting players: Mr. Potato Head (Don Rickles), Hamm (John Ratzenberger), Slinky Dog (Jim Varney), and Rex (Wallace Shawn). We get plenty of them as they accompany Buzz on the mission and their romp through a toy store is just great. Despite the awesomeness of the toy cast, one of my favorite characters is toy collector Al (Wayne Knight). Knight is great as the spastic money-grubbing baddie who's finally gotten the final piece to his cash cow.<br/><br/>The movie felt more action-oriented than the first. The first TOY STORY had its moments but this film ups the ante with the toys crossing a dangerously busy four-lane road, a twisting chase through a cavernous airline baggage sorter, and an eventual chase over the tarmac to reach a plane. While it is a kid's movie by nature, it's still a fun movie to people of any age thanks to the characters and a universal love of our childhood playthings. The story was well written and Woody's dilemma over his mortality as a toy is an interesting followup to Buzz's moment of depressing recognition that he was indeed just a toy in the first film. Overall, a great family film and easy to recommend to anyone."

Classic. The only gripe I have with this film and its sequel but especially this one since he has more screen time is Bullseye, the dog/horse lame toy. The reason I dislike this character is that the films already have that position filled with a more likable Slinky and even Buster because he is a real dog, there is no reason to include Bullseye."

"johnnyboyz","7","0","1","19 July 2010"," Branching out and upping the ante in comparison to the first, but pulling it off with a certain charm.
","There's little doubt Toy Story 2 attempts to go above the 1995 original; a sort of betraying of the first one's rules in keeping the realism of these toys coming alive and interacting with their surroundings for sake of greater escapades and larger adventures. In short, it works; but realising how absurd the film may have turned out and noting how grounded and enjoyable it turns out in actuality, is the true pleasure. In conforming to whatever written rule or code of conduct the toys seemingly had in the first film, in relation to keeping the magic of their life a secret from human beings, the first maintained a wondrously consistent close knit sense that avoiding all manner of extravagant activity was a good thing; rendering the finale with Syd in which the code is broken all the more dramatic and involving. Toy Story 2 sees the toys commit grand theft auto; cause a motorway pile up and execute all manner of expansive activity in airports, on runways and other such public places without much trouble - all whilst seemingly going unnoticed. But it is to the film's great credit we become so wrapped up in the tale, a tale of rescue; honour and friendship, despite these absurdities; as the ideologies and the true extent of the point of their existence in both the protagonist and supporting toys are questioned. This is certainly one of the most philosophical films about a child's play thing you'll ever see.<br/><br/>Like the first film, Toy Story 2 sees one toy excluded from the space of Andy's room at their new house after having successfully moved at the end of the first one. On this occasion, Woody is stolen at a junk sale on the front lawn of Andy's house during the rescuing of another toy up for sale; the crime perpetrated by an eccentric, chain store owning toy collector named Al (Knight) whom recognises Woody as a rare and expensive collectors item, also a part of a collection of Western themed toys from the 1950s. With an ultimatum in place, the going away of Andy to something called 'cowboy camp' during the summer holiday, the usual gang of Andy's toys in Buzz; Potatoe Head; Rex and Hamm venture off to find him - as Buzz and the other toys take off to rescue Woody before Andy gets home, the camera enjoys a slow crane upwards so as to encompass Al's high-rise which towers over all the other buildings as the magnitude of their mission is enforced.<br/><br/>Primarily, the study of a toy's fear of being replaced from the first film has been updated to that of a toy's shelf life running out in regards to an owner's lust to continue using them. 1995's Toy Story was a circular adventure unfolding out of the Utopian space that was Andy's room, an adventure which saw Woody having come to terms with having to coexist with a newer, fresher, more post-modern toy as Buzz's own arc was explored in that he was not, in fact, a space ranger himself. Here, the venturing away from Andy's new room allows Woody to come to terms with the 'issue' or 'problem' of Andy's growing older, and that it too is a serious topic infused within the life of a toy one needs to come to terms with and coexist with, leading to acceptance.<br/><br/>If anything, the film opens up with a mini-narrative of which resembles a short cartoon; the sort of which you might have play before the feature at a cinema years ago. The expanding of the opening short into this dramatic and blown out of proportion epic as Buzz Lightyear attempts to infiltrate and defeat his nemesis Emperor Zurg is systematic of Toy Story 2's own branching out into larger, more grandeur adventures. We ought to know it's not real, because Buzz resembles his old, deluded self. As the film develops and Woody is taken to a large high-rise marked with a sign in its reception stating ""No Children"", so as to further infuse the watching kids in the audience to 'side' with the toys and further dislike Al, Andy's toys strive to get him back and Woody himself encounters Jessie (Cusack), Stinky Pete (Grammer) and a horse named Bullseye; of which the four of them combine together to produce Woody's Roundup Gang, a franchise favourite with the kid's back in the 1950s.<br/><br/>The film is enjoyable in its inter-cutting of Al's own plight, which includes the bickering with some Japanese businessmen whom are purchasing the Roundup Gang, his strand providing short, sharp bouts of comedy; with Andy's toys' journeying to the building, as Buzz's superiority is emphasised in his cracking of whom the kidnapper is, and Woody himself facing a moral plight of his own in regards to whether he abandons Jessie, Pete and Bullseye so as to return to Andy. In particular, Woody's own arc sees him somewhat loose his head when it transpires he is quite the celebrity figure; both then and now, something that is observed and dealt with within the universe of the film as a relatively negative thing when said character realises there are things that are more important in life. The film wonderfully blends in all of this with its grander physical comedy and the cynicism of both Hamm and Potatoe Head, something that clashes with various other toys whom become involved along the way, one of whom is a second Buzz Lightyear doll acting as a short, sharp and refreshing inclusion. It's bigger, but not better; although thoroughly enjoyable all the same."
"Tweekums","10","0","1","18 July 2010"," Even better than the first
","Often sequels are just an excuse to bleed a few more dollars out of the viewer my turning a good film into a so-so franchise, this however manages to be that rare thing; a sequel that surpasses the original. Woody, Buzz and all the other toys from the first film are back for a new adventure; when Woody is stolen by a toy store owner who needs an original 'Woody' toy to complete a collection of 'Woody's Roundup' toys Buzz and the others must set off to rescue him. Woody however is conflicted about what he should do, he wants to return home to Andy and the other toys but if he does the other toys from the collection he is part of will be put into storage again.<br/><br/>The story is packed with thrills such as the toys causing mayhem as they try to cross a busy road and comedy such as where 'Buzz' and his Nemesis Zurg re-enact the most famous scene from 'The Empire Strikes Back'. This story includes some great new characters such as Jesse the Cowgirl, Stinky Pete the Prospector and Woody's Horse Bullseye. The film even manages a joke about the short supply of Buzz Lightyear toys after the release of the first will which not only doesn't seen too self-referential but adds greatly to the story when Buzz gets replaced by another Buzz Lightyear toy who still believes he can fly and fire lasers. Even though the film is aimed at children the story should appeal to adults just as much and take them back to the innocent days of their childhood when they too found happiness in a box of assorted toys."
"imagiking","7","0","1","9 July 2010"," Toy Story 2: Everything You Could Want
","Following on from the success of its predecessor, Toy Story 2 launched Pixar even further into the animation stratospere. It was only whilst deciding to watch this and the original in preparation for the upcoming third installment that I realised I had never, not even as a child, seen this before. Struggling to understand how, I rushed to right this wrong.<br/><br/>Picking up a few years after the first left us off, Andy's toys live a happy coexistence with his new puppy. When a less functional member of their tribe is taken to the yard sale taking place at the front of the house, Woody mounts his canine steed in a rescue mission. Identified as a rare collector's item by a snooping customer, he is stolen, to be shipped to a museum in Japan. Cue the Buzz led rescue mission, and another miniature adventure.<br/><br/>This one starts strongly, giving us action on a gargantuan scale before pulling back and revealing it to be a game played by Rex: a perfect reintroduction to the characters' world and the start of a recurring joke. We soon meet the puppy, the bark of whom closed the last installment, and see how he has been embraced as a member of the animated family. Things continue in much the same manner as the original, the style of humour all but identical, perhaps a bit more mature, as indeed was its target audience by its release. The same tone too is to be seen here, Woody's early setbacks much akin to his first despairing thoughts of abandonment upon Buzz's arrival. Once the primary plot gets rolling, we get the mix of action, adventure, comedy, and drama of the first all over again, with a whole host of new characters and settings. Particularly amusing and entertaining are the interactions of Buzz and the newer model of himself he finds, his role now reversed to that of Woody at the beginning of the first film in convincing the deluded toy that he is just that. Woody's story is marked by a nicely darker element of being someone's toy, and one which will undoubtedly resonate thematically with installment three. The last half hour or so is full-on action, suspenseful stuff which has everyone rooting for the heroes. Everything you could want for what it is really. Again, this provides a sufficiently compelling kids' film, but one which lack the emotional wow factor of such greats as Wall-E.<br/><br/>Again, Pixar delivers a consistently entertaining movie which will doubtlessly fulfill the cinematic needs of all the kids who see it. Regarding its alleged increase in quality over its forbear, I tend to disagree, though it is very close. Having never seen it until recently, I guess this one just doesn't have the same sentimental legacy for me."
"Robert_duder","8","0","1","4 July 2010"," The Toys ARE back in town and its good to see them!!
","I suppose I could argue all day why Toy Story 2 isn't on the same grand scope as the first film. I think its an incredible feat to even stay on the same playing field as what I consider to be one of the greatest films of all time. Toy Story 2 DOES stay on that playing field but it falls just a tad short of the original greatness and I can tell you why. The original cast all return which is amazing and the magic is still as strong as ever. The story focuses heavily on Woody with Buzz this time coming to his rescue and during Woody's adventure he finds a host of new toys, some that become a permanent part of the cast. The only issue I can take with this film compared to the first is the rest of the cast takes a back seat to Woody and his new companions. The cast is so amazing and the whole Toy box is so fantastic that you just lose something from the overall picture when they aren't at the forefront. The movie is still absolutely a must see and it is an integral part of the now trilogy. Much time is spent at Al's Toy Barn instead of adventuring from one place to another but the concept is still terrific.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks and Tim Allen return to their brilliant roles as Woody and Buzz. No one could ever replace these two. They completely create their respective characters. Somehow the chemistry between their characters just isn't quite the same as it was in the first film. That's not to say it isn't good but they spend more time apart and I think you miss their comradeship. Don Rickles, Jim Varney, Wallace Shawn (still amazing and hilarious as Rex), John Ratzenberger, John Morris, and Laurie Metcalf all return to their roles and I think it would change everything if they hadn't. Its a pleasure to see them back. Newcomers to the cast are downright brilliant. Estelle Harris is hilarious and brilliant as Mrs. Potato Head. Joan Cusack became an instant hit as Jessie the cowgirl. (I personally find her overdone and almost annoying but I know many love her.) Kelsey Grammar is the perfect voice for Stinky Pete the Prospector. My only regret there is that Pete isn't as good a villain as I would have hoped for (he's no lotsa---see Toy Story 3) but he's still good. Joe Ranft is adorable as Wheezy the Penguin, and voice actor expert Jodi Benson adds the perfect voice to the spunky Barbie. Wayne Knight is also a welcomed addition as the bumbling bad guy Al.<br/><br/>So I think you can pick out from my review where I think the film makers stumbled just a little from the original amazing film but expectations would have to be absurdly high. Some of the highlights of this film include the discovery of the Buzz Lightyear aisle at Al's Toy Barn, which hearkens back to the original laughs of Buzz and his first appearance. Joining original director John Lasseter are two more Disney directors, one of whom will go on to direct the incredible Toy Story 3. Ash Brannon, and Lee Unkrich don't have a ton of directorial experience but I imagine if anyone could hone their skills Lasseter would be the perfect director to do it. Toy Story 2 does lack some of the heart of the original, and misses some of the comradeship from the first but Toy Story 2 is still a must see movie for kids and adults alike because the series as a whole is the most brilliant animation you could possibly see. 8/10"

","Toy Story 2 (John Lasseter and Ash Brannon, 1998) is often cited as part of that select band of superior sequels: along with Aliens, X2, Grease 2 and Look Who's Talking Too, but to this reviewer it falls just short. Sure, it builds on the original in a host of ingenious ways, with the arrival of Emperor Zurg a stroke of genius, but the pay-off to that sequence is clunky, stupid and unfunny in a way that Pixar never is, stopping the film in its tracks. And despite the multitude of great running gags (like Rex becoming a computer games nut) and imaginative action sequences (the cones set-piece, that stunning opening scene), the film is never quite as sharp, dark or exciting as the first entry. It's still pretty much fantastic, though - the risible Empire Strikes Back spoof aside - and I enjoyed the film's concessions to heavy sentiment, including Sarah MacLachlan's song When She Loved Me, which soundtracks a moving flashback for Joanna Cusack's cowgirl character Jessie."

","1999's ""Toy Story 2"" is a fine example of one of those rare movie sequels that far surpasses the original. ""Toy Story 2"" is a far superior sequel to its 1995 predecessor, ""Toy Story,"" a film that I will admit I loved watching growing up during the mid '90s, so you could expect my hesitation in viewing a sequel. My fears subsided within the first five minutes of ""Toy Story 2."" You can comment forever about the significantly improved Pixar animation, the increased human-like appearances of the toys, and the high-soaring story (that has many laugh-out-loud nods to past movie epics including ""National Lampoon's Animal House,"" ""Raiders of the Lost Ark,"" ""Jurassic Park,"" and ""The Empire Strikes Back""). But ""Toy Story 2's"" real charm lies in its underlying message. ""Toy Story 2"" involves beloved cowboy toy Woody's (voiced by Tom Hanks) theft by a greedy toy collector named Al (Wayne Knight). So it's up to Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen) to mount a gallant rescue attempt for his best friend. At the apartment of Al, Woody learns that he is actually a rare doll from a 1950's children cartoon and Al is intent on selling Woody and other members from the so-called ""Roundup Gang"" - Jessie (newcomer Joan Cusack), Stinky Pete the Prospector (Kelsey Grammar), and steed Bullseye - to a Japanese toy collector. This was an excellent animated family film from director John Lasseter (who also worked on the first film). Like its predecessor, ""Toy Story 2"" captures what it means to be a child and eventually out-growing your youth, love, and friendship. Does Woody really care about about his friends back in Andy's (John Morris) bedroom and living a good life and being loved in the present, or does he care about living forever as a rare collector's item? ""Toy Story 2"" really has a high nostalgia factor for its viewers, as some have pointed out, and that is probably what makes this movie just as important - arguably more important - than ""Toy Story."" Most of us do have toys that we love as children, but eventually out-grow as we get older (just imagine the rather heart-breaking flashback sequence explaining Cowgirl Jessie's history). I had a collection of stuffed animals as a child and I used to take them everywhere with me because I loved being home so much and they reminded me of being home. I'm 24 now; I didn't get rid of them - I'm not sure I could ever bring myself to do such a thing - but I do keep them on a shelf in my bedroom closet. See what I mean? This is the sort of nostalgia factor that ""Toy Story 2"" elicits from the viewer and makes it a more personal and heart-warming experience than the first film, in addition to simply being action-packed and more entertaining. ""Toy Story 2,"" as I explained, is a vastly improved sequel to its predecessor, the original ""Toy Story."" The story soars, the animation soars and the voice-acting performances, as you would expect, soar, but its message and nostalgia factor seal the deal and make this movie one of the greatest movie sequels ever made.<br/><br/>10/10"

","Toy Story is a tough act to follow. The first film is nearly perfect in every way imaginable. But Toy Story 2 not only meets the high standards set by it's predecessor, it comes close to surpassing them.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks and Tim Allen return as Sheriff Woody and Buzz Lightyear respectively, and this time, Woody is stolen by a greedy toy collector. Woody and the gang discover that he is actually a rare toy based off of a classic 1950's TV show called ""Woody's Roundup."" He meets the rest of the toys from his roundup gang in the collector's apartment, including Jessie the Yodeling Cowgirl, Bullseye the horse, and Stinky Pete the Prospector. He soon discovers that him and his new friends are set to be sold to a museum in Japan. All the while, Buzz gathers up a group of toys to go rescue Woody from his captor and bring him home.<br/><br/>All the original cast returns in this sequel, and some new cast members appear as well, including Joan Cusack as Jessie, Kelsey Grammar as the Prospector, and Wayne Knight as Al McWhiggin, the toy collector. All the new voice talents and characters support the old ones as well as help develop them further.<br/><br/>This time around, the animation is much improved upon. The characters and environments look more realistic and detailed. Another aspect that is improved upon in this film is the comedy. While the first film is also absolutely riotously funny, the sequel ups the ante a bit, and the film is even funnier than the last one.<br/><br/>Overall, Toy Story 2 is a magnificent picture. The writing is tight, witty, and clever throughout, the characters and story are moved forward in a positive direction, and it leaves you feeling good afterward. Another thing I failed to mention in my Toy Story 1 review is the musical score by Randy Newman. I'm personally not a fan of Newman, but his work on the Toy Story films is by far his best work. Toy Story 2 is one of my favorite animated films made, and while it doesn't quite pass up the first, it comes pretty darn close."

","With a Pixar film, you can't really go wrong. There has only been one Pixar sequel. Could you go wrong with that one? No, because Toy story 2 still has it. Though it doesn't quite have what the original had, the film is still definitely worth while.<br/><br/>The sequel starts off, of course, after the original. Buzz and Woody(Tim Allen and Tom Hanks) are no longer enemies. But something goes wrong at a yard sale that Andy's family is having. Trying to save a friend, Woody is stolen from the yard sale by a toy store guy(Wayne Knight, of course). Looking exactly how you'd imagine him to look.<br/><br/>So Woody is taken to a building, where he meets a group of other toys. From the same type of thing. All cowboys. There's Jessie the cowgirl(Joan Cusack), the Prospector(Kelsey Grammar) and a horse named Bullseye. All of these toys used to be a part of a show. And so was Woody. Apparently, these toys are being sent to Japan to be put in a museum. So as Woody tries to escape, Buzz and the rest of the gang set out to rescue him.<br/><br/>What exactly is my problem with the sequel? Well, don't get me wrong I think it's a very good film. My problem with it though is that Woody is kind of annoying. All of his friends are trying to rescue him, desperately might I add, and he wants to go to Japan anyways. It's annoying. <br/><br/>That is really the only problem that I had with Toy story 2. There are some great actors doing the voice work here. Though the sequel isn't quite as good as the original, I am still going to say that it's memorable. I think that if you haven't seen it, then there is something wrong with you. It seems like I say that a lot. Though not a classic, still good film.<br/><br/>Toy story 2:***1/2 out of ****"

","Like the original Toy Story, I first saw the sequel when it originally came out and it happened to be a birthday wish I had to watch it. Not as consistently funny as the first but it was still very entertaining with basically Buzz and Woody changing roles and attitudes and new characters like Jessie, Bullseye, and Stinky Pete adding to the appealing characters lineup. Also, Randy Newman added some new songs like the wistfully sad one called ""When She Loved Me"" sung by Sarah McLachlan or the ""Woody's Roundup"" TV show theme performed by Riders in the Sky. The additional characters are voiced by such familiar talents like Joan Cusack, Kelsey Grammar, and as Al of Al's Toy Barn, Wayne Knight. Like I said, it takes a while before the laughs came but when they did, they provided more fun entertainment for the recent 3-D double feature of this and the original Toy Story that I just rewatched with my movie theatre working friend. So on that note, rush to this and its predecessor as soon as you can! P.S. My friend that I just mentioned noticed a character mention our current hometown of Baton Rouge in the airport scene. R.I.P Jim Varney and Robert Goulet who warbled ""You've Got a Friend in Me"" at the end. And those ""bloopers"" during the end credits are still sooooo hilarious!"
"thesar-2","9","0","1","11 October 2009"," The New Buzz
","I used to love the follow-up 'Toy Story 2' more than its predecessor. After a good 3-D viewing in 2009, I flip-flopped them. Yes, I think #2 was awesome, near perfect, and just as much fun and inventive as the first one, but I think it was slightly off. Just barely. I think it's Cusack's 'Jessie' that I found almost unbearable to watch. Sure, I get her character and where it's coming from, but God, she was annoying and hard to get past. On the positive, she gave the only notable song, and a good one too, in the series so far: ""When She Loved Me"" by Sarah McLachlan. Other than that, they certainly up'd the ante for the technology (even with only a few years in between), the action/adventure, comedy but all the while kept the great ""family/friends"" feel and morals. To switch things up, Woody now has been ""toy-napped"" and it's up to Buzz and peers (still great, never missing a beat from what made them all masterful in #1) to rescue him. I loved the additions to the ""story"" such as the Barbie's, Knight's Chicken/thief, the new Buzz (love the explanation given to what stores did wrong the previous Christmas) and Buzz's nemesis. This was a fun movie to start with and as it progressed, it got a lot better. A lot more fun, adventure, touching and inventive. Rarely will a sequel live up to its original, and 'Toy Story 2' is one of the best ever. It's very apparent that the crew, directors, cast, animators all had enormous fun putting this out, adding all of their own little homages (also seen in #1.) Side note: the 3-D was good, but Disney can never blow me away as other studios have: SEE: 'Monsters Vs. Aliens.'"

"KineticSeoul","8","0","2","7 October 2009"," This is not a superior sequel
","Some say that ""Toy Story 2"" is better than ""Toy Story"" and I have to disagree. This sequel doesn't really add a lot of new elements. The creators did think up cool and interesting ways to use the toys or the abilities of the toys was fun at some parts, but that didn't really do it for me. The scene where the toys are running around the toy store trying to find Woody was amusing and all, but to sum it all up it's basically a rescue mission with toys. Except instead of Woody trying to rescue Buzz, the roles are reversed. It just basically adds new toys and some cameos, but besides the creative ways each of the toys act and do with what they are given, I just don't see how this movie can be superior to the first ""Toy Story"" movie. Even the scene with Zurg was not that necessary, it didn't really add or take away from the film.<br/><br/>***Might be spoiler*** Buzz who is the character that Tim Allen played, but entertaining cause of the personality and stood out from the other toys. But in this one he isn't as interesting and I know they had to go in this direction, but with it's character but it was still dull compared to his character in the first movie and thus the creators just tossed a second Buzz in the film.<br/><br/>All in all, it was a fun movie but definitely not superior to the first ""Toy Story'<br/><br/>8/10"

Somehow I never have seen this movie after who knows how many years of it being out and me loving Pixar. It is sad that I have to give it a 9 and not a 10 and the only reason is that is not as good as Toy Story. It is a great movie that technically is a huge stop up for Pixar and some of the effects were fantastic. I am mainly thinking of how good some of textures were and the reflection on the wooden floor of the toys. The story is great and funny, but did not resonate with me as much as the other films. I am not a hundred percent sure why, but there are probably a multitude of reasons. It is hard to recapture the love I had for the first movie with the same characters. I do love that the animators actually have quite a bit of story to tell with these characters and sequels do not feel forced. There is nothing wrong with this film other than it is not as good as some of the other Pixar films."

Toy Story 2 is what a kids movie should be like, it's non-stop fun, action and adventure. Once again Pixar Animation Studious deliver a heart-warming animated movie that's highly enjoyable on all levels for all ages.

My favorite scenes were when Andy's Toys were walking to Al's Toy Barn and Hamm's courke falls out and he's like All right! Nobody look TTL I get my courke back in! I also liked it when the Tour Guide Barbie jumps into the car with the toys and flurts with Mr.PotatoHead and Mr. PotatoHead says I'm a married spud! I'm a married spud! And Hamm pushes him aside so he can sit next to Tour Guide Barbie saying Then Make Room for the singles fellas! And last but not least I liked it when they're in the airport and Slinky gets caught by another suitcase and he's screaming Buzz! Buzz! My bands going to end route! Those were the funniest scenes!

","Toy shop owner Al kidnaps Woody and plans to display him in a museum in Japan, but Buzz and the gang plan to stop him.<br/><br/>Pixar's 1995 triumph Toy Story was arguably the finest animation of all time and its success brought on this sequel which is faster and more daring, if not quite as sharp.<br/><br/>This 1999 picture has one of the finest openings you will ever see and will beat any other animation opening; even Wall-E trundling along is no match for this. In space we see Buzz Lightyear zooming towards an alien infested planet and what follows is a jaw dropping action soaked sequence of good versus evil with a fine comic twist.<br/><br/>Again we are invited into the toys lives as they face another human tradition that will determine their lives, a yard sale, which sets the story going in a frantic and funny way.<br/><br/>Evidently a viewing of the first is a necessity to understand the characters and their environment as this film makes plenty of references to the first.<br/><br/>There are plenty of similarities to its Oscar nominated predecessor. For example, the idea of facing demons, adjusting to a different life and importantly friendship. Toy Story was brilliant for having an originality and a great collection of personal messages to its viewers.<br/><br/>This sequel feels frequently like the first with the same jokes with the occasional twist. A lot of scenes can be predictable and unfunny.<br/><br/>However this film differs by being more relaxed in its storytelling approach. There is more comedy which will delight the family for popcorn viewing. There is a delightful collection of intertextuality from 2001: a space odyssey, Jurassic Park and a hilarious parody of Star Wars: the empire strikes back, which will have the adults in stitches.<br/><br/>This is not to say the franchise has lost its sentimental side. This in a lot of ways is more upsetting than the first as it explores the inevitable of when a child no longer plays with toys. This is not a cheesy coming of age representation, but a hard dramatic rite of passage, which will cast your mind back to the time when you no longer played around.<br/><br/>As I write a third instalment is being filmed and hopefully we can see another film with great humour and a hard hitting message.<br/><br/>The DVD also has a fine collection of outtakes during the credits which are the funniest thing about it.<br/><br/>More adventurous and relaxed, Toy Story 2 is quite different from the first with more comedy and another hard message."

","I have personally seen Toy Story 1 at least 20 times with my children and by watching part 2; I must admit they're both thumbs-up movies. I thought how anyone could make such movies so real until the 2nd one came along. The first Toy Story does not picture human beings very much but those characters like Woody, Buzz Light-year, Mr. Potato-Head, etc. are so true-to-life that you take them for real. Every movement they make mimics a real life. A salute to the cast, crew members, producers, and also Disney and Pixar for a job well done. The creative energy and technology that were put into these films remain impressive today, and the themes are timeless. One doesn't usually pin too much of 2nd's and 3rd's, especially when the first one is already so good. Toy Story 2 had proved me wrong. Now I think, if I see the 2nd, I wouldn't want to see so much of the first anymore. Toy Story 2's human characters are just so real and adorable. You must watch both, the first, then the second, in any case, to appreciate them both. It is not a continuing story line but you have to watch the first to know how they all came about. It's a wonderful movie which will touch the hearts of children and adults alike. Highly recommended again If you have kids you and must own this DVD collection. It's a movie they can be watch over and over, plus its part of history. The first Toy Story was the first 100% computer generated movie. That alone makes it worth while, but adds the fact that it is a great movie and you have a winner. Toy Story II is one of the exceptions when it comes to sequels. It is actually better than the original. I have put this movie on my list of ""All Time Favorites."""
"arc_a2007","8","0","1","26 August 2008"," Truly one of the greatest sequels of all time.
","So here we are again, Woody and Buzz Lightyear return for another adventure on the big screen. All their friends have made a triumphant return as well, but they've brought along a few new faces for the ride. With sequels, new characters are usually tacked on carelessly for no good reason, but with Toy Story 2, these characters actually make sense in the film's world. Not only that, but they're *gasp* integral to the story! This is one of the things that makes Toy Story 2 a great sequel. Although I can't say why Pixar wanted Kelsey Grammar to do the voice of the Prospector, an ornery old mountain-man type. Taking into consideration his personality throughout the film though, it makes a lot more sense. Moving on... As always, Pixar excels in the emotion department. It's rare that a film can make you give a crap about the characters, and Pixar continue to achieve exactly that. You may find yourself sympathizing with Woody during the film, you may even find yourself torn between different emotions, just like the characters involved. I've noticed recently that there are parental issues holding the backbone of this film. Woody is afraid of Andy outgrowing him just like parents are afraid their children will outgrow them. In this way, it speaks to parents in a way that even more adult-oriented films cannot. These kind of issues are what made other Pixar films like Finding Nemo and The Incredibles so great. The film is chock full of references to the first. It's so full of them in fact, that it sometimes feels forced. This is especially strong when the characters have a chance re-encounter with the vending machine aliens from the first movie. Also, the whole Star Wars reference mini-scene seemed to come from nowhere, go nowhere and have no real purpose. But these are really the only complaints I have, very minor ones at that. But when it all comes down to it, it's amazing that Pixar managed to make a worthy sequel to one of the greatest animated films of all time. And I do mean it when I say this is truly one of the greatest sequels of all time. Mind you, it doesn't have a lot of competition in that field, but it still comes out on top by a landslide."

This is a classic children's story that adults can definitely relate to. In Toy Story 2, Woody must choose between staying in a museum forever, perfectly preserved as he is but never played with or to go back to his old life. It's a wonderful joyous message that says that toys are meant to be played with, life is meant to be lived. No one is meant to sit around and get stodgy and old in a museum. There are so many wonderful, funny moments in this film. The scene with the traffic cones is one of the funniest scenes of all time. This is a great, great movie."

","The history of film-making has shown that sequels are rarely ever a patch on the original. And only rarely ever can a sequel overcome its predecessor and oftentimes there are complex reasons why. An example was ""The Terminator"" and ""Terminator 2"". The sequel is considered to be better, then again, it was made on a higher budget and a longer shooting schedule.<br/><br/>But when a sequel can overcome a prequel when both were made on similar budgets and schedules, then the filmmakers really have outdone themselves. The first ""Toy Story"" was and still is a marvelous, funny, classic animated film that is perfect for family entertainment. Pixar worked their magic again when they gathered the cast and crew to make ""Toy Story 2"", which is even better. Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, Jim Varney, and the others reprise their roles as the toys that come to life whenever there's no human around to witness. The voice acting, once again, is flawless and the screenwriters did a fantastic job with the script.<br/><br/>The humor in the film is even more effective than the hilarious examples from the first ""Toy Story"". A favorite part of mine is when the rescue party out to find Woody, who has been stolen by a toy collector, find they have to cross a busy highway. Rex, after seeing a car crush an aluminum can, simply says in a laconic ""Oh, well, we tried."" and tries to walk away. Like with the first film, I now find the humor, the animation, and the film overall even better than when I first saw and adored it as a child.<br/><br/>To make a long story short, ""Toy Story 2"" is a modern-day classic. It outdoes an original, which is miraculous seeing as how the original was magnificent and flawless. It is perfectly-paced, is effectively animated, never falls short on its entertainment value, and is a film I highly recommend for audience members of all ages. It won't frighten children, but it also won't be too subtle for teenagers and adults."

Jessie, Stinky, and Bullseye are ecstatic about the prospect of immortality under glass in a museum. They have been stacked up in storage, a doll's equivalent to limbo, and they refuse to go back. Initially, Woody cottons to the idea of going to Japan. McWhiggin cleans him up and mends his broken arm. Woody found himself in this mess because Andy broke his arm accidentally during some rough horseplay before he shelved poor Woody. Locked on the horns of a dilemma, Woody weighs his love for Andy versus his quest for immortality.<br/><br/>""Toy Story 2"" emerges as a veritable ""Schindler's List"" for animated characters. The rather philosophical plot ponders issues such as toy immortality and the fickle nature of a child's love. The worst thing you can say about ""Toy Story 2"" is that it is merchandising with a melodrama. Thematically, in a poke at ""Pokemon,"" ""Toy Story 2"" argues that toys should be loved and played with instead of collected to gather dust on display. Altogether, ""Toy Story 2"" qualifies as a hilarious treat for youngsters that adults can appreciate, too."

","A fine fine movie that really is a rarity in many ways. It's an animated movie which works on both the levels intended. Yes as expected it is great for children but unusually it succeeds with the jokes aimed at adults to (and as we adults know most of its competitors fail miserably there). Then we have the double whammy of a sequel that lives up to and in many cases surpasses the original (hard to think of many other candidates for that past the mighty duo of 'The Godfather Part II' & 'The Empire Strikes Back'), and that is even with Toy Story 2's story not being that far removed from that of the original! This time it is Buzz that has to save Woody but from a much more evil perpetrator than the kid next door, this time it is from an adult and not even a normal one at that a toy shop owner who intends to ship woody of to a toy museum in Japan and make himself a tidy sum in doing so. This results in a number of great set pieces which have great elements of action and comedy binding them together. As one expects from Pixar the animation is superb, but as with most of their other movies (and where so many of their competitors fail) it is the quality of the script that is the bedrock of this movie. A tight story with a cracking script that has endless one liners and equal amounts of action, comedy and pathos all welded together by some superb direction make this a timeless classic."

","I have not seen the first Toy Story for ages, but what I remember is a film with hardly any emotion, just exciting things happening and a boy who rips toys apart and schtuff. However, I see this quite often and I very much like it! It is a very clever, funny and often beautiful film, possessing many qualities that most good films ought to have. For a Pixar film it is also moderately relaxing, which makes it easier for me to watch it. The characters are well developed, including both the new ones and the old ones. Tom Hanks is brilliant as Woody!<br/><br/>Basically there are so many things to say about this film. I can hardly list them all, so you will have to watch this for yourself! :-) <br/><br/>There are a few things I do not like about it, as well. The part where Andy just leaves Woody is completely un-understandable and the Star Wars spoofs are a little bit too obvious.<br/><br/>This film (as you have probably guessed or already know) is about toys that come to life. In this, the cowboy doll Woody is about to go on a Cowboy Camp with his owner Andy, but his arm rips and Andy leaves him! Woody misses Andy, but many other things occur in the meantime...<br/><br/>I recommend this to people who like to be relaxed by Pixar Films and for people who still respect toys.

"cosmorados","9","0","1","24 February 2008"," The best sequel of all time
","If you discount ""Empire"" as part of a sequel, and unlike many of the people who address the board I always feel that the Godfather part II feels like a rehash of the first with the similar ending. The first ""Toy Story"" was a film that pushed the boundaries of what computer animation could do, but it feels like a tester, like the first. It doesn't go to places with the script and characters the way that this one does. There are moments in this film that move and pull on the heartstrings in the same way that the Disney master-classes of the past such as ""Snow White"" and ""Dumbo"", especially with such intricately marvellous moments such as the cleaning of Woody and Jessie's song that even now manages to wring a tear out of me.<br/><br/>This movie starts where the last one left off with Buzz and Woody being the best of friends, however after an accident whilst being played with, Woody's arm is ripped and he is left on the shelf. After coming to terms with the fact that he may be binned Woody, through a natural series of events, discovers who he is and the fact that a child of Andy's age having a toy like Woody all becomes clear.<br/><br/>The voice work of Hanks and Allen is as good as ever, but with Kelsey Grammar and a hyper Joan Cusack (YEEE-HAAA!) added the cast improves no end. The animation in this film has also improved, and even though it is not of the standard of Monsters Inc or the Incredibles, it's still very passable. <br/><br/>This film feels like what I wanted out of Toy Story and didn't get. Buzz is more likable, Woody's fantastic and the message within the film of the true value of loyalty and friendship, with the sad part being that the price we pay for these things is eventually loss.<br/><br/>If the first film was a test of what the animators could do, then this is a test of what the writers and directors can do with the new toy of computer animation.<br/><br/>Results of the test...Straight A."

Now I'm 18, i decided to give the movie another viewing. I still found the characters wonderful to watch, and the visuals of the movie good (although not as good as recent Pixar films), i just found it hard to watch it on without thinking whether this would be classified as a children's film or not. It is a wonderfully crafted movie without any flaws, but it might have a hard job keeping the older viewers interested.<br/><br/>""Oh, i thought your broken.

This is one of the most overrated sequels ever, even this movie was a huge financial success worldwide.<br/><br/>OK, now it's sounds that I'm just complaining about this movie. I enjoyed this film and I'm still enjoying it. But this movie is a little bit more sentimental than the first film, it has more emotions and that's why I think this film is weaker. It contains serious subjects matters like being abandoned, etc. It's okay that Pixar is making a movie about serious subject matters and it makes it more emotional. But it seems darker than the first movie.<br/><br/>The script isn't bad, but comparing to the first film where it was more action sequences involved, the story of this movie is a little bit futile. Randy Newmans score is disturbing the story instead of supporting the story. Even we can really connect with Woody on this picture (you guys who have seen the movie know what I'm talking' about, right?), I still like him more in the first film. So the same with Buzz.<br/><br/>OK, enough complaining about this picture. It seems that I'm comparing this movie to the first one, which I'm doing (who is natural to do with a sequel), but it's okay to like the first movie better, isn't it?

","In 1999,the PIXAR gang was rife with limited(but growing)success from 1995's Toy Story and 1998's A Bug's Life. Disney and much of the film world still seemed somewhat cautious(if not skeptical),and probably figured a four year wait on following up the to-date signature success entry was a safe number for a company that was far too comfortable with(and at the time,had not yet been shaken away from)traditional,hand-drawn animation. While the success of this entrant did not prove them wrong,it may've opened the door to much more of what we Se today in movies:mostly or completely computerized animation.<br/><br/>The story of this Toy Story is pretty much an inverse to the first,only this time,instead of Buzz Lightyear being whisked away from the group somehow,it's Cowboy Woody's turn to somehow get swept away from the herd. When Woody(voice of Tom Hanks)rescues a forgotten toy penguin named Wheezy from being a cheap sale at the family garage sale,he is taken up,bought and locked away by an unscrupulous toy store magnet named Al(voice of Wayne Knight,which may've been the most inspired of this inspired vocal casting of this film). Without their traditional leader,the toys get behind Buzz(Tim Allen,just piling on to his ""Kid/Family friendly"" career in movies and t.v.) to try and rescue their friend,for which the journey is going to be a lot more perilous than the last time out.<br/><br/>The whole gang is back for this one: Don Rickles as Mr.Potato Head,John Ratzenberger(A PIXAR favorite)as Hamm the Piggy bank,the late JIm VArney as Slinky Dogg,Annie Potts as Bo Peep,R.Lee Ermey as the Toy soldier leader,Wallace Shawn as T-Rex and Estelle Harris as Mrs.POtato Head. Added to the mix(and Not to the least importance)are Joan Cusack and Kelsey Grammar as Yodeling Cowboy Annie and Prospector Stinky Pete(respectively),two toys from the obsolete line of characters from which Woody was brought out of,both wanting to reunite with Woody permanently. Additional voice help is a myriad of talent,much of whom(such as the late JOe RAnft)are also PIXAR regulars,and add a lot of solid background to this effort. Directors John LAsseter and Ash Brannon,working off a script co-authored by Lasseter and Pete Docter,are able to seamlessly,seemingly effortlessly craft something bold,beautiful and unique out of almost the same construct and characters,which is no mean feat. A keeper of a movie,whether you have kids or are just a big kid yourself."

Here are some of the main things that the creators have improved in the movie which has made it better than the prequel:<br/><br/>1) Woody was not shown too talkative and he didn't keep shouting like a mad person all the time, that's because he had lesser role in the film.<br/><br/>2) Buzz Lightyear was my favorite in both the movies as he is shown as a brave, a bit cartoonish character who risks his own life to save has friend's life.<br/><br/>3) Jessie and the horse were really good in the film. Jessie was not annoying in the movie at all, even if she kept sulking in the movie. Her voice casting was done perfectly and I felt really bad when she told about her life.<br/><br/>4) There were many new characters in the movie who added zing to the film. The film also parodied Star Wars in one part of the film which was really funny.<br/><br/>5) Mr. Potato head was not annoying in the film and also went to rescue Woody.<br/><br/>6) There were few other side stories in the film which made the film more interesting. <br/><br/>There were a few things that the film could have improved:<br/><br/>1) The barbie dolls in the film didn't look too real and bright. The looked more artificial even when they became alive.<br/><br/>2) Nobody could see the toys moving through the streets even though they were hidden and caused a number of accidents.<br/><br/>3) There a few things that were similar to the prequel.

The story isn't too much like the first, like some sequels are, and yet it still keeps the spirit of the first one. We see our favorite characters from the first one and we see some cool new characters as well. It is a good clean film, unlike many films these days that have too much swearing, violence, and/or sex. Toy Story 2 is suitable and enjoyable for kids, and adults will find it fun too. This is the perfect example that Pixar has never made a bad film. It's well-made and pure fun.

When Wheezy, a toy with a broken squeaker, is taken down to be sold at a yard sale, Woody tries to rescue him by jumping down from the shelf he had been put on, and hopping on to Andy's puppy Buster.

Al, a toy store owner, turns around, and takes Woody's hat with him. When he asks Andy's mom for him, she says she didn't know how we got down there. Although she locks him in a toolbox, Al takes the key and steals him. Meanwhile, Buzz chases Al down. When he falls off, he goes back with only one clue: LZTYBRN. He figures out that the kidnapper was Al. They turn on the TV, and see the commercial on. Etch draws the map down, and Buzz copies it. He, Mr. Potato Head, Rex, Hamm, and Slinky go to save Woody. Well, Woody finds out he was the star of an old TV show, and meets his co-stars. Then, he finds out they're headed for a museum in Japan. When he gets fixed, he almost goes, but decides not to. When Buzz is replaced by a newer Space Ranger, he tries to catch up to them. Soon before the plane will take off, the toys come in, but Woody rejects them. Then, he hears on the TV a model of him saying exactly what causes him to want to go. But one of his costars, Stinky Pete, blocks the way for Woody to go. When in the airport, Buzz finds Stinky Pete. But Woody, reunited with the gang, leaves him in the care of a girl Andy's age, and his other two partners, Jessie and Bullseye, join the friends on the trip back to Andy's house. This is for sure one of the greatest movies of all time!"

","Good film, but nothing extraordinary.<br/><br/>The animation was as good (if not better, due to the advance of technology) as in the first movie and this is a solid movie, good entertainment. I however do not share the enthusiasm of most critics. I think that (same as in the first Toy Story) the screenplay lacks 'depth' and witty dialog. 'Nemo' and especially 'Shark Tale' have later proved how good an animated film can really be... In my opinion, the only characters that are actually fun to watch and do have some character development are Mr. Potato Head and Rex the Dinosaur. This also thanks to excellent acting (voices) by respectively Don Rickles and Wallace Shawn whose performances are far better than those of the two stars, Hanks and Allen. One of the two (if not both) would definitely have deserved at least an Oscar Nomination for their performances in both films."

He ends up being stolen by a man named Al who runs a chain of toy stores. So, all the other toys have to go and save him. Conveniently, the little boy is gone away to camp, so he won't know. When Woody gets to Al's apartment, he discovers that he is a doll from an old show called ""Woody's Roundup"", thanks to his box mates Jesse and Stinky Pete the Prospector.<br/><br/>Simply put, this is a good movie. Thankfully, it doesn't rehash the plot of Toy Story 1. It's also got very well done drama parts. More so than the first movie. Most of the time, dialogue is good. However, there were points in the movie where I cringed a little bit, like the part where the pig loses his cork. And half the dialogue from the Roundup Gang was cringe worthy because of the annoying stereotypical west voices. Yeah, we get it, you're cowboys. Zippity-do-dah. Still, this is a solid movie.

Woody's Round-Up gang seems to more closely resemble a group of stereotypes than real cowboys.

","I couldn't actually believe that I hadn't seen Toy Story 2 when it popped up on Television at Xmas, it seemed so long ago and since I enjoyed Toy Story so much there was no reason not to have seen the follow up. Yet I hadn't, for some strange reason it had dropped off my list of what to watch, so I sat down with a glass of something nice and red and returned to the world of toys.<br/><br/>There's nothing too different about this movie from the first apart from the storyline itself, the characters and their voices are all the same, and they've recaptured them perfectly for this movie. Probably the only negative point of the similarity is the animation, CGI has moved on since Toy Story and it shows a little here, however what is good is that the animation of Toy Story has a unique quality to it and even if you were to see a few seconds without any recognisable characters you would know it was a Toy Story movie. So although the animation appears slightly dated (especially seeing it years after release) it does help to pull you into that world again.<br/><br/>Cleverly though the writers have looked at the world of toys and looked for other challenges that they would face if they really were alive, and they've come up with some superb ideas. They've created situations and scenes that are extremely imaginative and yet so obvious (if you were a toy), and what they've pulled out of these are some great performances for the characters and actors, and some genuinely funny moments. Often with a sequel you are treated to an inferior story and less laughs (with a comedy anyway, with other genres you often get more laughs!) but what they've done here is to raise the bar over the original Toy Story, and frankly it was something I just couldn't believe they could do.<br/><br/>The characters are genuinely lovable and understandable, it's all too easy to get attached to them and be pulled into their world. Before long you find yourself caring for them and you'll be feeling their highs and lows, and even a small lump in the throat at times.<br/><br/>There were a few nods to other movies in here, again I won't spoil it by listing them, but they added to the adult factor of the film, something which Pixar has really managed to comprehend. They manage time and time again to make a movie which appeals to both children and adults together without any clash of the two. It will certainly be interesting to see where the Disney only sequel will go.<br/><br/>Overall it's a very satisfying movie giving you everything you want from a good family movie, whether you be a kid or an adult, or even somewhere in between, it's a great fun movie with some good laughs, and definitely on a par if not better than the original."
"paul2001sw-1","9","0","1","23 April 2005"," Beyond infinity!
","These days, every film Pixar makes is hailed as a masterpiece, based on the winning formula of sophisticated computer animation and lots of jokes that parents can get as well. But many of these films could have been made using conventional techniques, and although the jokes may be sly, the basic premise of the plot is frequently dull and familiar: heroic, cute outsider wins the day and gets the girl. In my books, more recent efforts fail to truly match the original 'Toy Story'. The uniqueness of 'Toy Story' is based on two things. Firstly, that the plot depends on switching between two levels of reality (the toys, who are the leading characters, lie passive as their owner plays with them but (just as we all liked to imagine they did) play among themselves when the children aren't around). Being able to assimilate this fantasy world within a real-looking environment is this central to the film. And secondly, mapped to an adult domain, the subject matter of 'Toy Story' is actually desperately bleak: what we have is an allegory for human obsolescence and death, and the delusional strategies we employ to hide from this unbearable truth. One feels for these toys, even though they win out in both of the two movies, because we know that in the end, there is only the promise of inevitable defeat.<br/><br/>'Toy Story 2' isn't quite as fresh as the mould-breaking original, but the scriptwriters have done a good job of taking its ideas forward, adding new levels of self-awareness (and self-referencing) to the plot. The jokes are good, the morbid streak remains, the only down-side is that we now expect all our animations to look this good. Together with its predecessor, it probably represents the most subversive film Disney have ever made, and a movie even Uncle Scrooge will enjoy."

","I loved the original Toy Story, and when I found out they were making a sequel I wasn't sure how good it was going to be. Well, I certainly was amazed when I went to see it. The animation is better, the story line is also better, and there are even more characters and more uproarious humor.<br/><br/>The story picks up from where the second one left off, only this time, Woody is stolen by a greedy toy collector. The other toys led by Buzz go off to find him. While Woody is stolen, he finds out who he really is. Throughout the movie, the toys learn a good lesson of morals and making the right choice.<br/><br/>There are several references to other movies, making this a very hilarious film, with plenty of action and a creative opening scene. This movie teaches us about the origin of Woody, and even Buzz Lightyear. The animation is quite impressive, and this movie proves that the Pixar company never goes wrong, and is capable of making sequels superior to the originals."

","Pixar's brilliant TOY STORY 2 is not merely an unusually good sequel, an exceptionally good cartoon, or a great movie, it's a genuine thrill... one of those moments when regardless of your age or experience, you may be caught utterly off-guard.<br/><br/>John Lasseter had already defined himself as one of the great animation directors with the amusing TOY STORY and superior A BUG'S LIFE, but here he outdoes himself with a thoroughly absorbing and extremely clever film that doubles as a powerhouse of strong writing and characterization. Other than ""The Simpsons,"" when before has a cartoon explored such rich emotional territory with such subtlety and so little pandering? The concerns of this film are universal, with appeal that crosses the boundaries of age, something so-called ""family films"" with their pseudo-hip humor and dumbed-down dramatics rarely do anymore.<br/><br/>TOY STORY was a fun movie and a technically astonishing one, but it couldn't shake the veneer of an Event Picture for the movie-brat set, and its depth was somewhat confined, at least in comparison to the five subsequent Pixar efforts, all of which have surpassed it. What's so impressive about the sequel is how much it stands on its own, and the fact that it explores every conceivable avenue of its story. Even the basic plot line is brilliant -- broken toy Woody is left behind and turns out to be a collectible, cherished by cynical fatso Al of Al's Toy Barn.<br/><br/>That the Pixar crew could craft something entertaining out of this is no shocker. A BUG'S LIFE was also leaps and bounds above their feature debut, full of setpieces and performances on a par with classic Disney material. But TOY STORY 2 one-ups basically everything that came out of feature animation in the preceding ten years (possible exceptions, at least from the U.S., are limited to BEAUTY AND THE BEAST and THE IRON GIANT). It has a spark, an energy, an enthusiasm and assurance, ingredients that have become precious.<br/><br/>It seems as if this purely joyous movie marked the point when Pixar went from the cool little CG place out west to the legit ground-zero of Quality Cartoons. If I had to pinpoint the moment when I became convinced, it would be the ""When She Loved Me"" scene. I have always admired Pixar's resistance to feature-animation conventions, particularly musical sequences, and this deeply sincere bit exemplifies their own devotion to storytelling. In weaker hands it could have easily been maudlin, sappy and irritating. It never breaks that line and yet it's still extraordinarily sad and somehow real. When you can get that out of an inanimate object's emotional distress, you're witnessing some kind of remarkable talent."

","(spoilers)<br/><br/>Toy Story has always been a favorite movie of mine, and I was really looking forward to the sequel. My excitement paid off, as I found the film even more enjoyable than the first flick. The main reason is because it fixes the one complaint I had with the first film, which is that as good as it was, it pretty much only focused on Woody and Buzz, the other toys, with the exception of RC and the army men, really didn't do... anything. Not so with the sequel. Here characters like Potato Head, Slinky-Dog, Ham, Rex, and even those little green men get some chances to shine. The jokes are some of my favorites, notably Rex trying to beat a Buzz Lightyear video game, and trying to get the strategy guide to find out how. Being a video game fan myself, I found this scene hilarious. I feel this is an excellent sequel, and a must-see for any animation fan."

","TOY STORY 2 can now proudly join the ranks of films that made me cry. This is a proud collective of films, and very exclusive, including only LADDER 49, SIMON BIRCH, and OLD YELLER. The element that sets this one apart from the other tearjerkers on my list is that TOY STORY 2 isn't trying to be manipulative, while the others, well-crafted and heartfelt as they may be, were. This film pulled some genuine tears out of me because its characters were so endearing, and their pain so palpable, that I could easily identify with them. This feat is all the more impressive considering that the characters are computer animated dolls.<br/><br/>Also enhancing the experience is that the rest of the film is a joyous, funny and surprisingly insightful joy ride. It may well be the best of the Pixar films (the recent THE INCREDIBLES being a close second). The story involves the characters from the original hit TOY STORY. Favorites like Woody the Cowboy (Tom Hanks), Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen), Rex (Wallace Shawn), Hamm (John Ratzenberger), Mr. Potato Head (Don Rickles), and Slinky Dog (Jim Varney, may he rest in peace) are all back, and in a completely original, genre-defining story. Woody has long been the favorite toy of young Andy, but a small rip on his arm gets him shelved and left behind while the boy goes to cowboy camp. One thing leads to another, and Woody is accidentally sold off in a yard sale to Al (the invaluable Wayne Knight), a slovenly toy collector who owns a local toy store. While Buzz and company plan a dangerous rescue mission, Woody is placed in a Lucite case and discovers more about himself than he ever knew. It turns out, he was the star of his own marionette children's show in the fifties, Woody's Round-Up, and that the round-up also included Jessie (Joan Cusack), Stinky Pete the Prospector (Kelsey Grammar, in Sideshow Bob mode), and Bullseye the horse. His arrival to Al's apartment signals the completion of the set, and now the four toys are going to be sold to a toy museum in Japan. Now Woody has to face a dilemma: go back to Andy and wait for the kid to grow up and forget him, or spend eternity behind glass to be admired by children forever. <br/><br/>This conundrum represents some of the most adult thinking in a children's cartoon ever written. Cusack is responsible for the tear-jerking moment, as she reminisces about her life with her previous owner, Emily, before the girl grew up and abandoned her under the bed. There's a lovely song, 'When She Loved Me,' playing over the background, and beautiful computer-animated shots of sunlight pouring through autumn leaves while Jessie and Emily go for car rides through the country. I finally lost it at the sight of Jessie peering forlornly though a slot in a box marked 'donations,' while the car they shared so many rides in drives down the dirt road. It's rare that a film with real people can have that effect on me, so all the more credit to director John Lasseter and his crew. <br/><br/>The film concludes with a frantic, ten-minute chase/escape, and Buzz, Rex, Slinky, Hamm and Potato Head try to save Woody and friends from the case headed for Japan. They commandeer a truck, battle villainous toys on the conveyor belt, chase the luggage transport on horseback and finally leap out of a moving jet liner to safety. It's all quite un reasonably thrilling. There are also several laugh-out-loud moments, such as the identity of Buzz's father, the Barbie go-go party, and the implementation of a Buzz Lightyear video game strategy guide as an essential plot device. <br/><br/>Pixar's record seems to be untouchable, as they churn out quality animated films like they were minting money. TOY STORY 2 stands as their crowning achievement, one that should be mimicked but likely never will be."
"stargunner","9","0","2","21 November 2004"," Not near as good as the first
","When this movie came out the hype generated a lot of positive feeling around this movie, which I think attributes to it generally being rated better than its predecessor. Even here on IMDb's top animation list, Toy Story 2 is far ahead of the first and it has no hopes of catching up.<br/><br/>What killed this movie for me was the introduction of strange new characters. I never warmed up to Jessie and Bullseye, and I don't consider The Prospector a very worthy protagonist. The set of new characters don't further the greatness of the first Toy Story, and I felt I had nothing in common with them. <br/><br/>I was enjoying Toy Story 2 only when the original crew was on screen, rather than Woody's new friends and enemies.<br/><br/>The musical scene was probably the point I realized that Toy Story 2 was not going to live up to the first. Really, If you watch the first again, you'll realize that what the first film was centered around (Buzz and Woody's conflict), was so much more engaging and true then a bunch of psychopathic toys that have been locked up in a box for decades.<br/><br/>I'm sure I'm not alone, and it's too late to switch the ratings between these two movies, but I feel they should be. It's not that Toy Story 2 is a bad movie, it's simply not as good as the first."

"justafanuk","10","0","1","18 September 2003"," Toy Story 2 is simply The Godfather Part Two of animation!
","Toy Story became one of my favourite films the moment I finished watching it, and made such a huge impact on me I was near terrified when I heard a sequel was being planned, especially since it was only ever meant to be a straight to video release. How foolish it was of me to worry, for In Pixar I Trust. <br/><br/>Toy Story 2 is not only one of the best films of 1999, nor simply one of the few sequels which can actually surpass a superb original, for me this is without question one of the best films ever made! I can't remember how many times I've seen it now but with each viewing I feel a stronger emotional response toward it, something which I would expect to be diminished through repetition, as is the case with other films I've watched repeatedly over time. <br/><br/>Like all the best sequels, the film contains elements from the original without being merely a rehash of plot and situations, it builds on the development of established characters while creating new ones, but most importantly, it can survive as a film in it's own right away from the original. Just like The Godfather Part Two, Aliens, A Very Brady Sequel (yes, really!) and Bill And Ted's Bogus Journey, Toy Story 2 gives us a completely new universe where the film is set but populated with the same characters that we love. And like the examples mentioned above, the filmmakers are intelligent enough to give us situations that seem similar enough to events in the original to provide us with a thematic link, but are then twisted enough to become something original in itself. An simple example occurs when the gang set off to find Woody. In the original Woody had to leave his friends behind to rescue Buzz after he mistakenly knocked him out of a window. This time it's Buzz who has to lead the rescue, but he has all his friends working alongside him, which leads to necessary (and comical) support from Slinky, Rex, Mr Potato Head and Hamm. Another example found later in the film is having effectively two different Buzz's, one of which is still stuck in Space Ranger mode, and our own, now wiser Buzz who just looks on with embarrassed detachment. <br/><br/>Going into spoiler territory now so, y'know the drill.<br/><br/>This time around they don't waste any screentime. After an utterly stunning opening sequence involving Buzz and Sector 9 of the Gamma Quadrant, Woody is soon stolen by a nasty little toy collector known as Al. Once Buzz and the rest of the troops discover where he is, they lead a search and rescue expedition to Al's Toy Barn. Meanwhile Woody is being primed to be sold as part of a collection to a toy museum in Japan, and it's here Woody realises that he has roots stretching far beyond his little wooden legs. As leader of the Round-Up Gang, Woody was one of THE original classic toys of yesteryear with enough merchandise to make Barbie blush. He even had his own TV show before Sputnik launched and space toys then found their way into the hands of children. Completing Woody's Gang are Jesse the cowgirl, Stinky Pete the prospector and Bullseye his horse. His cohorts are overjoyed to see their long missing centrepiece until they realise he actually likes the idea of being played with merely as a toy. They had their hearts set on becoming immortalised within a glass frame forever. When he tries to convince his new found friends of the importance of being a toy, he realises that things aren't always as clear cut as they once seemed and that someone in the Gang has their own separate plan for their collective prosperity<br/><br/>Back on Buzz's adventure he discovers his arch nemesis Emperor Zurg, and a whole aisle worth of Buzz Lightyear's, one of which manages to escape and cause much consternation for our hero. I really love the symmetry that they play with in this film. The original had Buzz discovering his roots via a TV commercial and realising that although he wasn't as important as he thought, being simply a child's plaything and not an Intergalactic Space Ranger, his purpose was for a much greater good in being a companion for not only Andy, but also for Woody. This time around it's Woody who discovers his real' past, also via television. But while he is already happy in the knowledge that Andy is his main occupation and that Buzz is his equal in the toybox, when he realises he's a hugely popular toy, he's forced to make a choice between his exciting new life in Japan, or to continue with his safe routine life back home. <br/><br/>This builds to one of my favourite moments in the film and a scene which I still find astonishing no matter how many times I see it. We have the character of a toy(!) making a serious philosophical decision as to whether it's better to be in contentment or to risk it all by venturing into the unknown. The unknown brilliantly depicted by a long empty elevator shaft. And I love the fact that he chooses the most unlikely option, but then decides he can have it all anyway. This is character development that is absent from most live-action films I've seen. And this is merely' a comedy! This in turn sets up the superb climax at the airport where Woody and Buzz both have to rescue Jesse from a plane that's taxiing down the runway. The fact that it's handled with such aplomb and leaves many live-action action' films floundering in it's wake is only half the trick. It's the way that Pixar manage to incorporate both of Woody's choices; his past (Bullseye) and his present (Buzz) in order for him to effectively save the day.<br/><br/>
Rather than just concentrate on Woody and Buzz, some of the other characters have also been well fleshed out. Rex has his own sub-plot involving Zurg which is well paid off throughout the film. Mr Potato Head gets to adopt a family with Mrs Potato Head! Even Zurg gets his own mysterious past and a wholly unexpected family reunion. Jesse in particular gets to be the huge heart that this film proudly shows off at it's centre. Her past is a sad tale and one which imparts heavily on Woody's decision to stay or to go. She once had an Andy' of her own, but then she grew up and forgot about her toys. This segues into the most moving part of the film, and the only real musical number. I was a bit worried about how they would incorporate a song given that the first film survived without any, bar the opening and end credits. (And I mean of typical Disney numbers where the film effectively stops' until the song is over and the characters sing along). Again, foolish me, In Pixar I Trust. It's a wonderfully emotive song and one that I simply cannot imagine the film without. This is also a very brave decision by Pixar, to show kids that one day they will forget about their toys, and that they will turn into something as horrible and cynical as an adult. Even Woody and Buzz ruminate on what it will be like when Andy forgets about them and provides for me, what I think is the perfect end to the Toy Story saga. Buzz turns to Woody and asks if he's worried about what will happen when Andy grows up and Woody replies that he isn't worried as long as he has old Buzz Lightyear to keep him company, For Infinity And Beyond. In the context of where they are at that point, and what they've gone through, there couldn't have been a more perfect ending. And while I'd love to see more adventures of Woody and Buzz, their wistful little moment is my argument for not making a third Toy Story. We now know that whatever may come along for our heroes, everything will turn out fine. And besides which, how on earth could you top an ending which has Robert Goulet providing the voice for a penguin belting out a Vegas showtune version of You've Got A Friend In Me?!<br/><br/>
Toy Story 2 is a landmark in Western animation, not just for it's dazzling technical achievements but for the care and craftsmanship that's been invested in the story and characters."

"Anonymous_Maxine","9","0","1","21 July 2002"," A strong follow-up to the tremendous 1995 hit, Toy Story, but the sequel is not quite up to the same standards as the original.
","First of all, it should be noted that when I say that Toy Story 2 is not up to the standards of its predecessor, I do not mean the computer animation, which is just as spectacular as it was in 1995, if not better. One of the things that the 1995 version really tried to do (to some extent) was to avoid actually showing human faces. We never see the faces of adults particularly, and the faces of the children that we saw (such as Andy, the vicious Sid, and his pathetic little sister) are obviously animated and do not fit in with the level of reality achieved by the rest of the film. In Toy Story 2, we see a lot more faces, and while they're still never done quite right, it's good to see that they have made a significant improvement in this area.  <br/><br/>In the original Toy Story, we were so fascinated to see a presentation of the real life that we all imagined that our toys had when we were away that that was enough to make a great story for a great film, while in the sequel we are taken a lot deeper into the lives of our toys, which possess a lot more than even the extensive amount of emotion seen in the first film. The toys seem to possess a much deeper sense of neglect than was made clear by their competition over who is the favorite toy in the first movie, and we are even treated to an overly emotional and altogether unnecessary song called `When She Loved Me,' which really only serves to sadden the entire film and slow it down.  <br/><br/>There is an entirely new antagonist presented in the character of Big Al, the toy baron who desperately seeks Woody as the last toy to complete a classic collector set which he is planning on selling for some huge amount of money. We learn about Woody's past in this way, and he is faced with the conflict of staying with his friends (Andy's toys, as well as Andy himself), or returning to what I guess would be called his family, with the unfortunate addition that if he decides to do that, he will remain in a box and be looked at the rest of his existence, never to be played with or loved by a child again. The characters, thankfully, have all returned for the second movie, and we are again treated to a great show of hilarious adventure with them all, including a wonderful scene in which Buzz Lightyear finally encounters the evil Emperor Zurg, which results in a great toy battle scene that plays respectfully (note that, Kevin Smith, RESPECTFULLY) off of the battle between Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader in The Empire Strikes Back.  <br/><br/>The movie is yet another marvel of animation from the people at Pixar, and it does not fail in the least to generate laughs (see, for example, the ultimate result of the battle between Zurg and Buzz). Where the movie goes wrong (and, it should be noted, it goes VERY slightly wrong) is where it tries to insert too much emotion and sadness where it really doesn't belong. It was enough in the first film to see that Woody was so heartbroken as he watched Andy's interest in him begin to fade, but the sequel erroneously thinks that the audience should have tears brought to their eyes, which is just not true.  <br/><br/>But despite being overly emotional, Toy Story 2 captures the wonderful level of adventure and entertainment that made the original film so memorable, and it solidly earns itself a place as one of the great animated films. Fans of the original film are sure to love it, just beware of an excessive amount of emotion presented in the film. It's a comedy with a little too much heart, which makes it a little lop-sided, but the adventure is undeniably strong."

","In the sequel to the groundbreaking Toy Story, Woody, Buzz and the rest of the gang are back for another thrilling adventure. This time Woody is kidnapped by a ruthless toy collector and it's up to his friends to save him before he gets shipped off to Japan and spend the rest of his life behind glass. <br/><br/>There's not much to say about this movie. It was as fast paced and exciting as the original. The only difference is that the thrill and awe you had when you saw the first one is gone, but you still get lost in the movie and forget that it's all animated. If it's possible, the movements and scenery are even better than before. While the human characters still have a little while to go before they look correct, they're getting close. The musical scene with the very sad and touching Sarah McLauchlin song had some incredible images of trees that looked exactly like the real thing. The story was a little more out there than the first one, as this time the toys had to leave the house and venture into the neighborhood to save their friend. But it was still very funny. As in most animated films, the movie moved along at a very fast pace. Something was always going on which is something that doesn't normally happen in live-action films.<br/><br/>
There was also the added treat of seeing Pixar's first animated short, Luxo about two lamps that explained why Pixar has a lamp in their logo. It was cool seeing how the company got started by making an inanimate object become human and then seeing how far they've come with Toy Story 2. So overall, this movie has everything the first one did and some more. It's very exciting and entertaining and good for the whole family. Definitely worth seeing again and again."

","Many times the sequel of a movie is worse then the first one.<br/><br/>Not in this case. In the case of Toy Story, the sequel is better then the first one. Don't get me wrong. Toy Story 1 is a super movie, but Toy Story 2 is even better. <br/><br/>Before I got both movies together on DVDs, I knew that they where movies for kids - but after seeing them, I gotta say, I was wrong. Toy Story 1 and 2 are not only for kids, but for everybody. I am a kid - a 26 year old kid ... at least that's how I feel right now.<br/><br/>I can't remember the last time, when I laughed so much during a movie. There are so many great funny scenes. And all the toys look so cool and nice (over here in Germany, the Mr. Potato Head ain't very popular. But because of Toy Story, I just ordered a Mr. and a Mrs. Potato Head for me)<br/><br/>Also, this movie will tell you some good things about friendship. Just look at the friendship between Woody and Buzz. Or betweeen Woody and Andy. Or between all the other toys. But there are also some tragic moments, like when Jessie tells about her life before she met Woody.<br/><br/>One of the best scenes of the movie was (warning, small spoiler ahead): After the movie, in the closing credits, they showed the outtakes. Like for example: Buzz closes his helmet and you can see that Woody painted a mustache on it ... Watching the entire movie and then watching the outtakes was too much for me. I was laughing so hard, that tears were coming from my eyes. I can't remember the last time that I laughed so hard during a movie.<br/><br/>This movie is already one of my all-time favorite movies."

I (23) saw it with my boyfriend (also 23) and did not have any children with us. It is a 'happy' movie and will leave you laughing till your eyes water. It has ""Simpsons""-like gags and spoofs (I haven't even seen ""Star Wars"" but picked up that spoof at the end) but without the unnecessary sex, violence or offending issues that ""The Simpsons"" has.

Even though it had been over a year since I last saw Toy Story, the excellent character development (that would work well even if you hadn't seen Toy Story ) was fabulous when building on the original.

In fact, it rocks! A good storyline teams up with various cameos from previous Pixar features (including the original Toy Story - e.g the way Buzz gazes up at the new utility-belted Buzz is reminiscent of the way Woody first saw Buzz in the original movie), and even a couple of ripoffs of other movies (Jurassic Park, Star Wars, et al).

Seriously, this is one of the rare instances where the sequal is actually better than the original...though this is meant as no slap at TS1.  The original Toy Story was a very good picture.  But in #2, we find characters showing both greater depth and fresher wit.  Add several brand new characters, along with some unique plot twists, and you have a very solid result.  There simply isn't any weakness here. Here's a thoroughly entertaining and heartwarming movie, without false notes or clinkers.

But Toy Story 2 raises the stakes of these movies...not only intricate computer work, but a good plot.  Woody and Buzz are on a new adventure when a money-greedy toy collector finally completes his collection...let's say, illegally.  The detail in the movie was surprisingly realistic and mind-boggling.  Also, I enjoyed this movie much more than I expected to enjoy it, because it was not too childish, but not too complicated.  Any age could like this movie.  It's action-packed and contains the humor usually thrown in with animated Disney movies.   <br/><br/>One thing that's good about this movie is that it requires no knowledge of the first movie, but the creators assumed that you knew...so if you're a Gemini like my mom, and see Toy Story 2 first, see the first one to enjoy it more."

He's directed all three of Pixar's feature films, and all three have been brilliant.  I, for one, can't wait for his next film.

Not only immensely entertaining, witty and visually impressive, this film incorporates the timeless themes and virtues of individuality, accepting one's identity, bravery, love of family, sacrifice, imagination as well as coming to grips with one's own mortality. It is ironic that a film can be so profound and yet so entertaining.

","After watching numerous sequels, it is very hard to near impossible for a film to be just as good or even better than the original movie. Why?  Well, it's hard to come up with a brand new original script using the same characters and settings.  For Toy Story 2, its task was to bring out the same comedic and amusing personalities back into its old characters with a new good plot and brand new puns and jokes! Toy Story 2 did just that! Plus, the most important of all, it made a great plot to follow up from the original movie that is able to keep the audience entertained.<br/><br/>
The story line works great and how do the people at Pixar & Disney come up with those hilarious gags to fit so well together? It's great script writing where I won't be surprise and hopefully that a 2nd sequel will come out in another 4-5 years.<br/><br/>Of course the plot is important for a sequel, but what else did this movie have that makes the sequel work? Well, it does display the movie as though time has past in-between the first movie.  Andy (Woody & Buzz's owner) and his baby sister looks as though they got about 2-3 years older, plus, new additions to the family and toys were added where the original movie left off. This sequel was made the way sequels are suppose to be made. Unfortunately, very few movies can achieve this goal.

","I was wondering how Toy Story 2 would stack up to it's predecessor , as the first film was both visually incredible as well as being entertaining for both child and adult.  Well this film, in my opinion, not only met such lofty expectations but surpassed them as well.  Once again Pixar has raised the bar for CGI rendered animated films.<br/><br/>Just as the first film gave the viewer a truly three dimensional animated world to see, this one filled in the gaps.  Thanks to exponential advances in computer technology, TS 2 is even more visually stunning than the first. There is more detail everywhere.  From the expressions on the faces of the human characters, to the dust that has settled on ""the shelf"", the animators have set a new standard.<br/><br/>But what makes this film a joy is a very well written script and screenplay as well as a lot of humor for both child and adult.  One of my favorite parts in the film is when Buzz is fighting in the toy store with another Buzz Lightyear who is still caught up in the idea that he is a ""real Buzz Lightyear"".  In this fight Buzz says ""was I really this delusional?"".  The re-introducing of this sub-plot into the story was not only innovative but it put an original twist on it.  Very clever.<br/><br/>All in all I would say that this is a superb film, exceeding the first one. I would recommend it to anyone, young or old.  Go see it.

Pixar is no longer the little studio that could, it's a major studio with major players that produces QUALITY films and all on a few hundred computers amazing.  Now if they could only lose the Disney name. My favorite part was the airplane rescue, hanging from the front landing gear, almost forgot it was a cartoon.

I saw it full of adults and kids.  the adults were wetting themselves laughing.  the kids were just sitting there,sure they were making noise, but it was no ""A Bugs Life"" reaction, which was huge.

"DoobieKeebler","10","0","1","28 November 1999"," a very entertaining experience
","""Toy Story 2"" is definitely as good of a movie as I expected.  It is simply a magnificent follow-up to the genius of the original ""Toy Story.""  It's refreshing to know that they still make quality movies like this that the whole family can enjoy.  ""Toy Story 2"" is funny, smart, energetic, very imaginative, and definitely an enjoyable adventure.  The characters are all witty and likable.  The story is strong, it is clear that a lot of thought went into making a solid sequel, rather than just some money-making trash film.  Disney and Pixar have done it again with a third success of a film. It definitely lives up to expectations and it is just so unique in a number of ways.  Everyone in the family will enjoy it, as the movie is geared to entertain people of all ages.  The film is very close to being as good as the original; the music isn't quite as good as the first Toy Story, and the idea isn't as original as it was in 1995.  But ""Toy Story 2"" is an outstanding moviegoing experience, one of the best I've had in years.  It is just such an appealing film that gives me hope that the movie industry isn't going completely downhill.  This is one of the best sequels ever, living up to the original as only a few sequels (such as ""Ghostbusters II"") have. The animation is just as unbelievable as ""Toy Story.""  Tim Allen and Tom Hanks do indeed have a presence beyond physical appearance as their characters' voices reflect the actors themselves.  (When Buzz says ""Boy, I could really use one of those utility belts"", think Tim Taylor.)  All in all, one of the greatest, most refreshing films of recent years.  I recommend everyone to see it!"

Not to many sequels are better than the original, but to me, this one is. <br/><br/>The movie expands nicely on Woodie's past, Buzz's future, and experiments more with toy fun. Wayne Knight adds with his toy collectors role.<br/><br/>Get this rest of Hollywood: you can make a meaningful movie, slip a few innunendos past censors, eliminate profanity, give families something view do together, and make $200million (I think you will anyway)."
"NarfMan","10","0","1","28 November 1999"," The Toys are better than ever
","Don't be confused by the number.  Toy Story 2 is anything but a sequel. Sequels are continuations of original stories, but though the use of unoriginal ideas, a lack of enjoyable twists, rehashes moments from the original, and about half the original cast.  Toy Story 2 is actually an extention of the original.  It's breathes with the life of one of the most wonderful story ever created as an afterthought.<br/><br/>Now, a little background for those of you who are behind.  In 1995, Disney, in association with Pixar, released the first fully computer-animated feature film, Toy Story.  The plot was a hilarious buddy comedy about toys, mainly Woody, the cowboy (Tom Hanks) and Buzz Lightyear, the new spaceman toy (Tim Allen).  After some rivally and an adventure where Buzz realizes that he's a toy, the two become best friends.<br/><br/>This time around, it's Woody who's in for the surprise of a lifetime. He's priceless.  Literally.  He's a collectors item; A rare doll based of the 50's tv show character from ""Woody's Round-Up"".  When Woody tries to rescue Wheezy from the Yard Sale, he ends up getting stolen by Al (Wayne Knight), owner of ""Al's Toy Barn"".  Thus, it's up to Buzz, Rex (Wallace Shaw), Slinky Dog (Jim Varney), Mr. Potato Head (Don Rickles), and Hamm (John Ratzenberger) to go on an another adventure through the city, the toy store, a skyscraper, the airport, and even a car chase (real car, not RC).<br/><br/>Overall, this movie rings as good as the original, or even debatably better.  Just compare it to the Star Wars Episode IV and V fight or the Godfather I and II fight.   Each time the following movie actually seems to be better.  Toy Story 2 is proud to become an elitist member of those few movies.  The animation seemed to be superior thanks to newer computer technology.  And the story itself was both touching without ever going near preachy.  When Buzz says his speech about saving his friend, Woody cause that's what Woody did for him, that's all he says.  No lingering.  Just keep moving on.<br/><br/>Odd little fact here: Toy Story 2 almost went the way of ""Simba's Pride"" and ""Return of Jafar"", direct to home video.  However, unlike those two, this movie was destined for the big screen and I applause Disney for giving it another shot.  I am, however, gonna go nuts waiting for the video or the ""dare-I-say-it?"" DVD release.<br/><br/>The thing that caught me off guard was the action sequences.  Each one sucked me in deeper than anything I've seen in a long time.  The opening scene depicts Buzz Lightyear's very own video game as an intense action fight between him and the evil Emperor Zurg.  It's later recreated in an elevator shaft with more whimsical and comical results.  As for the climax, a tense piece of work on a airplane, I've never felt more nervous for a pair of pixelated pals in my entire life.  It's momently like those that make me anxiously await the Buzz Lightyear TV show that might be coming soon. (Take that Reboot and Beast Wars.)<br/><br/>As for the characters themselves, they all were as great as the last time if they were in it the last time.  Hamm just continues being an extension of Ratzenberger's already perfected Cliff Claven from ""Cheers"".  Shawn's Rex as a video game freak just fits the character so perfectly, it's a wonder it wasn't thought of for the original.  Woody and Buzz are still the preemo centerpiece character's and even if their together time is minimal in this one, you still gotta love the goofy two.<br/><br/>As for the new character's, they're all lacking.  The main new character is the cowgirl Jessie (Joan Cusack) and she's as dull as a school-board debate. The only time you care for her is during the emotional new song by Sarah McLaughlin, otherwise, you just want her screen time to end.  As for the others, Mrs. Potato Head was put in only because she was referenced in the ending to the last one, Bo Peep is still playing fifteenth banana after the Etch-A-Sketch, and as great as it is to see Barbie in the movie, it wonders if Mattel will be happy with the end result (a dopey bimbo who's as plastic as ""BarbieGirl"" makes her out to be).<br/><br/>But I guess what makes Toy Story 2 truly great are all the jokes. Especially the gags that are hidden all over the place.  Most people caught a few obvious ones in the first movie (""Hakuna Matata"" in the car, a Mickey Clock on Andy's wall) and missed the more subtle ones (the toolbox in Sid's room is by Binford, as in ""Home Improvement"").  This movie is no exception. First, there is the new addition to Andy's room, ""A Bug's Life"" calendar on the wall.  And then a delicious parody of ""Jurrasic Park' T-Rex tailing the car in the rear-view mirror.  And finally, the ultimate rip on Star Wars ever.  I'm not even gonna hint you about it.  This is one joke that must throw you off guard to be truly appreciated it.<br/><br/>Thus, in the end, I recommend this one to anyone who's a fan of toys, classic stories, great action sequences, wonderful jokes, and of course, the original story.  Now, call me a nit-picker but some of the computer effects are just too shiny when compared to the original.  But hey, who am I to critizise Pixar?  I have a hard enought time using paintbrush on my computer.  Catch this movie the moment you can.  Masterpieces like this movie must be treasures.  I only wish Pixar could work twice as hard to create new movies as I anxiously await the next title by them, the currently titled ""Monsters, Inc.""  All I ask for is one thing: hey guys, while you're at it, ""Toy Story 3?"""
"MetroRev","8","0","1","29 November 1999"," If you liked the first one...
","This is a simple one to comment on.  Toy Story 2 is more of the same without the burdens that come with being more of the same. The animation has gone to new heights as expected.  There are scenes in this film that appear as real as anything.  specifically take a look at when ""Al"" is sleeping.  The stubble on his chin and the cheat-O cheese on his fingers looks amazing. The story is simple but touching.  The friendship between ""Buzz,"" (Tim Allen) and ""Woody,"" (Tom Hanks) has a great feel to it and the two voice actors interact well together.  The humor is crisp and works on many levels and for those people who enjoy Star Wars there are references throughout to the Holy Trilogy.  <br/><br/>Overall as good as the first.

There is a scene where the new Buzz has his belt disappear.

"meet_the_feebles","10","0","1","14 April 2002"," One of the ONLY animated FILMS ever!
","There is a rule in the movie world that some things are MOVIES and some are FILMS. Movies are just there to make money or fail at making any points or sharing any real ideas. Films are there to inspire and challenge the today you are in, or add thought to what would otherwise be a movie. Toy Story 1 was on the boarder of Movie and Film, I believe it to be a movie more than a film. However Toy Story 2 is no question a film. It's about growing up and moving on from a parent's point of view. But what makes it a film is it's inspiring touches that make it about what the viewer thinks it's about. As I think it's about how one should live there life before they die. Should they worry about what happens when you die? Should they try to preserve themselves by joining a group of people and living in a glass case? Or should they love and share love with whomever excepts it? Well our hero is faced with all three but chooses (wisely) the love theme.<br/><br/>Woody is worried about Andy (his owner) throwing him away when he gets his first rip. He's afraid Andy will discard him since he is now a broken toy. (I guess this could relate in many ways to how adults fear their children will put them in nursing homes when their old and crazy). Woody then meets a group of toys that form a complete collection with him. This collection is rare and when assembled will be cased in a glass box for viewing only. (This sounds like religion in how it tells everybody to stay away from any fun they might have and makes them with fear.) This fear is very real in Woody as he is a broken toy and now knows he can't play (live) forever. After some really fun sense their is a point when Buzz Lightyear (Woody's counter part.) gives a speech about how isn't it better that Woody enjoy his limited time with Andy and have a neverending storybook of memories than to trap himself in a box where kids can look at him but the memories will be limited. This rings a bell with every parent. I could go on and on with reasons why Toy Story 2 is the greatest animated film to date, and will probably (like Beauty and the Beast) hold up for years and decades to come. **** (out of ****)"

","This rare sequel is a great movie unto itself. That is so uncommon with sequels, it should get an Oscar in a new, special category-- just for being as good as the original. Moreover, it intelligently portrayed the characters and the movie's ""world"" in a truly sequence fashion. That is, in a plausible universe where situations develop and grow, ""Toy Story 2"" actually shows what one might expect a few months later (from the supposed time of of events in ""Toy Story,"" the first movie).<br/><br/>So often sequels smell like desperate movie business deals-- adding in ridiculous and artificial complications and dangers, and emphasizing ""shtick"" that the producers think the audience loved about the original. This shtick-- tag lines and quirky mannerisms-- then become fodder for billions of fast-food drink cups, and endless TV commercials that grind every last bit of potential pleasure that might have been gleaned from the movie into the dirt and dust. So often, a sequel only manages to undo the pedigree of the original.<br/><br/>Not so here--  ""Toy Story 2"" is a great movie, with or without the first; yet it also adds value and enjoyment to the first film.

But while everyone has fallen under the Shrek bug, I believe Toy Story 2 (which I saw for the first time after I saw Shrek) is still the best CGI film to date. While I did laugh at some of the barage of parodies in Shrek, and smiled a little even during the gross and even questionable scenes, Toy Story 2 is still leaps and bounds ahead in story, character development and just overall fun.<br/><br/>I love Toy Story, don't get me wrong, you have to give credit to the first full length CGI movie, but with Toy Story it was ""Ok, let's make the first CGI film"" with Toy Story 2 it's ""Ok, let's make the greatest CGI film."" One thing that I think Pixar is the best at when it comes to CGI is character emotions. You can see any still from a Pixar film and know immediatly what that character is feeling. Even toys with limited movement, such the dinosaur Rex or Mr. Potato head, have so much personality. Heck, I know what the Etch-e-Sketch is thinking. When Jessie tells her story, it the most emotional scenes I've seen in any CGI movie.<br/><br/>Toy Story 2 has it share of pop-culture references, most obvious is the paralellism between Woody's Round Up and the Howdy Doody Show, and the Star Wars spoof. But they blend into the story well. And some kids movies have a tendancy to have a gross factor to get laughs, but Toy Story 2 is funny without being gross.<br/><br/>I like other CGI films like Shrek, Final Fantasy, Dinosaur, but what really makes this films is how much personality every character has. They're toys, and not even that, just animated toys, but you will be surprised how much to feel for them."

","I am talking about the ""dancing Barbies scene"" which I believe was inspired by <i>Valley of the Dolls</i>. I just want to comment that this probably was the strongest ""sex reference"" in a Disney cartoon, not counting Jessica Rabbit's behavior. I mean, traditionally Disney characters never get sexually attracted at feminine bodies. On the other hand, it is debatable how those seven dwarves exactly felt about Snow White.<br/><br/>Of course I enjoyed it. After all, I remember finding Barbie dolls in friend's houses and taking the clothes off.<br/><br/>The rest of the movie was pretty good, including Buzz Lightyear's space hero dialogue which I've always enjoyed."

","There are many movies that come with a sequel that aren't nearly as good as the original. There are few exceptions to when it comes to the sequel being better than the original. For instance, after being in the Godfather Part II many people said it was better than the original. I haven't seen any of The Godfather's so I can't say which is better. Many people may hate for this, but I thought Mission: Impossible 2 was better than the original, although they were very different movies, so it was hard to be compared. Toy Story 2, I would have to say is the best sequel I've ever seen. It was better than the original for many reasons. It had a better story line, and it had better action too. There was much more adventure to it. Last, but not least, there were new characters also. There were many funny parts in this movie, especially with the cones. Buzz, I'm your father. I'm going to play catch with my dad. It was a riot, this movie. I can't believe it got an 8.4 rating too. It deserved it though. One person said, Some Like it Hot was better than this. I didn't see what was so funny about that movie.<br/><br/>
 The plot of this movie is simply this. Woody discovers that he is a very rare toy from the fifties who was a hot seller. The reason he knows is a rare toy is because he was ""toynapped"" by the owner of AL'S TOY BARN. The reason he was kidnapped is because, he was going to shipped off to a toy museum in Japan, with his round up Jesse and Stinky Pete and the donkey. The owner by the name of Al, will make big bucks for finding this rare toy. As soon as Buzz, Rex, Ham, and Slinky Dog, see that he is gone, they go for the rescue. Many things will happen in this all new adventure, which I will not tell you. See the movie for yourself.<br/><br/> Overall this an awesome movie, especially for Disney. It was much better than the original like I said before. Toy Story 2 deserves 10/10. I hope they come out with Toy story 3."

When we pick up the story in ""Toy Story 2,"" Buzz Lightyear is in outer space where he meets his arch-nemesis, Emperor Zurg.<br/><br/>Buzz flies through caverns, enters Zurg's stronghold, and gets defeated (gasp) by the evil Zurg! Is this the end of our hero?....Nah, it's just Rex playing the Buzz Lightyear video game and losing. It is Yard Sale Day and the toys are understandably tense. You see, Yard Sale Day means that the old toys go out to the sale. Woody has reason to be nervous, he's starting to show his age. He's got a ripped arm thanks to Andy's dog, whom we got introduced to at the end of the first Toy Story. Sure enough, one of the toy troop gets taken. Poor Weezie the Penguin was laid forgotten on Andy's bookcase and he promptly gets put in the sale box. It's up to Woody to save him, which he does. But he gets picked up by a greedy toy-collector named Al and taken to Al's Toy Barn. Seems Woody is pretty valuable and Al wants to sell him to a toy auction.

Mr. Potato Head sees temptation incarnate in some friendly Barbies (""I'm a married spud!

Not so much for epicness, but for how the story gets deeper and richer as it goes along.

","Creating a sequel to one of the most original and enduring family favourites of the nineties was always going to be a risky business  just ask the producers of 'Babe: Pig In The City'. And, what with established characters, million-dollar merchandising and the likes of Tom Hanks on board, it would not have been entirely surprising if this latest Disney sequel had suffered from complacency. So how refreshing it is to find that 'Toy Story 2' is just as vibrant, innovative, and relentlessly entertaining as its predecessor.<br/><br/>Reuniting the original cast  Woody, Buzz, Mr. Potato Head et al, plus a few new additions  with co-director Lasseter and his creative cohorts at Pixar, the ingenious plot involves the kidnapping of Woody by a ghoulish toy collector determined to sell him to a museum, and the other toys' hilarious attempts at a rescue mission. Discovering the secrets of his past along the way (it turns out he was once the star of a 50s TV show, Woody's Roundup', lovingly recreated for our pleasure), the cowboy has to face a brace of poignant moral dilemmas  most specifically, whether he should sacrifice an extended shelf-life to be with his friends and his owner Andy. Whilst the animation is never allowed to detract from the characters and the story, some of the new graphics are breathtaking; the human and canine characters are now nearly as authentic at the toys themselves, and, as before, every frame has been carefully attended to - no texture, shadow or background detail is left unchecked and parts of the movie (not least the dazzling finale) are strikingly, invigoratingly visual. <br/><br/>Fans of the original will no doubt be left wanting to see more of the three-eyed green creatures, who continually steal every scene they're in, and the contributions of Randy Newman - whose original songs so helped to define the whole feel of the first film - are sadly limited to one gooey flashback sequence and a couple of reprises of You've Got A Friend In Me'. But 'Toy Story 2' has rounded, loveable characters, staggeringly well-crafted set-pieces, and, perhaps most impressively, moments of genuine pathos - whilst the rapid and cross-generational humour is of a calibre hardly ever achieved by live-action movies. If you're not smiling by the time you leave the cinema or turn off that video, there is something clinically wrong with you."
"doc-55","10","0","1","24 May 2001"," A welcome surprise: No letdown!
","Maltin's assessment hits the target exactly: if anything, this tops the entertaining first outing of Buzz and Woody. The first had as its focus a rather contrived rivalry and reconciliation between the two, which seldom made one forget these were only inanimate toys; this one somehow makes one almost suspend  disbelief in the stronger characterizations of the two ""leads"" and the supporting cast; and in the development of the symbiotic relationship between toys and their owners, much like that of pets and owners. The rapid alternation of the toys between movement/speech and stasis whenever a human looks their way was very impressive. The garage sale signs and the box dumped behind the Goodwill type truck I found very touching. A particular ""kick"" for me was ""Guide Barbie"" in the toy store and the chorus line of Barbies behind the penguin in the last number. Perhaps it's my male bias, but I found it rewarding to note the Barbie shallowness as compared with the lifelike personalities of the other toys."

","I missed both Toy Story 1 and 2 in the theaters, but recently have seen both on video.  These two movies are truly treasures of the animation age.  I have never before been so amused and entertained by a children's movie.  It is difficult to say if the sequel is better than the original because they are both so wonderful.  I love the spin on Woody and Buzz's friendship in the sequel so that Buzz has to save Woody just as his friend did for him earlier.  The characters are all so lively and brighten up a simple toy design that they were created from.  The new characters that belonged to Woody's Roundup were great and hilarious.  It takes quite a bit to get me to cry in a movie, but somehow every time I see the part where Jessie delves into her past with Emily to the tune of ""When She Loved Me,"" I can't keep a dry eye!  Once again, as with the original, the little three-eyed aliens steal the show.  What a fun movie for both kids and adults...

"Darth_Stat","Null","0","1","8 April 2001"," The greatest Disney flick by far and a top of all-timer.
","One gets to thinking that they deliberately refined the original in order to have a superior sequel. It is hard to compare the entertainment value of the original to this one, it's the classic sequel thing certainly, more and better of everything, up the stakes and down slowness. This one is an absolute delight to watch from beginning to end, more humour, more action, more characters, more locations and it is really hard to fault.<br/><br/>
This time it is Woody that goes missing so you get to see Buzz in all his glory hit the town with one-liners and gadgets galore. He's not alone though. Instead of having three locations to follow, Woody, Buzz and back home, they hop everyone on the band wagon and really explore the idea of living toys wandering around the streets, in buildings and elevators, air vents, cars, trucks, airports and air planes and they couldn't resist including my No. 2 hope for the sequel which is having two Buzz Lightyears about the place, my No. 1 hope they also carried out, having Buzz take on the previously mentioned Arch rival, Emperor Zerg, with some references throughout the movie to all the favourite box office hits, Star Wars to a huge extent, Jurassic Park, Forrest Gump and a heap more. It's a pretty evident crowd pleaser formula but entertainment is what these movies are all about. Since I got this one on video I havn't touched the original.<br/><br/>You definitely will not be disappointed with this movie. I hardly had a Disney favourites heirachy untill this one, it's original was there at 1. And the critics and global audience agreed with us as this movie took its totally unexpected No. 3 of the year rank, beating out the Heartthrob adventure flick, The Mummy, the by account standardised Disney flick Tarzan and the lavishly effected Sunnies and leather Teen-flick The Matrix. That year was all about remakes and sequels was'nt it.

","I am a huge fan of the first Toy Story, I thought that movie was just brilliant, although there was something lacking, I don't know what that was, but there was something not quite complete about it. That's where the next installment comes in.<br/><br/>This next Story is mostly about Woody. When Andy's mother decides to get rid of Woody because his arm is ""broken"", he is picked up by a toy collector who recognizes him as a collector's item from way back. Woody is ""kidnapped"" by the collector and the rest of the toys decide to undertake an expedition to rescue him. Fairly straightforward up until now.<br/><br/>But that's where the movie starts to pick up the pace and with rollercoaster speed the story unfolds and with it the characters blossom. It felt like watching The Empire Strikes Back all over again after having loved Star Wars so much. The characters all seems to become these living figures with problems and worries. Woody has to come to terms with his past, Buzz has to battle himself and find out that there are loads and loads more like him, Mr. Potato Head is married now, Rex has his quest with the Buzz Lightyear video game (""My claws are too short!!!"") etc etc. Even the aliens are coming to reprise their role. Too much to tell here.<br/><br/>But the most wonderful thing in part two are the additions. Woody's forgotten rooting-tooting wild west gang is hilarious. Jessie, in particular, is fantastic. With the voice of Joan Cusack as her backbone she becomes the one to make Woody realize that without him the gang is doomed to spent another lifetime ""in storage"". Her song, written by Randy Newman and sung by Sarah McLaughlin, about her former owner losing interest in her was heart-breaking. Woody's horse is the new comic-relief, and plays this part to excellence. Stinky Pete (with the voice of Kelsey ""Frasier"" Grammer) is wonderful in his own devious kind of way. Another ""addition"" to the story is Zurg, already glimpsed in the original movie in text, now he becomes ""flesh and blood"" and has a terrible secret to reveal to one of the other Buzzes. Wayne Knight (Newman from Seinfeld) gives just the right frantic toy-collector nerdy feel to Al, owner of the toyshop and abductor of Woody to complete his collection of Woody's gang to sell them to someone in Japan. All in all a lot of new wonderful characters that you can feast your eyes on.<br/><br/>The worst thing that happened to me while watching this movie was that the performances were so convincing, by the gang in particular, that I started to feel guilty about myself having toys (Star Wars) still inside the packaging. A horrible feeling crept over me, and I almost wanted to go home and rip open all the packaging and set the toys free from storage. I managed to restrain myself just in time not to ruin my valuable collection (horrible me).<br/><br/>I absolutely love and adore this movie, I want everybody who has a shred of human decency and love in their body to go out and rent this gem (although it is mandatory that you watch the first to set up the characters). A must see for everybody.<br/><br/>10/10<br/><br/>PS. Please stay for the credits, these are hilarious.

","Well, what can I say? If every cartoon sequel that is ever made is scripted and executed HALF as good as this, the world will be a better place. Instead of just rehashing all the good stuff from the original for another wheeze around the track, all the characters and the premises were expanded and enhanced. Stuff like ""Mrs. Potato Head"", ""Al's Toy Barn"", and ""Emperor Zurg"", which could have been throwaway material, are given lives of their own.<br/><br/>The entire original cast is reassembled, and several talented new members are introduced. Kelsey Grammer brings a large range of emotions to the Prospector, from dignity to indignance to his final insanity. Wheezy the penguin inspires our deepest sympathies. Mrs. Potato Head is HILARIOUS! Her dialogue with her husband is some of the best written. And Bullseye the horse: he succeeds in being absolutely ADORABLE without turning the stomach in the slightest. Emperor Zurg is a little disappointing (his design, his lack of personality, the missed opportunity of his thinking he is a toy, etc.), however.<br/><br/>The visuals have been bumped up more than a notch. Notice how the people no longer look like they are made of clay, and compare the almost photo-realistic dog to the leather jacket with fangs in the original.<br/><br/>However, I have a few misgivings. The first is the character of Jessie. When she first appeared, I thought: she'll stop acting like this any minute. But she didn't. Ever.<br/><br/>The second is graver. Since this movie, there are a lot of ""Woody's Roundup"" and ""Buzz Lightyear at Star Command"" spinoffs. I hate this because they force us to see Buzz and Woody as REAL MEN, rather than toys. Uncomfortable? You should be. Not to mention the continuity problems (how would Buzz not recognize the little aliens in the first film, when it is revealed that they do all the grunt work at Star Command) created.<br/><br/>Then there's all that picky stuff (Rocky and Bo Peep have not been developed at all, how old is Woody, how long did it take HIM to realize he is a toy rather than a cowboy, why didn't ALL the ""Roundup"" toys come to life, how could the collection be complete when Woody is missing his gun, etc.).<br/><br/>Overall, however, and excellent film for EVERYBODY to see. You won't be disappointed. I'm stoked for the third edition, but I wouldn't want to see anybody replacing the great Jim Varney.<br/><br/>P.S. I just might be crazy, but is it possible that Emily, who owned Jessie all those years ago, is Andy's mother? She's the right age, and it would certainly add another layer to the scene in which she adamantly refuses to sell Woody to Al."

","And that quote in my summary, above, is the whole essence of ""Toy Story 2"". This happens during an encounter in the toy store where Woody has to decide whether to go to Japan with his ""sidekicks"" and be admired through plexiglass by millions, or stay with Andy as he grows up and eventually discards his toys. Woody has decided to go to Japan.<br/><br/>The story starts with Andy going to camp and Woody being left behind because of a rip in his right shoulder stitching. Mom throws a yard sale, and picks the penguin to sell. As Woody rescues him, with the help of the family pup, Woody falls off and is stolen by a dishonest local toy store owner who had been looking for an original ""Woody"" to complete his set. Including Jessie (Joan Cusack), Stinky Pete (Kelsey Grammer) and the horse. Jessie does a nice song, voiced by Sarah Maclaughlin.<br/><br/>This is a very fun movie, the allure being the various ""chase scenes"" and narrow escapes - the toys commandeering a vehicle, crossing the busy intersction under hazard cones, the elevator sequence, the airport baggage sequence, the daring runway escape from the jetliner baggage compartment. Animation and dialog are great all the way through. The central message is good, that cooperation, loyalty, and ""family"" are important to happiness. However, that theme and exciting action and escape sequences are now the central ingredient in all successful animated films of late.<br/><br/>Still, my favorite ""animated"" film is Disney's ""Tarzan"", followed by ""A Bug's Life"" and the clay-mation ""Chicken Run"", then ""Toy Story 2.""  All of them are great, and a ""favorite"" comes down to personal preference. I rate ""Toy Story 2"" an ""8"" of 10, and I certainly don't think it deserves #30 all-time, which is where it currently sits on the Imdb."

","The follow-up to 1995's masterpiece, ""Toy Story 2"" manages to compliment the striking execution of the original while opening up the emotional depth the first film exhibited so successfully. The plot is cleaner than the original (Woody the Cowboy is kidnapped by a greedy toy store owner to complete a set being shipped to a Japanese museum for megabucks) but the conflicts that arise are more complex (Woody is torn between two loyalties: his friends at home and his reunited family; and the toys are made to realize their mortality as their owners grow up and discard them) and the satire more profound (collectibles as pure profit centers). The sublime voice cast of the first is reunited here (Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, Wallace Shawn, Annie Potts, John Ratzenberger, Jim Varney, Don Rickles, Laurie Metcalf) but the addition of Wayne Knight, Kelsey Grammer and especially Joan Cusack (as Jessie, Woody's sidekick little sister) is equally as fantastic. In short, a sequel that more than holds its own--how often can you say that?"

Woody gets kidnapped and it's up to Buzz, Slinky Dog, Rex, Mr. Potatohead, and Ham to get him back.   We also get a glimpse of what a toy must feel like when they're discarded and no longer played with. Sitting up on shelf for viewing only is a pretty lonely existence for a toy.

","When Pixar brought the original Toy Story out in 1995, many people were stunned at the quality of the movie. This was no mere theatrical release. It looked like live action, but it was all done on a computer (or, more precisely, many computers). The toys looked staggeringly real. They looked not like cartoon characters but what you might find on the floor of a kid's unkempt room. And what's more, they had more life than most characters played by real-life actors. <br/><br/>A standard axiom of animated feature films says that the greater the original, the lesser the sequel. The higher the roman or arabic numeral after the title, the worse the quality will be. There have been sequels to Snow White, The Jungle Book, Aladdin, The Lion King, and others that were measurably worse than the original films. It's a pattern as old as movies themselves, and of course it applies to live-action movies as well. In general - good original = bad sequel; great original = so-so sequel.<br/><br/>And this is where Toy Story 2 breaks the rules. Ah, those folks at Pixar (and, of course, at Disney). While the original took place largely in Andy's room, the second film wanders out into the streets of the city - and even to a toy store! All of the gang is back from the first one, including the late Jim Varney as Slinky Dog. What's the plot? Woody (Tom Hanks) is swiped from Andy's front yard (he wasn't supposed to be sold, don't fret!) by a toy-store owner (Wayne Knight) looking to cash in on Woody's value as a collectible. Naturally, the other toys, led by Buzz Lightyear, launch a rescue mission. But does Woody want to be rescued? We're introduced to three new characters, the other dolls in a collectible set from a long-ago TV show. You know, kind of like Howdy Doody, only everyone was a marionette. With Woody completing the set, these toys are to be sold to a Japanese museum. Will Woody go with his new friends and live in a museum, or will he return with Buzz and company to stay with Andy?<br/><br/>The movie introduces some wonderful, thought-provoking material. Kids will be entertained by the exploits of Woody and his friends, but they'll learn without knowing they're being taught, and that might be the most effective way for kids to learn lessons anyway. For example, Woody has a moral dilemma - go or stay - and while he resolves it diplomatically, he doesn't (or the screenwriters don't) take the easy way out. Also, our old pal Buzz seems to have matured since the last movie (!) and has his OWN dilemma to deal with. We see these toys' frailities, and it makes them so real to us. Kids see them and identify with the toys. We don't just have superheroes saving the day from evil. We have toys that might just as well be the children themselves, and you have to admire the verisimilitude of the script itself. It's a script that's racuously funny, with some references only the adults will get, and deliciously crisp - it's not a carbon-copy plot."

","After viewing the first one I must say I was not sure this film would be good, since I thought the original, Toy Story, was an average film. But I thought: Hey it is Disney, so how bad can it be?' And guess what I was right. This is a good movie and in my opinion a better one than the first, but after seeing this one I'm sure I'm going to watch the original again in the near future.<br/><br/>
What I really liked about this movie, was that it was not only pretty funny (especially Rex the dinosaur and Buzz Lightyear) but that there was plenty of action, excitement and last but not least a lot of emotion. It really showed us, especially young kids, how many of treat our toys. This movie is a good reason to hold on to all of your old stuff or give it away to other children and not just to throw it away, for it will be of great emotional value to you some day too. But this is not just a kids movie. Adults will enjoy this one too, because of some great jokes involving movies (the Star Wars stuff was really hilarious). Of course not everything was great. I especially liked Woody, Rex and Buzz, but there was also one irritating little character and that one was the Cowgirl Jessie, she was just too happy and that made her annoy me sometimes, but hey, characters are different and you need not like everybody and Jessie being irritating did not cause me not wanting Woody to help her so there is just one more thing for me to say: WELL DONE Disney, the Toy story keeps getting better and I'm already looking forward to Toy Story 3.<br/><br/>

In Al's apartment, Woody discovers that he's actually the star of a kid's show called ""Woody's Roundup"" and meets his Roundup gang, Jessie the cowgirl, Bullseye the horse, and Stinky Pete. Woody is now faced with a dillema: Should he stay with the Roundup gang and end up in a museum to be immortalized forever, or go back to his beloved Andy, who will probably discard him as he grows to adulthood?<br/><br/>Toy Story 2 is just as entertaining and visually astounding as its predecessor, but its exploration into serious topics such as facing one's own mortality and the loss of innocence in the process of growing up makes it a superior film. Jessie's heartbreaking tale of abandonment is made clear in the song ""When She Loved Me"", beautifully sung by Sarah McLachlan. It's a shame that it did not win the Oscar for best song.<br/><br/>Although, the movie ends with the typical Disney happy ending, there is a twinge of sadness, as the toys must face the fact that their days with Andy are numbered. Woody puts it best when he says that ""it will be fun while it lasts."" The ultimate message of this movie is that life is short, and we must never lose the spark, that sense of awe and wonder that we had as children."

The first one was about an exciting adventure, but not to the extent of the second one. I love these sorts of emotional journey/adventure movies, especially when Disney does them. The part where Jessie sings about Emily is a tear-jerker! They didn't have anything quite like that in the first Toy Story. But I do recommend that if you're going to watch TS2 for the first time (which is probably no one 'cause everyone's seen it already), that you watch the original again first to have everything fresh in your mind. There are a lot of references to it in the second movie, that won't be nearly as funny if you've forgotten those things in the first. It will maximize your enjoyment of Toy Story 2."

Woody, Buzz Lightyear and friends have returned and their exploits are even more imaginative and breathtakingly realised than in the first film. <br/><br/>Woody (voiced by Tom Hanks again) and Buzz (Tim Allen) are now good mates and so when the diminutive cowboy is toynapped by greedy collector Al McWhiggin (3rd Rock's Wayne Knight) Buzz and the rest of the toys  Mr Potato Head (now married), Rex, Hamm and Slinky Dog  are duty bound to rescue him. <br/><br/>Woody, meanwhile, has discovered that he was once the hero of an old children's TV show. He joins his old show-mates Jessie (Joan Cusack), an over-enthusiastic cowgirl, and Stinky Pete (Kelsey Grammer, better known as Frasier), a grouchy old prospector. If he leaves them their collection won't be complete and they'll be put back in storage instead of being put on display in Japan. <br/><br/>Far from being simplistic or patronising, Toy Story 2 is intelligently plotted, fast-moving and full of movie in-jokes to keep the older members of the audience entertained. The animation has been improved and the humans now look far more realistic. A whole host of beautiful effects for things like leaves, bubbles and dust add to the impression of painstaking care taken over the entire project. Far more impressive, though, is the level of characterisation in each and every toy. From the melancholy penguin with the broken squeaker to Woody's faithful steed, Bullseye, they are consistently funny and often quite moving. <br/><br/>Toy Story 2 is a triumph over standard ideas of sequels and children's films being less successful or engaging than more conventional blockbuster material. It is witty, emotional and brilliantly made with the highest attention to detail possible  witness the 'out-takes' during the credits. How many films will you be able to say that about this year?"

This time Woody isn't in the confrontation he was with Buzz Lightyear (favorites), but this time he has too choose between going old and his master Andy throwing him away, or living forever in a museum. Like other Pixar films, this isn't just a moral choice and lesson for kids, it's interesting for adults too (adults and kids alike will enjoy the puns with old toys, quotes and characters) because it is a decision that though is colored over, has a deep meaning in life.<br/><br/>But, unfortunately bad because like most sequels, the first is in this case is better. It isn't by much, but mostly in the means of comedy (some of the humor in this film is just *too* silly, while the first maintained a better pace with its jokes and gags). Don't worry though, it isn't all bad, but I just feel some sequels aren't as livable to their precedors.

And, sure, the animation was impressive, but we have to review movies for what they are, right?<br/><br/>                              Therefore, the sequel surprised me like no other movie.<br/><br/>                              Toy Story 2 mixes some usual children's humour, most of it in the beginning, and ''real'' laughs, making it charming and entertaining like no other movie.

Toy Story 2 is a movie for all ages. Really!<br/><br/>                              The characters are entertaining and no one is annoying. Some of the highlights (they are many) is definitely the encounter with Buzz Lightyear and another Buzz-action hero who really think he is a space hero, the car stop at the Barbie-section and the great ending scene at the airport. Like other sequels to movies like ''Home Alone'' and ''Austin Powers'' this sequel is not a remake of the original, where all the jokes has been easily uppdated and refreshed. Every lack the first movie had has been smoothely fixed up and the movie has a heart, wich, in my opinion, the original missed.<br/><br/>                              The adventure in the movie is a whole lot more entertaining than before, and it is a whole lot funnier than ''Toy Story''.

","When I found out that Disney and Pixar were making ""Toy Story 2"" I was happy but I thought that it wouldn't be as good as the original, but I was wrong. When I went to see it with my family I was very excited. When it was over I asked what my family thought of it. My dad loved it, he thought it was as good as the first so did my mom, and so did my brother(Pizzagena) I thought it was excellent, I was surprised that it was as good, but I did not think it was better than the first. I think that they are both equal. So, I would say that I give ""Toy Story 2"" a good ***1/2."
"Texasguy","10","0","1","28 March 2000"," The Perfect Studio Film!
","1999 was undoubtedly one of the greatest years for film since the 1970's. It was the year that brought us the darkly brilliant ""Being John Malkovich,"" the spellbinding film ""The Insider,"" and the richly beautiful ""Topsy Turvy"" (Please note I am excluding the instant classics ""The Talented Mr. Ripley,"" ""The End of the Affair,"" ""The Sixth Sense,"" ""Boys Don't Cry,"" ""The Straight Story,"" ""All About My Mother,"" ""The Cider House Rules,"" and ""American Beauty"" due to time constraints as I could write paragraphs on how much I adored each one of these films). Yet I make no apologies for saying that ""Toy Story 2"" deserves to sit with these amazing artistic achievments as one of the greatest films of the late 1990's. No, it does not offer any particular new insights into the human condition, or brim with originality. But what ""Toy Story 2"" is the perfect studio film. It is that perfect Fred Astaire/Ginger Rogers dance that can be marvelled at time and time again, and coax tears out of the most cynical of souls. The film brilliantly interweaves a magnificent tapestry of comedy, fun, family entertainment, and pathos that is only rarely exhibited in today's cinema. As I watched the film in an audience full of laughing children I both found myself smiling so big that my face began to hurt, and gently crying.<br/><br/>I loved this movie. It is great for both kids and parents alike."

","When Toy Story 2 came out, I was very excited.  I felt Toy Story was the best animated film that I had ever seen and therefore a sequel was practically mouth-watering.  I was also encouraged by the reviews that it had been given.  Almost every critic had given it top-marks. So when I finally decided to go to the cinema, sat down with my popcorn, and got comfortable, what did I see in front of me?<br/><br/>A Star Wars parody!?!?<br/><br/>Seeing as this was the fashion twenty years ago, I was very disappointed that they had chose to do this for the first scene AND carry it on all through the film.  Although, I did like the ""playing catch"" scenario.  But there was a lack of originality all round.  This was a key feature in the first toy story and it needed to be in this one.  The new characters  (very few of them, may I add) just weren't interesting or appealing enough.<br/><br/>Overall, there were quite a few redeemable features that could suggest if another was done, it could be better, but there needs to be a marked improvement. Now, I may be being harsh, but it's only because Toy Story was so great and I was really expecting an improvement.<br/><br/>But, hey!  Bring on number three, I'll still watch it.<br/><br/>Melv."

To do this they must travel though the dangerous of streets,a toy story, the building where the collector lives and the perils of a very busy airport!!After Woody arrives at the home of the collector, he learns of the past of the toy and the stuff that went with the toy!!He also meets a old man , a young woman and a horse.

"Schwank","10","0","1","22 March 2000"," A marvellous achievement CONTAINS SPOILERS
","Toy Story 2 was my favourite movie of the last year. I'm a big movie fan, but this was the only movie I saw more than once in the theaters last year.<br/><br/>For those of you that haven't seen it yet or will again, I want to concentrate on the quality of the amazing amount of work that went into the animation in this film, the amount of personality put into characters.<br/><br/>The characters that were established in the first movie are drawn a little finer here, showing the better angels of their nature: Woody's loyalty and sense of responsibility to his fellow toys, Buzz's loyalty to Woody and his support of the other toys.  The personality animation they gave Andy's puppy when it bursts into his room and starts playing with Woody was incredible, being both puppyish and human, as if the dog shared the ""away from humans"" life the toys possess.<br/><br/>When I saw the first movie, I was amazed that I kept forgetting that I was watching an animated feature, and so it was in this case. The character of Al, the guy that steals Woody from the cash box during the yard sale, is a caricature of a short fat man but is so lifelike in movement and skin texture, it just adds to the suspension of disbelief that draws you into the movie. Once the movie gets to the place where Woody finally meets the other members of The Roundup Gang (and my favourite character, Jessie, voiced perfectly by Joan Cusack, is introduced), the real magic becomes apparent if you watch the characters that aren't speaking in some scenes. For instance, when Woody accuses Jessie of wrongdoing and the two of them have a fight (and Jessie kicks Woody's butt, too... Poor Woody can't seem to fight very well) Stinky Pete the Prospector breaks it up and scolds them. When you see this scene, watch Woody and Jessie. Their facial expressions, Jessie's especially, tell you volumes about them.<br/><br/>The scene where Jessie tells her story of abandonment to the tune of ""When She Loved Me"" is one of the most touching scenes I've seen on film in a long time. The character is so likeable that to see her owner outgrow her and relegate her to a Salvation Army truck is heartbreaking. The shot of her peering in dismay through a hole in the box she's left in as the camera pulls away from the spot (ironically just down a dirt road from the place she and her owner had once played) left the entire theatre silent, except for a few sniffles.<br/><br/>The key to a movie, ANY movie, is for the audience to identify and feel empathy with the characters, to draw you in to share their hurts and triumphs. Toy Story 2 succeeds in spades as the toys make you laugh, cry and cheer in equal measure."

","**Warning for minor spoilers and spelling mistakes**<br/><br/>I didn't really liked the first Toy Story-movie. Everybody said that it was great, but I thought (and I still do today) that the movie missed a spirit. It was only a show. A wide production of breathtaking animations. And, sure, the animation was impressive, but we have to review movies for what they are, right?<br/><br/>Therefore, the sequel surprised me like no other movie.<br/><br/>Toy Story 2 mixes some usual children's humour, most of it in the beginning, and ''real'' laughs, making it charming and entertaining like no other movie. At least not for kids.<br/><br/>The story seems simple, but still gets quite genious. People should not avoid this film, just because the animation. Lately, the animated movie has grown, to more adult-fitting. Not much, Toy Story 2 for example is not really an adult movie, but still some ingredients in ''Prince of Egypt'' and ''Antz''. Toy Story 2 is a movie for all ages. Really!<br/><br/>The characters are entertaining and no one is annoying. Some of the highlights (they are many) is definitely the encounter with Buzz Lightyear and another Buzz-action hero who really think he is a space hero, the car stop at the Barbie-section and the great ending scene at the airport. Like other sequels to movies like ''Home Alone'' and ''Austin Powers'' this sequel is not a remake of the original, where all the jokes has been easily uppdated and refreshed. Every lack the first movie had has been smoothely fixed up and the movie has a heart, wich, in my opinion, the original missed.<br/><br/>The adventure in the movie is a whole lot more entertaining than before, and it is a whole lot funnier than ''Toy Story''. Both the opening scene, the incounter with Woody and his round up-gang and the rescue-patrol is highly enjoyable. Quite a little masterpiece.<br/><br/>My rating: 9/10"

The film is incredibly funny, moving and exciting, with the charaters being so well acted that they are almost real. The humans in the first film got a bit of criticism for not looking real enough, but in Toy 2 they are scarily real. The voices are excellently cast, with Tom Hanks and Tim Allen reprising their roles from the first film with as much talent and enthusiasm as before, and Joan Crusak is among the newcomers to voice in the film. I can't say enough to praise this film except, role on Toy Story 3!"
"ianwarrender","7","0","1","23 February 2000"," A great sequel, yes better then the first, but not lets be getting carried away with the hype.
","This was a great sequel, Pixer and Disney, should be proud of what they have achieved. The story line was great, the extra characters, meant it was not just another Toy story 1', but a film in it's own right. It also had an extra depth, which seemed to lack before in the story. I think the script was well put together, and the directing was great.<br/><br/>However overall for all its greatness, it is not the best film ever, when all the hype is over, people will just see this as an above average family movie, which it is. I think Pixer still has a lot of power to surprise with what they can produce. I don't know about other people but in my cinema they had a feature called `Dinosaur', the CGI, in that just blow my mind away, and so for all Toy Story 2' had a lot of great effects, but Pixer next feature I'm sure will be better in all respects.<br/><br/>Well going back to Toy Story 2' the show would have not been the same if it was not for the voices of Tom Hanks and Tim Allen who did another splendid job, bring the characters to life.

","We are only just creeping towards the end of the years second month and I already believe that I've just watched perhaps the best film for the year. Toy Story 2 is a must see for all people, kids and adults alike.<br/><br/>For those of you that are unaware, not that many of you I'd imagine but, Toy Story follows the lives of a group of toys belonging to a child named Andy. Everytime Andy isn't in the room the toys come to life, I always knew that happened when I was a kid and now we have the proof. These toys get up to stunts and thrown into adventures, not all of which turn out to be fun, and this film follows the course of one such adventure.<br/><br/>The basic plot inlvolves Woody (Tom Hanks) being sold off to a toy collector by accident. Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen) and a few others set off to get him back.<br/><br/>The entire film is produced through computer generated images and they are absolutely stunning, its sometimes difficult to see the difference between these scenes and those in everday life. Obviously this adds to the realism of the picture.<br/><br/>The script then backs up this world class animation. It achieves this through its humour, both slapstick and subtle throughout. Also through the characters of each toy, they each have there own personalities, which believe it or not, you will be able to relate to throughout the film.<br/><br/>You care about whats going to happen, its sometimes edge of the seat stuff. The classic good guys versus bad guys, no hidden agenda, no political stance, no blood and guts, no swearing or vulgarity. For once I'm proud to say that it's good clean wholesome fun.<br/><br/>Go and see this film."

","The first Toy Story was an excellent, groundbreaking movie.  Toy Story 2 surpasses its predecessor and joins that very select group of 'better sequels'.  As with the original, the plot is a typical chase-and-rescue affair.  However, the way that director and co-writer John Lasseter executes it is exceptional.<br/><br/>Again, the unstoppable duo of Woody (Tom Hanks, just as well voiced as he acts) and Buzz (Tim Allen) are the stars.  The success of the first movie has helped to attract a constellation of Hollywood's vocal stars playing memorable characters such as Piggy Bank (John Ratzenberger), Jessie the Cowgirl (Joan Cusack) and the Prospector (Kelsey Grammer).<br/><br/>The storyline this time around is basically a reversal of the original's - this time Buzz gets to save Woody, after a toy collector kidnaps him.  The main moral issue is that, after Woody finds out he is a valuable toy, whether he chooses to stay and be ""admired by children for generations"", or to go back to his beloved Andy.<br/><br/>But the morality of this tale is not what should interest you.  Toy Story 2 is marvelously witty, with numerous injokes about Star Wars, computer games, and much more.  What makes this film so special though is the way it appeals to everyone of both genders and regardless of age.  The animation by Pixar is twice as stunning this time around, and the opening sequence is both funny and exciting.  And with the advent of Digital Light Projection, the characters will look even more stunningly lifelike.  There are even some hilarious 'out-takes' at the end, as with Pixar's other smash hit animation, A Bug's Life.<br/><br/>Basically what I am saying is that everyone should go see this movie - I guarantee that you will have fun, unless you are genetically predisposed against enjoying yourself.  Toy Story 2 is a great piece of fun.  Roll on Toy Story 3."

But will they get to Woody in time, or will he be sold to a toy museum?  <br/><br/>This movie is proof that not all sequels have to suck (Aliens notwithstanding).  Once again the creators have crafted a solid story line, with the addition of several well-rounded new characters (they're not just there to provide colorful scenery).   I particularly enjoyed the winking nods to blockbusters past (the Star Wars take was hilarious) and the numerous in-jokes for the adults in the audience.  As always it's fun to play spot the Disney product placement (I saw characters from Bugs Life, Aladdin and the early Pixar shorts among others).    But the best thing about the sequel is the animation.<br/><br/>With Toy Story, Pixar took computer animation to a level that most people only dreamed of (rent Wargames or Tron to see what ""cutting-edge"" used to look like).  Rather than rest on their laurels, the animators have gone a step further and deliver beautifully rendered landscapes, seamless action sequences, and even more realistic human characters.  Also, the amazing attention to detail - numbering the parts on the landing gear -makes you forget you are watching a cartoon (I kept expecting to see a gaffer's hand slip into view). This film leads me to believe that it will only be a matter of years before digital characters start replacing co-stars in live action films. <br/><br/>If you're looking for a film the whole family can enjoy, this is it.  Just try to avoid the matinee, or the screaming will drown out half the filmAlso, make sure you stay until the end of the credits for the ""outtakes""."

","The greatness and superiority of Disney is very obvious when watching a movie which has as much class as Toy Story 2. Everyone has seen the first film and opinion was that it couldn't really be stretched and that what made it so good was the novelty. It was a good movie, but good because it surprised the audience with the technology. Things are different in No.2. John Lassetter has made a movie which can rank alongside any other great movie seen in the last 100 years. There is still the cleverness which can be expressed by saying 'this was done on computer' but ahead of all of that is a great childrens story with enough humour and class about it to impress adults as well. I will not discuss the premise as it is hardly Sherlock Holmes, but I will tell you assuredly that for 75% of this movie you will have a smile on your face and a laugh in your belly. They have definetely moved things along a little with the technology as well, so much so that human characters look real and halfway through the film you could swear that the toys are as well. The script is very clever and has similar brilliant one-liners as the first. this truly is the future. Actors who don't need 20 million a movie. Crew working for their art. And a movie which is out to, very simply, entertain. Toy Story 2 cannot be bettered as a movie, and though a better film will come along, this will always rank as a major point in the history of cinema, bigger than the first."
"alice liddell","9","0","1","16 February 2000"," John Lasseter is the new Hitchcock: smuggling disturbing ideas into mass-market movies.
","Sometimes you beg for an epiphany and it doesn't quite come.  TOY STORY 2 is easily the best film of the year so far, funnier, richer, more inventive, frightening and emotional than anything else, because animation can do everything live action can do, and so much more.  Even the songs this time round are enjoyable (except, maybe, Jessie's lachrymose lament).  It deals with unbearably complex dilemmas with a maturity untapped by the likes of AMERICAN BEAUTY.  This should surely be enough - maybe I expect too much.<br/><br/>It's been peculiar in reviews to see critics' astonishment that a mere cartoon could actually carry so much weighty baggage.  They mustn't watch too many cartoons, because films from PINOCCHIO to THE THREE CABALLEROS to THE LION KING offer a similar assortment of riches.  Maybe they're secretly afraid that their precious actors will be made redundant.<br/><br/>2 works on many different levels.  Most immediately satisfying is the Hawksian romantic-comedy action movie, in which we watch men in action , at work, facing dark realities, positing loyalty and friendship as shores against the ruins.  This strand has a sublime emotional ambiguity, as on one level Buzz and friends repeatedly risk their lives to save a friend (Buzz is the Hawksian hero who must redeem himself after the first movie), while Woody (who also must redeem himself) at last finds a family, somewhere to belong just as he seemed outmoded and unloved.<br/><br/>This difficult choice between friendship proven in action and mere family ties is brilliantly, painfully revealed, and there are no easy answers. For the benefit of resolution, the family is not a love interest, which could have made things more awkward, and one member is made villainous for convenience, but the questions raised are still valid.<br/><br/>The film also works as an essay in making strange and unreliable the domestic and conservative.  On the one hand, there is something satisfyingly Surrealist about a house in which objects have more life than its human inhabitants - the different strands of reality set up by Buzz's opening adventures suggest that this may be the dream of an over-imaginative boy. There is a lack of fixity and control in having objects, bought by you to do your bidding, acting independently; it makes the solidity of the home unstable and unpredictable.<br/><br/>Yet, on the other hand, this alternative community is itself ordered in its seeming chaos, with almost military precision, and even before its terrifying adventures, its threats ARE the domestic, the fickleness of a child, the thoughtlessness of a mother, the vulnerability that privileges menacing villains.<br/><br/>2's great brilliance, though, lies in its expressing an awareness of its status as a sequal with the existential crises of its two heroes.  Woody starts the film with a lost hat (traditional emblem of masculine wholeness, virility, sexual prowess etc); he damages, then loses an arm; is abandoned and has a sublimely terrifying nightmare where the solidity of his existence crumbles, and he imagines the abyss of death.<br/><br/>Already shaken in identity, he is kidnapped, wrenched from familiar bearings, while performing a heroic act, and finds out that he is not a single, whole Woody, but part of a vast Woody legend, connected (as is this film) to a venerable tradition, repeated and reproduced ad nauseum, through merchandise.  His sense of wholeness destroyed, he accepts his fate, his destiny away from the world of life that is Andy's bedroom, to the sterile immortality of the museum.<br/><br/>In TOY STORY, Buzz already came to an awareness of his own limited masculinity.  But, in the film's most astonishing conceit, he faces a catacomb of Buzz Lightyears, and is forced to confront not only his lack of uniqueness, and not only the deluded image of his former past, but a new improved model; like Woody, Buzz becomes aware of the transience of life. The film opens with Buzz as intrepid action hero, only to be shockingly destroyed and shown to be a puppet in a computer game.<br/><br/>The image of two Buzzes and their evil father point to an awareness of the ambiguity of being a sequel (as a son is to a father), but also the powerlessness of anything in a postmodern world; there is no such thing as the film as unit - it is splintered outwards through merchandise, sequels, promotion etc.<br/><br/>Of course, 2 is most cherishable for being an incredible work of animation. So we're a bit jaded after STORY, but the CITIZEN KANE-like depth of field, the unheard of cinematic fluidity (which is not just trickery, but emotionally charged), the vibrant suburban colours, the ingenious characterisation (love Newman as, well, Newman), the awesome set-pieces (my favourite?  Either Woody's dream or Buzz and friends crossing the road) and exciting action, the musical-like freedom and audacity, the ingenious compositions, the very tangibility of the characters unavailable to live action, are all breathtaking.  In the end, I think I prefer the classical simplicity of STORY to this film's more varied daring, but who cares? This is the greatest sequel since THE GODFATHER, PART TWO, and it's a pretty good world that can find space for both these films AND a bolshy Hawksian heroine.  Magnificent."

"icebond","Null","0","1","15 February 2000"," Funny, Entertaining and sometimes deep.
","I saw this film with a friends kid brother. I probably got more love from it than he did. I feel I can generalize here. The theater must have had a ratio of 4:1 kids to adults. But I'm certain the adults got a lot more out of it than the kids did. The humor is totally camp. The visuals and the effects should keep the little one's entertained but the in jokes are enough to keep grown ups smiling long after they've left the cinema. I can't compare it to the first one because sad to say I haven't seen it yet. This will be rectified soon enough. Woody (Tom Hanks) & buzz (Tim Allen) are great but I think the most fun comes from the rest of the toys. Especially Rex (Wallace Shawn), Hamm (John Ratzenberger) and Slinkey Dog (Jim Varney-now deceased). Kelsey Grammer is hilarious as stinky Pete the prospector and the other buzz light year is arguably funnier than the real Buzz. The story is kept nice and simple. Woody gets kidnapped. Apparently he's worth a few bob due to his status as a collectors item.so it's up to the gang to mount a rescue operation. The main question the film poses is not as simple. Is it better to give pleasure to one child and eventually discarded or immortalized forever in a museum not actually bringing joy to anyone? Deep I know. That little philosophical debate aside, it's a top film that reminds us just what it means to be entertained."

","First of all....I loved it and I'm not afraid to admit it. I was actually looking forward to ""Toy Story 2"" because I thought the 1st one was great.<br/><br/>Remember when ""Toy Story 1"" first came out and everyone was talking about it and saying how great it was, but you kept thinking ""I am not going to go see a children's movie, no matter how great it is."" Somehow you ended up seeing it (probably the same way you ended up seeing Titanic)...either all the other movies were sold out or you bought a ticket for a ""grown up"" film and then snuck into this G-rated movie. You know what I am talking about.<br/><br/>It turns out that ""Toy Story 1"" took in over 350 million at the box office, 120 million in rentals and sold 22 million videos. Not bad for a G-rated film. Well, guess what...""Toy Story 2"" is just as good if not better. All your favorite toys are back and this time they brought a few friends. Story line...Woody (Tom Hanks) is once again having feelings of depression and worthlessness, but while his friends try to encourage him, Woody feels they are just ""toying"" with him. Before Woody can see a toy shrink (no not actually see a toy get smaller, but see a certified psychotoytherapist), he accidently ends up in a rummage sale. Along comes a toy collector who loves ""Woody"" toys and takes the real Woody home. Here Woody begins to find himself and begins making various emotional breakthroughs that restore his self-esteem and self-worth.<br/><br/>Now poor Woody is torn between the life he once had with his old toy friends (the enablers) and his new friends (a loving and caring Woody support group). Okay, maybe Walt Disney didn't see the film in exactly the same light that I did, but I think I am pretty darn close. As you watch this film, you forget that you are seeing an animated feature; for you recognize the voices as real, you laugh at their jokes, and feel sadness when they do...and in the end you are caught up into their world as if it is your own.<br/><br/>Bottom line....Disney has another great hit. We live in a world that doesn't always offer us opportunities to escape...but, if you go to ""Toy Story 2"", you can at least get away for a couple of hours."

Toy Story 2 had all the great points we enjoyed in the first movie, with none of the negatives.<br/><br/>The story line was easy to follow, without being boring, stupid, or frustrating.

The spoofs of Pleasantville/50s US TV shows, Star Wars, etc. is good and there's only 1 musical number in the middle as opposed to about 3 or 4 in the original, which is much better.<br/><br/>The comedy works even better this time around with tongue-in-cheek digs at the original Toy Story goings on and the little snippets of former Pixar productions, such as the Tin Toy Demo which appeared on the TV set, when Hamm is flicking through the channels.<br/><br/>Rex is my favourite character in the entire film.. but all the characters and the new ones work well in this film.

I kind of felt that Transformers (the great toyline of the 80's) would be awesome to include albeit innappropriate (that's why there's Beast Wars).<br/><br/>There's more pop culture reference such as Star Wars, Jurassic Park and Godzilla (which was used plenty of times).

I can't imagine a better film for small children to see and adults as well. I have alot of friends who won't watch animated films because they are made for children. I think that my ""grown-up"" friends should stop thinking these films are for children and start realizing how great animation can make you feel."
"Tim Gomersall","10","0","1","2 February 2000"," They've done it again.
","Yesterday I attended an advanced screening for this film in London's West End; it was screened in a large theatre full of students, not kids, because the company running the preview were testing out the film on our age bracket particularly (ie people in their 20s). An recipe for disaster? A case of a theatre full of people watching the wrong film? The hell it was...<br/><br/>Each and every person in the theatre loved it. Being a Brit who's lived abroad, I'm used to the idea of people cheering and clapping at the parts they particularly enjoy... but only in America. This film was enough to provoke such a response from even us non-emotive Brits however, and on a great many occasions. We laughed loud, broke into cheers regularly, and actually applauded at least five times. I was too busy enjoying the film to keep count.<br/><br/>Why? Well, the humour in it is NOT exclusively aimed at for kids; that's not to say they won't find it funny, but I defy an parent to watch it without at some point saying 'my kid's not going to get that', or even, in the case of a couple of surprisingly risque gags, 'I HOPE my kid's not going to get that'...<br/><br/>Also, it was basically an action film. After a comfortable few opening scenes which establish that all is well, it doesn't take long for things to go a bit awry, and then more so, and soon there are toys all over the city and the tension becomes genuine. The laughs keep on coming however, and there is (with the exception of a single concession to the notorious Disney Song) not a single unentertaining moment to be found.<br/><br/>There's a different take on the Toy idea (what if you're outgrown?) and almost any possible inclusion you could wish for as far as references to the first film, or others, or scenarios that are dying to be explored (like a now wisened Buzz meeting another Buzz who still thinks he's a toy). And then there's all the new characters (the implied arrival of a Mrs Potato head at the end of the first movie is gloriously realised, for example) are as amusing as all the old favourites, who all enjoy large roles in the limelight.<br/><br/>It's also comforting to see that they've kept to the overall look of the original. You can't help but think that they could draw people a lot more realistically if they wanted to, but they don't; because then it wouldn't feel like the same world. This is an excellent example of how Pixar treat their movies with a lot more importance than they attach to their (also spectacular) visuals.<br/><br/>If you loved the first film, go and see this one. There is nothing they could have done that they have not, and nothing they shouldn't have done that they have. Once again Pixar have remembered the most important thing about filmmaking; all the computer visuals are very well and good, but if there's no substance to the movie you're wasting your time. This is clearly a movie that was sat down and thought about, and the results are breathtaking."

Be alert for references to numerous film classics such as Star Wars, Jurassic Park, 2001: A Space Oddity, and more.  Toy Story 2 is actually one of the best films that I have seen this year, and I would highly recommend it to anyone.

Bottom line is this is just as good, if not better, than the the original.  The one aspect of the film that shines is the conveyed feeling of how a toy is not only ""a toy"" but an entity that has been given life by its owner.  How much you love a toy is how much it will live.  Great stuff here.  Of course, Tim Allen and Tom Hanks are great. I'll stop talking about it so you can just go see it.  You'll have a great time.

","Some four years, I saw the original ""Toy Story"" and thought it was one of the best movies of 1995 with groundbreaking computer animation and a story that was just as entertaining to adult as it was to kids.  But last year, when Pixar's second film, ""A Bug's Life,"" was somewhat disappointing due to its pandering a bit too much to kids and word was out that the sequel to ""Toy Story"" would be a lowly direct-to-video release, I did not have much hope that this sequel would be any good - even when they announced that it would be released theatrically instead of direct-to-video.  But, boy, was this movie a surprise - it expands and deepens the original and seems even more clever than anything Pixar has created so far (which, given the high quality of their output, is saying a lot).  The fantastic computer animation, which almost makes the original look primitive in comparison, is really just more icing on the cake.  This film, like the original, is watchable again and again (and if you're under six, again and again and again every day)."

","Usually, I am usually not fond of sequels because they never seem to live up to the original; characters are no longer played by the original, or the storyline has changed dramatically.  When I heard about Toy Story2, I was hesitant about watching it at the theatres, but after listening to some reviews, I wanted to see what this movie was all about.  Before going on any further, I must say that I have no kids, I went with a good friend and we both loved the movie.  It was a continuation of the original; only a few years later.  The characters are older (Andy, sis, and the puppy) and the characters that played a big role in the original are still there (Buzz, Woody, Hamm, Mr. Potato Head, Rex, Etch-a-Sketch, Bo Peep,etc)<br/><br/>Congrats to Pixar and Disney for a wonderful movie that didn't contain any cursing or sex.  It was a refreshing change that isn't just for kids. Throughout the movie, there were references to other movies (Star Wars and Jurassic Park) that an older child or an adult will catch.  Plus, there were a couple of scenes that I thought were adult oriented but subtle enough for a child to not understand ""double meaning.  (The scene near the end when Buzz was so ""impressed"" by Jessie that his wings popped out.)<br/><br/>
I loved the fact that Rex was a major video game freak especially reading up on the game when they got to the Toy Barn (which BTW, I noticed when I watched TS again, they mentioned it when the commercial came on).  That scene with Zurg and the other Buzz was funny because I was gonna say the same thing as a joke!<br/><br/>I laughed and I almost cried.  It was absolutely wonderful to see how technology have improved the computer generated cartoon.  The attention to detail was amazing; the cheesy fingers, dust on the shelf.  Several times I had to wonder if it was real or animated.

The situations that Buzz and his pals find themselves in is humorus as well, but the dialogue that happens during those scenes is what makes the movie hysterical.<br/><br/>The only part that was a little annoying is that the movie could have ended in three places, but it didn't.  The movie felt it dragged in places, but the ""extra"" scenes didn't take away from the movie either.  It was a very good movie and is definitely worth seeing.

But the technology is not what makes this movie work so well. The characters, dialogue and action operate on enough levels to keep adults and children entertained. When something slapstick is happening for the kids to enjoy, there's some obscure or deadpan piece of wit to lay on the adults. This layering goes on throughout. It might be wishful thinking, but if Babe deserved a Best Picture nomination a few years ago, Toy Story 2 should get at least the same consideration.

","Maybe I'm permanently deluded, but I'm not nearly close to full-brimming from the delight I get from the brilliant mind of John Lasseter and the can-you-top-this crew at Pixar. I went into seeing Toy Story 2 with reserved anticipation, a little uncertain how my eyes would respond to TI's fully digital film-less film projection, and, admittedly, slightly besmirched from the plot-spoiler-laden trailers I was unfortunate enough to see during the last few months. Woody's lost, the gang is sent to rescue him, resplendent with fleeting yet chronological shots of all the major venues of action along the way (the busy street, the toy store, the elevator shaft, etc.). Didn't I already know how the plot would unfold? I mean, this wasn't like reading a Peanuts strip before seeing Citizen Kane (which, I admit, happened to me), but it was damned near close. At the end, the trailer DID reveal quite a bit, probably more than I would have preferred to know. But I didn't care. And that, to me, is the true beauty of this movie.<br/><br/>It's not just the toy gags, the deliberate pot-shots at other films, or the lavishly gorgeous animation and fluidity of character detail and movement, but how everything comes together so tidily and so satisfyingly so. Plus, you could do far worse than the well-cast, and well-meshed voices in giving a pulse and quirky facial english to the beautifully rendered toys. I laughed out loud...many times in fact.<br/><br/>If the first Toy Story sent a message on the importance of friendship, the sequel takes it one step further, exploring our complicated and often tenuous perception on the people and things we love as we grow up. As we mature, we often abandon and discard objects (clearly, the toys are symbols for real people) or friends for inexplicable and often petty reasons. The underlying message: relationships change, people change, but as much as it's important to think hard about who and what you hold dear, sometimes you have to let others go, based on their choices instead of your own. Where I have been reveling in irreverence and maniacally original visions for the past few months, Toy Story 2 was a wonderfully entertaining way to reacquaint me with the cliche of tried-and-true."

It's a simple story, and though this can be considered a positive thing sometimes, we do expect much more form Pixar and Walt Disney. I do recommend it anyway.

","After A Bug's Life I had rather high expectations from Pixar on Toy Story 2, and I am glad to say that it had met them and more.<br/><br/>One good thing was the way the movie expanded beyond Andy's house.  The toy barn, the office, the airport, even the streets and roads looked very real, because of the attention to details.  I think the ultimate goal of computer generated films is to re-create reality, and Toy Story 2 is one big step closer.<br/><br/>There was plenty of humor too.  Except for a the Barbie parts (which I don't think Mattel would like), the movie feature the light-hearted jokes and gags which only a Disney animated film can give you, and the timing was perfect. You don't feel neither overwhelmed because there was too many gags in too little time, nor bored because the jokes were far between.  Just the right amount of humor make this film enjoyable.<br/><br/>The best thing however was that the movie was more than just eye-candy. Even though the plot was more or less traditional, it did have many subplots that actually merged together quite nicely.  The flow was flawless, as each subplot was given just the right amount of attention.  At the end, everything was taken care of and you leave your seat feeling satisfied.<br/><br/>All in all, a very good film for all occasions.  Take your kids or go with your friends.

","Toy Story 2 gives the main character, Woody, a decision to make, which alone sets it apart from most other films which would just place him in some sort of danger.<br/><br/>It also has one of the most heartbreaking scenes, I've seen in a film in a long time(minor spoiler coming).<br/><br/>Perhaps, it was so heartbreaking because all the toys in Toy Story 2 have the personalities of our favorite pets. They are innocent, naive, trusting and unconditionally loving to those that they belong to. They are always there when you need them, they always think the best about you and they are unwaveringly loyal.<br/><br/>It might have been that realization that sent much of the audience, including me, into tears during the musical flashback ( to Sarah McLaughlin's ""When She Loved Me"") of Jessie's (Woody's long lost red yarn hair doll companion) abandonment by her owner who got too old for her.<br/><br/>Even when Jessie was left under the bed and forgotten as her owner discovered nail polish and boys to when she was finally taken from under the bed and given a final car ride to be dropped off at Good Will, she never lost faith in her. Right to the time she was left in a good will box, she believed her owner would be with her again. That trust and unconditional love of Jessie made the final moment so devastating that I fight back tears just recalling it. It was an incredibly powerful moment that I am still in awe of...<br/><br/>I'm also in awe of how the makers of Toy Story 2 could have weaved in this sequence in a way that doesn't collapse the good nature of the film but they did. <br/><br/>The movie also takes aim at collectors...<br/><br/>At least the type of collectors that care about nothing but the money, who are obsessed with things being MIB (mint in box) and totally overlook the emotional value in the toys they are after. <br/><br/>Then, of course, there's the wonderful music, humor and animation in this movie. There are some terrific in jokes and great laughs period.<br/><br/>This movie is a home run in all respects, go see it soon"

"Artêmis","8","0","1","21 December 1999"," Beautiful and fun but...
","I really liked Toy Story 2. It is very good, watching it is fun for all ages and it's in my opinion the most beautiful movie ever made by Disney. Everything is very colorful and the toys are so perfect that they look real (although the humans are still strange). And it's not interrupted in each 15 minutes for a nonsense musical play like almost all other Disney's movies do! And the references to Star Wars are hilarious. But even being almost perfect, I can't give TY 2 a 10. I said it was the most beautiful film but not the most touching. I watched the whole movie smiling, laughing sometimes and having fun but it's impossible to fell something, to fell sorry or cry because Woody will go to a Japanese Museum, or because Jessie is living in a dark box. They're toys! And worse, made by computers! It's very hard to enjoy the scenes that should be touching. No, you enjoy those scenes, like them, but not because you're sorry but because everything is majestic, every single detail is perfect. In fact, it's hard to LOVE them. <br/><br/>Here, at IMDb you can see how people are exaggerating. TY2 is great but it's not the 16th best movie of all the times. Of course Toy Story's secret is that it was enjoyable for all ages and almost impossible to hate. Look at me, I really thing it doesn't deserve this but I'm giving it an 8 or 9 and, in fact, I'm helping this siyuation to continue.   <br/><br/>Well, it's not so hard to give it a 10 but when I look at my 10-movies I can't even compare them to Toy Story 2. TY will never be better or even similar to movies as Election, Go, Pleasantville, The Sixth Sense, Hilary and Jackie, Valmont, Deconstructing Harry, All about My Mother, Mallrats, Clerks, Shakespeare in Love, Cruel Intentions, Next Stop Wonderland.... God, look at Eyes Wide Shut: a great movie, 10/10 but as it's 'hate-able"", received a lot of 1s. And others amazing movies as Dogma are almost out of the Top 250 because of this ""exaggeration"".<br/><br/>For non-USA viewers, I would recommend to see TY2 with captions not with ""voices from your country"". This way you'll enjoy a lot more as Disney spends a lot of money in voices, songs and sound effects what may not happen when it's being translated. And it's fun to see some famous voices as Tom Hanks' in Woody. So, enjoy TY2, love it but don't expect one of the best movies of the history."

","Seldom does a film appears that warrants a comment. Episode I should have been that film this year, but the only thing that can be said about it is that it was the biggest disappointment ever. Enter Toy Story 2. A film that *should* have been a disappointment. The original was a great film, a milestone. How could it be that the sequel was better? Well, it is better. So much better in fact that it has been the most enjoyable film I have seen this year. I can't remember a cartoon or computer animated film that could make me cry since ""Beauty and the Beast"". Toy Story 2 managed that, and it also made me laugh as a kid 10 seconds afterwards. It is a real joyride, a masterpiece, a film with true content (the meaning of life), and it stresses the values of friendship, loyalty and love.<br/><br/>If I had kids, I would take them to see this gem time and time again.

","I was astonished at how good this was and how much I enjoyed it. Not only did I appreciate the characters of Woody and Buzz, but Jesse really got to me too. This movie has a huge amount of confidence; none of the spectacular animation effects were just to impress, yet they were just amazing. For example, the ""crossing-the-street"" scene where each time the ""traffic cones"" stop a bigger disaster happens had a rhythm and a momentum that made it impressive on its own merits, yet it wasn't just a gratuitous ""show-off"" sequence. And all the little things (seeing Rex in the rear-view mirror as a quote from Jurassic Park, the ""I _am_ your father"" sequence, the Barbies, the ""angry eyes"" - don't we all need a set of those?, etc.) kept my attention. Everything works. The movie turned me into a 10-year-old kid who lost all track of time watching it - and that's because the story and the writing are top-notch. I laughed, I cried.<br/><br/>Just a couple more points It's interesting that two of my favorite films of the year were G-rated - this and ""The Straight Story"". The only movie I enjoyed more to date was ""The Sixth Sense"". Finally, I consider this movie payback for taking my kids to see the Pokemon movie. Twice. Take that, Pikachu!"

","Disney does it again. Unlike the sequel to Aladdin, Toy Story 2 shines brightly as one of the best (if not thee best) animation films of the century. The first Toy Story was fabulous, but Toy Story 2 not only improves on the story, character, and lessons of life, but also gives us better visuals than the first movie. The animation of the Toy Store owner, the dog, and the mother was absolutely wonderful, as well as ALL the other characters in the film. Even the short story about the Lamp icon before the movie was brilliantly done. Pixar will be receiving more awards for this film.<br/><br/>Going back to Woody's roots and having Buzz try to save him this time around was a nice welcome. I was happy to see all the voice actors came back because the movie just wouldn't have been the same without Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, Don Rickles and the others. Even Joan Cusack did a fabulous job as Jessie the wild cowgirl. This is a must see film for kids and adults alike. I couldn't find any flaws in the film at all. A perfect 10 if you ask me.

And ""Toy Story 2"" continued that hot streak, with  outstanding technical work, a clever and thought-provoking story, and an Oscar-worthy score by Randy Newman.<br/><br/>Technically, TS-2 aims higher than the original, and succeeds brilliantly. Yet I slightly prefer TS-1, because I favor the relatively simple charm of TS-1's plot to the more helter-skelter vibe I got from TS-2.

Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, and the rest of the cast are back as Woody, Buzz, Hamm, Rex and the other toys from Andy's room. In addition, there are also a number of new characters including Jessie, Stinky Pete, and Wheezy.

Terrific animation, great vocal work, and a fun movie for anyone of any age."
"scinatfilm","10","0","1","13 December 1999"," Amazing, stunning achievement
","The film follows the continuing adventures of `Andy's toys,' particularly Woody (Tom Hanks), the pullstring cowboy, and Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen), the space action figure. This time, the dilemma centers around what happens to toys when they are cast aside for more `grownup' pursuits.<br/><br/>It seems that Woody is a collector's item, and is stolen by a greedy toy salesman (Wayne Knight). Woody finds that he was part of `Woody's Roundup,' a 1950's TV show that was cancelled after Sputnik. He meets Jessie (Joan Cusak), a rowdy cowgirl, his horse Bulls-eye, and Prospector Pete (Kelsey Grammer), who has never been opened and is doomed to live inside his box. Buzz gathers the toys (all of the cast members from the first film are back, with all their wonderful talent) and sets off on a rescue mission. The ensuing adventure is not to be missed, with action sequences so fully realized and believable that it's easy to forget this is an animated film. The visuals, of course, are mind-blowing, given the newer technology.<br/><br/>The film deals with very poignant issues regarding whether toys should be in a museum or played with until they're forgotten. When Jessie sadly reminisces about her former owner (`When She Loved Me,' sung by Sarah McLaughlin), it was one of the most touching moments I've seen on film in a long time. `Toy Story 2' takes the original in wonderfully new and inventive directions. It is already being called the `Godfather II' of animation; in other words, improving a seemingly unimprovable film. Frankly, the film is worthy of a Best Picture Oscar nomination. Not too bad for a sequel."

"Rhino Rover","10","0","1","9 December 1999"," WOW!
","Ok, ok. I know this is a cartoon and the target audience is mainly children but WOW! I can honestly say that this was one of the most entertaining movies I've seen all year. I was completely engaged from beginning to end and my mind never wandered once. And just in case you're wondering, when I went to see the evening showing of this movie, the audience was comprised completely of adults. There was not a single child in the theatre.<br/><br/>For those of you who never saw the first movie (and I'm not ashamed to say that I say that one too), this movie brings back all the original characters and introduces some new ones. Walt Disney also did a very smart thing by bringing back all the original voices. In some of their other movie sequels (Pocahontas 2) they change the voices of the original characters which ended up taking away from the movie. The story line revolves around the rescue of Woody. By a strange sequence of events, Woody accidentally ends up in a garage sale and a slimy toy dealer steals him for a private collection that he tries to sell to a Japanese art dealer. Buzz and the rest of the gang witness this theft and organize a rescue mission that takes them from the safe confines of Andy's (the boy who owns all these toys) home to the big city. Along the way they meet some other interesting toys and encounter all kinds of unusual problems that they find some very creative solutions to. The ending is slightly predictable but in this case, who cares! It was a very fun movie to watch.<br/><br/>The voice acting was absolutely excellent. All the actors were able to bring out the characters of each of the toys and create feeling and humor. And the humor!!! It was outrageously funny. The humor was obviously clean but I have never laughed so much. The computer graphics was excellent and they did somethings that made me wonder ""how did they do that?""<br/><br/>Overall, there is not a single negative thing that I can say about this movie. It never slowed down nor were there any inconsistent plot flows or poor acting performances. Everything about it was entertaining from beginning to end. For those of you who are parents, you HAVE to take your kids to see this movie. For you adults, you HAVE to see this movie (guys, this is a great date movie). Am I making myself clear yet?

","I didn't see Toy Story 2 the day it came out, but every review and every person kept repeating the same thing over and over: ""Toy Story 2 is better than the original"".  I decided not to pay too much attention to the hype until I saw the movie myself and form my own opinion.<br/><br/>Here it is: Toy Story 2 is better than the original.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong.  I thought the first movie was fantastic, but this movie was a blast to watch from the second it started to the end credits.  I laughed out loud at several points in the movie because of the in-jokes, fast one liners, visual gags and the not-too-subtle parodies of Star Wars, Jurassic Park and even the original Toy Story.  A lot of lines were reused from the first film, but the context of how they were used in these new situations were clever.  This is an intelligent movie and doesn't talk down to the viewer, regardless of age.  Did I mention the CG effects (the movie itself?) in this film were even more of a technical ""wow"" than the first movie?<br/><br/>I liked the new characters, which fit in with the old favorites and the storyline without seeming like there were an overwhelming abundance of characters.  Each character made their own contribution to the plot, however minor, and the story never seemed to drag on for me.<br/><br/>Overall, this was a fun movie to simply sit back and enjoy.  It's thoughtful, funny and yet another quality animated movie from 1999.  This year seems to be the one that the animation genre truly gets its due.  If a Part 3 is ever made, I hope Disney maintains the quality that the first two films of the series have set.<br/><br/>Incidentally,  Jessie's song will probably make a lot of people feel really guilty for ever abandoning an old toy. It certainly pulls on the emotional heartstrings."

Toy Story 2 is that rarest of creatures, a sequel that just might be better than the original.<br/><br/>The gee-whiz factor of the computer animation is undeniable, but  what holds the movie together is a great story. I saw this film with my wife, and my four-year-old. We all had a great time. Great slapstick for the kids, incredible in-jokes for the adults. Look for all sorts of Pixar characters sprinkled throughout the movie, plus great homages to other popular films.<br/><br/>Perhaps the biggest treat: Before the movie, (at least when I saw it in Suburban Atlanta), they showed Pixar's first short: LUXO, JR. What a wonderful opportunity to see this gem that spawned Pixar's hopping-lamp logo mascot.<br/><br/>The third consecutive winner from Pixar. Not just a great animated film. A great film, period."
