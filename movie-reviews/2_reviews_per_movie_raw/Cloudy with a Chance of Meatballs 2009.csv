","Living in the UK, I had never heard of the children's book Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs and to be honest, I thought it sounded a little too peculiar and odd for my tastes going by the title and trailers. However, being a big fan of animated movies, I decided to take the risk and judge the movie for myself; and I'm so glad I did.<br/><br/>Not only does Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs have a quirky, thoughtful and imaginative storyline, it also exudes humour through its likable characters, discerning messages and vivid visual style. Telling the tale of a young man's quest to become an inventor, the film shies away from numerous Disney clichés creating a unique and original world full of colour and inspired characters. Unlike most Dreamworks animations, the characters are fully developed and rounded without the need for countless A-list celebrity voice-overs. The screenplay is similarly outstanding in terms of humour with countless laugh-out-loud moments that will appeal to both adults and children alike.<br/><br/>The animation and visual style of the film isn't up to the stunning beauty of the latest Pixar movies such as Ratatouille or WALL-E but it certainly exudes a similar level of ingeniousness, creativity and originality as seen in such movies. Albeit, amongst the wild plot and genuinely hilarious dialogue lies a subtle moral tale of parental recognition, portion sizes and personal confidence.<br/><br/>Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs took me by surprise, I went into the cinema expecting an average computer generated movie incomparable with today's best of the genre and came out astonished by the sheer creativity oozing from every aspect of the film.<br/><br/>8/10."

","Anyone involved with the elementary school world as at least heard of the Barret classic ""Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs."" As a teacher, I was thrilled to learn it was to be made a movie. As usual, however, that leads to the problem of whether it would stick too much to the book to be entertaining for the screen or a Hollywood catastrophe that steals only the title?<br/><br/>I know it's irritating to read from those book loyalists, but it's only a fair comparison. I felt this movie found a perfect balance of big-screen awesomeness and the charm of the book.<br/><br/>For book enthusiasts, they pretty much had everything right. This film does indeed follow the plot of the book. Entire illustrations are recreated for the movie with stunning nods to Ron Barret's artwork. Then again, one must keep in mind that the book was an extremely general plot. The movie goes into detail, very much into detail, of what was going on in the town. <br/><br/>We have the classic nerd, Flint Lockwood, a lovable and goofy character who embodies the wannabe coolness and social awkwardness and desperation of every social outcast. He's almost painful to watch, but I think it's what makes him so likable--you feel sorry for him. Anywho, in a desperate attempt to prove his worth to his father, he invents a machine that turns water into food. And hence the coming of the trademark weather of Swallow Falls (later renamed to Barrets' Chewandswallow). <br/><br/>Honestly, I was surprised at the plot they got going out of this--while still maintaining the basics of the book. It had an ADHD spirit with wonderfully over-the-top characters. This will probably annoy many a soul, but I thought it a winning combination for those who can put up with it all. Really, you need the heart and mind of a child for this, but if you can summon those up, you will be impressed.<br/><br/>I saw it in the normal format, but I'm sure it was an intense hoot in 3D. That might have been a bit much for me, but I'm sure the kids loved food flying at them. Regardless, the animation was stunning, combining a tribute to Ron Barret's amazing illustrations in background with pleasantly cartoony characters. <br/><br/>This was much better than expected. It was creative, extremely fun, and paid reference to everything from ""Independence Day"" to ""The Twilight Zone"". You may need the heart and mind of a child for this, but if you can summon those up, you will be impressed."
"tkeane-1","8","63","87","22 September 2009"," Sublimely Ridiculous
","From the title through every character right to the end this film is a roller-coaster ride of absolutely ridiculous fun that will have kids and adults alike doubled over with laughter. I personally nearly choked from laughing so hard at one particular point.<br/><br/>What makes this movie so great is the characters...you can't go wrong with Bill Hader ever and Anna Faris I wouldn't be a fan of at all but she is cast completely out of character here and you would never guess it is her. The real entertainment lies in the support cast though. James Caan is outstanding as the father and Mr. T as the loving father and over enthusiastic local cop will have you in tears. Benjamin Bratt and Neil Patrick Harris didn't have much work to do with their characters but even with so few lines they are stars, particularly Steve the 'talking' monkey. There was one bit character that I found highly entertaining who had the best line in the whole thing when referring to hamburgers as tasting ""significantly better than sardines"".<br/><br/>I would consider myself a bit of a movie buff and my leaning is very much toward the art-house. On a recent Saturday afternoon, I choose to take a risk and cross the sticky floor, trying to avoid stepping on one of the many screaming kids running around, my heart beating fast and hard with nervousness and anxiety that maybe this was a mistake. When the time came I casually donned my 3D glasses and 90minutes later with a pain in my side I wanted to go again... It's been an long time since that has happened!"
"innitbrill","10","109","158","19 September 2009"," Fantastic!
","It may be because I had insanely high expectations for this movie, but I thought it was GREAT. I admit, I had been excited for it since I saw the first trailer a few months ago. I went and saw it the day it came out in IMAX 3D, which was cooler in itself, with my sister. I'm fifteen and she's twenty: we were both cracking up the whole time. There were no 'filler' jokes, as many kid's films do today. No jokes with 'potty humor'. All jokes were in good taste and all genuinely funny. The whole script was insanely well written. Timing, pacing, everything was great. The animation was fantastic and really fit the film. The character designs were all original and cute. You could tell how much effort was put into this movie. And the cast! I watched the (adorable!) credits and was surprised! I'd thought I'd recognized that fool pitying officer. (: The whole cast did a terrific job. No complaints there.<br/><br/>This is a fun, lighthearted film. I walked out of the theater feeling the best I'd felt in a long time. Great family film, great film to see with your friends, great film to see by yourself, great film all together. Highly recommended."
"hungerartist","10","56","78","11 October 2009"," blown away, visually stunning and hilarious
","I'm not a huge fan of animated features, or children's movies. My tastes usually gravitate towards (good) horror films, foreign films, and more artsy independent features. I saw Up, thought it was a really great animated feature, but would I see it again? Maybe if i was babysitting. Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs, however, blew me away! It had such vivid, sometimes surreal, almost PSYCHEDELIC qualities, that I found myself awestruck at what the creators of this film had come up with! There was so much color, and such an imaginative design quality to the film that I couldn't help being thrilled. I'd probably give this 8/10 for those qualities alone, but in my opinion, the best part of all were the characters! The comedy was seriously non-stop, and so over the top ridiculous at times I was completely laughing out loud. Mr. T as the security guard. Very entertaining and fun character. The talking monkey. The Guatemalan weather assistant/doctor/pilot/whatever else... HILARIOUS. baby brett? Oh man. The list goes on. I'm 28 years old, and while I often enjoy kind of sick, off the wall humor, I really found this to be a VERY funny movie. It's personally very refreshing to know that humor doesn't have to be R rated to be hilarious. It sounds ridiculous, but this is probably going up there on my favorite movies list, right next to the films of polanski, kubrick, argento, hennenlotter, and the coen brothers."

","Inspired by Ron and Judi Barrett's beloved children's book of the same name, CLOUDY WITH A CHANCE OF MEATBALLS follows inventor Flint Lockwood and brainy weathergirl Sam Sparks as they attempt to discover why the rain in their small town has stopped while food is falling in its place. Meanwhile, lifelong bully Brent relishes in tormenting Flint just as he did when they were kids, and Mayor Shelbourne schemes to use Flint's latest invention--a device designed to improve everyone's lives--for his own personal gain.<br/><br/>OK, I admit it. The trailer for this film looked average, compared to other animated flicks, especially the films from Pixar. I thought the film would be too kiddy for me and that the storyline was beyond lame. I mean, food falling from the sky doesn't draw people in, does it? Oh, how wrong I was. I think we just found the third contender for the best animated movie section in the Academy Awards, people! Not only is this much better than non-Pixar animated films that has been released in SOME time (I think the last was HAPPY FEET?), but it's also one of the most visceral, inventive, entertaining, ingenious, silly movies that I've seen this year! Oh, wait. This is the only one.<br/><br/>I felt like a kid again when I put my 3D glasses on. Things popped out in a flashy fashion and the movie told in a quick pace with zippy dialogue! I wanted to grab the delicious-looking foods on the screen, from hotdogs to ice cream! It's like being a kid in a candy store! There's so much craziness here that I can't even dare to describe! When was it the first time that you saw a talking monkey that ripped a heart out from a live gummy bear?! When was it the first time that you saw a live turkey eating a human being?! Everything in this film is so ridiculous and preposterous that you have no choice but to go along with the ride<br/><br/>This is also a very, very funny film with a laugh per minute with some really clever jokes scattered throughout the film. But don't worry. There's a story in here too. It's been quite a while since I've seen a good father-and-son film (the last was FINDING NEMO?), but this film succeeded in that department as well. The message is by no means blatant and preachy at all. The cast is also a splendid delight, Mr. T standing out as one of the top characters because you can never really escape his noticeable voice. Bill Hader and Anna Faris did a wonderful job in their roles as well.<br/><br/>Oh, and did I mention the film was a visual feast (no pun intended)? You will see things in here that you have NEVER seen and probably will never see again in any other film. This should automatically get you a ticket to the theaters because when are you ever going to see a talking monkey grabbing a heart out of a live gummy bear?! WHEN?! The 3D technology is near flawless. It's probably the best looking 3D I've ever seen, the image looking very sharp from background to foreground. I also found the score by Mark Mothersbaugh to be amazing and exceptionally memorable.<br/><br/>If there's one bad thing I have to say about the movie, it isn't as good as Pixar's storytelling. However, CLOUDY WITH A CHANCE OF MEATBALLS should be a movie you should watch in theaters because it's unlike any movie you have ever seen. There's a lot of ingenuity and inventiveness and cleverness that is warped around the movie. The film is entertaining for both the kids and the adults to enjoy, so there's no need to worry. But wow, was this film a spectacle. If you have the chance to see this in 3D, see it but I'm sure the 2D version works just as well. If you're iffy about the trailer, I guess that's a good thing because the movie surpasses the trailer by ten times. Prepare to get served...literally."
"Apemangalore","9","107","163","19 September 2009"," Possibly the funniest animated movie I've ever seen
","Just to set the record straight, I'm not a fan of most non-Disney Animation, non-Pixar animated films being released these days, and even my faith in the former was just recently renewed with last year's Bolt (which has topped Pulp Fiction as my personal favorite movie of all time). Sure, every once in a while, a brilliant piece such as Coraline will come along, but honestly, I find that to be one of the relatively few exceptions from this decade. So, with that said, I initially wasn't looking forward to seeing Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs. What further detracted from my excitement were the trailers, which led me to believe that the film was going to be strictly targeted towards children. Having just seen the film, though, I am happy to say that all of my fears were put to rest.<br/><br/>Visually, this is perhaps one of the most spectacular animated movies I've ever seen, with literally every frame being a feast for the eyes. There were moments, especially throughout the movie's undeniably thrilling climax, in which my jaw just dropped in amazement. Not to throw in so much hyperbole, but this truly is one of the best animated films in terms of pure eye candy. While there's so much else in this movie to enjoy, the visuals alone make it worth the price of admission.<br/><br/>The vocal performances in Cloudy are some of the most impressive ones I've heard in quite some time. Both Bill Hader and Anna Faris as Flint and Sam, respectively, capture the essence of these two socially-awkward, smarter-than-you-might-think type of characters perfectly. Overall, I felt these two characters had some real chemistry, and as a result, I thoroughly enjoyed watching their relationship evolve throughout the course of the film. Mr. T is also terrific as the city cop, Earl, delivering some of the most gut-bustingly hilarious lines in the entire film. With that said, this is quite possibly the funniest animated movie that I've ever seen. To put it simply, there were a couple of moments in which I literally thought that I was going to be ill.<br/><br/>I walked out of Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs with very much the same feeling as I did with '08's aforementioned Bolt: astonished by how mediocre I initially expected the film to be, and how enjoyable it actually ended up being. The only thing keeping this film from getting a 10/10 in my book is – even with the few scenes that managed to tug at my heartstrings - the lack of an emotional punch powerful enough to get me choked up. However, given the film's quirky nature, I view that as a mild complaint at best. Go see it, folks."
"SebaZava","8","31","44","30 November 2009"," A hilarious and imaginatively entertaining animated movie.
","Although - as many people do - I generally prefer Pixar films to the animated fare created by other companies, I can't deny that a film like Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs is very hard not to love. Although it isn't particularly complex, thought-provoking, beautiful or masterful, it's a very entertaining, funny, cute-as-hell and effective animated film. Children with definitely love it, and adults... well, that actually depends on the adult in question. Although I certainly enjoy all kinds of movies, there's always - for me - some satisfaction to be had when watching something so obviously goofy and kiddy. Meatballs is kiddy, and that's precisely what I loved about it. It may not be this year's best animated movie - that honour goes to Pixar's Up - but it certainly is better than the likes of Monsters vs. Aliens.<br/><br/>The film tells the story of Flint Lockwood (voice of Bill Hader), a young inventor who dreams of, someday, creating something that will be loved by everyone and make him more popular and, most importantly, improve the lives of everyone in town. Unfortunately, he hasn't been able to do so, and his technofobic father (voice of James Caan) doesn't really help at all. One day, though, he manages to invent something that will change the lives of everyone in town forever: a machine that makes food fall from the sky. Everybody seems to be happy with him now - including mayor Shelbourne (Bruce Campbell) and the by-the-book police offer, Earl (Mr. T) - but, predictably enough, something goes wrong: excess amounts of food start to overload the island where the town is located, and now Flint, along with TV reporter Sam Sparks (Anna Faris) has to try to solve their problem.<br/><br/>Yes, the plot is pretty predictable, and it certainly won't make anyone above the age of 5 be shocked with surprise or anything of the sort, but it certainly is very imaginative, and it should work in a very ""oh, it's sort of nice"" kind of way. I liked the way Flint was portrayed - Hader's wacky and not-so-recognizable voice is perfect for the character - and the fact that, although most characters are either archetypes or stereotypes - consider, for the example, Bruce Campbell's greedy and - eventually - obese mayor - they are all voice so professionally and characterized in such an naive and cute kind of way, that one just doesn't care. I rooted for Flint the whole way, and I actually thought that the romantic sub-plot between him and Sam was cute and funny.<br/><br/>Visually, I don't think the movie is on par to the likes of Wall-E or Up, but I think that comparing it to those productions would be a bit unfair. Wall-E had a sort-of realistic kind of look, and Up, while a little more cartoonish, had a very realistic flair to it. On the other hand, there's something very old-fashioned in Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs' look and the way it is animated. Characters behave and move the way old TV cartoons behaved forty or more years ago, and I like that. They jump a lot, are very ""agile"" and are just... cartoonish. Clearly, the animators didn't want the movie to give a palpable sense of realism; in a way, they were trying to craft an old-fashioned cartoon with the latest technological tools, and they have done it very successfully.<br/><br/>What else can I say about the movie? It certainly is very naive, and it doesn't explore any deep themes or moral problems, but that's just OK. While this year's mediocre Monsters vs. Aliens was terribly simplistic, Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs is just simple, and there's nothing wrong with that. Of course, there's nothing wrong with movies like Wall-E having very significant messages and complex love stories and such, but if a parent wants to go with their toddler to see a movie that isn't very complicated but that isn't stupid or boring either, then Meatballs is an excellent choice. After all, even if there isn't much beneath the surface, I can't imagine a single adult maintaining a straight face throughout the film's runningtime. The movie is hilarious, - just remember Flint's father's eyebrows! -, it's inventive, it's imaginative; it's also pretty gorgeous and it features some effective voice acting and interesting, wacky characters. It's not dumb and it doesn't pander to the least common denominator. Most interestingly, though, it made me hungry. That's not a quality many movies posses."

","I just had the opportunity to see cloudy with a chance of meatballs in Dolby 3D, and to say the least it was amazing! I am a huge fan of this book, and have been looking forward to the release of this movie for months, however if you go into this moving hoping that its following the storyline of the book then you have it all wrong. It definitely was a KNOCKOUT in 3D, the animation was amazing and the hair on the characters looked so real that I could touch it! The storyline was extremely easy to follow, and the characters were so fun loving, especially the monkey 'steve', you felt sympathy for the town and the hard time they were going through, up until crazy scientist flint came in and made it rain cheeseburgers! In 3D it honestly looked good enough to eat, with spurts of mustard, cheese and the burger patties flopping right in front of me. I would definitely suggest seeing this film in 3D, i feel as if the writers made this film specifically to be shown in 3D, however thats not to say they rely on the 3D aspect for the film to be good. With or without the 3-D animation, this film is an amazing family film, extremely funny, and it makes you 'ice' screaming for more!"

","'Cloudy With A Chance of Meatballs' may as well be called the funniest animated film of the year, because I have never laughed as much as I did at an animated movie.Parents, I guarantee you that if you go see this movie with your kids, you will be in for one hilarious and exciting ride that makes this film almost as good as 'Up'.<br/><br/>Flint Lockwood has been an inventor ever since he was a kid, but most of his inventions have been failures.He has made a walking television set, a lotion that can give you hair, and rat birds, which I claim to be rats and birds combined together.It then hits him.The whole town has been forced to eat nothing but sardines.Of course, nobody in the town of Swallow Falls enjoy sardines.There's also a heading in the newspaper that says sardines are gross.What if Flint can fix all of that? What if he can invent a machine that converts water into food? Well, he tries it and it actually works.Soon, everyone in Swallow Falls love Flint's invention.What's even better is that it will give you any food you want.Pizza, french fries, mashed potatoes, jello, ice cream, bacon, cheeseburgers, eggs, cheese, steak, olives, toast, donuts, and so on.Unfortantly for Swallow Falls, things get much worse.The food starts to get bigger and causes the town and everyone else in the world nothing but destruction and chaos.It's now up to Flint to save the day from what may be a food apocalypse.<br/><br/>Me and my friend sat in our seats, laughed endlessly, and couldn't wait until the DVD came out.When it does, I'll be sure to get it on the first day.If not the first day, I'll be sure to get it and watch it over and over again."

","Sony Pictures Animation have had mixed success in comparison to the more established studios like Pixar, Dreamworks and Blue Sky with their films coming out at the wrong time with Open Season opening after the glut of talking animal films and Surf's Up which opened after Happy Feet but with Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs, SPA has finally found a hit film, the animation is stunning especially the water and the food weather and unlike say, Shrek the look is cartoony but works in its favour, the voice actors are equally as good with Bill Hader as Flint, Mr T as Earl and Anna Faris as Sam but it's Steve the Monkey who steals the film. The story itself works very well expanding on the original book and while the second half lags a bit, overall I left the cinema both with a smile and hungry.<br/><br/>If The Smurfs and Hotel Transylvania are half as good as Cloudy then Sony Pictures Animation will continue to thrive."
"mrmac-1","8","3","3","15 June 2010"," Superb animation, wonderful story
","Truly great animation, with the expressions of the eyes reminiscent of anime. A story that is about the child within each of us, yet all the while considering the risks involved during the whole of life. This is a story about innocence, in the true meaning of ""knowing oneself completely"" and all that this implies. It is also a story very much about the importance of imagination and creativity.<br/><br/>I am a child and an adult. What I've been taught, not entirely by just my fellow human beings, is that judgment is never productive. At its best, it is a desire to share with others something we do or do not appreciate. At its worst, it is a shutting down of the connection we have with each other. Perhaps a more productive way of sharing opinions about anything might be making distinctions between what is appreciated about the thing, and what is not, and the reasons for both aspects of these thoughts/feelings. This story actually addresses this tough issue, while entertaining us with a romp and a grand adventure.<br/><br/>My appreciation of this film is that it inspires me to laugh at myself (it's quite funny), at us, and my culture. And all the while, it is kind. The story and animation are tremendously imaginative, a quality I've found missing in many stories, animated or not. One of the themes, if not the main thread of the story, is that we humans are creative beings, and that, while this involves risks, we must express our imagination or take the greater risk of becoming stuck, stale and static, living only in the past tense.<br/><br/>The greatest compliment I can give this film is that I want my 2-year-old granddaughter to see it, for I am absolutely sure she will enjoy it almost as much as I have at age 61.<br/><br/>Greg Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania"

People who have read the book and remember it clearly do not have to read the following, but I feel like many people have forgotten about the book. This is the story of Flint Lockwood (voice of Bill Hader), who ever since childhood has wanted to invent something everyone would love. After screwing up many inventions, including putting spray on shoes that don't come off on himself, he invents a machine that converts water into food. I want to explain something. He lives on an island named Swallow Falls that only eats sardines because there is nothing else to eat. Now, when he makes food fall from the sky, everyone loves him. The film is funny, and sweet, and out of all the kids films I've seen in 3D this year, this is the one that uses its 3D to the fullest effect so far this year, but that might change.

A lot of movies and even animations likely don't cut enough, however ""Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs"" never slows even slightly.

","Execution is awkward. There's a cute story here, somewhere. But the presentation is so random, so rushed, that it's hard to follow what these people are supposed to be doing. And why. Adults will be annoyed with the off-kilter delivery, kids will be lost.<br/><br/>There are some decent visuals and sight gags. The outhouse lab entrance is very clever, for example. But, like so many other things: when it's introduced, it zooms by like a blur. Characters come out of nowhere; perform a scene; disappear. I liked how the story brought together a shy couple with parallel back stories, but even this wasn't developed very well. Many times there's unbridled action with vivid colors, but what's going on? Pivotal characters like the bushy eyebrow dad could have been explained to the audience better. Many characters like the cop and the mayor are just stereotypes that never change, even though the story needs them to. And the guy in the chicken suit? Talk about random; what was up with that?<br/><br/>On the plus side, it's certainly got enough slapstick, silliness, and wild action for younger kids. They probably won't follow half of what's happening, but they may not care, anyway. The inventor, the weather reporter, and the sardine store owner are likable heroes. The animation technology is handled pretty well.<br/><br/>Good enough for a rental, but you'll probably want to watch it only once."

","I was excited when I saw that there would be a movie coming out about my favorite book as a child, but this movie is so different than the book that I was very disappointed. Not only was it different, but it was not even remotely amusing. I ended up turning it off because it was dull. The characters were rather irritating and childish. I felt like no thought or imagination was given to this movie. From first glance, it looked as though it would be good, but the reviews were horrible and it was a major disappointment. I know this may seem harsh, but this movie is trash. About the only thing that was interesting was the cinematography, but even that couldn't keep me watching. I do not recommend."

","Cloudy with a chance of meatballs is not a complete failure. The print I saw was very well made, as was the box it shipped in, I'm sure. As for all other aspects of this stinker, the word FAIL applies unfailingly. I will not reveal any of the exciting story elements, since it would be too much a shock to my system to replay the stream of boredom. In fact, it could harm me in some way.<br/><br/>Where to begin: Meandering, charmless score. HUGE orchestration of what sounds like random cut and paste music from 20 different composers. Whoever 'composed' this 800 pound slug of a score was a bit too enthusiastic in the 'lets honor the film composers of the past!' department.<br/><br/>Thin to non-existent character development. you don't CARE about the characters in this little picture, since you are almost killed by boredom by the wooden dialog. Ghastly demonstration of how to make an audience not care one little bit.<br/><br/>Clever animation techniques marred by amateur-hour art-school reject textures. A look that keeps wandering back and forth between photo-realism and 60's surrealistic animation styles. Jarring inconsistencies and amateur animation style management.<br/><br/>VERY sloppy dialog track so poorly mixed you could hardly detect where the character voices were supposed originate from. Overall, a cheapy-quickie little picture on huge (squandered) budget, mismanaged and mangled into the record books of bad film-making. Shameful. Wasteful.<br/><br/>The story seals the fate of this stinker: I have not read the book, but it must have been more developed than this horror. This film could put a 7 year old on triple sugar rations asleep in 4 minutes. This thing is filled with undeveloped plot devices, paper thin back stories, pretentious 'Father/Son' conflict element that remains lifeless and dull throughout the entire picture. In short: brightly colored pap for 3 year olds. Could have saved a fortune shooting a puppet show at the local carnival.<br/><br/>Poor Sony - nothing, and I mean NOTHING is working anymore. This should be the final tombstone for Sony Animation. Put it down, Mr. Stringer, for it is dead and hanging off the diseased studio like a gangrenous foot. Better to chop the blackened fetid limb that allow it to kill the entire sickly studio.<br/><br/>Avoid this film unless you are studying catastrophe theory, or need to place young ones into a catatonic stupor."

The hopeful but incompetent young lady might not be sexist if she weren't also such an embarrassing cliché.<br/><br/>Animation: positive proof that full-scale computer animation doesn't add value by itself.

","(Warning: This Review May Contain Spoilers) (It may also contain comments about the movie ) 5 out of 10 because while this movie is watchable, I will avoid watching it again.Most of the movie felt forced, like an amateur stand up comedian who's act is slowly dieing on stage. The movie was basically just a flashy tribute to the book on which it is based and the only things that draw's the viewers attention is the ability to see classic children's story come to life, and to see what it would be like for the weather to be made of food. Many of the jokes were repetitive to the point of annoyance, including the ""saying what I'm doing"" montages. The first one got a chuckle from me, but I thought ""well, that was okay, but I hope they don't try to do it again"". Unfortunately, they did. Most of the characters were unlovable, except for possibly the dad, who's inability to use technology or to express his emotions will inevitable get some sympathy from the audience. The main character and his 'love interest' were both shallow and annoying and showed no depth nor development of character. The only thing genuinely funny was hearing the monkey's thought-comments occasionally throughout the movie. The effect was somewhat reminiscent of GIR from Invader Zim, in the cute brainless robot monkey sort of way. Overall, it seems the only point of the plot was as excuse to visualize different forms of food-weather such as an Ice-cream Christmas and Spaghetti Tornado. Of course you might say this is the only point of the original book as well. I must admit, I am being a bit harsh as I was looking forward to this movie and was quite unimpressed. But this seems to be the trend with movies these days. Movies are a business and good writing doesn't sell tickets as well as flashy CGI."

","Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs (PG, 1:30) — SF, 2nd string, original, OSIT romantics<br/><br/>As Edmund Gwenn, best known for his role as Kris Kringle in Miracle on 34th Street, lay on his deathbed, a sorrowing visitor sympathized that dying must be hard. ""No,"" replied Gwenn, ""dying is easy; comedy is hard!""<br/><br/>So too with trying to get any respect for comedy in movies. Take Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs, for instance. It's a constant delight, chock-full of visual and verbal humor, but because it's (a) animated, (b) skiffy, and (c) not intended to be a (here lower voice an octave) ""serious work"", nobody will take it seriously. Too dang bad! A soufflé may be light, fluffy, and not very filling, but it too is tasty and requires careful attention to keep it from being ruined.<br/><br/>The plot premise (based on the book by Judi and Ron Barrett) is slight: wacky tinkerer invents machine that makes food from water vapor. That would be Flint Lockwood (voiced by Bill Hader), and the food-making machine with the unpronounceable acronym is just the latest in a long line of gadgets, gimmicks, and goo he's been dreaming up since he was a little kid with a wall full of Tesla posters and a supportive mom.<br/><br/>The movie starts with the question ""Have you ever felt that you were a little different?"", ostensibly referring to Flint but inescapably hooking all the guy geeks in the audience. Not long afterward, the gal geeks get their role model in the form of Sam Sparks (Anna Faris, world's best sport from the various Scary Movies), intern for the Weather News Network who's been hiding her brains beneath a bimbette facade. In a conventional movie, the mousy little office assistant would take off her glasses, let down her hair, be transformed into, say, Maureen O'Hara, and win the heart of the guy. Here it's done in reverse, as Sam puts on big googly glasses, does her hair up in a ponytail, and lets her intellect shine thru, thereby winning the hearts of Flint and all the nerds like me.<br/><br/>The island community of Swallow Falls (hidden behind the ""A"" in Atlantic) has fallen on hard times, as demand for its primary product, sardines, has fallen off with global realization that sardines are, well, gross. The town, led by ambitious and semi-scrupulous Mayor Shelbourne (Bruce Campbell), is trying to reinvent itself as a destination for sardine tourism and has enlisted its poster boy, Baby Brent, the Gerber's icon of sardines, to help cut the ribbon on Sardine Land — except that Brent (Andy Samberg) is now a hulking, narcissistic playboy. Nonetheless, things are going OK until Flint takes advantage of the occasion to plug his foodmaker into the town's bazillion-gigajoule power station and ends up rocketing thru the festivities, trailing calamity and disapproval in his wake, until the machine shoots off into the stratosphere, leaving Flint nervously facing a galaxy of lowered eyebrows.<br/><br/>His gruff dad, Tim (James Caan), suggests that maybe the inventor thing isn't working out all that well and that Flint should settle in as the junior partner in the family sardine bait and tackle business. And our lad seems resigned to that fate ... until food starts falling from the sky and he becomes (temporarily) the town hero. But the food keeps falling. And it's getting bigger. Oh-oh.<br/><br/>OK, some quick stuff. There are ratbirds. Steve the monkey speaks English but thinks only monkey thots, particularly about Gummi Bears. Flint has the world's best-developed treehouse. It contains the master control for the foodmaker, including a seldom-consulted Dangeometer. Sam has a serious peanut allergy. Manny the Guatemalan surgeon/pilot/engineer is humble and taciturn but the most competent immigrant in world history. Unwarranted optimism abounds, as embodied in the phrase ""This probably won't explode."" Mr. T gets a paycheck. And I haven't even touched on the solution to the world's greatest problem: untied shoelaces.<br/><br/>It's in Imax and 3-D. Are they worth the extra price? For something as much fun as this, why stint? (I'm sure Mayor Shelbourne would agree.) Comedy may be hard, but when it really works, enjoying it is easy."

The writers didn't overwhelm us with thousands of disconnected subplots, which is something more movies nowadays need to work on. I liked how they tweaked the story a little from the book, but it also stuck to the idea very well.<br/><br/>The characters were very enjoyable. Flint was funny, smart, and lovable. He was the perfect main character. His chemistry with Sam was flawless. And who could forget Steve, Flint's pet monkey with the Thought Translater strapped to him. I loved him! He was hilarious and cute, saying random things all the time.<br/><br/>The animation was incredible. The people were a bit cartoony, but well done.

"plasticanimalz","10","6","12","20 September 2009"," On Par With Pixar
","I feel I need to make a comment, simply to dispute FordPrefect-42's completely inaccurate portrayal of this film. I can't imagine what pedestal of animation quality he holds to other films and what films those are if he considers CWACOM only ""simple"" animation? I saw the film with about 20 animators, all from major studios, in their 20's and 30's and everyone absolutely loved the film and raved about it. I've worked in animation for 12 years and I'm happy to see that someone else is finally making films equally as good as any Pixar movies. The film was engrossing from beginning to end. The script was excellent, the voice acting was fantastic, the animation was great, and it was highly inventive and creative. It was clever, all the characters were highly likable, and I laughed out loud at least 3 times, which, I almost never do. I absolutely love this movie and rank it up there with my Pixar faves, along with Iron Giant. You can tell that a lot of love and care went into this film as opposed to the typical studio, churn out, beat something to death and market the crap out of something. And very few studios do that anymore, other than Pixar and some smaller indie productions. It's all about the big money machine rather than letting artists and creatives do what they do best, which is sad and a shame. There is a reason why Pixar and TV animation studios like Cartoon Network and Nickelodeon deliver over and over again. And that is because they trust the artists and animation professionals to do their job that they're trained to do and don't try to tamper with the creative process by throwing executives with zero creative or animation experience into the mix. Their is no better way to kill a film or show than let a team of creative execs. with no writing experience write the outline for the project. Cough...Disney. Get a clue people. Having a studio exec. with a law degree tell an animator with $150,000 animation education what he should be doing is a recipe for a heartless pile of crud. Hopefully, with success like Cloudy With A Chance Of Meatballs, execs will finally realize that animators other than Pixar actually know what they're doing and release their choke hold that has been killing the life out of any good animation for the past 15 years."
"Floated2","3","7","15","12 August 2010"," Great visuals but lacking in story
","Cloudy with a chance of meatballs is an animated comedy. This movie was pretty boring and plain ridiculous (even for an animated film). I know its a kid movie but the plot was so weird and not realistic. Because most of the time, they are missing the heart and inspiration that Pixar has. Cloudy with a chance of meatballs is one of those animated films. It's missing the heart and there isn't much inspiration put into the film. Its pretty predictable and very easy to tell what will happen and how the film will end. This is the story of a scientist named Flint (Bill Hader). He is a likable character. The problem with his inventions are that none of them actually work. He also works at his dad's(James Caan) work. His inventions blow until he invents a machine that causes food to rain from the sky.<br/><br/>Flint meets a newscaster(voiced by Anna Farris) who he soon falls for. The film is funny at sometimes but in general its really not. And the movie keeps your attention for the most part. But in the last half hour, the film gets awfully stupid. There is a scene in which Flint, Sam, the newscaster, and a retarded Sardine's representative (Andy Samburg)are going into a huge ball of food. Eventually, pizza slices try to blow them up. And once they get in the cave, these creepy looking turkeys come alive and try to kill them. That is how stupid the movie is.<br/><br/>I thought the movie could have added more and could have used Mr. T's character and his son more. Some of the other characters were just boring and not that great. Don't let the critics and ratings fool you, this movie is not that great"

He laughed and even clapped at times. I noticed as the movie went on that my little companion was slouching and holding his stomach. The bright vivid food that continuously fell from the sky was so overwhelming. It was so colorful that it hurt my eyes. The suggestion that was set forth hurt my stomach. I noticed that my companion seemed to feel the same. I thoroughly enjoyed the children's book; however, this movie destroyed all chances that I would be reading it again. The colors in the book were soft and southing. That way you could actually concentrate on the storyline. I am not recommending that anyone, young or old, see this movie. It is truly terrible."
"dtb","10","5","10","19 September 2009"," Big Food and Big Fun in Animated Adaptation of Beloved Book
","CLOUDY WITH A CHANCE OF MEATBALLS (CWACOM), based on the beloved 1978 children's book by Judi and Ron Barrett, is almost Pixar-level good! My family and I saw this animated treat in 2D rather than 3D because we wanted to take advantage of a local theater's morning matinée. However, we didn't miss the 3D effects in this vivid, playful, rollicking adaptation; we were having too much fun! Written and directed by Phil Lord and Christopher Miller, CWACOM deftly combines the warmth of a Pixar film with the zany sight gags of a Looney Tunes cartoon. The movie also expands entertainingly on the book's premise about the little town of Chewandswallow (in the film, the town is part of an economically-depressed island, Swallow Falls), where food drops from the sky like rain, with surreally madcap results. The film gives the townspeople more personality, including an endearingly awkward protagonist, young scientist wannabe Flint Lockwood (voiced by Bill Hader). When Flint hits on a way to convert water into all manner of foodstuffs, saving his town from poverty and an all-sardine diet, he finally becomes a town hero after years of having his inventions laughed at. To our hero's frustration, his laconic but well-meaning dad isn't quite on board with his son's success yet, fearing he hasn't thought through the possible consequences. (This being an animated film, of course Flint's mom is the only person who believes in him, and of course she dies young.) Flint teams up with aspiring weather-gal Sam Sparks (Anna Faris), who's as ambitious and eager for acceptance as Flint is; merciless childhood teasing led Sam to hide her smarts behind her pretty face and perky personality. The film makes some good points about the pros and cons of craving other people's approval and over-sized food portions. Happily, Lord and Miller put all of this across with a light touch, a refreshing lack of sap and snark, and a super-size helping of hilarity and wit. We were pleasantly surprised to see that the majority of the laugh-out-loud funny gags aren't so ridiculously topical that they'll feel dated by the time the DVD comes out. :-) There are tips of the hat to classic science fiction movies, but those scenes will still be fun even if you've never seen the films in question. The gags aren't just funny, they're plentiful. In fact, our family would love to see CWACOM again to look for all the uproarious background sight gags we missed the first time around! Even Flint's posters of his scientist heroes are funny and clever, drawn to look like rock star pin-ups. There's a side-splitting payoff to every little running gag -- sometimes literally, like with the walking TV Flint invented. As chaos reigns late in the film, a looter carries off a TV -- and Flint's walking TV carries off the guy! (THE TWONKY, anyone? :-)) Spaghetti tornadoes with meatball meteors, feral Gummi bears on the attack, schools closed on account of falling giant pancakes -- what's not to like? The voice cast is terrific, too; in addition to Hader and Faris, we loved James Caan's imitation of James Gandolfini as Flint's dad; Bruce Campbell as the self-serving mayor; Andy Samberg as former sardine factory icon Baby Brent; Mr. T. as gung-ho cop and loving dad Earl; and my favorite, Benjamin Bratt, who's deadpan funny (yes, both Bratt's voice and his animated character's face are deadpan, smarty :-)) as an unassuming bystander who turns out to be a doctor, saving Earl's young son from his food coma: ""I came from Guatemala for a better life. Good thing, huh?"" As a side note, one plot element that particularly hit home for our family was Sam's peanut allergy; during a climactic action scene, she's scratched by knife-like shards of peanut brittle, resulting in a race against time to get her back to their ride so she can use her Epi-Pen before anaphylactic shock sets in. Our daughter could relate because of her own peanut/tree nut/sesame allergies. Of course, she carries her Epi-Pen everywhere (good girl)!"

","Cloudy with a chance of Meatballs is a awesome classic children's book, but it's doesn't chew right as a good movie. It's rainy cheese and it's somewhat smells bad. Flint Lockwood (Bill Hader) is a inventor whose contraptions end up not working as plan. His newest item accidentally unleashed on the world, turns out to be his biggest success. Flint Lockwood is able to turn the weather, into a food raining frenzy. The people quickly loves it, making friends out of enemies with overprotection cop Earl (Mr. T) and town mascot local hero 'Baby' Brett (Andy Sanberg) and slowly grew to like Flint for it. No one was as huge as a fan as the Mayor (Bruce Campbell) whoms seeks to make Flint's town of Shallows Falls into a tourism destination with help with weather girl Sam (Anna Faris). As the Swallow Falls residents become greedier with their daily meal requests, Flint's invention becomes more and more overheated -- until it leads to a culinary disaster that could destroy the world. In which in the end kind of does. In the end, Flint Lockwood does bring chaos and damage across the world, not counting the countless numbers of death cause by this doomsday machine that creates the hurricane of pasta and avalanche of leftovers. This age-appropriate 3-D food adventure doesn't fully satisfy at all. Parents need to know that this adaptation of the classic children's book is bound to attract the10-and-under set as show by it's lack of depth in the character development department. There's no emotional attachment to the main characters, the way you feel about others. The characters seems cookie cut, over the top cartoons and is a tad unengaged for adult and young adults audiences, who are by now used to more sophisticated animated films. For a character supposedly smart, most of the movie treats its viewers with stereotype common popcorn arch story lines, audiences see in other rush movies with boy meet girl, boy create chaos and fix it . Not every, main female character should end up liking the main male character. The movie seems quickly producted without looking for key things to stand out. The relationship between Sam and Flint was a bit disturbing in a stalker type of way. Yes, they are socially-awkward, smarter-than-you-might-think type of characters, but this film formula would be suite for films of PG or PG13 standards than young childs who doesn't know about relationship. Talking about relationship, although no grand life lessons are offered, the movie does center on a son's need for fatherly encouragement and the idea that you shouldn't compromise who you are just to be popular. They never really explain why Flint's father (James Caan) couldn't understood Flint, when its clearly in the opening shot that he approved of his work, and commonly helps Flint with his work. It's doesn't help that Flint doesn't want to get to know more about his father by trying to understand his life. We don't know what made Brett chances his opinion on Flint so much toward the end, when in the first quarter he clearly acts like a jerk as well. The movie, by comparison, seems like a cautionary tale about dependence on genetically modified ""techno-food"" -- a science experiment gone amok. There's nothing overtly age-inappropriate in the movie, expect a bit of salty language, some potty humor and and the occasional mild insult. The few tense/slightly scary scenes are weather- and giant food-related -- which could upset little kids who are sensitive to fears about natural disasters. The animation is mediocre at best. The food doesn't stick to people's clothing in some scenes, yet others it does. The leftovers don't grow old or look like it's smells. The body types don't match well with the animation. It's not that great, but the film seems like a step backward in serious sophisticated cartoons, even though it's an obvious transition into the profitable 3-D genre. The movie's plot is very different than the book's, so anyone expecting a straight adaptation will be disappointed. Give it a watch. If you can like the taste, you can eat it up, if not-- just spill it out."

Sure the story and the development of it isn't exactly the most original(Actually, it was pretty predictable) but it was still very funny to look at, mostly because of the great visuals: Instead of giving it a realistic look like in most of the recent animated films, the characters designs and the sceneries were stylish and surreal, and this made the film even more enjoyable.

I can see kids running out after watching this and looking for a bunch of old equipment to use to try and invent something cool. With that said, kids WILL LOVE this movie. No doubt about it. I can see many kids under the age of 10 finding this movie to be undoubtedly the best movie they have ever seen. Most adults, while shaking our heads at the sheer ridiculousness, will still find it to be a very enjoyable experience and a way above average animated film.<br/><br/>One of my favourite experiences from this movie, was hearing the uncontrollable laughter explode out of my daughter.

","I never expected this movie to be so good. I thought I knew the plot and what will happen, but this movie managed to surprise me. I found it to be very funny. A movie as imaginative as this one is hard to find, and combined to make it good and fun is a great thing. Also enhanced with 3D effects, the action was closer, the adventure more lively and the food tastier. However, this looks like a family film, but note the PG rating. It has many bloody and rude humor, that is not meant for younger viewers. This movie is more for preteens. But if you trust your kids, take them to see this movie, is a thrill ride from the start, and with such a hearty, great moral and message at the end, I can understand why some people cried in theaters.<br/><br/>This is sunny bright with a chance of success."

","Hey Mom & Dad. Are you dealing with a rainy day,with the kiddies driving you crackers with ""I'm so bored...There's nothing to do,today"" every five minutes? Then by gum,pack the whole gang in the car & drive on over to your local multiplex & treat the little ones to a screening of 'Cloudy With A Chance Of Meatballs' (and even if you have no little ones,still go to check it out---you'll be glad you did). This is Columbia/Sony Pictures contribution to the ever growing array of 3D-CGI (three dimension,computer generated images)animation. The screenplay,adapted from the beloved book by the authors themselves (Judi Barrett & Ron Barrett)doles out the fun factor a whopping 10+. The direction is handled well by Phil Lord & Chris Miller (both known for their work in television). The story:a little island township,mainly known for it's contribution to fishing is starving for tourism (there is literally nothing to eat but fish there). Flint Lockwood (voiced by Bill Hader,of Saturday Night Live,fame)is a failed inventor,who is trying to invent a machine that turns water into food, which goes bananas (ouch---bad pun!)& turns into a satellite that does manage to turn rain clouds into food that rains upon the island. Sam Sparks (voiced by Anna Faris,of the Scary Movie series)is the perky weather anchor of the local 'Weather News Channel' (obviously a double edged pun on the Weather Channel,as well as Cable News Network)is there to report on the proceedings (and perhaps forge a friendship with the nerdy,introverted Flint). Other familiar voices that turn up for good measure include,James Caan (as Flint's skeptical father,Tim), Bruce Campbell (as the rather shady Mayor Shelbourn),Mr. T (as a well meaning,but overly macho policeman,Earl Deveraux),and even Al Roker (from NBC's Today Show),as Patrick Patrickson,Benjamin Bratt & Neil Patrick Harris turn up to supply voices for some minor characters. This film is being released in both 3D Digital,as well as standard 2D versions (check your local newspaper for whatever cinemas are screening which version---although I would recommend the 3D edition). At the screening that I attended,both youngsters,as well as parents had a good old time with this one (as did I). Now, it's your turn. Rated PG by the MPAA,for some thematic element (although I would guess that it's being released as a PG,just to guarantee wider distribution,as I really didn't find anything that a parent would object to)."

","When I first saw the trailer for this film, the first thing that came to my mind was, ""A cute little flick for kids."" While this may be true, when I saw it, it forced me to rethink my original thoughts. Clever puns, dialog, physical gags and great animation fill the silver screen. This is right up there as one of the best animated films this year, along with ""Up"" & ""Coraline"". This film also has as much action as it does humor, sure to please both action fans and people who love a good comedy. Once again, I'd like to point out how well the animation and special effects of this film were done. This film is Sony Animation Studios best film and I recommend you go see it, or at the very least wait for it to come on video. Just sit back, relax and enjoy."
"redrum_9","10","3","5","27 September 2009"," A hilarious and surreal ride! One of the best modern animated features!
","This was a film I didn't have high expectations for. But I'm a fan of Bruce Campbell and I also like Anna Faris, and heard a review which made me want to see it immediately, so I decided to go and see it. And I loved it! <br/><br/>Most comedy films coming out today have many jokes, but unfortunately all bad ones, because the problem is that they try too hard to be funny, and it just doesn't work. In 'Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs' the humour is natural. They have a hilariously absurd situation (food falling from sky) and some lovely characters, great voice-overs which help to bring some great jokes, and shows that they are still people around in the film industry who have a good sense of humour.<br/><br/>The visuals are stunning, surrealistic and sometimes even dark, especially if you think about the fact that it's an animated kids film. The animators sure did a great job. This is one the few animated newer animated films which actually has an atmosphere ('Wall-E' being another example). The film has a variety of things such as walking roasted chickens, a guy with a macaroni on his head, multicoloured clouds which increases this absurd surrealistic feel that the film has.<br/><br/>Over nearly 2 hours you regularly see different foods falling from the sky, but interestingly enough, it never bores you, because every time a good joke is added, and you can enjoy the visuals. This means the film is working.<br/><br/>I think this film might be one of the year's best if not the best. Clearly it has an intention of being memorable, and not just one of those little animated film you see once with your children, and then forget about it a week after. This is a film that males/females, adults/children can enjoy from beginning to end. It's a film that succeeds on many levels. I've seen it in 3D, which I do not believe in, and I am sure that a 2D experience is as good, and enjoyable for everyone. So don't let 3D fool you, just sit back in any dimension and enjoy this wonderful modern animated feature."

"landonlegate","4","4","8","12 June 2017"," A Terrible Movie
","Back in 2009,a movie base on the book came out called Cloudy With A Chance Of Meatballs. It had received positive reviews and was a box office success. To be honest, I hate this movie. And today I will explain why.<br/><br/>The Story: The plot is not really that original, it is the same story where the guy is a loser, then he becomes famous, then the thing he did goes haywire, and now he has to fix it. The story does nothing original and its filled with clichés. But I will admit, the concept of them starting off eating sardines and then they have food falling from the sky is creative. Also I really like the father son relationship in the movie. But none of those positives of the story can not save it.<br/><br/>The Animation: Some positives I have with the animation is that the food animation is really good and colorful. Also the backgrounds look nice. But the terrible thing about it is the character designs and the character animation. The character designs look awful and just disgusting to look at. Also the animation is way to cartoony and over the top that is just makes it look unappealing. This makes the animation some of the worst looking animation I have ever seen in my life.<br/><br/>The Characters: Besides Flint, the Mayor, and Flints dad, all the characters have no purpose and are just filler. Sam is obnoxious, Baby Brent is a idiot, and the mayor is a stupid idiot. These characters can get very annoying. But, some characters can actually be likable. One being Earl, his heart is in the right place and wants to care of his son. Also Flints dad Tim Lockwood, also wants to take care of his son and just wants him to be safe. But the worst character is the protagonist himself, Flint Lockwood. Not only is he obnoxious, but the things he does is idiotic.<br/><br/>Cloudy With A Chance Of Meatballs is over-hyped and is a terrible movie with horrible writing, annoying characters, and some of the worst animation in the history of cinema.<br/><br/>Story: 4/10 Animation: 3/10 Characters: 4/10 Overall: 4/10"

Now, there are a lot of studios but they stock stinker after stinker. <br/><br/>Sure, the animation is bright, colored, full of details but the characters are rather ugly: the heroes are realistic and cute while the others are caricatures: short legs, explosive belly, enormous eyebrows. Worst, the story is dumb: it's about a food storm! Where do they find their ideas? Maybe it's better than a poop tempest but falling steaks, swimming in cream is finally disgusting. It's nearly Ferriri's Big Feast for kids but there wasn't a lot of funny moments. I forget the philosophic message that is to be yourself!

"bonniejoy-978-68763","2","5","11","29 April 2014"," Cloudy with a Chance of Cliché!
","I grew up reading the simple picture book Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs. It simply about a grandpa telling the kids a bedtime story about a town whose weather always consists of meals. For example, if it was windy hamburgers would blow in, it would snow ice cream, rain hot dogs or orange juice, and so on! However it eventually grew dangerous for the town to stay in, so everyone had to evacuate the town. I would read this book while eating alone, and the story never got old!<br/><br/>When I saw the trailer for the upcoming movie I was very excited! I was aware that it would be about the town itself and an inventor and I thought, ""What could go wrong?"" After seeing it, I began to want a refund near the beginning of the third act. <br/><br/>What should I start with about what's wrong? Let's start with everything I found painfully predictable: 1) Dead mother 2) Grieving father who's not thrilled with his nerdy kid. 3) The reporter is a nerd too. Oh it's a match made in Heaven! 4) All nerds get tossed aside, even on news cameras. 5) Invention goes wrong. 6) Added villains (or at least one I want to use as a punchbag) 7) Nerdy inventor saves the town. 8) Father's heartfelt speech at the end of the movie about how proud mother would be if she could see this. 9) Throughout the entire movie, the inventor must prove himself worthy to his father.<br/><br/>I don't have much a problem with the last cliché, but the story must be clever; which this flick wasn't! I also mind that the story was made into an ""America is Fat"" message. Please don't tell me that after seeing this movie you couldn't see that message written in bold capital words with examples like the extremely creepy mayor, especially with his theme, ""the bigger the better."" That wasn't the theme of the book! The weather always existed, there was no machine to make it happen or enlarge the food sizes, nor was there an overeating mayor, and worst of all the food wasn't alive at the end! Oh I could barf at that! It's at the scene when the inventor and his girlfriend go to shut down the machine, but as they get closer, the food fights back! I'm not kidding. As soon as I saw that I said to myself, ""Okay, game over! I hate this movie!""<br/><br/>I often think that Hollywood has a tendency to take simple beloved children's books and turn them into forced morals, which I hate! Some adaptations of children's books are okay, but when they're done in a way to shove in morals we've heard so much then enough's enough! I don't mind the idea of the weather being created through a machine (though I still wonder what would happen if it really rained) but this film just spat in the book's face, and it becomes even more painfully obvious in the sequel!"

","Wiki has a good critic line that sums up this movie: ""This film wasn't made for you, or me. It was made for dangerously, easily distracted 9-year-olds."" So I guess nowadays children are granted to have ADHD, and this kind of entertainment is the only thing that can keep them focused on something.<br/><br/>As for movie itself - it's quality is below criticism.<br/><br/>Character design? Ridiculous for the sake of ridiculous. Voiceacting? Average. Music? Hardly. Plot? **It happens. It always gets resolved. Romance ensued. Oh, and the protagonist just has to be a special snowflake Peter Parker. In every single cartoon. Can Hollywood produce anything else? Humor? Scary Movie 5 has better humor. Or perhaps at least the same level of humor. Premise? Clinically crazy. Even taking it as an infant cartoon... What happened to Lilo and Stich? Lion King? Eh - any cartoon that is thoughtful and deep? Where romance and daddy issues are not the major sellers?<br/><br/>What kind of rating do parodies have? Meet the Spartans? Scary Movie? About 3\10. And that's from a fan. Now I will not go insane pondering how this baloney got 7\10+. Why do I give it 4\10? Because while it is on the production quality of parody comedy - it's at least presentable to children.<br/><br/>But seriously, I feel sorry for you and your children if you really adore this kind of... cuisine."

At the end it even gets worse: The movie becomes disgusting (the absolutely unfunny baby-guy turns into a fried chicken!?).<br/><br/>Sorry, but this movie just is not funny and i regret having watched it. Don't waste your time on this and rather watch one of the other animated movies. There are so many good ones out there."
"Red_Flag","10","5","11","26 September 2009"," It brightened up my day.
","Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs is a vague title. So much so that its almost off-putting. My first though after seeing the trailer was that this film is strictly for the youngsters; something you might leave them at while the parents go see something considerably more adult. Truthfully, this couldn't be any further from the truth. Cloudy with a chance of Meatballs is no only one of the most entertaining animated movies thus far but it's one of the best movies I've seen all year. Now i know what you're thinking. This guy has lost all credibility, there's no way this could be on par with Pixar's outing. You know what; if I were you I wouldn't believe me either. Honestly though. The film has masterfully written material and production values to die for. Each scene is crafted with care and a keen eye for the obscure.<br/><br/>Inspired by Ron and Judi Barrett's beloved children's book of the same name, Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs follows inventor Flint Lockwood (voice of Bill Hader) and a brainy weathergirl Sam Sparks (voice of Anna Faris) as they attempt to discover why the rain in their small town has stopped, and food is falling in its place. Meanwhile, lifelong bully Brent (voice of Adam Samberg) relishes in tormenting Flint like he did when they were kids, and Mayor Shelbourne (voice of Bruce Campbell) schemes to use Flint's latest invention -- a device designed to improve everyone's lives -- for his own personal gain. Mr. T. voices by-the-books cop Earl Devereaux, and James Caan voices Flint's technophobe father Tim.<br/><br/>Cloudy managed to get its fundamentals out of the way rather quickly. While most animated features these day will rely on the cliché, Cloudy braches out in to the vague and at times downright obscure. Don't get me wrong there is a lot for children to enjoy here. The artistry is astounding and the sight gags are constantly amusing but the real hilarity comes from the jokes aimed at adults. Its perplexing but magnificent when 9/10 of every joke told hits dead on. This is an outright guarantee, you'll be laughing throughout 50% of the film. The other 50% you'll be spent in outright awe of the visuals which are unmatched by today's standards. Much like the graphic kids books its based off ""Cloudy"" certainly has its own art style, whether or not you like it is all down to taste.<br/><br/>""Cloudy"" looks phenomenal. Every inch of the film is innovative, and jaw dropping. Though not for everybody. The animation style is extremely over the top and eccentric. If your sensitive to flashing colour, or you though ""Speed Racer"" was an ugly film your likely to have a similar problem here. No matter your taster there no denying the outright beauty of the final act which sees several unbelievable set pieces made cleverly out of food. It's this innovation that makes me so positive towards this, one of the best films of the year.<br/><br/>Verdict: Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs is one of the funniest films of the year - a hugely enjoyable, superbly written and brilliantly animated comedy that'll send you out of the cinema grinning from ear to ear. Unmissable entertainment. Modestly, Meatballs opens with the dedication: ""A film by . . . a lot of people."" Well done, a lot of people. You've made a lot of other people very happy. And hungry. 5/5."

","Rating-8/10<br/><br/>Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs is a charming animation full of great designs, voices and jokes and that all makes this a movie that all the family can enjoy. It doesn't lack the laughs as I say and some parts make you laugh out loud, the story is a little crazy but if you go a long with it then you will thoroughly enjoy it. I thought it to be solidly a very good movie and here below is why so.<br/><br/>The plot is random but all about food and so if you are eager to get hungry whilst watching a film then this is the one to see. The plot I did feel goes just a little fast but in any case you can really enjoy it and yet again, if you get into the flow of it all, you really like it. It is funny and surprised me, it genuinely has funny jokes and things going on and the creative side of the movie is so richly made you will love the heart of it's creation.<br/><br/>The voice cast are strong and people such as Bill Hader and Anna Faris contribute brilliantly with there voices. I loved the animation style here and the movement is a little unrealistic but hey, it's an animation basically aimed towards kids so it is just good old fun. With people like James Caan, Mr T and Andy Samberg this film really throws random people at you but they totally work out.<br/><br/>Phil Lord and Chris Miller direct and write this and do a great job, they masterfully make this funny and sweet, yet also good fun to watch so that by the end, people from 6 to 60 can be joyful at what they just saw. The detail in the animation is kind of basic but when it comes to the food, well it is beautiful and the movie does seem a lot to make food which isn't so nice, actually look pretty delicious. <br/><br/>My main criticism probably comes with the end, I wasn't too keen on the final scenes and what happens etc, mostly because the movie is very along one line then BAM! The ending creates a whole new side twist(some may love the ending though). Some jokes are repeated but hey they are funny in the first place so I don't think there are a lot of places where you can poke holes in this piece.<br/><br/>You may expect me to recommend to this to children, well I do because children should love it, the plot and the comedy will make kids laugh and have a great bit of fun. With the adults well, the plot may not draw in older people as much but the jokes should find your funny bone somewhere along the line and you may find this one gem of an animation, and a film you may want to see again one day.<br/><br/>Overall I give this a 8/10 and felt it to be a Solidly Impressive movie and one which comes close to animation greatness. I think a recurring theme in this review is that adults can also enjoy this and I can't stress that enough, if any kids out there are reading this review and you loved the film, then spread the word to every adult in the world that not every animation aimed at kids, is only made for the kids."

For laugh out loud moments it beats such brilliance as Up!, even if it does rely on it's ridiculous plot to see us through.

The colours are superb, the backgrounds are lush and the characters are well-modelled. The best of the visuals is the one with the spaghetti tornado, utterly jaw-dropping in every sense of the word. The score is quirky and fun, with a nice end credits song, while the story is very original and imaginative. The script is another strength, so many funny moments without feeling too much.<br/><br/>The voice acting is wonderful, bringing to life characters that are appealing, charming and quirky. Bill Hader does a great job as the eccentric Flint, while Anna Farris is wonderful as bubbly Sam. James Caan is good also as Flint's father and Bruce Campbell is a great surprise as the mayor who swells as a consequence of eating the falling food. My only complaints are the pacing;some scenes felt rushed so we weren't given as much time as we would've liked to breathe while some towards the end dragged, and the repetition of ""I love you son"" and such got a tad too mushy. Overall, this film is very good and enjoyable. 8/10 Bethany Cox"
"Movie_Muse_Reviews","8","2","3","28 March 2010"," Exceptionally clever, goofy, food-falling fun
","""Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs"" is about the closest any major CGI animation studio has come to a classic cartoon done in a modern style. It would appear that somewhere between ""Looney Tunes"" and Pixar's ""Up"" that animation has lost a bit of its rule-bending nature. Phil Lord and Chris Miller, co-executive producers of CBS comedy ""How I Met Your Mother"" and the short-lived cult favorite ""Clone High"" have restored that sense of abstract physical humor in Judi and Ron Barrett's book while infusing it with a modern sense of humor.<br/><br/>You know what I'm talking about: the old cartoons where a TNT explosion or a gunshot would would merely blow all the fur or feathers off (temporarily) of a character. ""Meatballs"" isn't that old school, but at one point, our narrator, the fearlessly crazy inventor Flint Lockwood (voiced by Bill Hader of ""SNL"") is hiding off the side of a dock after ruining his hometown's big celebration with a presumably failed invention meant to turn water into food. His eventual love interest Sam (Anna Faris) walks to the pier, sits down and accidentally slams her heels into his mega-sized eyeballs. It's the good old concept of animated films being aware of their fictional fantasy world and not being so transfixed on creating realism, which many animated features have in this computer age.<br/><br/>Sony Pictures Animation has only continued to get better, with their last film, ""Surf's Up,"" being on the more fun and wacky side for animated features as well. ""Meatballs"" continues that idea with exaggerated characteristics like bug-eyes on all the characters and general silliness, but the writing is what ties it all together and really nicely.<br/><br/>When we're first introduced to Flint, we get to see his many inventions that have gone wrong. But rather than make it just a fun one-minute bit, it's a recurring joke throughout the film. The flying ratbirds that he invents pop up countless times throughout the film and his monkey sidekick named Steve with a thought translator strapped onto his chest gets laughs 80 percent of the time, partly thanks to ""How I Met Your Mother"" friend Neil Patrick Harris.<br/><br/>The story is an important one too, of a wild inventor chasing his dreams, trying to make a difference so that people will love him and dealing with the fame of being a town hero once his machine manages to suck atmospheric moisture and cause it to rain any food imaginable. But also, as we see early but the kiddies will learn later, he's really out to earn the approval of his sardine-grinding father (James Caan) who we tell cares but can't say it in any way other than elaborate fishing metaphors. Then there's that being true to who you are stuff, represented by Sam's shame at growing up a meteorology dork with glasses and a scrunchy.<br/><br/>Like every kids film, the shenanigans have a wear-down point, but ""Meatballs"" is layered with subtle jokes kids won't catch (but that aren't inappropriate either -- a real surprise) that teenagers and adults will really appreciate. In terms of humor, the writing compares favorably with the ""Up"" script from earlier in 2009 though certainly as a story ""Meatballs"" is much more cartoon-traditional.<br/><br/>~Steven C<br/><br/>Visit my site http://moviemusereviews.com"

","Love the whole wild, weird imagination of having fast food falling out of the sky, that would solve the half the world's problems. But then it is still an imagination. Simply, the the story of Cloudy with a chance of meatballs is a scientist solves world's hunger problem, and the food starts falling from the sky, only to realise that things are not going as planned.<br/><br/>It is a very well written movie, well done animation, even thought it would have been Pixar's idea at first, but then it isn't. Love the characters, all big eyed, there are some with no eyes, but then only at the time of surprise their eyes would be popping out. Love the father-son relationship, it is not saying I told you so. Even enjoyed the sarcasm towards consuming fast food as to how it would lead to health problems. So, there is nothing called fast food.<br/><br/>Love the way, the wild scientist works towards developing new inventions and his style of approach to an experiment as well as to a relationship is similar. A step-by-step approach."
"Mark_Sabanathan","10","2","3","5 November 2009"," Highly original and fun animation
","This has to be one of the most original and fun movies that I have seen in a long time.<br/><br/>The film is in 2D and 3D. I saw it in 2D, as my friend is not keen on 3D. This film is still excellent and engrossing in 2D. I am sure it will be even more awesome in 3D.<br/><br/>There are some underlying messages in the film about over indulgence and social responsibility, but it does not feel like you are being preached to.<br/><br/>The movie will appeal to adults and children alike. Unlike some other films that appeal to all ages, this is not because it has innuendo that kids won't get, but because it is a great and enjoyable film.<br/><br/>The animation is not up to Pixar's standard, but this does not affect the film at all. It is unique and original and does not try to imitate anyone else. It left me with a great feeling when I left the cinema.<br/><br/>One of the characters is voiced by an 80's TV cult TV favourite, which I thought was great (you'll know who when you hear them).<br/><br/>All in all, my favourite film of 2009 so far (I would say of 2009 in total, but Avatar is coming soon, so let's see).<br/><br/>I hope you enjoy it as much as I did."

"thesubstream","8","2","3","9 October 2009"," Smart, meaty, funny mayhem.
","In short: Meat falls from the sky. Completely hilarious and 100% awesome through and through. Take your kids to see this, now. Or just go alone on your lunch break....<br/><br/>In a world (ours) where the kids' section of the video store is dominated by movies boasting farting animals, instantly dated pop-culture references and jive-talking stunt-cast celebrities, it's a huge relief to report that there's a legitimately great CG-animated family movie out that isn't even produced by the bar-raisers at Pixar! I was surprised, to be honest, to find myself laughing out loud through most of Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs, while at the same time feeling impatient for it to end so I could call my sister and insist that I take her kids to see it immediately. No rapping penguins, no dependency on toilet humour, and no Robin Williams. The film treats its young audience as the sophisticates they actually are, rather than playing down and dumb, and at the same time permits an entrée to the best kind of rainbow-coloured imaginative, anarchic fantasy land, one where it snows ice-cream and a giant pancake with two pats of butter and a flood of maple syrup can destroy an elementary school.<br/><br/>Written and directed by Phil Lord and Chris Miller (the guys behind the underrated, short-lived Clone High 2D animated series), CWaCoM is a loose adaptation of the kids' story of the same name. Having not read the book (I read grown-up books for I am a grown up. I see children's' movies because that is my prerogative, thank you very much), I can't really comment on the adaptation (apparently they changed a bunch of stuff), but as a film on its own, it's fantastic. It's genuinely hilarious, absolutely ridiculous, really, really smart and bursting with energy.<br/><br/>Despite a bit of a lag in the middle and the tedious doling-out of some slightly over-wrought life-lessons, this movie has one of the best-written scripts for an animated family comedy that I've come across. The humour is as high-brow as it is screw-ball, and never betrays the tone of the story or its lovably crafted characters. And as out-there as the story is, the film is smart and self-aware enough to poke fun at itself (and other more serious sci-fi/disaster films tropes) whenever possible, but never as an exclusive wink to the grown-ups rather, the film assumes that everybody, young and old, has seen enough cheesy sci-fi/disaster movies and can recognize the clichés . For example, while showing footage of food destroying the Eiffel tower and the Great Wall of China, a news anchor comments on how the food storm seems to be attacking famous monuments first before heading off to more boring parts of the world. It's a joke that any adult that's seen a Dean Devlin film would surely get, but it's not that out there to assume that kids would understand why that's funny as well.<br/><br/>The character design is fairly average nothing you haven't seen before. You can tell Lord and Miller did their best to bring their signature angular, hand-drawn style to the CG realm, but obviously they had to cut corners (literally) in order to make their usual expressive, borderline-cubist character designs come to life. Any sharp facial features are rounded and smoothed over, and any would-be interesting character profile is made less so in order to allow the necessary camera movements of CG animation to demonstrate just how fleshed out this CG environment really is. It's too bad they couldn't have pushed the design a bit further to come up with something as stylistically unique as their past work, but still, nobody in the film had any nostrils which was nice to see. (Editor's Note: What the hell, Rajo) And there's nothing bad I can say about the animation. While I've seen more impressive stuff done by Pixar, watching the giant food rain down in 3D was an absolute blast, and as usual, the Real-D technology did not disappoint.<br/><br/>It was the kind of movie you walk out of and think, ""Wow, I just saw a great movie!"" The voice actors weren't annoying (Mr. T did not ONCE say ""I pity the fool""), the story was funny and charming and I just can't get over how awesome it was to see a giant jello-mould bouncy castle... I haven't had Jello in ages! I can't wait to see it again. Really. 8.2/10"
"jamiemiles6","8","2","3","7 October 2009"," A Lesson in creativity
","In all honesty I wasn't expecting much when going to see this movie. My lack of anticipation was most probably due to the movies trailer and how storyless it presented this movie as being. I was perhaps expecting something along the lines of 'Bee movie' with a messy plot and a directionless outcome. Needless to say I was pleasantly surprised.<br/><br/>The inventiveness of this movie was what won me over. Countless times I was amazed by the sheer novelty of ideas and their perfect execution. Additionally, once you've adjusted to the protagonists voice (which I initially perceived as being a bit miscast), the characters were mostly endearing creating a strongly fuelled interest in the outcome of the film. <br/><br/>'Meatball's' structure also deserves a mention. In general, animated movies seem to follow the tried and tested 'Hero vs villain' model which to any film veteran fast becomes tiresome. The development of this film's plot took a somewhat different approach and was considerably uniquely structured and paced very well. The lack of story in the trailer is guessedly due to the desire of the producers to keep the plot developments as unanticipated turns (and rightly so). <br/><br/>Many many times throughout I found myself laughing loudly in unison with the rest of the audience who seemed to be having as much fun as the crowd I was with. Most of the jokes worked and the repeating comedy themes (the hilarious 'rat-birds' to name one) never failed to bring out a fit of laughter. <br/><br/>My only complaint is that at some points there was perhaps an excess of originality creating the feeling that they were trying to cram as many ideas into the space of an hour and a half as conceivably possible. I sporadically found myself overwhelmed and desiring some filler scenes to give the movie more of a flow. <br/><br/>Well, if the trailer hasn't won you over and you're deliberating as to whether or not you think you'll enjoy, take my advice, forget the trailer and go and watch the most inventive and hysterical movie you'll see in quite some time..."

","As many of you reading my comments can attest, I love animation. So with that said, you probably won't be surprised when I say I loved Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs! What a wonderful premise of having a town called Swallow Falls, which mostly has been left behind with just sardines as food for the townspeople, and having the inventor who previously was mocked invent something that provides alternative food choices at a drop from the sky. Good voice is provided by such ""SNL"" cast members as Andy Samberg, Will Forte, and as the inventor, Bill Hader. Anna Faris voices the weatherperson who follows the town's progress. And, in a wonderful surprise, Mr. T is the policeman whose son gets a special gift from Hader's scientist. Also cast are Neil Patrick Harris, Benjamin Bratt, and as Hader's father, James Caan. Gags flow smoothly from sequence to sequence with no distracting pop culture references, like that of the last Shrek movie. While hilarious, it's also touching near the end. Oh, and it's always a treat when the Columbia Torch Lady gets a humorous treatment at the beginning..."
"PipAndSqueak","5","8","21","17 October 2009"," Yawn
","The animation for this film is really very well done. The characters have a certain amount of reality about them. The story is just plain ridiculous. Fine, and this should be the basis of a good kids film. This isn't, oddly enough. I was bored very quickly, and the young audience I was sharing the film with were equally unenthralled. Several kids continued to play up throughout the presentation - a rather telling symptom of disinterest. This contrasted very sharply with the audience for UP who were very attentive as soon as the action started. I suspect the problem with Cloudy is the adult, relationship based story. Ideal for girls and Guardian reading adults. I wouldn't recommend this film and don't want to see it again, unlike much superior animations like Shrek, Up etc ."

Pancakes, hotdogs, meatballs, cheeses, donuts and spaghetti. I feel like even only these scripts make my blood thick. So those images were tougher for me!
If I would exchange them to Japanese food, they might be chased by large rice balls, enjoy the pools made by soy soups, a castle of rice dumplings in a sweet sauce.

However I'm glad I gave this one a shot.<br/><br/>Cloudy with a chance of meatballs has it all. A likable protagonist, an easy straight forward story, an occasionally creepy vibe when the food comes alive (those deep fried chickens crawling down from the ceiling like the orcs from The Felowship of the Ring, were pretty creepy). But what really got to me, was the relationship between the hero Flint and his blue- collar father Tim really pulled at the heart strings. <br/><br/>It was beautifully crafted and had a good heart. <br/><br/>Check it out."
"Tweekums","8","1","1","23 October 2013"," A fun and surreal animation
","From an early age Flint Lockwood has been a keen inventor; unfortunately his inventions haven't proved too useful. He lives in the town of Swallow Falls on a remote Atlantic island and when the world stops buying their sardines; living the locals with nothing else to eat he decides to provide an alternative. He makes a machine that can convert water into any type of food. An accident on the day he tests his machine launches it into the clouds and soon it starts raining hamburgers. That isn't all it can make though; he just has to upload the structure of a food and it will rain from the skies. Soon, thanks to visiting TV weather presenter Sam Sparks the world learns what is happening and the town's mayor sees an opportunity. Inevitably there is a problem though; the food starts to mutate and become bigger and bigger and the town is endangered. If it is to be saved Flint and his new friend Sam will have to find a way to shut the machine off.<br/><br/>This animated film was a lot of fun; the premise is delightfully surreal and there are plenty of laughs to be had. Flint is a good protagonist and Sam is fine as the romantic interest; it made a nice change for the leading lady to put on glasses and tie her hair back rather than take them off to become attractive. The character designs are good and fairly distinctive and the voice cast did a good job bringing them to life. The strange weather effects are well designed; I particularly liked the spaghetti tornado. If there is a slight flaw it is that the final effort to turn off the machine seemed to drag on a bit and while most children will probably enjoy it some may be a little disturbed at one point somebody is swallowed by a plucked, headless chicken! Overall I'd recommend this to fans of modern animation; whatever their age."
"theinaniloquent","8","1","1","17 November 2011"," ""Prepare to get served""
","The most delicious event since macaroni met cheese. Inspired by the beloved children's book, the film focuses on a town where food falls from the sky like rain.<br/><br/>I saw this film by accident... Standing in line, highly expecting to see a new action-thriller, the tickets ran out. I was mad, especially how I drove an hour up the road to the theater. The only thought in my head was how I wasted my time, and how bad I wanted to see the movie. So instead of staying with the grudge, I went to see this. Animations are hated, due to their kid-like nature, but I'm surprisingly a fan. Pixar hits me the most, and most likely will be the only animation I'll love, but Dreamworks has some memorable stuff too, so I had SOME expectations. I sat down, expecting a clichéd and fun movie, and came out BLOWN AWAY! The animation has improved since Dreamwork's beginning. They have some good stuff, but their animation has died down since Shrek. But this movie is most possibly one of the best animations with witty antics, stunning animation, and an intelligent plot. The movie, for one, is based off a book. It was a short book, but instead of keeping with the book, they went all out and created an altered universe of the story. The story is great; who wouldn't love food falling from the sky? The only thing I would suspect is bad reviews because of it's child-like ways of presenting things. I believe some people forget that this movie is actually labeled as a KID'S FILM and get a bit carried away. Nevertheless, if you avoid the kid's presentations and their ways of doing some stuff, you'll be fine. I saw this film 3D... The animation is absolutely brilliant, comparing with Pixar's Walle. The characters look amazingly real and you can actually read their lips; a recent discovery in technology. The voice acting was great, unexpectedly, and I was overall shocked of how much I liked it. If you like animations, see it. If you don't, of course I would suggest not. It's a love it or hate it film, but I surely loved it. 8/10."

","This animation is enjoyable from beginning to end. The protagonist, Flint, is an adorable mad scientist! While in his lab, he reminded me so much of Doctor Who and I think this character shares a lot with Doctor Who. The experience of watching this film is really something out of this world. I felt a part of that little town and found so many of the townspeople and children to be such a significant part of the film. The relationship between father and son, Earl and Cal, is endearing. The relationship that develops between Flint and weather gal, Sam Sparks, is adorable and portrayed quite tastefully. Even as an adult, I find Cloudy to be entertaining and quite magical. It awakens the child within I think. This is great to watch as a family. I was also surprised at how I was able to not recognize any ""big voices"" in this film- there was not a moment I went ""oh, that's so-and-so's voice!"" Famous actors didn't get in the way of the film, in other words. I would watch Cloudy again in a heartbeat."
"johnstrash1","9","1","1","19 May 2011"," We could live underground, and use bacon for clothes.
","In 2009, two of the best cartoons ever made were released. One is Up, the other is Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs. This movie was just amazing.<br/><br/>Animation - I have never seen a cartoon so detailed, even in a Pixar film. Sony went all out to create a level of quality that has to be watched more than once to appreciate. From the reflection in characters eyes, to the movement of their hair and clothing to the simulation of falling food, the production team spared no effort to make everything as realistic as possible. And if you mute the sound, you can actually read lips when someone is talking.<br/><br/>Voice Acting - A superb performance was given by every actor, especially Bill Hader. Although most cartoons have gotten really good at this, it is still worth mentioning here.<br/><br/>Humor - This is without a doubt the funniest animated film I have ever seen. A lot of slapstick coupled with hilarious lines and comical facial expressions. Again, more than one viewing will reveal something that you may have missed the first time around.<br/><br/>Story - A lot of people were disappointed that the story was so far off from the book. And although I respect that point of view, it shouldn't distract from what is a great story in it's own right. It had some good messages, such as the effects of over indulgence, being who you are despite your appearance and keeping your goals in life simple. And it does it without coming across the least bit preachy.<br/><br/>But as no movie is perfect, so it is the same with Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs. I think it could of done with a little less of the Baby Brent character and the end wasn't quite as funny as the rest of the movie. But maybe the biggest disappointment was the use of mild foul language. I am not sure why they had to include the phrase ""Holy crap balls"" or even ""hell hole"" when making a movie that has kids as it's target audience. It cheapens the movie a little for lines that could have easily been omitted.<br/><br/>Regardless of it's minor drawbacks, I still highly recommend seeing this movie. And then seeing it again."

However, he has the support of his mother but when she dies, he's left alone with his father (James Cann) who thinks he should give it up (agree). When the community that he lives in, is in an economic crisis because their primary source of income a sardine cannery was shut down, Flint decides to try his latest invention, a machine that can turn water into food. But something goes wrong and the machine ends up in the atmosphere. Later it starts raining food like hamburgers, pizza, hot dogs, etc... And so the shifty mayor tries to use this as a way to help their community. But when Flint sense something's wrong with the machine, the mayor convinces him to ignore it. But as Flint predict chaos ensues. So not to ruin the story, something bad happened.<br/><br/>It is funny and gut-wrenching, but at the same time it is hopeful with Flint's dreams almost coming true.

"oneguyrambling","8","1","1","8 November 2010"," Flint Lockwood is NOT a cowboy - just a kid in a cool food-rain film.
","Flint Lockwood is not a cowboy - I repeat NOT a cowboy - even if his name practically demands it. He is actually a young kid inventor (at the start of the film), whose curiosity and idealism leads him to endure public ridicule, as early inventions are a little less than earth shattering. His Mum and Dad stick by him all the same and provide support for his aspirations, even if they don't fully understand them.<br/><br/>Flint is a citizen of Swallow Falls, a small seaside town famous for its sardine industry, though in recent years the area is slumping as sardines are a little less popular, anyone who has sat in a lunchroom when someone cooks then can attest why.<br/><br/>They stink.<br/><br/>Fast forward to young adulthood, and the 18ish Flint has continued inventing, with his biggest sorta success being a talking monkey named Steve, and apparently a new invention that converts ordinary water into food. Don't ask how, it's a movie.<br/><br/>Other things at home aren't so rosy, Mum has passed on, Dad isn't too happy and on top of that the continued decline in sardine PR has meant his sardine shop is running on fumes.<br/><br/>The mayor of Swallow Falls hatches a scheme to bring the town back, he changes tack and decides to set up ""Sardineland"" and market Swallow Falls as a tourist destination. Now before you get online to buy your tix to Sardineland I must assure you it is made up and doesn't exist.<br/><br/>As expected Sardineland blows, and Flint skips the unveiling to continue work on his water/food converter, and as this is a movie things go haywire and the converter is inadvertently sent into the atmosphere, ruining the grand opening of Sardineland in the process and drawing the ire of the Mayor and the locals, including Dad.<br/><br/>Now the poster, previews and even the title tells us to expect culinary precipitation, and golly-bob-howdy if that isn't exactly what we get. After Flint learns to control his invention people actually start putting in advance orders for birthdays, anniversaries etc.<br/><br/>Initially the townspeople are exceedingly grateful, because as well as having something unfishy to eat they are also immediately put on the map and draw in crowds of visitors. Down the track however things go awry, and Flint and his new pals must step in to save the day.<br/><br/>What makes CWACOM a success is the characters, although some, if not most of the characters are voiced by actors it doesn't distract from the action, also, more than anything the creators were smart enough to put in actual jokes to keep you amused. I laughed often through the movie, and while I haven't put this to the test yet I think this will be a movie with high re-watchability.<br/><br/>Back to the characters, Flint (voiced by Bill Hader) is actually quite low key and likable, as is the love interest Sam, an intern weather channel reporter who stumbles upon a career-making story from the sky. Their fledgling relationship comes along slowly and believably, as they realize they have far more in common than they thought.<br/><br/>As always it is the bit-parts in animated movies that are given the longest leashes, the Mayor is a bit of the bad guy stereotype, but he does get some of the best lines, and his overindulgence once the chubby-rain begins leads to some sight gags. An advertising kid, formerly named Baby Brent but now grown up and more than a little pathetic is also welcome, but the show stealer is Mr T, in his best (only?) role since Rocky III, as an overzealous cop hellbent on preserving law and order and looking after his young son.<br/><br/>The rain effects are amazing and awesome looking, especially a spaghetti-twister and a food-o-lanche later in proceedings. Apparently food related natural disasters lend themselves to an animated setting with the vibrant colour and movement. The second half of the film moves at breakneck speed but the pace never goes too fast that the story is hard to follow, there are a few jokes that will fly over say a 6 year old's head, but enough other stuff to keep everyone from 5 through 13 amused.<br/><br/>The ending is also gloriously over the top and insane, who can say ""no thanks"" to scenes with mutated angry, protective food? There could have been a few more ""fat American"" jokes aside from the mayor, but perhaps the creators feared the inevitable backlash that honest commentary often brings. (As an Australian I can't distance our culture from the US too much either, though on my one trip to the US earlier this decade, myself and my wife had a ""fat person"" of the day photo, which turned into an eye-opening collection once we arrived home. Can't say I ever felt impelled to do that here.) CWACOM has some great set-pieces and action, some snappy dialogue and amusing sight-gags, it also effectively straddles the line without being too kiddy nor too adult-oriented. I recommend this for anyone who watched Horton Hears a Who and liked it, but this is definitely funnier.<br/><br/>Final Rating – 8 / 10. I may be wrong but I don't think I have enjoyed a kid's movie this much since Monster House, (Up and Wall-E are better, Monster House more enjoyable). This is a kid's movie that justifies a trip to the cinema.<br/><br/>If you liked this review (or even if you didn't) check out oneguyrambling.com"
"dudedazzreviews","8","1","1","7 October 2010"," One of the best animated movies I have ever seen!
","Recently, I had yet to see a children's animated movie that wasn't by Disney or DreamWorks that was just a pure joy to watch since Spirited Away and I'm very happy to say that Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs is one of the greatest animated children's movies I have ever seen. Based on a children's book, Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs is about a young inventor called Flint who has invented a brilliant machine that turns water into food and Sam Sparks, a weathergirl with a secret. As Flint tries his new invention, the machine goes horribly wrong and starts to manipulate the weather. Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs is very colourful and beautifully animated from start to finish with everything very detailed and looking visually gorgeous and mouth-watering, I can imagine how good this would look in 3D. The animation isn't exactly Disney Pixar quality but it could rival DreamWorks very easily. The story is very imaginative and original and it reminds you of children's movies you watched back in the eighties and nineties with some great comical slapstick thrown in for good measure. Also added to the story is humour thanks to the messages the story provides, the style of the animation and the quirky and lovable characters. The main thing about an animation that can either make you love it more or not is the casting. I feel that a voice actor must have the perfect voice that matches the character in the movie otherwise it can be rather distracting from the movie. Fortunately, Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs not only has a brilliant cast but all of their voices matches the characters perfectly.<br/><br/>Some of the cast include Anna Faris, James Caan, Bruce Campbell, Mr. T and Neil Patrick Harris and all do a magnificent job in lending their voices to their characters. The writing is quite smart as, even though this is a children's animated movie, it's so much more than that. In the imaginative, bright story lies a subtle message about confidence and parental guidance and surely enough, the audience will see that message shine through in the movie. Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs is something that is not only original but absolutely funny as well and very memorable. I have never heard of the book before (in fact, I didn't even know it was a book until I saw the credits at the end of the movie) but if you want to see a children's movie that makes you laugh as well as charms you, then look no further than Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs.<br/><br/>The movie is something that both adults and children will enjoy and is a prime example of what is a perfect family movie. With the voices adding to the characters and the brilliantly colourful animation, Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs is something that you will not forget in a hurry. The movie may not be the same quality as Disney or Pixar but it's close enough so well done to Sony. The only regret I have about this movie is that I did not go to see it in 3D because I could imagine it being fantastic, however the movie itself is brilliant.

","Preferring 2D animation, I did not have high hopes for this film. So many rely on big names, adult humour & cruel parody. Also, apart from the Ice Age trilogy, the visuals aren't usually cute. But I was pleasantly surprised by this sweet & funny effort. Flint is a sympathetic lead. His enthusiasm leads to trouble for the whole town, but backed by some loyal & eccentric companions, he is determined to set things right. Bruce Campbell enjoys his role as the mayor, as does Mr T as the police chief. Steve the monkey has scene stealing moments too. Visual and spoken jokes work well. There is the standard father-son relationship, but this is resolved in a new way. The junk food message is given without hammering. A fun adventure for the whole family. 8/10"

","All right, so let's take the weirdest and craziest characters that we can think of, the most improbable story that could happen to them, let's throw in dozens of funny puns, and there you have it : Cloudy with a chance of meatballs, one of the funniest animated movie I've ever seen.<br/><br/>This is one of those movies that really makes an hour look like twenty minutes, it's very well written and voiced, but also, the animation is great, really fluid and colorful.<br/><br/>I have to say I went to this film thinking it was going to be terrible, I couldn't stand the idea of ""ok, let's make stupid stuff happen and kids will be pleased"", but this is nothing like that, here everything is either funny, or tries and succeed at being emotional.<br/><br/>Now, the only downside to this movie, I'd say, is the fact that after the first 40 minutes, it probably won't surprise you plotwise, and all you do is enjoying the fun (which is excellent in itself).<br/><br/>The movie leaves you with an excellent feeling and surely, good memories."

","This is an excellent movie for parents to enjoy with their children While it has a cute, imaginative story for the kids, and even a romance for tweens, it also has stunning graphics that (despite what another reviewer said) outshine anything Pixar has done This movie has ""throw away"" scenes that would be the main feature of other films, of special note being the aquarium of water in the beginning, contrasting fluidity of water, translucency of glass and water but distinct from each other, moving with realistic physics And, as a ""cherry on top"", the dialogue is witty and laugh out loud funny (And don't pay attention to reviewers who saw porn that is only in their minds where there was none )<br/><br/>The only negative notes I saw was a moment of mourning, which might momentarily upset very young children, and a gag were they use the monkey translator to have the father speak to the son, which I took to be disrespectful of parents <br/><br/>Other than those two brief moments (which can be explained by parents) it is an outstanding movie that will entertain anyone of any age"

","Failure after failure after failure after failure, Flint decides to solve a certain sardine problem his town has, by converting water into food. He invents a machine, which then goes a bit haywire and launches itself into the sky. Fortunately for him, it worked, and food begins falling out of the sky. Unfortunately it eventually gets a mind of it's own and tries to destroy to town with over-sized food. <br/><br/>Look at the pretty colours. Those were the words from my girlfriend when we saw the trailer for this film, which we sadly did not see in the theatres. Yes, Cloudy With A Chance Of Meatballs is a great animated kids film with more than enough comedy for the older crowd. Although it wasn't the best animated film last year, it was the funniest in my opinion. <br/><br/>The animation fit the story perfectly and the food falling all over were great visuals. You can tell the animators had a lot of fun with this film. Sony Pictures Animation haven't really had a film in their roster to stand out and to me, this one is their golden ticket. It's a shame it wasn't recognized at the Oscars, as I think it deserved a place on the nomination list. <br/><br/>The kids learn valuable lessons about responsibility and being yourself, while getting to have fun with the images of ice cream snowball fights, a building made out of jello and a school covered by a giant pancake. The adults get the comedy of Bill Hader from SNL, recognizable voices of Mr. T, Neil Patrick Harris and the man, the myth, the legend himself, Bruce Campbell. Each role fit their voice actor perfectly. Usually Anna Faris annoys me, here she made me like her character more because of her unique voice. James Caan as the dad is the added cherry on the top of the cake. Gummi Bear Twilight Zone reference? Brilliant.<br/><br/>The film is really funny and hits every note it has to. The climax works perfectly and the vibrant colours will keep the kids watching the screen. The disaster film has been given the animated kids film treatment and it works wonderfully. I highly recommend Cloudy With A Chance Of Meatballs for the entire family."

","When I saw the advert on TV I thought this would be another lame CGI film that's just for kids. But I was VERY wrong. We rented the film on TV, and I watched it after my dad and sister did. My dad told me it was funny, so I thought what the heck I might as well go and see it. I was totally blown away from the start. The CGI was pretty incredible, a lot of the details looked very realistic, and I got a few laughs in the first 5 minutes of the film. As the film rolled on it got funnier, and in the end my sides hurt from laughing! The set of characters were very well done, and they captured a perfect personality for each character.

","I was not sure what to expect going in to this movie, but found it to be delightfully funny and particularly refreshing, given the current state of non-Pixar animated films. While the plot is fairly simple at first glance, the story of would-be inventor Flint Lockwood and his quest to create a food generating machine contains some surprisingly deep messages and social commentary. His machine eventually goes out of control, raining food of gargantuan proportions down from the heavens onto the tiny Atlantic island nation of Swallow Falls and even the rest of the world. Meanwhile, weathergirl Sam Sparks is sent to Swallow Falls to investigate the culinary curiosity, and Lockwood must eventually find a way from saving the world from certain doom at the hands of his seemingly magical creation. The voice acting is top notch, and includes some outstanding work by talented individuals such as James Caan, Bruce Campbell, and even Mr. T himself. The movie does not take itself too seriously, but also takes care not to fall into the trap of pop-culture parody or crude scatological humor. An excellent movie all around."

","If you are a weather girl, your biggest break would be to deliver a forecast citing 'Cloudy with a chance of Meatballs... with spaghetti on the side'.<br/><br/>Who knew whether or not I would like this film at all. It could have swung both ways. After all we have seen the typical hero complex storyline and the falling slowly in love theme, but oddly enough this was surely a different way to tell a story, especially for the younger generation.<br/><br/>'Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs' had a slight twist to it which resembled a slight brilliance tangled in the storyline. A forlorn scientist who finally gets his big break only to be used and abused to the point where world domination comes to play and of course there must be a love interest poked somewhere in between the mayhem.<br/><br/>This movie stroke out all other new coming movies to the top and there were the occasional echoes of anchor showcased upon the closing act and overall good feedback, so I knew I had to give my view on this show's excitement in ratings.<br/><br/>To set my enjoyment aside for this one, I would tell you that you've probably seen this one already, if not something like it, but you would have a good laugh and there's no doubt the writers found a way to give it a new spin so much that it would not disappoint.

","Cloudy with a chance of meatballs is a comedy. There is no denying it. No animation that is not Pixar(besides the original Shrek)will ever get a ten. Because most of the time, they are missing the heart and inspiration that Pixar has. Cloudy with a chance of meatballs is one of those animated films. It's missing the heart and there isn't much inspiration put into the film. <br/><br/>This is not a Pixar. So it's a given that I won't like it as much. This is the story of a scientist named Flint(voiced by the always likable Bill Hader). He is a likable character. The problem with his inventions are that none of them actually work. He also works at his dad's(voiced by James Caan, another likable character) work. His inventions blow until he invents a machine that causes food to rain from the sky.<br/><br/>Flint meets a newscaster(voiced by Anna Farris) who he soon falls for. Most of the characters are funny. And the film is funny at times. And the movie keeps your attention for the most part. But in the last half hour, the film gets awfully stupid. There is a scene in which Flint, Sam, the newscaster, and a retarded Sardine's representative(voiced by Andy Samburg, the most irritating character in the film)are going into a huge ball of food. Eventually, pizza slices try to blow them up. And once they get in the cave, these creepy looking turkeys come alive and try to kill them. That is how stupid the movie is.<br/><br/>I am sad to say this, but this is the most ridiculous movie of the year. They say it's based on the book. Yeah right. I preferred the book. At least it didn't distract us with visuals and laughs to keep us entertained. Is this as bad as Ice age 3? Certainly not. But if they added a few more ingredients and delete the stupidity, then you might have enjoyed being crushed by giant meatballs. Oh yeah, this is a movie. What am I saying?<br/><br/>Cloudy with a chance of meatballs: C+"
"throwaway172","8","3","6","25 September 2009"," A fascinating story and probably the funniest animated movie I've ever seen . . .
","Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs: a fun movie, even the second time around.<br/><br/>This film created one of those rare instances when, during the closing credits, I thought to myself ""Wow, I really enjoyed that movie"". At a first glance that was entirely based on the trailer, it seemed like one of those movies where I wasn't convinced that the story would be strong enough to last the entire film. Even after viewing the first 5 minutes, I was still a little uneasy about how the rest of the film would entertain. I shouldn't have been. After the next 10 minutes, I was deeply into the characters and the plot, and I remained this way until the end.<br/><br/>The animation suited the movie very well. Each character was so distinctively different from the other and the voice acting was phenomenal. It was humorous throughout with a lot of original comedy but it didn't overdue it to the degree of 'slapstick'. It provided a good amount of laughter for both the young children and the older, more mature ones in the audience. It's story was both funny and serious at the same time...'a perfect combination'.<br/><br/>You really have to see this movie for yourself to appreciate it. You have to be willing to give it a chance and NOT subconsciously assume that it is ""just another movie for kids"". Those people who aren't willing to do that will probably not enjoy this movie to its full and will miss the big picture...which is really a shame.<br/><br/>So go ahead and give this movie a watching if you think it's your type of film. I did, and consequently gave it two!...you gotta love the theatre<br/><br/>Jimmy,"
"neil-476","9","3","6","23 September 2009"," A visual delight, with real heart
","I really enjoyed this movie. It is based on a well-loved book, I am told, but as I've never heard of it, I'm just going on the movie.<br/><br/>The story is simple but daft. Flint Lockwood lives on a small island which has fallen on hard times since the decimation of the sardine fishing industry. Flint is a brilliant but not very successful amateur scientist whose inventions cause trouble and embarrass Flint's father no end (Dad, who talks exclusively in fishing metaphors, simply wants Flint to join him in the family fishing tackle shop). Novice TV reporter Sam Sparks is sent to report on the opening of Sardine World, and her arrival coincides with an accident in which Flint destroys Sardine World but finally achieves success with an invention which turns water into food. Then things get complicated...<br/><br/>The story develops nicely and steadily, with no dead patches. Both Flint and Sam are likable and vulnerable, and the romance between them is believable and pleasing. There are lots of gags, both verbal and visual, including some which payoff much later in the movie from quite small seeds planted earlier. The 3D is excellent, with some sequences quite stunning. And the film bursts with visual imagination - I can't remember a movie which displayed this much imagination for a long time.<br/><br/>But most of all, the heart of this movie (to me, at any rate), is the dysfunctional relationship between Flint and his Dad, and the heartwarming resolution of this is one of the most satisfying parts of the movie's conclusion.<br/><br/>There is a lot in this film for both adults and children, and I recommend it."
"Kinetek","8","3","6","22 September 2009"," A Bowlful Of 3D Fun!
","Computer-generated animation flicks are six to the penny these days - some good, some bad, and some downright ugly - but I'm pleased to say that Cloudy With A Chance Of Meatballs really does hit the spot.<br/><br/>So - Sony unveil their all-singing, all-dancing, 'powerful enough to rival the mighty Pixar' animation kit - but the question is... is it?<br/><br/>On this evidence, the answer is... perhaps. Bear in mind there are TWO versions of this film - namely 2D and 3D. I, perhaps like yourself, had read and watched frankly average reviews based on the 2D version, as many theatres will not be showing the 3D version - and to be perfectly honest, this DOES matter.<br/><br/>As a standalone 2D film, not much stands out from the crowd here - the animation is good, perhaps as good as Pixar in parts, but that isn't enough to warrant whooping and cheering from the aisles. The story itself is a little thin, the voice overs do enough to make it work - but again, nothing to write home about. BUT...<br/><br/>...Don those 3D glasses, take a seat (preferably one of those expensive leather ones at the back) and prepare to be truly DAZZLED. What looks ordinary and laboured at times in 2D transforms into something straight out of a bag of multi-coloured candy, kaleidoscopic and fresh. I don't think I've ever seen so much depth and colour on the big screen ever. At times the film is truly jaw-dropping - talk about shock and awe.<br/><br/>OK, So what's the deal? Sony showcase their new kit, but neglect the plot and acting talent in order to show off it's real jewel in the crown, namely the 3D capacity? You got it.<br/><br/>It's been attempted on many occasions, and has rarely worked - Pixar themselves enjoyed a little fame with the 10 minute Shrek short - albeit in anaglyph format - but apart from a few moments, it looked as if they were trying too hard. Cloudy With A Chance Of Meatballs has taken the 3D guideline book, ripped it up and thrown it out of the building - looking silly in a pair of geeky 3D specs will never be the same again.<br/><br/>And it seems Pixar, THE genuine animation article for what seems like time out of mind now, have decided to run with the ball too. A genuine 'anything you can do' battle seems inevitable with the re-release of Toy Story in 3D imminent. Can they pull it off? Only time will tell.<br/><br/>Back to Sony. While the animation hardware looks more than capable of giving Pixar a run for it's money in years to come - it's not quite there yet. But forget all that, if you have kids, you are a kid or you're a kid in an adult's body that secretly wished 3D would finally get the chance to grow up - your dreams, all of them, have been fulfilled.<br/><br/>Fantastic, spellbinding stuff - look for a theatre that is showing the 3D version, and get there today!"
"CrazyJustin1785","10","3","6","21 September 2009"," A very filling movie!
","Cloudy With A Chance of Meatballs is the story of Flint Lockwood (Bill Hader) an inventor who has yet to invent a successful invention. All this changes when his invention that goes haywire at a big event in the island town of Chew and Swallow causes it to rain any kind of food that a person could think of. This also brings weather girl Sam Sparks (Anna Farris) to Chew and Swallow to cover the raining food. We also are treated to great voice performances from the following people: James Caan as the father and voice reason to Flint, Mr. T as the town's only policeman and Bruce Campbell in an hilarious role as the town's mayor. As the food begins to fall the story becomes a tiny bit predictable but the writing is brilliant with lots of bits that tie up nicely by the end of the film and the ending I related to somewhat and nearly had a tear in my eye because of it.<br/><br/>Animation wise Cloudy is amazing and I really think it'll help in giving it a shot to ""Upset"" ""Up!"" this year at the academy awards. I've read in a couple other reviews that the 3D version of Cloudy is even more amazing animation wise so if you have a theater with 3D projection defiantly check out Cloudy in 3D.<br/><br/>All in all I have to say I enjoyed Cloudy a lot and while I didn't give it a full 10 out of 10 or 4 out of 4 stars on IMDb.Com and FlimCrave.com I still think that it has a really good chance to upset Pixar's run of Academy Awards for best animated film based mainly on two simple facts: Great story with lots of brilliantly written bits and amazing animation that I look forward to watching on Blu-Ray when it's released. Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs a very filling movie appetite wise."

","When I was little, my mother used to read to me before bed. Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs was one of our favorites. So when we heard it was being made into a movie, we absolutely had to go. I will admit to being hesitant - it was such a short book, and more pictures than words. I found myself without the slightest idea what to expect. We walked into the theatre in a state of moderate trepidation.<br/><br/>We couldn't have been more wrong. This was one of the best movies I've seen in a while. It had elements from the book that stimulated our memories, and plenty of new and exciting moments to keep us guessing. I can't say for sure, as both of us had read the book many times, but I believe this would be a fun movie whether you've read it or not. Probably 85~90% of the content was fabricated for the movie. I say this in the nicest way possible. I really enjoyed that they were able to flesh out such a short, basic story into something so full and satisfying, while managing to keep true to the spirit of the original work. Brilliant."
"ccthemovieman-1","5","4","10","14 January 2010"," Great Premise, First 50 Minutes......And Then
","I really enjoyed the first 50 minutes of this film but the last 30-some are so silly and overdone that it dampened my enthusiasm for the movie. I wouldn't watch it again, especially not with all the other much-better animated films in recent years.<br/><br/>What happens in the end is the problem that occurs in many modern-day action movies: too much. Things get so frenetic here, so loud and crazy that it simply becomes too much. Action can get boring when it's non-stop and over 10 straight minutes of it. Here, it's like the last 30 and by then, you no longer care what happens.....just get the darn movie over.<br/><br/>Too bad, because this had a great premise and a couple of characters you cared about, like ""Flint"" and ""Steve."" A third man character, the weather girl, ""Sam,"" was okay but much like the film: interesting and likable at first, but slowly less so. She didn't really add a lot to the film with the lame romance and PC angle. Speaking of the latter, ""Mr. T.'s,"" cop character ""Earl"" was over-the-top and insulting in its stereotypical PC mode.<br/><br/>Overall, a film which could have super but carried away and wound up just a big, giant mess, just like all the food splattering on the people."
"brunchie","7","4","10","20 September 2009"," As action packed as any more adult action movie
","There seems to be a trend in children's movies to borrow the intense action scenes from ""grown up"" action flicks and animate them. This film keeps up a frenetic pace. This is good for today's under 14 viewers who have been exposed in equal doses to blockbusters like Spiderman, Transformers, X-Men, and even the Die Hard movies as they are to ""cartoons"". The field has grown so that it's not only Pixar as the only game in town.<br/><br/>My daughter wanted to see it because she remembered it as one of her favorite books that my mother read to her. But also, as she said, ""How can you make a feature length movie out a slim little book?"" I'm glad, actually, that I hadn't read the book first. I'm glad I didn't really see the trailers first. I'm glad because then I would have had preconceived notions. I did think, however, that it was going to be a silly movie that appealed to my daughter but was slight torture for me. I was pleasantly surprised that it was entertaining enough for me. What kept it from being rated higher for me were some, ""Ew, gross"" moments and some things I was surprised made it into a children's movie. It wasn't quite non-stop hilarious like ""Over the Hedge"", but I think they did make a true effort to appeal both to the kids and to the adults that would be bringing them.<br/><br/>One thing the Barretts can be thanking this movie for is that, hopefully, their classic book will be flying off the shelves now. I know I went to the bookstore right after the movie to seek out and read the book the movie was based on. What is pleasant is that, surprisingly, a lot of the elements were retained in the movie, even the clever in-jokes that the book had, like the stores' names. Of course, A LOT of elements were added to flesh out the story but there were some elements I wish they would have added in like the followup story in the second book, in which they found a good use for all that food and the fantastical grandfather narrator.<br/><br/>These days, all that matters is that at least one of us enjoys the movie. I hate when we sit through a turkey that neither of us enjoys."
"FordPrefect-42","6","5","14","19 September 2009"," Fun, light, best seen in 3D
","As a film, Cloudy With A Chance of Meatballs is merely 90 minutes of harmless escapism. The animation is simple and most of the jokes are aimed at the 12-and-under crowd. Still, in IMAX 3D it's a fun ride. While most of the jokes are for kids, there are a handful aimed at tickling adults and there are some really silly sight-gags (enhanced by the 3D) anyone will enjoy. While the animation never reaches far, there is one spectacular scene involving a spaghetti-tornado that stand outs, especially in 3D. The thing that surprised me the most about this was the voice acting. Sure you've got known stars such as James Caan, Neil Patrick Harris, Andy Samdberg, Lauren Graham, Will Forte and Bruce Campbell lending their voices, but only Caan and Campbell really have characters with any substantial amount of dialog (I couldn't even tell you who Graham and Forte played). Mr. T, however, has some fine lines and his celebrity is used effectively as a throwaway joke. As for Bill Hader and Anna Faris, I was pleasantly surprised at how well their voices lend to animation. Hader has a nerdy-goofy voice that makes his character sound anywhere between 16 and 30 years old and he can twist it around between completely silly to awkward and sincere in a way that feels natural (for a cartoon at least). Faris, who to me has a more recognizable voice, is able to transcend that crutch that most celebrity-voice-overs have: she is able to make the character own the voice. Her ""Sam Sparks"" character looks and sounds like her own character. I rarely, if ever, had that nagging image in the back of my head of Anna Faris acting this role because her voice lends it self so wonderfully to the film. Faris' comedy relies heavily on her physical performance, and she doesn't hesitate in contorting her face in all manner of outrageous and silly expressions, yet her voice is also a major element in her work. Here, we get that beautiful voice but a character that doesn't act the same way physically. Sam Sparks' physicality is toned-down here, but Faris delivers silly, bizarre and delightfully off-center lines that keep her character unique and enjoyable.<br/><br/>Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs isn't a must-see film by any means. If you do see it, see it in 3D, and enjoy Hader's and particularly Faris' voices."
"DICK STEEL","10","3","7","1 October 2009"," A Nutshell Review: Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs
","Don't watch this on an empty stomach, or in 3D if you're hungry, otherwise you're likely to find yourself reaching out at the screen to want to touch those food products that get constantly rained down from the screen. Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs is extremely delightful, and could give Pixar's Up a run for its money in both the storyline and the visuals department. And given Sony Pictures Animation's not too bloated filmography with memorable offerings such as Monster House, Open Season and Surf's Up, this film proved that their formula is gaining traction, and we should be in for more treats in future.<br/><br/>Bill Hader voices Flint Lockwood, an eccentric inventor who just loves to loudly describe what he's doing in his lab, if he's not talking to his pet monkey Steve who is fitted with a thought- translator. Flint is extremely innovative, but almost always comes up with things that don't work as they were intended to, creating even some of the strangest wildlife for the small fictional Pacific Island with a one-product economy - sardines.<br/><br/>It has a perfect saccharine sweet story about Flint's search for love and acceptance by society, who sees him as nothing more than a nerd whom they can make fun of, especially when his experiments go awry. Add to that, his relationship with his father Tim (James Caan) is breaking down no thanks to the latter's taciturn demeanour, while a rookie weather news reporter Sam Sparks (Anna Faris) happens to be in town to cover an event overshadowed by Flint's contraption, which actually works and sends the entire township into a frenzy with its food on demand, falling from the skies. In no time he becomes Mr Popular at the expense of the town's iconic ""Baby"" Brent (Andy Samberg), and displays the usual syndrome of greed no thanks to a conniving Mayor (Bruce Campbell). There's also some time set aside for a budding romance too.<br/><br/>But what actually worked for the movie, is the strength of the story, packing in plenty in a wildly charged kinetic pace that would simply leave you breathless, and in stitches, all the time. That is no mean feat, especially when the directors Phil Lord and Chris Miller steered very clear of the very tired pop cultural references which animation/comedy tend to trod themselves into. Based on a book by Judi and Ron Barrett, the film has numerous carefully crafted sequences and comedy where the visuals just get chock loaded full of gags, that it requires repeated viewings just to catch them all. Quality of the animation is top notch, while the 3D effects aren't too overwhelming to distract you from the story or characters.<br/><br/>Amongst the subplots, I simply adored and appreciated the father and son story, especially with the episode at its climax because I can clearly relate to it, and I think those who of us who have technologically-phobic parents, would likely be able to identify with that too. That too me was most touching, and somehow emotionally anchored myself to the film, as well as serving as a reminder to lighten up, and be patient.<br/><br/>At the expense of sounding blasphemous, I dare say this film ranks up there with any Pixar offering, as it comes with quality on both the storytelling fronts, as well as the animation, appealing to a wide spectrum of audiences young and old, and especially to the glutton in some of us! The fantastic voice talent lineup provided that extra bit of ingredient to spice up the entire offering, and who can complain when Mr T lends his voice to the town cop Earl Devereaux?<br/><br/>This is definitely a must watch, as it finds itself into my shortlist of films of the year. Do yourself a favour, get a ticket, and be prepared to be served with a charming, entertaining course of comedy, drama, and fun."
"tieman64","Null","2","4","5 October 2010"," Like a less pretentious WALL-E
","""Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs"" is a fun, fast and funny animated comedy which revolves around a young scientist who invents a machine which causes food to rain from the skies. Like Pixar's ""Wall-E"", the film points fingers at Western over-consumption, greed and consumer capitalism, and the effect this lifestyle of decadence has on the environment.<br/><br/>Unlike ""Wall-E"", however, the film is not preachy, its metaphors disguised with wild antics and much mayhem. Consider one scene in which a fat Mayor sails on a giant slice of toast, and then begins to eat the toast until his ""boat"" sinks. It's a metaphor for man irrationally consuming his way to disaster, but it's played for laughs and lasts no more than a couple seconds. The film is filled with such ""visual messages"", but never feels didactic.<br/><br/>This being an animated film, ""Meatballs"" utilises a virtual camera which possesses a sense of freedom and energy which conventional films lack. For this reason, these films are always worth keeping up with.<br/><br/>In terms of flaws, like most of these animated films, the picture is far too busy, never letting any scene or character breathe. Still, the mayhem is in service of something worthwhile. In marrying a tale of ""being yourself"" with ""mega consumption"", this flick, perhaps unintentionally, taps into French philosopher Bernard Stiegler's writings, in which he argues - take a deep breath - that ""the techniques used to create consumer behaviour amount to the destruction of psychic and collective individuation, and that the diversion of libidinal energy toward the consumption of consumer products results in an addictive cycle, leading to hyper-consumption, the exhaustion of desire, and the reign of symbolic misery"". Despite its air of outward juvenility, that's the message this whacky film is trying to convey.<br/><br/>Incidentally, ""Meatballs"" was made by Sony Pictures Animation, late comers into the world of CGI features. Pixar led the way and then came DreamWorks, now Sony is hoping to cash in on this billion dollar global market by using the formulae of both studios. They've only made three films thus far, ""Surf's Up"" and ""Cloudy With A Chance Of Meatballs"" being the best two.<br/><br/>7.9/10 â€“ Environmentalism is in vogue. But is it a coincidence that the Chinese character for ""crisis"" is a combination of the characters for ""danger"" and ""opportunity""? <br/><br/>Worth one viewing."

Children with definitely love it, and adults... well, that actually depends on the adult in question. Although I certainly enjoy all kinds of movies, there's always - for me - some satisfaction to be had when watching something so obviously goofy and kiddo. Meatballs is kiddo, and that's precisely what I loved about it. It may not be this year's best animated movie - that hon our goes to Pixar's Up - but it certainly is better than the likes of Monsters vs. Aliens.<br/><br/>The film tells the story of Flint Lockwood (voice of Bill Hader), a young inventor who dreams of, someday, creating something that will be loved by everyone and make him more popular and, most importantly, improve the lives of everyone in town. Unfortunately, he hasn't been able to do so, and his technophobia father (voice of James Caan) doesn't really help at all. One day, though, he manages to invent something that will change the lives of everyone in town forever: a machine that makes food fall from the sky. Everybody seems to be happy with him now - including mayor Shelbourne (Bruce Campbell) and the by-the-book police offer, Earl (Mr. T) - but, predictably enough, something goes wrong: excess amounts of food start to overload the island where the town is located, and now Flint, along with TV reporter Sam Sparks (Anna Faris) has to try to solve their problem.<br/><br/>Yes, the plot is pretty predictable, and it certainly won't make anyone above the age of 5 be shocked with surprise or anything of the sort, but it certainly is very imaginative, and it should work in a very ""oh, it's sort of nice"" kind of way. I liked the way Flint was portrayed - Hader's wacky and not-so-recognizable voice is perfect for the character - and the fact that, although most characters are either archetypes or stereotypes - consider, for the example, Bruce Campbell's greedy and - eventually - obese mayor - they are all voice so professionally and characterized in such an naive and cute kind of way, that one just doesn't care. I rooted for Flint the whole way, and I actually thought that the romantic sub-plot between him and Sam was cute and funny.<br/><br/>Visually, I don't think the movie is on par to the likes of Wall-E or Up, but I think that comparing it to those productions would be a bit unfair. Wall-E had a sort-of realistic kind of look, and Up, while a little more cartoon's, had a very realistic flair to it. On the other hand, there's something very old-fashioned in Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs' look and the way it is animated. Characters behave and move the way old TV cartoons behaved forty or more years ago, and I like that. They jump a lot, are very ""agile"" and are just... cartoon's. Clearly, the animators didn't want the movie to give a palpable sense of realism; in a way, they were trying to craft an old-fashioned cartoon with the latest technological tools, and they have done it very successfully.<br/><br/>What else can I say about the movie? It certainly is very naive, and it doesn't explore any deep themes or moral problems, but that's just OK. While this year's mediocre Monsters vs. Aliens was terribly simplistic, Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs is just simple, and there's nothing wrong with that. Of course, there's nothing wrong with movies like Wall-E having very significant messages and complex love stories and such, but if a parent wants to go with their toddler to see a movie that isn't very complicated but that isn't stupid or boring either, then Meatballs is an excellent choice. After all, even if there isn't much beneath the surface, I can't imagine a single adult maintaining a straight face throughout the film's running-time. The movie is hilarious, - just remember Flint's father's eyebrows! -, it's inventive, it's imaginative; it's also pretty gorgeous and it features some effective voice acting and interesting, wacky characters. It's not dumb and it doesn't pander to the least common denominator. Most interestingly, though, it made me hungry. That's not a quality many movies posses."

","Sony Pictures Animation and Columbia Pictures present a feature for the whole family. You've heard of a food fight; how about a food storm? Flint Lockwood's inventions have failed his whole young life; one day one of his contraptions was to be the one, a winner. Instead it runs amok and destroys the town square; but wait...his project that finally landed in the clouds appears to be working. His machine starts bombarding the town with cheeseburgers. He can have it rain any and all food requested by the town's happy and hungry citizens. Pizza, hot dogs, pie and ice cream. The machine finally hits ""overload"" and unleashes spaghetti tornadoes and super-sized meatballs.<br/><br/>Terrific animation with fantastic hues. The story line is simple enough to please every viewer. No obligatory 'potty' humor and the soundtrack is on the bright side. A diverse cast lend their voices to give life to the likable and not so appealing characters: Bill Hader, Anna Faris, Bruce Campbell, James Caan, Mr. T., Neil Patrick Harris, Benjamin Bratt, Al Roker and Andy Samberg."

","Best kids movie ever? I think so. I went in thinking it would be good, and came out thinking it was GREAT. I couldn't stop laughing the entire movie! It kind of fits along the lines of, ""It's so crazy, it just might work."" The whole movie is outrageous. The meatball tornado, ice cream snow day, and Jello house make you wish you were in it. It actually made me a little hungry. It also teaches a good moral lesson, in that Flint teaches Sam not to care about her appearance so much, and how she sort of overcomes all that and stops caring. It's a good fun family flick I would gladly go see again. If you saw it in 3D, it was even better. I also liked how Flint reconciles his relationship with his father.

","Sitting. Thinking. Noting. Researching. Motivating. Reviewing! Lettuce take the thyme to digest the cheesy grate-ness that sub-lime-ly makes time fries at an up-beet pace. Tackling two relation-chip dynamics with clumsy scientist Flint Lockwood, an un-raisin-able son wanting to become an inventor and his less than grilled father who wants him to relish in assisting at the family tackle shop, with the other being two friendly loafers whom share the same loaf for celery-brating all things science. Leaving plenty of mushroom for Flint's latest invention, a diatonic super mutating dynamic food replicator, going bananas and dipping the townsfolk of Swallow Falls in a weathering pickle. ""You have seen a meteor shower, but you have never seen a shower meatier than this"", meteorologist Sam Sparks, and main love interest, reports as juicy hamburgers descend from the sky. Flint must savour the world before it's caked with viscous syrup. Bon appetite! Orange you glad corny food puns were used to desc-rye-be the feature's plot? It was hard wok!<br/><br/>Anyway, Lord and Miller's directorial debut, an adaptation of Barrett's children's book, is a colourfully inventive animation that balances its diet of fast-paced action, witty sight humour and heartfelt familial reconciliation. The screenplay on offer showcases the energetic buoyancy that cements Lord and Miller's talent as capable screenwriters. Not all the jokes land with grace. For example the constant inclusion of ""Baby"" Brent, the town's former mascot for sardines, was nothing more than dim-witted slapstick humour. Conversely, the characterisations and mannerisms of Lockwood, his sugar-addicted pet monkey Steve, Sparks, athletic officer Earl and the greedy mayor, all host a wide array of memorability to them. Whether it be participating in an ice cream snowball fight, literally obliterating all of the neighbours on a rampage, or Flint frustratingly trying to navigate his technophobic dad around a desktop to send a simple email with an attachment.<br/><br/>The vast majority of scenes, whilst moderately zestful as children slowly develop diabetes as they constantly digest jelly beans and chocolate cake, impact towards the central character development of Flint and the fractured relationship with his father. As unsuccessful as Flint's inventions are, he believes he owes it to his deceased mother to pursue his lifelong ambition, forever determined to become the best of the best. His fisherman father, concerned about change and the welfare of his son, never expresses his belief. Therefore, there's a communicative breakdown that is only emphasised by Earl's eternal love for his son Cal. Putting aside the gigantic steaks and mustard-covered hot dogs falling from the suspiciously ominous clouds above, this story is about familial appreciation. No matter the end result. Lord and Miller consistently revert to this central theme through several scenes of sincerity. The barrage of fishing puns to accentuate that malfunction in communication between them. Transforming a relatively inevitable conclusion into a transcendental explosion of love.<br/><br/>Spaghetti tornados launching meatballs and a colossal avalanche of leftovers could not replace that poignant sentiment. Naturally, the food meteorology acts as an exercise in creative animation, granting the feature a personality of its own. Its style incredibly digestible, yet pleasantly tasty to glance at. Whilst the character models were somewhat simplistic in comparison, the animation remained vividly colourful and fluid throughout, with plenty of attentive detail for the backdrops. Food is constantly raining down, subconsciously forcing viewers to examine the entire frame to see what tasty item has descended onto the town.<br/><br/>Voice acting was appetising, with Hader and Faris commanding the cast through precise dialogue execution. Faris especially, digesting a burger and exclaiming ""I love it"", challenging such method actors including Bale and Day-Lewis. In all seriousness, she was succulent. Mr. T shouting ""Flint Lockwood"" never fails to conjure smiles, as does Bratt's Guatemalan committed line ""he is in...a food coma"". Samberg was the rotten egg of the bunch, shouting the vast majority of his dialogue with no expression or range.<br/><br/>The anchoring father relationship powers the narrative, unfortunately Flint's love interest with Sam, more often than not, overwhelms the former bond with forced development that diminishes the fragility with his father. The jelly castle distraction being an acute example of this. Removing the adoration between them would've centralised Lord and Miller's direction with Flint's father, creating a banquet rather than a main course.<br/><br/>Still, Cloudy With A Chance Of Meatballs digests its source material and spits out an inventive animation boasting with aesthetic originality and developed characters that will have you screaming for more ice cream. The chest hairs weren't always tingling, but the sumptuous aftertaste was worth it, leaving you hungry for more."

"quiqueperezsoler","6","0","0","18 April 2020"," Averagely entertaining overly-cartoonised animated movie. A little dumbed down for veteran animation fans
","As with every movie, it's inevitable to compare it to the quality set by its own genre giants like Disney PIXAR and Dreamworks. And back then they knew no better so the movie is average, it provides an easy-going fun story with quirky characters and heartwarming messages. In a way it checks all the boxes an animated feature should have in order to be considered good. It has outstanding animation a staple now of Sony Animation, just like Hotel Transylvania, and it looks really good. Compared to the rest of its titles at the time, this was the best they had done, the most engaging and cohesive but it can be considered for the top tier in animation today.<br/><br/>However, now Sony Animation is finding its voice and its recent productions not only have brought an academy award for best animated picture in ""Spiderverse"", but it has had succesful franchises like ""Hotel Transylvania"" and now a new entry with ""Connected"" which looks just as funny and entertaining.<br/><br/>I've watched all sort of animated movies, from stop-motion to computer animated to traditionally animated, from all decades and styles including non-Disney like Studio Ghibli and even other gems from Sony Animation like Hotel Transylvania and Spider-Man: Into the Spiderverse. I believe Sony Pictures Animation has a lot of potential and incredibly talented professionals working there. They have fresh and original ideas but unfortunately their track record is not very fortuitous I'm afraid.<br/><br/>They keep hitting and missing interchangeably non-stop and compared to other of its released titles, this one is one of the best. It's fun, incredibly well animated and aesthetically pleasing with great character designs and gags. But, as like with every movie, it has to be compared within its genre in order to establish a bar. Disney Pictures and Disney/PIXAR set the bar really high but other studios have met it in several occasions and so has Sony Animation winning the academy award for best animated feature Spiderverse. It seems as if Sony Animation is now realising its true potential and new releases are coming soon that look just as promising like ""Connected"" (let's hope it's a win)<br/><br/>IN CONCLUSION, the movie is harmless kids entertainment, unfortunately it'd speak little to more mature audiences as it doesn't get any deeper. It's too ridiculous and over-the-top to be taken seriously many times and due to its charicaturization the people don't seem real as they sometimes behave awkwardly and inconsistently and not in a charmful way. It doesn't have much rewatchability unless you are into ridiculous food puns and very basic plots with dumb down messages."
"pinkarray","7","0","0","28 November 2019"," Cloudy with a Chance of Tastiness
","Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs never fails to put a smile on my face. It has some clever jokes with some sweet messages about being yourself and solving world hunger. It's a very silly, over-the-top film but unlike most films like this, it actually has a lot of quiet moments like with the father-son dynamic, a few touching scenes, and a lot of development to the characters as well.<br/><br/>While the story may start off as cliched, it has a unique concept about an inventor who uses water to create food to help his impoverished town. I also loved his relationship with his father, even if the whole ""parent doesn't want child to follow his dreams"" thing is common in films, the child here is around young adult age, the age where people should be allowed to be independent and free and the relationship with his dad shows that some adults can be restricted in what they want to do. This happened with me and my mom so I found that relatable.<br/><br/>I also didn't mind the misunderstood inventor who keeps failing story. Yes, it's cliched but it goes along with the theme about being yourself, embracing your creativity, and keep trying even if you fail. A few things I didn't like about the story were the romance and third act. I thought Flint's repetitive attempts at kissing Sam were absurdly forced and at awkward moments that came out of nowhere since they just met each other and people aren't usually that brave enough to kiss their crush without built-up romantic tension. I love the Jello House scene though, I wish that was an actual attraction. I also didn't like the third act, I thought the whole thing about getting the kill code kind of dragged and the whole third act was very anticlimatic.<br/><br/>The voice cast from Bill Hader to Anna Faris to Mr. T really made the characters. I thought almost all of the characters were well-rounded. There were some that we enjoyed and some that we love to hate such as the mayor and Baby Brent. Flint is such a positive guy, he's altruistic, excitable, creative, intelligent, and passionate. I liked how Sam goes from being a dumb blonde to a girl who learns to embrace her intelligence and her passion for science. Earl is funny, he's serious about his job and I like how they used a more doting relationship between him and his son to contrast Flint and Tim's more estranged relationship. Even Tim, who disapproves of our protagonist's dream, means well and just cares about his son but has trouble expressing his feelings. He finds inventing harmful to Flint and I find that sympathetic. I didn't understand how people initially liked Brent being in his underwear as an adult but even if he was a hateful character, gets some major character development by the end, becomes useful to the plot, and becomes a more likeable character.<br/><br/>The only character that I couldn't care for was Steve, I thought he was the least developed character. He's static and added very little to the plot other than to be comic relief. He, like most monkeys is an annoying little troublemaker and I'm also against monkeys being kept as pets which is a cliche as well. He likes ripping off mustaches for some reason that they never explained and he has no backstory. I don't think he has any appeal for anyone over the age of 7 considering that I watched the movie when I was 11 and didn't like him then.<br/><br/>I didn't care for the looney tunes style animation and the ridiculous designs on Flint and Tim. It would've looked okay on a nickelodeon tv show but not on a CGI feature film.<br/><br/>I also wasn't a fan of the end credits scene, I thought it was really weird but just listen to Raining Sunshine, it's very catchy and really shows how happy the film is.<br/><br/>I give this movie a 7/10. I would've gave it an 8/10 if Steve hadn't overstayed his welcome. Just make sure you eat while you watch it."
"kevinthecritic-15200","7","0","0","26 November 2019"," Forecast: Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs Will Fill You Up
","3.5 out of 5 stars (Above average)<br/><br/>It seems that many computer-animated films get bad raps because they only use childish humor and are advertised as such, but this new film, ""Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs"" is different. It has some symbolism in it that children may not recognize, but will send parents laughing to death. Some of the actors are Anna Faris as a weather girl and female love interest and Mr. T (""Rocky 3"") as a cop with gymnastic skills. The cop is not the protagonist, however, Flint Lockwood is. Mr. Zachary Smola, my English teacher, has obviously been giving me too much literature homework (one of the reasons I haven't had time to write reviews). Let's get back to the forecast.<br/><br/>Flint (voiced by Bill Hader) is a ""mad"" scientist whose many inventions (i.e. flying car, spray-on shoes) always seem to fail. He is constantly put down by his father, Tim, policeman Earl, and everyone else on their tiny island town. Flint gets his chance to shine when the town's only income, sardines, is finally declared ""gross"" by the world (see what I meant about the parental humor) and he invents a machine that turns water into food.<br/><br/>Meet blonde weather reporter Sam Sparks. She's spunky, energetic and smarter than one may think. She too has been put down because of her smartness, and has pretended to be the house bunny AKA dumb blonde everyone expects her to be.<br/><br/>However, she is the reporter on site when Flint's food machine works and she is immediately amazed by it. She is the only one who actually understands the science of the machine so the two quickly become friends and Flint quickly becomes the town hero. This puts the original town mascot ""Baby Brent"" in the shadows. Baby Brent reminded my mom of the Coppertone Baby-you'll have to see the film to understand why. Meanwhile, Mayor Shelbourne, of course, starts to demand more and more food of the machine, as his intentions are to put the town back onto the map again and to become Bill Gates-rich. This causes the machine to rain down food-like weather patterns by itself; (think a spaghetti version of ""The Day After Tomorrow"") therefore Flint, Sam, Brent, and Sam's cameraman have to save the world.<br/><br/>""Cloudy"" sounds like so many other CGI films you have heard about lately, but this one is different. The humor is original, and you can actually care that Flint's mom dies, something in movies that usually makes me say ""yeah, yeah, yeah."" The 3D is noticeable, but it doesn't take up the whole film. You should see this film if you have kids and are interested in some nice humor that centers around your stomach instead of the john. Of course, the entrance to Flint's lab is a Port-A-Potty.<br/><br/>Rated PG for brief mild language. Note-the mild language is he-double hockey sticks used once. The kids won't hear it unless they are really paying attention."

I mean the film mostly just take the central concept and a few of the visual motifs from the book. It switches genres from fantasy/fairy tale to science fiction. It introduces every character in the film as a new character, Yet for all that this is one of the best adaptations I have seen. It takes the concept into a different direction and builds a rather touching father-son story around it. The humor is daft. The characters are utterly vivid. And they stick the landing on the emotional story beats.<br/><br/>The animation is a lot more cartoony than a lot of animated films. It makes sense that the same two guys that made this would go to make the Lego Movie and Spiderverse.

Although that Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs doesn't have some creativity with food and a bit of heart, it doesn't change the fact that it's a good movie that delivers a familiar story, along with likable characters, and possibly the best animation in the history of cinema, if i must make a recommendation, just watch the movie, that thing should even be as popular as it is now, and read the original book it was based on, I can tell you that the book has a lot of charm and pleasant and it has something that the movie did have during it's making, a professional artist who worked on it. Would this be the best animated film out there? Yes, i will say it's as good as it's average sequel or most of the Weinstein films, but if that's the case, would that be the reason why I have a celebration with this film, because, it's a good movie? Well, technically yes, but not quite, the full answer is much more complex. Animation is having a easy time to be a film medium except a genre only meant for kids. What this film is doing is enforcing that stereotype making the industry look good by presenting something only film buffs with a sense of good quality can easily be distracted too, but what makes it even better in this case is how people are so giving to this film just by how it is as a good film mediums film, and the minor novelties it offered, rather it be from the character animation and design, to the big use of respectable actors like Mr. T, Neil Patrick Harris, James Caan, and Bruce Campbell, and the fact that this is the directorial debut of Phil Lord and Chris Miller, who would leave Sony Animation in order to make more good films for once. Just because it's niceness, it gives the public a idea that all animated films are just cool cartoons only catered to buffs. And what makes this even better is that Sony Animation is continuing to enforce this notion with more films that continue the tradition of good writing and awesome overly-cartoony animation. Because of the news of the company is moving from LA, California to Vancouver, Canada, I will pray for the industry's sake that this means a fresh start for Sony, but otherwise they will see the same fate as those who stood in Vancouver. If there will ever be a day when animation will be looked upon, then this film should just stay, in the coolness that shares with other films of the same quality, like Layton and the Eternal Diva, Mars Needs Moms and Space Chimps, because like the mentioned, this is nothing more than cartoon art. In fact, as Flint Lockwood himself said it best ""this is art, this is art, this is art."" and for the art that it is, the only thing it deserves, is the Coltonversal. Seal. Of. Approval!"

","'Cloudy With A Chance Of Meatballs (2009)' might just about be Lord and Miller's weakest film, but that just goes to show how good they truly are. Frankly, this would be most people's magnum opus. While many of this flick's jokes can be seen - at least, in spirit - in their later entries with slightly tighter timing and, perhaps, bigger scope, that doesn't reduce their often absolute hilarity and general inventiveness. The fact that you can see where they've improved doesn't make their first attempt any less successful. It's great. The meat-and-potatoes of the piece - or, at least, its comedy - is the sight-gag, the funniest of which involves a walking TV stealing a man from an electronics shop during a riot (you just have to see it). It's very funny and it's very fun, too, which is arguably more important. It also has a well-rounded, fast-paced and fairly moving story chock full of memorable and endearing characters. The cherry on the food-pile is its colourful, cartoony animation which makes each frame a feast for the eyes. It's just so enjoyable.

","They can do great and inventive animation at the drop of a hat these days, as evidenced by Storks and Book of Life I've seen recently, so to be REALLY good, it must come down to story and pacing and emotional investment. That kind of thing can leave an otherwise inventive film like Book of Life in the dust, especially when compared to a similar film like Coco. It can leave a film like Storks somewhere decidedly in the middle of the pack, even when charming. And it can raise a film you don't necessarily expect much from, like Cloudy with a Chance. Despite some hyper, overblown action, especially towards the end, there is something sweet at its core, a story about a bullied, quirky scientist who finds acceptance by all the wrong people with his invention that turns water into food, his sweet relationship with the weather girl until he almost ruins it with his newfound fame, and the disconnected relationship he has with his Dad. It's very sweet, and I identified - a lot - with the feelings and motivations of the main character.

So, his father has him work in his bait shop full time. Not going to give up easily, Flint has one more invention up his sleeve, one that should create food out of water for the sardine overdosed population of the island where he lives. And like all the others, this one ends in failure, too, even destroying Sardineland, whose opening Sam Sparks, an intern from the Weather News Network, was covering. But then, there are signs of success... <br/><br/>With animation that is less than satisfying and unimaginative, the best that could be said about """"Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs"""" is that it does manage to be silly on occasion with one great joke. And with the exception of Bruce Campbell's fantastic vocal work, that's pretty much it.(Does he do a lot of this or did somebody else miss their calling?) While I do salute the movie for favoring intelligence, especially with women, it does not help that the so called hero is something of a jerk. And the central message surrounding overconsumption and the 'obesity epidemic' is severely heavy handed when considering that Flint's invention would have great potential for those parts of the globe where people are going hungry."""

","With his hometown of Swallow Falls teetering on the edge of bankruptcy, would-be super inventor Flint Lockwood unleashes his newest creation on the world and watches as it literally takes on a life of his own. After failed inventions like Ratbirds, Monkey Translators, and non-flying Flying Cars, Flint introduces a machine that instantly pops out any food that you might ask it for. In a town that almost exclusively dines upon sardines, this is potentially big business. His invention, however, somehow shoots itself off into space and, like a satellite sending TV signals back down to the population, drops giant quantities of food onto the plates of Swallow Falls. This makes Flint a hero, of course, but the popularity only leads to big problems, mainly due to the fact that the townspeople want more and more, finally taking the machine past the point of safety and smothering the town (and the world) in giant bagels, hamburgers, and the obligatory meatballs. Flint and his gang must stop the machine before the food overtakes the entire world.<br/><br/>""Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs"" is based on a beloved children's book of the same name. Visually speaking it is unquestionably one of the better non-Pixar animated films I've ever seen. Absolutely stunning visuals. The story is quite original (obviously) and it's very easy to get sucked into to the absurdity of the tale. And the voice talent is as good as you could possibly get for an animated feature. Every voice is a somebody and more importantly, all of the voices work in concert and no one voice dominates the screen. ""Cloudy"" isn't the funniest cartoon movie I've ever seen but there are enough laughs to go around. What is it that is so funny about a talking animal? Dug the talking dog was perhaps the best character in ""Up"" last year and in this case Steve the talking monkey brought about more laughs for me than anything else. Somebody needs to study this phenomenon. Anyway, the overall impact of ""Cloudy"" doesn't quite reach the heights of the Pixar products or Dreamworks' ""How to Train Your Dragon"" but it is a quality film with a fantastic world in which to operate and a great deal of fun.<br/><br/>My site, the Soap Box Office: www.thesoapboxoffice.blogspot.com"

It doesn't have to be original, but I do expect something worthwhile. ""Monster House"" is such an example. I thought the characters and story were pleasant enough.

","It's pretty clear from the start when the Sony Pictures Animation logo comes up that this is not a film that'll take itself too seriously and rightly so, given the main concept: food, falling from the sky like rain.<br/><br/>The voice acting is pretty solid all round - Hader as the misunderstood scientist, Caan as the doubting dad Tim, Faris as the bubbly reporter Sam and of course Mr T playing what seems to be an enthusiastic acrobatic policeman.<br/><br/>Plot-wise it's really simple, clichéd and predictable. The main characters are archetypes. I thought while watching it, some gags were so quick, it's as if they threw as many jokes as they could at the wall, and what stuck, they kept.<br/><br/>OTT and sometimes bizarre, some jokes are very funny in a silly way, and a few are witty. Some don't work as they try to hard, but these days, family animated films seem to think that's the best way to keep ADD kids interested through constant jokes and it shouldn't always be like that.<br/><br/>I didn't like the romance between Sam and Flint as it just felt very forced - hey Hollywood, not everyone of the opposite sex with similar interests needs to end up together, you know. Seriously, it's getting annoying.<br/><br/>Also didn't like Mr T's character repeating the 'I love you son' - got a bit mushy for my taste. Maybe some realism in there like maybe the uneaten mountain of food rotting with maggots, since the pile mostly looked like a giant kid's fake plastic food used for for make-believe role playing.<br/><br/>The animation is pretty decent. I still think they could've incorporated the illustrations from the picture book(which I've never read, but have seen the cover online), to give it a very distinctive seventies look.<br/><br/>What is in there, character design wise, looks like Betty Spaghetti dolls mixed with a dash of Pixar. So, generic, but does the job as it's colourful and blockily animated, that gives it that instant familiarity that should make it accessible.<br/><br/>The score is good, although with such a fantasy plot as raining food, there could've been more creative and innovative themes. I liked the song Raining Sunshine at the end, though.<br/><br/>Overall: It's not brilliant, but for what it sets out to do, which is pretty much 77 mins of diverting and funny entertainment, there are far worse options out there.<br/><br/>Bright, bonkers and fun, all ages should devour this easily.<br/><br/>If this film could be described as a weather forecast, it'd be sunny intervals."

Despite some flaws in the narrative, it's a solid hit for the company. <br/><br/>With the voice talents of Bill Hader, Anna Faris, and James Caan, this light-hearted comedy is well worth the watch. Perhaps it's too light. There's no deep powerful message to be learned that you haven't heard before. It's very aesthetically pleasing as some of the other animated films this year. The land of ice cream scene was especially appetizing. And there is a terrific love story at the core of the film. Flint (Hader) and Sam (Faris) are the cutest of cute in terms of geeks in love. Directors Phil Lord and Chris Miller were very clever in the execution in the beauty of their relationship despite being based on the book.<br/><br/>Is this the Oscar frontrunner for Animated Feature film?

Kids will enjoy this one, which many of them have.

","Sony Pictures Animation is slowly building up its resume. First there was surprise hit Monster House followed by the mediocre Open Season, then the solid Surf's Up and the straight-to-DVD Open Season 2. A couple of decent outings but definitely not much to boast about. Meatballs goes a small way in changing that for this new animation production company, but not as much as it should have.<br/><br/>Raining food: what a wonderful premise. And it's made to order no less. Adapted from the novel of the same name, the first half of the movie opens up a terrific world that looks like ours but actually has limitless potential whilst the second half makes you wish the filmmakers exercised more control over the endless possibilities that were clearly available to them. There is a fairly consistent string of laughs across the 90 minutes however when it transitions from the little-movie-that-could to near superhero proportions at the hour mark it feels unnecessary, subsequently detracting from the end result.<br/><br/>Flint is a likable protagonist thanks to Bill Hader's skillful voicing. At times when he could have easily become sooky or self-loathing, Hader's charisma ensures you never forget who you are rooting for. There are a range of hit-and-miss supporting players: Flint's love-interest Sam Sparks (Faris) is delightful, Mr T's energetic copper and Samberg's adult-baby are both humorous whilst Flint's father is over-dramatic, Campbell's Mayor is tedious and the pet monkey that can talk, Steve (Harris), outstays his welcome in a hurry.<br/><br/>Thanks to the vibrancy of the animation and the high-concept story kiddies will surely want to go back for seconds and thirds, although parents will probably find this first sitting just enough.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 (1 - Rubbish, 2 - Ordinary, 3 - Good, 4 - Excellent, 5 - Classic)"
"Quinoa1984","8","4","15","18 September 2009"," a big mega-hit blockbuster... and other things
","Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs took me by surprise. I went in on a near-whim - or, in other words, very positive critical buzz and the word of some specific critics I trust. As it turns out, it's got nowhere near the mastery of storytelling of Pixar's Up, nor the kind of cult-movie ambition of the sleeper 9 by Shane Acker. No, but it is by far the funniest animated movie to come out this year, maybe just as funny as Kung-fu Panda from last year. The directors, Phil Lord and Chris Miller, treat the source material as a pure jumping off point (a 10 page short story for kids done in a captivating and unusual style for a children's book), and it just get completely crazy from about five minutes (or just minute-one) on. And while it is probably more for kids, if you're an adult- or just a dude in his 20's with fond memories of Rocko's Modern Life and Animaniacs, it will do more than just make you smile. You'll be laughing, a lot.<br/><br/>It just takes absurdism to heights that can't be topped, at least this week. The main idea is that Flint Lockwood is an inventor, usually of stuff that works but not on a grand enough scale (like spray-on shoes and a voice-defibrillator or something that is able to make his monkey Steve express his thoughts like ""HUNGRY HUNGRY!""), and he one day invents a device that can use radiation and water to make up any food programmed in the system. It needs energy though, so after a (botched?) attempt at a power station, Flint's machine get launched up in the air to the clouds, and from there weather and purely unnatural events cause perfectly edible Cheeseburgers to rain down everywhere. From there, Flint's semi-career takes off, as well as the courting of a weather-girl, Sam Sparks, who secretly was one (gasp) a nerd.<br/><br/>Oh there's so much craziness here that one can't describe it. That is, unless, you are already on a high of candy or soda and can relate to a scene like when a frustrated policeman (Mr. T - yes, Mr. T) wants Flint to do something special for his son's birthday, and the next day it's an entire neighborhood of ice cream - which then goes into a snow-fight of ice cream, and snow angels of ice cream, and Flint's first ever participation in a snow-fight where he practically slaughters the kids with his hard-hitting ice-cream-ball accuracy. Or that monkey, Steve, or those rat-birds Flint invented years ago that roam the beaches and town like Hitchcock-Bird parodies, or the Mayor (voiced wonderfully by Bruce Campbell, didn't recognize him at all), or just little things like Flint's dad's bushy eyebrows and mustache (""Look in my eyes when you say that,"" he says at one point). Did I mention the romantic jello mold or the bad puns like when chicken drumsticks rain to with Sam replies, ""Poultry in motion!"" <br/><br/>There's much more to get into, not least of which the big big BIG climax of the movie, which starts to roll into Godzilla territory with how insane it gets. And, more often than not, the jokes are more sophisticated than one might expect, and flew over more than a few of the kid's heads (not to say some jokes are more squared right at kids specifically, which is fine). One of these, ""Let's Diem that Carpe,"" work almost a few seconds after the joke is told, but a lot of them are just purely visual gags. And even more than Up, which had its share of laughs, 'Meatballs' cashes in on the whole visual cache of raining food, and all of the varieties, and the truly original idea of having a monkey on a flying car fighting evil gummi bears. Oh yes, it's one of those movies, and if you're just after ridiculously hungry imagery, this is the place to go. It's a vibrant and imaginative cartoon, loaded with gags, a little bit of heart, and some predictability. If I had a kid I'd make him/her see it with me twice - even if they were fine with just the once."

","Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs was (thankfully) one of those films that both parents and children can enjoy. It contains both slapstick humour and more subtle satirical jokes. The writing is superb as is the directing. The animation, on the other hand is unremarkable and the voice-work was mediocre, as well. This is, however, overshadowed by a fantastic plot and great jokes.<br/><br/>First of all, just because the people who do the voices are famous, does not mean they are necessarily good voice actors. With the exception of Mr. T, the acting ranges from mediocre to weak. This is really my only complaint and I think it's time we get back to actually hiring real voice-actors as opposed to random celebrities. Bill Hader did a rather poor job, I'm afraid.<br/><br/>The story, however, is excellent, brilliantly expanding on the original book. The dialogue is funny and often very witty as well. There are very well-done dramatic scenes and also some very humorous ones. The film starts out strong and keeps the viewer interested. Slowly, as the problem with the food escalates, the film becomes darker and more emotional. The main romantic story is handled very well for a children's film and has a great (albeit not very original) theme of individuality. The film also incorporates Flint's conflict with his father in a clash of technology and old-fashioned values.<br/><br/>The animation I am divided on. Unlike most films viewers, the visuals are of secondary importance to me. The directing was excellent and most of the animation was actually really good- that is, the setting, the background, the food etc. The only part of it that I disliked were the characters- I'm not sure why, but.... meh.<br/><br/>I definitely recommend this film for both children and adults as it contains plenty of entertainment for both. Its flaws are steamrolled by an excellent script and great humour.<br/><br/>7/10"

","There's nothing wrong with the animation, art design or production values of this animated feature. Nothing wrong with the arc of the main story either (structurally or morally), or with the voice acting.<br/><br/>The reason I couldn't really get into it is that nobody acts like a real person; all the characters act like Hollywood stereotypes imagined by someone who doesn't actually have friends. It never feels like a single character in the film is actually real or has a soul, so it's hard to care about what's going on, aside from admiring it in the sense one might admire a roller coaster ride. A few days before I saw this, I watched the animated ""A Christmas Carol"" which came out the same year, and it is a great contrast; I could actually believe that the people in ""Christmas Carol"" were real and care about what happened to them, despite the ridiculous roller-coaster action sequences (which both films have).<br/><br/>The other thing which bugged me is that nobody in ""Meatballs"" has to work hard to make something they want happen; they just have to really want it and then suddenly they can easily do it. Inventor builds multi-million dollar lab and inventions effortlessly (the complete polar opposite of what actual work in science is like). Fat guy (near the end) suddenly becomes martial arts master just because he really, really wants to and the plot requires it.<br/><br/>It gives the wrong lesson about the value of work and discipline (namely, that one doesn't need them, that just to have a good idea is enough), but the primary fault is that it just made it hard for me to care about what was going on in the movie, particularly as none of the characters even felt relatable in the first place."

","This family friendly film is about an inventor who creates a machine to distribute food instead of water around the world. When the machine gets out of control, the world could be destroyed by an abundance of food. I did enjoy the film's super animation with its realistic people and settings. The colorfulness in the environment is well received. Anna Faris plays a likable weather forecaster. Bill Hader plays the voice of the inventor. The story is unrealistic but the film does manage to pull it off. I found the film weakest in the storyline and character development. I rarely recognized the voices of notable actors and actresses in their characters. Their characters were developed and their voices weren't necessary needed by A-list actors and actresses. The only two voices that mattered were Hader and Faris who did a stunning job in their roles. Their characters weren't developed enough though and the film's storyline is overshadowed by its poor development. For a family film, it is enjoyable all around.

I think the sequel to this movie is better, but this movie is great and you must watch it before the sequel to fully understand.<br/><br/>This movie centers around Flint Lockwood, a young man who thinks he's a genius and is always inventing things. He lives in a community where basically the only food they have are sardines. But then Flint invents a machine to make food fall from the sky, like rain, so the town can have something good to eat, for once.

","Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs, released in a year with some other big contenders of animated films like Up and Monsters vs. Aliens, had to hold it's own. I wasn't sure how this film was going to be, the trailer did look cute, but some critics were saying that the film didn't meet their expectations. So I decided to wait for the rent, which honestly I'm glad I did. While the film is very good and very much worth the watch, I wasn't really excited like I normally am for a film like this. I've seen so many ""let's rub a message down the kid's throat"" movies that it does tend to get a little boring and predictable. Now I know it's always meant for the kids who haven't dealt with a message or moral before, but at least for the adults, give us something too. That's why I love a lot of animated films today, because there is humor for the adults as well and this was more aimed for the kids. But if there is one thing that I give the film credit for is the incredible animation.<br/><br/>Flint Lockwood is a young scientist whose inventions have all ended in disaster. Flint's latest invention is a machine that converts water molecules into food. It doesn't work due to the lack of electricity at his home, so when he is forced by his unsupportive and technophobic father Tim Lockwood to work at his Bait 'n' Tackle shop. He soon meets Sam Sparks, a cute weather intern whose big break was ruined by Flint's ""rocket"", an invention that ruined a big event in his town. When the two witness giant purple clouds raining cheeseburgers over Swallow Falls, Sam reports the events and mentions Flint is responsible. Flint becomes famous overnight, but becomes overwhelmed with the townspeople's requests for food. The greedy Mayor Shelbourne, convinces Flint to create even more food in an effort to turn Swallow Falls into a new tourist attraction. Of course though as the town gets greedier with the food demand, the machine starts to break down and may end up destroying the town with the crazy weather.<br/><br/>As I was saying with the animation, this has a very memorable scene that I will never forget, when the machine is going all hay-wire, there is a spaghetti tornado that is just incredible to look at. The story for kids is definitely good and the whole story is very charming and original. But like I said, it just has a few flaws that I'm not crazy about. Like casting Mr. T in the movie, I don't mind that he's in a movie, however when it's more like him just playing himself than a character, then there's no point in casting him when you could get a lesser known actor trying to make it. Bill Hader as Flint over all worked pretty well with the character and voice, he has a certain awkwardness that does blend well and makes the story believable. Anna Faris, again I love her, but not sure if they really needed her for this movie as she's not that memorable. James Caan is the only stand out performance in the film for me, he's the disapproving father who Flint is constantly trying got get the approval from. Caan always delivers a power house performance and this was no exception. Over all Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs is worth the watch as a rental for the kids. It's a good family film, but not so much for the adults, just a warning in advance. I was expecting more and was disappointed, but still it was worth the watch and the animation was really good.<br/><br/>6/10"

","I don't know what really made me see this film. I just saw this film with my best friend out of my instincts. I must have really good instincts because I really enjoyed this movie. This has to be the best animated feature I saw this year(have not seen Up yet). This movie is just plain fun. It's nice to hear that little kids and older adults enjoyed this movie together. That usually does not happen.<br/><br/>This film is based off the novel with the same name. The main character is a failure of an inventor. Everyone thinks he's an outcast. One day, he invents a food machine. Due to a problem, the machine goes into the clouds and starts raining food. But too much food can cause problems.<br/><br/>This film certainly has a talented voice cast of Anna Faris, Bill Hader, James Caan, Al Roker, and more. They're all really good. Overall, this is a pleasant movie that got ripped by the Oscars. Where's the Best Animated Feature nomination? I rate this film 10/10."

","Based on Judi Barrett's 1978 children's book of the same name, CLOUDY WITH A CHANCE OF MEATBALLS hits the right spot for kids and adults alike. It is whimsical almost to the point of such old cartoons as The Road Runner and Popeye. Which I found to be a refreshing break from the more in-your-face animated features that try to stuff political/social commentary down our gullets (see WALL-E and HAPPY FEET as two that did this to an extreme degree). Now I'm not saying that we shouldn't try and educate little Johnny and Jane, but we should, sometimes, give their minds a break and allow them a moment of sheer entertainment. And CWaCoMB does that.<br/><br/>Take one part kid scientist-wannabe and add to the mix an intelligent weather forecaster and a father who wants his son to join the family business, and you get spaghetti tornadoes, cheeseburger hailstorms, and Jello castles. Yep. That's the type of whimsy I'm talking about.<br/><br/>Bill Hader (TROPIC THUNDER) stars as the voice for Flint Lockwood, the crazy kid scientist who's creations seem to go wrong more often than not. But his one creation, a machine that mutates water into food, is a resounding success. That is, until something goes terribly wrong. But before it does, Flint meets up with sexy newscaster Sam Sparks (Anna Faris, MY SUPER EX-GIRLFRIEND), who caught a break and is on the scene in Flint's sardine stricken town when his new machine launches itself into the stratosphere and starts making it rain food. Sam is very excited by this astronomical development. But on Flint's other side is his father, Tim (James Caan), who only wants his son to stop these ridiculous experiments and get into the family bait and tackle business.<br/><br/>As Flint's machine begins raining down watermelons instead of water, the people of Flint's town become enamored with their new whiz kid and the world's interest in their little corner of the globe. This includes town Mayor Shelbourne (Bruce Campbell, SPIDERMAN 3) who's gluttonous nature (in both food and fame) lead not just their own town, but nearly the entire planet, into ruin. Flint's machine goes into overload mode when too much is asked of it and, in fact, it begins to resemble features we've seen in various science fiction films. Remember the egg layer in ALIENS? Make sure you look at the machine whenever Flint and his crew catch up to it toward the end of the film. And sentient food that plans to destroy its maker? Foodinator! (Ahem... I mean Terminator). And remember the first STAR TREK motion picture with V-GER? How the Enterprise had to go through layers of V-GER's outer ""ship"" in order to reach its core? Keep an eye out for those similarities, too.<br/><br/>So the film has a few extra bangs for fans that pay attention. But even if you don't, it'll still be very entertaining. And it won't be shoving poli-sci junk down your throat, which ought to at least please a few of us on news media overload."
"Ayreesfoxx","9","1","2","5 January 2010"," Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs: Gonna Need an Anti-acid Too
","I remember when I was five-years-old, going down to my local library with all of the other little children on a class field-trip to get the average gander of what exactly happen in a library. To start off the trip, a stooped and arthritic little figure read us this magical book, where food and drink fell from the sky every day. The idea was glorious, and for all of the little kids around, we were mesmerized. Little did I know that this one story would help spur my way into writing (and being slightly overweight as a child), but it would also help create an interesting little movie some thirty years after it was published<br/><br/>The movie, directed by Phil Lord and Chris Miller, takes the simple concept of food falling from the sky and pushes it to the next level with Flint Lockwood (Bill Hader). Flint is an amateur inventor whose projects just don't seem to work out right in their dying town. Yet when his invention that turns water into food is propelled into the upper atmosphere, Flint becomes the hero of the town and starts filling out orders for everyone's favorite treat. However, there is always a price to these simplistic and harmless looking miracles, and weather girl/love interest Sam Sparks (Anna Faris) has to help Flint before he inadvertently causes the end to his little town, and the rest of the world. <br/><br/>Visually, it isn't anything spectacular. It does have its moments of sparkle; a glass shattering here or water splashing there, but that's all that she wrote. Yet what this movie lacks in jaw-dropping finesse, it brings back in marvelous color. The town of Chewandswallow begins stark and grey, since it's an obvious dying and boring town. Yet once Flint turns on his machine, the hues of red, gold, blue, and everything in between shine through. It's truly a movie to play with if you have a Blu-Ray player and have been desperate to test it out with something with the kids.<br/><br/>And speaking of kids, this is a well-done kids movie that keep anyone entertained. Jokes come fast and come in a manner that leaves you laughing for a minute or two, only to catch your breath and the have another joke thrown in your face. Although half of it is slapstick for the younger audience, it is done tastefully enough that you can at least appreciate the majority of the jokes. They respectfully forgo any and all of the body humor jokes, keeping it upscale (or as much as you can in a movie where the characters gorge themselves), leaving you simply happy by the end of it. <br/><br/>The voice actors did a great job bringing their characters to life. Hader and Faris together create a cornucopia of awkwardness that propels the story and love interest. Hader himself did an amazing job with bringing his character to life, making you almost believe that someone as eccentric as Flint could live right behind you. Faris could have potentially toned down her peppy honestly, yet with the help of the supporting cast like Mr. T (who did an amazing job being himself, small wonder) it was hardly noticeable.<br/><br/>All in all, this is just a nice and respectable movie to watch with the family or with a big group of friends after a long day. I could see myself enjoying this over and over really, without having any problems against it. Unfortunately, the issues of getting hungry as you watch this movie, that doesn't go away in fact it just gets worse as it goes on. By the time the credits roll, you better be planning something for a midnight snack, or you will be kicking yourself for it later."

"jaredmobarak","8","1","2","30 December 2009"," A film by a lot of people  Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs
","I knew right after the above review title quote flashed across the screen that Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs was going to be a fun time. Sony Pictures Animation did not let me down, keeping me enthralled and smiling for the entire duration. Based on a children's book from 1978, the film follows the exploits of a young scientist and his dreams of changing the world with his inventions. Up to adulthood, however, he has achieved little more that a 'menace to society' label from everyone in his small island town of Swallow Falls, where the staple of sardines has become there only source of food now that the world has realized they're gross. Small and subtle jokes such as this statement as a newspaper headline are sprinkled throughout to keep the audience's sense of humor on its toes while the feel-good story in the background continues on, reaching forward to the inevitable nerd-to-hero transformation wherein Flint Lockwood grows up and into his full potential.<br/><br/>The invention that becomes the final straw for Flint's disturbing the peace shenanigans is a machine that converts water into food, giving the people of his hometown something to eat besides the overabundance of sardines. Its baptism to the world is a disaster, ruining the mayor's asinine use of government money on a new theme park, soon becoming a happy accident of epic proportions. A malfunction due to too much power—I guess connecting the machine to an electrical tower wasn't the best of ideas—sends it into the atmosphere where it hovers above, taking in the cloud moisture and raining down hamburgers for all to enjoy. Let's not get into details about how that burger will be hot enough to be appetizing because there is a lot more to worry about, such as newfound fame in the community and the world. Flint is the toast of the town and fresh face of newly renamed Chew and Swallow, usurping the monopoly 'Baby' Brent had on the market after posing for sardine tins many years before. Even the cute weather girl intern sent to broadcast it all seems to be falling for him, she herself hiding nerd tendencies and a strong grasp of the scientific beneath her flighty, blonde facade.<br/><br/>Mutations are never an exact science and soon the food falling from the sky becomes too large and dangerous to contain. It becomes up to Flint and his friends to risk it all and save the town before the invention—named with a crazy acronym that has about six consonants and one vowel—takes over the world. The mayor wants nothing to change, except his ever-expanding waistband, and in an accidentally villainous role makes things even worse, using the 'like a son' card with the lad, made more meaningful by the lack in ability to express love from his real Dad. So, amidst the chaos, we meet a plethora of kooky characters all voiced by some great comedic actors as they try and help our lead regain control over the one invention that actually works. Well, that statement is a bit harsh considering that everything he's created—from a young elementary student until now—has worked. It's just that they all had minor problems turning that success into hazard or worse. Spray-on shoes is a great concept if you can ever remove them; monkey thought converters would be groundbreaking if a monkey ever could string together more than one loud word at a time, (great Neil Patrick Harris as Steve); and rat-birds would solve  wait, what was he thinking with that one? I did like when one swooped down and snatched a child to which his friends screamed, ""Just play dead!"" The animation is really crisp and vibrant, utilizing a cartoony feel rather than a need for realism. Each character is an elongated caricature of a human, adding a sense of style that allows an audience to enter a new world and bask in the creativity. I do kind of wish I had seen it in 3D, though, because multiple instances appear to play to that technology's strengths. There are a few chase sequences that have us following the leads as they run and jump through obstacles flying out at our faces. But, the biggest compliment I can pay to the film is the fact that I enjoyed myself thoroughly without the gimmick. Every joke hits and the story is fun enough to succeed on its own merits. There is definitely something to be said about absurd comedic set pieces existing for the sole purpose to make you laugh. Oneliners abound, sometimes said in the distance so keep your ears open, and sight gags enhance the hilarity, oftentimes reminding me of the humor found in ""Family Guy"", only much cleaner for the young audience targeted here.<br/><br/>Bill Hader is great as Flint, with a sort of crazed innocence coming across, so sure of himself in the scientific world, yet completely unconfident in the realm of real-life relationships. Both James Caan and Anna Faris, as his father and love interest Sam Sparks respectively, are casting perfection. Faris is a riot; using that bimbo voice she pulls off so well to great use, especially when she has to talk about something brainy and genius-caliber smart. Samberg is a hoot as Brent and Bruce Campbell is channeling a bit of William Shatner in his portrayal of Mayor Shelbourne, but it is the venerable Mr. T as Officer Earl Devereaux that shines in the supporting category. It is such a treat to hear his voice—a wonderful complement to the overzealously athletic policeman. Everything is working within Phil Lord and Chris Miller's film, from the heart to the jokes to the visuals. It may not stand a chance against Up for awards glory, but it definitely sets itself apart as a film to be seen."
"Chrysanthepop","Null","1","2","6 December 2009"," A World Of Unlimited Fast Food
","What a wonderful movie to watch with your children. Based on a famous children's book 'Cloudy With A Chance Of Meatballs' is a charming and funny little film. For me its main strength was the characters. The characters are easy to relate to because all of them have their own insecurities and issues.<br/><br/>They are portrayed as flawed humans rather than the perfect heroes. For example, Flint Lockwood lying about his peanut allergy to impress the girl, Sam Sparks dumbing herself down to make herself more likable, Tim Lockwood limiting his son's dream because he thinks Flint would have a more secure future if he worked at the store. At the same time the humour is plentiful to keep the viewer laughing. I liked the 'message' that the film tries to bring to kids: That too much of anything (in this case tasty food) is bad and to always be yourself (things that even some adults ought to apply). Perhaps in a subtle way, this film also portrays how fast-food is abundantly consumed in America and how the culture today is obsessed about it.<br/><br/>The animation is vivacious and pleasantly colourful. The voice acting that includes Bill Hader, Anna Faris, James Caan, Benjamin Bratt and Lauren Graham is solid. I also enjoyed the references it made to other sci-fi movies and series like 'Independence Day', Armageddon', 'Men In Black' (these three are lesser movies in my opinion), 'The Twilight Zone' etc. 'Cloudy With A Chance Of Meatballs' is the sort of film that makes you become a child (in a good way) for 90 minutes. It's imaginative, it's hilarious, it's good eye candy, what's not to like?"

","This comment is on the IMAX 3D version.<br/><br/>This is superficially another lame morality play, with a childishly simple set of coordinated arcs: temptations, love and family. It features inventiveness as the talent, and I suppose we should be thankful it isn't sports.<br/><br/>But I found two things to really like about this, like enough to recommend it.<br/><br/>The first is that of the IMAX 3d animated films, it is the first I recall that used the expanded dimensionality in a way that was natural. It expanded the cinematic vocabulary and wasn't gimmicky. A word about the balance: when you have something new, the first goal is to make it seem as if it were always there, I think. Only then can you start to exploit what it offers in communicative power. It has taken us years to get here. Pixar couldn't. WETA couldn't, nor any of the SKG projects. It took Sony, who may actually be developing some skills. <br/><br/>I was impressed by how they handled space as a narrative device in their first production: ""Monster House."" Here, they simply enfold space as if you naturally were there, including emulating shots from many, many other movies — the ones we have seen so many times that we accept them as natural. Star Wars space navigation for instance.<br/><br/>That takes me to the second really wonderful thing. The people who made this know and love movies. There are scores of direct references: obvious ones from space and alien movies of course. Nice, esoteric ones as well, like the passing reference to ""Eat, Drink, Man, Woman."" There were as many of those as my mind could collect, probably one every couple minutes, every setup. But it seemed as well that even framing, lighting, color balance and movements of different kinds were references as well.<br/><br/>We will have to wait for some clever entrepreneur to make a movie annotation site where you can enter a scene's framing and search the corpus of movies to see where it came from, possibly intuitively. But they are there. This is a cinephile's cartoon. <br/><br/>The ""girl"" is a redhead of course. Of passing interest is the way that the acceptable shape of female bodies has evolved in this sort of manufactured world. Characters are an engineered mix of suppressing and exaggerating in some coordinated way, so that the backstory of the person can be read from the form of their body shape. <br/><br/>In films made with living actresses, the form is in the motion, carriage, dance. Here it can literally be in the shape, those subtle movements still being beyond the technology. Here, she is all pelvis and thighs. Now this is no small matter because these simple forms will affect a whole generation of desires and the pattern of caresses. These forms matter, and it is remarkable that Sony has these skills.<br/><br/>Watch them. Its exciting to see spatially cinematic competence. The jello scene must have been the first conceived. It is transcendent. <br/><br/>Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching."
"elicopperman","5","1","3","9 January 2018"," Sorry, but This Hasn't Aged Well
","Back in 2009 when Sony Pictures Animation released their animated film adaptation of the children's book of the same name, I loved it at the age of ten. Watching in recently however, I find it pretty mediocre. That's not to say I hate it or anything, this is just a case of a form of media from childhood that didn't really age well...for me at least.<br/><br/>In terms of what works, the real highlight of the film is the animation on the food, from the quantity, to the size, to especially the colors. I always found food to look a million times better in animation than in real life, and this movie is no exception. Not to mention, the animators found a lot of creative methods to build the food as either houses or amusement rides. Adding on to that, some of the jokes are pretty funny, although others are rather juvenile. The fathers Earl and Tim are the most likable and charming characters in the whole film, especially since they want what's best for their children in spite of their oddball antics. Lastly, I admire the different inventions the filmmakers created that definitely fit with the movie's imaginative touch. <br/><br/>Unfortunately, what doesn't work is the story, as it comes off as too cliche and predictable for it's own good using the same old underdog story we've seen before. I was able to predict everything that was going to happen, and the main character Flint Lockwood is way too dorky and obnoxious for his own good. The rest of the cast are either forgettable, annoying, just there to get a laugh, or are just pointless entirely (although Sam Sparks is enjoyably quirky in her own right). Also, I get that they wanted to make the characters cartoony to fit with the movie's oddball nature, but their designs are so simplistic and so over the top that it looks both ridiculous and awkward, and the animators were trying way too hard with the wackiness. Not to mention, while the subplot with Flint's father-son relation is heartwarming enough, it feels overshadowed by juvenile humor, pointless moments with Flint and other residents, and I was left much to be desired. <br/><br/>Once again, I don't hate this movie by any means, I just don't like it as much as I used to. While I admire the food visuals, the occasional likable and silly character, some of the jokes, and message to never give up on your dreams, the predictable story, majority pos obnoxious characters, and annoying character animation keep me from enjoying it all the way through. If you love the book more than you're better off with that, but if you do have a soft spot for this movie than definitely have fun with it. You'll certainly gain a bigger appetite that I did."
"hc-18804","4","1","3","17 August 2017"," Garbage
","This is a bad movie, plain and simple. First off, the character animation is atrocious. The designs look awful, and the movement is unwatchable. The humor is also very juvenile, with very few jokes that actually work. The main character, Flint, is very unlikeable. In fact, most of the characters are awful. Tim Lockwood and the Mr. T cop are good though. The story is predictable and bland. My advice? Go read the book it was based on instead."
"Stompgal_87","8","1","3","22 April 2014"," One of the most inventive and unique animated films I've ever seen
","I first saw this film at the cinema with a member of support staff at my former care home five years ago and we both enjoyed it a lot. Recently my mother purchased the DVD for me when she got it for a special price with another purchase at HMV and when I watched it this evening, I enjoyed it just as much as I did the first time around.<br/><br/>The animation is consistent for the most part with some good uses of squash and stretch, especially in the Jell-O scene, but it was sometimes rapid and jarring, particularly on Earl towards the end of the film and while the character designs are cartoonish with a few blocky elements (particularly the nose of Flint's father and Earl's hands) and not as realistic as those in the Shrek franchise, the visuals were inventive, the backgrounds were full of vibrancy, especially the enormous Jell-O 'palace' and when the film's setting was covered in ice cream, and detailed. It was funny when a banana 'boomerang' knocked the Columbia lady out of her spot in the opening logo and this is the most creative use of the logo since 'Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle' (in which the camera zooms into the fire of the lady's torch and links to a real fire in the film itself). I also like the use of hybridity. While the majority of the film is 3D computer-animated, I liked the use of the cute dog film to provide a background for a weather summary, the animated photograph of a cat and the 2D special effects plus also the brightly-coloured 2D end-credits sequence if it was jerky in parts. The story is unique and, as other reviewers have said, full of originality due to using the food theme in a way that has never been thought of in animated film before while the dialogue is witty and smart. Some of the funniest moments included Baby Brent's repeated ""Uh-oh!"" line and Flint's monkey Steve (the second animated primate I've heard of with that name, the other one being from childhood favourite 'Spot the Dog') wanting gummy bears and eventually fighting them off during the climax. I did agree with a previous reviewer about Earl's line, ""I love you, son,"" being repetitive but it was really sweet nonetheless. Despite the majority of the voice cast being lesser known, the voice acting is one of the best assets of the film and the cast members I seem the most familiar with are Anna Farris as Sam and 'The A Team's' Mr T as Earl. While the music is not the most memorable feature, I liked the song 'Sunshine, Lollipops and Rainbows' by Lesley Gore as well as Miranda Cosgrove's (who went on to voice Margo in the 'Despicable Me' films) 'Raining Sunshine,' the one playing over the 2D-animated portion of the end credits and the incidental music playing while an allergy-swollen Sam tries to pull up Flint with a Twizzler is beautiful. Both Flint and Sam are worthwhile leads while Earl and his son, the mayor, Baby Brent, Flint's father and Steve all provide great support.<br/><br/>In spite of the animation being slightly inconsistent in places and a couple of repetitive lines, this film really is a feast for the eyes and is without doubt one of the most creative I've ever seen. 8/10."

","Pixar is the undisputed king of the animated. According to tradition, no other studio is even able to hold a candle to the impeccably written/rendered masterpieces the Disney-affiliated atelier continues to churn out year after year. With the critical acclaim Dreamworks' How to Train Your Dragon has recently received, though, the previous is quickly becoming an antiquated notion. Recently, another brilliantly written (and directed) animated feature—which, for some inexplicable reason, somehow managed to drift under the radar of the popular eye—was released and serves as a great example of how the competition is heating up for the hitherto unchallenged Pixar. I present to you Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs.<br/><br/>The story follows a down-and-out inventor named Flint Lockwood. He lives with is dad and is considered ""the local crackpot."" Flint's hometown—which is situated on an island in the middle of the Atlantic— has fallen upon dire financial straits after its chief source of revenue (a sardine canning plant) closed its doors. Flint, however, has come up with a device that he believes will preserve the sanity of his fellow citizens, who, in addition to facing sever monetary problems, have been forced to consume the leftover sardines from the cannery. The nifty little contraption he's created converts water vapor to food. We're talking ice cream, spaghetti, pizza, chips, etc. When Flint attempts to hook his machine up to a more sufficient power source than he's afforded in his lab on stilts, things go haywire, and his food-maker is launched into the stratosphere. Before anyone knows what's happened, hamburgers begin falling from the sky. Flint soon realizes that he can broadcast a signal to his device and control the items it releases. Soon the entrepreneurial spirit of the town's mayor takes over, and greed becomes the order of the day.<br/><br/>I know what you're thinking: this all sounds very familiar. WALL-E tackled similar themes, and it addressed them so beautifully that it seems like Meatballs couldn't possibly be anything more than an afterthought withering in Pixar's massive shadow. Surprisingly, this is very far from the truth. Don't make the mistake of dismissing this as ""more of the same"": it's not. Actually, it's one of the funniest movies I've seen in a long time. I'm saying this as an adult male who typically finds the comedy in animated features strained and flat. Here, I laughed out loud at regular intervals. The humor is subtle, nuanced, and often nothing short of riotous (parodying everything from viral videos to blockbuster action flicks).<br/><br/>I don't think I can heap enough praise on the cleverly constructed story and the superbly timed comedy, so I'll drive my point home by saying that Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs will delight you in the most unexpected ways.<br/><br/>In fact, you should go watch it. Right now."

Beyond that, it's a very charming movie with a top notch cast including Anna Faris, Bruce Campbell, Neil Flynn, Al Roker and Mr. T.

"Benjamin_406","10","1","3","2 May 2010"," FINALLY! A masterpiece that shows Sony Pictures Animation's true identity!
","Since 2006, Sony Pictures Animation had been trying to rank with Pixar and Dreamworks, particularly in storytelling. Its first film, ""Open Season"", wasn't well-received, mostly because it's a ripoff of ""Madagascar"". In 2007, on the other hand, Sony released ""Surf Up"" as the first documentary film in animated feature. That showed the studio's true potential in storytelling. But above all, it's ""Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs"", the first animated disaster film, that shined Sony's true identity the most.<br/><br/>Not only CWACOM has the spirit of the original children's authors, it has managed to stay away from the storytelling styles of Disney, Pixar and Dreamworks, too. The film-making team did an excellent job on replicating stylized animation in CGI (check out the mouth shapes of Flint Lockwood, for instance). Most importantly, its humor is sophisticated and its heart can be apparent (such as Flint Lockwood longing for Tim Lockwood's love).<br/><br/>Now that CWACOM has ranked among the best animated features of 2009 (The Princess and the Frog, Up, Coraline), Sony Pictures Animation should keep up the good work, mostly in its own storytelling style and even its experimentation on stylized animation and genres (such as reality TV show)."

","This film will delight all of any age, fun humour and delightful characters. The effects are not pixel perfect but then again this film is not supposed to be. Definitely either the best or one of the best of Sony Pictures Animation's films. It's a nice laid back film, doesn't have an in depth or full bodied story line as in Pixar films, emotive and the cast do a good job. The plot is simple enough but it's all the small things that make this film brilliant. I would recommend this film for everyone who likes a laugh, connectible characters and a boy and girl who save the world and live happy ever after.

","Apply the incredible advances in three dimensional CGI rendering to a pretty good children?s book and you get?a pretty good movie. CwCM takes the central idea of the kid?s book and tries to inflate it to a full-length feature film by using anti-obesity, pro-environment and worldwide Armageddon themes. The heavy themes and the cacophonous Foley editing quickly becomes a bit much leading to some relief when its 90 minute running time has evaporated. However, like food avalanche that destroys the town/island somewhere in the mess are some tasty nuggets including Mr. T?s voice-over work (although his lines are fairly repetitive) and some clever food-themed riffs. The noise and the funny will help to distract from some truly WTF moments including a cameraman turns out to be a Guatemalan doctor, a former child star who later turns into a cooked chicken and the giant squid-sized eyes on the main characters (I understand that bigger eyes = more cute but only to a certain extent before it become creepy). In summary, wait for it on cable."

","'Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs' was a popular children's book in the 1970's. It has been adapted to the big screen in this animation feature.<br/><br/>Swallow Falls, a small island in the Atlantic has only one thing to boast of: Sardines. With time, exports die out, people get bored of eating sardines all day long and despair settles on the town.<br/><br/>Enter Flint Lockwood, a regular nerd with big dreams in his eyes, who has been trying to invent something useful since his childhood. He finally succeeds, inventing a machine that starts raining food from the sky. What happens after wards forms the crux of the story. The screenplay continues on the innovative theme in the story and bombards us with delectable food items falling from the sky, until greed settles in. How Flint resolves the situation that arises from this is handled pretty funnily.<br/><br/>The visuals of 'Cloudy...' are different, unlike what we normally see in a Pixar movie. The food looks delicious, but that's just about it. The cast, led by Bill Hader and Anna Faris, does a good job. James Caan as Flint's father, and Bruce Campbell as the mayor are excellent.<br/><br/>Final Verdict: 'Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs' is a simple movie, uncomplicated by the regular 'deeper meaning of life' fundas of Pixar. Good for a home viewing."

The stand out from this movie is the story itself, the idea a machine invented by a quirky inventor to produce mass food from the sky is highly imaginative.

","Many accuse me of being a Pixar snob, biased towards the originators of feature-length CG films and dismissive of the works of others. On the face of it, this would appear to be sound. But there are Pixar films that are weaker than others (""Cars 2"" springs instantly to mind) while many studios are catching Pixar up with efforts like ""Despicable Me"" and ""The Lego Movie"". It isn't as cut-and-dry as they might imagine and lo, here was another film I was told would be a challenge to Pixar's previously unimpeachable dominance. While it might be a technical tour de force, it veers wildly from emotive family issues to a kung-fu kicking roast chicken and frankly, there is a lot of stuff that doesn't stick.<br/><br/>In the sleepy Atlantic island haven of Swallow Falls, wannabe inventor Flint Lockwood (Bill Hader) has been testing his latest venture - a machine which can turn water into whatever food is programmed into it. But like his spray-on shoes and rat-bird hybrids, the prototype goes wrong and ends up blasting itself into the upper atmosphere. But to Flint's amazement, it begins raining food which delights the residents and the mayor (Bruce Campbell) in particular, who sees the bizarre climate as an opportunity to relaunch the island as a tourist destination. But Flint isn't happy - his disapproving father (James Caan) wishes Flint would simply work in his fishing tackle shop while Flint's attempts at wooing weather reporter Sam Sparks (Anna Faris) are as disastrous as his inventions. As the greedy residents demand more from Flint's creation, the town is swamped with food falling from the sky and before long, Swallow Falls is in danger of being wiped from the map altogether and only Flint can save the day...<br/><br/>""Cloudy With A Chance Of Meatballs"" may be food-based fun for the little 'uns who love the idea of their house covered with ice-cream and burgers covering their school but where the film disappoints is when it comes to keeping adults entertained. And aside from casting Mr T as a cop, it did little to put a smile on my face. Most of the humour is derived from the madness on screen and to be honest, a lot of it doesn't look great either. Flint is a mass of hair, nose and flowing lab coat while his father is all eyebrow and meat. The whole thing looks like a cartoon which sounds obvious but compared to Pixar's output at the time (""Up"" and before that, ""WALLE""), it looks quite primitive at times. Busy, full of colour and hyper-kinetic certainly but still primitive. The voice casting are also a let down - why do studio insist with flooding the cast of animated films with recognisable stars who never appear on screen and aren't right for the part? Only Campbell and Mr T shine as the rest of them fade into obscurity and to be honest, could have been anybody.<br/><br/>Anyone can make a film that kids would enjoy (although an alarming number still get it wrong). Going to the pictures should be an occasion, seeing as decent family time is increasingly rare these days. The huge screen and volume, the enormous bag of pick-n-mix sweets and the giant Slushee you can dunk your head into - why shouldn't kids be entertained in cinemas? Trouble is, only Pixar seem to be able to create true family entertainment. A good family film will keep the kids quiet for a hour or two but a great one will hold the entire family in the palm of its hand and make you want to watch it together again. ""Cloudy With A Chance Of Meatballs"" isn't that great a movie, offering kids plenty to watch and probably some freaky dreams (I suspect I'll be dreaming about being chased by a giant hot-dog rolling down the street tonight) but next to nothing for the grown-ups. If you want a great family movie that isn't Pixar then feel free to watch Gru in ""Despicable Me"" which still feels like a cartoon but at least Mum & Dad can have a laugh as well.

","Based on the 1978 novel of the same name by Judi and Ron Barrett, directors Phil Lord and Chris Miller took the foundation of the literature and created a sort of 'origin' story. The book told of a fantastical town where it rained the inhabitant's daily meals until the portions span out of control, creating gigantic food storms and oversized grub. The film imagines this phenomena is caused by science- nut Flint Lockwood (Bill Hader), who after witnessing his small town getting shut off from the world and forced to eat nothing but sardines, thinks he can win the hearts of the townsfolk by creating a machine that turns water in the food of your choice.<br/><br/>At the opening of Sardine Land, hosted by Mayor Shelbourne (Bruce Campbell), Flint's contraption goes haywire and shoots off into the sky. Soon enough, pickles, buns and cheese are raining from the sky, which soon become full cheeseburgers. The townsfolk lap it up, plying Flint with requests, and even the intern reporter Sam Sparks (Anna Faris) starts to enjoy her pun-filled reports. That is until the machine starts to lose control and begins spewing out giant spaghetti tornado's and giant steaks.<br/><br/>Similar in a way to the Belgian madcap comedy A Town Called Panic, released the same year, Cloud With a Chance of Meatballs find most of it's charm in its relentless and hyperactive approach. Jokes litter both the foreground and background of the movie, producing some inventive, old-fashioned slapstick alongside some modern, more neurotic humour. It's an insane film at times, but there's a lot of genuine wit here. In a montage of Flint's failed inventions, we see televisions that walk to you on legs so you can change the channel, spray-on shoes that never come off, and ratbirds. The inventions are then seen throughout the film, either taking an active role in the plot or, in the television's case, looting the town's electronics store for an enjoyable throwaway gag.<br/><br/>But beneath all the frenetic energy, there's some heartfelt moments involving Flint's father (voiced by a gruff James Caan) who can't quite communicate with the son he doesn't understand. There is also some subtle commentary on humanity's wastefulness and penchant for greed. All the uneaten food gets flung miles over a hill so it can rot away out of sight, and as the dollar signs increase in size in Mayor Shelbourne's eyes, so does his waste size. The ending takes the disappointing route of continuing the current trend of animated films having overblown, action-packed climaxes, but if you can put that aside, there is a lot to savour here.<br/><br/>www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com"

","Many people had told me that this computer animated film was hilarious, and I had seen a good amount of clips to be convinced to see it, and with the sequel in cinemas it was obvious the original would be shown on TV, so I watched with interest when it was. Basically on the small island of Swallow Falls, a town thats only revenue and nourishment comes from sardines, Flint Lockwood (Bill Hader) is a clumsy inventor, encouraged by his late mother and misunderstood by his father Tim (James Caan), he has always wanted to invent something great, but all his useless or nonsensical attempts have failed. Assisted by his pet monkey Steve (Neil Patrick Harris), his latest invention is a machine that transforms water into food, and after short circuiting the house he decides to hook it up and power it at the nearby power plant, but something goes wrong and it rockets through the town, destroying new tourist attraction Sardine Land before going up into the stratosphere. Acknowledging another failure he meets intern weather reporter Samantha 'Sam' Sparks (Anna Faris) who was to have her big break before he spoilt it, however a rainbow appears in the sky, and all of the sudden it starts to rain cheeseburgers (previously selected in the computer), all of the townspeople are happy to catch and eat these delicious treats from the sky. Flint realises this is not a failure, and the potential his invention, the ""Flint Lockwood Diatonic Super Mutating Dynamic Food Replicator"", or FLDSMDFR for short, and he creates a computer based communicator device to send orders to the machine so it will rain certain foods, and with all these different foods raining in the town Swallow Falls is renamed Chewandswallow and becomes a ""food tourism"" destination, and meanwhile he gets to know Sam more. Over time though the townspeople are becoming more greedy requesting the machine's foods, and the foods are slowly increasing in size, and also it is over- mutating, but now morbidly obese Mayor Shelbourne (Bruce Campbell) guilt trips Flint into continuing to make it rain food, he also causes his father to lose business at Baby Brent Sardine where he works. Soon enough, during an inaugural event, a large tornado, made up of spaghetti, tomato and meatballs, Flint rushes to turn the machine off using a kill code, but the Mayor destroys the communication device, and he ordered a Las Vegas style all-you-can-eat buffet before doing this, so a storm of giant foods threatens the town and the world, but he gets encouragement from his father to solve the problem. Flint builds a flying car, and he, Sam, her cameraman Manny (Benjamin Bratt), Steve and 'Baby' Brent (Andy Samberg) head for the stratosphere to destroy the machine with the kill code on USB flash drive, now in the core of a giant meatball and surrounded by attacking foods for protection. The townspeople try to escape as Mount Leftovers, the mountain of leftover foods from previous rainfalls, as it collapses and spills, and after failing to use the correct document on his cell phone Flint uses his Spray-On Shoes formula and it explodes and the heroes get away, on return Tim finally appreciates his son and his inventions, the obese mayor is left stranded in the ocean on a peanut butter and jelly sandwich boat, and Flint and Sam celebrate the end of the food terror with a kiss. Also starring Mr. T as Earl Devereaux and Bobb'e J. Thompson as Cal Devereaux. The voices are all right for the characters, Hader being the incompetent but lovable geek, Faris being her usual silly but infatuating personality, Campbell being mean, and the instantly recognisable Mr. T as a cop, the special effects to create tasty looking cheeseburgers, a bouncy orange castle of jelly, a snowfall of ice cream and all colourful things to see are fantastic, and there certainly are many slapstick moments that will make adults and children alike laugh lots, a really fun animated comedy fantasy.

","To understand this film ask this question: who is the protagonist and who is the antagonist? The answer is surprising: the person you might imagine to be the bad guy — Flint Lockwood, who almost destroys the world — is actually the protagonist. And the antagonist is actually the Mayor. We are groomed from the beginning to root for Flint and to dislike the Mayor — Flint has a back-story and we first meet him as a wide-eyed child who is bullied by his peers. Unlike Flint, the Mayor has no back story — I didn't even know that he had a name until I saw it here.<br/><br/>Flint = good; Mayor = bad. Everything unfolds from this.<br/><br/>Who is Flint Lockwood? He is a dreamer and an inventor. He is a bit nerdy, a bit misguided, but always well-intentioned. And he does something of great significance: he invents a machine that causes it to rain food, thereby revitalizing the economy of a town that was dying and creating access to a resource that was quite limited (previously, the townspeople lived off of sardines). Food, of course, provides people with energy — Flint is an energy provider.<br/><br/>However, Flint's method of resource extraction produces some troubling results. The amount of waste produced is staggering and it piles up on the horizon and threatens to tumble down upon the town. The mass production of this resource also results in an environmental disaster, which threatens to destroy the entire planet.<br/><br/>Does this story sound familiar to anybody? It should. Flint isn't just any energy provider, he's Big Oil.<br/><br/>Who, then, is the Mayor? Let's look at the way he speaks of himself in a candid moment: ""This hellhole is too small for me, Brent. I wanna be big. I want people to look at me and say, ""That is one big mayor."" Otherwise, I'm just a tiny mayor of a tiny town full of tiny sardine-sucking knuckle-scrapers."" Of course, the mayor very quickly does become very big and transforms from being small and slender to being massively obese.<br/><br/>So the oil company is the good guy and the Mayor is the bad guy and the bad guy wants to be big the antagonist in this film is big government. The problems arise because the government wants to exploit the good-hearted but somewhat naive energy producer in order to gain wealth and status. Flint just wants to make everybody's lives better — the Mayor wants to be big. Because of this the Mayor pushes Flint to do things he would not do otherwise, and he stops Flint from pulling the plug when Flint tries to do that. Then, when disaster strikes, the Mayor abandons the town to try and escapes at the expense of others. Big government is not your friend.<br/><br/>But there is another enemy lurking here, somebody else who is to blame for all of this. Who is this hidden enemy driving the world to the brink of destruction? You. If you weren't demanding that the energy provider continually flood the market with more, everything would have been fine. The energy provider was only trying to make you happy. Unlike the Mayor, Flint was never motivated by a desire for wealth or power. He wanted to be loved by others and maybe that blinded him a little, but that's true of everybody.<br/><br/>All of this is beautifully explained in a speech that the police officer, Earl, makes to the townspeople when they are intent on lynching Flint because they blame him for the disaster. Earl intervenes and says: ""This mess we're in is all our faults. Me, I didn't even protect my own son. Look, I'm as mad at Flint as you are. In fact, when he gets out of that car, I'm gonna slap him in the face. I know Flint Lockwood made the food, but it was made-to-order. And now it's time for all of us to pay the bill."" So, you see, BP, Keystone XL, Imperial Oil, none of them are to blame for any of this mess. We are. If the oil companies are guilty of anything it's of trying too hard to make us happy.<br/><br/>Notice, also, that it is a police officer making this speech. Earl is the representative of the Law, and the Law vindicates Flint. Flint may deserve a slap but even that is barely enacted, and Earl quickly apologizes to Flint for slapping him (Flint responds by saying, ""That's okay""). So, really, the law punishes the energy provider more to placate the people than to serve justice (and, of course, out of love for the people, the energy provider goes along with it).<br/><br/>Not only does the law vindicate Flint but it is right to do so — for Flint is the one who ends up saving everybody. How does he do this? With further technological advances. He invents a flying car that permits him to gain access to the machine in the sky so that he can put a stop to things.<br/><br/>Of course, flying cars are the symbol of a future when technology has produced a wonderful world for us wherein anything is possible and all our problems have been solved. The solution, then, is not to abandon any of our technological advances but to trust in technology to miraculously save us from an impending disaster that appears to be unavoidable and catastrophic. Another familiar story — the oil companies have been saying the same thing to us for years about climate change.<br/><br/>All told, the message here is this: any environmental catastrophe we are experiencing was produced by self-serving politicians and greedy consumers exploiting well-intentioned energy providers. The solution, then, is to not cast stones, except at big government, and wait for the oil companies to save us, just like Flint saves the townspeople in the film."

","Cloudy With A Chance Of Meatballs was a book I owned when I was younger, and those of you who are older adults probably recognize it as well. The book was a simple picture book and trying to get a movie out of seemed... well... hard. But somehow the makers of this movie figured it out. They actually created an entire movie out of a simple picture book... though that's not to say that there weren't some dramatic changes.<br/><br/>The only thing that is the same between the book and the movie is the premise. It rains food. That's it. The atmosphere of the movie is very quirky and light-hearted. It doesn't take itself seriously at all which was a smart decision. From the very beginning the movie purposely establishes how absurd the movie is going to be. The jokes are relatively good though keep in mind this movie is aimed more towards kids and there aren't any hidden jokes or anything to keep older audiences really amused.<br/><br/>The animation is very bright and flashy and is pretty good. It's not going to be remember for outstanding animation but that's only a minor detail. The downside with the movie is that it feels more like a giant joke in itself. Since the movie isn't taking itself seriously that means it isn't being serious about telling a story that is bigger than joke. The final action sequence is visual gag after visual gag and pretty much is just a set up for jokes. It's funny but it makes the movie feel more like a roller coaster of jokes and excitement instead of being anything more than just ""entertainment"".<br/><br/>To sum it up, Cloudy With A Chance Of Meatballs is an entertaining movie and children will probably find the characters funny (particularly the talking monkey) however the movie isn't really memorable and doesn't stand out as a big achievement in film making.

And for me, it forebodes that the next 90 minutes won't be bland, cheesy schmaltz that's all the rage in animated films nowadays, both CGI and non-CGI. It predicts a movie which will be fairly witty, which, despite being nothing new in animated films, is a far more refreshing approach than the company's earlier films Open Season and Monster House.<br/><br/>Flint Lockwood (Bill Hader), is a young mad scientist who lives in a small island, famous for its sardines and lack of any other food, which makes a bit of money off tourism. Flint is aching to invent some sort of scientific breakthrough that will save his town. He manages to create a machine that converts water into food, but once he accidentally flies the machine into the sky, it begins sucking water from the clouds and produces... well, raining cheeseburgers. From then on, Flint becomes a sensation is his town (thanks to the greedy town mayor, voiced by Bruce Campbell), but cracks begin to show when the food starts getting bigger...<br/><br/>Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs turns out to be not only witty, but also intelligent and self-aware, and at times rather touching. There are some predictable jokes and degrading factors (like the pet monkey Steve, who has no purpose to the film other than standing around and being cute), but on the whole the jokes are very well thought out and cleverly executed, and the characters mostly come off as likable too. There are some nice choices for the voice actors (Mr. T has a refreshing turn as the over-the-top police officer and Bruce Campbell is amusing as the horrid mayor), and the characters themselves are pretty likable too.<br/><br/>The animation is great; the huge food really does look good enough to eat; they really do get all the textures right. It's impossible to leave the film without your mouth watering. Anyone who has just finished eating a full all-you-can-eat buffet I'd advise not to watch. Chances are you'll either vomit or force yourself to eat more... and then vomit.<br/><br/>The voice acting is very good too. There are some nice choices (Mr. T has a refreshing turn as the over-the-top police officer and Bruce Campbell is amusing as the horrid mayor), and each actor gives a full amount of enthusiasm and effort into the voices of their characters.<br/><br/>Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs is a very entertaining animated film which, in my opinion, has enough charm and clever jokes to be one of the best animated films of 2009 (probably second to Up). It's not quite up there with Pixar, but it definitely beats most DreamWorks animated films. I'm astonished it wasn't even nominated for an Oscar."

It is also the story of his fellow-citizens in a town surviving on the herring industry, and the story of Sam, a weather woman turned into a reported by accident.<br/><br/>What I liked most is the script, which is very original and crazy. Despite being so, the movie script is well presented, developed and resolved; still, the script might be difficult for small children, but the visual imagination of the film is overflowing and will captivate them anyway. What interested me most in the film was just the food theme, how food abundance is depicted with its good and bad consequences.<br/><br/>The film lacks of intelligent adult humor, the animation style is somewhat ""chunky"" and unrefined (a retro look or a more contemporary one would have suited the story better) and it is not engaging enough in general. <br/><br/>Is a good and enjoyable movie of the whole family."
"barnabyrudge","6","0","1","11 June 2010"," Generally a fun film, with a refreshingly original plot.
","The most impressive thing about Cloudy With A Chance Of Meatballs is that its plot is refreshingly original. Hollywood cartoons of late have been predictable, bland and boringly alike. It has been left to others – most significantly the Japanese – to produce animated movies with any kind of vision or innovation about them. So, it comes as a huge relief that Cloudy With A Chance Of Meatballs manages to tell a new, wacky, totally off-kilter story with a fair degree of verve. The film still has some weaknesses – hence the score of 6 – but at least the storyline is not one of them.<br/><br/>Eccentric child Flint (voice of Bill Hader) wants more than anything to be a great inventor, even though most of his projects end in disaster. His father Tim (voice of James Caan) is a more practical, down-to-earth type who thinks his son should stop dreaming of wacky inventions and get a proper job. Tim arranges for Flint to start working in his fishing tackle store, but Flint still harbours dreams of building a revolutionary machine that can create food by converting water molecules into edible products. Flint builds his machine, but a freak accident results in it being launched into the clouds. Pretty soon it is reacting with the moisture in the clouds, causing crazy storms in which food falls from the sky rather than raindrops. To begin with, everyone finds these culinary storms funky and exciting, but soon bigger and bigger objects are falling from the heavens. Steaks that crush houses, burgers that flatten towns – Flint realises that his food-creating machine is out of control, creating pieces of food so big they could soon destroy the world! Aided by pretty journalist Sam Sparks (voice of Anna Faris), Flint races to save the planet from the massive food storms that jeopardise the future of human existence.<br/><br/>First of all, what do I like about this movie? Already I've said quite a lot about the inventive plot. Besides that the voice acting is generally entertaining, with particular kudos going to James Caan and Mr. T, both of whom create memorably eccentric and funny characters. The animation is pretty dazzling too, with vibrant colours and effects.. What don't I like about the film? Perhaps the biggest let-down is that in the end the film falls back onto the disappointingly conventional and sentimental theme of father-son bonding. After all the imagination and invention that has gone into the story, it seems a shame that the makers then bring their resolution down to yet another example of cinematic moralising, as the dysfunctional father and son ""find"" each other. Also, the film's climax goes on and on and on, rather out-staying its welcome and resulting in a sense of overkill. On the whole though Cloudy With A Chance Of Meatballs is a fun film, definitely above average and definitely worth watching if only to admire its originality. It's just a shame it succumbs to preachy moralising at the end."
"andro-dolic","6","0","2","14 April 2010"," This movie is very strange
","Very strange movie because of its whole plot and it is unusual for animated movies . There are some moments which are very good and entertaining with very good visual effects . There are also parts when you can learn something . It is very nice but sometimes it is very weird and I don't is this kind of animated movies are unusual . Plot is a bit strangers and whole fable is sometimes very boring or better to say strange . I can find point of this movie and it is really nice . You can't find yourself such easily in this movie . It is not so good but I like it because of its funny and very inventive details and whole plot . It is very good movie for someone who is real lover of animated movies . I still can't find something very entertaining in this movie to make it better because I didn't watch this movie in 3D but I was trying to think like I watched and there are many visual excitements so I hope that many of people who watched it had fun with this visual excitements . I am recommending it but I can't that it is one of the best ."
"TxMike","Null","0","2","8 February 2010"," Superb animation and voice acting, but something disturbed me about this movie.
","What's not to like, with such nice voice actors as Bill Hader, Anna Faris, James Caan, Bruce Campbell, Mr. T, Lauren Graham, and Al Roker? Did I just type ""Al Roker"", personality from NBC's Morning Show? Yes indeed.<br/><br/>The animation is superb. The voice acting is superb. But the story? I suppose it strikes a chord with kids. But some some reason I found it disturbing.<br/><br/>There is a small island, located on the map right under the ""A"" in Atlantic. Their fame is sardines. But the world is getting tired of sardines, as are the residents of this small island.<br/><br/>Bill Hader is Flint Lockwood, who from a very young age decided that he was special, and that he could invent great things. But it never happened. Rats with wings were, and still are, a disaster. His remote control TV had legs, so it could come to the viewer to let him to change channels.<br/><br/>James Caan is Tim Lockwood, Flint's dad. He runs a bait and tackle shop and he just wants Flint to give up his folly and join him in the business as dad and son.<br/><br/>But one day when Anna Faris as Sam Sparks, cub reporter is dispatched to their small island as a fill-in weather person, Flint's invention takes off, literally. It is a machine that can turn plain old water (or water vapor!) into any kind of food. Dial in the food, and soon it is raining ... cheeseburgers. Later pizza, or eggs and bacon, or whatever it is programmed.<br/><br/>Soon the little island is celebrating its rebirth, and plan a big new opening where tourists can come and participate in the raining of food. And that is where the title originates, on the final day of this story it is cloudy, and soon begins to rain giant meatballs and giant spaghetti.<br/><br/>A movie of this sort wouldn't be complete without a love interest, and Flint and Sam provide that. From an adult perspective, it is a silly movie with a few good, genuine laughs. From a kid's perspective, it is probably really fun."

","I've been always impressed how animated films spent their bucks and efforts having those fingertips work and mind squeezed with ideas that would induce viewers to new level of sensation. Since I saw recently Up, Kung Fu Panda, Ratatouille, Wall-E and Bolt, I got fascinated how animated films nowadays revolutionize compared to early ones (such us Finding Nemo, A Bugs Life, Shark's Tale and more). Films such as these are at the outset, being fit for anyone of any age. Too much with the intro the film is full of creativity. However I guess the original creativity wasn't materialized with such extent when it was materialized into an animated film. The storyline was thin, easily understandable but the characters were somewhat fascinatingly mediocre. I don't find it absolutely amusing how the characters developed and interact with each one. Take the case of Lock Flintwood with other characters such as the police guy, the weather girl and his father. It seems his existence is a joke, but I guess anyone watching this wouldn't feel that deeply because the film in the first place is meant to be like this. At any rate probably my mood wasn't at full scale to appreciate the film well. Nevertheless their creativity was fun and considerably ingenious. You got to see giant pancakes whalloping the whole school topped with butter and drizzled with syrup. The characters also just funnily, whimsically or unimaginably coast through the scene with less regard to how they actually did it. Like Flintwood for example, hopping and flying unscathed when he got sucked in the spaghetti whirlwind. But you wouldn't bother anyway how he did that, because this is in the first place an animated film not meant to crush reality just to flaunt entertainment. But I guess the film fails to clearly deliver its inner layer of lessons and values (to children specially) even to adults (because the rest of the film, I believe disinterests them to appreciate what the film is all about, you get amused by the food, the characters' odd characters). The bottom line its totally ordinary fun."
