"TheKing87","10","1238","1731","17 March 2018"," Many people misunderstood this movie! There is a twist in the story!
","I was very skeptical about this movie from the very beginning, because I thought that this would probably be a dumb monster movie with a similar theme like ""Beauty and the Beast"". However, I was very surprised when I saw the movie and think that it was brilliant!<br/><br/>After reading the reviews on this site, it is my understanding that many people that saw this move completely misunderstood it, both the people that loved it and the ones who hated it. <br/><br/>The theme of the movie is not something similar to Beauty and the Beast for those who might think that! <br/><br/>There are several themes in this movie, but the overall theme is about minorities and how privileged people view those who are different. However to make this message more clear the movie is set in the 1960's, where minorities were generally marginalized. <br/><br/>The lead character Elisa Esposito is a mute woman, who was an orphaned child that was found in a river with wounds on her neck and communicates through sign language. She works in a government laboratory as a cleaning lady. Her friends are her co-worker Zelda, a black woman who serves as an interpreter for Elisa, and her next-door neighbor Giles, a closeted gay man. Elisa discovers a mysterious creature in the facility and begins to bond with it. The creature is a mute humanoid amphibian that was captured in a river in South America by Strickland, who is in charge of the project to study it.<br/><br/>Elisa is the main protagonist in this story, and together with Zelda and Giles, they represent a social minority. Women, handicapped people, black people and gay people are all amongst those that were outcast by society at the time. On the other hand, there is Strickland who is the main antagonist in the story and he represents the privileged people at the time. He is a white man in a privileged position, married with children, religious, and is hostile to those who are not like him. He treats the creature hostilely, beats and abuses it, and calls it a monster.<br/><br/>When Elisa learns that Strickland plans to vivisect the creature, she hatches a plan with the help of her friends to free the creature and keeping it in a bathtub at her apartment and planning to set it free in the ocean. Elisa and the creature bond romantically and it is revealed that the creature has healing powers.<br/><br/>When the day arrives to set the creature free, Strickland arrives and shoots Elisa and the creature. The creature heals itself and kills Strickland. The creature takes Elisa and jumps into the ocean where it heals her. When the creature applies his healing touch to the scars on her neck, she starts to breathe through gills.<br/><br/>Here is the TWIST: This scene reveals that Elisa was of the same kind as the creature all along. She just had a more human like form than the creature. There are different clues throughout the film. She was found as child next to a river like the creature. She was found with the ""scars"" on her neck and they turned out to be dormant gills as the creature healed her. She was mute like the creature. She loved being in water as shown in her morning habits. She was initially attracted to the creature whereas most people would fear it. She comes from a Spanish speaking country, as her last name is Spanish whereas the creature was found in a river in South America.<br/><br/>The creature itself and Elisa represent a minority, as they are alike. The fact that the creature is different yet human like, symbolizes how privileged people viewed minorities at the time. The point of the monster is simply to symbolize how we sometimes view other people that are different from us.<br/><br/>The message of the story is this: You view other people that are different from yourself as ""monsters"" if you don't try to understand them. However, if you try to understand people who are different from yourself, then you will see that we are basically all alike even though we look different.<br/><br/>I think this movie was brilliant and very clever. Guillermo Del Toro did a great job. It is definitely a movie worth watching.<br/><br/>This is my point of view and I hope that you found this helpful."
"malcolja","2","922","1546","1 January 2018"," Guillermo Del Toro does ""Amelie"" meets ""Creature from the Black Lagoon""
","Diabetics beware, you're in for a saccharine flavoured heap of mush.<br/><br/>The Shape of Water was directed/created by Guillermo Del Toro best known for creepy and violent films such as Pan's Labyrinth and more mainstream writings such as Hellboy and The Hobbit. For some reason he has had a dose of the lovestrucks and written a film that is basically Amelie meets Creature from the Black Lagoon. There are a couple of questionable violent scenes (torturing a dying man by dragging him around via a bullet wound to the cheek had a touch of the old GDT that we know and love) but the plot literally has no surprises whatsoever. I picked the minor twist about 10 minutes in, and spent the second half of the film waiting for it to be over. <br/><br/>I am sorry to say the only interesting part was the reveal (not literally) of the sea creature's penis via the main character's description which is frankly hilarious. <br/><br/>Octavia Spencer does a fantastic job of playing herself (Was this woman born middle aged?) but let's face it we love her anyway. I would love her to be my best friend, she's a hoot.<br/><br/>Michael Shannon (whom I remember from Take Shelter and Boardwalk Empire) plays a creepy bad guy in a way that makes me never want to have him around for Christmas lunch. Why does he always play someone sexually awkward? I pray we'll never find out. <br/><br/>I was most disappointed that unlike Pan's Labyrinth and some of the other films GDT has made it's not set in a fantastical different world. It's basically the 1950s cold war era in USA with no real pretense of being anything but. I was hoping for a magical realism, but other than the creature, there's no otherworldliness to it. <br/><br/>I am a solid romantic, but I found the plot so saccharine that it made me feel nauseous. There is also a sudden musical number that almost had me running for the aisle, and my sister desperate to see my husband's face (He's allergic to musicals generally). Apart from this light relief, I couldn't wait to get out of there.<br/><br/>I am pretty alone in this opinion, our party was split between 3 people who loved it, and my husband and I who hated it. Maybe if I hadn't seen other GDT films I would have liked it more. My husband also thought the trailer completely misrepresented what he expected from the film. So maybe we were in the wrong movie. But I think romance lovers won't like the art house element, and art house/GDT fans won't like this film. So I think commercially it will be hard to place."
"bigsmiles-28464","1","1055","1785","2 January 2018"," So disappointing.
","I was taught before criticism that you should first bring up the good points. Good points: Cinematography, good actors, great old movie clips and music, great sets, good costumes, and an extremely promising storyline. Unfortunately, this movie missed, when it really could have, and SHOULD have, hit. 
I think from now on I'll choose my movies based upon how they're doing at the box office, and not based on reviews. It seems to be a better indicator of what the public REALLY thinks about a film. 
We're at week 3 and (for such a seemingly magnificent film), The Shape of Water hasn't even broken even. A telling clue. Budget:$19,400,000 (estimated)
Opening Weekend USA: $166,564, 3 December 2017, Limited Release
Gross USA: $12,140,155, 28 December 2017<br/><br/>Personally, I found it contrived, unbelievable, and just plain stupid. Where to start? 
A cookie cutter ""Beauty and the Beast"" love story with too many holes. I never caught on to the burgeoning romance. Somehow it just fell flat for me. It was already a mediocre movie when they did that ridiculous black & white dance sequence, which was so far out of place, I lost all interest. The music and old film clips were great, but what were they thinking? Were they trying to cash in on some La La Land success? Or was it supposed be some allusion to Cinderella's ball? It would have made more sense as a dream sequence either where Hawkins had dozed off during a flick, or in the bathtub. 
Ew. Were the masturbation scenes really necessary? I can't see where they drove the plot. 
Are we supposed to believe a creature like that could or would run into a theatre, leaving a blood trail no less, without being seen by ANYONE? Then he just stands watching a film. (All the while knowing he was in danger from humans and he needed to get to water)? All this, and the projectionist doesn't notice? Where are the film patrons? How'd he get IN without being noticed by anyone? An unlocked door? What would be the purpose of having a box office if you're going to leave an access door unlocked? 
Are we supposed to believe that the creature, being so sick and weak that he must be released immediately, suddenly has superhuman strength after some strange (and inexplicable) resurrection event following his ""death""? 
And are we supposed to believe that you could pull a full grown man via a bullet hole in his cheek? (You'd rip right through.)
Are we supposed to believe that the best friend wouldn't have freaked out about the coitus? In her eyes, wasn't it more an animal. At the very least, one would expect her to broach the subject of pregnancy. 
How did those two remain standing in the bathroom? The force of the water would have carried them out. If it was pressing that much on the door, the window should have blown. 
Why didn't Richard Jenkins appear to grieve at all regarding his cat?
And why? Oh WHY? Couldn't they just release him directly into the ocean immediately, rather than wait for the locks to fill. I mean the water was RIGHT THERE. They could have made a bath in the back of the van, and just got him to the coast. 
On and on I could go, but I'm done with my rant. <br/><br/>Save your money. If you want dumbed down fantasy get the Hallmark channel. At least you know you're getting purely pleasant drivel, instead of wasting your money and being grossly disappointed."

","So determined is Del Toro to keep his happy ending that he forces the film into a narrative structure that is both cliched and unimaginative. The 1960s setting might have served for an interesting back drop for Del Toro to explore social issues, but it's script is so on the nose, his characters so dull and formulaic, that it waters down any meaningful message."
"crazymanmichael","1","108","179","12 July 2019"," The Shape of Garbage
","I was prepared to like this film. Hell, I WANTED to like it, seriously. Based on his previous work, I thought Del Toro a filmmaker with some chops (although now I'm not so sure...) and really, I had some expectations for this newest piece of his.<br/><br/>It started well: the sets had this kind of baroque, Gilliam-esque density and muted palette that gave the film a certain visual appeal and tone. Twenty minutes in I was thinking, ""Okay... it's not as good as I hoped, but maybe it'll pull itself together..."" By the end of the first hour I was wondering if I could make it to the finish without hurling something at the screen. But the thing is, I always hold out this forlorn hope that somehow, against all odds, at the finale the movie will redeem itself, explain away the vacuous plot holes, hackneyed acting and ridiculous, cliché ridden dialog, and make SOME kind of sense. Sadly, this was not to be the case. This film was awful right through to the credits.<br/><br/>I really would like to have a conversation with someone who adored this film. I would like to ask them how they managed to get past all of the elements in this film that annoyed and, quite frankly, insulted me as a viewer: the stock, cliched characters, the utterly egregious plot holes, the cringe-worthy dialog (""You ARE a god!"" Eek.), and the fact that our central character, a guy in a rubber fish suit, looked to me exactly like... a guy in a rubber fish suit. For pity's sake, it wasn't even consistent from scene to scene! Did they LOSE some pieces of the suit during filming?? Hell, you could even SEE the seams in some shots!<br/><br/>Okay, just for fun (sarcasm alert) let's look at a couple the more obvious plot holes:<br/><br/>So, apparently we can't release fish-guy back into the ocean because the flood gate at the end of the canal is closed. Explain to me: what's the problem with driving an extra 400 yards to the other side of the gate? Do you seriously expect me to believe that this canal is the ONLY access to the ocean within driving distance? Come ON...<br/><br/>After the great escape (though machinations so absurdly improbable I'm not even going to dignify them with a comment), our well-intentioned heroine decides to keep fish-guy happy (oh, and have sex, too, apparently. Right...) by flooding her entire bathroom with water Does anyone seriously believe that the upper floor of an old building like that could even come CLOSE to handling that kind of mass without a catastrophic structural failure? I'm sorry, but that is simply impossible. Period. Assuming the room is about 10 by 10 (likely bigger), that comes to nearly 50 thousand pounds of water, or 25 tons. In reality, it wouldn't just leak down into the audience below; the entire room, water, floor, walls, bathroom fixtures and everything else, would come crashing down onto the moviegoers, killing or injuring at least a dozen. But that wouldn't make for a charming, romantic movie, would it?<br/><br/>I expect some people are reading the above and thinking, ""Oh come on! It's a fantasy; stop being so literal."" Nope. Sorry, I disagree. If you place a fantasy in a fantasy world then fine, you can write your own rules, create your own reality, the sky's the limit. But if you place your fantasy in the REAL WORLD, then you have to abide by real-world rules. You can't pick and choose what parts of reality to accept and what to cast aside because it's inconvenient. To do so just lazy writing, and this film is rife with it.<br/><br/>I could go on, but really, what's the point? And frankly, I would very much like to put this horrible experience behind me, thank you very much. I have to admit that Sally Hawkins (as Elisa, the mute cleaning lady lead) did a decent job with a shallowly written character. Also, the ubiquitous permeation of cold war paranoia in the 60's was decently captured. But I fail to see how Richard Jenkins, a character actor I admire, could allow himself to be drawn into this mess, especially given his cliched, stock character of the lonely, closeted gay man (if you're going to insert an LGBTQ character into a film, could you not at least make him/her interesting?)<br/><br/>Suffice to say, I have not had any respect for the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences since the execrable ""Oliver!"" won best picture way back in 1968. This film and its woefully misplaced accolades does nothing to change that opinion."
"adamk-2","2","595","1069","14 October 2017"," Disappointing Twaddle
","This has absolutely so much going for it - beautifully filmed, with a magnificent, sweeping score and a stunning performance from Sally Hawkins - but crashes and burns in sentiment, cliché and cartoon supporting acts. It comes across, ultimately, as a cack-handed mash up of ""E.T."", ""Splash"" and ""The Creature From the Black Lagoon"", as an aquatic man is captured and brought into a secret military American laboratory in the 1960s at the height of the cold war, and Sally Hawkins' mute cleaner develops a bond with it and, ultimately, falls in love.<br/><br/>Sounds interesting, doesn't it? It certainly has potential, but if the sassy black friend, constantly yammering on about her feckless husband (Octavia Spencer, surely tiring of this kind of role) doesn't get you, or the inefficient gay neighbour/best friend (Richard Jenkins - not his finest two hours) or Michael Shannon's cartoonish, 2D villain, then stay tuned for the ghastly black-and-white fantasy dance number, in which Hawkins and the creature cavort on an elaborate set like Astaire and Rogers. It truly is a ghastly mis-step, jaw-droppingly stupid. The film never really recovered for me, and it lumbered to its predictable climax and ending with numbing melodramatics and sentiment."

","While the basic premise of this King Kong-ish plot, the lead acting (with the exception of the stereotypical and WAY overplayed villain), and the recreation of the 60's time period are all somewhat worthy (three stars worth), there are many oddly-forced and clunky scenes all of which impede the storytelling flow and represent a serious distraction: Gratuitous gore (rotting fingers, headless kitty), homosexual innuendo, masturbation, a bathroom that will hold 7 feet of water by simply closing the door and putting a towel under it, inter-species love at first sight sexual attraction and off-screen consummation, and a Saturday-Night-Live-like song and dance skit (?), among several others. <br/><br/>Even with the love-conquers-all 'happy ending' and a beautifully depicted submerged in water embrace final scene,' overall it doesn't digest well.<br/><br/>P.S.

","As the director of the highest class, Guillermo del Toro showed himself at the beginning of his career when he happened to put a charming Chronos and truly frightening ""Mutants"", which allowed the Mexican master to gain a foothold on American soil and continue further creative research. Each film del Toro, whether it be frightening mysticism, horror or screen adaptation of a graphic novella, has a powerful emotional charge, profound reasoning and breaking any barriers by the power of love, to which the director has a special relationship. Invariably putting his hand to writing the script, the director does everything necessary for the veil of special effects to reveal the true feelings between intelligent creatures who understand the true value of relations between loved ones. For del Toro, it is not important what kind of love grows in his paintings. It can permeate the relationship of a man and a woman, or vice versa, have a strong kinship. Value has only a manifestation of its essence in all sensual beauty. And then even the most impenetrable gloom retreats to the side, leaving only light on the review, which it is not possible to overcome other feelings. ""Hellboy"", ""Labyrinth of the Faun"", ""Crimson Peak"" and other author's achievements del Toro always attracted special attention from the audience. When the director could bypass the intrusive attention of producers, a truly unforgettable show comes from under his hands. The same is the ""Form of water"", a rich, catchy and at the same time delicate work that keeps us in suspense until the very end.<br/><br/>So, the plot of the film unfolds in the early 60s of the last century and introduces us to the silent cleaning lady Eliza Ezpozito (Sally Hawkins), who managed to get a job in a secret government laboratory. Having found herself far from the city noise and a society that she can not accept the way she is, Sally is sitting out at work all day long and tries to do everything necessary to avoid paying too much attention to her. And let the work with the mop and buckets do not bring her special pleasure, the heroine finds time to delve into her own thoughts and create in the imagination a wonderful world in which no one else can penetrate her. Having no close friends, much less a lover, Eliza tries to look for joy in sheer little things and for a long time nothing foreshadowed the rapid development in her personal relationships, when suddenly the girl seems to know the most important secret around which the secret laboratory's activities are built. It turns out that under the care of the sinister Colonel Strickland (Michael Shannon) is a sensible amphibian (Doug Jones), an unknown creature trapped in a closed reservoir and amenable to constant experiments. Accidentally meeting with the marvelous creature with a glance, Eliza suddenly realizes that this meeting is far from accidental and it is quite possible that a feeling arises between it and the amphibian, which can not be designated otherwise than love. And when it becomes known that the underwater guest faces a deadly danger, Eliza will not sit aside, since for the first time in her life she has found a soul mate and is ready to sacrifice everything for the sake of her salvation.
""The shape of the water"", undoubtedly, stands out with special importance against the background of the other works of Del Toro, since it was born at the moment when its creator had already visited the peak of universal adoration, and then dabbed the reputation with ambiguous projects and decisions that called doubts. But for all his creative mistakes Del Toro not only did not lower his hands, but became only a more perspicacious and skilful creator, who with each new work is put more inspired and restless. Seeing us in the world of brutal servicemen, unfortunate cleaners and innocent magical creatures, the master used the motifs of classical drama and tragedy, surprised with serious emotional strokes and was not afraid to demonstrate strong feelings with all the staging power that not only amazes but also frightens, Like a real horror film. And in order for all the elements of the ""Formula of Water"" to converge, Del Toro needed exceptional actors, able to revive his characters and create experiences that would not have to be doubted. Fortunately, his idea interested only in respectable performers who could easily abandon a large fee in favor of serving the arts.<br/><br/>Sally Hawkins, the confident and sought-after actress, who rarely trusts roles in big blockbusters, of course, became the soul of this film, but her talent and ability to get used to the images gradually becomes legendary. Agreeing to embody Del Toro's fantasies in life, Hawkins played a strikingly sensual role that attracts maximum attention and makes her soul sympathize with the tragedy of the unhappy girl's relationship with a creature from a different world. In turn, a good friend of the director, Doug Jones, was no less brilliant party to match Hawkins, and thereby allowed the actress to reveal the full range of dramatic experiences through the impeccable performance of the image of an amphibian man who caused in a dumb beauty a storm of unprecedented emotions for her. For obvious reasons, we again do not see the true appearance of Jones, but he has repeatedly performed in front of the camera a variety of strange creatures and in the ""Formula of Water"" reached the apogee of skill, after which it will be difficult for him to play a piercing role.<br/><br/>In the end, I want to say that the ""Form of Water"" tells us a love story that is simple and yet unprecedentedly beautiful and soulful. Guillermo del Toro shot the film the way he himself wanted and thanks to this ""Form of Water"" looks like a really chic authoring film."

","I have seen tons of crap movies, believe me, but none of them is bad enough to make me register an account on IMDB just to write a review. But after watching this, I have the urge to express my utterly disgust. Thank you, Del Toro, for that, by the way.<br/><br/>The movie is simply stupid. The storyline is deeply flawed. The only thing the movie challenges the audience is our intelligence. Well i do not expect a Hitchcock movie, we can accept flaws here and there as long as it does not affect the story and fits the characters. But the movie is self contradicting and the characters behaviors are so bizarre it is just so intelligently insulting. So a cleaning lady can steal the ""most valuable asset"" from the ""top secret facility"" which is only guarded by on single soldier and does not even have a moving vehicle to chase after the invaders. They can just park the van downstairs for three or four days and no one thinks about looking for the van. Actually there is no one looking into this at all. From beginning to the end there is only the bad villain alone who is not doing anything but stay in the office and interrogate the cleaning ladies, only after 48 hours he thought about talk to the doctor who refused to kill the monster in the first place. Is this US military? It's easier than rob a bank. If i were Elisa, I'll go rob the Fed. But Elisa is not so smart, she made up the entire plan without thinking about how to unchain the fish dude without a key. And please what is the point of keeping the weaking, dying fish dude in ur home? Waiting to be discovered? Come on, Baltimore is by the sea!! There is literally a dock in the city center. Okay so you want to have sex with him, can you please do it at the back of the van on the way to Mexico? And the police ( ya, still no sign of military) showed up when the government officer died and they watched the suspect left? On and on i could go but i think you get the point.<br/><br/>Let's look at the characters, as a ""romantic love"" story, you did not explain to me how the lady fell in love with the fish dude? Are you telling me because she's a minority, and ""he"" is a minority, so the director thinks it needs no further explanation for her to fell in love with the fish? How did she overcome the fear of his monster looking? How did he understand her? Or it's just her sick, petty love makes her thinks he understands and loves her? There are many ways to show and build up the emotions but the director shows none at all! And is it just me that find it super weird that the lady did not show any form of gratitude, not even an attitude, to her friend at all? It's just so inhuman and fake.<br/><br/>The dialogue is also a disaster.Choppy and facetious, they tried to say something sounds smart and deep but actually just irrelevant and award. Like the ""universe"" thing coming from the general, what is that about? And there are so many random scenes that just make me question the ability of the director. What's the point of showing the doc realising the russian agents are plotting against him when in the end he stills shows up like there's nothing wrong??? Who cares about the villian buying a car from a random salesman(who seems to be the only smart man in the show) and not like talking when banging his wife? What is the point of all this?<br/><br/>As for the cinematography, esthetics effect, etc, there is nothing to talk about. I don't find it ""touching"" or ""romantic"" in any single way. The costume on the fish dude looks like just some random monster from a superhero movie, not even the carefully designed big boss, but those minions who are ready to be smashed by the HULK. I feel deeply disappointed that such a film could win the academy. So it has the elements of minority, LGBT, african americans, protecting the environment, evil russians and selfish government, so it must win??!<br/><br/>As a conclusion, i feel insulted by the director and the academy. Its winning lowered the average IQ of the entier Los Angeles."

","Typical for a beautiful movie to be underrated by most people. The difference in meta and user score was to be expected. <br/><br/>In my experience, this movie was captivating from the first scene and ended on a high note, with a simple frame, music and quote. Del Toro takes you on a journey, that never goes full-blown fantasy. The minor details in both film and music are sublime. It really brings the story to life. In my opinion, this is one of those movies that don't need any questions. You have to experience is. <br/><br/>Perhaps it is a story that is only enjoyable for people that daydream. The ambiance and message are set up in a way, a hopeless romantic could feast on for days. Seeing as most Hollywood movies are complete rubbish, this one really shows what a movie is capable of. Bringing the love of a celebrated director on screen. Go see this movie!"

","G. Del Toro has been frequently fawned over as a 'masterful story teller'. I found nothing 'masterful' about it. I absolutely could not hook in to this film. It made no logistical sense at all. It also had a dark and cartoonish feel to it like a Bat Man film. <br/><br/>The setting in which the story takes place is deeply flawed. Eliza (the dumb one), and Zelda (Octavia Spencer) work as cleaning ladies in a so-called top secret facility when there seems to be nothing top-secret about it.<br/><br/>The cleaning pair wander at will throughout the facility and discover it's also 'top-secret' biological specimen with no clearance at all. Right.<br/><br/>And low and behold, the biological specimen is none other than the Creature from the Black Lagoon! This time in living color and many upgrades.<br/><br/>One might also notice Octavia Spencer is appearing in every other bomb out of Hollywood as a supporting actress and nothing more. Maybe in ten years they'll give her one of her own movies. Not holding my breath.<br/><br/>Back to the Creature. We'll call him Creatch for short. The homely Eliza has a strict routine of hard boiling eggs while she masturbates furiously in her bathtub every morning. Eliza is fundamentally scared to death of normal men. She then brings the food to Creach, which she eventually falls in love with.<br/><br/>Creach is super duper intelligent and can instantly learn English, American sign language and writing, but likes to savagely dine on the occasional domesticated cat here and there. Right.<br/><br/>Creach also has super powers. He can almost instantly heal bodily wounds, as well as restore hair to a bald man. Alright, that one small bit I found pretty cool, but that's it. <br/><br/>Eliza eventually decides to kidnap Creach, for his own good, so she can turn him loose into the ocean just one step ahead of Russian Agents who have infiltrated the facility for the soul purpose of killing him. Again, not a very top-secret organization.<br/><br/>Shortly after that, Eliza and Creach begin having sex. That's right. An otherwise normal woman gets it on with a humanoid looking fish that looks like it dried out in the oven too long. Happens all the time I guess.<br/><br/>The two subplots involving a sadistic head of security and an alcoholic neighbor who works as a graphics artist are barely even worth mentioning.<br/><br/>And the ending? Beyond impossible.<br/><br/>This story is strictly reserved for the over-emotional, over-romantic, and completely naÃ¯ve.<br/><br/>Go see it if you really want to, but you have been warned."

","The whole movie is an unendurable combination of cliches that don't add up or become interesting at any point. The discretely repeated attempts at delivering overused social messages makes it even worse. Even those messages are shallow in content, irrelevant to the movie and extremely unoriginal just as the story itself. I hoped during the movie that it would get better at some point but it went just worse. For those who are aware of these issues this is just a pretentious attempt and for the rest they don't care or won't get that message from a movie like this one.<br/><br/>I witnessed one of the worst movies of all times. You can't blame a movie for receiving an award but this clearly shows the demise of the movie industry as such movies can be produced and nominated and awarded just because of the exploitation of the social issues, and juries getting revenge and amplify the message with their own means. Engineering the marketing of overrated films became the norm.<br/><br/>Oscar winning motion pictures often became classics now they are not even worth a second view.

","I've thoroughly enjoyed del Toros work over the years, and I am an avid Sci-fi fan so this would have been a match in heaven if the movie hadn't been so utterly predictable, boring and... correct.<br/><br/>Growing up in Sweden, this movie really reminded me of the 70s and 80s when movies where there to educate the masses and not to entertain. Political messages - I don't really care if they are ""right"" or not - belong in propaganda, unless the movie is about said political, obviously. Simply cramming it into a movie - for absolutely no real reason - gives me the shivers. Stop the subterfuge already!<br/><br/>And then, predictability. Oh for goodness sake, who did not see that ending come after, what, 15 minutes? Maybe I've seen too many Sci-fi flicks but it was quite clear immediately. Not the usual del Toro way.<br/><br/>I guess I feel perplex after watching this. Del Toro is good, very good, but this? And this is what brings the Oscars?

","This is not a good movie. It's not well written. It's not well paced. It's not entertaining.
I had high expectations in this movie, being Oscar winner and by Del Toro and all. But unfortunately it turned out to be a massive on screen disaster and frown fest, a big mess. It starts beautifully though with a nice underwater intro. The it's only getting worse. We see the daily morning routine of the mute cleaner who strangely reminds us of a sad and disturbed version of AmÃ©lie, Del Toro maybe had in mind a similar quirky, sensitive and charming character. Something went terribly wrong. The cleaner has a gay artist neighbour and a bestie at work, played charmingly by Octavia Spencer, unfortunately her role is just a stereotype of the slightly overweight, loyal side kick with a heart of gold. Then we meet the antagonist, played by Michael Shannon, another stereotype, white male sadistic mean pervert military guy with a heart of stone. Yaaawn. The fish man the cleaner falls for is basically the creature from the black lagoon. Why does the cleaning lady start having romantic feelings for the black lagoon creature? Because he can't speak either and they both like boiled eggs, so they have something in common, perfect match, ok? Does Del Toro really believe lonely women at a certain age are that desperate?
Del Toro uses same filters and production design as in Hellboy. The background is America in the 50s with style and music reminding not only console players strongly of Fallout or Bioshock. The ballroom scene in black and white is from the Artist. 
There is no original good idea in the movie, we've seen it all before, but better. 
Why did it get Best Film Oscar? Maybe there is deeper political reason for this, I have no other explanation. I don't recommend this movie to anyone. Save your precious time and money and avoid this mess!"

Over the top villain, the research, the stupidity ( if you think its a Russian spy who can stay in the water for so long and does not look like understand anything, just keep it in captivity), the finger , the overuse of painkillers where at one point the infection is so bad that he pulls the finger off but dont feel the pain, the waiting of the tide , instead of going directly to the nearest open sea they took him home, loves the humans but kills the cat( to my logic cat and human both are food for him), bath scene of holding water where water supply was more than the leak to fill the bathroom up temporarily, fishman sudden discovery of immense power and healing and converting a human to fishgirl but in lab just enough to bite off a finger? so means less than a dog, lead girl brainy enough the plan someone smuggle out of top secret lab but not enough to find a sea spot for him to immediately escape in open waters. 
Basically she was just a pervert who wanted the creature for her own pleasure but just couldn't get to it. At the end when she was shot, I felt happy and relieved.

","The Shape of Water is really quite remarkable for how perfectly it embodies the mainstream Hollywood sensibility. Its liberal-progressive undertone appears to be culturally relevant, but completely fails to challenge the audience in any meaningful way. Its story of people living at the margins of society bonding over their mutually subjugated status appears progressive and edgy, but its self-congratulatory moralizing suspends any need for serious cultural reflection. It is really the perfect film for politically correct liberals.<br/><br/>The film features the quintessential villain in the liberal cultural imagination today - a racist, sexist, ableist, psychopathic straight white man in the 60s with a white suburban nuclear family. The film really tries to show us how much of a psychopath he is, so that it can score progressive points without having to acknowledge or confront the larger systems of racism, patriarchy, and capitalism which operate as the social fabric of American society and provide the structural condition for people's exploitation and oppression.<br/><br/>In this regard, the film truly epitomizes the ideological manipulations of liberal humanism. Political, legal, social, and historical structures are conveniently ignored and replaced by a narrow focus on individual prejudices and cruelty. Social injustices are explained by the evil of specific individuals. Oppressed minorities are endlessly ennobled and their humanity uncritically celebrated. Villains are reduced to caricatures and do bad things simply because they are bad people.<br/><br/>Reveling in its technical competence and feel-good petit-bourgeois sensibility, the film is utterly unaware of its cultural vapidity, its artistic mediocrity, and its sinister complicity with the status quo. Sprinkled with some gratuitous violence, it is the perfect candidate for the Oscars - a polished, glib, pandering, ostensibly radical but ultimately uninspired fairy tale peddling a complacent and clichéd liberal humanism."

I love films with romance in, and even if one of the leads was a fish man, I was willing to be open minded and go with the flow.<br/><br/>What a waste of time.<br/><br/>There were so many flaws and strange scenes in this movie that I couldn't enjoy it. For a start, I never really felt the connection between the leading lady and the fish man. She gave him some boiled eggs and seemed to kind of like that he couldn't speak either, and then the next moment we are meant to believe they are deeply in love. I didn't see or feel any real tenderness - just a silly girl who had a school girl style crush. <br/><br/>I found the scenes where she was naked in the bath in the beginning completely unnecessary to the story line and awkward. Was that just to gratify male viewers? I didn't understand what the scenes where she was masturbating were meant to add to the plot either - so she's a woman and likes to masturbate....so what? It just wasn't relevant. She came across as vapid and I didn't see her show any gratitude towards her best friend at work, who repeatedly lied and risked her lift for her! <br/><br/>Like I said, I went into this with an open mind because the story requires you to do so. But there were loads of unbelievable moments which again were just not necessary and could have been made more realistic: pulling a grown man along the ground by a bullet hole in his cheek, filling an entire bathroom with water like a swimming pool just by putting a towel on the floor by the door...and not worrying that her fish man would be found out caught by authorities when water starts pouring into the theatre below, remaining standing in the bathroom when the door is opened and the water rushes out, not releasing the fish man into the sea immediately but waiting for the rain to fill the canal up first - why? The sea was right there! Also her friends have literally no problem with her having sex with the fish man at all. Everyone finds it really normal. And that musical scene...there are no words. <br/><br/>I could go on. For me this movie just fell flat. I thought that at the very least it would be more shocking than it was, but you never actually see anything happen between the lead and the fish man. So if you were going to watch it for the shock and ewww factor, just don't even bother because there's none of that either."

","The Shape of Water is a new take on a very old story as a lowly cleaning woman falls in love with an unusual creature and must protect it from the authorities who wish to destroy it. While the story is not original, harking to films as diverse as Beauty and the Beast, ET and Free Willy, the film is still a delight to watch. Written and directed by Guillermo DelToro, the film is similar in style to much of his work, combining his usual magical fantasy with gritty, sometimes violent social realism.<br/><br/>Sally Hawkins is delightful as the mute cleaner working in a secret government facility where the water creature is held. Her performance is wonderfully expressive and there is great interplay between her and co-stars Richard Jenkins as her neighbour and Octavia Spencer as her colleague.
Michael Shannon growls and bites devilishly as the villain out to kill the creature and anyone who gets in his way.<br/><br/>The film wears its 1960's setting well with frequent references to cold war politics, the space race and contemporary culture. While the film also pays adoring homage to older cinema including a lovely dance scene evocative of early musicals.<br/><br/>Alexandre Desplat's soaring score beautifully underlines the film.<br/><br/>Overall, despite the weak story, the film is a joy to watch.

","I don't really know where to start. This movie is in my top 5 favorite movies! This movie is an artwork. I will tell you why:<br/><br/>Very outstanding is the writing. Things happen fast but they are always written in a very elegant way so that it never seems jumpy. Emotional dialogs and very beautiful turns in the plot. What I liked the most about the writing is the character development. Very different characters but they all fit well together to tell that story. It is very easy for the audience to immerse into the story and identify oneself with nearly all of the characters.<br/><br/>I also really liked the music that makes you feel time travelling back in time and feel all the moments first hand.<br/><br/>To conclude, this is a very elegant and beautiful fairy-tale that is definitely worth watching. It is a new type of love and friendship story that makes you laugh, cry and hate together with the characters.<br/><br/>Magnificent!"

","This was an absolutely horrible movie, I saw nothing in it that deserves an academy award. Yes the lead actress did a good job, but the story line was stupid, kind of like a rehash of King Kong, and most of the other characters were more like cartoon characters rather than real people. I suspect the producers must have a bunch of Russian trolls pumping this movie up. Don't waste your time or money on this movie."
"cddesigns","9","72","138","23 December 2017"," A breath of fresh water
","Few filmmakers have the ability to present a story in a way that is unmistakably unique these days, in the swirling miasma of cookie-cutter movies that are exhaustingly predictable and rely heavily on pyrotechnics and CGI to make up for the lack of heart. But Guillermo del Toro fills The Shape of Water to the brim with a genuineness rarely seen.<br/><br/>Set in 1960's Baltimore, this story is a bit Romeo and Juliet, a bit Beauty and the Beast, except in this instance the beast is the one that appears outwardly normal. A mute custodian with a case of curiosity killed the cat syndrome (Sally Hawkins) becomes entangled in a tug-of-war between American and Soviet government powers after she discovers a creature being held hostage by the facility she works at, and her endlessly kind heart won't allow herself to let them use it as their pawn. The villain of this story, Strickland (Michael Shannon), proves to be one of the most complex characters. He serves up no shortage of the aforementioned beastly qualities, projecting his frustrations of his failings as a man and subsequent own self-hatred on everyone around him in a variety of ways. Torture, intimidation, emotional manipulation, racism, verbal and physical abuse and sexual harrassment are all employed by him, even a lack of basic hygiene is displayed as he fails to wash his hands after urinating in the first scene the audience is properly introduced to him. Despite all this, del Toro and Shannon still manage to make it clear that while this character wields a considerable amount of power, we get quite clearly the feeling that he is also powerless - a sad, joyless man with a lack of connection to his family and a lack of any kind of fulfilling relationships in his life, grasping at threads of power in the hopes of catching one and somehow finding the innate sense of pride and worth he has always been searching for. People respond to him out of fear rather than out of respect. He is a puppet of the system, under the thumb of greater authority and he knows it. It fills him with a rage that he takes out on anyone who either earns - or doesn't earn - his ire.<br/><br/>Elisa (Hawkins) shines with a genuinely heartfelt performance. Meek and often terrified of the brutality she sees around her, but also tough in her own way, the audience will find it difficult not to like her. Entirely without verbal dialogue, Hawkins is successful in portraying the kind spirit, gutsy strength and quirky personality of Elisa. Likewise, her screen partner The Asset (Doug Jones) delivers a very convincing portrayal of a creature that's not quite man and not quite animal. He moves in a unique way that is signature to Jones but yet has a quality (and statuesque figure) also reminiscent of the god that some of the film's characters wonder if he is. Zelda (Octavia Spencer) and Giles (Richard Jenkins) are the perfect kind of kindred spirits, with Giles being a realist and Zelda being motherly at the appropriate times that Elisa needs them to provide that for her. Like her, they share qualities that render them ""imperfect"" in the society of the time; Zelda is a woman of colour, Giles is gay, and all of them have a greater than average sense of empathy.<br/><br/>Particularly and curiously impressive is the way opposing elements in this film fit so perfectly together - drama, horror, comedy and even whimsy-filled musical routines all somehow work in harmony with each other in a way that feels very natural. The fairy-tale elements are balanced carefully with the more adult aspects of the story, so while there are certainly some tear-jerking and frightening moments, viewers still leave at the end with a feeling of magic and inspiration. Plausible and implausible scenes and elements work so well together that the audience can easily accept the story for what it is.<br/><br/>The only real criticism to put forth is that the development of the relationship between Elisa and The Asset is patchy - we see snippets of their admiration for each other growing, but then it seems to take a leap between friendship and deeper intimacy that the audience feels a bit left out on. The film follows Strickland and Giles' characters more closely as far as interpersonal relationships go, something that the film could have used more of for greater development of Elisa's character and deeper understanding from the audience of how much she has really suffered. The character of The Asset is never truly developed either - however, this may be very intentional as del Toro stated in previous interviews that the creature represents something different to everyone. Perhaps it is up to the viewer to decide what he represents for them. In some ways, this renders the character an eternal victim - always being used for something by someone. For governments, a weapon; for Giles, an artistic muse; for Strickland, a punching bag to offload his anger onto; and for Elisa, a recipient for her love and intimate desires. Although the creature reciprocates her affections, we can't shake the fact that he never really initiates them, just follows suit, leading one to wonder what decisions he would make in that matter (or any) if he had the freedom to do so.<br/><br/>With all its complex beauty and freshness, The Shape of Water is a must-see for those wishing to experience a film that's truly new, and to feel the true soul that comes forth in it."

","What a beautiful movie both in terms of the cinematography and the story. The colors and the imagery were so beautiful. The story, not unlike Amelie in the tone, was romantic and magical. <br/><br/>The movie builds and ends on a high moving note."
"MihaiSorinToma","7","3","3","7 January 2019"," An unique idea which feels quite flat
","After seeing an odd creature in one of the laboratories of a facility in which she worked, a mute woman begins to empathize with the creature which was being held hostage so she slowly begins to interact with it. Pretty soon, a connection is made between the two which might lead to something more from her side at least.<br/><br/>It's an unique movie which describes the life of a lonely mute woman and the events that follow her first eye sight with the creature. It's plot is quite interesting I must say, slowly building up tension and emotion while also delivering plenty of drama and even suspense. Most of its characters are very well thought and described, contributing to a rather slow but interesting course of events. It manages to avoid boredom most of the time by introducing something new pretty often, but the pace still feels a bit sluggish. My complaint here would be that its antagonist/s don't seem very compelling. You know that he'll do something bad but you don't quite feel it. It's some sort of predictability from the plot combined with a lack of credibility from the bad side. It's not dramatic or something but it spoils the overall sensation.<br/><br/>The visuals are nice, the creature seems very credible with its bestial form and some special effects, from time to time, deliver some very pleasant scenes. Its time setting with the retro cars, shops and buildings also do a very good job, aided of course by the music of that respective period which goes nicely with the décor.<br/><br/>I have to say that it's a good movie, but unfortunately, it wasn't able to leave a mark on me like other great ones do. Yes, it's one of a kind and yes, it has a good plot, but it doesn't feel like it was made to be great. There are many things left unanswered, a couple of issues with the antagonists and the finale is quite predictable and thus not very satisfying. Don't get me wrong, it's not a bad movie, but it wasn't able to impress me in such a way that I would feel that this is actually a multiple Oscar winning film. I might not understand the role of these awards but unfortunately for me, this isn't the first one that wins plenty of statuettes but doesn't seem like a movie that would have deserved them."

","Guillermo Del Toro mentioned that one of the driving ideas behind this was for the monster to get the girl. I'm not going to give this away, but unlike some of the naysayers who've damned this film, they obviously didn't watch it with their eyes open. Who can make a film like this for under 20 million these days? Obviously Guillermo can. This is a dark and beautiful fantasy that one has to pay attention to. The story flows like the water it contains and I can't single out any one performance since all of them are so excellent. I would have liked it if the Amphibian man had a little more original look. He looked like Abe Sapien with the creature from the black lagoon's hands. But he is a beautiful creature, streamlined and wonderful. While some may poo-poo this film, It's Del Toro's best original film since Pan's Labyrinth and far superior to either Crimson Peak and the utterly terrible Pacific Rim."
"TheJediWay9","10","53","99","8 December 2017"," One Of My Favorite Movies Of The Year
","""The Shape Of Water"" is the new project from writer/director Guillermo Del Toro who brought us Pan's Labyrinth, Pacific Rim, The Hellboy Movies and to an extent The Hobbit trilogy (which gets to much hate). I wasn't a huge fan of Crimson peak, but the Shape Of Water really looked intriguing from the trailers. I sat there blown away by what I was seeing. This is one of my favorite films of 2017. It is unique, original, interesting, intriguing, and weird all at the same time.<br/><br/>Sally Hawkins gives a really great performance in one of the most inspirational performances I have ever seen. her character is mute and has no lines of dialogue aside from a dream sequence, but man does she play this character with confidence. The supporting cast also does a really great job, Michael Shannon of course being the next standout, and no one phone sin a performance at all. <br/><br/>This film has that old school vibe to it. There is a use of a lot of practical effects, and the makeup and hairstyling is some of the best I've seen on film this year. The amphibian creature, if it is motion captured, is seamlessly integrated into the movie that the use of practical effects looks so appealing.<br/><br/>The set designs are also really great. Lots of little details that you have to pay attention to that you wouldn't normally pay attention to. The lighting in these scenes also adds a lot of depth to the movie. There are scenes that are dim for a reason, and some with more lighting for a reason. It is really a great way to use lighting to convey the details of the environment. <br/><br/>This is a story that grabbed me from the beginning. Not once was I bored watching this movie. It kept me engaged and there is so much character development that it ended up making me care at the end. Out of all of the characters that you root for, there is not one single character that you end up not liking.<br/><br/>And if my memory serves me correctly, there is not one scene of exposition in this film. Not one. There are some ""hints"" here and there as to what is going on in the background, but from what I remember it's not explicitly stated. It leaves it up to you to put together all of the clues and I really like that about this film.<br/><br/>I'm happy we got something original in Hollywood. Everyone craves for something original, and then everyone hates it when something original comes out. It was a nice breath to just see something so refreshing instead of plot threads being retreaded and following clichÃ©s that we see in movies nowadays. This is one of my favorite films of the year.<br/><br/>I am going to give ""The Shape Of Water"" an A+."

I loved the whole story, predictable maybe but so what? It was beautifully shot, narrated and portrayed. I felt with the characters and for the characters. It made me feel like I was 10 again and watching ET for the very first time. I absolutely LOVED it. Do yourself a favour and make up your own mind about it.

"carlos37andre","9","65","124","4 March 2018"," One of the weirdest movies that I ever saw (but this is not a bad thing)
","Ok, The Shape of Water definitely isn't a movie for the big public, it's incredibly weird (as almost every Del Toro movie), and unusual, but at the same time it can pass a beautiful and complex message about love.<br/><br/>Before talking about the movie as a whole, I need to point some fantastic aspects of it. The acting is very good, Sally Hawkins and Octavia Spencer (as you may already know) shine in the movie, and their nominations are undoubtably deserved, but Michael Shannon also shows again that he is a freaking monster, he once again destroys in the role. I really think that he deserved at least a Oscar nomination here (probably more than Richard Jenkins, that is also very good, but not as good as Shannon).<br/><br/>The cinematography and the photography is gorgeous, Del Toro shows us once again that he is one of the most unique directors working today, the guy has a style, and it shines here.<br/><br/>Talking about that, Del Toro direction is freaking amazing too, everything is beautiful, the actors are shining, the guy will probably won the Oscar tonight, and it will be deserved.<br/><br/>And, of course, the overall message of the movie, the prejudice, the feeling that some have, that they are alone in the world, how hard it is for some people to find love, and how painful it is for those who end up never finding. And is really fantastic how Del Toro is able to talk about such subjects with a movie about a big fish monster that make love with a woman.<br/><br/>Really, think about it, what were the odds of this end up been just a creepy and laughable movie? The concept sounds extremely cheesy but the final result is fantastic.<br/><br/>All the visual effects also are fantastic, and the movie does not had a big budget, so, is another achievement here.<br/><br/>Probably the only issue that I can have with the movie is that in some point it seems like it's going to end without a climax, but it kinda ""forces"" somethings to happen, in order to have a ""big finally confront"", you know, it doesn't make the movie less great, but was what prevented the movie to be a 10/10 to me. I think that they also could have given more time to the build of the relationship between the Fish and Elisa, overall you buy it, but it feels a little bit rushy.<br/><br/>Well, in short, The Shape of Water is a great piece of work by Guillermo Del Toro, has a beautiful and powerful message, that is told in a unique and odd way. Another great movie from the 2018 Oscar's, right now I saw 7/9 from the Best Picture Nominees, and just one was under the 8/10 grade."
"spaztasticnerdette-13722","10","75","145","9 January 2018"," A Stunning Masterpiece!
","I usually find Guillermo del Toro's film either a hit or miss but this one is definitely a hit. The Shape of Water is a fantastical love story filled with charm, wit, danger, and somberness. While I will agree the story is a bit predictable, the characters are no less impressive and the story telling is on point with what it's trying to convey to its audience. Sally Hawkins is phenomenal with her portrayal as, Elisa, a mute woman whom cleans for a governmental facility and stumbles up on a creature they call the ""the Asset"", portrayed by the brilliant Doug Jones. Together their performance as two characters whom do not speak with their voice but with sign language or just by actions is truly breathtaking. While the overall plot may be a little unoriginal, I do believe its derivative is done with a creative twist and a spark of genius on del Toro's part. To have a strong female lead be a mute woman with timid tendencies and a quirky yet charming personality was a stroke of pure genius and you really empathize with her character. <br/><br/>However, there is one more actor I would love to applaud for his work and that is Michael Shannon. His work never ceases to amaze me and he always portrays his villainous characters so well. His character in the movie, Richard Strickland, is the very definition of a bigoted and ignorant man I would hate to know. There times in this film where you are just feel completely disturbed by his presence and this is only watching him on the big screen! I cannot imagine what it felt like to be face to face with him while he played this vile character. I was really disappointed Michael Shannon did not even get a shred of a golden globe nomination for his performance because he truly deserved one. I love characters that I can relate to but if an actor can do their job well and really make me hate their character then I know they deserve respect. <br/><br/>If you are looking for originality in regards to plot, I can't say this film is for you. If you enjoy originality in regards to characters, atmosphere, and special effects then this film will be for you. Its a wonderful and unique romance for those who want something different or whimsical. Overall, I do believe it deserves its praise in some areas of originality and wonderful storytelling done in such a charming way. In my opinion, its one of Guillermo del Toro's finest films he's ever made."

","The difference between art and propaganda is not simply that the latter has an agenda. Art can have an agenda, too. But it's nuanced, disguised, suggested, induced (sometimes subliminally). While propaganda is singletrack-ed. No nuance, no symbolism, just plain, repetitive, broken-record-style, in-your-face agenda. Think communist or nazi posters. Then again, socialism and anti-Americanism is all the rave in Hollywood, lately. So, it shouldn't surprise anyone that commie-style poster movies get all the hype in Hollywood, nowadays. <br/><br/>Well, this is such a movie. You get the liberal perpetual and puerile recipe of the bad ""white conservative"", the ""toxic general"", and the not-that-bad soviet spy, which we should forgive anyway because ...uhm, let's see, he dies in the end? The other side of this cocktail of cliches is, of course, the ""good open-minded liberal"". So open minded that interspecies sex should be no problemo. Oh, but-of-course: God? Pfff!

"Alexander_Blanchett","9","46","85","8 January 2018"," Great work of creativity
","A beautiful and sensual masterpiece of Guillermo Del Toro. Its one of the most creative stories in years, that's for sure, even if the subtle storyline refers to the famous ""Beauty and the Beast"" theme. Its a brave film that works even due to fantastical elements mostly because of the great amount of emotions from what the film lives. Not only the story is creative, so are the characters, especially in the way the are connected. Another great choice was to have all lead characters with a burden. You have a mute lead the film, a gay loner being the second lead and a colored help being one of the greatest heroins. 
Sally Hawkins was fantastic. She really has a brilliant year with this and ""Maudie"". One more prove that she is such a versatile actress. The performance she delivered was so tender and soulful, that you must love that character. Michael Shannon was the villain, and while most of his actions were a bit stereotypical, the character was not. He got an interesting backstory and was very well developed. Shannon himself went beyond that and once again gives a very intense and memorable performance. Richard Jenkins had many great and memorable moments that really stick with you. He makes you care for his role from the first appearance on screen to his last. And you feel sorry for him all the time because of the very natural turn he did. Octavia Spencer is a true scene stealer. Her speciality to mix wit with seriousness works here just perfectly. Its a great role for Spencer and she possibly gives her best performance since ""The Help"". There is so much going on behind her eyes. You really miss her when she is not on screen. The score is beautiful the look is tremendous and Del Toro told the story like a novel. Sometimes he let it go a bit, especially towards the end but generally it is a very intense and focused direction. 
Surely a film that sticks with you and I am glad that Hollywood did not lose all its creativity."
"mexlight","10","46","85","27 December 2017"," The love story we needed.
","Such a beautifully, weird love story. Also a story of the life of the outsiders of society during the 1960s. The monster in this movie is the ""normal"" everyday man. The main character Elisa never speaks, as she is mute, but she makes one feel with the emotion she portrays with her eyes and body language. In a world and time where someone like her would be seen as less than, she lives a comfortable life in a world of her own making. She seems to lack a certain something, a sense of fulfillment, maybe. 
All of this changes when ""the asset"" is brought into the government lab, where she works alongside her African American friend Zelda, as a janitor. Seen by everyone else as a thing, Elisa treats the Amphibian Man with kindness and develops a friendship with him. 
Other than this love story, the Shape of Water portrays a 1960s world where kindness is found in the other, outsiders, and malice is found in the ""normals"". It is a beautiful movie to look at, with a plot that flows."
"Marc_Israel_365","8","60","114","29 March 2018"," The Shape of Your Limitations
","The latest beautiful film by the dark fairy tale fantasy director Guillermo del Toro reminds me of hearing 40 year olds talk about what they got out of going to college . It seems that you get what you put into it. I'd claim the same goes for this collective homage film that will certainly open your eyes through many theatrical portals. I found an immediate thought of the French movie ""Amelie"" due to the quiet nature of our protagonist and the smart and artful use of color. It's a romantic viewing for those who appreciate such things and yearn for a better nature in ourselves. This 1960's period piece, set in Baltimore, Maryland, certainly doesn't look like any John Waters film I ever saw, but the small city with a chip on it's shoulder is carried well by the outsider and monster of the movie played by Michael Shannon. Yes, his characters' depth won't go past wading levels, but the fim isn't about character depth, and the story is the star. The movie has a collective voice of characters who, although silenced by the social indignities of that time, rose above themselves for the greater good. Octavia Spencer is understated but is our eyes as an outsider and our conscience as a friend. The only person who this doesn't hold true is Elisa, our protagonist, part mousey mute and part ""quite female"" to say the least. She's daring on a number of issues, but it feels as for personal gain, despite the pure heart angle. I will watch this again to see if I come away with that same sentiment. <br/><br/>The ""asset"" is more reminicent of the Watchmans' Dr. Manhattan in it's perfect masculine form, allowing the romance to be ""somewhat"" believable, but it does appear one-sided for the majority of the film, so not sure how to handle the folks grabbing their pitchforks about their time with the film. If you love film beauty and are willing to spend time away from your everyday troubles, this flick works in it's own way. Predictable, sure, but vividly engaging!"

"Metaflix","8","58","110","22 December 2017"," A tour-de-force of Guillermo's del Toro's world-building ability
","The Shape of Water stands out for the way Guillermo del Toro is able to give this fantasy-laden film such a distinct time and place, in this case a military research facility set in the 1960's, which highlights del Toro's masterful screenwriting ability. The writing is further gilded by its intellectual depth, with characters remarking about the origin of certain words and names, or drawing on biblical references to better frame the predicaments they're in. And if del Toro only wrote the screenplay, he'd still be receiving acclaim, yet this entire production is his. All told, he's credited as the writer, director, and producer.<br/><br/>The film exhibits an alluring, Amelie-like color profile, with water motifs throughout, featuring a career-making performance by Sally Hawkins. The selective use of nudity and sexuality adds a real sense of depth and fullness to her role, making the character seem that much more lifelike, and Hawkins certainly makes the most of it.<br/><br/>Her performance is quite simply magnanimous. She's outwardly tender and sweet, with an inner strength and resolve that manifests itself whenever the occasion calls. It's a combination of perfect casting and the actress rising to the occasion that, in my estimation, places her as the odds on favorite to win the Golden Globe for Best Performance by an actress in a drama, for which she's currently nominated, and the Academy Award in the same category, for which she most certainly will be nominated."

","Suspension of belief is what makes movies, like ""The Shape of Water"", enjoyable. I think some of these low rating reviews are people focused way too far in on the logistics and probability of this actually happening in real life. Just enjoy the highly stylized and magical little universe Del Toro has created. I loved his movie so much! This isn't you're regular action-packed sci-fi flick and that's ok. It stands out, for me the plot was built in a way that made me really care about this characters, which doesn't happen often for me. This is, in bulk, a romance movie. To be able to enjoy this movie you can't sit there and think about ""how this could actually happen in reality"". Just enjoy the movie as entertainment. Sure the movie is quirky, but that's just another reason to love it. I know this movie won't be everyone's cup of tea but I stand by the movie. I think another thing that might help people enjoy it more is when you reflect on the movie after they reveal that she too, is like the Amphibian Man. Think about how all the little things hint to her being like the Amphian Man, like the scars on her neck, hard boiled eggs, the scales on the wallpaper in her bathroom, and even the masturbation scenes. The main point of this review is just to remind viewers that it's ok not to take everything so serious and to just enjoy the ride."

","The Shape of Water is Guillermo del Toro's latest epic. We follow Eliza (Sally Hawkins), a mute cleaning assistant and her friend Zelda (Octavia Spencer) as they work deep within a military facility in Cold War United States. Of interest in this facility is ""The Asset"", an amphibian creature of deep intelligence and equally deep ferocity. Its captor, Strickland, is an unfeeling sadist who cannot love but can control and torment. He simply wants a promotion from his military superiors and tortures The Asset at every turn.<br/><br/>Thankfully for the Asset, he is discovered by Eliza, who befriends him and helps him escape to her apartment space, which she shares with Giles, an advertising cartoonist who is falling behind the times, as photography is taking over at present. Giles and Eliza communicate well and he helps her store our amphibian friend, and ultimately befriend and save it. The Shape of Water offers much beyond the story, however. It is a visual treat, the interior of the mysterious facility rendered with a remarkable sterility, Giles' apartment comfortable and replete with a bachelor's sundries. References to Soviet spies abound, and one is in fact an integral part of the story.<br/><br/>See the Shape of Water for its brilliant acting, fine special effects and perhaps even to regain hope for love between differences."

","Beauty and the Beast. Girl and the Gill-man. Guillermo del Toro's THE SHAPE OF WATER is a charming, funny, sensual and horrific love story and the best film Guillermo has done since Pan's Labyrinth. It's a hilarious 1950s Soviet-era sci-fi romance with a very nice, bloody touch of horror.<br/><br/>Elisa, a mute woman played by the adorable Sally Hawkins, works at a top secret laboratory in Baltimore as a cleaning lady.

Elisa falls in love with the creature and she has to get the creature out before he's killed.<br/><br/>The brilliant DOUG JONES plays THE CREATURE.

"Bluegull99","2","8","11","6 May 2020"," Me and Guillermo del Toro - won't happen
","After having seen 'Pan's Labyinth' many years ago and really disliking it firstly for its awfully detailed violence scenes and the general mood in the movie which was just not nicely melancholic but somehow off for me, I now watched 'the shape of water' and well, what can I say? Same thing again.<br/><br/>B. del Torro seems to have a fascination with sadistic, brutal male characters, in the Pan movie it was the stepfater of the girl, here it is exactly the same character with just a different name, here now torturing the aquatic man. Also, although again the movie was somehoe beautifully equipped with old-fashioned furniture and a kind of nice 50s/60s vibe, it again had this unpleasant nightmare-like vibe to it I already disliked in the other movie.<br/><br/>I watched the whole movie and I must sadly say it left me completely cold concerning all the characters, it just didn't get through to me at all. And no, I'm no generally not into these kind of fantasy movies, I was one of the few who really likes 'Lady in the water' which had me crying. So it really is just this particuar del Torro-vibe that puts me off completely.<br/><br/>I would have still given the movie four stars but what botherd the heck out of me was the del Torro had quite the cheek to just badly copy from 'Amelie' - (a wonderful movie I still cherrish after almost 20 years!). A mute main charater, almost the same haircut, the little detail stuff she does and he even used French music instead of English music? I had watched the first five minutes of the movie and already thought, common, that's from Amelie?<br/><br/>So, sorry, me and Benicio, it really just won't happen. I find his movies unpleasant, kind of nighthmarishly vibed, and for my taste he even steals from other great movies. I don't like it, I will never like it."
"richarddillomes","9","57","108","4 March 2018"," Amelie x The Fly
","I was not prepared for this movie. I mean I knew there was something out of the ordinary in it but I was just not ready for it. It's like Amelie x The Fly, that's the best way I can put it so at least you kinda know what you're getting into.<br/><br/>Elisa is a mute that works as a cleaner for a US government facility that has recently come into possession an ""asset"" that might prove useful in pushing the US forward against USSR in the Space Race. In time she develops an understanding with the creature and moves heaven and earth in order to save it from experimentation and possible extermination.<br/><br/>Bringing this extraordinary story to life is a mix of kooky characters led by Elisa played by Sally Hawkins, who was able to communicate more than those who had speaking lines attesting to her well-deserved Oscar nomination for Best Actress. The relatable Giles (he has a cat! he loves showbusiness! he has a crush on the pie guy!) is Richard Jenkins (who you might remember from HBO's Six Feet Under), Dmitri the Soviet spy you'll root for portrayed by the talented Michael Stuhlberg (if you thought Timothee Chalamet will have a problem choosing where to sit at the Oscars, at the Call Me By Your Name or Lady Bird section, Michael has CMBYN, the Post and then this movie). Also worth mentioning is Michael Shannon as Strickland who's a menacing presence to behold more so even than the creature in his possession.<br/><br/>What I like about the movie is it celebrates the outcasts of society: a Spanish mute, a lonely old gay man, an African-American woman who lives for her husband, and the captured creature itself. We often see through the eyes of gorgeous leading men and women, but what it's like to be among the loneliest of the lonely? This movie answers it and it's not as sad as one would think. There's a certain beauty in the way they live their lives.<br/><br/>After watching, I didn't know how to feel or am quite unable to put into words what my thoughts are of it. I feel like I was assaulted, but not really, you know? Maybe it's one of the movies that you either get it or you don't and I'm glad this was one of those times that I did.<br/><br/>Favorite Quote: ""Unable to perceive the shape of You, I find You all around me. Your presence fills my eyes with Your love, It humbles my heart, For You are everywhere."""
"richci","9","57","108","19 February 2018"," Unexpected Gem
","After watching the trailer, I found myself quite uninterested. <br/><br/>I like Guillermo Del Toro's designs, but the 'genre', I suppose, just didn't pull me in.<br/><br/>I ended up seeing this film on a whim (mainly went for Odeon Nacho's) and left with a new film to add to my list of favourites.<br/><br/>The sets were all absolutely gorgeous throughout. I loved the casting choices and felt like they worked excellently. The music was phenomenal, and the story took me to an emotional place I really didn't expect. I don't want to go too deeply into it, or reveal any spoilers, so I'll try to summarise why I think I enjoyed it so much.<br/><br/>If you're a fan of 'retro/vintage', you'll already appreciate this films aesthetic and sound. That was a huge pull for me once I started watching. If you're into excellent creature design, it's a Del Toro flick... I feel as though it also had a lovely tinge of war time drama in there too, for good measure. I'm not usually a fan of romance plots, but this one really resonated with me. For all of those reasons, I enjoyed the film from beginning to end. Even if the scenes were particularly slow or not to my tastes, I found myself captured by the soundtrack, or the fantastic set design.<br/><br/>If any of what I've said makes sense to you, I'd recommend this film absolutely."
"TheLittleSongbird","10","40","73","15 February 2018"," Unsettlement at its most beautiful
","So much appealed to me about 'The Shape of Water'. The trailer and story captivated me, Guillermo Del Toro has done some great work prior (especially one of my favourite films 'Pan's Labyrinth'), the critical acclaim and numerous wins and nominations (including a whopping thirteen Oscar nominations as we speak) promised so much as did the talented cast and having Alexandre Desplat on board.<br/><br/>Luckily, 'The Shape of Water' didn't disappoint me at all. For me, it's one of Del Toro's best and his best since 'Pan's Labyrinth'. It's a beautifully transfixing adult fairy tale with elements of 'Beauty and the Beast', 'Amelie' and 'Creature from the Black Lagoon', while showing a real sense of unsettlement and affectionate nostalgia from film and music from the golden age.<br/><br/>Everything here absorbs, right from the visually gorgeous, musically hauntingly beautiful and really quite wondrous opening to the genuinely unnervingly tense and powerful, in emotion and violent action, climax. The love story is very touching and has a lot of heart, the conflict provided by the as ice cold monster a villain as one can get brings chills up the spine, Elisa and Zelda's friendship has warmth and that between Elisa and Giles has charm and poignancy. <br/><br/>'The Shape of Water' is one of the best-looking films of the year bar none. There is a real fairy-tale, in both sheer other-worldly beauty and sometimes unsettlingly nightmarish, look to the cinematography. The production and costume design are meticulously detailed, evocative (one really is taken back to the Cold War's look and atmosphere) and atmospheric, while the creature design clearly looked like a lot of care and effort went into it and the editing has a natural and cohesive flow. <br/><br/>Alexandre Desplat's music score is ethereal and hauntingly beautiful, especially so in the opening scene, one of the best scored opening scenes of the year. The vivid sound mixing and editing helps it a lot, and the pre-existing music also makes a positive impression with the rendition of ""You Never Know"" touching the soul and haunting the mind. 'The Shape of Water' is one of the best examples of Del Toro's mastery of story-telling when the material is particularly good, like it is here and in 'Pan's Labyrinth', with all the different elements ideally balanced and just as strong individually. <br/><br/>Regarding the script, it's tightly structured, poetic, poignant, nostalgic, thought-provoking and with nothing inconsequential. What is done with the monster is a revelation, not just because the design is so rich in detail, expressive and real but Doug Jones masterfully brings nuances, chills and heartfelt emotion and makes the monster much more than a creature design that looks good but with no soul.<br/><br/>Can't fault the acting either. Sally Hawkins is one of the finest recent examples of conveying so many different emotions and nuances without saying a word, my personal favourite as of now of the nominees for this year's Best Actress Oscar category (yes even more so than Frances McDormand for 'Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri'). <br/><br/>Octavia Spencer is humorously earthy and sympathetic and warmth and sincerity shines through every aspect of Richard Jenkins' performance. Michael Shannon has rarely been creepier than he is here and Michael Stuhlbarg is also fine. <br/><br/>In summary, unsettling and truly beautiful, one of the year's must sees. 10/10 Bethany Cox"

From master storyteller Guillermo del Toro comes THE SHAPE OF WATER,
 an otherworldly fable set against the backdrop of Cold War era America circa 1962Well I have seen 4 oscars nominated films from dunkirk , 
the darkest hour, three billboards and the shape of water all so 
different, they are all so different but It think it will creep up a beat 3billboards with this unique 
beauty and the fish story ,in an undrground facilty is were we see the monster love story begin 
 think sally hawkins moving portaryl of using sign language mkaes her deliever
an enchanting story of never been loved ,the lonely janitor and zelda are janitors who come across 
Richard Strickland character who is saddistic with a creature who is a god like creature with amazing not to give
away the plot to much .
 the vunerables approach to her character is brings out the chemisrty more
than talking it makes it a unique stroy when she meets the monster and he begings to feel her pain for him and 
Despite communicated in silence you can hear them loud and clear from not just their sign language 
but also just physicality which made the connection this what makes its What makes the chemistry truly unique
 is that it's non verbal which to me is the best approach; all the more genuine and beautiful. As Old Pete once said, 
""If love is really true, it doesn't need an answer.""there is also a Russian plot as well here getting under uncle Sam nose 
its a groundbraking film.Michael Shannon plays richard strickland in charge just loves to get under people skin just like zod in man of steel 
he is really is good as a villain you plain hate as he is a monster in the guise of authority. 
Theres an interesting character study about him is we get depth into his diseased psyche as he is literally a product of his time,
 a man living on fixed notions on what a person is supposed to be,
As ever, Richard Jenkins is a class act he is her neighbor and he is s quiet and puts in a terriffic friendship with Eliza that pulls at the heartstrings 
who longing to help her with her problem of freeing her love healso loves his art and captures her momets in pretty detail imagination
 Octavia Spencer loves to into her oscar films she brilliant as eliza sidekick
del Toro's wildly imaginative adult fairytale is an opulently entertaining monster fable that is spectacularly stylised and perversely enchanting.
this 2hrs 3mins its really does get into your heart.She will no doubt bring home a golden statue at the upcoming Academy Awards.
this film is a classic a monster movie made with real love"
"david-genestal","9","38","69","16 March 2018"," A true declaration of love for the cinema
","Guillermo del Toro is back at its highest level after Crimson Peak and Pacific Rim, two minor films compared to the legendary Pan's Labyrinth and, now, this magnificent Shape of Water. His taste for poetry and dark atmospheres is right back, as his ability to mix sensitivity of things to violence. There is a lot of humanity in the Shape of Water and a mischievous magic from which Pan's Labyrinth was stripped. From the first frames, we are drifted away by the strong current of this extraordinary love story, carried by great actors and actresses. Deprived of speech, Sally Hawkins is a receptacle of incredible emotions and turns a potentially rickety exercise into a beautiful silent symphony. Michael Shannon has the mouth of the job, odious and fiercely bad, engulfed in his American vision of success. In supporting roles, Richard Jenkins and Octavia Spencer ensure the touching and funny side of the set. And what about the creature, that distant cousin of that of the Black Lagoon of 1954? A creation in too artificial CGI is fortunately avoided to accommodate a little humanoid jewel perfectly integrated into the story and through which the emotion flows freely. An iconic representation of the acceptance of difference, sometimes martyr, sometimes lover, the keystone of this adult tale, the creature amuses and moves, without excess and with surprising accuracy. The subject, daring in its last faces, could have turned to shipwreck. But the talent and the energy of the whole crew, the care given to each image, to each movement of camera, to every word, avoids the ridicule, finds the right balance and propels the Shape of the Water towards summits of poetry. A true declaration of love with cinema, immersed in a great bath of nostalgia. A terrific film with well-deserved success."

"FelipeCarrillo","10","54","102","15 April 2018"," A monstrously powerful fable about love and loss where plot simplicity, narrative depth and artistic beauty are unified and glorified
","Without false decorations, there is no doubt that ""The Shape of Water"" is an eye-catching drop-dead gorgeous masterpiece, Del Toro's last Magnum opus is a eerie and charming homage to ordinary-people-do-extraordinary-things stories and, without hyperbolizing my extreme love for this filmmaker- although that's just the truth -his film is one of the most clever, stirring and visually handsome experiences, a deeply moving and impressive modern-cinema classic, an artistically perfect, beautifully acted, directed and scripted impossible-love movie that I have seen in my whole life.<br/><br/>For the most stringent movie-buffs, like me, the first thing coming to light when the screening is over is that the script has many plot holes, namely, neither it provides minimal explanation about how or why was the creature created, nor uses scientific technicalities or the peripheral problems of the main role, the supporting characters or the time in which it's developed; the film simply doesn't walk around and to enjoy it is necessary to understand it in the way its director wants: As a story about monsters in which love and loss, as a whole, play the greatest roles. <br/><br/>This film allows executing extraordinary tours de force for two members of the cast. Year after year, the great Michael Shannon surprises more and more. His Richard Strickland is voracious, egomaniac, magnetic and terrifying; this performance is made by real quality, portraying a man oppressed by machismo, greed and power, possibly a reflex that reconciles in a good way with the mess of sexual and labor harassment that has begun to be strengthened in recent months, an epitome of all those monsters with ties and contacts that simply require and cancel. On the other side of the coin, the second monumental performance lies, of course, on the shoulders of Sally Hawkins, getting that a mute lady gains a powerful label, not a new icon of female overcoming or anything by style, a sign of love, faith, and freedom. <br/><br/>Del Toro keeps doing his job excellently, selecting a top-notch artistic team. Flick after flick, story after story are strongly driven by an overwhelming visual tidiness, leaving out genre or purpose, it's a tradition that each of its motion pictures means sublimity in creative fields. His newest work could be placed on the top of the podium. ""The Shape of Water"" is what it's thanks to the hard work put on it, a feat that must be recognized and praised. Dark colors and lack of brightness are trademarks, each scene uses the global tonality in order to encompass throughout the film the feeling that the filmmaker wants the spectator to get. While in the opening sequence prevails a gloomy green color in the water, in the later set-pieces you can appreciate green olives, pale whites, yellowish and greenish blues that give shape to the idea. In addition, such colors are also applied to costumes, makeup, staging and visual tricks, supported by an ideal and particularly opaque illumination that denotes a quietly beautiful time. Pictures are flawless. Its cinematography embellishes key scenes and the ingenious approaches switching from one scene to another use old-school techniques that Del Toro frequents, and here get a new level of complexity and intensity, simply outstanding. Alexandre Desplat is also an important piece in the puzzle, he plays again a role of issuer of emotions by means of sound, through a work that surely will give him besides an enormous recognizing, satisfaction and pride for becoming one of the most requested Hollywood composers. <br/><br/>Guillermo Del Toro's ""The Shape of Water"" is a devastating experience, not due to its subtle horror moments, its entertaining material or its mischievous comic sense, but simplicity and delicacy with which this filmmaker treats his invention, a work brimming with gold qualities that are not created by film-romantic traditionalism, the core purpose is a message about loss and happiness, because this, in many cases, means love, and that's precisely the meaning of the movie title. In its entirety, water may never be contained, water is amorphous, love is amorphous, therefore, its conceptions are entirely immeasurable. It's one of the best years for Mexico in the American industry thanks to ""Coco"" and ""The Shape of Water"", it's also time to remunerate all the contributions for cinema made by this peculiar filmmaker. While some people give him millions of dollars and little gold men, we, the dreamers and most loyal followers, give our deepest respect, admiration and gratitude, becoming, at least personally, a true role model."

","Oscar Nominations:<br/><br/>
So what is 'The Shape of Water'? I suppose that question might have two different meanings, so lets start with the simplest question 'how do you describe the form that real, liquid, water takes? Seems like an easy question until you try to answer it. 'Like a liquid', doesn't really cut it, and something like 'a blob, or pool, of liquid' ends up being circular. Ultimately, to answer that question, one has to end up saying something like 'it takes the form of whatever container it is in'. And that may be about as good an answer as it gets. <br/><br/>Interestingly, the answer seems to work in response to the same question about the movie 'The Shape of Water' - it will likely take on the form that each viewer wants to see in it. The movie has a moving, shifting, and yes, fluid, nature to it that defies easy categories. If, like me, you find it convenient to peg movies with genre labels to help understand what emotions and thoughts it will likely inspire, the exercise with this movie will be a little frustrating.<br/><br/>The Internet Movie Database (IMDb), puts it in boxes labeled Adventure, Drama, and Fantasy. And I suppose it has elements of those. There is a plot-line involving Russian spies, and a scheme to steal an important 'asset'. And the 'asset' in question isn't exactly human, at least from outward appearances and so represents a fantastical creature of the imagination. Certainly, some of its deepest moments reflect heartfelt emotion tinged with tragedy.<br/><br/>But the movie could just as easily be called a work of science fiction, because of its setting (a 1960s research lab) and similarities to other science fiction classics (like Creature from the Black Lagoon). There are moments that provoke laughter as you see buffoonish characters, bumbling their way through a scenario that almost evokes scenes from the Three Stooges, or the Carol Burnett show. At times it could certainly be considered a 'thriller'. And, as the trailers convey, it is also a romance, even with requisite, and non-gratuitous, sex scenes.<br/><br/>In short, this movie defies description and that is, I think, part of its intriguing charm. This movie, like water, takes the shape of the container that you put it in. The fact that it succeeds so well, regardless of how you look at it, is a testament to the high quality of the film. It meets or exceeds expectations.<br/><br/>And the expectations were high. The Shape of Water was the Oscar darling this year, receiving the most nominations (13), and winning the most awards (4), including Best Picture of the year. It received nominations above and below-the-line, reflecting the fact that it was a balanced movie with quality attention lavished in nearly all aspects of the movie craft. <br/><br/>The Shape of Water is the brain-child of Guillermo del Toro, who wrote, directed, and produced the movie. He was nominated for the original screenplay and won the Oscar for directing it. This is not his first trip into Oscar-country - he was nominated in 2006 for both writing and directing Pan's Labyrinth, a movie that shares a lot of traits with this one, including a fantastical creature, and relationships that can only be characterized as surreal. The earlier movie might be considered practice for this one, which achieves a level of surrealism that seems even more plausible. Del Toro has displayed his science fiction and fantasy roots in writing and directing the Hellboy series and the first two Pacific Rim movies (not counting the most recent one, released earlier this year.). And he showed how easily he can coax human sentiments out of non-human characters in his fabulous Hobbit movies. In a real sense, Shape of Water might be considered as the highest expression of his art form.<br/><br/>The vision of the writer and director is important, but without great actors, the message doesn't get delivered. Casting Sally Hawkins in the leading role, as a mute and very sensitive janitor, Elisa Esposito, was a stroke of genius. She was nominated for leading actress - but lost to Frances McDormand in Three Billboards - and was previously nominated for her supporting role in Blue Jasmine (with Cate Blanchett). Although she normally plays supporting roles, her facial expressions and body movements, in this movie, convey her strong acting abilities even though she has no real dialogue throughout the entire film.<br/><br/>As noted before, with the Three Billboards movie, it helps when the entire acting ensemble is of high quality since the acting gets reinforced as each actor plays off the others. Hawkins is lucky to work with several exceptional supporting actors, two of them also receiving Oscar nominations. Richard Jenkins, who plays her next door neighbor, Giles, and the sympathetic narrator of the movie, received a leading actor nomination for the Visitor several years ago. And Octavia Spencer, was previously nominated for her supporting role in Hidden Figures, and won the Supporting Actress Oscar for her role in The Help, plays Elisa's co-worker at the research laboratory. She is a perfect verbal counterweight for Elisa's silent machinations.<br/><br/>Not nominated, but playing critically important roles, are Michael Shannon as the government- spy-bureaucrat-villain, and Doug Jones, who plays the all important creature (and also never speaks!). The combination of these actors creates a fluid ensemble that flows together perfectly.<br/><br/>A great movie, though, isn't just above-the-line. del Toro was able to bring together a team of craftspeople of exceptional talent. The movie won nominations for cinematography, film editing, costumes, and production design, winning the Oscar in the last category. The design does a terrific job of evoking a 1960s science fiction setting, in combination with a feel from an early James Bond movie (think Thunderball). The camera work makes use of lots of contrasting lights and darks with light sources reflected off of metal surfaces. And the creature's costume is a perfect job of suggesting creepiness and beauty at the same time, part of successfully suggesting multiple emotions. (Apparently it took Doug Jones three hours to get into costume every day!).<br/><br/>Shape of Water also received nominations for sound editing, sound mixing, and original score. Because so much of the movie revolves in and around water, there were special challenges in rendering sounds that reflected that environment. And although I hate to say it, the music from Alexander Desplat is so 'liquid' in nature that he certainly evokes the spirit of the movie, and deserves the Oscar for original score - his second Oscar and ninth nomination.
The Shape of Water is a very big movie in a tight, compact package. Although I haven't seen all of the Best Picture nominated movies yet, this one clearly deserves the Oscar so far. It will puzzle you, confound you, and astound you, all at the same time. It takes the shape of whatever container you want to put it in, and leaves you better off than you were before."

","This film is a great example of when a director truly makes the film that they wanted to. This is the story that Del Toro wanted to tell and it is told exceptionally well. The Shape of Water boasts great performances from its cast with Sally Hawkins delivering an outstanding and passionate portrayal of a mute woman who falls in love with a monster simply due to the fact that it accepts her for who she is and doesn't see her faults. The film's characters however can fall into stereotypes with Octavia Spencer playing a sassy black character and Michael Shannon playing a bible verse spouting badguy but nevertheless these parts are played well. The films also fully embraces its 1960's setting, celebrating the music and TV culture at the time and this adds a feature of charm to the film. In the end The Shape of Water is a charming, well written monster film with only some minor flaws but these do not draw away from the viewing experience."
"prabhatrayal","9","35","63","29 January 2018"," A Wonderful Love Story
","The Shape of water starts in the same way as Pan's Labyrinth. The camera moves underwater and a person starts narrating the story of Elisa. This opening scene was enough to make me fall in love with the film. The camera moves through a narrow opening and stops in a big room where we see Elisa floating - unconscious. I think this scene literally shows you the Shape of Water. From the first scene itself, the cinematography hooks you in. The way the camera moves and the greenish color grading results in some beautiful shots. The work done by Cinematographer is top notch and I have come to expect that from Guillermo's movies. As the story progresses, you get to know the characters. There are some quirky moments in the film that will make you smile. There are some moments that I did not expect to be in this film. I thought this movie was suitable for kids but it isn't. Anyway, coming back to the topic, the first encounter between Elisa and the creature is pretty well done. It makes you feel something. And that creature looks like Abe Sapien from Hellboy.<br/><br/>The strongest part of The Shape of Water is the powerful performance from the lead actress Sally Hawkins. She gave it her everything. I have seen her in others films (she was good) and she completely nails the character of Elisa. As her character is mute, the whole film relied on her body language and physical performance. I can't imagine anyone else doing this role. It was made for her just like Wonder Woman was made for Gal Gadot. Also, another main character is an amphibian who can't speak so it relied on Doug Jones' physical performance too, and just like Sally Hawkins, he played his role wonderfully. But he has gotten used to playing animals and fantasy creatures, so it was not that hard for him. Sally was the underdog here.<br/><br/>But there are some other things that make The Shape of Water an amazing experience. The direction by Del Toro is outstanding. He knows how to get the best out of his actors. There is not a single moment in the film that didn't fit like a cog. The screenplay is also good. The cinematography, as I have already mentioned, is wonderful. I love those subtle camera moments and the color grading. It was eye-pleasing. Then there's the background music which perfectly fits the mood of the story. It is nothing groundbreaking but contributes more depth to every scene.<br/><br/>There are some shortcomings in the film but they may be ignored as the good things more than make-up for it. The shortcomings are nothing more than nitpicks, so I would not go into the details.<br/><br/>The Shape of Water is one of the best movies of 2017. It is also my second favorite Del Toro film after Pan's Labyrinth. It is good to see that he still has that magic with him. It has been nominated for 13 Academy Awards and will win many of them. It deserves some of those much-coveted trophies."

","Honestly it was a really good movie. It has a very childish theme to it, but in an adult content setting. Something you wouldn't expect to work, but it did.<br/><br/>I don't get the bad reviews. It was a different kind of movie with a happy ending that delivered a pretty good message that love knows no bounds. Yeah the fish man wasn't the most attractive, but the main character didn't care about that. They were both lacking something and they gave each other what the other was missing.<br/><br/>It was a super sweet movie and I even got to laugh a couple of times. It deserves the Oscars it got and everyone who disagrees honestly just needs to get their heads out of their butts. This isn't a movie that goes ""YAY BEASTIALITY"" it's a movie that promotes love past looks."

"kirbylee70-599-526179","9","34","61","29 March 2018"," LOVE IN THE STRANGEST PLACES
","I was stunned this year when they announced the winner for the best picture category at the Oscars. How could it possibly be that a movie whose description reads like a low budget horror film from the fifties could win top prize? And from a director known for movies filled with comic book heroes, monsters, ghosts and tales of fantasy? And yet it happened. Now that movie makes its way to disc.<br/><br/>The film takes place in the early 1960s in a government run research facility. Unlike most places we've seen in the past this location actually employs people to do real every day jobs like clean the place up. Elisa Esposito (Sally Hawkins) is a young mute woman who works the janitorial staff alongside her friend Zelda Fuller (Octavia Spencer). When not working she shares an apartment over a movie theater with her advertising artist best friend Giles (Richard Jenkins).<br/><br/>Something big is going on at the facility with the arrival of several people. First is a scientists named Dr. Hoffstetler (Michael Stuhlbarg), followed by special agent Richard Strickland (Michael Shannon). The third arrival shows up in a tank, an amphibious being or fish man played wonderfully by Doug Jones. Captured in South America by Strickland the two have an adversarial disposition to one another.<br/><br/>But Elisa sees something the others don't in the amphibian man. She sees a kindred spirit, another person who is different from the rest and ridiculed or tortured for it. Seeing the cattle prod tipped in blood used by Strickland on the creature she decides to reach out to it instead. She shares her lunch with the creature, nothing more than hard boiled eggs, but in treating it kindly she breaks through to him.<br/><br/>None of this is noticed by the research team. She, like several characters in the film, are ghostlike non-entities, people who are there but never seen by those they work among. The only person who witnesses her communicating with the creature is Hoffstetler. But he won't reveal this. Why? Because he's a Russian spy sent to gather information and possibly steal the creature if possible.<br/><br/>The story fluctuates between the tenderness and bond that forms between Elisa and the creature, the mean spirited, bitter and cruel treatment that Strickland pushes on any and every one (including his wife) and the characters found in the periphery here. Each contributes something to the forward movement of the story. Giles is gay and shunned but the film doesn't focus on that. Blacks are turned away from a restaurant he visits. Zelda is talked down to by her husband.<br/><br/>Halfway through the film the decision is made to destroy the creature. Elisa and her friends set out to rescue him before that can happen. They succeed and take him to her apartment where she keeps him in the bathtub. It is here that her fondness for the creature morphs into not just affection but love as the couple become intimate with one another. It's become one of the more controversial moments in the film but needn't be coming off as more natural than most love scenes in films these days.<br/><br/>But we know that the bad guy, Strickland, will eventually be pushed to become the evil government force that thinks only of killing anything they find. It's a slow buildup to that point and when it happens in the third act you know something will change the lives of all involved before the final reel.<br/><br/>I've always been a big fan of Guillermo del Toro. While I've missed one or two of his films, I've yet to see one that I thought was bad. He has a visual style all his own, one that brings the fantasy realms to the screen and makes them believable. He does that here again creating a world, a creature and a romance between species that makes sense if that's possible. A fan of monster movies he turns the tables here making the hero the monster and the monster the hero. And it works incredibly well.<br/><br/>The acting here by all involved is great as well. Kudos must go to Sally Hawkins for her bringing life to a character who has no way of speaking except with her hands, face and body language. She does so with skill. And while he may be ignored consistently by the Academy Doug Jones brings to life a creature that emotes through his body like no one else can. He's done this time and time again and never gets recognized for it. Shame on those who think the only way an actor acts is through the language they project.<br/><br/>In the end the movie may not be for everyone. There is nudity and sexual situation that mean the kids can't sit in while you watch it. But for adults who understand the circumstances the story revolves around and who can find the romance beneath the makeu"

","I like a good story and here we have a good story being told. It helps if you are a fan of the Creature From the Black Lagoon and the sequels. Hey, the guy only wanted some company and was willing to do what it takes to get some. In this movie, we are introduced to a sort of fairy tale telling of the world of what if and what could be which exceeds our thoughts but feeds the imaginations. There were a couple of sex scenes that I thought were not necessary at all and one wonders why they are in this? With them gone, this could have taken its place with Beauty and the Beast and brought the lessons to children more. It also ran a little long but for those that like a good build-up they wont' be disappointed. When watching this movie, if one believes there are no accidents, that the heart can prevail by its own rules and not giving up allows it to do so then a treat awaits. The bad guy in this movie was a little over the top and the premise of what to do with the ""creature"" doesn't pass common sense but it doesn't have to either. The movie still prevails.

","Going into this film, I had already heard a lot of the award season buzz, so I knew that there were at least some really good parts about it. And that buzz was not wrong; this movie is spectacular. Literally, this film is a spectacle. The visuals of this movie are gorgeous- the colors pop brilliantly, the shots are stunning and unique, the lighting is dynamic and intriguing, and the effects are incredibly impressive. The Amphibian Man looks fantastic. He really looks like he's there, and the combination of CG and Prosthetics work incredibly well together. What carries this film, along with the effects, are the performances- the whole cast of this film is brilliant. Sally Hawkins gives an outstanding performance as Eliza. She's poignant and sympathetic and stunning, and the angle of her being mute really carries her performance, and also carries her relationship with the Amphibian Man. Michael Shannon's performance as well, as well as the reflection of his character against the setting of the 1960's, is really enlightening and interesting. His last line is my favorite line in the movie. The problem's I have with this film mostly stem from the third act, where things start to get a little cheesy and predictable, but the ending is still very well earned. This movie has elements of a a great fairy tale, and has a lot of potential to become a classic story. 8.3/10"

"petra_ste","8","33","59","20 February 2018"," H.P. Lovecraft's Beauty and the Beast
","There is something endearing about director Guillermo Del Toro - a childlike enthusiasm, a genuine passion for cinema in general and genre movies in particular - which sets him apart from both the cash-grab cynicism and the workmanlike indifference of many of his peers. The Shape of Water has the peculiar Del Toro touch - a sincerity which makes this fantasy romance work.<br/><br/>Set during the Cold War, the movie follows the relationship between mute janitor Elisa (Sally Hawkins) and a mysterious amphibian man (Doug Jones) kept prisoner in the government facility where she works; as brutal Strickland (Michael Shannon) plans to vivisect the creature, Elisa decides to free it with the help of her friends Zelda (Octavia Spencer) and Giles (Richard Jenkins) and the cooperation of a sympathetic scientist who happens to be a Russian spy (Michael Stuhlbarg).<br/><br/>This is a beautiful film, shot with grace and style, dominated by a sea-green color palette, with impeccable set design and costumes. Del Toro's films feel visually rich without showing off; there are no unmotivated camera movements, no ""five minutes steady cam shot just because I can"". I was amazed to learn this movie has a meagre (for Hollywood standards) 20 million dollars budget.<br/><br/>Hawkins is luminous and compelling as the lead. Del Toro's regular Jones is wonderfully expressive - his amphibian being has a physical presence only practical effects and make-up can achieve. <br/><br/>Shannon's Strickland is an effective villain, with his cattle prod, rotten fingers and a sociopathic streak somehow flying under the radar of his Norman Rockwell family. Del Toro has this gift for creating antagonists who are over-the-top horrible (see also the Captain in Pan's Labyrinth) and yet, strangely enough, they don't end up as boring caricatures. Spencer and Jenkins bring pathos and humanity to the potentially cliched roles of the sassy black friend and the quirky gay neighbour. <br/><br/>The beginning of the relationship between Elisa and the creature, while lovely, feels a little rushed - too quick and unproblematic on the part of Elisa, who is cooking eggs and playing Benny Goodman for her amphibian pal before you can say ""The Shadow over Innsmouth"". This cavalier attitude towards supernatural threats is also part of the Del Toro touch, I guess, with the kind of unfazed acceptance of the unusual and weird you usually find in fairy tales.<br/><br/>7,5/10"
"Johnny-the-Film-Sentinel-2187","10","33","59","15 February 2018"," One of 2017's very best films!
","The Shape of Water accomplishes the same subversive realist-fantasy that made Guillermo del Toro's Pan's Labyrinth such a modern classic in the first place. Del Toro has achieved the same sensationalistic and stylistic modern fantasy in similar vein to Pan's and HellBoy I & II. Del Toro knows to put the REAL in 'surreal' and applies believability of the highest order.<br/><br/>What is it about del Toro and the way he's approached fantasy films by applying an extra dimension of reality into the mix? Pan's Labyrinth was groundbreaking for its gritty post-Spanish-Civil-War story told alongside the story of a girl who may be the long lost princess of a kingdom long-forgotten. The Shape of Water does the same thing albeit during the Cold War and in 1960s Baltimore, focusing on a mute girl and a fish-man from South America, who form a romance defying all rhyme and reason.<br/><br/>The Shape of Water is like an old-timey fairy-tale movie but an adult reimagining of classic Disney movies like Beauty and the Beast, The Hunchback of Notre Dame, Spielberg's ET, and even has mild elements that evoke 2K-Games' classic BioShock series.<br/><br/>This film is a fantasy film for naysayers of the genre; it has the kind of 'teeth' some of those critics may be sorely missing out on. This is a gorgeous piece of modern cinema that I think anyone can appreciate regardless if the people in question are avid fans of fantasy cinema or not.<br/><br/>Del Toro is easily one of Hollywood's greatest filmmakers and give the guy control over any fictional domain and he knows EXACTLY how to command a memorable story on the big screen."

","Beautiful, fairy-tale pure story was not only a metaphor for the too common inhumanity of man toward anything not exactly like man, but was also a love story showing how love can happen anytime to anyone, and with no boundaries, even death. Filmmaker Del Toro showed the soul and sensibility of the ages here in his depiction of a shy, working class girl who fell in love with a sea creature in a government ""research project"" reminiscent of the 50's Communist era witch hunts. And, with the same dark intentions.<br/><br/>The film's somber mood, dim and sad colorization of the ""research"" area, and the interplay of the characters was so effective in the fairy tale atmosphere it gave to a very serious world problem............man's tendency of hate and cruelty toward anything not exactly like he is, in body and in mind. That that way of thinking is so wrong is well shown here in a harsh way, but also in a way that resonates with anyone who resists that cast in stone way of thinking and acting toward different others.<br/><br/>The acting was uniformly great, as was the soundtrack, sets and costuming. And, of course, ""the creature"" was marvelous, so nuanced and subtle. Loved the unique noises he made, and their individual shading depending on what was happening,.... it was all too....can I say..... ""human"", and one of the best and most informative parts of the story. Enjoy this wonderful film, as you will not see another like it until another Del Toro film comes our way."
"kevinxirau","9","49","92","15 April 2018"," An unconventional beauty.
","Among my favorite directors is Guillermo del Toro. The guy has one of the most unique artistic and cinematic visions in the world of film. His inspiration to become a filmmaker was ""Creature from the Black Lagoon"" of all things. Del Toro's love the Gill Man translated to his passion for monsters, though he felt sad that the famed amphibian never got a happy ending. Initially, he was brought in by Universal to remake it, but that deal went south, so he decided to more-or-less tell his own version of the story, adding a new spin that surprisingly won over both audiences and awards. That, folks, is ""The Shape of Water"", a movie I've wanted to see since its inception. <br/><br/>Plot: In this variation of beauty and the beast, a mute janitor named Eliza (Sally Hawkins), who works in a government facility, meets the Asset (Doug Jones), a fish-like humanoid from South America, and the two form an unconventional relationship. With the Asset under threat of death and subsequent vivisection by the unstable Col. Strickland (Michael Shannon), Eliza will go to great lengths to ensure the creature's survival and happiness, but will she succeed in a world so unwilling to accept that which is different?<br/><br/>This is, indeed, a masterpiece. The Asset is an amazing character with a stellar design and a performance that feels believable (animal yet human-like). Props to Jones and the effects team for making the suit and facial expressions work with flying colors. Sally Hawkins gets high marks from her own performance, a mix of sign language and heartstring-pulling facial expressions. The pair work well together as much as their characters. The rest of the cast did very well too from Shannon's execution of a threatening villain who feels unfulfilled (a product of the era) to Octavia Spencer's humorous inflections to sympathetic portrayals by Richard Jenkins and Michael Stuhlbarg. <br/><br/>There is also much needed credit to the world itself. It replicates the time of which the story is set in very well with many great uses of color, music, and an assortment of objects that are relics by today's standards. The best part of it all is that a majority is physically built with not much in the way of CGI save for backgrounds and a few other aesthetics. Color is also used to convey mood or symbolize a character's status (physical or emotional) and water, as the title implies, is very prominent and more or less serves both a physical and symbolic purpose as well. What little lore that exists in this world intrigues me to no end with many open-ended questions, especially in regards to the fish man. As the film is set in the 1960s, themes of racism/sexism, Cold War tensions, minor religious references, and the classic question of what separates man from monster are explored, all done with superb execution in this case. Heck, the Asset is ideal in that he can represent just about any group that suffers unjust oppression.<br/><br/>Fair warning that, unlike Disney's ""Beauty and the Beast"", this is not for children. There is a little blood + gore, language, and sex/nudity (especially one controversial scene involving the latter in a bathroom). <br/><br/>All in all, ""The Shape of Water"" is, like the abnormal pair, a thing of beauty, one that I imagine will be marveled for generations to come."

","A modern fairy-tale centered around the uncanny power of sexuality. Perfect art direction, and Sally Hawkins is a force (she was the best thing about Blue Jasmine, too). The beginning was more Jeunet than delToro, a few hints of Amelie and City of Lost Children, but the movie found its voice about 20 minutes in. It positively revels in its B-movie tropes (Michael Shannon's first scene sets the tone) and takes them to extremes which were not possible back then when the originals were shot, without changing the basic sensibilities.<br/><br/>Was there something not to like? There's a side-plot about enemy agents which is completely superfluous; every scene we spend with those cardboard Russians is a scene wasted imho; ads nothing to the story and takes us away from the protagonists. In a fairy-tale things should be kept simple. <br/><br/>But overall, while not delToro's best, The Shape of Water is definitely worth a ticket."

"rblenheim","10","48","90","20 March 2018"," A beautiful adult fairy tale by the brilliant director of ""Pan's Labyrinth""
","Guillermo del Toro is today's master of fantasy, having been a childhood lover of monsters growing up in Guadalajara, Mexico, before making some of the finest films of recent years -- from the ghostly horror of ""The Devil's Backbone"" in 2001 to his gothic horror/romance, ""Crimson Peak"" in 2015. Indubitably, however, his greatest film is ""Pan's Labyrinth"", the 2006 film many of us consider the finest fantasy film ever made. Now he's broken new ground with ""The Shape of Water"", one of 2017's most beautiful films. <br/><br/>Set in Baltimore in the year 1962 at the height of the Cold War, the plot follows a mute janitor at a secret government laboratory who forms a bond with a captured amphibian of the ""Creature of the Black Lagoon"" variety. Her name is Elisa, and Sally Hawkins plays her with an artistry that seems to reach back to the silent days of Chaplin and Keaton. Michael Shannon, with devoted viciousness, plays the right-wing Colonel Strickland, someone more interested in dissecting the creature for exploitation purposes than he is concerned over the space race with the Soviets. There are also elements of religious allegory (""We're created in the Lord's image. You don't think that's what the Lord looks like, do you?""). <br/><br/>Del Toro saw ""The Creature from the Black Lagoon"" on TV at 7 years old and it changed his life. Wishing a different ending for it in which the Gill Man and co-star Julie Adams would consummate their romance and live 'happily ever after', he wrote various scripts of a remake through the years that Universal studio executives wound up rejecting. ""The Shape of Water"" is the result of del Toro's dream, and now today, with more permissive filmmaking allowable, he's able to deal with the previously verboten issue between fish and human. The resulting film is a worthy accomplishment not only for its production design (embodying various shades of green) and its special effects, but also for attaining the level of a genuine adult fairy tale that deals with issues of trust, tolerance, and love in the human condition -- but most of all what it's like to be an outsider (whether a lonely mute woman, gay man, overweight black woman, or an amphibious sea creature). ""This is a healing movie for me,"" del Toro states; one likes to think it would be for viewers as well."

After it was awarded multiple awards from various organizations and associations and ultimately nominated for 13 Oscars (and it was a dry week for finding something to see) we decided to give it a shot--and we were both so glad we did.

Del Toro is no stranger to monsters and their interaction with humans, but this is his most intimate, personal portrait of a fictional creature in the real world. Perhaps more than any of his other films, this one feels the most grounded in reality in terms of setting. Sure, the monster isn't very real and the fantasy-like romance exists only for the dreamers who experience this film to relish in and enjoy. This film draws obvious inspiration from Creature from the Black Lagoon. It manages to feel like an homage to it more than a direct copy of it through its creativity and attention to detail that honors its influences instead of disrespecting them. Set during the Cold War in a government research facility in Baltimore, this film finds beauty in the characters and their actions where a less thought-out film would simply set this story in a beautiful city of bright skies and city lights.<br/><br/>Every component of this film works beautifully and effectively when considered on its own or in the context of the film as a whole. Take the cinematography for example. Dan Laustsen brilliantly lights the already aquatic-green set with even more eye-popping aquamarine lighting and tint to give the sense of visualizing things from a certain character's point of view. Even Alexandre Desplat's wonderfully majestic score sounds like it was composed by a pristine orchestra playing under water. The camera glides along the moist hallways and dripping streets as if it were floating through water. Del Toro's direction seamlessly combines all of these components to make a memorable film that belongs among the best of the year.<br/><br/>Having seen it three times already, I am better able to appreciate how it gets to the ending as opposed to only how it ends. Less knowledgeable cinema-goers may call the basic story ""childish"" or ""simple"" based only on certain plot points, but there is a lot more that is happening beneath the surface that is innovative and creative. The characters are all special in their own way and cast the perfect actors or actresses to play them. Each protagonist was silenced, oppressed, or frowned upon by society during the time period. This film makes a statement about America in the early 1960s that could be applied today. Michael Shannon's Strickland is the obvious villain of the film and bursts with electrifying intensity as he stands between the two protagonists' relationship. From the outside and to his family, he seems to be the epitome of the hard-working, bread-winning family man that came to represent American suburban culture at the time. While the villain appears to be the common man to society, the protagonists are all rejected from society in one way or another. Everyone from a black woman to a communist, Russian spy is given a voice and characterization that transcends their stereotypes. The monster isn't who you would think it is. <br/><br/>The Shape of Water may be a film more reliant on its production value and characterization than its story, but it certainly isn't lazy in its screenplay. The screenplay has layers, not only of characterization, but of symbolism and metaphors. It's little details like these that make the film so enjoyable and rewarding upon re-watch. Guillermo del Toro shows true passion and a particular love for film making that few film makers are able to intelligently convey in their films. <br/><br/>On a side note, I was watching Speed the other day and was enthralled by everything about it except for the ending. Don't you hate that feeling you get when you are loving a movie, but then the ending is disappointing and you wish it could be remade with your own ending? Guillermo del Toro knows that feeling."

","The director Guillermo del Toro delivers a timeless story of love and terror mixing different influences since 60's noir and espionage films passing through Walt Disney's tales until German terror movies from the beginning of 20's century. Actually, he offers well-built scenes showing the little monsters and lovers that inhabit each one of the film's characters when they cross the creature way, an Amazon human form being that embodies nature itself. The main character is a mute janitor working to a military scientific facility where the creature is studied. The screenplay chooses her to bare both the social prejudice of being handicapped and a housecleaning hard worker. In fact, she lives stoically her life while dreaming of a better one in her bathtub of a small apartment over an old cinema theater. Thus, from this little place, she plans how to release the creature and herself. The last scene brings the film's synthesis encapsulated in two sentences: ""when you donÂ´t see the form, the form is everywhere"". A final message that portrays the possibility of being loved no matter form you and your love have. Great film!"
"hunter-friesen","8","46","86","25 January 2018"," A part fantasy romance, part monster thriller that could only come from the mind of Guillermo Del Toro.
","A mute janitor falls in love with a fish man during the Cold War 1950's. That's about as simple as you can describe the plot of Guillermo Del Toro's new film The Shape of Water. Del Toro has always had in interest in monsters for his films. No matter how scary or deformed they look, they always have human traits that connect us with them. In this film, Del Toro has crafted his most likeable monster yet and tells a totally original story (trust me) that is part romance, part thriller. <br/><br/>We follow the life of a janitor without a voice, Elisa Esposito (Sally Hawkins). She works in an underground facility alongside her co-worker, Zelda (Octavia Spencer), who talks enough to make up for Elisa's silence. One day a secret test subject is brought into the facility by the psychotic Strickland (Michael Shannon). The subject happens to be an amphibious-human hybrid creature that was found in the Amazon and has been brought back to America in order to be dissected and studied. After interacting together a few times, Elisa and the creature begin to form a special bond of love. Elisa recruits her neighbor (Richard Jenkins) and a sympathetic Russian spy (Michael Stuhlbarg) for a plan to break the creature from his chains and allow him to return home. <br/><br/>The plot carries both a whimsical and serious tone to it. They mostly go together well as we get a fairytale that isn't afraid to embrace a childish feel with adult actions. However, GDT goes overboard once with a song and dance number that comes close to throwing the whole film off during its most poignant time. <br/><br/>This is one of GDT's most mainstream films (apart from Pacific Rim) and is a great way for people unfamiliar with his work to be introduced. He expertly uses his monster experience to make a film that carries a realistic and fantasy tone. <br/><br/>He also makes a very brave film that doesn't shy away from unconventional material. We get to see Michael Shannon having sex after his fingers get severed, political assassinations, and a self-pleasuring scene involving an egg timer. Oh, Elisa and the Amphibian Man also experience, let's just say, a special physical connection.<br/><br/>The most impressive aspects of the film come from the behind the scenes work. The camera is brilliantly manned by Dan Lausten. It flows freely between the sets to give the film a romantic fantasy feel, but he also uses constant rain, dark colors, and confined spaces to make it feel like a cold war noir. <br/><br/>The production design is also outstanding as each set piece is designed with care and precision. It's astonishing that this film was made for only $19.5 million because it looks like it cost more than triple that amount.<br/><br/>The actors create one of the best ensembles of the year. They all carry their weight when matched together and make their characters interesting to watch. Hawkins is perfectly cast and leads the show with her signature shy look. She gives the most compelling and passionate performance of the year, all without saying a word. <br/><br/>Richard Jenkins also gives an award-worthy supporting performance as Elisa's neighbor, Giles, who is going through a midlife crisis in terms of his career and sexuality. His scenes with Hawkins are astounding, but the ones with him alone aren't as great and take away from the important story. <br/><br/>While not breaking any new ground, both Michael Shannon and Octavia Spencer do what they do best. Shannon gives his trademark evil, unhinged authority performance. Spencer does well in a performance very similar to her role in The Help. <br/><br/>Michael Stuhlbarg also continues his amazing 2017 (also in Call Me by Your Name, The Post, and on TV with Fargo) by giving a great performance in the little time he has. Shoutout to Doug Jones as well for playing the Amphibian Man. He gives an endearing performance that brings warmth to his naturally cold-blooded character. <br/><br/>The Shape of Water is easily one of 2017's best films and deserves all the Oscar nominations it will get. Every person in the cast and crew do their job exceptionally and create a breathtaking cinematic experience that makes you feel like a kid again while also giving you the stuff your adult mind wants to see."

","Guillermo del Toro's latest immersive fantasy spectacle began life as a remake of one of the Mexican director's favourite movies of all time - the iconic monster movie Creature from the Black Lagoon. When he pitched his plans to Universal, perhaps as part of their troubled 'Dark Universe' franchise which kicked off last year with spectacular misfire The Mummy, he wanted to tell a love story between the Gill-Man and a woman from the perspective of the titular creature. This idea, which sounds like a dream for film buffs but a turn-off for studio executives, was rejected outright, presumably being for too risque for mainstream audiences. Del Toro stuck with it anyway, and the script turned into The Shape of Water. Would the same film have nabbed the Best Picture at this year's Academy Awards if it was titled Creature from the Black Lagoon? I think not, so it worked out well for everybody apart from Universal, who are probably still licking their wounds from last year's Tom Cruise-starring horror show.<br/><br/>The Shape of Water tells the story of Elisa Esposito (Sally Hawkins), a mute lady who lives in an almost dreamlike apartment above a barely-used cinema called The Orpheum. We quickly learn everything we need to know about her in a wonderfully edited opening sequence, in which she boils eggs, masturbates in the bath, and pays a visit to her neighbour Giles (Richard Jenkins), all before heading off to a top secret government facility where she works as a cleaner. Giles spends most of his time alone with his cats in his apartment, paying the bills by drawing product advertisements, occasionally venturing out to buy pies from a nearby diner and lust after the young man behind the counter. Elisa's best friend and co-worker Zelda (Octavia Spencer) saves her a space in the queue for the clocking-in machine every morning, and has learned sign language so the two can chit-chat whilst carrying out their mundane job of cleaning piss up off the floor and, much to Zelda's befuddlement, the ceiling.<br/><br/>This is 1962 America, where the happy (and white) nuclear family is the very definition of achieving the American dream, but also where minorities are still looked down upon. It's no accident that Elisa, who rarely stops smiling even when she is treated differently for her affliction, is closest to and most comfortable around a gay man and a black woman. The arrival of a strange amphibian humanoid from a swamp in South America and the loving bond it gradually forms with Elisa represents a threat to this very American way of life, at least in the eyes of Richard Strickland, a brutish military official who caught the creature, played with sheer menace by Michael Shannon. Strickland wants to cut the creature open to learn if its abilities can be forged into some kind of weapon, and to keep it out of the hands of the Soviets. Mild-mannered scientist Robert Hoffstetler (Michael Stuhlbarg) wants to keep it alive for further study, but Strickland is given the green light by his superior.<br/><br/>What follows is a daring break-out and Elisa's efforts to keep the stranger hidden in her apartment. The story isn't exactly ground-breaking, and you can probably work out where the film is heading quite early on. However, The Shape of Water isn't a film about surprises and twists, but a strange tale of forbidden love to utterly immerse yourself in. Most directors would struggle to capture a sex scene between a beautiful woman and a slimy fish man with a straight face, but del Toro somehow makes the whole thing feel natural, and most importantly, incredibly beautiful. Longtime del Toro collaborator Doug Jones does some stellar physical work as the creature, forging a chemistry with Hawkins without the benefit of facial expressions or dialogue, relying on otherworldly howls and the odd bit of sign language to communicate. It warrants comparison to del Toro's Pan's Labyrinth, and although it's not as good as the 2006 Oscar-winning masterpiece, it shares much of its creepy magic and vintage character design, and also reflects on a country's troubled past. It's the riskiest and best work del Toro has done since. Suck in a deep breath and take a plunge."

"allanmichael30","1","43","80","14 December 2018"," Remake of splash-Not Directors normal standards but artistic ending to week plot.
","This films is best comedy of the year.
This film explains why women always cook perfect boiled eggs and take baths at same time multi-tasking at its best.
The deaf word for egg's ready only uses only two fingers. They say deaf people other senses are enhanced. This film explains why the deaf girl at work always gets bubble bath and egg timers. ""Enough jokes""
Well I tried to explain the story below:
A deaf and mute girl works as cleaner at top secret secure unit has a black friend and facility falls in love with aqua man, oh I forgot she has gay best friend!
Where do I start the 1950's at the heart of what America loves and still wishes it was or that's what I thought it was, but the year of this film was set in was 1962. The cars showroom a joy to watch and was great scene and Jell-O cafe seemed like it was the American dream in a movie, but don't full a sleep just yet,theirs a monster in town. The monster turns out to be her boss who beats up this creature at top secret facility and shocks with cattle prod on daily basis. Well it's not all is as it seems, the cleaner can get in and out of this secure room without being noticed and is not scared of this blue aqua man, even though she has to clean up after her bosses fingers were bitten off by this creature. Not strange!
Well if that not weird enough there is also a Russian spy on the inside working there and he is totally nutty, he not only notice the cleaner breaking in to facility, but as spy see her communicating with this creature and does not report her, but latter help her free this creature.
Well it seems like Russian and American's both think this creature would make the perfect astronaut even though it's basically a fish-man and fish are no good in space, but they have different idea's Russians want to just kill it and American's want to cut it open to see what makes it tick. Well the deaf woman now has to free this creature so with the help of her gay best friend and Scooby Doo van she escapes with the creature from secure facility. ""totally plausible""
Gay best friend story he's a great commercial artist but seems to be disrespected by his former employer who just got rid of him even though he has lots of talent. The guy only release from this rejection is the hope this guy in a Jell-O cafe could be his lover. He buys more jelly cake that he can eat so tries to feed it to the deaf woman and probably the cats. Not strange
When he tells Jell-O man he has feelings for him in creepy way , he is rejected even though I think Jell-O man was also supposed to be gay but married to woman, what a shocker it is 1962 after all.
Well back to story of escape the creepy guy best friend of deaf woman makes a fake pass but it's so bad, even his cat would not have been fooled. The guy shows his pass to guard but he is no fool he noticed its fake. End of movie.
No such luck the Russian spy uses a poison needle to aid their escape removing the one guard in secure unit. Meanwhile whilst this happened the deaf girl hides the creature in laundry basket and makes her way out only for her black friend to try stopping her. Not strange
Well they make it out to van weird guys van which is not seen entering the secure unit but is seen exiting it and her boss shoots at it.
They escape to what I thought would be a release site not her flat and her boss seems to have had his memory wiped so does not follow up or trace van. The boss then asks all employee's if they know where this creature is? Meanwhile three days pass and she seems to still go to work and facility runs as normal after losing this creature even though they only cleaned this creatures room. Not strange
The deaf girl keeps creature in her flat and floods it making her bathroom in to a fish-tank and within the three days, replacing her egg cooked sign language for full on weird sex with Aqua man. Her gay friend has some strange contact as well with it while shes at work, seems creature might be bi and makes his hair grow but not in good way.
Not strange
She also floods her local cinema, which is below her flat and just does not keeps a low profile, the creature bites the face of her or her friends cat, not sure why.
Well after three days just about keeping this creature alive with salt from Russian spy at work. She can't stand heat so goes to dock to release creature with gay guy. The Russians arrive, but boss man kills them then see creature and lady and shoots both of them. The creature then healed himself and deaf girl and the swim in arty posse the film then ends and she has gills as well.
it also wins Best picture Academy Award.

"edwardjones-23192","9","54","103","1 December 2017"," Sensational director Guillermo del Toro is back to his roots with The Shape of Water. And it's making a serious splash
","Sensational director Guillermo del Toro is back to his roots with The Shape of Water. And it's making a serious splash.<br/><br/>The Shape of Water takes audiences back to the fairy-tale style of earlier movies. The story explores the relationship between mute cleaner Elsa and the creature at the government facility where she works. The premise and plot are a little bizarre, but comfortably so. The plot seems interwoven around some deeper message, as is the case with most of his movies. But there is no explicit social commentary. It is the audience's job to fill that gap.<br/><br/>The cold war backdrops The Shape of Water, but it never delves too deep into the background conflict. The cold war element of the movie serves more as a cinematic backdrop than a scathing social commentary, like in Pan's Labyrinth.<br/><br/>Del Toro uses a generous amount of tropes, especially regarding Michael Shannon's classic bad- guy role. But with the lighter tone, the movie is freer to explore other themes: love, unity, oneness. Or rather, we are freer to explore the themes within the film.<br/><br/>The Shape of Water is at heart a love story, although it feels abstracted enough as to be universally symbolic.<br/><br/>Neither the creature or Elsa can speak, and it is through this commonality that they transcend differences of species. And symbolically, other boundaries like race, class, gender, and sexuality. But it's difficult to entirely indulge in the symbolism when the couple grows more intimate with each other. Things get a little strange then, but it's all light-hearted.<br/><br/>The creature design was also the best we've seen yet from del Toro. He has always favoured physical costume design over post-production. The amphibian man is no different. He looks all the more real for his physical design. This feels homelier amidst the huge shift towards digital effects in modern cinema. There is still some digital effects, but they aren't noticeable. The amphibian man is of course played by long-time collaborator, Doug Jones, who plays nearly all of del Toro's monsters. His acting is impeccable, as is lead actress Sally Hawkins's.<br/><br/>The relationships between other characters is excellently written and performed. The one-sided dialogue between Elsa and every other character is surprisingly evocative. This puts all the more emphasis on Elsa and the amphibian man's relationship.<br/><br/>The colour scheme of the movie really sets it out visually. The vast majority of the sets are coloured entirely in varying shades of blue and green: a kind of teal. This reflects the coldness of the outside world, the coldness of water, and also the historical context."

I originally saw this at a press screening at The Toronto International Film Festival in September and I was so enthralled that I did something I have never done before: I went back to see the same movie again at the same film festival. The second viewing was in <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt5580390/locations"">The Elgin Theatre</a> in Toronto which is used as a key location in the film, so the audience erupted into applause when we reached the main scene set there -- we were watching the characters standing in a cinema in 1960s Baltimore, yet they were in the very cinema in which we were watching them! It was the icing on the cake in terms of sealing the magic into the viewing experience. I even sat in the same row of the cinema as the characters in the movie were placed.
 
I had the privilege of attending writer/director <a href=""/name/nm0868219/"">Guillermo del Toro</a>'s screen talk at The London Film Festival and hearing more <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt5580390/trivia"">about the production</a>, including its childhood connection to <a href=""/title/tt0046876/"">Creature from the Black Lagoon (1954)</a>.

"mbogdan_mail","9","52","99","27 February 2018"," A highly political stab at the American dream
","The visuals in this movie are exceptionally well crafted and the director went to great lengths to immerse the viewer into that 1960's American society atmosphere. One does feel like they're being taken back in time to this idealised world of the American dream which is being talked about so much these days by people like Trump and his doctrine of MAGA. The movie clearly states the failings of that age, the white antagonist high powered man in a suit who treats women like pieces of meat. He claims he has created in the image of GOD which can only be a white God in his twisted mind. We are also presented with the rampant xenophobia of that age, racism, homophobia, discrimination against the disabled and generally anything considered to be different or outside the societal norm. Of course anyone who is a misfit or has ever been discriminated against, even abused for their identity will be able to identify themselves in one of the characters of this film and have a feeling of comfort or solace from watching it. The two lovers, the disabled female and the transgender freak from the Amazon are in essence an unique type of sexual minority. The movie has enough plot twists keeping the viewer engaged in the storyline and what initially seems to be a drama ends to a happy finale which is a nice bonus for this well rounded film. So a very strong political statement packaged in a fantasy love story in a dystopian age when the happy life was perpetually clouded by the shadows of destruction and the quest for absolute power"

"slicedbread117","9","39","72","21 March 2018"," ""A Fairy Tale for a Troubled Time""
","Imagine you're watching a classic Disney fairy tale, like 'Beauty and the Beast' or 'Snow White'. Now take that formula, and mold it to fit a mature tone, a 1960's Cold War setting, with unique lead characters and a touch a supernatural fantasy. Sounds a little bizarre, right? The Shape of Water not only proves the odd mix of elements can work, but does so with an exclamation point, creating a surprisingly outstanding work of film.<br/><br/>The Shape of Water is, at heart, an adult fairy tale. Director and writer Guillermo del Toro's vision for this film is a never-before-seen take on the established fairy tale format which has stood the test of time for countless decades in film. Narratively speaking, the film doesn't necessarily innovate in terms of story progression in this particular genre. The main plot movement is still fairly standard for a love story, and the ending is easily predictable. But it's the exemplary presentation of a completely new way to experience this genre that makes The Shape of Water special. Instead of watching the love story play out between two stereotypical human leads, we see a female mute, and a strangely charming amphibian-type creature in the lead roles. As odd as it sounds, it just clicks. The structure of del Toro's script is filled with ingenious dialogue and terrific pacing, giving so much room for the heart to dive into the story and its characters. <br/><br/>Subplots are present but not distracting to the primary narrative, they help deepen the tale and give it some room to breathe occasionally. The grimmer Cold War espionage setting weirdly blends incredibly well with the romantic fantasy tone, invoking a feeling of danger and security all at once. There are sequences of daring moments, keeping you engaged, then it streams effortlessly into a cleared, heart-warming scene. It's an unusual but greatly inviting feeling. So again, while I can't say the story itself is anything revolutionary, its del Toro's brilliantly flowing dialogue mixed with an exclusive set of tones and characters that propels this age-old storytelling formula into stardom.<br/><br/>Del Toro is a brilliant storyteller, no doubt, but it's the underrated elements that give The Shape of Water its heart and soul. The film is backed by a simple, yet emotionally attaching score from Alexandre Desplat. The subtle and innocent sounding music is so in sync with the tone set on the screen, it gives another layer of depth to be consumed. It may not be a blockbuster action epic, but the cinematography and overall production value is superb, from the scenery to the wowing view of Amphibian Man's design. Smart little nuances cause the soul of the film to thrive and del Toro and his crew get additional recognition for that.<br/><br/>As romantic movie duos go, this one may just take the cake in terms of pure abnormality, but it also might take the cake as one of the best. There's Elisa Esposito, a lonely mute janitor trapped in a life of isolation and Amphibian Man, the out of place creature being used for research at a top-secret US facility. The charming nature of Elisa is written extremely well, its easy to develop a love for the character who seems so innocent, and in her motives, which are just to find happiness in the company of others. The writing of Elisa is splendid, but actress Sally Hawkins deserves monumental praise for a delightful performance, especially in the role of a mute. Hawkins uses facial expressions and physical language to convey her emotions expertly, so well that there's little effort from a viewing standpoint to become attached to the character. <br/><br/>Opposite Hawkins is Doug Jones who is excellent playing the role of Amphibian Man. He isn't necessarily unique in the way that we've seen his character type before; the outcast creature inconsiderately being beaten down, with a character on the opposite side that sees through a frightening exterior. But his mysterious origins and subsequent powers give a defining trait to the character, and it's his interactions with Elisa that make the character work. I didn't expect, but would have loved to see more background development for Amphibian Man. His mystical roots crack the door open for larger storytelling, but for this smaller contained story, what we got was all we needed. <br/><br/>Hawkins and Jones lead the charge for the cast but with two lead characters who don't speak, a rock solid supporting cast in vital, and it certainly is here. Octavia Spencer brings her charisma to the role of Zelda, Elisa's work friend, a character that Elisa feeds off and becomes incredibly likeable, as with most of Spencer's roles. Richard Jenkins is equally as charming as Giles, Elisa's housemate, and the two have fantastic dialogue. Giles also gets a subplot of his own, which pans out satisfyingly in the scope of the main story. Michael Shannon rounds it out in the antagonist role of government agent Richard Strickland, and Shannon is awesome. The character's writing does at times feel a bit dull or rudimentary, but Shannon's rousing performance gives the danger this film needs to counter its romantic charm, he's excellent in the role. <br/><br/>""A fairy tale for a troubled time"". This was the description of the film given by del Toro himself, and there's no better way to put it. It treads into familiar storytelling ground in terms of a romantic love story, but totally reinvents how we look at it. Darker fantasy tones mix with pleasingly pleasant characters, none more so than the leads themselves, to create a fairy tale we really haven't seen before and it's absolutely wonderful. Guillermo del Toro finally earned his Oscar wins with The Shape of Water, a truly unique, unequivocally rewarding fairy tale.<br/><br/>9/10"
"thefilmnotebook","8","39","72","10 February 2018"," Shape of Water: Strangely Poetic
","There are many dimensions to the Shape of Water. Ultimately it is a love story. It is a love that seems to defy reason. Elisa (Sally Hawkins) is a janitor working at a government facility, where one day she comes across a mysterious amphibian man like creature (Doug Jones), captured by government agent Richard Strickland (Michael Shannon). Due an injury as a toddler, Elisa cannot talk, and neither can he. From the outset, this relationship between Elisa and the creature is bizarre, and difficult to comprehend. But, if you look closer, their love is the most pure, and the simplest form you could find. <br/><br/>They saw each other for who they are, and accepted it. To her, he isn't just a freak of nature. She is fascinated by who he is, and shows kindness and respect for him. Having been isolated and repressed for so long, she finally had someone who didn't judge for her for disability. Although neither of them could talk, they communicated most honestly and warmly. Hawkins and Jones ensured that Elisa and the creature's common language was their authenticity and their vulnerability. <br/><br/>Water had a profound symbolic significance for this story. The Shape of Water suggests something is undefined and has no distinctive shape. Water gave oxygen to Elisa and the creature's love. Two of the most memorable scenes in the film involved masterful, artistic use of water. Without water, he could not survive, and she shows her love through being in water with him. Water is their love and freedom and director Guillermo Del Toro lets it bring to the scenes an elegant tranquillity. <br/><br/>Hawkins, who was terrific in Blue Jasmine, gave another outstanding performance here. Although she didn't utter a word here, we could still see her soul. Her character and performance reminded of Amy Adams in the Arrival - the anticipation, the apprehension, and curiosity is all portrayed with heartfelt emotion. Del Toro cleverly employs a couple of side-characters to act as her interpreter for us. Through them, we get clear confirmation for what she is thinking, but really, Hawkins had already communicated what she needed to. Those side characters - Giles (Richard Jenkins) - a gay artist Elisa lives with, Zelda (Octavia Spencer) - an African American janitor who works with Elisa and Dr Hoffstetler (Michael Stulbarg) - a scientist who is also a Russian spy during the Cold War, all had something in common with Elisa, they are oppressed and have struggled through torment. Perceived as underdogs, and not really belonging to society, perhaps Del Toro wanted to show that the greatest tolerance comes from those that are already repressed. <br/><br/>A monster isn't defined by its appearance. Del Toro boldly contrasts Shannon's Strickland with the creature, and let us decide who the real monster is. I could always rely on Shannon to portray a villain who is despicable, yet immensely intriguing. Strickland is icy cold, and Shannon infuses him with a fierce desperation that is deadly, but relatable. He is tortured on the inside and on the outside, and is often infuriated with himself. I found it amusing that he forces himself to only have positive thoughts - it shows that he is constantly running from the truth. We can see that he constructs a façade that isn't him - a family, a luxury car. It is quite intelligent that Strickland's character accentuates the qualities we value in our protagonists - that is truth, honesty and kindness. <br/><br/>I could always trust Del Toro to imagine a world that is exquisitely colourful and exuberant (much like Crimson Peak, Pan's Labyrinth). I have always thought of the theatre as a very romantic place, and to have Elisa live on top of one, was the perfect setting for her romantic heart. The introduction of Elisa and the exposition was expertly crafted, with Alexandre Desplat's buoyant score skilfully complementing the vibrance of her character. The only thing I would have loved to see more of, was the development of Elisa and the creature's relationship, But perhaps it was that simple. We humans tend to complicate love. Perhaps silent dialogue is more truthful than a spoken one. <br/><br/>The Shape of Water has elements of many genres. It is not an extremely comfortable film to watch - there are some graphic details of violence, and for some, it will be a strange film. I'd like to describe the film was strangely poetic, and it is fantastic in that once you have a think about what the film is trying to convey - it is actually done in the most poetic way."
"Pairic","10","39","72","31 January 2018"," A Masterpiece.
","The Shape of Water: A Horror Film but also SF Adventure, Spy Thriller, Love Story, directed, produced and co-written (with Vanessa Taylor) by Guillermo del Toro. Beautifully filmed by cinematographer by Dan Laustin in so many shades of green, teal, aquamarine, tans, brown, gold and red which give it a 50s/early 60s feel. Wonderful production design by Paul D Austerby with a subterranean laboratory and over cinema apartments in which most of the action transpires.<br/><br/>Mute janitor Elisa (Sally Hawkins) and her friend Zelda (Octavia Spencer) work in a military run research facility when a strange Creature (Doug Jones) is brought to the laboratory. The Creature injures Colonel Strickland (Michael Shannon) who was torturing it. Strickland captured the Creature in the Amazon and hopes to exploit its amphibious nature to advance the US Space Programme. Falling in love with the creature, Elisa enlists the help of Zelda, her neighbour Giles (Richard Jenkins) and a kindly scientist, Dr Bob (Michael Stuhlbarg) to free him from the laboratory.<br/><br/>The Creature resembles the 1950s Creature From The Black Lagoon with aspect of Predator and ALF. Jones brings the creature to life and you can truly believe in the love which develops between them. Inter-species sex results which strangely doesn't strain credibility due ti the acting skills of Hawkins and Jones but will no doubt outrage some. Its not so long ago since director Tim Burton in Planet Of The Apes avoided a romance between Astronaut (Wahlberg) and Chimpanzee (Bonham Carter) as he feared that such a film would be shunned by cinema chains.<br/><br/>This is also a film about loneliness, that of Elisa, Giles who is gay, Bob a stranger in a strange land, Zelda who is estranged within her marriage and of course the Creature himself. The Civil Rights struggle takes place in the background as the film is set in 1962 Baltimore. Sometimes it comes to the fore as when the man Giles longs after refuses service to a Black couple in a café. Also, all of the janitors/attendants at the research facility are Black or Hispanic but the scientists/technicians and military police are White.<br/><br/>All of this is expertly juggled and mixed together by del Toro to make a masterpiece. 10/10."
"bbgrantphotostudios","10","39","72","22 January 2018"," The Movie is Perfect -- I saw it twice-- once at the ArcLight in Hollywood
","This movie is perfect. 10/10 -- 
This movie is the most beautiful love letter to the universal monster movies of my youth. Del Toro and I are about the same age and I, too, loved Creature from the Black Lagoon. That's why I so looked forward to this movie--it's a kind of sequel to that creature film and all the black and white movies I still enjoy watching. It's so beautifully done. <br/><br/>The movie begins under water and it ends under water. And in between the first scene and the last scene, a beautiful fairy tale unfolds. There are so many lovely details that are included in the movie and the attention to detail is incredible. The color palette and symbolism in the movie are sublime.<br/><br/>This movie is essentially and lovingly about ""the other."" This aspect unfolds in many ways--Eliza is a woman who cannot speak and must rely on others to communicate for her...her neighbor and friend who is gay and more than likely loses his job over this fact and her coworker who is African American. In the 1960's, when the movie takes place, all of these people would have been considered to be ""other."" Just as the creature is ""other,"" so are the primary players in the movie. Eliza's voice is heard through people who would more than likely not have had a voice during that time.<br/><br/>Some reviewers have balked at the movie's inclusion of beastiality--but this is just preposterous. If you watch carefully, you are revealed small clues throughout the movie that reveal Eliza's true identity as being the same species as the creature. Just because you don't look like the creature, doesn't mean you aren't ""half"" creature. Throughout the movie, clues are given that point to the fact the she is from the water and she loves water: she was found in the water as a baby, she cooks her food in water, she plays and controls the rain droplets on the window of the bus and she even breathes under water at the end of the movie. Her scars resemble gills...<br/><br/>People who give this movie a bad review are angry, small minded, frustrated people with no imagination or love in their hearts or the history of movies."
"bottomsgaming","10","39","72","8 January 2018"," A Beautiful and Enthralling Achievement
","The Shape of Water is a gorgeous achievement in film, one of the best of 2017, and one of Guillermo del Toro's finest.<br/><br/>We'll start with a paragraph that can apply to any of del Toro's films. It's damn beautiful. Every scene, every setpiece, every emotional beat, is dripping with so much character and vibrancy that it's impossible not to be enthralled from beginning to end. Every frame is a masterpiece, and beyond that, del Toro perfectly films each shot in interesting ways that always remain appropriate for the film's tone. It feels like a finely crafted adult fairy tale. It's like a less-steampunk version of Bioshock.<br/><br/>The casting is also brilliant for the roles. Sally Hawkins is the standout, as our protagonist, Elisa. I could not imagine anyone else doing better in this role. There wasn't a single scene, a single moment, where she wasn't perfect for what the film needs. I bought in completely.<br/><br/>The other cast members are equally well-suited for their roles. Octavia Spencer is excellent as the foul-mouthed, funny, and caring friend and coworker. Michael Shannon's villain, while a bit over the top, certainly gets the job done and drives many scenes of the film. Richard Jenkins is a delight, as he often is. And, of course, I've got to give some credit to Doug Jones as the monster. Everything else being great, the movie still doesn't work if the monster is unconvincing or silly, and he nails it.<br/><br/>Another standout, for me, is the score. The music is not only outstanding on its own, but actively enhances just about every scene. It never comes on too strong, it doesn't steal the show, it just gracefully supplements the on-screen action flawlessly. It's in-line with the setting, the themes, the tone, sentimental when it needs to be, and grandiose, orchestral, and sweeping during the more bombast moments. There were many moments while watching where I couldn't help but sit and smile at the gorgeousness of the film, and they were all moments where the score was in full-swing. It's perfectly appropriate for the film itself, and it's also a soundtrack that I wouldn't mind listening to on its own.<br/><br/>While I thoroughly enjoyed every bit of the film, it wasn't without flaws:<br/><br/>The story is quite simple. If you've seen the trailer, you've seen the entire story outside of the final five minutes. Every plot point is easy enough to predict, and every scene plays out as expected (I understand that this isn't necessarily an objective flaw. There's of course nothing inherently wrong with 'simple' stories. I just prefer writing that's generally more enigmatic, I guess). That being said, the scenes also play out with so much beauty, and every setpiece and shot is so meticulously crafted that I'm 100% fine with going along for the ride.<br/><br/>Also, like most del Toro films, there's not much room for thought outside of the film. It gives you everything you need and more, delivers it on a silver platter topped with whipped cream, a million cherries, wrapping paper, and a bow for good measure. If you've seen a del Toro film, you know that he loves his metaphors and allegory. But there's a difference between simply putting this stuff in a film and letting the audience do some work to discover them (which, as a filmgoer, is often the most rewarding aspect of watching well-crafted movies), and repeatedly slapping you across the face with them. Again, is this an objective flaw? Certainly not. Just personal preference, so I'm not faulting it too much.<br/><br/>Lastly, the characters are cartoonish to the point where it feels like the movie is forcing you to feel certain ways, instead of provoking free thought. There's honestly a decent moral and ethical argument in here about the treatment of a creature like this, about how exactly to proceed knowing it possesses a clear intelligence. Instead, we get an over the top, one-dimensional, pure evil villain (another del Toro staple) along with protagonists who are basically too perfect, without any flaws whatsoever. I'm better about overlooking this half of it, as they are at least incredibly charming, and Sally Hawkins is prefect for the role. Listen, given this set up, it's not difficult - at all - to get us on the protagonist's side. Trust that Sally Hawkins as Elisa will get us there (she would have, easily). You don't have to twist the audience's arm and make her go up against despicable, irredeemable evil in Michael Shannon (who is also great) in order to get us there. Just tone it down with the shades of black and white that are layered on these people. It feels like we're being forced to feel a way that we would have anyway. At the end of the day, is it a big flaw? Not really (I've certainly spent way too much time talking about it for how small of a flaw it is, honestly). The movie is great despite this. It's just something I noticed here, and is also prevalent in his other films, so I thought it was worthy of mentioning.<br/><br/>I've spent too much time talking about flaws that really don't hurt the end product all that much. I think the movie is largely so beautiful and enjoyable that the few flaws stick out a bit more. The good elements of this are so great that I'd rather tell people to go see the movie to experience them, while the bad elements are so small and subjective that I feel like I'm obligated to explain them in more detail just to make it clear as to what I mean with my criticisms.<br/><br/>Make no mistake, The Shape of Water is an excellent, excellent film. One of my favorites of the year, and probably my favorite Guillermo del Toro work. I'd recommend it to anyone."
"ayoreinf","9","51","97","4 March 2018"," Once upon a time, in the mythical days of prince JFK
","This is a brilliant movie, a clever fable positioned by Guillermo del Toro in the early 60s, when a fair prince rulled the country, and every thing seemed simpler and more straight forward. And this is precisely what the fable telling us - it never was simple and straight forward. The biggest patriot could be a monster in disguise, the traitor could hide a kind soul inside and a mute, may speak out the clearest of all when calling us all to be more human.<br/><br/>I'll be repeating everyone else saying how beautiful it is. The set design, the CGI, the editing, the cinemtography. Every minute detail combines to create a fairytale setting in early 60s Baltimore, and it's so perfectly done that one feels that both parts of the reality presented in the movie are indeed real. The acting is part of the truthful feel of the film Michael Shannon, Richard Jenkins, Michael Stuhlbarg, Octavia Spencer and everybody else in this magnificient cast, Topped by Sally Hawkins, who deserves an Oscar, which I fear she won't get, because some consider her being a mute in the film a less complete performance. In my book it's a perfect 10. I haven't seen such level of perfection in acting since Hugh Jackman in Logan, and he never got nominated.<br/><br/>I have my reasons for ranking this masterpiece just 9 (should've been a 9.5+) but I don't think these are important. The movie is so close to perfection the tiny faults it does have, become insignificant. Just go see it if you get a chance."

Sally Hawkins is phenomenal especially considering she had to play a mute person and still signing throughout the whole film, The connection between all the characters was portrayed sensitively and correctly with Octavia Spencer also showing the difficulties of being a coloured woman and how hard it was to still be accepted.

","From one of my favorite directors, even though his last film (Crimson Peak) was a bit of a miss for me, comes the most unique and bizarre fairy tale you'll ever see, even though it is not for everyone.<br/><br/>What I don't get is why is everyone bashing this film for three reasons that make absolutely no sense. Either they are bashing it for being too black and white (which I agree to an extent), even though all characters are deeply flawed, and even if they weren't, it's still a fairy tale, I don't see anyone criticizing Beauty and the Beast or The Lion King for the same reasons. Or they bash it because the villain is a white male, even though the whole story happens in a military setting during the cold war so, who were you expecting to be in the military, an elderly woman? lol, and there's also a guy that helps the protagonists who is also a white straight male, so this makes no sense. Or they are bashing it for being unrealistic, which is just even worse because the plot of the movie is about a girl who falls in love with a merman of sorts.<br/><br/>Rant aside, I don't want to spoil much, just watch this for the amazing settings, the amazing cinematography, the great acting, an unique plot and an incredible love story that should be creepy, but it just isn't because of the amazing directing.

"rayfoy-30576","9","37","68","25 December 2017"," An imaginative piece of storytelling and a work of art
","The Shape of Water is another fantasy-morality drama from Guillermo del Toro with the imagination and ambiguity of his Pan's Labyrinth, though with less engrossing storytelling. As a movie, I see it as a cross between Creature from the Black Lagoon and Splash with moral themes and compelling cinematic imagery.<br/><br/>The core plot is that a man-like, amphibian creature has been found in the Amazon basin and brought to the US for study in a government lab. The time is the mid 1960s and so the creature is a desirable ""asset"" for the US and Soviet governments in their Cold War contestings. Kept in a holding tank, the creature is treated as an animal until discovered by Eliza (Sally Hawkins), a mute janitor. Eliza, personally suppressed from her disability, finds sympathy with the creature's situation and forms a relationship with him. While she's supposed to be cleaning the lab, she feeds him eggs, plays music for him, and teaches him sign language. When the government authorities, represented by Colonel Strickland (Michael Shannon), decide to kill and dissect the creature, Eliza and friends facilitate the creature's escape. <br/><br/>This central plot of ""escape of an intelligent, sympathetic, fish creature who is loved by a human,"" struck me as the basic plot of the 1984 Tom Hanks comedy, Splash. The similarity extends to the creature's cruel confinement and unsympathetic study, and even to the shedding of its scales in misery. Now, Splash was a good movie and certainly not original in its genre. I don't fault del Toro for using a similar plot device to drive his movie because he took it beyond that device. Rather than just entertain us with a thriller storyline, he incorporates theme and imagery to say something.<br/><br/>The Shape of Water's central theme is a solid, Good vs Evil, extended to Misfits vs the Deluded Normal. Again, maybe not so original, but well done. The sets evoke the pre-digital 1960's with massive machinery and systems in a lab controlled by human technicians rather than computers. It all has a ""dirty"" look indicating that a large cleaning crew is required to keep it up. While that does stretch the believability of facility security (something innocuous in today's world) it is part of the fantasy and a needed plot device to put Eliza in proximity to the water creature.<br/><br/>The movie's look complements the Fantasy vs Reality theme that is also prevalent in Pan's Labyrinth. Here, it's seen as transitions between black-and-white and color scenes. In an opposite take on The Wizard of Oz, however, the fantasy scenes are the black-and-white ones, reflecting the fantasy depicted in the old musicals seen on the characters' TV sets. Even here, though, del Toro blurs the edges with a scene set in a movie theatre where The Story of Ruth is playing in bright Technicolor. So, with such changing cues, where do we find fantasy and reality? Maybe in people's actions, or maybe we can't.<br/><br/>There is also a religious theme that stems from the movie's consideration of Good vs Evil. We see a black-and-white view of God in Strickland's hubris where God is a white male human. Hence, in this view, the amphibian creature cannot be more than an animal (nor can people of color, represented here by Olivia Spencer's character). Playing against that, is the evoking of The Story of Ruth as a tempering Bible story where an autocratic God is not featured and the dominant theme is compassion.<br/><br/>As a master cinematographer of fables, del Toro uses his medium to depict his themes rather than pontificate with dialogue. Having his protagonists being a mute and a creature unable to speak underscores this and urges us to finding the proof of things with our own eyes. And so we see the Perfunctory vs Compassionate theme in the sex scenes (yes, this movie earns its R rating), and the delusion of Escape vs Reality in the TV broadcasts of musicals and Vietnam news footage.<br/><br/>Where the movie touched base with Creature from the Black Lagoon is in its depiction of the amphibian creature. Mr. del Toro chose to use an actor in costume for this character rather than CGI. That was a good move. Mr. del Toro's creature bears a resemblance to the Black Lagoon creature, even to the point of the webbed fingers with claws. Its ""breathing"" gills enforces that resemblance and allow the creature to be fearsome when required. Overall, though, he is depicted as another sympathetic and obvious misfit. Someone should win an award for this costuming. <br/><br/>While The Shape of Water is a fine example of movie-making, it has its flaws. It doesn't draw us into its characters as much as Pan's Labyrinth did. The evil is more institutional rather than personified (Michael Shannon's Strickland comes off as more crazy than evil, as opposed to ""the Captain"" in Pan's Labyrinth), so we don't feel the threat to the characters as much. Also, the ending felt ""forced"" and gratuitous. Still, what I did like about the ending, was its melding of the ""happily ever after"" ending of Splash with the ambiguity of Pan's Labyrinth. <br/><br/>The Shape of Water makes its mark in rising above the general fare of ""blockbusters"" offered by Hollywood. It is thoughtful with themes beautifully expressed in its visual medium. Those themes are classic in storytelling, but are progressive when compared to those in the current run of movies that seldom go beyond cliche and propaganda. I heartily recommend this film as an imaginative piece of storytelling and as a work of art."

All the characters in typical romantic movies are the same, but Elisa and the ""amphibious creature"" are different from those characters. <br/><br/>Alexandre Desplat's score was also astonishing. It was light, simple and after the film ends it makes you feel like you're half dancing out of the theatre. <br/><br/>And of course we can't talk about beauty of a film without talking about the visual side.

","Saw this at the cinema yesterday and loved it ! Definitely worth watching. <br/><br/>Plot-wise, the film offers nothing new. It is basically a reworking/mash up of vintage creature features and the classic 'Beauty and the Beast' storyline. Socially awkward/withdrawn girl finds and falls in love with misunderstood beast, set in early 1960's Baltimore in a Cold War era top secret research/military facility. <br/><br/>The real magic in this movie stems from both the lush cinematography and the flawless cast. The sets and feel of the movie are very true to the times. Del Toro relies heavily on green symbolism - one character stating that 'green is the colour of the future' - and the entire movie has a hint of green. The significance of the colour is interesting, and would love to find out more about that. <br/><br/>The casting choices for this film are perfect. Sally Hawkins played the lead role to awkward perfection. Michael Stuhlbarg and Michael Shannon were really natural choices as the shifty/conflicted scientist/spy and the dead-inside antagonist, respectively. My favourite acting duo in this film come in the form of Octavia Spencer and Richard Jenkins, whose comedic performances really made the film. It was also amazing how the movie touched upon their personal lives as segregated minority groups whilst focusing on them as such multidimensional characters. <br/><br/>These days, it is rare to watch a film that really elicits the number of emotions (and some tears) that this movie has done. Very well done Mr Del Toro!"

"TheMovieDiorama","9","34","62","24 February 2018"," The Shape Of Water is an ominous dark romance that acts as a love letter to classic cinema.
","All rise! Guillermo Del Toro, you have earned the right to sit among the greatest directors of modern cinema. Although, his masterpiece 'Pan's Labyrinth' is a greater accomplishment, this twisted period love story cements his talents. A mute cleaner in a secret facility encounters an enchanted sea creature and rapidly falls in love with it. With it currently being tortured and threatened to be executed, she takes it upon herself to kidnap the asset before it's too late. Del Toro is a director who excites me. Why? Because he is one of the few that boldly utilises creativity to paint canvases filled with magic and memorable imagery. His directing style is always so competent, to a point where I eventually forget I'm watching a film and actually believe I'm there in the picture. What he has crafted here is a beautiful tale that captures romance elegantly. Conveying themes of human destruction, solidarity and most important true love. A human falling for an amphibious creature, it does sound ridiculously childish yet Del Toro confidently sprinkles violence and gore to camouflage the inconceivable plot...to actually make it believable. Yes, our protagonist conveniently falls for the creature rather too quickly (and that's my only major criticism) but as the story unfolds we find the two are more connected on an emotional level. Rather touching I must say. The constant classic films in the background, Desplat's vintage score and the nods to silver screen traits (like monochrome tap dancing) heightens the cinematic appeal of the narrative. Sally Hawkins gives a luminous and powerful performance using just actions which conveys her emotions eloquently. Richard Jenkins provided great comic relief that honestly surprised me. Michael Shannon always plays an antagonising villain. In fact, all the cast members were fantastic. I literally could go on and on about how much I adored this experience. It's not just a film, but a journey and one that I will remember for a long time."

Elisa's story is one of resourcefulness when vulnerable, showing the strength of compassion, love and empathy when all seems lost.
The visual style was outstanding and dragged (or rather, waltz'd) me back to the look and feel of Jean-Pierre Jeunet's The City of Lost Children with it's film-noir-esque use of light, shape and rain.

"Movie_Muse_Reviews","9","34","62","29 January 2018"," A beautifully realized, transporting adult fairy tale offering vintage Hollywood magic
","Guillermo del Toro already showed he could make a film like ""The Shape of Water"" before. His gift for turning historical fiction into fairy tales was abundantly clear in the stunning 2006 film ""Pan's Labyrinth"" - it's just a shame we had to wait so long for him to enchant us again.<br/><br/>The delay was probably because Del Toro has many mistresses as a storyteller, namely horror, science fiction and fantasy, so the fact that he has such a big heart hidden beneath his inclinations toward surface-level genre pleasures always seems to come as a surprise. In ""The Shape of Water,"" he's able to scratch all those itches, but he and co-writer Vanessa Taylor craft a story rooted in classical romantic ideals of good, evil and love, pushing back against the complexities of most modern films to deliver something pure if not escapist. <br/><br/>The story has dark turns and embraces violence, race and sexuality in a way you would never have seen if the film were made even 20 years ago, and that gives ""The Shape of Water"" an unexpected verve to accompany its many classic tropes and general romantic aura. In other words, the film presents and plays out in a way that's more traditional Hollywood than any of the other most-talked-about films of the year, but upon closer examination is actually quite progressive.<br/><br/>Taking place in Baltimore during the Cold War, the film essentially tells the story of a group of social outcasts who try to save a mysterious human-like sea creature from being exploited and experimented on for the sake of America's pissing contest with Soviet Russia. It is Elisa (Sally Hawkins), a woman who is mute, who becomes taken with the creature (Doug Jones) at the facility where she is a janitor, because it makes her feel seen for more than her disability. So she recruits her black co-worker (Octavia Spencer) and closeted neighbor (Richard Jenkins) in her quest to free it from the clutches of the high-and-mighty Strickland (Michael Shannon).<br/><br/>That's a little bit of the in-between-the-lines plot summary, but it shows the way the story blends traditional elements with contemporary consciousness. Each actor is perfectly cast in his or her part (many of the roles were written for the actors), with Hawkins and Jenkins the highlights. Hawkins doesn't even get to use her voice, but she channels so much through her hands and face. Jenkins is most of the comic relief, though certainly Spencer provides a major dose as we've come to expect of her based on ""The Help"" and ""Hidden Figures.""<br/><br/>Some of the talents fill traditional Hollywood roles in a largely predictable story, but no knocks can be made against ""The Shape of Water"" in terms of artistry. ""Pan's Labyrinth"" won three Oscars 11 years ago in the categories of cinematography, production design and makeup and this film will earn similar honors. More than even the details, however, is the powerfully cohesive vision behind the entire film. Everything from the vibrant '60s shapes and colors of the production design and costumes, to del Toro's and D.P. Dan Laustsen's elegant camerawork and lighting to Alexandre Desplat's score create the magical world of the film and contribute to its transporting experience.<br/><br/>The many subplots (especially those of Strickland and Michael Stuhlbarg's Dr. Hofstetler) and themes of ""The Shape of Water"" don't feel as interconnected or as convincing as they aught to be for a film operating so fluidly on so many levels, but it's a small knock against the screenplay in a film that is quite simply beautiful inside and out. In its simplicity, strong cast and many marvelous technical elements, del Toro offers audiences a variety of ways in which they can latch onto the romantic spirit of ""The Shape of Water"" and get lost in one of the year's few films yearning to bring a little bit of older movie magic back into theaters. <br/><br/>~Steven C<br/><br/>Thanks for reading!

"StregaAsuka","8","34","62","28 January 2018"," The Shape of a Fairy Tale
","For once we are presented with a fabulous original fairy tale that is suited not only for children, but for adults too, and it is in this kind of stories that Guillermo del Toro is a master of the universe, without any doubt.<br/><br/>The story is set in the 50s in a secret facility where the government makes experiments and also pursues some investigations. We are presented with the main character, Elisa; a mute woman who works as a cleaner and who one day, while cleaning a room with her colleague and friend, meets a creature that will change her life forever. Yes, it sounds like the typical fairy tale, and this is indeed a fairy tale, but as always, what is important is the way it is told because that it what makes a difference and this one, this movie, it told in the most pure and fantastic of ways.<br/><br/>We are used to the magnificent visuals that Mr del Toro always provides, and in this one he doesn't let us down. The visuals are simply fabulous: from how the creature is made, to the contrast of colours through the whole movie. While blue is the dominant color of the movie (water is blue, don't forget), there are some brownish and reddish tonalities that simply complete the colour palette. Then, we have a delightful music that transports you to the water. Tt really feels like you are swimming there with the main characters, which is important, as when we are under water we tend to hear less that when we are on the surface, so here the music creates a surrounding atmosphere that isolates us from the rest. We don't care anymore about anything else.<br/><br/>But what would this movie be without its main actress? Sally Hawkins has a hard job, as she cannot use her voice to express what her character is feeling, but she has to do it all visually for the audience to comprehend. Needless to say, she is terrific in this role, she is the one that had to play this part, the best choice. Her work is even more highlighted with the help of the brilliant supporting actors that are Octavia Spencer, playing her colleague and friend, and giving some funny moments to us, and Michael Shannon playing the villain, which it always suits him and he never disappoints.<br/><br/>This is one of the best original movies of the last years, which have been filled with sequels, prequels, reboots, remakes, etc. It is a breath of fresh air for someone who is a bit tired of all this lack of imagination that is happening lately in Hollywood. A movie for everyone to enjoy and believe again in fairy tales, or to start believing if you didn't before."
"blanbrn","9","34","62","27 January 2018"," A beauty and the beast fairy tale of love, hope, and connection.
","Never really been a watcher of Guillermo del Toro movies, yet being a lover and liking movies that blend sci-fi and pay homage to classic monsters, I for sure had to check out this latest epic called ""The Shape of Water"". And this movie is a touching and moving film that's a blend of drama, romance, and adventure fantasy.<br/><br/>Set in the late 1950's early 1960's in Baltimore at a top notch government research lab this movie becomes a journey of escape and a journey of connection for two people who couldn't be more different. Sally Hawkins is Elisa a lonely and mute janitor who's only friends are her co worker Zelda(in a blunt and brash performance from Octavia Spencer)and her neighbor Giles(a wonderful Richard Jenkins). Plus Elisa puts up with verbal and mental abuse from her cold and mean boss Richard(the in groove Michael Shannon). However being alert and noticing things behind the scenes with eyes and ears pays off for Elisa.<br/><br/>Elisa slowly but surely begins a relationship of love and intimacy with a strange and mysterious sea like creature(something similar to the ""Creature from the Black Lagoon""). And aside from this the film becomes a drama of twists and turns a need for escape and survival and you ask questions who can and who do you trust?<br/><br/>Overall this movie is a great escape of connection and a journey to love and belonging proving that happiness is possible for lonely and different types of people. ""The Shape of Water"" is clearly one journey that's sentimental, emotional, and heart touching as the film will leave you touched and moved with love and wanting peace for all."

"gcsman","8","33","60","3 February 2018"," Impeccably produced and acted
","Guillermo del Toro is a master at the fantasy-romance genre and this one fits right in, despite the fact that it's put in an almost obsessively realistic 1960's period setting. In fact, it's halfway like a fairy tale (think: the Frog Prince). It's impeccably crafted and impeccably acted by a cast that's first rate from top to bottom. Sally Hawkins as the lead actress, the mute Elisa who works as a janitor in the secret research facility, is excellent but I think it's not fair to single her out at the expense of the others: Octavia Spencer, Richard Jenkins, Michael Shannon, and of course Doug Jones as the ""creature"" all get lots of screen time and are all totally convincing. <br/><br/>Another feature of the progress of the story that I liked was that the Amphibian Man -- which (check it out) is practically a double for the Creature From the Black Lagoon -- is revealed in his full form almost right from the start. The point, clearly, is not to score cheap horror points off his appearance, but to move right on to Elisa's unexplained fascination with him and their growing relationship.<br/><br/>The fairy-tale ending is both satisfying and yet oddly tragic. The main thing that keeps me from rating this unique film higher is, in a way, its greatest strength: It's pure, self contained storytelling with no links (or at least none that seem intentional) to anything outside itself. It's an absorbing world while we're in it, though."
"pedroquintaoo","8","33","60","12 January 2018"," Speechless
","I love the films directed by Guillermo del Toro, so I was waiting for The Shape of Water.
We follow the story of a woman who falls in love with a strange aquatic creature, during the 60s. We also have an amazing cinematography, a great cast and some good subplots full of metaphors about racism, homosexuality, patriotism and male chauvinism during that decade. That's one of the things I loved more.<br/><br/>I didn't hate anything about this movie, but there are some points that could be better, as: the main antagonist, he's just stupid and weak if I compare him with the sadistic and scary Captain Vidal from Pan's Labyrinth. I liked the main creature it but I missed the typical mystery and charisma that we can appreciate in some Del Toro's monsters.<br/><br/>The Shape of Water isn't the best movie from one of the most amazing directors of all time, but stills good and perhaps one of the best movies of the year.<br/><br/>Rating 7.5/10"

","I enjoyed the movie thoroughly. I find that is difficult to sit through Oscar bait after a long day at work but I sat in my chair without interruption. <br/><br/>The soundtrack was phenomenal. It was the first attribute of the film that I noticed. It felt like stepping through a wormhole and going to the 1960's. Every detail was so well done. From a man battling with his own sexuality in a society where this has caused him to lose his job and his friends, to the racist remarks from the pie serving prick, del Torro depicts the era with flawless determination.<br/><br/>I also feel like the relationship between the asset and Elisa develops swiftly and could have developed as the movie progressed. The sexuality between them should have been implied. The relationship became weird for some once the vulgarity of mating with a completely different species sets in.

"themovieparadise","8","33","60","24 December 2017"," Another Beautifully Visual-Driven Film from Guillermo del Toro
","One of the most impressive parts of The Shape of Water will probably go unstated by many, because it is easy to overlook. It is stunning how much chemistry a woman who never talks and a fish monster can have. The energy between them radiates, and I had to keep stopping myself to consciously think about what a feat that truly is. As a direct result to how great the writing, directing, and performances are, this relationship between a woman and a monster never feels strange. If done by lesser talent, this could have come across as very weird or wrong. But del Toro crafts this film in such a way that it never comes across in this manner. In fact, in feels only natural, and that is applause-worthy on his part. That is the single biggest thing that Del Toro needed to pull off flawlessly, and he rises to meet the challenge. As with every Guillermo del Toro movie, the production elements are all spectacular. Del Toro really has a great understanding of mise-en-scène, something I'm continuously taken aback by every time I watch a movie of his. His cinematography isn't usually something that lunges out at you and calls attention to itself; rather, it works to very subtly draw you into the film. I do very much like cinematography that stands out and pops, but there is also something to be said for more the subtle kind of shooting a film. Del Toro has a strong hold on his production design. From the set design to the costume design to the color palette, every del Toro movie has a clear direction that is unique to its own story, and this film is no exception..."

"chestern-80136","9","32","58","25 February 2018"," A surreal fairytale that's far more effective than it should be.
","This film is quite special for me. It's the first film (aside from standard Marvel/Star Wars etc. films) that I've actually been excited for, and anxiously awaiting it's release. Since it came out in America first, I also heard how good many people thought it was.<br/><br/>Now, I haven't watched nearly as much of Guillermo Del Toro's work as I would have liked, and that's something i'm working to change, but I've enjoyed everything I've seen that he was linked to. This is the first of his works that I've seen in the cinema, and at this rate, he may end up as one of my favourite directors. Everything he does has tremendous style, whether it's a surreal 1960s romance featuring a fish man, or monoliths of metal and monsters clashing. Of course, The Shape of Water looks gorgeous despite it's relatively small budget of 19 million dollars. Despite how much I enjoyed Black Panther, TSoW had a budget 1/10th of the size and in my opinion, looked better. The creature effects were brilliant, and Del Toro captured the feel of the setting wonderfully. <br/><br/>The music was quite gorgeous, and fit the setting remarkably. The soundtrack sounds like songs you might have heard at the time. It also captures much of the morbid whimsy the film holds throughout.<br/><br/>Speaking of morbidity, I was surprised by the violence throughout the film. Despite my excitement for it's release, I'd never actually noted it's rating. I'd assumed it to be a PG-13 or something of the sort, but it holds (and earns) a hard R rating. The gore was almost distractingly good, and depending on the scene somebody watches, they could be forgiven for thinking they were watching a horror film.<br/><br/>Surprisingly, I enjoyed every performance in the film. Sally Hawkins made good on a tremendous task; her character Elisa is mute throughout the film, and as a result, all of ehr acting must be done through body language and facial expression. This fact, coupled with the older setting, often reminded me of the classic silent films. Octavia Spencer also does wonderfully, and the duo have great chemistry despite the lack of words between the pair. Richard Jenkins also brought some much needed levity to many situations, while Michael Shannon gave our antagonist legitimate vulnerability, keeping him from remaining a simple, bland villain.<br/><br/>Every character is interesting in their own way, and it's quite interesting seeing how this group of outcasts interacts with one another all throughout. There is a mute woman, a black lady, a gay gentleman, a Russian spy and a literal fishman, yet they all feel more human than our villain, despite how the world of the film may portray them.<br/><br/>The plot, for the most part, is rather odd though I imagine this was intentional. The whole film feels rather akin to a fairytale, albeit a far more mature one with nudity and blood. Many times throughout the film, I felt extremely uncomfortable, though I feel this was the intended reaction; it really added to the scene, and the film overall. Even though I could tell the vague direction of the plot from the trailer alone, I wasn't at all disappointed after watching the film. The journey to the destination was far more important in this instance. I imagine you could even watch this film chopped up and reassembled in the wrong order; it looks simply gorgeous.<br/><br/>Though, of course, I may be biased due to how excited I was for this film, I struggle to find many flaws with it. It just seems to have clicked with me, and at the risk of rating two films extremely highly right next to each other, I shall give this film a 9.5/10, especially due to it's budget. I don't give it a 10 simply due to a few moments which didn't land for me, personally."
"tmpsvita","9","32","58","18 February 2018"," A masterpiece signed by Del Toro
","After his, in my opinion very good, horror ""Crimson Peak"", Guillermo Del Toro returns completely changing genre going to the romantic with fantasy background.
Certainly it changes genre but not style and in fact from the first shots you immediately recognize the unmistakable artistic and stylistic approach of the famous Mexican director. A coherent, fascinating and always disturbing, in some respects, style.
In this case, however, he exceeds himself and creates a visually monumental and cinematographically sublime work. The film is simply a real beauty for the eyes, for the soul and for the heart.
All this thanks to the extraordinary images that Dan Laustsen's cinematography (Crimson Peak, John Wick 2) exalts and decorates with surreal colors tending to aquamarine (not by chance color that recalls the main element of the film) and a sweet lighting, a truly wonderful cinematography; and that the intimate and meticulous direction of Del Toro manages to frame with precision, passion and a lot of personality.
A director who proves to be quite explicit in several scenes, it comes to say almost brave, in fact in some scenes Guillermo Del Toro is not afraid to frame bodies, however pure, naked; this would seem to go against the extreme delicacy and incredible romanticism with which the whole film is characterized, but this is perfectly inserted in the aforementioned context, thus succeeding in showing, as it should be, this wonderful love in the best of the its Shape.
The wonderful images are transformed into exciting sequences and linked to each other through a dynamic and intelligent editing that uses small escamotage (like two drops of water on a window) to surprise the viewer already completely immersed in the film.
Thanks to the great skill of Del Toro you can not not be immersed in this beautiful story (similar to that of ""Beauty and the Beast"") and not even be overwhelmed by this love; had been made by someone else probably the effect would have been contrary, namely disgust and misunderstanding but in this case instead of doing this, instead of discriminating this love, you can not but desire it. 
Thanks mainly, not only to the director, but also to the indisputable skill of Sally Hawkins, first of all, of Octavia Spencer, perfect for the role entrusted to her, and of Richard Jenkins (all three nominated for an Oscar); fundamental was also the interpretation of Doug Jones who managed to make the ""amphibious man"" credible and appreciable.
Also helped by a good makeup despite some scenes in which the presence of a costumes is perceptible.
The soundtrack is also beautiful.
Less good is the screenplay (also nominated by the Academy Awards) that, despite its objective quality, can not give to the public unforgettable dialogues as, instead, it is all the rest."
"eagandersongil","9","32","58","16 February 2018"," A brutal novel that transcends languages and moral
","A film that goes from the playful French play ""the fabulous destiny of Amélie Poulain"" to the Japanese trash ""Guinea Ping"". A film of immersion and construction of impeccable characters. Guilherme Del Toro builds a plot with several narrative mirrors to the ""labyrinth of the faun"", a fairy tale that blends the brutality of human nature, a conjecture about love. hatred, depression and self-assertion. The screenplay for ""La forma da Agua"" tells us a bizarre, gothic love story that brings with it a series of characteristics, which are supported by its many and fabulous characters, which for me is the high point of script, the construction of characters, we have a character in search of love and its counterpoint, the one that is already sick of love, we have characters in search of self discovery, and in contrast, a character who has already discovered himself, and why , must be self-affirming. That is, the romance between a woman and a sea creature is only an excuse to explore and unite the most diverse human feelings and anguishes, and even this novel being diminished in my text in the film, it is absurdly explored, from this solitude and abstinence lived by the character of Sally Hawkins that ends up triggering in her a curiosity to the new, and even the fact that it is mute, this creates a bond with the creature, and leaves the scenes very the most beautiful because we have only the visual resource to contemplate the passion of the two, passion that transcends morality or language, is only one character completing the emptiness of the other and communicating through the universal language of love, Romantic too? may be, because the whole movie behaves like a French novel of the 90s, with some small shocks of reality, we can not fail to mention how much the dialogues are sharp and very clever. The moral of the film is really talking about the peculiarities of its characters, that although the world was in the 60s, the most primitive human feelings still stood out, and people, even the ""Villains"" had their dramas, because the Michael Shannon's character is completely broken, he's a villain who needs to stay down every second self-asserting, that leaves him completely meticulous and scary, yet human. Technically the film is impeccable, with a palette of greenish colors, an edition that cadenza well the rhythm of the film, great edition and sound mixing, besides an enviable production design and impeccable costumes and a soundtrack that strolls through songs of the years 40,50,60 always in a light way that combines a lot with the film and makes the viewer fall in love with Del Toro's feature film. Guilherme Del Toro, alias, who can win his first Oscar, the fabulous director directs a film almost completely perfect, showing that ""The Labyrinth of Fauno"" was not only luck but the competence of the Mexican director, who enchants with his monsters, script and technique, although I think that ""Labyrinth Do Fauno"" is still his masterpiece, but ""The form of Aguá"" is the film that will open the director's quality to the world. All the actors in the film are spectacularly great, Sally Hawkins, Octavia Spencer and Richard Jenkins make a perfect trio of performances, and all of them were very well rewarded for their great performances, but I wanted to mention also Michael Shannon, who even a little forgotten in awards, looks great in his role, the actor has a magnificent screen presence. The film only ends in its act of completion, the film ends at the wrong time, and we do not have the dualism between real and ludic that I expected, in addition to the film little explore the drama of Michael Stuhlbarg, finally, ""The form of Water"" is one of the great films of 2018, is a work indispensable to the lovers of cinema."

Marked by dark shadows and moody lighting, the film has a distinct noir feel. Yet punctuating the aesthetic gloom is a story brimming with light and indefatigable charm. It's del Toro's most sophisticated work to date, a master-class in mood setting and emotionally affecting filmmaking, even if it feels a little too self-satisfied at times.<br/><br/>The story follows Eliza (Sally Hawkins), a mute janitor who feels ""incomplete"". She lives in a quaint apartment atop of a movie theatre and spends her days as a cleaner in a top-secret government facility. There she falls in love with an amphibious fish-like being (Doug Jones) who is imprisoned by the government and subject to cruel studies and experiments. Taken aback by the way the creature sees her for what she is, not what she isn't, she falls in love and conspires with her co-worker (Octavia Spencer) and neighbour (Richard Jenkins) to break the creature out.<br/><br/>Once the love story takes shape, it doesn't deviate from the expected. Del Toro seems less interested in developing a complex narrative but rather providing depth through the film's mise-en-scene. While, at times, this makes the story feel a little stagnant and complacent, del Toro is nothing if not a distinct visual stylist. Set in 1962 Baltimore, the quintessential Americana setting is juxtaposed with French styled influences. The film's whimsical elements feel like del Toro channelling the work of Jean-Pierre Jeunet, with the music, quirky characters, quaint sets and surreal slant all trademarks of Jeunet's work. The film is a celebration of cinema just as much as it is about the power of imagination. It's a joy to behold and a latter half homage to Fred Astaire, by way of standout musical number, is one of the many inspired choices throughout the film.<br/><br/>What allows the narrative to flourish, however, is Sally Hawkins' emotionally charged performance. She is able to communicate a wealth of emotion without uttering a single word. Her delicate and understated performance anchors the fanciful story and provides nuance to the central romance between Eliza and the creature. The companionship they share is one of deep humanity and, in a world too quick to judge, Hawkins' layered performance ensures their relationship never feels unbelievable. <br/><br/>The Shape of Water is ultimately a story about the importance of communication and understanding at a time when otherness was seen as threatening and unwelcome. The parallels to the present day are not hard to draw and while the story plays it a little safe, del Toro paints it with a tenderness few artists achieve. The purity of vision on display is the work of master auteur and something seen far too rare these days. The Shape of Water is a classic love story, told with modern relevance and truly a tale for our troubled times."

","I never had the intentions of watching this film, but to my surprise I thoroughly enjoyed the film And it is a film worth watching. Without spoiling anything here is a film that gives you a realization of a world we live in. The one question that echoed through the film was ""Who am I?"" It is a story of love with a humanoid creature and a human being. They touch on subjects of mistreatment simply because someone or something is different. The film makes an emphasis on how it doesn't matter who we are on the inside or what we look like on the outside it's that your feelings are true to yourself. The character arc of the Amphibian Man is a seat clincher one moment you're scared he's going to bite and the next you're hoping he does bite. It is amazing how much can be said by a character who uses sign language to speak. It is an honest film that even if you aren't there for the the story it is a pleasure enjoying the music and the art that it is."

"Mohican15","8","31","56","7 March 2018"," One Of The Best Of 2018!
","To paraphrase one of this film's quotes: ""If I told you about THE FILM what would I say?' It's beautiful, enchanting, moving, gripping but it's also strange and quite odd, like some brilliantly bizarre poem. However, the really great thing about THE SHAPE OF WATER, as well as the acting and script is how fresh and new it is. It REALLY IS something you don't see everyday. The concept, story and delivery really dazzle. The scope is awe-inspiring and this film has certainly earned it's Oscar in my opinion. <br/><br/>Director Guillermo Del Toro has TOTALLY delivered with this movie in both his writing and directing. The script is genius frankly, smart, sharp and very original (whatever some say). We get a deep and emotional look at each character and each story. Though the film is obviously about Elisa (Sally Hawkins) and her romance with the Amphibian Man (Doug Jones), this film has many backstories and additional plot lines, and the film becomes brilliantly and complexly multi-layered. Del Toro directs brilliantly too, getting the uttermost from his stellar cast, but also grafting a brilliant and authentic 60s world. GREEN is something that features almost everywhere: the walls, the floor, the water, the food, and of course the Amphibian Man himself. The visual effects in this film are pretty much second-to-none (except BLADE RUNNER 2049) and the animated Amphibian Man is beautiful and vibrant, like a great painting. <br/><br/>Now, onto the story. The plot is simple and uncomplicated but still grips and makes you feel for the characters. It is also authentic to the attitudes and paranoia of the times with racism, homophobia, sexism and the ""Red Scare"", all portrayed unapologetically. However, the main event of course is Elisa and her peculiarly amorous relationship with the Amphibian Man. Many people have said that the film's concept is rather creepy and weird and I must admit I was a little skeptical about the spectacle of a woman falling in (and making) love to a fish man, but the romance is told in such a beautiful and graceful way that you end up not minding at all. I WAS, however, rather glad that their love life was not explored too graphically. Almost as soon the two met I was rooting for them. I felt pity for Amphibian Man and the brutal way in which he was treated but I also fell in love with Elisa ""the princess without voice"". The only problem was, (and call me a cynic) I didn't get the emotional connection from their romance that I would get from that of a man and a woman. I DID care about their romance but it wasn't the same as the romance between human people. <br/><br/>I should warn that this film is bloodily violent at times and may shock, it's certainly not some kid's fairy tale... <br/><br/>However, the whole story was of course carried by the cast and I have (as usual) chosen a few standouts (4 to be precise): Sally Hawkins, Michael Shannon, Octavia Spencer and Richard Jenkins. Hawkins was BRILLIANT! Totally different to what we know her for (PADDINGTON anyone?) as Elisa, the mute heroine. Hawkins gives such a convincing and strong performance and though her character can't speak, we still know exactly what she's thinking. Hawkins facial expressions are portraits of pain, sorrow, joy and raw emotion and Elisa becomes a heroine you can TOTALLY fall in love with. Richard Jenkins is also brilliant as Giles, a repressed homosexual and a real father figure to Elisa. He's emotional, a little vain but charming and Jenkins character is one you can really grow fond of. Octavia Spencer certainly earns her Bafta as Elisa's friend and confidant Zelda. She's a strong, independent woman, putting on a brave face for all the racism she suffers, but she has a very emotional centre and Spencer really does the character justice. Michael Shannon is monstrously magnificent as Mr. Strickland. Unfeeling and uncaring, he's a brutal villain you grow to hate as he brutalises the creature and terrifies other characters, driven with a powerhouse performance by Shannon.<br/><br/>The charming vintage soundtrack and gorgeous dream sequences along with all of the above, REALLY moved the film along to it's tense ending. Del Toro ties it up beautifully, like a classic fairytale romance with a twist. <br/><br/>As always, I ask myself, did I enjoy it? Yes! I really did enjoy THE SHAPE OF WATER. The cast was outstanding, the story was brilliantly strange and fresh, but most of all the film delivered and really deserves it's Oscar (and even my Dad enjoyed it)..."

Cinematography is amazing and the story itself is quite beautiful. For me - it's almost perfect.<br/><br/>The only reason I'm giving it an 8 and not a 10 is because there's a moment in the movie where the creature kills and eats a kitten, and that image is burned in my brain and had kinda ruined the movie for me. By the time the film is over you kinda get over it, but for me - that was one thing I can't watch, as a person who owns a cat and grew up with cats, was a bit too sickening of an image and now when I think of this film that's the image that pops up, which is a shame.

"laishramrastogee","9","31","56","2 March 2018"," A guide to love by Del Toro
","To be honest i ll watch anything Guillermo del Toro makes because he defines for me what love is or what love can do. He shows most inhuman, alien, or beastly creatures are capable of love if you have the eye and heart for it. The creatures that he create and to mold them to life with so much detail and to have a backstory is the kind of work only del Toro can accomplish. I fell in love with the genre of horror solely because of him for he makes you see beneath the fear of the ""other side"" ...their perspective sometimes makes you cry. 
Coming to the movie, its an ordinary a girl meets boy genre and ofcourse with a fairy tale ending but what separates this movie apart from the normal rom-com genre is the brilliant cinematography and music editing specially with the bus scene with Hawkins running her fingers on the water on the mirror and the music cut at perfect timing!! Next is that Frank Sinatra scene on the stage with two of them dancing, it was suppose to be make one laugh but it made me cry... because we all know that somewhere how stupid it may seem we long for it. Then again cut scene from singing back to mute translation looked smoothly done . With actors such as Hawkins, Stuhlbarg , Shannon, Jenkins, Jones, and Spencer the movie was simple yet so beautifully crafted yes the word is CRAFTED!

","The Shape of Water is a bizarre but comforting, romantic and even sexy movie -- ""less a movie than a conjuring"" per one critic. I'm not a fan of monster movies, but this one is less about a monster than about myth, imagination, and connection. I'm sure it also holds far more references than I noticed, from the mute named Eliza (though the cast list spells it Elisa) to a Dr Strangelove persona, and many references to other monsters. It's also about color palettes, shifting dramatically through browns and golds and shades of blue and green."
"jeremychan-63517","8","31","56","20 February 2018"," Magical, romantic masterpiece
","Shape of water , a romantic masterpiece created by infamous director of Hell boy, Pacific rim - Guillermo Del Toro. He has been known for his unique style of filming, creating his imaginative character into perfection without using CGI,but make up instead, so do the 'The shape of Water'. <br/><br/>The story itself is so romantic that the audience may completely immersed themselves into the movie. The tension within the storyline may gradually build up alongside the depth of the character. Eliza Esposito,a muted character portrayed by Sally Hawkins, has a desperate keen of love. Her love at first sight with the amphibian man may be well illustrate through their intimate interactions in the movie, and may be well embellished on top of their sign language, which leaves the story emotionally engaging with the audience. The starting and the ending also may be related through the drop of the shoe, which leaves the story ending in circle - Guillermo's unique style of storytelling. <br/><br/>Besides, the lighting and the music of 'the shape of water' is the main tools for creating the romantic atmosphere for the movie. Dan Lausten, best known by his cinematography in John Wick, Silent hill has done an astounding job in Shape of Water. His usage of Colour, and natural lighting creates a stupendous visual sensation for the audience. The shadows of the light, reflections of the water, or the use of contrast, generate a really warm tone which melt the ice out of the audience's heart.Foer the music aspect, Alexandra Desplat has just won the BAFTA awards for the best film music for his work in shape of water, but that comes with a reason The music mainly comes from the golden age of Hollywood , the 50s or the 60s. The music piece in shape of water may naturally blend in with the visual telling and the tone of the movie, creating a romantic sensational feeling. Especially when listening to the piece' The shape of Water', you may feel yourself submerging into the water, with the bubbles flying up to the water surface, and the whistling creating a peaceful feeling, which is the most magical aspect of the music piece. <br/><br/>Shape of water, may be regarded as the film of the year. Highly recommended to Watch with your love one."

"mtmiller-08343","10","31","56","4 February 2018"," A Beautiful Other-Worldly Romance
","I just watched this film today and I already adore it. It's a beautiful film that celebrates the magic of movies and fairytales while simultaneously subverting all of the genre's norms.<br/><br/>The center of any movie is it's performances and this has some of this years best. The core is the romance between Sally Hawkins as Elisa Esposito and Doug Jones as the Amphibian. While the story of an interspecies romance may be a turn-off for some people, don't judge it by it's strange concept. Sally Hawkins is mute for the entire film, forcing her to show her emotion through her expressions and motions. And she brings so much emotion to the role. Whether showing the loneliness of her normal routine as a janitor at a secret government facility, her joy as she dances to music on the TV, and her curiosity when first meeting the Amphibian, it's all imbued with an earnestness hard to fake. And Doug Jones gives an equally silently emotive performance. He takes what could be a hulking brute and makes him a scared, confused being that finds a kindred spirit in Elisa. <br/><br/>While the heart of the movie is Elisa and the Amphibian's, the supporting performances are equally heartfelt. My personal favorite performance of the film is Richard Jenkins as Giles. He is Elisa's neighbor, translator, and best friend. His moments with Elisa are purely wonderful, whether eating pie, listening to music, or breaking a South American water creature out of a government facility. And, as we learn, he's also a closeted gay man. There are a couple of brilliant scenes that show his challenges and motivation to help Elisa. Another incredible addition is Octavia Spencer as Zelda Fuller. She is one of Elisa's coworkers. She discovers the creature with her and goes from being wary of the beast to aiding Elisa in its escape. She brings humor, wit, and warmth to the role. On the other hand, there is Michael Shannon as government agent Richard Strickland. If you were to rate villains in how much you grow to despise them, he would be one of the best in recent memory. He's egotistical, hateful, and violent. Michael Shannon brings a cold ruthlessness to the role which imbues every one of his scenes with tension. And finally there is Michael Stuhlbarg, a scientist and Soviet double agent. In what could have been a one sided portrayal that fell back on overused tropes, he brings a layered character who decides to put science before country. <br/><br/>Moving away from the performances, I'd like to focus more on the creative side, which is mainly the vision of one man, Guillermo del Torro. The script pays homage to everything from fairytales to monster movies to spy thrillers. It is tender, surprising, tense, and wonderfully strange in a way only del Torro could conceive. And the direction combines all of the formerly mentioned homages into a beautiful direction that creates memorable visuals that will stay with you far after the end credits.<br/><br/>On top of the direction, the visual effects are beautiful as well, especially in regards to the Amphibian. If I didn't know any better, I would have thought that they really cast a fish actor. There is never a scene where he seems fake, a feat few big budget blockbusters can achieve. <br/><br/>I decided to write this review not just because I feel very passionately about this film, but to right the wrongs I see in many negative reviews. A big complaint I've seen is about the interspecies relationship. While the film is very sexual, it is done in a very tasteful and gentle way. I find it done much better than a lot of films, especially a certain series named after shades of colors.<br/><br/>In the end, the film is less about a romance between a woman and a fish, but a story of marginalized people coming together and finding each other. Look past the initial strangeness and you'll find a beautiful and truly unique film that must be seen, preferably in theaters."

"joshbarton15","10","31","56","16 January 2018"," It's a love story but not as we know it...
","Guillermo del Toro is a visionary filmmaker who has enchanted us over the years with films that centre around the fantasy and horror genre he has such a keen eye for. Whether it be the beautifully crafted Pan's Labyrinth or Pacific Rim, where the designs for the Kaiju were the stand-out, del Toro has blended such fantastical elements into a wide genre of films. His latest, The Shape of Water maintains such a bountiful filmmaking choice and then some.<br/><br/>Elisa Esposito (Sally Hawkins) is a mute janitor working in top secret research facility in the 1960s. When she stumbles upon an amphibious creature being held captive for research, Elisa forms a unique bond with the creature, leading to an escape attempt and a love story quite unlike anything we've ever seen before.<br/><br/>The Shape of Water is del Toro's first foray into a proper love story and the results are utterly spellbinding, his direction allowing the gentle nature of this relationship feel much more believable than if it was done with a heavy hand and his writing, along with Vanessa Taylor, offering the audience sheer escapism in romance, espionage and subtle comedy.<br/><br/>The all-round craft of The Shape of Water really is something to behold; Paul D. Austerberry's intricate and gorgeously detailed production design providing such a wonderful backdrop, Dan Laustsen's cinematography beautifully encapsulating the bond between the lovers and Alexandre Desplat's majestic score accentuating the fantasy element to proceedings. Expect all three to be major contenders at the Academy Awards.<br/><br/>Coming to the performances, The Shape of Water is full of such vastly different performances, all coming together to deliver such an immensely satisfying viewing experience. Sally Hawkins is outstanding as Elisa, spending the near entirety of the film evoking emotion through her body language and expressions, making her such a great character in the process. Richard Jenkins is delightful as Giles, Elisa's best friend, his comedic timing being put to great use here and Michael Shannon is expectedly great as Colonel Richard Strickland, the villain of the piece. The screen presence Shannon has is just ridiculous, lighting up the screen whenever he appears so it's good to see him collaborate with such a filmmaker as del Toro.<br/><br/>The Shape of Water is a mesmerising tale of romance for the ages, Guillermo del Toro cementing his place in history as one of the most special filmmakers ever to have graced the silver screen with such a delicate masterpiece."
"junkinstuff","8","44","83","22 March 2018"," I loved this movie

"PyroSikTh","8","30","54","20 February 2018"," A Beautiful Romantic Fantasy that could've gone Terribly.
","Imagine Creature from the Black Lagoon as a Romance. Elisa is a mute cleaner at a government facility who becomes enchanted by the latest addition to the facility's roster; an Amphibian Man caught in South America and hauled all the way up to America by a government agent called Strickland, who seeks to exploit the creature to get one up on the Russians in the height of the Cold War. As the movie goes on, Elisa and her friends break the Amphibian Man out to save it from certain death, and an oddball romance blossoms between the two. Yes, it's a concept that sounds completely terrible on paper, and yet Del Toro manages to craft a beautiful and moving film out of it.<br/><br/>Being a Del Toro movie, The Shape of Water is not safe by any means (I mean, the entire concept of a woman falling in love with a sea creature is a pretty big hint). One of the opening montages shows Elisa in full-frontal nudity pleasuring herself in the bath, showing that the movie is not afraid of the sexual connotations, and is in fact willing to embrace them, without being titilising. Similarly, it's not afraid to show the more graphic and gorier aspects of bringing a sea creature home to a house full of cats. While it is maybe a little tame compared to Del Toro's previous works, it still feels fundamentally like the only thing Del Toro could craft. He manages to include the more graphic and risky moments that makes the film feel real, without losing it's fairytale, fantasy leanings. The sexuality doesn't undercut the romance, and the gore doesn't undercut the beauty or the film's themes.<br/><br/>On the note of themes, The Shape of Water is rife with them. It's a story about misfits and the loneliness they endure because of it. Elisa is mute which makes her easy to ostracise. She struggles without meaningful companionship, and on the entire cleaning staff only has one friend; Zelda. Zelda is a fairly normal person beyond her skin colour. Being black in the early 60s wasn't an especially kind time, and neither is being a woman, and she suffers both racism and sexism daily. Elisa's other friend is her neighbour Giles, who is not only an old man watching his youth fade away, concealing it with tupées, but is also gay in a time when it's not acceptable, and suffers similar rejections to companionship that Elisa does. The Amphibian Man goes without saying.<br/><br/>Another theme is that of masks, or hiding who you truly are. Strickland, on the outside, is a successful family man complete with two kids, nice house, cadillac, smart suits, and a wife who beckons to him, but on the inside he's racist, sexist, fetishes the silence of women (both literally and figuratively), and the threat of losing gradually tears him apart. Doctor Hoffstetler, the main scientist on the project is a covert Russian spy tasked with ensuring the Americans don't gleam more from the Amphibian Man than them. Yet his deception is twofold, as he doesn't even work unquestioningly for the Russians. He has too much of a scientific curiousity of the Amphibian Man, caring for it in his own way, and ultimately helping Elisa to break him free. Then of course there's Giles masking his age with a tupée. Elisa's mask is much more subtle, and unknown even to her.<br/><br/>Each character is played with depth and nuance by each cast member, and there's absolutely no weak links. Michael Shannon does what he does best as the menacing antagonist who's slowly falling apart himself. A quintessentially masculine man who ultimately can't keep up the charade. Michaul Stuhlbarg plays Hoffstetler with an empathy that makes his character much softer than I imagine he would have appeared on the page. Octavia Spencer, like Shannon, does what she does best as a middle-aged, working class black woman brought down by her homelife and her environment. Richard Jenkins is pretty killer as Giles, tapping into his sensitive side with such finesse that what could otherwise have felt like a pretty cliché gay character instead is filled with depth and charm.<br/><br/>Of course the real power house is Sally Hawkins who is as fantastic as always as Elisa. Without saying a word, she manages to convey such an emotional depth that will make her the envy of her colleagues. One scene in particular has her appealing to Giles affection for her, to get him to help her break the Amphibian Man out. It's one of those scenes that would be a career-defining monologue in any other movie, but of course in Shape of Water it is done without dialogue, and instead conveyed almost entirely in sign language and body language, and Sally Hawkins kills it. The fluency and conviction with which she performs is captivating to watch, and it's hard not to get invested in Elisa's plight.<br/><br/>On a more technical standpoint The Shape of Water doesn't fail to deliver either, at least not for the most part. The general aesthetic of the movie is like that of the 50s and 60s, but painted in such a way that gives it an oddly fantastical edge. I've seen it compared to the video game Bioshock, which feels like an accurate comparison. There are a number of shots that feel like paintings. However what makes each shot look so good and enthralling is the sharp lighting with harsh brights and shadows, which can make the film feel a little dark (but then again, it's Del Toro, and it still looks great). The score by Alexandre Desplat is also really good, with a memorable theme.<br/><br/>But on the note of music strikes my only real complaint with the movie. There's one scene that should've been a hugely powerful glimpse into Elisa's desires, but it decides to portray this by shifting to black and white and giving us a musical number. Maybe I'm biased because I hate musicals (at least ones that aren't family films), but I never find random musical numbers in otherwise fairly serious movies ever work, and The Shape of Water is no exception. It's jarring, doesn't feel particularly well done (especially compared to the rest of the movie), and the emotions it wants to portray could've been done much better another way. It's a bold move, and thematically fits, so for that I give Del Toro kudos, but it just felt a little tacked-on and unnecessary, breaking the movie's pace for a brief extravagance.<br/><br/>The Shape of Water is ultimately a very beautiful movie though, there's no denying that. It toes the line of something that could've gone terribly wrong, but somehow Del Toro has managed to give us a romantic fantasy for the ages. I give it a high 8/10."

This movie is not a typical Hollywood movie that shows the same type of plot between the same type of people in the same type of society...In this particular piece of art you will find a very simple story containing people with little lives but with strong principles, self acknowledgement and self secure about the things they want in life.

","I cannot stress how much I recommend this movie. I'll be the first to acknowledge that I've been lukewarm about Guillermo Del Toro. I think I wrote in my review of 'Pacific Rim' that my favorite part of the movie was it's exposition. I am ready to eat crow and rightfully credit Del Toro as a master filmmaker. <br/><br/>In all honesty I had admired Del Toro most as a film buff and stand bearer of the legacy of the classic monster films we share a mutual love for. Unsurprisingly that is a large part of 'The Shape of Water' s magic. In his Golden Globe acceptance speech he thanked the great Lon Chaney as an inspiration. This is the closest I've seen to a Lon Chaney film. It is a story about different misfits tossed aside because they do not fit into a world's definition of beauty. <br/><br/>'The Shape of Water' takes a great deal of risks and skates very close to being thematically over the top but it remembers that at it's soul is a love story anchored by Oscar caliber performances from Sally Hawkins and Doug Jones. All the performances are excellent and all the characters extremely well developed. Michael Shannon turns in the best performance of an already stellar career.<br/><br/>It's a movie for our times too. Although not blatantly political one can't help but draw parallels between Shannon's character basking in an ultra nationalistic Cold War setting and the era of Trump. <br/><br/>And really what a relief to see a pulp fantasy project that is completely original but has sprinklings of inspiration. <br/><br/>These are just first impression notes but I loved it.

","The Shape of Water is absolutely enchanting. Filmmaking at its most bold and sterling fashion. In theory, the premise of a timid young woman having sexual relations with a humanoid sea monster sounds bizarre and cringeworthy, but Guillermo del Toro's dark and extravagant craft has you see more of the beauty and elegance in the situation other than the disturbing nature. Sally Hawkins' delivers a silent yet spirited leading performance that effectively fuels the emotional and alluring moments surrounding her and the monster. The Shape of Water is simply fascinating. A unique ""beauty and beast"" story. It is Del Toro's magnum opus. A wonder to behold. Best film of 2017."

","Take E.T., mash it up with the aesthetic sentiments of Amelie, throw in a dash of The Artist, top it all off with some amazingly open-minded attitudes toward bestiality and you have The shape of Water.<br/><br/>Elisa Esposito is a cleaner at a government facility where top secret projects are kept. Her life is pretty hum-drum until one day she meets a creature from the deep at work and gives him an egg. She instantly falls in love with the beastie and talks her bestie Giles, an aging artist with relationship problems of his own, into helping her mount a rescue. Along the way she receives initially reluctant assistance from her workmate, Zelda, as well as the help of a kind-hearted Soviet spy named Dimitri.<br/><br/>Visually, the movie is quite nice, the soundtrack was also very well chosen, but as a story the film seemed not to be able to make up its mind exactly what it wanted to be. The romance was rushed and never really felt believable, the best friend neighbor was only likeable sometimes, it seemed to want to make some sort of a social statement about male culture in the 50s, but this was only given, at best a superficial treatment; it kept toying with the idea of becoming a musical right up until it sort of did in a number that seemed as out-of-place, awkward and forced as the romance between Esposito and the creature from the deep.<br/><br/>All in all I'd say that this would be one of those films to watch with friends some night for a laugh, but don't expect much more than unintended comedy, as it's otherwise an utter mess."
"MrDHWong","8","53","102","18 January 2018"," After more than twenty years in the business, del Toro is still full of surprises
","The Shape of Water is a fantasy film starring Sally Hawkins, Michael Shannon, and Octavia Spencer. Directed and co-written by Guillermo del Toro (Hellboy, Pan's Labyrinth, Pacific Rim), it is an emotional story about friendship and a refreshing return to the fantasy genre from the veteran filmmaker.<br/><br/>In the early 1960s in Baltimore, Elisa Esposito (Sally Hawkins), a mute woman, works as a janitor at a top secret government laboratory run by Colonel Richard Strickland (Michael Shannon). One day, the lab receives a humanoid amphibian creature captured from a South American river. Over a period of time, Elisa forms a special bond with the creature and devises a plan to help it escape with her.<br/><br/>Visually stunning and poignant, The Shape of Water is exactly the type of film one would expect from Guillermo del Toro and shows that even after more than twenty years in the business, he is still full of surprises. Like Pan's Labyrinth, The Shape of Water feels like a fairy tale for adults, with its storybook-like tone and fantasy elements. The film is uniquely tailored to del Toro's style, as it likely would have been awkward and disturbing in the hands of any other filmmaker. Sally Hawkins was simply brilliant as the mute Elisa Esposito, considering she has no dialogue whatsoever and her acting is entirely visual. Michael Shannon was also great as Colonel Richard Strickland, a man who will stop at nothing to get what he wants.<br/><br/>I rate it 8/10"

","The Shape of Water was only released here in Australia only 2 days ago when it was basically a 2017 made film, but having seen it at long last we definitely think that this is one of this year's best films already (and only in the first month of a new year). The film tells the story of a lonesome mute cleaning woman named Lily, working at a contained facility that one day brings in a mysterious but valuable 'asset' that seems to get her interest when she sees the human sized creature. Determined to set it free after seeing it's captivity and treatment, she embraces to do so but manages to see that it is like her.<br/><br/>It's a fantasy romance story set in the era of the Cold War, with moments of drama, love and even thrills. The production value here is as great, beautiful and visually appealing as with any Del Toro film, the use of colours, practical makeup effects, storytelling, music, symbolism and even the themes are all taken to the levels of excellence to make it work perfect.
The acting is strong throughout with Sally Hawkins, Michael Shannon and the always great Richard Jenkins giving the best roles. Hawkins in particular embraces her character's mute with much detail and emotion, you feel and care for her as she discovers that even the most mysterious things in life can bring the best that life can offer, though there are consequences and rewards.
The Shape of Water is film that will indeed have your mind and heart set to it and will make you imagine a world where fantasy and love are alive. With award worthy values in direction, production design, script and great performances, this reminds us that films can still capture the magic.

","Del Toro has blurred the lines between traditional genres and, thus, has created his very own unique genre. For this reason, it is very difficult to compare ""The Shape of Water"" with any other film. Additionally, this film will most likely not be enjoyed by a traditional, squared minded audience who will probably just consider it as weird. On the other hand, it will most certainly be enjoyed by an imaginative, openminded audience who is tired of traditional films, and understands the struggle for love in the dark and divisive times we live in."

If you enjoyed Guillermo del Toro's masterpiece Pans Labyrinth I think you'll enjoy this movie.
It's fantasy, nostalgia and suspense told as an adult fairytale.
Superb performance by one of my favourite actresses Sally Hawkins , did you see her in Maudie now that's the movie I think she should have won an Academy award for but she's one of the favourites this year and roles where actors play handicapped characters that are deaf, mute, or blind usually win Academy awards.
A great supporting cast including Octavia Spencer but i'll single out Michael Shannon as the most evil villain since The Queen in Snow White and Richard Jenkins ,nominated as best supporting actor well deservedly for his role of Giles the ""Good Queen ""in this Adult Fairytale.
I particularly loved the music by my favourite cinema composer of today
Alexander Desplat.

","The Shape of Water (2017): <br/><br/>I would say this is the kind of film that's more of an experience rather than a movie. Walking out of it, it feels like you just had a really beautiful, odd and emotional dream. <br/><br/>Now I'm gonna warn you right away, this isn't a movie for everyone, but I think if you're the right kind of person for it, you already know that you'll like it. It's very art-house, it's very Guillermo Del Toro, it's very weird. <br/><br/>Overall I really enjoyed ""The Shape of Water"", it leaves you with a good fuzzy feeling in your heart. I loved seeing every frame of it since Guillermo has a very distinctive and stylized look and tone. He manages to create a real world but with a dash of magic and fairy tale to it. The cinematography was absolutely astonishing (especially the colours), set design/costumes/etc were fantastic, the creature was really cool and pleasant to the eye (good mix of practical and CGI), the acting was good (even though the Russian was iffy). <br/><br/>My only problem with the movie was the fact that it felt a little too long, I think a couple of tiny things could've been cut here and there and the movie would've been just as good. There's also a couple of things that felt unaddressed but as the viewer you let it slide and forget about them since you're focused on the main story. <br/><br/>Basically, if you knew about this movie and you were interested in seeing it, see it. If you don't know anything about it or the works of Del Torro, probably don't. <br/><br/>If I had to boil it down (egg joke) to a score it would be somewhere around 7.5/10 <br/><br/>P/S<br/><br/>Do NOT see it with kids unless you want to have some VERY awkward moments."

"LegendsofHorror","10","26","46","7 March 2018"," Movie Review: The Shape of Water (2017)
","Guillermo del Toro is one of the greatest filmmakers of the past 20 years, his resume is nothing but amazing. Del Toro has written and directed so many cinematic greats ranging from his video game contributions to his TV and feature length films. <br/><br/>The Shape of Water is no different than his other amazing features. This film has been referenced as the ""unofficial"" sequel to ""The Creature from the Black Lagoon"" and this reviewer must agree. Visually and story wise this film is beautiful in every aspect. Del Toro nailed it with this film, it not only has the horror element but it also brings the romantic and dramatic element as well which appeases the cinephile in all of us. This film creates a time warp bringing the audience back into the 1960's by paying tribute to early Argento with the individual colour schemes, as well as bringing back the feel of the old school films that many nowadays have almost forgotten.<br/><br/>The acting in Del Toro's film have always been top notch, this film is no exception. The casting of this film is nothing short of amazing, starting with Sally Hawkins and Octavia Spencer who without this film couldn't have been a success that it was. Both women made Oscar winning performances, especially Ms. Hawkins who didn't speak a hardly a line of dialogue and alongside monster master Doug Jones made a truly romantic match in cinematic heaven. Richard Jenkins was also an amazing support cast member to this story. Michael Shannon could not have been cast better, he has such a way about bringing villains to life on the big screen. Shannon and Jones are such amazing actors and in my opinion should have gotten more screen time.<br/><br/>Everything down to the set decorations, the music, the cinematography couldn't have been better. This film was so much more than a monster movie...it was a romantic drama as well with a splash of the old school flare than many filmmakers nowadays have forgotten about.<br/><br/>If you haven't gotten a chance to see this film, do yourself a favour and buy this film on DVD or 4K I promise you, you won't regret it."

"PotassiumMan","8","26","46","10 December 2017"," Enchanting fantasy romance, full of wonder
","Although far from flawless, Del Toro's fantasy drama about a mute woman and her unexpected romance with a creature captured from the Amazon by the U.S. government is endearing and sad at the same time. It's a story about two members of divergent species who meet one another by chance and develop a romantic spark. These two beings come to find solace and bliss in each other's company in a world that is cold and heartless. It's a more modern spin on ""Beauty and the Beast"" and it's well worth seeing.<br/><br/>The biggest stumbling block the film has to overcome is a claustrophobic feeling that settles in after a certain point. The trailers made this look like a great adventure, but it's actually a desperate fight for survival against daunting odds, but one that is riveting. The film is beautifully shot, has a sterling throwback soundtrack and a beguiling storyline milieu. The creature itself is not depicted as a soft cuddly thing at all times, refreshingly. In some instances, it can be quite menacing. Del Toro's realization of this monster-cum-paramour is both wondrous and complex.<br/><br/>Sally Hawkins is utterly splendid as the mute woman who works in a smallish maintenance position at the government facility where the creature is quarantined. Michael Shannon is well-deployed as the government official who views the creature as nothing more than an experiment to be learned from. Michael Stuhlberg is also effective as one of the chief scientists at the lab. And Octavia Spencer, as always, is fun to watch here. The only weak link is Richard Jenkins as Hawkins' neighbor. There's something annoyingly saccharine about his performance and the film winds up having to overcome it, which it does.<br/><br/>There might be some larger metaphors in this film about race and religion, but I would leave that open to interpretation. This is a poignant story in its own right, and one that will stay with you, regardless of what else Del Toro might be trying to say. Gladly recommended."

","THE SHAPE OF WATER (2017) **** Sally Hawkins, Michael Shannon, Octavia Spencer, Richard Jenkins, Doug Jones, Michael Stuhlbarg, Nick Searcy, David Hewlett. 'The Creature From The Black Lagoon' meets 'Amelie' could've been the pitch for this romantic sci-fi offering from filmmaker Guillermo del Toro (who co-wrote with Vanessa Taylor) about a lonely, mute cleaning woman (Hawkins continuing to make smart decisions in a truly remarkable career thus far) for a top secret government lab circa 1962 where she finds an unlikely soulmate - an amphibious man-like creature (Jones doing wonders in motion capture ballet) that has been captured and taken from the swamps of South America to Baltimore for further observation and study. Del Toro balances fantasy, horror and genuine dramatic pathos wonderfully with dexterity in blending his odd couple into one amazing study of the concept of communication via love. Spencer adds strong and fun support as Hawkins' co-worker, BFF as well as Jenkins as her gay, commercial artist next-door neighbor but it is Shannon who stands out as the villainous and odious security lead to the operation whose racist, sexist, bullying jerk has subtle shades of grey bubbling underneath the surface - which best could also describe this superb film. Outstanding production design by Paul D. Austerberry, Nigel Churcher's varying hues of eerie and ethereally themed greens add punch with art direction, a sublimely romantic score by Alexander Desplat and handsome cinematography by Dan Laustsen prove a joint effort by all involved.

Taking place in the 1960's an amphibious creature with dynamite eyes that blink sideways!, has been captured to be experimented upon at a highly secure facility. A mute janitor, with pretty loose access to the heavily locked laboratory, sparks a relationship with the creature. They are alike in that they both have limited means for communication and oh yeah, she learns it really likes eating eggs. Will this strange relationship flourish? Will the men in charge allow this to continue? Will the creature ever be freed? The film's visual tone is bold and compliments the aquatic theme, had many dreamy scenes in water, the camera felt like it was ever-moving as if you were floating in water yourself and an endless rain plays into the water theme as well. Contributing to the overall strangeness were several odd and overt sexual innuendos that tie into the story. There were a few short moments of alarming blood and gore, which didn't seem to advance the story and felt jarring. Overall, this was top notch acting, visually memorable and a pleasant change from the norm."

","First of all ""The Shape of Water"" is beautiful and magical, a fairytale that is easy to enjoy and fall in love with. That much does not need you to look any further - an enchanting lovestory if ever I saw one, plain as day. <br/><br/>On second glance however it's small, humble scenery, this intimate dream we are invited to share, aims at something much, much more important. Something that may not even be about romance.<br/><br/>We all have, or at least had, ideals. Until we give up, or realize them. Thereby lofty ideals become firmly rooted in reality. Alas! more often than not high ideals become nothing but a facade in the process, a rallying banner used to pretend we'd still know what is what, how to be good, how to do the right thing, or why we became who we are to begin with. <br/><br/>For some the banner is ""christianity"", others advocate ""tolerance"" or one of a million other names we've given. What does that even mean? Perhaps we shouldn't swear? Perhaps it requires great strength? Perhaps there's the book telling right from wrong? Almost everybody genuinely tries to do the right thing, and so do this film's characters. Down to the overdrawn bad guy, each in his own fashion.<br/><br/>If you are open to it I am sure you'll feel what it is, what allows this wonderful film's protagonist to humbly walk that path. A path that all others use so much more power, knowledge and discipline to find and follow, yet fail."

","Another Guillermo del Toro masterpiece - story, screenplay (with Vanessa Taylor) and directed by - (Pan's Labyrinth, Pacific Rim, The Hobbit, Hellboy, Cronos, etc) deserves the Oscar he won for this fine and daring film. How this man is able to take imagination and make it so plausible is a gift - and one we can only hop he continues to share. <br/><br/>THE SHAPE OF WATER, an otherworldly fable set against the backdrop of Cold War era America circa 1962 opens windows on racial prejudice as played in that period, the constant threat or thought that everything evil must originate in Russia, the demeaning role of women, people with special disabilities and how they cope with them, and the cruelty of secret service police, tec. In the hidden high-security government laboratory where she works, lonely mute Elisa (Sally Hawkins) is trapped in a life of isolation, living with the artist Giles (Richard Jenkins). Elisa's life is changed forever when she and co-worker Zelda (Octavia Spencer) discover a secret classified experiment - an 'alien' amphibian man (Doug Jones) whose ability to be both water born and land born introduces fears of higher intelligence that must be a Russian plot. The cruel officer Michael Shannon Shannon), is assigned to destroy amphibian just as Dr. Robert Hofstetter (Michael Stuhlberg) is determined to protect him from the Russian underground. In the scurry of the secrecy Elisa befriends Amphibian Man and a curious and tender relationship is created between a mute woman and a creature unable to speak. <br/><br/>Odd references to old movies as shared by Giles and Elisa grow into a dramatic ending. Sally Hawkins is extraordinary as is the entire cast. Alexandre Desplat's musical score"
"austin0731","8","41","77","14 February 2018"," the sense of emptiness and the overwhelming sense of comfort
","The Shape of Water is Guillermo Del Toro's newest films, featuring amazing performances and stunning visuals. In comparison to many of Del Toro's other films there is a clear likeness in tone and visuals. However, in terms of depth in the narrative I would argue that The shape of Water exceeds many of Del Toro's other films by a long ways. <br/><br/>At first glance, The Shape of Water is certainly a great romance but I thought that Del Toro certainly manages to weave in a very interesting theme of emptiness and the need to fill the void with some form of comfort or object of desire and affection. I really enjoyed the way this was portrayed throughout the film almost physically symbolized by the presences of the Amphibian man. What I mean is the way in which the film portrays this gang of 'misfits' or somewhat outcasts of society and closely examines their characters, their flaws and the way in which they are seemingly filled by the creature. The two most obvious examples being Sally Hawkins' Elisa who is mute and falls in love with the creature due to the fact that she felt that the creature can see through her largest flaw: her disability. Whereas, Richard Jenkins' Giles also an outcast, an out of fashion artist in his old age who is lonely finds some sort of rejuvenation in the creature. <br/><br/>But, what is even more great is the fact that this theme is weaved into not only these characters but many others, Octavia Spencer's Zelda as an African American women facing racial prejudice and arguably most interestingly Michael Shannon's Richard Strickland and his relationship with the creature. I found that it was most fascinating to see that a character as such, living by the standards of the 'American life' with literal white picket fences, a loving wife and children having a very interesting rivalry with the creature. Somehow, their conflict stems from the fact that Richard some sort of superiority complex and the way in which the creature ties into his narrative as a sense of motivation almost fills his own lack of purpose in his suburban, stable lifestyle. <br/><br/>All of this was done magnificently with brilliant acting across the board along with tje aforementioned stunning visuals and a musical score that went so perfectly with the beautiful story that was unfolding."
"bigfrq","8","24","42","6 April 2018"," Really Cute!
","I enjoyed this film. I know its not a great as Pans Labyrinth but it is a cute love story. The actors put on a stellar performance I felt engaged and interested in the characters and wanted to see where the story went. The effects were also top notch and it was great to see so much of it was done practically because it added a nice layer of reality despite the fairy tale feel. However even if it is a nice love story between a mute lady and a fish man there is some very serious and bloody moments which is a nice contrast. So if you want to see a love story with some gritty elements go check it out."

","I'd never seen a Guillermo Del Toro movie before, but I'd heard of his movies and I was expecting an odd, fantastical film. ""The Shape of Water"" doesn't disappoint on that score, but I enjoyed the movie. The amphibious creature is very impressive. The movie makes you believe that the woman could fall for him. Octavia keeps it all real with her performance and earthy, snappy lines of dialogue. Michael Shannon gives his usual fine performance as the creature's cruel captor and keeper. His character is certainly ""over the top"" with his manner and cruelty. The sets are very impressive--the viewer is immersed in 1962 paranoid, cold war America. And of course the female lead actress deserves an Oscar for her portrayal of the mute janitor. She portrays so much emotion--love, desperation, kindness, anger--without a word. I will never be sure what motivates someone to write and direct such a story but congratulations to Mr. Del Toro!"

","A masterpiece of cinematography, with a magnificent love story even though it was weird and uncomfortable at moments. 
Despite all the weirdness, Guillermo Del Toro did make it look normal and natural even beautiful. The touches of homophobia, racism and woman Right were perfect. It was an outcry to society and a reminder of how where things in the past. The depiction was brutal and realistic, it just makes it so touching and moving. 
Elisa, the mute woman, was loving in her own silent way. Without talking she could, with her gestures and her actions, show us that speaking, talking isn't necessary to a human being, that even though you aren't complete for society, that you are broken for society you are still human. 
I couldn't find one single thing that I didn't like in this movie, it was just good.

"bob-the-movie-man","10","37","69","2 February 2018"," A mystical tale of fish and fingers
","With perfect timing after scooping 13 Oscar nominations, ""The Shape of Water"" arrives for preview screenings in the UK. Is it worth all the hype?<br/><br/>Well, in a word, yes. <br/><br/>Not since Spielberg entranced the world in 1982 with a love story between an isolated and lonely child and an alien, stranded a million light-years from home, have we seen a magical fairy-tale so well told. <br/><br/>Here Lewisham's own Sally Hawkins (""Paddington"", ""Godzilla"") plays Elisa Esposito, an attractive but mousy mute living above a cinema and next door to her best friend: a struggling artist called Giles (Richard Jenkins). Sexually-frustrated, Elisa works out those tensions in the bath every morning before heading off to work as a cleaner at a government research institute. Together with partner Zelda Fuller (Octavia Spencer, ""Hidden Figures"") she is asked to clean a highly secured room where a mysterious aquatic creature is being studied by the cruel and militaristic Strickland (Michael Shannon, ""Midnight Special"", ""Nocturnal Animals"") and the more compassionate scientist Hoffstetler. (The latter is played by Michael Stuhlbarg (""Miss Sloane"", ""Steve Jobs"") in a performance that wasn't recognised by the Academy, but for me really held the film's story together). Elisa forms a relationship with the creature, and as the scientific investigations turn darker, she becomes determined to help him. <br/><br/>When you think about it, the similarities in the screenplay with E.T. are quite striking. But this is most definitely not a kid's film, containing full frontal nudity, sex and some considerable violence, some of it ""hands-over-the-eyes"" worthy. Most of this violence comes courtesy of Shannon's character, who is truly monstrous. He is uncontrollably vicious, single-minded and amoral: a hand over the mouth to silence his wife during vigourous sex cleverly belies where his true lust currently lies. (Shannon is just so convincing in all of his roles that, after ""Nocturnal Animals"", it is a bit of a surprise to see that he is still alive and well!)<br/><br/>It's worth pointing out for balance at this point that my wife thought this portrayal was over-egged for its villany, and she rated the film less highly than I did because of it.<br/><br/>So its no Oscar nomination this time for Shannon as a supporting actor. But that honour goes to Richard Jenkins, who is spectacularly good as the movie-musical-loving and pie-munching neighbour who is drawn unwillingly into Elisa's plans. Giles is a richly fashioned character - also the film's narrator - who struggles to fit in with the cruel and rascist 1962 world that he finds himself in. ""Sometimes I think I was born too early or too late for my life"" he bemoans to the creature whose loneliness he relates to. A scene in a cafe where he fastidiously wipes all traces of pie-filling from his tongue is masterfully done. <br/><br/>Octavia Spencer is also Oscar nominated for Best Supporting Actress, and it's a magical partnership she shares with Hawkins, with each bouncing off each other wonderfully.<br/><br/>This leads to a 'no brainer' Oscar nomination for Sally Hawkins who delivers a star turn. She has to go through such a huge range of emotions in this film, and she genuinely makes you really care about the outcome like few films this year. It's a little tricky since I haven't seen ""I Tonya"" or ""Ladybird"" yet, but I would have thought that Ms Hawkins is going to possibly give Frances McDormand the closest run for her money on March 4th. My money would still be on McDormand for ""3 Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"", but the Oscar voters are bound to love ""The Shape of Water"". For like ""La La Land"" last year, the film is (rather surprisingly for me) another love letter to Hollywood's golden years, with Elisa and Giles living out their lives with classic movie music and dance numbers: a medium that Elisa only ever truly finds here ""voice"" through.<br/><br/>In the technical categories the Oscar nominations were for Cinematography (Dan Laustsen); Film Editing (Sidney Wolinsky); Sound Editing (Nathan Robitaille and Nelson Ferreira); Sound Mixing (Glen Gauthier, Christian Cooke and Brad Zoern); Production Design (Paul D. Austerberry, Jeffrey A. Melvin and Shane Vieau); Original Score (Alexandre Desplat) and Costume Design (Luis Sequeira). And you really wouldn't want to bet against any of these not to win, for the film is a technical delight. Right from the dreamlike opening titles (arguably, they missed a deserved nomination here for Visual Effects), the film is gorgeous to look at, with such brilliant detail in the production design that there is interesting stuff to look at in every frame. And the film editing is extraordinary: Elisa wobbles on the bucket she's standing on, but it's Strickland's butt, perched on a table, that slips off. This is a film that deserves multiple repeat viewings.<br/><br/>An the helm is the multi-talented Guillermo del Toro (""Pacific Rim"", ""Crimson Peak"") who both directed and co-wrote the exceptionally smart screenplay (with Vanessa Taylor, ""Divergent"") and is nominated for both. I actually found the story to be rather predictable, as regards Elisa's story arc, but that in no way reduced my enjoyment of the film. For the ""original screenplay"" is nothing if not ""original"".... it's witty, intelligent and shocking at different turns. <br/><br/>The violence and sex won't be for everyone... but this is a deep and rich movie experience that everyone who loves the movies should at least appreciate... hopefully in a dry cinema!"

I hope it isn't too bizarre for people to go see, because the story is fantastic. The visuals are visceral and emotive and precisely Guillermo Del Toro. The soundtrack is superb. <br/><br/>There hasn't been a movie that captivated me and had me deeply invested in the characters right off the bat like this one did. There's no moment where you stop and go ""wait, this is a little too weird for me"", it just works. Michael Shannon is fantastic in his role, but might be overshadowed by the flawless Sally Hawkins. Without the addition of Spencer, it might have been too overwhelmingly tragic at times-- she was a nice comedic break in a really pretty heavy story. <br/><br/>I might come back and re-review this later, but for right now all I have left to say is: wow."

"Turfseer","3","181","387","1 January 2018"," Liberal do-gooders save amphibian humanoid from stereotyped right-wing martinets in this vastly overrated tale set in Cold War era
","The Shape of Water is noted director Guillermo del Toro's vastly overrated attempt to link mythic fantasy to the Cold War era. The problem with the film is its absurd premise: there's a secret government facility in Baltimore which houses an amphibian humanoid captured earlier in the Amazon by bad guy Colonel Richard Strickland (a cartoon, right wing martinet adventurer) played by an over the top Michael Shannon.<br/><br/>Even if one accepts the premise (which I of course do not), you would think that security would be tight at the facility to ensure no unauthorized persons have access to the creature. Quite conveniently, however, the film's protagonist, the mute cleaning lady, Elisa (who communicates via sign language), is permitted to perform her cleaning duties inside the room where the newly minted ""creature from the black lagoon"" is imprisoned and easily ends up bonding with him (or it-which ever appellation you prefer!). <br/><br/>Elisa soon hatches a plan to save the creature from the dastardly clutches of Strickland, and Strickland's sponsor, another vile right wing martinet, General Frank Hoyt. Of course the more than noble Elisa is joined by friends and confederates, all again quite conveniently joined at the hip by distinct, commonly held LIBERAL convictions. <br/><br/>These associates include Elisa's best friend Zelda, played by Octavia Spencer in the familiar role as African-American ""help"" (will she ever be cast as the ""bad guy"" in any future films?), Giles, Elisa's neighbor, an artist and closeted gay, and a sympathetic scientist Dr. Robert Hoffstetler, who is actually a Soviet spy (note that Hoffstetler's superiors, are very much Strickland's counterparts, as they also evince a most unpleasant demeanor).<br/><br/>Elisa somehow ends up ferreting the creature out of the facility after she learns of Strickland's deadline to vivisect it, allegedly for scientific purposes. Back at her apartment, she keeps the creature alive in a tub filled with salt water. Once the river is at full tide, the plan is to remove the creature from the apartment and bring it to safety, in the watery refuge.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the creature's dark side becomes slightly manifest when it attempts to take a bite out of a house cat (animal lovers do not despair: the creature is unsuccessful in significantly injuring the little kitty!). Giles is more than happy after it becomes apparent the creature has healing powers, touching Giles on his bald pate, and inducing some hair growth. And Elisa experiences pure bliss after discovering that the creature's genitalia is actually hidden and with a little coaxing, can actually engage in sexual intercourse (the act actually takes place in Elisa's bathroom, now completely flooded to the ceiling).<br/><br/>Strickland, about to be fired by General Hoyt following the creature's disappearance, remains frustrated by not being able to find the lost amphibian (you would have thought that maybe he could have figured it out earlier that Elisa was the number one suspect). <br/><br/>Strickland finally finds out from Zelda's terrified husband after unmercifully browbeating him, that Elisa is indeed the culprit who has sprung the creature from Strickland's deadly lair.<br/><br/>No need to describe the rest of the plot in detail. Suffice it to say, there is a confrontation with Strickland who shoots both our heroes, only to meet his own demise at the hands of the creature, who miraculously recovers from Strickland's bullet to the gut. <br/><br/>Elisa also revives (despite her wounds) and joins the creature in a blissful embrace underwater. How is this accomplished? Well, it seems Del Toro has kept his clues about Elisa's true nature from us all along. She's also some kind of long lost creature, and the wounds on the side of her neck, are actually gills-so she experiences some kind of re-awakening, again most conveniently while embracing her new found ""king.""<br/><br/>I actually have a friend who sees the denouement as some kind of Gnostic allegory. Of course anyone can read into this narrative, anything they want. But the fantasy element certainly seems way out of place with this Cold War tale which also has problems of its own, with its rather cheap triumph of liberal do-goodism over stereotypical right-wing demagoguery."
"ironhorse_iv","8","35","65","8 February 2018"," The Shape of Water is worth fishing out for! It's one hell of a catch!
","Originally pitch as a remake of 1954's 'Creature from the Black Lagoon', in which the gill man whom be portray more sympathetic. Director Guillermo Del Toro hope for the project to be, greenlighted, in order to first capitalize on Universal cinematic 'Dark Universe' concept, as well, as tell & reflect on how he feels to be living in America as an isolate outcast immigrant; in a fish out of water, world, where he doesn't fit, their ideologies. However, the studio wouldn't let it happen, as 2017's 'The Mummy' would be chosen, in its place to lead the pack. Nevertheless, Del Toro was determined, and embark on making a similar movie, mostly on his own, with Fox Searchlight Pictures & TSG Entertainment help, call 'the Shape of Water'. Taking ideas, from many sources, ranging from novels like 1982's novel 'Mrs. Caliban' by author, Rachel Ingall, 1837's ""The Little Mermaid' by Hans Christian Anderson & 1928's 'Amphibian Man' by author, Alexander Belyaev, to video games such as 2007's 'BioShock', to foreign movies like 2001's 'Amelie' to even themes from his previous films like 2004's 'Hell Boy' & 2006's 'Pan's Labyrinth'. Del Toro shape together a number of well-worn genres & turn them into a fantasy romance 'Beauty and the Beast' type story, in which, a mute woman, Elisa Esposito (Sally Hawkins) risk everything, in order to free, a captured amphibian creature (Doug Jones) from being killed in government high-security laboratory, for the sake of love. Without spoiling the movie, too much written by him, while the movie follow familiar formulas, and isn't as original as it could had been, the story still stands out, as something that is very entertaining & compelling to watch. To enhance, the film even more, Del Toro made the right decision in having the movie set in 1962, during the height of the Cold War. Seeing characters having to deal with casual and institutionalized racism, sexism, and homophobia throughout the story; really does raise the stakes; as well, give the audience, a sense of nostalgia awe to not only classic B-list horror movies, but yesteryear films in general & how they still very much, relate, to today's world. Much of this come from the dazzling use of music from composer, Alexandre Desplat, wonderful visuals/special effects, florid cinematography from Dan Laustsen, and art designs that range from the Gothic to steampunk style, locations and costumes, the sumptuous-looking film fully transports the viewer to another time and place, even if it's looks & sounds exceedingly silly at times. Nowhere is this more evident than in the film's most heartwarming sequence, a lavishly designed, 1936's 'Follow the Fleet'-style ballroom black & white dance number. Nevertheless, the movie did have some bigger jarring moments than that. One such thing, was the idea, that everybody that works at the lab, would had the security clearance to see the creature, even if they happen to be the help. It was really hard for me to suspense my disbelief, on that. After all, it seem really odd, that there was no 24/7 security surveillance cameras & armed guards watching at post near the room, for something, that is dealt, as a highly sought after, yet dangerous asset by the government agents. It seem too unrealistic. Another problem with the film is the pacing of the action. It really doesn't make any sense for any government agencies be willing to dissect a rare endangered animal, so earlier in arrival, nor does it add up, why Elisa to wait for so long, to release the Sea-God, back into the wild. After all, the Chesapeake Bay is really close by, regardless how deep, the canal, is. The sequences after the heist, felt, like nothing, but filler. Regardless of that, the underwater sequences are particularly elegant, and really shows, how the hardest of barriers can be broken into. Another cool thing, worth seeing is the use of the color: green. The color really does symbolizes the healing, each character has to take, in order to become better people. Nevertheless, some of the others visual sequences were a little kelted, such as the notorious sex scenes. I think, Del Toro could have told this unconventional love story without including the graphic nudity; and most of all, deprived of the clear implication of an interspecies sexual relationship, a lot better with the use of sexual connotation of eggs. Nevertheless, I do understand, those fans who love these sequences, as it does shows love-making of any kind even taboo in a positive, tasteful light. However, I never got the idea, that the amphibian man love Elisa, the same way, she sexually love him. It really felt like Elisa was taking advances on the defenseless creature with a child-like mind, due to her lack of sexual activities. It's almost as predatory & gross, as Colonel Strickland (Michael Shannon)'s advances toward her. It was a little off-putting. Look, as much as fans can spin it. It still bestiality, no matter, how they put it. If this film was about adult man screwing a defenseless sea turtle. Then, they would be, singing a different tune. Regardless of that, I like the fact that the lover's perspective never changed; even when face from biblical style threats, saying that what they're doing is sinful. I just wish, the relationship between sea being & Elisa was a little more developed. Nevertheless, Hawkins's portrayal of a mute, lonely, passionate janitor was very convincing. She is the heart of this movie and it simply wouldn't work as well, without her. As for Jones. His pantomime performance breathe life and humanity into this film's amphibian man; making it his most soulful, captivating creation yet. As for Shannon and Octavia Spencer, they gave solid support, along with Richard Jenkins as Giles, but neither performer is exactly covering new ground in their respective roles. In the end, 'Shape of Water' is still an incredible film, even with its many flaws. It's worth dipping into. So check it out!"

","This film is beautiful in every kind of way. I have absolutely nothing bad to say regarding the cinematography, writing, acting or anything else. In my opinion, this film is incredible - and has plot which is completely unpredictable (which is rare these days)."
"CinemaClown","Null","51","99","16 March 2018"," An Above Average Creature Feature With Stellar Production Design
","A wonderful amalgamation of sumptuous production design, lush camerawork, composed direction & excellent lead performance, The Shape of Water continues Guillermo del Toro's fascination with monsters and is an unconventional story of love that's pure, perceptive & poetic.<br/><br/>Set in 1960s America during the Cold War, The Shape of Water tells the story of a mute woman who works at a top secret facility as a janitor where she encounters a captured humanoid amphibian creature, with whom she forms a unique bond & later helps him escape from his captivity.<br/><br/>Co-written & directed by Guillermo del Toro (best known for The Devil's Backbone, Pan's Labyrinth & Crimson Peak), of all the films that I've seen from the notable filmmaker, The Shape of Water is the weakest. Nothing about it is terrible actually but there is nothing about it that's memorable either. <br/><br/>It's a typical love story between atypical characters that's crafted with affection, told with tenderness & decorated with splendid set pieces. There is a warmth to their blossoming romance at first but it becomes monotonous during the second half. That dance scene in particular is absolutely cringeworthy.<br/><br/>There isn't much to complain in the technical department though. The set pieces in Guillermo del Toro films are usually so finely detailed & refined that much of it is often mistaken for computer generated imagery. Brilliantly utilising the shades of green, Cinematography give its images a luminous quality & fairy tale vibe.<br/><br/>Editing calmly directs its different subplots towards the same outcome but pacing is a bit on the slow side, plus there are moments that could have used a few trims. Alexandre Desplat's score resonates a tenderness of its own with its serene tracks though the songs (both original & incorporated) fail to uplift the whole narrative.<br/><br/>Coming to the performances, The Shape of Water packs a reliable cast amongst whom Sally Hawkins impress the most in what's a silent rendition that's packed with sincere emotions. Doug Jones adds yet another non-human character to his collection while Octavia Spencer, Richard Jenkins, Michael Stuhlbarg & Michael Shannon provide good support in their given roles.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, The Shape of Water is beautiful to look at and makes splendid use of the director's trademarks but it definitely isn't one of del Toro's finest films. The subplots are more interesting than the main story at hand here, but Hawkins does well to keep us invested in her character's journey to an extent. In short, The Shape of Water is an above average creature feature wrapped in a pretty package."

The concept of ""willing suspension of disbelief"" is thrown out the window and replaced with a plot and characters that was just plain silly and unbelievable.
The only part of the movie I enjoyed was when for a moment it appeared that most of the major characters were dead at the end. Artistically, they died at the opening credits.
Once upon a time movies were made by studios that wanted to make a product that their customers wanted to see - an entertaining movie/story. Now, apparently movies are made by so called artist, who want to push their ""art"" onto the rest of us, regardless of whether it's entertaining or not.

"martin_white17","10","47","91","27 February 2018"," Guillermo Del Toro's fantasy tale of an unconventional romance absolutely soars.
","Its gone on record that director Guillermo Del Toro himself has said that The Shape of Water is the only film he is entirely 100% happy with. After viewing it twice now, I must admit that I also basked in his happiness by not wasting any time in making up my mind that this is the man's most majestic masterpiece to date. Eclipsing the then unconditional love I had for both The Devil's Backbone and Pan's Labyrinth, this is a film that is utterly stunning, gorgeous and damn beautiful in its visuals, aesthetics and its now, BAFTA winning production design.<br/><br/>As much as it is another dark fantasy; examining the themes of love, loss, communication and language, Del Toro's magnum opus can also be regarded as a real compassionate love letter to the golden age cinema era of musicals and romantic comedies featuring the likes of Fred Astaire, Gene Kelly and Frank Sinatra, in a time period at the movies where absolutely everything had a happy ending. This is just one aspect of the movie that really helps steer you into completely believing in this unconventional central love story at its heart. Honestly, it's been a good long while since I've seen something on this scale that radiates of such sheer and captivating human beauty. This is further aided by Sally Hawkins' amazing Oscar and BAFTA nominated performance that instead of words, is able to convey so much through body language and human emotive feelings as a way of communicating with others and making sense of the world she lives in. She makes efficacious effort as an actress in the role of Elisa in potently using many of her different facial expressions whenever she is curious, happy, excited or angry as a simple yet very effective translation to audiences.<br/><br/>In terms of bringing this bizarre love story magically to life, renowned composer Alexandre Desplat, who I've been a long-time fan of, conducts a really hypnotising and wonderful score here that really sets and nails the romantic fantasy tone of the film. At times, hearing the score made me feel like this film transported me to the romantic city of Paris instead of being set in America. A truly mesmerising score that lends itself as an extra added character. Other accomplished cast members such as Octavia Spencer, Richard Jenkins and Michael Stuhlbarg all give excellent supportive performances to Hawkins' leading role but it's Michael Shannon as the main villain and real monster of the piece, who is truly on the same amazing par as Hawkins in terms of the highly impressive acting.<br/><br/>I've seen Shannon play a few villainous roles in the past but never have I seen him play one as ruthless, detestable and sadistic as he does here in the role of Richard Strickland; a government official responsible for bringing in the creature into the lab in the first place, as he takes an immediate dislike to this Amphibian like God, torturing and bullying it with every chance he can get. As a character, Strickland is someone who is very controlled and loves being able to live by his own rules and regulations. It's only when things don't go his way and he can't get the answers he wants, that all Hell breaks loose and things start getting ugly. Shannon was the perfect actor to play this evil antagonist role and I can't think of anyone else right now who would have pulled it off just as well as he did.<br/><br/>The best moments in the film are the scenes where Elisa and the creature are alone together. You really believe that they were destined to be together forever, the more they begin to understand one another. As their relationship grows the more times they're able to meet in secret, we begin to realise that the creature is a lot more intelligent than when we first see him appear. He too also responds well to sign language and communication, and particularly music. It soon becomes clear that both these characters are prisoners in a society that are too afraid to understand their motives and as a spectator, I wanted nothing more than to see these two break away free and live happily ever after.<br/><br/>Not sure if my words did complete justice to what a stunning masterpiece The Shape of Water really is but I'm hoping it's convinced at least a few of you to see it on the big screen. There is literally nothing about this film that I didn't like. An entirely flawless and incredible piece of cinema. I'm thrilled that Guillermo Del Toro won the BAFTA award for Best Director as he totally, totally deserved it. I seriously urge you to see this wonderful and uplifting abstract movie if you still haven't yet. I'm already tempted to see it all over again."

","These monster movies or whatever you call them should be fun and enjoyable to watch. This movie was slow, boring, depressing at times, subtly racists and what was the point? Basically it's set in 50's with a strong emphasis on the white male patriarchal society. Everyone but the white mail is a second class citizen. There's a water creature involved but it's like he almost takes a back seat to everything else going on in the movie. I don't even care about the nudity but it makes you wonder what is the point, Octavia Spencer plays her usual Hollywood role of fat black sassy woman and an honestly a better movie would of been about her falling in love with the sea creature. It's just a really strange weird moving mixing in elements of stereotypes and racism and sexism (since the women in this movie are secretary's or stay at home wives or ""the help"", the black men are docile and sub servant, and the white men are seen as all powerful except Dimitri who is Russian, and there's a gay painter who has cats and likes show tunes. I mean stick to one script what is this movie trying to be? I was so distracted by all the other stuff in the movie you can't even enjoy the ""love story"" I guess it was trying to be.

First, you have to accept the concept that there's a large amphibian creature that has been captured by the army, and is chained inside a high-security military facility.<br/><br/>Then, you have to accept the fact that Sally Hawkins isn't beautiful. Sally Hawkins is beautiful, but she's a good enough actor to carry off her role as a shy, mousey, mute woman. <br/><br/>Elisa has a job as one of the janitorial staff at the facility. Naturally, she comes into contact with the creature, and communicates with him in sign language. All this is laid out in the first few minutes. After that, the plot proceeds.<br/><br/>Hawkins is great, and so is Octavia Spencer. However, I give the acting honors to Michael Shannon. He embodies pure evil. He always carries a cattle prod with him, which he uses with pleasure whenever he can.<br/><br/>Suspending belief, as I noted above, is required to enjoy the film. However, you have to suspend belief again, because, even by the internal rules of the film, some things didn't make sense. (That's why I didn't give the movie a rating of 10.) <br/><br/>One very positive factor is that the Amphibian Man is an actor in an extremely effective costume. There's a human being inside that costume, and he can act!<br/><br/>The Shape of Water has an extremely high IMDb rating of 8.2. Not everyone liked it however, including Margaret Anne. She would rate it 6. I gave it a 9.<br/><br/>We saw the film at Rochester's wonderful Little Theatre. It will work almost as well on the small screen.<br/><br/>P.S. Stay for the credits.

"jon.h.ochiai","10","48","94","25 December 2017"," The Shape of Love
","""The Shape of Water"" is beautiful. Writer and Director Guillermo del Toro tells the story of the shape of love, that it can look any way you can imagine. His screenplay along with co-writer Vanessa Taylor tells the poignant tale of feeling alone in the world, and the possibility of love that we all deserve. Sally Hawkins is amazing as lonely mute Elisa discovers her greatness within, her voice. Hawkins is so moving in her visage and silence. ""The Shape of Water"" is the strange love story of Elisa and the noble amphibious-man Creature. <br/><br/>Discovering that the Creature's life is threatened, Elisa implores her dear friend Giles, played by compassionate Richard Jenkins, to help save him. Through sign language Elisa says, ""When he looks at me, he does not know how I am incomplete. He sees me as I am."" That breaks your heart. Elisa just wants to be loved. She just wishes to be gotten. We all do. ""The Shape of Water"" eloquently expresses humanity. Awesome Doug Jones literally inhabits the Creature through CGI effects and all. His languid movement and gentle expressions illuminate the noble Creature's generous heart of the one, who loves Elisa back. <br/><br/>Dan Lausten's cinematography mesmerizes. Elisa is the janitor along with her friend Zelda, played by strong Octavia Spencer, on the midnight shift at the secret Government facility in Washington D.C. set in the 1960's during the height of the Cold War. The story set mostly at night has brilliant tones of gray and muted lighting in the midst of this touching love story fable. Del Toro gracefully balances the dichotomy of the narratives. Lausten and del Toro create the astounding images of Jones's shimmering regal blue Creature, nearly human enough for us to cheer on. <br/><br/>Amazingly del Toro's world of ""The Shape of Water"" is mostly light or dark, little gray. The light is Elisa and Giles. Narrator Giles opens the tale of ""the princess without voice"". Jenkins's Giles is the old unemployed commercial artist, who suffers over his sexual identity. <br/><br/>Brilliant Michael Shannon as Government Agent Strickland is the dark. Strickland captured the legendary Creature from the Amazon bringing him back to DC to uncover his secrets. He mercilessly tortures the Creature. In the meantime the Russians are also interested in the mysterious ""asset"" and pursue him as well. Strickland represents the one downside of del Toro's narrative. As embodied by Shannon, Strickland is clever, cruel, vicious and insufferably pious. He is also bigoted. He has no nuance. Greater villains are much grayer. Though gray comes in the form of wise Michael Stuhlberg as Dr. Hoffstetler, the dedicated scientist who seems stand for the Creature. <br/><br/>We first see Hawkins's Elisa awake to begin her janitor night shift. She sets the timer to boil her eggs while she routinely pleasures herself in the bath. Elisa bares telltale scars on her neck. She packs two bagged lunches, one for her apartment neighbor friend Giles (Jenkins). She smiles and takes her bus to work. <br/><br/>Hawkins is understated power in how she expresses Elisa's profound loneliness and hopefulness without saying. Much of the beauty of ""The Shape of Water"" is in the unsaid. Being with the Creature though unlikely as it seems, we get that it is Elisa's ""perchance to dream"". Hawkins harnesses Elisa's authentic desperation, and her great heart touches us with the lighter side of our humanity. <br/><br/>""The Shape of Water"" is the fantastical love story fable. The great fables allow us to enter that world of wonder. ""The Shape of Water"" is the possibility of love no matter what it looks like. That is the world worth visiting, and perhaps living in as well."

","""Incomplete"" sounds like the operative word in Guillermo del Toro's inter-specie romance/fairy-story THE SHAPE OF WATER, headlining this year's Oscar game with a whopping 13 nominations. A mute janitor Elisa Esposito (Hawkins) working at a secret USA government laboratory in Baltimore develops a cordially mutual bond with an amphibian humanoid (Doug Jones, once again, nimbly embodies del Toro's monster under its spectacular camouflage), the sense of ""completion"" is hinted by Elisa's gill-shaped scar on her neck, indicating that there must be an uncanny connection between them, and she must carry out a derring-do to rescue the creature from an imminent vivisection consented by the evil Colonel Richard Strickland (Shannon), yet, even if her plan works, is there a happy-ever-after waiting for the star-crossed lovers in the outside world? <br/><br/>Opening the film with a stunning underwater showpiece of Elisa's water-submersed apartment through the voice of Gilles (Jenkins), Elisa's next-door-neighbor, a gay advertisement illustrator who becomes a father figure to her, del Toro cogently calibrates the story's fantastic texture right at the point of departure, and we are completely ensorcelled by his exhaustively fabricated 1960s' retro setting, tints of glaucous green, sapphire blue and subdued amber, adorned by Alexandre Desplat's euphonious tuneage and eclectic ditties. <br/><br/>If the story doesn't pan out as revelatory as one might anticipate, what del Toro and his co-writer Vanessa Taylor excel in is the conscientiously integrated signs of the times, Elisa, her co-worker Zelda (Spencer), Gilles and Dr. Robert Hoffstetler (Stunhbarg), a Soviet Union mole who steps up as an unlikely aide to Elisa when the crunch comes, they are characters living on the fringe of the society, their skin-color, sexual orientation, gender, vocation or parentage subjects them as the victim of racism, sexism, homophobia, cold war paranoia (destroy the asset so that the enemy can not acquire it as well) and treachery. Applying an unequivocal angel-and-demon dichotomy, the film establishes Col. Strickland as the superlative villain, living his American dream of suburban complacency and hooked by capitalistic consumerism, he will stop at nothing in finishing his job, and Michael Shannon's go-for-broke incarnation of intimidation is non-pareil, it is rather telling that his performance is left mostly unheralded in the awards season, which prompts Richard Jenkins as the MVP amongst the sterling triad of supporting male performers to receive Oscar's recognition, a similar feat when Shannon himself usurped his co-star Aaron Taylor-Johnson to swoop an Oscar nomination in Tom Ford's NOCTURNAL ANIMALS (2016), clearly, the current trend among the Academy members is good guys over sleazebags, which shouldn't be construed as a deprecated remark on Jenkins' affable, nuanced and constantly heart-felt performance. Ineluctably, de Toro pulls no punches in the token victim succumb to the sinister milieu, although violence has been well tempered along the road, Michael Stuhlbarg steals our hearts in his wondrous transmitting of trepidation and pathos. <br/><br/>In the distaff front, Octavia Spencer pulls off an almost unrivaled record as an Oscar-winner bagging a third Oscar nomination in the supporting category (a recent predecessor could be Jason Robards), her Zelda might be just as well snatched from THE HELP (2011), but her earthy effulgence and earnestness are what connect and engage audience. The biggest asset, is of course, Sally Hawkins, deprived of verbal capacity (except for a singing-and-dancing, beauty-and-beast-esque, monochromatic figment of Elisa's imagination), whose expressiveness lurks unassumingly in every shot whether she is gesticulating along either Zelda or Gilles, reveling in her own fantasy or intimacy, or simply brazening out the mounting adversity with grace and valor.<br/><br/>A fluidly bewitching, incredibly poetic tall-tale del Toro's THE SHAPE OF WATER might seem to be hemmed in its conventional narrative structure with every and each turn running to pedestrian, but in its heart of hearts, it sings a hymn to all the ""incomplete"" individuals, never despair, never give up hope."

","The Shape of Water is a film co-written and directed by Guillermo del Tero. I heard of this film for quite some time and was pretty sure that it was going to be good by looking at the trailers. Finally after seeing the film I can say that I was impressed.<br/><br/>Plot: Elisa, a mute janitor, at a research facility forms a bond with an alien like asset bought on for research at the facility.<br/><br/>Story and direction: Having not seen much of del Tero's work, I didn't know what to expect. But I knew that it will be something to look out for. The story has not much to it. But the way it was said was very impressive. Much credit goes to del Tero for giving us a great visual experience. The characters also are to look out for. Each are different and contrasting from each other. But you feel for each of the characters, which anyone wants out of any film. The production quality and make up for the characters (especially the asset) is top notch. I don't know how much of VFX was used for the film, but if used it was excellent. The costumes and cinematography made it look like the ear of Cold War. Hats off to del Tero for putting up a fabulous crew with a shoestring budget. But the film still has issues. Apart from the film being quite known, some scenes felt a bit cliched. I could guess as to what would happen next. Also the score from Alexandre Desplat was not that interesting. Yes, the old songs used were good to hear but apart from that nothing in the score was a stand-out.<br/><br/>Performances: This film is filled with great performances. Starting with Sally Hawkins. I was mesmerized with her performance. She nailed her character so perfectly. Richard Jenkins was also to look out for. Octavia Spencer also did a fabulous job. Many didn't mention but I did like the performances of Michael Shannon and Michael Stuhlbarg. And finally, Doug Jones was quite good as the Alien.<br/><br/>Favorite Scene: It would be the one where Eliza shows the Asset how to eat the egg. This scene felt very crucial to the bond formed between these two characters. The honesty and earnest-ness is what captivated me towards the scene.<br/><br/>Verdict: This film was great and a visual masterpiece. The film is a great example that a big budget is not needed for anyone to make a great film.<br/><br/>I am going with an 8.5/10."

","Shape of Water is probably the most ""out of order"" Film I have seen in a long time- not in a negative way.<br/><br/>The movie is set in an unbelievably beautiful setting that aims at recreating the 1960s, and it worked- watching ""Shape of Water"" feels like traveling into another time and world, since it has fantasy elements.
The music was conducted by Alexandre Desplat, a great composer, and he did it again: he created a awesomely fitting score, that has its themes and little nuances, and fits the movie very well.
The story itself could be considered as a classic love story but I don't want to go into any detail.
Sally Hawkings, being the protagonist of ""Shape of Water"", did a perfect job that definitely is worth an Academy Award. The rest of the cast, e.g. Octavia Spencer, Richard Jenkins or Michael Shannon, complement the set of amazing and on-spot acting performances.<br/><br/>This is an amazing movie which can enchant you but also leave you behind unimpressed/untouched.
Be aware, this is a special kind of movie- and most of all, a special love story. 
It sometimes has harsh dialogues and comes along with a little violence and brutality , so you better be prepared for this.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, this film, by Gulliermo del Toro, is a great movie which I enjoyed a lot, but personally I can not call it ""perfect""- but that's up to everyone.
It will most certainty win some Oscars- and I'd say: well-deserved."

"kluseba","8","34","64","31 January 2018"," A fairy tale for adults
","Here comes the only minor spoiler of my review: Octavia Spencer doesn't talk about chicken in this movie. This is great. Now, let's move one.<br/><br/>Guillermo del Toro's The Shape of Water is a modern fairy tale that takes place during the sixties. It tells the story of a mute janitor called Elisa who has good friends in gay artist and neighbor Giles and her black work colleague Zelda but she still feels lonesome because she doesn't have a man in her life. She works at a secret government laboratory and witnesses how a mysterious humanoid amphibian arrives there for scientific purposes. Inexplicably intrigued by the tormented and tortured creature, Elisa forms a close bond with the creature who turns out to be intelligent. However, Colonel Strickland, who has captured the mysterious creature in South America, starts to despise it after it fought its tormentor, biting off two of his fingers. When the government laboratory comes to the conclusion that the creature is useless, they plan to kill it. Before Colonel Strickland can triumphantly execute the order, Elisa decides to save the creature with the help of Giles and Zelda, risking their lives. Soon, three different parties, Elisa and her friends, a group of Soviet secret agents and American military personnel face one another because they all have different plans for the humanoid amphibian.<br/><br/>The Shape of Water has several intriguing elements. The storytelling is well-paced, finding the right balance between incorporating fantastic elements and bringing back to life the Cold War in the sixties, showing the flaws and strengths of American society back then. The movie deals with homophobia and segregation, without being too moralizing. The settings are carefully chosen, contrasting shiny restaurants, poor apartments and cold bunkers. The visual special effects are stunning, especially all scenes involving water and the humanoid amphibian. The dream-like opening sequence grabs your attention right from the start and is a highlight. The characters are intriguing enough to care about them, as both the diversified cast of protagonists convinces as well as the reckless antagonists. The acting performances go hand in hand with the intriguing characters and Sally Hawkins is particularly convincing as unusual lead actress with a mysterious past. The movie makes many clever references to other films and forms of art because the main character and her neighbor are interested in film and music and living right above an old movie theater. This gives the film an intellectual touch and invites viewers to discover the culture of the fifties and sixties.<br/><br/>Obviously, the story itself isn't particularly creative, reminding me of a mixture of Beauty and the Beast and Avatar. Many elements of the movie are quite predictable and even foreshadowed in the very first scene of the film. If you plan on watching this fairy tale with your young children, you should rather not because right after the opening sequence, we see the lead actress fully undressed, taking a bath and masturbating. Not that this is any problem since it tells us about both the purity and loneliness of the main character, but it isn't something young children should see. The Shape of Water is a fairy tale for intellectual adults with all its colorful references.<br/><br/>The Shape of Water is a colorful, creative and entertaining fairy tale. It deserves most of the praise it gets, even though a whopping thirteen Academy Awards nominations are quite a stretch. Enjoy this beautiful film at your local movie theater."
"T-Dawg210","9","53","105","11 March 2018"," Great Film that emphasizes the importance of communication and fear of 'others.'
","The Shape of Water-A Wonderful Adult Fairy Tale Movie about Communication<br/><br/>Ever since visiting the lakes, going fishing, and watching the Disney movie Atlantis, I've always had an obsession with the underwater world and believed that other human-like creatures were lurking beneath the oceans. So, before watching Guillermo Del Toro's The Shape of Water (2017), I was initially excited for this film, and after watching it, I was genuinely impressed with the cinematography, visuals, and theme. The Shape of Water (2017) stylishly tells the story of a classic monster-adult fairy tale and fuses with old Hollywood musical, making it a fascinating experience. Furthermore, with exceptional cinematography and visuals, this film has a great message about the importance of communication and shows it through the excellent development of the characters and narrative. <br/><br/>The movie shows us Elisa (Sally Hawkins), who is a mute woman that works as a nighttime janitor in a research facility center. She doesn't have many friends, except her African-American co-worker friend Zelda Fuller (Octavia Spencer) who spends most of the time talking, and her close neighbor, who is a closeted gay man called Giles (Richard Jenkins). One day, as Elisa is working, the facility center brings an amphibious creature that lives underwater. Intrigued by the creature, Elisa secretly tries to get closer to him by bringing eggs, playing musicals, and teaching him to sign language. Eventually, these two get closer, but Elisa's superior Strickland wants to dissect the creature for study purposes and to avoid the Russians to get more information as well. <br/><br/>In Del Toro's movies, many of his films have great visuals, and with The Shape of Water (2017), the director carefully uses colors to evoke the character's state of mind. The turquoise and teal colored background were used through the entire period to evoke the sense of bleakness and loneliness. All the characters, despite generally having a happy life have some sort of emptiness in their lives and Del Toro wanted to show it through the screen vividly. And so, when the use of color red appears, it is used in controlled situations to show passion and delight in Elisa, making it easier to establish the overall mood. <br/><br/>As for the performance, all the characters including the supporting roles had great depth. The most astonishing feature of the film's vision was that the story was delivered from a voiceless woman, a gay artist, and a black woman, all sharing some problems regarding communication. In particular, Sally Hawkins undoubtedly outshines the rest of the characters as she only uses her body to communicate with others, making it both humorous, powerful, and truly magical. Additionally, Spencer and Jenkins elevate the arc of the story while Shannon as Strickland is genuinely a horrific villain. <br/><br/>Because the creature is an outsider, naturally, Elisa, Zelda, and Giles who are also social pariahs see the amphibious creature as something magnificent while Strickland sees him as ""ugly as sin."" These direct contrasts show how the importance of communication is demonstrated through the character's situations. Questions such as what happens when we are taken away the ability to communicate with others or who gets to decide who talks are all emphasized throughout the film. In a way, because the characters are social minorities, their voices are all suppressed. Elisa cannot verbally communicate, so she gets help from her close friends Zelda and Giles, making her feel marginalized and incomplete. On the other hand, Strickland's position in society allows him to abuse his powers and use communication only to take advantage of his subordinates. <br/><br/>Just as the title suggests, the element of water is flexible and adaptable, which illustrates that love can have many different shapes and form. Even though Elisa might not be able to communicate verbally, she still can interact with the creature through sign language and does not have to be judged for who she is. In a way, as she bonds with the being, it is shown that sex can also be a form of communication, one that Elisa eventually does to deepen the relationship with her love. Despite the absence of speech, Elisa uses other methods-especially in the water- to connect and communicate with the creature, making her self-expression fill the void that was empty in her life with someone who will love her just for the way she is.<br/><br/>All in all, Del Toro and his cast and crew delivers a compelling film by showcasing unique and imaginative elements of the characters and story. It is no doubt that The Shape of Water (2017) is one of Del Toro's best works. By sticking with the theme of communication, this movie has a relevant message in modern society, and just like water, one can decide what kind of meaning love wants to be."
"Thekeybaldemasterrises","10","41","79","5 January 2018"," Del Toro's most artful and meaningful film since Pan's Labryinth
","So my award contenders binge begins with the Shape of Water. This was a very beautiful movie. Very "" steamy""and ""violent"" . But I really enjoyed it. I saw the Guillermo del Toro exhibit at LACMA last year and the man has such a unique style that I really admire. He knows how to world build in a way that's both magical and realistic. I mean this production design is just outstanding and beautiful to look at. Its a romantic story with beautiful art direction and awesome performances. The score was actually really nice too it was refreshing to have nice music in the background that flowed really well. I really liked Richard Jenkins and how even though it's in the 60's his story is very relevant to today. Sally Hawkins plays a mute character this entire movie and even though she doesn't say a word her performance sill conveys so much emotion. The movie can be off putting for some people because it might be cheesy or just really creepy and odd but it's crafted so well the pros outweigh the cons for me. I think I have to remove the It movie from my top 10 and bump some things up one so this becomes #6 on my list. I'll post a final list once I see the other nominees if I make more changes. Ps to all my fellow gamers, if Bioshock were to become a movie should Del Toro do it? I mean watch the first 10 minutes and think what it would be like if he did a Bioshock movie. Easy 9.5/10 for me."
"fletcherc21","7","12","19","19 December 2017"," Oddly Beautiful
","The Shape of Water is Guillermo Del Toro's latest blend of fantasy mysticism and gritty realism. Set around 1960, Sally Hawkins stars as a mute janitor at a research facility who falls in love with a creature that they pulled from the Amazon. This is beautifully played over a cold war backdrop with outstanding supporting performances, like Octavia Spencer as the sassy coworker, Michael Shannon as the sadistic boss, and Richard Jenkins as her struggling neighbor. It is firmly reminiscent of Del Toro's Pan's Labyrinth, without feeling too similar.<br/><br/>There were several moments when it dipped into being unnecessarily crude for a few cheap laughs that felt out of place. They also took her relationship with the creature to a place that kind of undermined the beauty of it and weakened the film as a whole. Del Toro definitely played into the R rating by diverting a touching love story to places that didn't help develop it.<br/><br/>The Shape of Water is Del Toro's best work since Pan's Labyrinth and features beautiful cinematography and very strong work by the entire cast. However, it never manages to break through into being a truly great film despite showing the potential."

"himanshutri","7","22","39","4 February 2018"," Love: the Universal Language
","We all crave for love and care. The exchange of those emotions with our world around keeps us going. The humanity finds new outlets when the existing ones don't give way to release and expression. In right circumstances, love finds new faces and, in some other, it subtly devolves into a disease. Guillermo del Toro preens those faces up beautifully in his novel imagination, The Shape of Water.<br/><br/>The movie is set up in the cold world era, with visible contempt for certain skin colour and race à la hierarchical structure and caste divide in India of the same period. Evidently, getting ahead at all cost was starting to get common at that time in the US-even at the cost of values and human relationship. In such an environment what chance does a mute janitor has other than to be grateful for the small mercies of the world? She sure has a company with an old man, Giles, her neighbour, whose services are no more needed by his employer. His paintings don't find a place in a rapidly moving world that values usefulness over subtlety. Guillermo aptly portrays two people living with compatible loneliness. Even more apt for 2010s than 1970s!<br/><br/>Despite of all this darkness, love and care floats like a cuckoo's constant humming in the story. Elisa's care for her cats, movie theatre owner's compassionate behaviour towards his protagonist tenants, Zelda holding the line for Elisa and finally Elisa's care for humanoid amphibious creature are like many threads that weave a beautiful colour across a piece of muslin. The story isn't a first of its kind. There are many movies depicting an animal falling in love with a human (King Kong, Shrek, etc.). Considering many may not prefer to watch such a love story, treading that path and keeping the audience hooked and to make them appreciate the evolution of emotions is not easy, but Guillermo does it with conviction.<br/><br/>Most of the characters round up well as the story progresses. Being a female, an orphan and a janitor with not many around having the time and patience to 'listen' to her gestures, she tends to herself. Her sexuality woven into her daily routine is shown in a bland yet beautiful way and highlight her lonely world. Guillermo must be appreciated for picturising that non-judgementally. Her coming to find an expression in the creature appears natural. Now, juxtapose Giles' refusing to understand Elisa's anxiously exaggerated gestures against the creature using the same gestures to express its love for her. That's the movie's high point.<br/><br/>Zelda with her skin colour and Giles with his sexual orientation similarly crave for a caring company. As an oddity, Colonel Richard Strickland's character does not evolve as the story advances. His motive to win at all cost is not well explained except that a threat to his survival finally made him even darker.<br/><br/>The way the scientist Robert Hoffstetle (a soviet spy in disguise who is constantly threatened by the ruthlessness of both Colonel Richard Strickland and Hoffstetle's soviet handlers) helps to save the amphibian shows how an attempt to understand can bring compassion and love. In contrast, Colonel Strickland's desire to win at all cost harbours ruthless pragmatism at the cost of those emotions.<br/><br/>The movie's climax is a bit routine and thus disappointing. It develops suddenly ending in a bland win of good over evil.<br/><br/>Even if one doesn't relate to a lady falling for an animal, the true appreciation of the subtlety of human emotions and values is what makes the movie watchable. A commendable piece of art.<br/><br/><br/><br/>~ Himanshu Trivedi"
"Vartiainen","Null","84","174","18 February 2018"," Bizarre adult fairy tale love story
","It's the 60s, the era of Cold War. The Americans are living their dream, while at the same time fearing the nuclear bomb and the Red Threat. Spy game is in full bloom and both of the great nations are vying for technological supremacy. In the midst of this, a most curious specimen arrives at a space research laboratory in Baltimore. A being unlike anything seen by modern science. But curiously it's the mute cleaning woman, who best seems to understand this beastman.<br/><br/>Guillermo del Toro has always traveled down his own path. In fact, I'm unsure whether he even knows the main path exists at all. With The Shape of Water he returns back to the genre of adult fairy tales. Quite like his previous film, Pan's Labyrinth. And truth be told, these two films have much in common. Both feature female characters struggling between two worlds, those of myth and reality. In both the myth offers an escape both from the fears and horrors of the real world. In both it's the reality that reveals itself to be the source of true evil.<br/><br/>That being said, there are differences. The setting is quite different, changing war-torn Spain for Cold War United States, though both of these locations are treated with a critical and nostalgic touch, although the films don't forget to have a smile every now and then either. And whereas Pan's Labyrinth was told through the eyes of a child protagonist, reflecting and talking about the fears and challenges of childhood, The Shape of Water has as its main character a woman. A sexually frustrated, lonely woman. And the film reflects that quite nicely. It's a risque film in many respects and I doff my hat to del Toro for having the guts to go all the way.<br/><br/>It's also a beautifully acted film. Sally Hawkins is marvelous, especially having to play a mute person. Yet her soul is laid bare in front of us and we struggle alongside her through her hardships and victories. Michael Shannon as Colonel Strickland gives a great performance as well and I do feel he was slightly snubbed in not getting an Oscar nomination.<br/><br/>If I was forced to choose, I would say Pan's Labyrinth is the better film. But it's a minute difference. The Shape of Water is a beautiful, thoughtful film that shows del Toro to be one of the best storytellers of our time."

I spent 1/2 of this movie incredibly agitated at how scared and weak Zelda is. Scared to do this, scared to do that. It was exhausting. I partially blame actor Sally Hawking - didn't she have a voice and an opportunity to say ""look. I starved myself for this character. I look underweight and malnourished and just am so sheepish and frightened all the time. Any woman who has been thru abuse like Zelda had would theoretically come back strong and eat a sandwich.""

","Guillermo del Toro directs and co-writes with Vanessa Taylor what would turn out to be the Best Picture Academy Award Winner for 2017. A much loved film that's not without dissention in certain quarters, it's a picture that warrants dissention but it should be noted that just because someone doesn't like it, that doesn't make it a bad film. I'm certainly in the camp that finds it over praised, even annoyingly disappointing, whilst appreciating many of the facets within its production.<br/><br/>Story in simple terms is a Beauty and the Beast like fable where Sally Hawkins' mute cleaning lady Elisa Esposito falls in love with a captured Amphibian Man. Amphibian Man is known by the government types as The Asset, and as the Cold War rises and 60s paranoia takes a hold, the American big wigs want to vivisect the special species to learn from it. Elisa, after courting ""The Asset"", enlists the help of close friends and plots to free the creature from its captivity in the underground medical bunker labyrinth place.<br/><br/>Now as simple as that sounds, there is more to it than that, del Toro and Taylor whilst enveloping the pic in a fantasy realm feel, ensure messages are thrust hard at the viewers. Be it the racial disharmony, the quest for different walks of life finding love with each other, the cry for humans to stop being bad and killing things because they don't understand them, torture is evil and etc etc. It's all right there in your face and we get it. So plot maybe simple but for sure there's a lot being said in the narrative.<br/><br/>Yet as great as it looks, and it's superbly acted by Hawkins, Michael Shannon, Richard Jenkins and Octavia Spencer, it just to me loses its way come the mid-point, getting daft and even getting a little icky into the bargain. I have no problem with improbabilities and outrageous contrivances here, this is del Toro painting one of his fantastical worlds - only on Earth in the early 60s! But the pay off is poor, hinging on a twist that's not only ridiculous, but insulting as well because otherwise the pic would be very troubling indeed. No art deco eye orgasms or vibrant characterisations can compensate for a film that runs out of steam.<br/><br/>That said, I was glad to have watched it, there's even a possibility I could return to it in the future - this is very good film making. But it's not a great film by any stretch of the imagination and not for the first time in the Academy's long history, many are baffled by their choice of Best Picture winner. 6/10"

","In this unusual mesh of fantasy, romance and science fiction, a mute woman working as a lab custodian in the late 60s falls for an abused, captive sea monster. The film dons many hats, several at the same time, which distract and compete for attention: that central relationship, the military's plans for the creature, a neighbor's quest to reclaim his job with an ad agency, a coworker's marriage, a supervisor's frustrated home life. Each adds a layer to the onion skin, and color to the world, but ultimately they feel like light diversions from the main course. On a technical level, it's exceptional. Guillermo del Toro's work has never been short on conceptual know-how, and The Shape of Water merely continues his habit of one-upping the preceding film. The beast itself, heavily influenced by The Creature from the Black Lagoon with a hint or two of Abe Sapien from del Toro's Hellboy, looks fantastic. Lifelike and expressive, it's easy to buy into as a thinking, feeling participant in the story. Sally Hawkins is wonderful as the human lead, drawing inspiration from dozens of classic silent films in her flourishing role as a mousey, passionate, eloquent young woman. Set designs, too, are distinct and remarkable, from the slimy, clinical confines of the military science lab to her crusty, crumbling apartment just above an active movie theater. The plot drags, though, and more than once edges awfully close to cliche. I enjoyed it, particularly on a thematic level, but I wish it was about twenty minutes shorter."
"adlion94","8","32","60","25 March 2018"," Weird, modern take on Beauty & Beast
","Since this film has received so much attention, I had to see what all the fuss is about. Typical for a GDT film, it's beautiful, moody, grotesque, bizarre and fantastical. I liked it and it certainly involved me in the story.<br/><br/>We are introduced to a strange little mute woman who masterbates in the morning while she's making hard boiled eggs. She lives in an impossibly ""distressed & antiqued"" apartment in what looks like the 1940s, but we come to find out it's really the 1960s. She listens to records that were already old in the 1960s and, of course, she lives above a movie theater. Her best friend is a closeted old gay man, shunned from a modernizing advertising world that no longer wants his paintings for print advertisements. He wonders later in the film if he was born too early or too late to have lived his lonely life. Deep.<br/><br/>So, this isn't meant to be a realistic film. It's about as realistic as Beauty & the Beast, but it takes place in the dank ""castle"" of a government science facility. The creature shows up with as little explanation. Then again, nobody explains where the old witch in B&tB comes from to curse the prince either. So...<br/><br/>I found all the characters very interesting. They all had believable, human emotions and motivation. Eliza's friend is well depicted as a woman with a humdrum life as a janitor with a lazy, dependent husband. The scientist, a spy for the Soviets, is a man beyond a country. He's disloyal to Americans, and he doesn't even deliver for the Soviets. He's a man who admires what nature has created. The main bad guy (forgot his name) is thankfully quite humanized - with a subservient family and a new Cadillac. When the general dresses him down, you can see the urgency on his face as his life's work slips away. All that matters to him is ""getting the job done"" and following protocol. I think the rotted fingers were a symbol of him being attached to a career that has rotted his humanity and soul. When he tears them off, he's also thrown off his career self-imprisonment.<br/><br/>I found the whimsical elements of the film very intriging. By BDT never lets this become Disney either. Strange interspecies sex goes on, cats are eaten alive and fish men are tortured with cow prods. The apartments looked like late 19th century French apartments, with art, philosophy and literature books strewn about as only an obsessive set designer could have directed. The government facility is always tinted sickly green, in keeping with with the diseased pursuits of weapons and killing machines of the cold war. Classic musicals take center stage, especially when Eliza finds her voice and dances with her fishly prince in a daydream. Of course, a world class movie theater from the 1930s is right below her, in modest, rundown Baltimore.<br/><br/>The ""scars"" on Eliza's neck being gills was a facinating final twist. I think the implication is that Eliza, being from South America (from where fish man hails), is an indication she's a half-breed. Perhaps her beatings were a result of her being different as a child, the offspring of a fish/human encounter. It is left to the imagination.<br/><br/>The film goes on a little long. It couldn've used a 10-15 minute trim. I find GDT films to be self-obsessively set-directed. I dislike when the sets are ""on display"" rather than locations for the characters and plots. No apartments like those ever existed in Baltimore, MD. I could barely believe anything ever looked like that on the left bank in Paris in the 1890s.<br/><br/>I definitely recommend. Be ready for some weird stuff. But be ready to pull for the protagonist and feel a bit sorry for the antagonist. All the supporting characters are richly created. If only all cinema was this artful."

It's a beautifully romanticised view of the 1960s, with a wonderful soundtrack and exquisite set design. Imagine Bioshock with a love story. From sound to visuals, the style is unique and breathtaking, absolutely sucking you into a dreamlike world absolutely fit for a 'fairytale' such as this. Even monotonous parts of Sally's life are shot beautifully and Del Toro proves to us once again what he's capable of directing.<br/><br/>However it's still Del Toro and anyone who's seen one of his films, from Pan's Labyrinth to Crimson Peak, knows that he has a penchant for the weird and wacky. Weird and wacky in this case though has never been so beautiful and emotional. Straddling themes of love, politics and what is is to be human, this is a film that will no doubt be studied and loved for years to come, with it improving with each viewing.<br/><br/>Taking just the story and way it's filmed alone it's a wonderful film already; but it's the cast that make it that much more magical. Michael Shannon often plays the bad guy, but there's a reason for this typecast - he's perfect as it. He doesn't necessarily need to shout; with just a look and a mumble, he crafts an intimidating, unpredictable character that poses as an ominous threat throughout. Octavia Spencer is another one typecast, often playing a sassy lady who's prejudiced against (in this case by Shannon's character, believing himself to be God and everyone else, Spencer's character specifically, to be below him), yet she effortlessly excels in this role and is the perfect friend to Elisa. On the other side is Elisa's other friend, Giles. His friendly, but timid character grounds a film with so much craziness and lends some much needed comic relief; sweet and lovely as the film maybe, it's not a light, easy-going comedy. Zelda and Giles are the perfect friends for Elisa, one being black, the other gay, they understand her struggle as a mute and not being able to fit in with a prejudiced world. This is a struggle personified further in the Amphibian Man, animated wonderfully with terrifyingly realistic gills and colourful scales. Straddling the boundary between animal and man, Doug Jones physical performance really sells the character and the theme it represents. The real star of the cast, however, is Sally Hawkins. With next to no lines at all, her performance is stand out. We fall in love with her without her needing to say a word, similarly to the Amphibian Man. It's this similarity which really brings them together, but it's her performance which stands out the most. With every emotion and thought showing on her face, we feel strongly for this character, sympathising her with every step. Never quite given a chance to shine before, it's wonderful to see what Hawkins can do, able to command such screen presence without a voice and to show her character's struggle vividly.<br/><br/>The Shape of Water is an incredible, beautiful and sweet film that will touch the hearts of moviegoers worldwide. A cautionary tale with a plethora of themes and messages that anyone can identify with, this will be a beloved classic, loved more and more with every re-watch. A magical, fairytale that deserves each of its 13 Oscar nominations. It may not win them all, but it certainly deserves the recognition and praise. A masterpiece and an instant classic."
"robertryszewski","Null","32","60","29 January 2018"," Riveting story, great visuals, and emotionally evocative execution
","At first glance, the pace of the film seems to move far too quickly. Within the first fifteen minutes, we meet the main characters, the main setting of the movie, the tantalizing merman himself, and start to see the plot developing already. It turns out, rather than being rushed, the film soars through these parts so quickly because it still has so much more to say and show.<br/><br/>First off, the film's visual effects, setting, and overall world-building for a sense of Cold War era like technology and culture are very comprehensively developed. From the cars we see, to the casual smoking, to plenty of chauvinism, sexism, racism, fear of the Russians, and pious male self-righteousness, everything fits the time period like a glove. At many points the historical accuracy serves as a stark reminder of the many ways our society was once much more openly bigoted and imposing. <br/><br/>My only issue with the visuals would be the merman himself. Seeing him for the first time on screen is jarring, in how low-budget his appearance seems. The merman himself looks like a costume from a movie made in the 60s, very easily a person in a suit rather than an other-worldy creature. With time, the merman's various movements and actions dispel this disbelief, and the immersion of the film comes in to compensate.<br/><br/>Most importantly, the story and its execution are absolutely riveting. The phenomenal acting done by the cast, the pacing of the film, the shots, and the musical scores combine in such a way to evoke exactly what the film wants you to be feeling, even if you're aware of the fact. You cringe viscerally when you see characters act villanously. You shout with anger and disbelief at other moments. You feel uncomfortable and weird at other parts. You're tense with suspense and fear and trepidation as the drama develops. The film had me literally on the edge of my seat, almost too much to handle. Some of the best moments of the film get drawn on, seemingly deliberately, before giving the audience a sense of satisfying resolution, hinting at both the film's effect on the audience and how easily the plot could have taken another turn.<br/><br/>Overall, I would highly recommend The Shape of Water for its story, its cinematography (and acting), and for the experience."
"scope_creep","9","32","60","19 January 2018"," Absolute masterpiece
","I watched this film, and it felt like a story or prequel to Bioshock, perhaps a story that occurred as part of that universe, or some absolute connection that had the feel of that place. It was a love story, but also a story of betrayal, and loss, but also one of salvation. The setting, the long tunnel, presented many stories, each one potentially in its own room. Our room was a humanoid, captured, and lost, who a found love and freedom. It was all Bioshock."

But thank god i was wrong. ""The Shape of Water"" is a beautiful and uncommon love story of a mute woman and a amphibian creature that have to fight to stay together.

","This is about a deaf mute cleaning lady learning to communicate in secret with gentle giant of a creature being experimented on and tortured by a US government agency. <br/><br/>She pities the way he is treated and that leads to displays of kindness and affection that are returned by the monster.<br/><br/>It is a lavish production with a few twists and turns along the way; it is suitable for all. I think it will become a classic before long.<br/><br/>A wonderful bonus was the way the two leading ladies played off of each other.<br/><br/>Truly a delightful film.<br/><br/>At my screening there was a very memorable Q&A with the director that I would like to share.<br/><br/>There were some rather technical questions about Japanese influences in his film (I will look for when I see it again). <br/><br/>The amount of time and effort to make a real (man in a suit) rather than CGI monster and that he financed it out of pocket for more than a year before he got financing from Fox. <br/><br/>A question about his colour pallet, and a comparison of his film with Beauty in the Beast from a little girl in the audience who spoke in Spanish.<br/><br/>He used this question as a springboard to talk about a few topics that were on his mind. You might know the director is from Mexico and now lives in Toronto. He went on to say that many of the problems in the United States are not the fault of Mexico. <br/><br/>Also, that the reason that there is so much conflict in the United States is because it is intentionally being done by the government. <br/><br/>It is pulling people apart and making them fight each other, because, it doesn't want people uniting together to go after the real problem, the 1%.<br/><br/>He said this to great applause. I hope that he has an opportunity to speak to many people about his view of America.<br/><br/>This film BTW was filmed in Toronto and premiered in the theatre that was used for many of the scenes."

"classicsoncall","9","31","58","6 February 2018"," ""He sees me for what I am, as I am.""
","I had my doubts before seeing this film but they were quickly dispelled. What really won me over was the story's placement in what looked like the era of the 1950's, but with a speech broadcast on radio by President John F. Kennedy, the time frame is narrowed down to a couple of years between 1961 and 1963. Even so, the picture beautifully captures the style and sense of the Fifties/Sixties transition - the art work, the color palette, the atmosphere, and the dynamic tension of the Cold War between America and Russia. As for my initial doubts, well, that goes with what one might consider a love story between an amphibian and a human. I really want to say reptile, but the 'Amphibian Man', as he's listed in the credits, did have an ability to exist on land and in water. <br/><br/>What could have been a very creepy relationship between the 'Gill-Man' (Doug Jones) and Elisa Esposito (Sally Hawkins), is handled rather deftly under the direction of Guillermo del Toro. I'm still trying to wrap my head around the whole idea, but without getting graphic at all, the scenes between them are tastefully done. The make-up and costuming of the Amphibian Man is definitely reminiscent of 1954's ""Creature From the Black Lagoon"", and in a lot of respects, the story is very much the same. Both originate the creature in South America, with the earlier film set in the Amazon River Valley. Surprisingly, the earlier movie has some rather extraordinary underwater footage for the Fifties, while the effects employed here are as good as one would expect considering today's technology. <br/><br/>Given my fascination with the late Fifties/early Sixties time frame, which was my personal pre-teen Golden Age, I did manage to pick up on a historical error in the picture. It occurred when Strickland's (Michael Shannon) son asked his father if he could switch the TV from 'The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis' to 'Bonanza'. The two shows would never have aired opposite each other during that 1961-1963 window. Dobie Gillis was seen on Tuesday or Wednesday evenings, while 'Bonanza' made the transition from Saturday to Sunday evenings during this period. But it was cool to also see a clip from another popular show of the era when 'Mister Ed' flashed across the screen. <br/><br/>Given all that, it would have been really cool if instead of seeing the movie clips featuring Betty Grable and Alice Faye, director del Toro could have considered inserting a cameo clip of actress Julie Adams. I won't leave you guessing here, Adams was the nominal 'love interest' of that Creature From the Black Lagoon. They came nowhere close to the kind of relationship Amphibian Man had with Elisa, though their first encounter resulted in a synchronized swim and a playful tease of Adams' feet before she ever sets eyes on the monster."

"asifahsankhan","8","15","25","24 April 2018"," A socio-political fairy tale epic.
","In many ways The Shape of Water is a classic Guillermo Del Toro film. All the director's hallmarks are present: it's a fable, it's set against a socio-political backdrop, and it's about a monster.<br/><br/>That first point is worth bearing in mind. Del Toro's films are always larger than life, and while that can work against him (Pacific Rim was too silly for many), here the broad tone helps offset the edginess of the material. And things get pretty damn edgy.<br/><br/>That's where Del Toro seems to be trying something new. He's always had a taste for cinematic violence, but his films stayed pretty chaste until 2015's Crimson Peak. That film seems to have whet (wet) his appetite for kink, and here he really runs (swims) with it.<br/><br/>This is a romance between two different species, one of them a fish-man imprisoned in a government laboratory. Del Toro never sugar coats the fact that the creature (beautifully performed by Doug Jones), is bestial, as likely to bite your fingers off as he is to wordlessly woo the cleaning lady.<br/><br/>Sally Hawkins plays the recipient of the mer-dude's affections, a mute woman who takes care of her neighbour, an artist portrayed by Richard Jenkins. They are fantastic, as is the rest of the cast, all reliable heavy hitters.<br/><br/>Michael Shannon plays, as he often does, a bureaucrat whose buttoned-down exterior masks a complete maniac. Of all the story beats his is the broadest. No prizes for guessing who turns out to be the real monster here.<br/><br/>The film starts out with a level of whimsy comparable to Amelie, before delving into darker waters. Racism and homophobia begin to loom, and while the parallels Del Toro is drawing will be too clunky for some, the film's huge heart and good intentions are always on display."

","Great evolved makeup and eyes on Doug Jones, although a glaring and horrible rip off of the ""Creature from the Black Lagoon."" Taking a good actress and making her do a gratuitous nude scene is so obvious it reeks of a Harvey Weinstein move, same with the totally unnecessary nudity of Michael Shannon in his bedroom scene, both scenes and what they represented could have been accomplished with less actor abuse. The vile comments about short people, flatulence etc was a ridiculous and ignorant addition to the dialogue of the other cleaning lady. What really ruined it for me was the dream sequence of the creature doing a ballroom dance, it shattered the atmosphere of the creature's reality as badly as Ray Liota stepping out of character in ""Goodfellas"" in the courtroom scene. Some of the music choices were so out of place it was like jamming a round peg into a square hole, absolutely horrendous choices of music in some spots. They should have showed the creature healing his bullet wounds much more clearly and healing her bullet wounds decisively too rather than just jump into the dirty water with bleeding internal damage, show the healing!

The soundtrack in this movie is phenomenal, and Del Toro's choice in old songs fit the movie so well in unexpected ways. <br/><br/>The only thing that threw me off was the black and white dancing and singing between the amphibian man and Elisa. I still do not know what I feel about it. On one hand, it felt very out of place and different from the tone of the rest of the film, yet at the same time, the short scene added a sense of fantasy and romance into the film that made it so jarring but interesting to watch.<br/><br/>Overall, I loved the movie and would highly recommend it."
"WhimsicalVonia","8","30","56","31 December 2017"," A Beautiful Underwater Love Story
","The Shape of Water (2017) <br/><br/>Guillermo del Toro is back. Whimsical love story between a mute and a god-like creature from South America. A film rich with meaning. Cold War, early 1960s. The choice for neither of the lovers to have to ability to speak was genius. They communicate in adorable sign language, gifts of eggs, a card that says ""Glad to have you as my friend"", and emotional connection. Is this not the purest form of love? Early on, Elisa signs ""You. Me. Together"", and it is devastating when she has to let him go, making him understand that it can no longer be that way, that it is now ""You. Alone. Without me.""<br/><br/>The set, meticulously arranged. Besides the obvious theme of water, there is significant color symbolism. Teal is the color of the future. In general, other greens are as well (pies, car, lab, uniforms in lab, gelatine, the creature). Blue, cyans, greens, contribute to the feel of water and fantasy; almost a mystical world, Elisa's World. Everyone else's worlds (Giles, Zelda, Strickland) are Goldens, Ambers and warm colors (Air, Day). Red for Cinema, Life and Love. <br/><br/>Extraordinary cinematography. Elisa and Giles live above a theater, exhibited gorgeously when she immerses herself with her lover underwater, flooding her apartment and dripping onto customers downstairs. What a beautiful underwater paradise. This is recreated in the final scene, as the two lovers escape in the canal, oh so in love, together forever. <br/><br/>Each of the main characters are outcasts: Elisa the mute, her black spunky best friend Zelda, her older gay neighbor Giles, Doctor Hoffstetler (really a Soviet Spy named Demetri), insane villain Strickland who is so driven to perform he has little attachment to his family. It was quite the achievement in such an artsy piece to be able to make each of the characters relatable and lovable. More obviously Elisa, Giles, and the creature. But I also really felt for the undercover Soviet Spy, who actually double crosses both the Americans and Russians by playing a pivotal role in The Asset's escape and rescue. We see the lonely world he is forced to live in, paranoia and secrecy. One of the only things Elisa signs to him is that he is a good man. And he is. Pretty much the only flaws I saw in this film were in the characters of Strickland and Zelda. Both play stock characters, the over the top insane villain by Michael Shannon and the feisty, sharp black woman by Octavia Spencer, respectively. The first definitely seemed overdone and the latter was a little cliche for me, especially with the line, ""What am I doing, interviewing the help?"" (must be a reference to Spencer's 2011 Academy Award winning role). <br/><br/>Unexpected laughs, mostly from my favorite character, Giles. ""Cornflakes were invented to prevent masturbating."" Giles goes to a bakery everyday to collect Key Lime Pie he hates because he likes the owner. He tries to force Elisa to eat it with him, but it gives her a deep green tongue. Another time is when Elisa continuously signs ""Fuck You"" to Strickland, clearly driven to near madness, demands Zelda to translate, who tells him she is saying ""Thank You"". In the final scene, as The Asset comes back to life after he shoots him several times, Strickland exclaims, ""Fuck. You are a God!""<br/><br/>Giles is an advertising artist and sketches gorgeous pictures of the creature. He watches black and white musicals, which leads to one of the best fantasy scenes in the film, Elisa and the creature are in black and white, Elisa magically has her voice, and the two of them dance and sing, with a band playing in the background. Old films are often playing at The Orpheus. An important one is ""Ruth"", which features the line most famously read during weddings, ""Do not urge me to leave you or to return from following you. For where you go I will go, and where you lodge I will lodge. Your people shall be my people, and your God my God. Where you die I will die, and there will I be buried. May the Lord do so to me and more also if anything but death parts me from you."" what could be more fitting for this life changing love affair? <br/><br/>At first, I had mixed feelings on the ending. The more I thought about it, though, it was perfect, following the theme of an adult fairy tale. Once known only as The Asset to the Cold War powers, the creature is now everything to Elisa. He not only heals her, but transforms her childhood scars into gills, providing her the ability to be with him forever. That is what she wants most of all, after all. <br/><br/>When Giles first meets The Asset, he is taken aback and his first words, quite plainly, are ""He's so beautiful"". He is surprised, and maybe we are a little as well. Like Elisa, these characters are not conventionally beautiful. I would say the same regarding ""The Shape of Water"". It is so unique, so weird, so whimsical. A sui generis. But somehow it works. And stunningly beautiful it is, emotionally and visually. <br/><br/>#FilmReview"

","This is my first review thanks for reading. I looked forward to seeing this film months before it came out. I saw it the day it came out. I won't give a synopsis, there are already plenty of them. Let me give my insight on why this film is such a magical wonder. <br/><br/>First, the story telling. Del Toro is known as the master story teller and with good reason. He can simply tell a great story. He is able to take history, apply fantasy emenents, and create a true wonder. Using the Cold War as the background for his story, Del Toro creates an amphibious man that is unable to speak but clearly has the ability and desire to communicate. <br/><br/>Also, the themes of racism and discrimination were present in this film. They were very subtle however and I did not feel like they were being forced down my throat like so many other movies do today. So many directors focus so much on those themes that it ditracts from the story. Del Toro created a story with those elements without the viewer losing focus of the incredible story that is happening. <br/><br/>The score was incredible. The acting incredible. There is a reason the academy selected this film for 13 oscars, and while only securing 4 of them it is still very clear to me why this is the best picture of 2017."
"hellraiser7","10","43","84","3 January 2018"," Love Runs Deep
","One of the best things for me about the fantasy genere is the romance aspect. Most of the best love stories come from this genere, I feel though it we have not just more creative freedom but the freedom to express what we geniuely feel. It's also expresses our deep seeded believe that someone somewhere is one for us and the struggle we go though to find and stay with them.<br/><br/>Del Toro is one of my favorate movie directors and believe or not this is my favorate movie from him and one of my favorate films in general. This is another kind of film I can't help but feel was almost made for me as it has three of the things I love in most movies; monsters, fantasy, and romance. The premise isn't exactly anything new but it's really more in it's execution that makes it stand out.<br/><br/>There are just so many great things from the cinematography and production value which is great. I really like how it recreated early 1960s era which was a time of chaos from bigotry and intolerance on all sides but also great change as minorities were struggling for equal rights. <br/><br/>Music is just fantastic, the orchastratic score is just beautiful as it just perfectly captures what's happening but most importantly the feelings of both Eliza and the Creature and who they are as characters. However the best thing for me is the song ""You Never Know"" which is just wonderful and perfectly reflects the relationship.<br/><br/>Characters are great from the supporting charcters; Richard Jenkins and Octavia Spencer are great as Eliza's friends, there is great back and forth between them but I like how well rounded both characters are as we get some depth on them to show the commonality all three have as each of them are struggling and dealing with intolerance on all fronts and forms.<br/><br/>Michael Shannon is good as a villain you plain hate as he is a monster in the guise of authority. Theres an interesting character study about him is we get depth into his diseased psyche as he is literally a product of his time, a man living on fixed notions on what a person is supposed to be, which justifies why change or anything different that threats his infastruction shouldn't be aloud. But little does he know or a creeping awareness is he's just part of a dying breed because all those notions are bull crap, despite all the things he has in his life like the teal Cadalac, the whole American dream package he's never content because it's all materialistic there is nothing spiritually going on in his life which makes him spiritually empty.<br/><br/>But of coruse what really makes this film are both Eliza and the Creature. Elsa and the Anphibian Creature are another one of my favorate fictional couples in my book up there with Misa and Hikaru in ""Macross"" and many others on my list, because like any romance story done right I actually care about both characters. The chemistry between both of them is just beautiful, I really was invested into their connection, despite their differences their feelings for each other are human.<br/><br/>Sally Hawins is just great as Eliza, it's probably my favorate role from her. I'll level with you I actually have a crush on this actress believe or not. Sure she doesn't look like someone from the damn CW which makes it all the better. Personally I think she's beautiful inside and out, I really love here character and she's relatable as I'm not a person that talks much either. Despite a lonely soul, her mute condition and not living in the greatest circumstances she never lets it get her down, she's socialable, she has dreams, even like that she knows how to have fun as we see her display some dancing talent.<br/><br/>The Anphibian Creature is great played of coruse by make up and costume actor Doug Jones. The design is great it's all practically there's no CGI bull crap, it really looks like something that could really exist. The creature is a fascinating character despite a mute and not much depth but I find sometimes what you don't say you say a lot. I love that there is mystery to him as you wonder if it's one of the meza god's from Mayan Legend, the God Nepturn from Greek Mythology, a creature seen or even worshiped from the lost civilizations like Atlantis or may'be even the mermaid creatures we heard of from fairy tales, as well as certain abilities of his which show as Shakespere put it ""There are more things in heaven and earth."" However it's really in it's behavior that makes us really connect and sympathize because his childlike curiousity and feelings make him very human.<br/><br/>What makes the chemistry truly unique is that it's non verbal which to me is the best approach; it avoids a fundamental problem most romance films have where sometimes both characters go into a bunch of meaningless melodramatic prattle that really dampins the story. Personally in romance stories I find the quiet physical expression the best parts because both characters are expressing what they truly feel for one another.
Despite communicated in silence you can hear them loud and clear from not just their sign language but also just physicality which made the connection all the more genuine and beautiful. As Old Pete once said, ""If love is really true, it doesn't need an answer.""<br/><br/>There are a lot of beautiful moments between the two like two scenes seeing both Eliza and him underwater together, which was like seeing a dance from how they move and float together. And there is one dream sequence which was great as it's a throwback to some of the old Hollywood musicals, let alone suprising seeing Sally sing and dance which I knew nothing about.<br/><br/>The film does a good job at touching upon the issue of racism as well as other themes like the power of indiviuals and miniorities over corrupt powers and the infaststures built on their lies, the meaning of true humanity. But most importantly the universality of love and how there are no barriers or differences.<br/><br/>Elsa and the Creature's love for each other just like the depths of the ocean runs deep.<br/><br/>Rating: 4 stars"
"Raven-1969","10","67","137","23 September 2017"," Thrilling, Touching and Surreal Exploration of the Heart; Both Human and Monster
","To be seen and desired for who we truly are; it is the passionate wish of many. For Elisa, an unassuming and kind-hearted maid in a 1960s era government lab, this wish is granted in an unusual way. Virtually invisible and isolated, yet content in her little bubble, Elisa is lured from this comfort zone as she witnesses the arrival of a strange, monstrous sea creature in the lab. Despite warnings to keep her distance, Elisa sympathizes with the suffering creature. It is in chains and tortured by Strickland, a sadistic and violent government agent. This wild creature is impulsive. It responds to aggression with the same, and to kindness with kindness. As the cruelty of Strickland escalates, Elisa decides she must act to save the creature. Friendly and opposing forces emerge from unlikely places to help or hinder her. Love and light hinge on the erratic hearts of monsters and humans alike.<br/><br/>This thrilling, touching and surreal film explores the many forms and aspects of monsters. The worst monster of them all is the human heart, and yet it is also the most kind and beautiful. The film offers apt encouragement to speak up and act when others are in trouble and in pain. In this world of rising fascists who peddle hatred and opposition to science, art, sympathy and basically to all humanity, such encouragement is sorely needed.<br/><br/>With expressive eyes and strong empathy, Sally Hawkins is amazing and mesmerizing in her portrayal of Elisa. Michael Shannon is perfectly cast as the crude, cruel, sarcastic and controlling Strickland. In Strickland's sinful, selfish and negative world, the monster is better off dead. The supporting cast is wonderful. The film is full of depth and splendor. The Southern United States is the setting, yet the film was shot in Toronto. The theater that appears prominently on screen is the very same theater (the Elgin) in which I saw the film at the Toronto International Film Festival. I went into the theater with high hopes and was not disappointed."

"breheneyjames","9","47","93","26 February 2018"," A sweet, romantic creature feature.
","'The Shape of Water' is co-written and directed by Guillermo del Toro and stars Sally Hawkins as Elisa, a mute woman working in a 1960's US government lab which is harboring an aquatic Amazonian creature which she falls in love with and decides to save from the grasp of the American and Russian governments. The cast is rounded out by Octavia Spencer, Richard Jenkins, Michael Stulhbarg and Michael Shannon. <br/><br/>This film along with 'Dunkirk' is one of the finest technical achievements of the year boasting stunning cinematography (particularly the effect of camera seemingly floating on water the whole time), beautiful production design and a seductive old Hollywood-style score. The story of outsiders coming together to help another is absorbing and heartwarming and is greatly helped by remarkable performances across the board but particularly by Sally Hawkins who is mesmerizing without saying a word. Richard Jenkins is also noteworthy as Elisa's neighbor and friend Giles giving a sensitive, subdued but standout turn. Octavia Spencer and Michael Stulhbarg are also decent as Elisa's friend and work partner who serves as comedy relief and a soviet spy with a conscience respectively. <br/><br/>Michael Shannon plays a very typical villain for a fairy tale and while his performance is passable, his character is underwritten and comes off as a mustache twirler. Other than this one flaw however, the movie is superb coasting on del Toro's superb direction and a phenomenal cast. Highly recommended."
"chrisvonoot","2","65","133","9 January 2018"," REALITY CHECK
","I gave this film two stars; one for Guillermo Del Toro because he is a truly talented man and one star because when this film shined, it really shined. The performances were excellent. The directing was what we have come to expect from Guillermo Del Toro. But, that's about it.<br/><br/>The film started out rather well. The plot was taking shape very nicely and there was some good character development in the little time afforded for that purpose. The plot was moving along smoothly and then, without any warning whatsoever, the wheels came off. Our dear Eliza falls in love and has sex with the fish man in a bathroom turned into a love pong with nothing more than a few towels jammed under the door to stop up the water flooding from sink and tub.<br/><br/>Ok....after some deep breaths and a few silent ""wtf's"" muttered under my breath to myself, I was able to manufacture just enough suspension of disbelief to wash it down. Perhaps the ending would convince me to overlook this nonsense?<br/><br/>Nope. Not a chance. It only got worse.<br/><br/>The entire film crashed at precisely the when Eliza and the frog man actually performed a choreographed number where Eliza lip-syncs the words to a song about how much she loves Charlie, the Tuna, complete with big band, fake stars and a really shiny, black dance floor. Its been a very long time since I have witnessed such a laughable, cringe worthy scene. I mean, what the happened here? At what point during the script reviews and edits DIDN""T someone raise their hand and say ""ya know, this is kinda stupid?"" <br/><br/>If this was an attempt to artfully convey the sentiment of ""love is blind"" or ""the heart wants what it wants"" or ""love can break down the barriers of whatever is in its way"", then, that attempt failed.......horribly....painfully......pathetically.....tragically. The fact that this film earned a Golden Globe is a testament to how the industry is still afraid to call out the king and his new clothes. <br/><br/>Do not waste your time with this film. Its two hours of my life I will never get back."

","I am left speechless after just watching this movie. I rarely get this no words feeling after watching a movie, but this one left me so amazed. Michael Shannon delivers an amazing performance as this dark security agent with a mind-blowing psychotic tendency. Richard Jenkins delivers every bit of detail that I would have ever imagined he could. Its absolutely fantastic to experience the relationship between him and Sally Hawkins (who I think delivers the performance of a life time). Together with Octavia Spencer who is brilliant as always, I think they deliver this years best movie. The movie can somehow be a little bit drawn out with very long cuts however the fantastic scenery and amazingly intriguing characters makes completely up for that. This is probably the most weird love story I have seen since Beauty And The Beast however I was left with a feeling og understanding. Its a very relatable film about all the things we as humans are scared of and I think its brilliant. I would recommend anyone to go see this movie! <br/><br/>

"mstellini","2","64","131","6 March 2018"," Shockingly bad
","I was moved to write a review for this film because I was shocked that such a poor and poorly made film could possibly win and Oscar.
The plot is terrible and seems to have been written by a 10 year old. There is absolutely no depth to the characters who are very one dimensional. What is the creature? All we know is that it was captured in South America and revered as a God. The villain is very stereotyped and predictable. There is lots of gratuitous gore and naked scenes which contribute absolutely nothing to the storyline and just make the watcher very uncomfortable. And what a ridiculous storyline!! A woman falling in love at first sight with a queer monster of another species. Loving another species is one thing but just suddenly ripping of her clothes and making love to it is just bizarre and distasteful.
And yet the story could have been great if they tried to keep that fairy like quality. This just hit the rocks as soon as the gore, the sex scenes and the perverted behavior of the villain.
How, but how could this film win an Oscar?"

"maurice_yacowar","10","27","50","8 January 2018"," Mute woman saves natural creature from vicious governments
","So what is the shape of water anyway? 
 Water is a malleable element that assumes the shape of its container. It's a life-force, an inner quality that can't be read from its surface. It has no exclusive shape but is a sustaining presence.
 The same can be said for humanity. Humanity is an essential quality that can be found in any number of forms. Here it propels the mute Eliza, the struggling gay artist Giles and reluctant help Delilah, and it is embodied in the mysterious amphibian monster. That natural humanity has been trapped by the US army which intends either his live dissection or his murder to serve the government's fears. 
 That merman seems godlike in his healing powers. That's because he is a creature of nature, not the species man so long removed from it. He restores Giles' hair, disappears his wound, cures his own bullet-holes - and ultimately brings eternal life via love to Eliza. 
 As an orphan Eliza Esposito is cut off from any earthly roots, but she has an instinctual connection to the source of life, water. Hence her immediate attraction to and sympathy for the merman. She persuades Giles to help save him because of their common humanity, theirs and the merman's. 
 Her job reduces her to cleaning the masters' piss, blood and excrement. But her humanity has profounder roots than anyone else here. In the opening scene she is asleep and freed into her natural state - floating in an ocean that fills her room, all the furniture bobbing about, until she eases back down to her sofa and awakens into her lesser world, mundane reality. While her egg-timer ticks off her breakfast, she masturbates in her tub, exulting in her freedom, fullness and immersion. 
 The film does have a fish out of water, but it's not the merman. It's the pie-clerk, a bigot from Ottawa who fakes the chain's ""Southern Hospitality.""
 The film also has an obscene monster but it's not the merman. It's the director Strickland. As he grinds his candies and scarfs painkillers he pretends to civilized order, discipline, citizenship, potency, but he's the film's biggest loser. He tortures the merman monstrously, sexually threatens Eliza, demeans her and her partner Zelda, and so provokes the audience's proper rejection that we cheer when his new Cadillac gets crunched. 
 Like water and humanity, manhood cannot be characterized by its outer appearance or shape. Zelda has bigger balls than her cowardly husband Brewster. Despite his failure as an illustrator, the gay and lonely Giles proves manlier than Strickland when he helps free the merman, from driving the rescue laundry van to knocking down Strickland to enable the escape. 
 So, too, the merman's flat groin unfurls a sexual potency that fulfills Eliza and brings them eternal love. This while Strickland loses his fingers, which even after reattachment turn black and putrid. He may have saved his ""pussy finger"" but he's ultimately emasculated.
 Guillermo del Toro pointedly sets the film in1950s America. That's the America that the current Republican government aims to restore. Hence the pie-clerk's and Strickland's racism, the clerk's homophobia, Strickland's sexism, classism and complacent materialism. Strickland is sure ""The Lord's image"" is his, not black Zelda's and certainly not the merman's. Indeed, he loses the trail when he snaps ""What am I doing, interviewing the shit cleaners?""
 As the five-star General Hoyt admonishes him, ""Decency is what we export. We don't use it ourselves."" Their attack on the merman evokes Trump's evisceration of the EPA, his revival of the murderous coal industry and lately to pillage the national parks and to mine the entire seacoast with oil drilling. To Strickland the mysterious captive natural power is only ""the asset"" - as negative a positive as one could assign a living creature. 
 Though the Russians are as murderous as the American's, the Russian scientist spy Hofstetler articulates the human value: ""I don't want an intricate, beautiful thing destroyed!"" We don't have to be restricted to our government's inhumanity. 
 Though the film is framed with shots of Eliza floating in a watery world, first during her dream, then liberated with her merman, the film has another frame, Giles's narration. He tells the story. As he admits its mystery and his incomprehension it represents his blossoming into a fuller self as well as Eliza's. 
 Initially he's an ex-alcoholic failure struggling to get work drawing ad designs. That's a very '50s profession, sustaining a false dream-life for American consumerism as false as the fantasies screened in the Orpheum under Giles' and Eliza's flats. Encountering the merman liberates him too. Giles starts drawing emotional representations of the strange creature and his connection to our humanity. Giles switches his hand and his imagination from selling a false image of happiness to probing our wilder possibilities."

","There are all sorts of different movies going on in cinemas: documentaries, true stories, thrillers, detectives, dramas, fairytales, animation, etc.. What genre would you characterize The Shape of Water to be? I would say it's a work of art. <br/><br/>Most of the things we watch lately are ""based on a true story"" and as helpful and educational as it is, it defeats the purpose of art. Art is about expanding your imagination, going above your limits. Exploring ideas that are unreal but yet create real emotions and reactions. <br/><br/>I have seen decent amount of movies and one thing that will make me always appreciate the work is the artistic side of it. How innovative was the technique director used? How were the scenes shot? What angle did the camera men take? <br/><br/>The story itself plays certain role - it's the main idea that the whole movie is circled around, but HOW you tell a story is equally if not more important for a storyteller. Think about it in a conventional way - we all have friends who can tell the most boring story with enthusiasm and make people laugh, while others can bore you even while talking about intriguing concepts. Same happens with cinematography - talent to tell a story is what cinematography is about, if we look at it at it's very origin. <br/><br/>For that, I have to say that Guillermo del Toro remembers what is ART, it's purpose and tricks of great storytelling. <br/><br/>I don't want to go into a deep analyse of the movie as it was not made to be thought through million times. It was made to be watched and enjoyed as you watch it. If I were to judge HOW it's made I'd give it a firm 10. The story itself is where I lost 3 points. The story is not original, ""Beauty and the Beast"" variation with more hardcore characters and grimy dark turns along the way that give this green movie a beautiful red contrast (the movie is shot in green-ish tones with a lot of blood in scenes)<br/><br/>It definitely triggers some questions about our tolerance to each other. Where do we really draw the line between human and inhuman. How and WHY do we get to decide what lives and what dies? <br/><br/>So if you really want some food for your brain, you can find it as well. But I wouldn't recommend taking this movie too deep. Guillermo did an incredible job on creating this beautiful world, that you can watch 2 or 3 times and still don't catch all the details of, so, for the art's sake, dive in with open eyes and ears, take in the whole experience and breath out when you leave the theater. It's quite a magical journey."

","12/24/17. Saw this in the theater today and it was worth the price of admission. For those who remember the Creature from the Black Lagoon, then this one's for you. It's a sequel that was well worth the wait. Well, it's not exactly a sequel, it's more like a theme in variation. It's a love story of strange proportions, that is worthy of del Toro's imagination. Hawkins is a sad woman of a certain age, who does janitorial duty at an oceanic research facility. She does not speak, but she can hear. She falls in love with a creature dragged in my Shannon's character. And, typical of sci-fi/creature features of the '50s, anything that is not human deserves to die. Hawkins makes it her mission to save the creature while falling in love with it. Implausible? Sure. Romantic? Absolutely. Catch it for Hawkins's star turn. Let's hope she wins something for this role."
"Quinoa1984","10","25","46","23 December 2017"," ""Life is made of the shipwreck of your plans.""
","In brief, with Guillermo del Toro's The Shape of Water, it's like how you might see a hacky critic say it: I laughed, I cried, I watched the other (first) awesome Doug Jones, and witnessed one of the most gorgeous and moving films of my lifetime. Maybe one of those isn't the usual thing, but you get what I mean.<br/><br/>Longer: Del Toro is a filmmaker so engaged with how people make choices in stories and how the world around them and what is inside them is sometimes at odds and other times really not so, and how that steers a story in a particular direction. Fantasy is often his vehicle and it's to the point where he is so engaged with it that he deals with it directly as reality, or at least he gives it that texture; this is a film where reality and fantasy coalesce into something that is so tactile, pure, wondrous and it's unlike something you've seen before while being reminiscent of many things you've seen before. Pan's Labyrinth was one such way of going about that, and The Shape of Water belongs into that pantheon of a master working with a sharp focus on what he wants and having the cast and craftsmen to pull off his vision. <br/><br/>The movie may belong to a lot of actors actually - Michael Shannon's sympathetic and yet hateful ""big bad wolf"" in this aquatic 60's cold-war spy-tinged fairy tale; Michael Stuhlbarg's Russian agent who actually has a lot of concern for science and what this creature could mean past its ""icky"" insides; Octavia Spencer as someone who on the surface appears to be the chatty best friend type (not unlike in a movie that might have come out in the 50's and 60's, whether she would have been played by a black actress I don't know, possibly not), and has to endure the same kind of racism mixed with sexism as nearly all women then; Richard Jenkins, getting many award nominations and deserves them all, as a closeted artist who is not defined by his sexuality (his hair is as much of importance as who he finds attractive, or his cats) - but, with all those noted, it's the Sally Hawkins show. She commands this with a face that is warm and inviting and a little quirky (maybe like a more tolerable Amelie, I'm sure silent comedians or Giuleta Massina from Fellini's films works in there too), and when she listens to people not like her or the typical-to-1962 worldview she's curious and definitely not dismissive. Oh, and she pleasures herself too, so the sexual active part is not submerged, so to speak.<br/><br/>So when this Amphibian Man character, the most creative homage to Creature from the Black Lagoon since that film came out, is engaged by her, it's not like some kind of thing that's too overly quirky or about their differences (so, as good as this movie was, it's not Starman for example). It's about two outsider souls coming together, physically and emotionally (but, at times, certainly physically, though the most, uh, tasteful depiction one might care to see), and how the world around them is... well, it's a fish-man, kill it with fire! Actually, that's how it would have been in the previous generation, and Del Toro knows this. Moreover, he connects that to the political temperature of the period, which is, frankly, a mood that is not unlike at all what we have now. It's a distinctly American story too, and coming from a Mexican filmmaker that's not to be underestimated.<br/><br/>But what makes The Shape of Water so remarkable, among the towering pieces of cinema this decade, is how seemingly effortlessly the emotion runs through this thing, and how Del Toro and his cinematographer and production designer and composer Alexandre Desplat and Doug Jones and so on, manifests that in total cinematic terms. He brings us through every step like a storyteller should to get us to empathize with most of these characters and even, dare I say, understand and see Shannon's guy as a tragic figure, the ""All-American"" who's been force-fed a lot of garbage and not only accepts it but wants to live up to it (a scene where his boss explains what decency means to him is the most 2017 scene that will ever be, but extends past that). <br/><br/>This is a world that is not all wholly original and doesn't pretend to be - Hawkins and Jenkins live above a movie theater for (Fish-Man) God's sake - but it's sincere in a way that other filmmakers might have found cheaper, or even to the point of not trusting (or simply seeing at all) an actress like Hawkins can be this person. This is beautiful work on all the levels a piece of cinema should be, alive and provocative politically, romantically, in gender, in just how to LIVE in this world with one another. And, maybe, how to look at how we view ourselves in relation to God, or Gods or whatever."

","Another very satisfying GDT movie, very reminiscent of Pan's Labyrinth. Lots of the technical aspects, such as score, makeup of Doug Jones, scene shooting and cuts, and acting performances of Hawkins and Jenkins, were really impressive and help explain why it's got a good chance at Best Picture. I really like the themes they touch on, with the Cold War, love and understanding, loyalty and hierarchy, and very clearly defined and developed characters. However, I didn't find these themes to be extremely deeply or consistently explored, as none of them are especially vivid, emphasized, or concluded in a way that makes you reconsider the idea - they were smaller pieces to a beautiful movie about the main character finding love and understanding. Nothing wrong with that, and it was well done, but nothing that makes it especially memorable or emotionally intense. Very solid, well-directed, and good peripherals, but nothing that puts it over the top."

The cinematography, production design, visual effects, and music score are all top-notch, making the viewing experience rather pleasant. It is surely a strong contender in the technical categories of the coming Oscars. <br/><br/>The acting performances are also noteworthy. Sally Hawkins, Michael Shannon, Octavia Spencer, Richard Jenkins and Michael Stuhlbarg all give unforgettable and natural acting. Michael Shannon proves again why he is one of the best actors in his generation by perfectly playing the villain. <br/><br/>The storytelling and character development, on the other hand, are not that satisfying. Overall speaking, the pace is fine and taut. But the third act is overlong, and some interactions between ""the thing"" and humans (after people rescue ""the thing"" from the lab) are completely unnecessary. The director may try to make the audiences emotionally resonant, but fails in the end. The love between Elisa and ""the thing"" looks especially strange: no human wants to make love with a monster. The character development is largely disappointing in the sense that almost every character is flat and one-dimensional. <br/><br/>All in all, I would give the film a 75/100 rating."

","The Shape of Water, the Oscar winning film about an unlikely love between a humanoid amphibian and a mute woman set in the early 1960's.

The movie will have you shed tears, in suspense, and thrilled by shocking twists and events.<br/><br/> ""Unable to perceive the shape of you, I find you all around me / Your presence fills my eyes with your love, It humbles my heart, For you are everywhere.""

","The mainstream audiences apparently struggled to enjoy this film by Guillermo del Toro, but critics and the academy alike enjoyed it. The comparison to Beauty and the Beast is understandable, but not quite accurate. The idea of social injustice and how immigrants are treated hits closer to home, and for those looking for a hidden message, sure why not. But what happened to just good old fashion storytelling? Do we really need an angle, or a strong political message? <br/><br/>The Shape of Water spins a beautiful yarn of two characters in love. Is it forbidden love? Of course. But more importantly it's the kind of love where these two only exist for each other. The film's closing narrative of a poem does an excellent job of explaining ""The Shape of Water"", which is the expression and theme of their love in the story. Michael Shannon continues to be the consummate bad guy, while Sally Hawkins tip toes into the unknown for quite a strange role. Substance is lacking nowadays in most movies so it's no wonder why it took home the Oscar. Watch this film for a good story that moves well, and delivers in the end."

"aciessi","7","24","44","20 December 2017"," I'm in love with the Shape of you.
","When The Shape of Water started rolling the opening credits, I thought to myself, what could I have gotten myself into? Something about this particular project seemed beautiful, but completely off-putting, even in 2017. There is no secret as to what this film is. A semi-erotic romance picture about a woman and an amphibian humanoid. You might say it's Guillermo del Toro's Beauty and the Beast, as put through the lens of a 1950's Universal Monster Movie, or perhaps there's something more? I take it that del Toro, despite being a well-versed horror movie historian, wasn't just taking a trip down memory lane. I still can't put my finger on what, but The Shape of Water is a provoking piece of art. With all the gorgeous sets, special effects and ensemble cast, I saw the film with an audience of people that weren't necessarily pleased with what they saw. The Shape of Water is no crowd pleaser and I believe del Toro wanted it that way.<br/><br/>The film takes place in the early 1960's. Hawkins is a mysterious figure. Elisa Esposito. A mute woman who works as a janitor at a government lab. Surrounding her is a world of stereotypes. Her partner at home is Giles, a starving artist and closeted homosexual with a tendency to hoard Key Lime pie, played impeccably by the great Richard Jenkins. Octavia Spencer plays Zelda Fuller, Elisa's loyal friend from work. Then we are introduced to Colonel Richard Strickland, the film's clear antagonist. He is our Gaston. The straight, broad shouldered, bigoted white man who discovered the poor amphibian creature, and rather than being fascinated by it, he simply wants to crush it for being different. While he's a villain that's easy to hate, there isn't much nuance to his character in comparison to Jenkins and Spencer. He's a brutish thug and that's about it. Although, I got a kick out of his candy addiction and his willingness to dislocate his blackened, gangrene-infected fingers out of anger. del Toro is a brilliant absurdist.<br/><br/>Any time Hawkins and the creature shared screen time, either together or by themselves, I fell in love. Hawkins is a revelation. She says not a word, but projects an emotional performance louder than any acting job you saw at the movies in 2017. I couldn't keep my eyes off of her. She mesmerized me and filled my heart with joy. The creature is an odd updated version of The Creature from the Black Lagoon with fantastical healing powers and a rather nauseating way of copulating. Her romance with the creature comes from a place of loneliness. Two souls, misunderstood and rejected by the world. They were meant for each other. A love so powerful that Hawkins even strikes up the courage to sing ""You'll Never Know"" to it in an unexpected musical number. On the surface, you might say the lesson of the story is ""love isn't skin deep"". True as that may be, you will never get over how odd it is to see Hawkins fall for that terrifying frog monster. But that's the point. Guillermo del Toro doesn't want you to feel aroused. He doesn't even want you to shed a tear for the protagonists. The Shape of Water is entirely a visual experience and a trip through the imagination of a world unlike ours, but placed somewhere in the not so distant past. It isn't reality or fantasy, it's that unrecognizable grey area in between. It's only up to you to figure out what it all really means."
"RNDorrell","7","24","44","11 December 2017"," Love at the interface between water and air
","It's romantic, it's blue-gray-green, it's wet, it's passionate. It's really hard to classify. This film defies any form of convenient categorization, as is typical with the adult fantasy fables crafted by Guillermo del Toro, he of the visually poetic mind. This is lush romance, adult fairy tale, violent cold war thriller, supernatural fable, dark comedy, social justice parable, and horror film, all in one lush, wet, subterranean visual dance.<br/><br/>Del Toro has mixed those ingredients before (with the exception of the dance number dream sequence), most beautifully in his master work from 2006, ""Pan's Labyrinth."" And he brought captivating, otherworldly mysticism to sequences of the two Hellboy films he directed. His films glue the eyes to the screen. You cannot look away.<br/><br/>Here, not all of this exotic mix works, but the parts that do work, Really work, and are decorated by lush production design by Paul Austerberry, many shades of blue-gray-green. A joke is made about it when a ""teal"" car gets purchased in the plot. The love affair is the most effective thread, in an extremely powerful way, as a mesmerizingly emotive Sally Hawkins plays Elisa Esposito, a cleaning woman who is mute. She befriends the ""Asset,"" played with great physical grace by Doug Jones, an amphibian man who is the subject of a cruel government experimentation program under way in a murky underground lab in Baltimore. Think Creature of the Black Lagoon treated as a Cold War asset. The Amphib-man is intelligent, peaceful at heart, and is graced with amazing healing powers, he was worshiped as an aquagod by the locals in the Amazon basin, before he was captured and brought in a tank to the States.<br/><br/>Elisa yearns for a soulful connection, and as she joins the overnight cleaning crews at the lab, she draws the Amphib-man out, tempting him with hard-boiled eggs and Benny Goodman records. She teaches him Sign. He teaches her about his pure heart. The year is 1962, and the lab's secret government staff seek a leg up on the Soviets. It's thought the Amphib-man's unique twinned breathing systems could yield an advantage in the space race.<br/><br/>That thread is mostly window dressing, it doesn't work so well as did the fight between partisans and fascists in the Spanish Civil War context that was so deftly applied to ""Pan's Labyrinth,"" but it serves to lay out a twisted homicidal antagonist, a true believer, Col. Strickland, played by Michael Shannon with sadistic perversion. It's amazing to contrast these heavy roles he gets now with his part as Fred, the Wrestle Mania fan from ""Groundhog Day."" As Strickland blithely tortures the Amphib-man and domineers his yellow-housed family, Elisa flies under his radar and enlists her coworker Zelda (Octavia Spencer) and best friend from her apartment building, Giles (Richard Jenkins), to spring the Amphib-man from his laboratory prison, with an assist by a sympathetic scientist, Dr. Hoffstetler, played with a proud ethical posture by Michael Stuhlbarg, amidst a subplot of Soviet spying (which also doesn't work so well; I would have preferred more of the budding human-Merman romance thread).<br/><br/>Spencer's Zelda is the film's incisive comic relief, and she can read Elisa's moods in detail, setting up a mirthful exchange when Zelda discovers that Elisa has ... consummated her bond with the Amphib-man. The line, and the explanatory miming, is flatly hilarious, I won't spoil it. Zelda is Elisa's workplace touchstone, her defender and translator, her unquestioning friend. Spencer hits a home run with the role, another one for her after ""Hidden Figures.""<br/><br/>Jenkins is also fantastic, as professional illustrator Giles, fired from his ad agency because he's gay, and bereft of the special contact of love, which is also Elisa's condition. She struggles to express to Giles why she loves the Amphib-man: ""When he looks at me, he does not see how I am incomplete."" (Her muteness.) ""He just sees Me."" Giles, too, is beguiled by the pure heart of the persecuted merman, despite an unfortunate incident with one of Giles' pet cats. The tragedy of the story is the emotional weight of being alone, a condition shared by Elisa, Giles, and the Amphib-man. None of them are complete, all of them yearn for contact.<br/><br/>About Doug Jones, he of the virtuosity in acting while clad in layers of prosthetic latex: he was the magical Faun, as well as the monstrous Pale Man in ""Pan's Labyrinth,"" he was another merman, Abe Sapien, in the Hellboy films by del Toro, and now he's Lt. Saru in Star Trek Discovery. All roles in which his height and athletic posture help him act sensitively while covered in layers of prosthetics. In this film, he's like Elisa: mute from the human perspective, but his vocalizations are appropriately intense (which were credited to del Toro).<br/><br/>Del Toro simply does not make Hollywood formula films. Every item he directs winds up being a singular entry of entrancing strangeness, some working better than others. But every one of them unique and special. I wonder what he might do with a conventional script, something not immersed in the mists of fantasy. But then again, he seems most happy plumbing those shrouded, tragic, romantic depths. More power to him."

","""Water is like love, it has no shape. It takes the shape of whatever it inhabits. It's the most powerful element in the universe. It's gentle, flexible, but breaks through every barrier.""-Guillermo del Toro<br/><br/>Despite del Toro's love for comics, gothic visuals, giant mechs, and practical monster effects; the famous Spanish director has always been a bit of a romantic at heart as demonstrated by the above quote.<br/><br/>From his more artsy Spanish films (Devil's Backbone, Pan's Labyrinth) to the more mainstream efforts (Hellboy and Pacific Rim), there is a touching reoccurring theme concerning the idea of societal outsiders and marginalized individuals finding solace within each other's company.<br/><br/>With his fascination with fairy tales, it seemed only a matter of time before del Toro took a stab at creating a straight-out romance tale, which comes in the form of his latest feature that gives a great twist to the ""Beauty and the Beast"" concept.<br/><br/>What makes TSOW probably one of del Toro's best films since The Devil's Backbone is that taken on a pure conceptual level, the inter-species romance angle could have easily been awkward and almost kitschy if done by lesser hands. But del Toro's mathematical but delicate storytelling, impressive set designs, and the incredibly layered performances from the silent Sally Hawkins and Doug Jones, despite wearing a thick rubber monster costume, turns TSOW into one of the most touching and honest romance tales in quite a while.<br/><br/>The performances in general are incredible across the board, arguably the best when it comes to del Toro's English-language movie canon. Hawkins is obviously magnetic in the lead but Michael Shannon as the openly racist research team leader Richard Strickland easily joins the canon of Jacinto (The Devil's Backbone) and Captain Vidal (Pan's Labyrinth) in del Toro's brand of genuinely terrifying but tragic human villains.<br/><br/>But the person that I feel really stole the show was Richard Jenkins, playing Elisa's down-on-his-luck friend/neighbor and closeted commercial artist Giles. Giles by far feels like the most down-to-earth character in this fantastical tale and you really do feel sorry for his plight in life. For most of the movie Giles and Elisa's coworker Zelda (Octavia Spencer) have to verbalize the mute Elisa's sign language; giving way to some unique interactions. Giles also provides some great subtle moments of comic relief.<br/><br/>Praise should also be level at the spell-binding score by Alexandre Desplat (The Grand Budapest Hotel, The Imitation Game, Argo), giving a film with admittedly strange subject manner a timeless classy atmosphere that further contributes to the fairy tale quality. The accordion and whistle-heavy music that plays over the film's mesmerizing opening underwater dream sequence was the first sign that I was watching something truly special.<br/><br/>The movie on the whole has a magical Old Hollywood feel to the whole thing, which is something different compared to del Toro's previous efforts. It's not the type of Old Hollywood tribute that feels pandering either (Ex. La La Land), it all feels born out of genuine affection and is completely at the service of painting the film's intoxicating atmosphere.<br/><br/>TSOW on the whole is a pretty unconventional movie that is hard to pigeonhole into a single genre.<br/><br/>It's part ""Beauty Meets Beast"" romance, part creature-feature, part period piece, part fairy tale, part science fiction and part spy thriller. There is also the fact that this is an R-rated del Toro flick and while it's not nearly as violent as Pan's Labyrinth, there are a few scenes that will make you wince or shiver in uncomfortableness.<br/><br/>Even with the trailers it's obvious the distributor's Fox Searchlight Pictures could not crack the egg on how to market the movie. Hopefully it will continue to get more attention due to it's appearance on many critic's ""best of"" lists and with award season underway; but regardless del Toro's latest masterwork is one of the 2017's best."

","Whether it be Creature from the Black Lagoon, Beauty and the Beast, Edward Scissorhands, or even Her from a few years ago, movies about forbidden love are a common theme in romantic films. And if done right, they could be extremely effective. The Shape of Water stands as a fresh take on that tale, and yes it works really well as a romance between a government controlled creature and a mute custodian.<br/><br/>Driven by emotional performances, The Shape of Water feels simple in premise considering we have seen similar stories (mentioned above) almost every year. But it all comes down to execution. Director Guillermo del Toro frames this story as a good guy-bad guy situation, but certainly rounds out each character with emotions and just enough depth to care about every scenario.<br/><br/>In that way, the original screenplay by GDT and Vanessa Taylor could be among the best written this year. Every scene has importance and the 2 hour runtime is perfectly paced. There are also several actors who turn in Oscar caliber performances including lead Sally Hawkins, Michael Shannon, Octavia Spencer, Richard Jenkins, and Michael Stuhlbarg. I would have to go through the other films and put together a list of Oscar predictions, but all actors mentioned above have a chance at a nominations.<br/><br/>GDT has a knack for making gorgeous looking films and The Shape of Water is no different. Everything from the creature played by Doug Jones to the production design and cinematography, this is easily one of the best looking films of the year. To that note, I don't really have a complaint with the film. Performances, writing, directing, visuals, and romance are all way above par. These uniquely executed films are always something I will cherish, and I'm glad GDT was able to bring this to screens, especially before the Fox-Disney merger. It really makes you wonder if we will even get these types of movies once that deal goes down. One can only hope.<br/><br/>9.0/10"
"southdavid","8","23","42","23 April 2018"," Heart Shaped Box
","Really enjoyable and beautifully made, if slightly corny love story that could only have come from the mind of Guillermo Del Toro.<br/><br/>Mute cleaning lady Elisa (Sally Hawkins), works at a secretive Government facility at the height of the cold war. One day, an asset arrives at the lab, a merman dragged from the sea by his handler and now guard Richard Strickland (Michael Shannon). As Strickland and the scientists attempt to gather information about the creature, Elisa secretly uncovers his intelligence and they form a bond. As their relationship deepens, the military decide that vivisection is the only option so Elisa, her neighbour and a reluctant scientist come up with a daring rescue plan. <br/><br/>Like so many of Del Toro's films, ""The Shape Of Water"" is, at heart, a dark violent fairy tale. Full of magic and wonder, its implausibility doesn't really stand up to a lot of scrutiny - but that's not the point. The film is about connection. Elisa struggles for connection as she is unable to talk, only her neighbour played by Richard Jenkins and her colleague Zelda, played by Octavia Spencer are able to understand her sign language. There's a credibility to her relationship with the creature that stems from this, although perhaps a few more scenes together would have helped sell the risk she takes to try and save him. Richard Jenkins character too is unable to make the connection that he wants in his life, as a gay man in the 1960's. He has presumably lost his job because of this, and risks the dangers of engaging with the much younger man who runs the local diner. Both Zelda and Strickland have unrewarding marriages, which feed into their desire to help or destroy the central couple.<br/><br/>Performances are universally excellent, but special praise must go to Sally Hawkins in what is a daring turn, if playing a Mute wasn't enough, Elisa is entirely naked in several scenes. Michael Shannon Strickland is closer to the thugs and psychopaths he's played previously, but he's still a magnetic presence whenever he's on screen. <br/><br/>The ending is potentially divisive, but Del Toro, seemingly aware that it might be, suggests that it's an interpretation. The other criticism of the plot is that it's pretty predictable. <br/><br/>It's not suitable for children at all, given the sexual content and violence scenes but adults willing to forgive a little contrivance will find much to admire."

"Ed-from-HI","10","23","42","25 December 2017"," Guillermo del Toro works his brilliant Cinematic 'Magic' (plus abundant Compassion) again with Sally Hawkins, Octavia Spencer & Doug Jones (and Michael Shannon) supelative!
","Wow...... ""The Shape of Water"" proves once again that Guillermo del Toro is certainly among the most gifted & genuinely artistic Directors (and Conceptualists) working in films today.<br/><br/>As with his earlier masterpiece ""Pan's Labyrinth"" (El laberinto del fauno) Guillermo del Toro brings multi-layers of complexity and significant meaning to ""The Shape of Water"" primarily being a heartrending (although highly unorthodox) 'Love Story' ...........but perhaps even more importantly revealing deeply-poignant insights within the (partially broken/ lost) hearts & Souls of endearingly-eccentric characters simply searching for a measure of empathy-connection while traversing darkened realms of the unsympathetic & apathetic 'real' World.<br/><br/>Of course Guillermo del Toro has the astonishing ability to take complex moral-dilemma's (and emotional upheavals) adding-in historically resonant back-drops (in this case early 1960's Cold-War) while weaving uniquely-compelling storylines within profoundly-moving and indelible character studies.<br/><br/>In the case of ""The Shape of Water"" focusing on the beleaguered 'Elisa Esposito' who works the night-shift as janitor at the highly-secretive 'Occam Aerospace Research Center' (poignantly & realistically portrayed by Sally Hawkins). 'Elisa' is unable to speak (i.e. mute but not deaf), and communicates solely thru sign-Language, fortunately ""Elisa' has a compassionate friend/co-worker named 'Zelda' to share the grave-yard shift hours with (the fantastically-charismatic Octavia Spencer works her magic here again!)...... and after-work watching old-Classic movies along with intellectual, artist/neighbor, movie-aficionado 'Giles' (Richard Jenkins).<br/><br/>Even with the caring company of 'Zelda' and 'Giles' - 'Elisa' experiences bouts of loneliness, and desires true companionship..... but her inability to verbally 'speak' is of course a bit of a hindrance to finding personal-happiness (this film definitely gives the viewer the impression that 'Elisa' has basically felt 'ignored' and under-valued throughout her entire Life).<br/><br/>'Elisa's Story-arc certainly begins to change the Day a new research 'subject' is brought into the Lab = a large aquatic 'creature' that we only receive glimpses of at first, but one who seems to possesses humanoid form? 'Elisa' is intrigued, and begins to earn this creature's 'trust' by bringing it hard-boiled eggs to snack-on, and record-albums of Music to listen/dance to?,,,, these early interactions between Elisa and the Gill-man (expertly enlivened by Doug Jones, who has brought many of Guillermo del Toro's creatures to vivid 'life') are extremely poignant as the audience begins to realize that this humanoid-amphibian exhibits abundant intelligence + curiosity + genuine emotions, soon endearing itself to Elisa (and vice-versa)....... these significant interactions eventually transforming the initially meek-mild Elisa into a steely-eyed, resolute Lover & 'protector' of the Gill-man (under-siege by those who would rather dissect him in the name of Cold-War scientific supremacy).<br/><br/>There are many more developments (in terms of both Love & intrigue) and the intimidating Michael Shannon perfectly-portrays the 'take-no-prisoners' Col. Strickland (out for amphibian blood), along with Michael Stuhlbarg as the seemingly compassionate scientist (with a secret) who also plays a pivotal role here.<br/><br/>In summation, ""The Shape of Water"" is one of the Best, most emotionally-complex and highly-imaginative movies I have seen in a long time...... one that most definitely lingers and deeply-impacts the viewer's heart & Soul....... but with the brilliant Guillermo del Toro at the helm, I expected no Less!"
"framptonhollis","9","30","57","6 January 2018"," above all it is a film about feelings
","By subverting and paying homage to all sorts of styles and genres, Del Toro creates his own style and his own genre in The Shape of Water, a film that will hopefully live on for generations and be considered a masterful classic by future filmgoers. Many people will hate it (there are already plenty of reviews on this very site that are unreasonably negative, which is always bound to happen when someone creates a work of art that is genuinely beautiful and creative and is also willing to take people out of their comfort zones and be totally weird and have serious moral questions and thought provoking statements to make), but many people will, and should, love it until the end of time. It is a moving, touching, thrilling, frightening, funny, and romantic hybrid of the whimsical fairy tale, the classic Universal monster flick, the Old Hollywood melodrama, the surrealist film, the fantastically foreign art house masterpiece, and probably tons of other things to. The characters are well developed, Del Toro's lens has a profound understanding of human emotion that makes me want to cry as I reflect upon this simply flat out majorly f*cking brilliant movie...that's enough of my talking, just see it!"

","This movie is unusual, odd and queer. I wouldn't come out ld with such an atypical story in a million year, and that's what makes it alluring the fact that it takes you by surprise, that you don't know what to expect. Add to it, it's aesthetically pleasing to the senses and the mind, del Toro's directing is very dynamic and this vintage halo around the movie makes it feels like a mix of Wes Anderson and Spielberg, fused with Amilie and vintage Parisien aesthetics mainly through the music to give this genre-defying romance. Besides, the story is remarkably touching too it's a reflection on loneliness as every characte suffer from it on his own terms from Elisa who's craving for love and being understood, to her friends Zelda who's living with a man who doesn't appreciate nor respect her and Jiles, an old gay guy who mourns not living his younger days fully and truly and afraid it's too late to find someone at his age, plus there is Strickland the antagonist, a depressed ex-soldier bored of his plastic life with a billboard plastic family and professor dimitri who's left out by the bothsides he's working for. They all keep living their monotonous routines until this aquatic God comes and changes it, as he represents closure and release, leading the characters to either find love, find confidence, stand up for themselves or simply find peace in death. The other thing that touched me the most is the love story between Elisa and the Creature as it defies words and norms only relying on feelings and touch, showing us that love is unconventional and universal and count on del Toro to deliver this beautiful message in a beautifully twisted way."

","As soon as I saw the trailer for this movie, I was absolutely hooked. Fantasy romance with Guillermo del Toro directing and writing? Sounded like the perfect combination. <br/><br/>I'm fairly familiar with some of del Toro's other works (Pan's Labyrinth, The Strain, Don't Be Afraid of the Dark, Crimson Peak, etc) many of which I loved, and this movie can be ranked up there with the best of his films. It was visually stunning from beginning to end, with a beautiful dark fantasy like feel throughout each scene. The whole film gives a sense of being underwater with reflective surfaces and gloomy aesthetics, making it absolute gorgeous to watch. <br/><br/>The characters are wonderfully developed. The relationship between Elisa and the Asset is not one we as an audience are unfamiliar with, but presented in a rather unique manner with the presence of various obstacles to their love. The childish innocence of the Asset and Elisa's wit and caring attitude come together in an adorable romance that warms the heart. The side characters offer their own unique quirks to the story and help to lighten some of the action in the film.<br/><br/>This film was so different from many of the others from this year and a welcome change. Highly recommend to those who love romance or tend to be jaded by the genre. There is something in this film for all."

","If you enjoy my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)<br/><br/>Guillermo del Toro proves that his visuals are as impeccable as ever. Such a beautifully directed film, with so much vivid colors and wonderful production design. The editing is flawless, the score is magical and the cinematography is incredibly gorgeous.<br/><br/>Sally Hawkins (Elisa Esposito) has a phenomenal performance. She is able to transmit her feelings in such a classy way and without saying a single word throughout the entire movie. Oscar-worthy display as well as the rest of the fantastic cast. Michael Shannon (Strickland) and Octavia Spencer (Zelda) are great, but Richard Jenkins (Giles) is right up there with Sally. An all-star cast delivers perfect performances that carry a meaningful, romantic and unique story.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, not everything is perfect. The tone and the pacing are a bit unbalanced, but my main issue is the cheesy and predictable third act. Even though the story alone justifies watching this film, some people might find creepy the relationship between Elisa and the Amphibian Man (Doug Jones).<br/><br/>Still, it is a brilliant screenplay with a lot of important messages and del Toro does an outstanding job directing The Shape of Water, which will surely get him a win at the 90th Academy Awards. It does not do enough for entering my Top10: Best Movies of 2017, but it gets a well-deserved Honorable Mention."

","I saw no mention of Paul Zindel's name as this same story was on TV in 1969 with Ruth White and in 1990 with Jean Stapleton. The Dolphin has become a genertic experiment.

"billcr12","9","22","40","10 January 2018"," Del Toro's Magic
","Guillermo Del Toro continues the magic he started with Pan's Labyrinth, my favorite movie of 2006, and Roger Ebert's. Sally Hawkins stars as a mute woman living in isolation who works at a top secret government facility who have captured a reptile like being who looks like the creature from the black lagoon. Del Toro was obviously influenced by 1960's American movies and television. Michael Shannon plays the requisite sadistic bad guy in charge of keeping the half man, half beast tamed, often with a cattle prod. Hawkin's, of course, falls in love with the lizard man and must help to save him from the evildoers. The Shape of Water is not a children's fairy tale, as Hawkins is often quite naked in the film. Along with Three Billboards outside Ebbing, Missouri and Get Out, I would be satisfied with any number of Oscar's for all three."
"Lewis_Heather787","8","22","40","8 January 2018"," Strange concept............... Brilliant execution!!!!!!!
","Now when I first heard of this film and subsequently watching the trailer, I was left wondering how on earth this film could actually work with such an outlandish story. Oh wow has Mr. Del Toro pulled this one off in some style it must be said, this film is full of surprises.<br/><br/>Firstly, even the idea of having a main character that is mute and doesn't speak a word is extremely ballsy because it is essential it works otherwise the film would not stand up and audience will not connect to it. Wow just wow is the performance from Sally Hawkins just fantastic and even though she conveys most of her emotions and thoughts through sign language, its the looks and mannerisms of the character that are brilliantly done. You as the audience can tell straight away the feelings of her character with the smallest emotion on her face or body language, top class acting and she 100% deserves awards for this. <br/><br/>All the other performances are all again really strong, the other highlights I would say are Richards Jenkins and Michael Shannon. Both bring there A game to the table on this film, Jenkins is a lonely heart warming character out of time. Whilst Shannon is just born to play a bad guy and he is so menacing even though in reality he is an every day guy with a family just doing his weird........very weird job. <br/><br/>The directing from Guillermo del Toro is sublime you can tell the time and effort that have been put into creating this film, ever shot is done perfectly. The camera at times moves elegantly through the air, as if you were swimming, it works so perfectly for the era of the film and the central story. Coupled together with the amazing cinematography the film looks spectacular from start to finish. This is a true technical achievement behind the camera.<br/><br/>The last positives are the creature effects and score, both of which are brilliant. Firstly the effects of the creature are brilliant making the creature look so grounded in reality in and strange way as if he could really exist today. Also the score that seamlessly blends in and out of the film complimenting the direction and pace of the film, very good.<br/><br/>Overall its 85 out of 100 or 8.5 out of 10, this film is very good from a technical stand point and with one brilliant performance from Sally Hawkins. The only part I didn't like was this strange singing and dancing scene that made know sense, didn't fit in the film at all. Apart from that this film is great with a central love story that is one of the best that I've scene in a long time from two characters that never speak a word!!!!! Definitely worth peoples time and attention, deserves many awards!!!!"
"bankofmarquis","8","22","40","26 December 2017"," A magical movie
","THE SHAPE OF WATER is the most romantic, beautiful, charming, weird and wonderful love story that I have seen in a long, long time.<br/><br/>The fact that the love story is between a mute woman and the Creature from the Black Lagoon makes it just that much more interesting.<br/><br/>From the fertile mind of Guillermo Del Toro (THE DEVIL'S BACKBONE, PAN'S LABYRINTH), TSOW answers a question that a young Del Toro had when he first saw the 1950's creature feature CREATURE FROM THE BLACK LAGOON. He thought, ""what if the creature ended up with the girl?"" In Del Toro's mind, the Creature was the leading man, not the generic hunk that was hunting him.<br/><br/>Wonderfully realized by Del Toro, TSOW tells the tale of mute cleaning woman, Eliza (Sally Hawkins) who works at a ""secret Government agency"" in Baltimore. When she is asked to mop blood up in a highly classified area, she soon realizes that a ""creature"" is being held there. It is her realization that this creature is not just ""some creature"", but an intelligent being that starts this lonely, mute woman and the ""creature"" on the road to a loving relationship.<br/><br/>Hawkins is mesmerizing as Eliza. Obviously, with her character being mute, she must express herself in other ways - and she does. Her eyes are truly the window to her soul and Hawkins' ability to ""eye act"" is astounding, she conveys more feeling with a look and a glance than most actors can with a mountain of work.<br/><br/>She is strongly aided by some really good co-stars - Richard Jenkins is marvelous (as always) as Eliza's neighbor/friend who, himself, has a handicap - he is a gay man in the 1950's. The strength of Jenkins' performance is that he is able to overcome the trap of ""the sympathetic gay best friend"" and bring to the screen a complete character. Michael Stuhlbarg is watchable (as always) as the main scientist that studies the creature. Here is an actor that has grown in my eyes and he is a ""must watch"" in anything he is in. Michael Shannon is a presence as the main ""heavy"" in this film and though his character is pretty one-note, Shannon hits that note strongly and holds our attention. Unfortunately, compared to these 3 (and Hawkins' lead role), Octavia Spencer's talents are not put to the test as Eliza's co-worker. She is capable of so much more and her character is severely underwritten.<br/><br/>But, while strong characters are a must in a successful film, it is Del Toro's direction and ""sense of place"" that embue this fable with the character and detail it needs. Set in a 1950's that is a bit more idealistic/stylized than is real, Del Toro steers us through a world that is fascinating to watch - and be in - and makes it seem almost plausible that such a creature could exist and that a woman could fall in love with him.<br/><br/>Much like how I fell in love with this film.<br/><br/>Letter Grade: A-<br/><br/>8 stars (out of 10) - and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)"
"dom-lerose-8","Null","22","40","19 December 2017"," Guillermo Del Toro creates one of the most cinematically beautiful epics of our time.
","Water gives life. Guillermo Del Toro's ""The Shape of Water"" is all about love and life. Few filmmakers create films where you sense the work of a director in every shot, and Del Toro does exactly that. Through his brilliance and creativity, Guillermo Del Toro places himself as one of the best filmmakers of our time with this masterpiece. Set during the Cold War, the mutant janitor of a research facility named Elisa (Sally Hawkins) falls in love with a test subject, which happens to be an amphibian-like creature similar in many ways to a man. With help from her friend Giles (Richard Jenkins) and Zelda (Octavia Spencer), Elisa risks everything to try and save the creature from the wicked government agents trying abusing him, specifically Richard Strickland (Michael Shannon). <br/><br/>Del Toro's unusual love story is simply beautiful. We get many gorgeous shots of water in many forms, symbolizing the different forms of love found throughout life. Del Toro isn't emphasizing that people-creature relationships should be socially accepted, but rather uses their relationship as a mechanism to convey the multiple complexities and layers of love and life. Del Toro crafts a truly beautiful film dedicated to the art of cinema, shining in his details and poetic signatures. Each performance is remarkable, notably the wickedness of the great Michael Shannon and the richness of Sally Hawkins mute but brilliant performance. ""The Shape of Water"" is not only visually beautiful due to its breathtaking cinematography, but conveys a beautiful test on life and love and how love itself takes many different shapes."

"fox_ronan","8","56","115","26 February 2018"," A Modern Fairy Tale
","The Shape of Water has received extensive appraisal from the academy this year, as it currently leads the awards race with a grand total of 13 nominations. The film has garnered a plethora of nominations in the acting, directing and technical categories. Many pundits in fact speculate that it's the favourite to win Best Picture, with Get Out coming in just behind as a close second. Despite the awards buzz, I was rather sceptical of del Torro's new film, as the academy has previously rewarded films that are dull and overly pretentious. Though over the past few years there have been some notable exceptions, for example Titanic and the Lord of the Rings. However, once this fantastical story had concluded and the credits rolled, my scepticism had been completely washed away (no pun intended). <br/><br/>The film tells the story of Elisa Esposito (Sally Hawkins), a mute woman who works as a cleaner at one of the US' research facilities during the height of the cold war. The aforesaid facility is run by the ambitious and cold-hearted Richard Strickland (Michael Shannon), who oversees the transfer of a new research asset. This asset being an amphibious creature uncovered in South America. The film depicts an unconventional love story between Elisa and the creature, a love that has to overcome the cruelty and brutality of this world. A cruelty embodied by the prejudicial and cold Strickland.<br/><br/>Such a fantastical story's believability is wholly dependent on the actor's ability to deliver compelling performances. Which is exactly what this talented cast does, Octavia Spencer and Richard Jenkins deliver both likeability and emotional depth with their characters. Surprisingly, both of their characters are also quite amusing and provide unexpected comic relief. There was a particular gag from Octavia Spencer's character, after shall we say an 'intimate 'moment', that had me laughing out loud. Ergo, what is unsurprising is that both have received acting nods from the academy.<br/><br/>Though to me, the real standout of this stellar cast is Sally Hawkins. She wonderfully portrays a woman isolated from society due to what she feels is an inability to fully articulate herself, among other things. The fact that Hawkins' character is mute means that much of the emotional weight of her character's story is dependent on her ability to express the character's emotions physically. Something that she is able to do with great grace and beauty. There is a particular standout scene where Hawkins's facial expressions and gesticulation, manage to express how this newfound connection has lifted her character from the depths of loneliness to a place of love and acceptance. In my humble opinion, her nomination for best actress is 100% deserved.<br/><br/>Del Torro also excels in his duty as director. He crafts a visually evocative world, which he brings to life by combining creative and colourful cinematography with an authentic 60s soundtrack. I particularly liked how he used water imagery throughout the film to illustrate both isolation and unification.<br/><br/>The film for the most part is impressive all around, but like any movie, it isn't perfect. I would argue that there wasn't enough time dedicated enough to building the connection between Elisa and the creature. It isn't bad by any stretch of the imagination, it's greatest crime is that it's 'good enough', as it adequately serves the purpose of forwarding the narrative. I feel that if more time was dedicated to building their relationship, it truly could have been an iconic cinematic romance. If such time had been invested, I feel that the dramatic climax of the third act would have been far more emotionally impactful.<br/><br/>Despite these flaws, The Shape of Water tells a memorable story. Not because of how it interweaves its different themes using its various characters, but because of the importance of its message. It tells a story of the transcendent nature of love. A story of how love can wash away the trappings of loneliness and transcend the ugliness of prejudice. Guillermo del Torro's simple story has an important message, one that is delivered with emotional honesty, we shouldn't let mere physical attributes and so called 'flaws' tear us apart and isolate us. Rather, we should love well and love freely."

","Guillermo del Toro is back with this visually stunning and thoroughly entertaining adult fairy tale. While this movie does not quite live up to some of his previous films (i.e. ""Pan's Labyrinth,"") it is still a great film in its own right. When one begins to watch the film, the first thing that the viewer will notice is the luscious and stunning visuals. These aesthetic qualities are all the more superb and stunning when one takes a moment to realize that they were done with practical effects rather than CGI. As usual, the visionary style del Toro takes to envision his creature and sets is incredibly impressive. Alexandre Desplat's score, with its simplistic, unpretentious and almost low-key charm, is also thoroughly riveting.<br/><br/>The plot, which centers on a janitor's relationship with a creature kept in a research lab during the Cold War era in Baltimore, is entertaining throughout. The film is paced well, and never drags or feels tedious. The acting on display in the film is good as well, with a solid performance from Sally Hawkins in the lead role, a show-stealing supporting performance by Octavia Spencer, and a darkly powerful turn by Michael Shannon as a supervisor who serves as the film's sadistic villain. It is also important to note how the film is enhanced by its use of classic filmmaking tropes, which are managed well as to feel original rather than clichéd or too old-fashioned. They give the film a unique layer of depth to it that helps work hand-in-hand with its stylish aesthetic and unique mix of charm and darker themes. The only criticism I have of this film is the fact that there is a lack of individualization or characterization of film's supporting characters; these characters seem solely memorable based on a single personality trait. Otherwise, this is a skillfully made fantasy film and one that I would recommend very much. 8.5/10"

","Baltimore, 1962: In the midst of the Cold War, Elisa Esposito (Sally Hawkins) is a young mute woman who works as a janitor in a government laboratory. At her workplace, she becomes intrigued and fascinated by a recently captured man-like sea creature that is confined in a water tank.<br/><br/>This film is courageous in its combining a historical era with fantasy science-fiction. It is occasionally far-fetched (during that paranoid time/place, it's hard to believe Elisa would have such easy, unsupervised access to the lab with the sea-creature) but it is mostly believable within its bizarre, unusual universe.<br/><br/>While it may not live fully up to the awards-hype it is getting, it is still praiseworthy in many ways. Director Guillermo del Toro works with a great team to draw the viewer into his fascinating world especially in two thrilling scenes - one of which is the finale. The cinematography (by Dan Laustsen), the music (by Alexandre Desplat), and the set design team work superbly to recreate a long-ago era through a unique lens. And the cast is equally amazing.<br/><br/>Though Hawkins' performance has many similarities to her recent work in ""Maudie"", she succeeds greatly in the current film to show passion and determination despite her limits in being able to communicate verbally. The other characters and their respective performers are more than noteworthy: Richard Jenkins as Elisa's neighbour - an underemployed homosexual who has trouble with aging and finding work as an illustrator (his personal story could have been even more elaborated); Michael Shannon as a high-ranking official in Elisa's workplace - he's even more monstrous than the sea creature he regards with indifferent contempt; Michael Stuhlbarg as a scientist whose own story provides plot twists; and Octavia Spencer as Elisa's sharp-talking co-worker and loyal friend.<br/><br/>One thing is for certain: ""The Shape of Water"" is in a category of its own. - dbamateurcritic"

The scenery brings us back to a past time in our lives when life was simpler and hidden secrets were in abundance. The screenplay was written by Guillermo del Toro and Vanessa Taylor. Their screenplay is both creative and at the same time haunting. <br/><br/>The cast was perfectly matched. Sally Hawkins plays Elisa Esposito a mute cleaning lady whose partner at work is none other than 2012 Academy Award winner Octavia Spencer who plays cleaning lady Zelda Fuller. These two ladies clean all day mopping up urine from the men's bathroom floor at a government run top secret facility in Baltimore. After work, they go home where Zelda cooks and cleans for her lazy no good husband, and Elisa spends her evenings alone in her bathtub pleasuring herself to the beat of an egg timer.<br/><br/>Then in walks Richard Strickland (played menacingly and true to form by Michael Shannon) with his 3 foot electric prodding cane, and a water contraption that contains some type of amphibious creature that can swim and live in both salt water and stand upright on dry land. Richard Strickland brings this strange beast to the Baltimore facility for scientists such as actor Michael Stuhlbarg who plays Doctor Robert Hoffstetler can study and examine the beast.<br/><br/>One very interesting character that I cannot fail to mention is actor Richard Jenkins who plays Giles, Elisa's co-tenant who both live upstairs from the local Orpheum theater. Giles character is lonely, he is a gay man, a commercial artist with great talent, but apparently without a bright future due to some previous drinking problem. Giles friendship with the mute Elisa is sincere and loving as they both are two lonely individuals looking for something more from life. Richard Jenkins character Giles, has some of the best one-liners I have heard in a long time. One such one liner was ""don't play with the cats"". You will have to see this wonderful film to appreciate Giles hilarious and timely comments.<br/><br/>When Elisa has an opportunity to meet the amphibious creature while cleaning the facility she immediately forms a bond with the creature. They communicate by hand gestures and by heart felt facial expressions which eventually lead to a romantic relationship. Michael Shannon's role as Richard Strickland is a take no prisoners type of character and he plays a despised overseer of the creature who punishes the creature at will and for his own pleasure. <br/><br/>Elisa realizes that if she does not react quickly to free the creature from his captivity he will surely die at the insistence and obstinate hand of Richard Strickland. So we the audience are kept in suspense on how will the meek and mild mute cleaning lady Elisa who has affection for the creature successfully save the creature?<br/><br/>I felt the escape plan was executed with great suspense and curiosity and contained some of the best scenes by writer/director Guillermo del Toro's vision that I would be surprised if this film does not win at least six (6) Academy Awards on Sunday March 04th, 2018, Oscar night.<br/><br/>Mrs Shullivan and I loved the film, and we were fortunate to be able to see the film with son number 2 and his set dresser girlfriend who contributed in making many of the films scenes so beautifully crafted and matched to both the musical score and the characters constant interactions that also happened to keep a full house of movie lovers in awe of your next Best Picture for 2018 winner.<br/><br/>A perfect 10 for 10 score!"
"joecoby45","6","7","10","2 February 2018"," Entertaining throughout, but also forgettable.
","The Shape of Water excels in several different departments. Its really well helmed in terms of directing and shot composition. The lighting and set designs were exquisite. The main performance by Sally Hawkins and main supporting performance by Richard Jenkins were amazing (Michael Shannon also delivers a delicious but fairly one note role as well) However the movie just feels forgettable, nothing about the story or the way its told is that great. Its hard to put in words exactly why but just from a subjective point of view the story was lacking a bit. <br/><br/>I didn't really care that much about the characters. The romance felt forced and rushed to me. The main character basically falls in love with the amphibian just after a couple of meetings with him. The character does explain to here dad at one point why she is in love with him (in an attempt to get him to help her free it) but based on the scenes we have actually seen with the two of them it didn't feel justified. <br/><br/>There are some plot holes that are forgivable but a little distracting, and also some out of character moments. But those are just nit picks. A bigger problem would be the anti climatic ending but I won't get into spoilers but lets just say it was unsatisfying. <br/><br/>Overall this is a decent film for sure, one that is overall entertaining and is never boring, but don't expect it to knock your socks off or anything (unlike the directors last fantasy film Pans Labyrinth which I truly regard as one of the greatest films ever made)."

"GODZILLA_Alpha_Predator","9","69","145","12 September 2017"," A 60's era sci-fi fairy-tale made for today's society
","Set during the 1960's space race in Baltimore, the story is a beautiful sci-fi fairy tale that explores the unexpected love between the mute cleaning lady Eliza (Sally Hawkins) and the mysterious amphibious creature (Doug Jones) trapped at the government facility she works at. When Eliza escapes with the creature thanks to the help from a gallery of colourful characters, we see the bond between woman and creature grow from mutual friends to lovers. And if that sounds like it wouldn't work on film, Guilllermo Del Torro can sell it and make it work. <br/><br/>While the story of a mute women falling in love with the Creature from the Black Lagoon sounds simple, Shape of Water is anything but which helps it to speak relevance to today's Trump-age judgmental society. Each character is so wonderfully defined and explored through arcs that relate back to Del Torro's classic narratives about the underdog, persecuted and the silenced. We root for Eliza and the creature's relationship because they both know the feeling of people not understanding who they are. With her voice literally being robbed as an infant, Eliza lives a life of silence and always listening but wants someone who truly looks past her disability. Her routinely morning masturbation tells how she how wishes to be loved both physically and emotionally. Only called ""the Asset"", the creature is an anomaly of nature that also wishes for comfort especially since he was taken away from his native home in the Amazon and forced to be a prisoner and experiment for the US government. Eliza's best friend Zelda (Octavia Spencer) lives in a strained relationship with a husband who ignores her at home. This leaves her to talk to about her marital problems to her mute friend who automatically listens. Eliza's neighbour and father-figure Giles (Richard Jenkins) is a failing advertisement artist who feels out of place in the world because of his age and homosexuality. The scientist/Russian spy Dimitri (Michael Stuhlberg) feels conflicted between his home country and the preservation of the Asset when both the Americans and Russians seek its death to each further their agenda in the Space Race. Even the villain Strickland (Michael Shannon) has his own ark. He constantly sees whether they are women, lower class, African American or non-human creatures are beneath him and wishes to be part of what he perceives to be the future of a better America but fears being left behind in the past. These characters struggle with communication in different ways from living in silence, hiding their true selves from a judgmental world, not having their ideas understood or preferring to have others be silent. <br/><br/>As expected with Del Torro, his visually stunning colour palette is ever present with each shot of the film. From the wardrobe, the look of the government facility, the vehicles to even the food, green dominates the film reflecting off cool, organic algae and water. With the cinematographer Paul D. Austerberry, he creates long panning shots that move so beautiful and organicly which leads to an amazing dance sequence that would put La La Land to shame. Vanessa Taylor whom has wrote a few episodes of Game of Thrones, has written some of the best work I have seen Del Torro direct. <br/><br/>Sally Hawkins is the true standout of this show. While not having to use dialogue (minus that one amazing dance sequence I mentioned), she relies on so much sincere and emotional expressions to really show how her character thinks and reacts. I will say it will be criminal if she doesn't get nominated for best actress next year. This being his 6th film working with Del Toro, Doug Jones as the Asset uses mime-like hand gestures to make the this character feel believable and intelligent with a human-like curiosity and soul. Just like in Hidden Figures this year, Octavia Spencer is just a breath of fresh air to watch and adds so much fun to the scenes. Richard Jenkins nearly steals the show with his dry witted and charming performance as his character Giles. While some may say Michael Shannon is getting type-cast as villains, his performance is a reminder why he is so amazing at it. <br/><br/>Guillermo Del Torro I have always loved to watch whether his films are these prestigious art pieces or just fun blockbusters. But Shape of Waters feels like new ground that he has tapped into. At the Q & A for TIFF where I saw the film, the reason for him creating this story was a response to how America's persecution of minorities had risen since the Trump's presidential campaign. This is the most relevant film Del Toro has made and is his best masterpiece since Pan's Labyrinth."

","When it comes to Del Toro, we know we are going to get a dose of weird. We will also get some fine filmmaking. The cinematography, the presentation of danger is heavy. This is another one of those cold war stories where a nautical creature is captured and kept in a tank. He has human like features. For some reason, it is decided by the evil military complex that this fellow be destroyed. The Russians fear that somehow survival of the creature puts them in danger, so they want him done in as well. Meanwhile, a young woman who is an orphan and a mute, seems to have an unexplainable attraction to this being. She manages to set up an escape and brings him to her apartment above a movie theater. There is a federal agent who is blamed for the escape. He is the real monster in the film. What transpires over the second half is very strange. There is a wait time to get our creature into friendly waters. I won't add any spoilers here. I think people who are criticizing this film, weren't listening to several key hints. I thought it was a delight. The only real criticism for me is the over the top ugly violence perpetrated by the Americans and the Russians."

"RforFilm","9","80","171","29 December 2017"," Part Cold War and part Creature from the Black Lagoon, The Shape of Water is a beautiful adult fairy tale
","Today's movie deals with a love between a human and a monster. Many should immediately shout, ""Beauty and the Beast!"", as that's the most well known fairy tale of that same kind of love. When you come down to it, it's seen as bizarre, considering that it's practically two different species that have declared a love between each other. It's a connection that falls off the radar, but you could argue we have connections to a lot of things that are not human. Children love their electronic video games. Pet owners love their dogs. What's different is that those connections are not romantic, but rather mutual. <br/><br/>Cinematically, we've gotten a lot more love stories between creatures then we realize. Shrek had an ogre in love with a human. Splash had a man in love with a mermaid. But the biggest example, oddly enough, are monster movies (more specifically, the universal monster classics). Dracula, The Mummy, and even the Phantom of the Opera pushed the boundaries of the connection that love is. The biggest example, though touched lightly, was The Creature from the Black Lagoon. Though I can't say it's a full remake, The Shape of Water seems to tell a story about a gill man who makes that connection with a human woman. <br/><br/>It's the early 1960s. Elisa (played by Sally Hawkins) is a mute woman who lives a quiet life, working as a janitor for a government research facility in Baltimore. Her two friends consist of neighbor Giles (played by Richard Jenkins), a closeted gay man who teaches her about old music and film, and coworker Zelda (played by Octavia Spencer) who is also her sign language interpreter for their employer. Her life is changed when colonel Richard Strickland (played by Michael Shannon) brings in a creature he captured in South America.<br/><br/>When Elisa comes to clean the room the ""asset"" is, she sees that it's a gill man. She starts to bring it food and even music to show that she means no harm. Slowly, the two become friends as they connect without ever speaking (considering that Eliza is mute and the gill man can't speak). Things look bleak as Strickland, obsessed with the cold war, want's the creature dissected and studied for the space race. At the same time, Soviet spies want the creature destroyed so the U.S. can't get ahead. The race is on to see if Eliza can outwit both sides of the war for her love. <br/><br/>While there does seem to be similarities to Creature from the Black Lagoon, I can assure your that The Shape of Water is not only a different film, but a pretty good one to beheld. It's strengths lie within it's story and cast. Despite being very cold war orientated, this story has a fairy tale quality to it. It's director Guillermo del Toro directed a similar project called Pan's Labyrinth, but the goals were similar; to bring tales of beauty and hope within dark times. <br/><br/>The Shape of Water is a love story first, and while I won't spoil anything, I can guarantee that I really wanted to see our two characters live together. You really feel for Eliza (who Sally Hawkins is phenomenal as playing), who is figuratively and literally a silent character waiting for her moment to present her voice. That all comes within the gill creature, whose effects are not only amazing (an example at how practical and CGI can work together), but you get a lot of personality from him. He's shy, but open to trying new things. He's a lot like a powerful child who is learning about the human world. These two do make a great couple.<br/><br/>Even the cold war elements are really good. The film smartly presents both sides as wrong...yet with people that do want to see good come out. This is also a secret I'll let the film reveal, but it makes me realize how black and white many modern movies about Soviets usually are.<br/><br/>I'll say now that The Shape of Water also happens to be a sexual story. I can see a lot of people turned off by this and simply too weird of a love story, but the movie makes it palatable enough that people should see through it's inner beauty.<br/><br/>I'll give this nine gill men out of ten. It's definitely a well written, well acted, well designed, and well directed. Fans of Guillermo del Toro, monster stories, and fantasy will like this. Will mainstream audiences get into it? It's hard to tell, but if people can love a beast from Beauty and the Beast, I don't see why they can't also love this gill man. Go see it, and find out if this story of silent beauty floats."

"fraz_bd7","10","41","82","16 January 2018"," Best of 2017: A Narrative on Love Vs Fear
","I always argue against the concept of Hate being opposite to Love. I think opposite to Love is Fear. When you love someone, you open up to the possibility of being hurt to an extent. Fear makes people uptight, closed. I think The Shape of Water is a great narrative to this Love Vs Fear concept.<br/><br/>I love Sally Hawkins. She always play very optimistic, lovable, free spirit type of characters (also watch Happy-Go-Lucky). Here she plays Elisa, who is open to new experiences, pleasure of the senses, loves people, and has a pleasure association with water - which may be synonymous to loving life. Her painter neighbor Giles is also like her, loves art and authenticity, knows to look past fear. The antagonist Richard (Michael Shannon) is the stark opposite of her, afraid of failure, losing, perceives pleasure as something bad, racist, lacks empathy, has a sort of rotten heroic theme, obsesses over objects which will make him seem bigger than other people.<br/><br/>Elisa loves this different, other worldly being. She sees the Amphibian Man as she herself is, a loving creature. Richard sees 'it' as something dangerous, something beneath him. I think there is a hint of xenophobia inherent in the plot. Another noticeable thing is that when Giles is wounded by the creature, he perceives it as an accident and heals up. Richard was unable to move past the violent incident of losing his two fingers, the wound also didn't heal. Richard is the embodiment of all the people who cannot outgrow fear. Placing Giles as the narrator of the story, the ending could move past the narrowness of reality.<br/><br/>Also loved how Dr. Hoffstetler & Zelda tried to outgrow the culture of fear. Dr. Hoffstetler tried to outgrow Cold War, the mindset of hating and fearing the other side. Zelda outgrew slave morality by doing the right thing, even if it meant committing sin or breaking the law.<br/><br/>To me it is the best movie of 2017."

","Guillermo Del Toro's newest film ""The Shape of Water"" took my breath away. Easily this is Del Toro's finest film since ""Pan's Labyrinth"" and may even be his best in general. This is a film where Del Toro weaves magic throughout with a story he created which is simple, yet layered with such interesting facets embedded in each character, set, and prop as he allows the audience to discover this intimate and fascinating world of ""broken"" people searching for a moment of meaning. Captivating from its opening scenes with haunting visual imagery, and a lyrical score by Alexandre Desplat, one is immediately enthralled by this fairy tale that is not your usual saccharine variety that Disney cranks out.<br/><br/>Del Toro knows how to tell a story with wit, style and heart. Assembling a cast headed by the incandescent Sally Hawkins in the role of Eliza who is mute throughout the film, but exudes such humanity and strength along with the villainous Michael Shannon who provides a great balance. Every single actor sparkles because every character has been developed with great care. Richard Jenkins and Octavia Spencer shine in their roles bringing a touch of quirkiness and humor to this sometimes dark story.<br/><br/>The film is achingly nostalgic with glorious production design by Paul D. Austerberry evoking the Baltimore of 1962 full of fascinating textures of faded glory, especially in the magnificent design of Eliza's apartment and hallways. Exquisite camera work by Dan Laustsen and beautifully designed costumes by Luis Sequiera contribute greatly to complete Guillermo Del Toro's vision.<br/><br/>This film is really the ultimate version of ""Beauty and The Beast"" with a touch of ""ET"", capped off with a very emotional investment, that pays off for the audience in its poetic and lyrical final scene. <br/><br/>Certainly one of the finest films of 2017."

"kjproulx","8","56","116","27 November 2017"," A Beautifully Shot Film
","Being praised around the world as one of the best films of the year from people visiting festivals, The Shape of Water is Guillermo Del Toro's latest venture into the strange and moving area of film. From Pan's Labyrinth to recent films like Pacific Rim, I've always enjoyed watching his films. While I won't be praising this film as much as some people have been, it will easily be receiving a recommendation from my end, but to the right crowd. The Shape of Water is a beautiful, yet strange tale of romance, and even though you've seen this particular story many times over, I feel as though there is enough of a fresh spin to win fans over. Here are my thoughts on The Shape of Water.<br/><br/>To get this out of the way, people will surely be going into this film and receiving flashbacks from films like Beauty and the Beast, Splash, or even Shrek. Taking place in a fantasy world where men capture exotic creatures and use them to experiment on, Eliza discovers the creature after being tortured. Forming a very close bond with him, forming a plan to help him escape, and having him stay in her bathtub where he can have room to breathe, this very quickly becomes a very strange romantic tale that people will either buy into or find themselves wondering why they're watching this movie in the first place.<br/><br/>Throughout the course of the film, certain characters will present themselves in order to provide fear to the creature or to make you side with him, so that the story may progress. There are definitely a few forced aspects about this film, but when everything is filmed and presented so wonderfully, it's hard to let that clash with your enjoyment of the movie as a whole. To add to that, it was clear that certain scenes or lines of dialogue were added to the film in order to give it a sense of realism, but some of the vulgarity actually took me out of the overall experience, due to the fact that it wanted to get you emotionally invested at the same time. You'll know what I mean if you choose to check out this film.<br/><br/>Aside from appearances in Paddington or Blue Jasmine, I'd never really thought about Sally Hawkins as a leading lady of a major production, but sometimes you're proved to be severely wrong because her performance here floored me. I was incredibly invested in every single moment her character was on-screen and anything I didn't like about this movie faded away every time she interacted with someone and had to display her emotions through her sign language or by just simply tearing up or showing emotion through her eyes. I will be remembering this performance as one of the best of the year by year.<br/><br/>In the end, where I think this film slightly fails is in its addition of human villains. The Shape of Water is a beautiful romance at its core, but I didn't feel the movie shows quite enough of it to really be a masterpiece, even though the production designers sure made it feel like a damn elegant piece of cinema. If for nothing else, the set design, along with the visual effects and art direction, will surely be included in the awards season to come, because it's some of the best I've seen all year (possibly even the absolute best). <br/><br/>Overall, I can call The Shape of Water a damn solid film, but it's not quite as wonderful as I was hoping it would be. To fans of strange or unique films, I recommend you check out this movie. Many people seem to be adoring this film, and while I agree that it's impressive, it's just hard not to compare it to many similar concepts. A great, yet familiar experience."

","I have loved Guillermo del Toro since his amazing ""Pan's Labyrinth"" and his newest piece of art hasn't let me down at all. The Shape of Water is a tale of a woman who's mute, and feels like she doesn't belong anywhere. All she sees in herself is her ""disability"" and that all changes when she meets a ""creature"" who has been captured and treated like a prisoner. She befriends creature and a tender love begins to form between them, and she decides to save and remove the creature before he's dissected by the government. The movie deals with acceptance and tolerance throughout the film, from Elisa herself to her gay neighbour played by the acclaimed Richard Jenkins.

","""The Shape of Water"" (2017 release; 123 min.) brings the story of Elisa. As the movie opens, we see Elisa getting ready for work. She and her friend Zelda work as janitors at a restricted government research facility. Along the way, we learn that Elisa is mute. Then one day, a new ""asset "" is delivered to the research facility. Mysterious at first, we learn quickly that it is some sort of amphibious creature. Elisa is immediately drawn to it. But the guy running the research project, a no-good scientist named Colonel Strickland, and his boss General Hoyt, have other ideas... What will happen to the creature? At this point we're 10 min. into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.<br/><br/>Couple of comments: this is the latest fantasy story, if not fairy tale, from Mexican writer-director Guillermo del Toro (""Pan's Labyrinth""). Here he brings us a story that in its essence is a variation of ""Beauty and the Beast"", or even ""Creature from the Black Lagoon"" and the original (1932 and 1976) ""King Kong"". The movie is set in the late 50s or early 60s (at one point, on of the kids asks if he can watch Bonanza), and in fact the overall feeling of the movie is as it it was made in that era, rather than today. The Location of Elisa's apartment, above the Orpheum movie theater where ""The Story of Ruth"" and ""Mardi Grass"" are playing, only increases that overall late 50s/early 60s feel. The set productions is first rate all the way. The way del Toro directs the movie reminded me more than once of Steven Spielberg. Sally Hawkins is outstanding as Elisa. That makes two noteworthy movies this year for her: earlier this year she was equally stellar in ""Maudie"", but watch her pile up the nominations for this film come the awards season (she already picked up a Golden Globe nomination). Last but certainly not least, there is a wonderful orchestral score composed by Oscar-winner Alexandre Desplat, and I'm going on record that he will score another Best Movie Score Oscar nomination for this.<br/><br/>""The Shape of Water"" opened up this weekend at my local art-house theater on not one but two screens, a rarity. The Sunday early evening screening where I saw this at was attended very nicely, I'm happy to report. Given the overall quality of the movie and the nice counter-programming to the inevitable blockbuster that is ""The Last Jedi"", I can see this having long legs at the art-house theater circuit. Every day Elisa picks up a ""thought of the day"" from her wall calendar, and on a certain day the thought is ""Life is but the shipwreck of our plans"", and that certainly also seems to be the case for this movie, but in the best possible way. ""The Shape of Water"" is a WINNER."

Chained and tortured, this creature searches for the tiniest bit of compassion and finally finds it in a lowly worker named Elisa, a lonely mute waif who also yearns for that human touch...or the next best thing.<br/><br/>The director carefully sidesteps the sexuality and walks that fine line masterfully, avoiding any unintentional uneasiness with its sensitive subject matter. He fabricates a totally believable world of romance and longing. Adding to the overall romanticism is an insightful and poignant screenplay by Mr. del Toro and Vanessa Taylor that takes its rather rudimental storylines of espionage and governmental conspiracies and wisely pushes those plot devices aside to concentrate on the relationship of two misfits who happen to fall in love. The dialog and voiceover narration is quite beautiful and touching. Also noticeable is the subtleties of racial tension and homophobia in the plot. Yes, there is much at play in this film.<br/><br/>The Shape of Water works its magic with its strong visual images, lensed by Dan Lausten, and a lush romantic score by Alexandre Desplat. The production design by Paul D. Austerberry is exquisite. The muted colors, all teals and rustics, cast a melancholy aura to the story which most effectively transports the moviegoer into a otherworldly universe. ""The world is a lonely place "" it seems to say, and its characters reinforce that sense of desperation and sadness.<br/><br/>The entire ensemble is splendid. Sally Hawkins is an appealing presence as Elisa. The actress relies on her facial expressions and graceful movement to convey the character's isolation and angst. She glows with a radiance that embellishes Elisa's pain. Doug Jones is her love interest and he literally provides such fluid movement and elegance to the role. (Kudos to the creature design, an elongated mass of aqua scales and gills forming rippling musculature that enhances the attraction factor. Let's face reality, the surreal story is far-fetched and if the beast were a gelatin mass of ooze or a furry fanged monster, the love story could have been a tad unpleasant and possibly intolerable.) Yet, we too fall under the filmmaker's charming spell.<br/><br/>Michael Shannon plays the real monster in the film, a villain with no redeeming traits. He provides the necessary hostilities and is a compelling force that advances the narrative, although one wishes the character was written in less black and white terms. Michael Stuhlbarg is Dr. Robert Hoffstetler, an impassioned scientist who sees positive communication with this alien as a breakthrough for mankind and shows the many sides of a conflicted man wanting to do right. As Elisa's friends, Octavia Spencer and Richard Jenkins are simply wonderful. Also memorable is Nick Searcy as the military-minded General Hoyt.<br/><br/>As this fractured fairy tale gently unfolds its love story about ""a princess without voice"" and a giant amphibian as her ""frog prince"", it all sounds absurd. And it is. But The Shape of Water exists and works its magic so completely that one longs for it to be real. One of the year's best.<br/><br/>ANY COMMENTS: Please contact me at: jadepietro@rcn.com"
"TigerHeron","8","18","32","17 December 2017"," The Amazon's freshwater but whatever
","This is an entertaining, even charming fairy tale, if you can suspend not only disbelief but also knowledge and critical faculties. <br/><br/>The story appears to have been inspired by ""Creature from the Black Lagoon"" although it is a fantasy/romance rather than a horror movie. It has many similarities to Del Toro's ""Pan's Labyrinth,"" so if you liked that movie, you will probably like this one. Like ""Pan's Labyrinth"" it has a horrific torture scene, but unlike that film also has graphic sex. This is not a movie for persons under 14. <br/><br/>The main theme of this film is the outcast. Set in the early 1960s, it ties together the lives of a variety of social outcasts including the amphibian monster. Del Toro and his crew do a good job creating the setting and mood. The acting and the costumes are stellar. Then why can't they get some basic geographical and historical details right? A creature from the Amazon lives in freshwater, not saltwater. The Soviets recruited Americans to be moles; they didn't somehow graft a Russian into America and have him pass as ""Bob."" The Bob/Dimitri character was beyond ludicrous (although if he had been presented realistically as an American or as a Soviet double agent his character would have been realistic and more compelling. It's sad because I liked the character). Again Hollywood insults our intelligence. But despite all I enjoyed this film, seeing it as a simple fairy tale on a child's level despite the sex and violence. If you like fairy tales (and I do) you will enjoy it."

","I normally do not write a movie review but after watching this movie it almost got me into rage that I have to say something. Don't pay to watch this shit, it's not worth it, and not worth all the attention. Oscar Best Picture? Excuse me, I can pick any random movie in 2017 and it would be more inspiring than watching an odd woman making out with a fish. Oh, what else was in it?<br/><br/>I thought we must think what message this movie is trying to convey to audience when we watch one. Even if it's a comedy, a chick flick, at least they are trying to bring some harmless fun. What does this movie trying to say though? If you are a mute woman you should maybe give up human connection but intercourse with a fish? Beautifying zoophilia and everyone should consider doing it? Go steal a fish because you are in love with him or it?<br/><br/>I've heard some people compare this to Beauty and the Beast. But no, the Beast was originally a kind human and turned back into a human when he found true love. It was to educate kids how we should love someone because of their good hearts but not good looks. And this, this monster or whatever it is - is purely a fish from the Amazon rainforest. <br/><br/>It's incredibly sick to see how the woman has decided to undress herself and jump into the bath tub and had sex with the fish, then told her best friend at work how big his penis is. <br/><br/>This is a disgusting movie."

Although the whole story doesn't add anything new to the genre, and it's a little too plain to be honest, all the characters manage to keep you interested in their development and overall look.

"ferguson-6","8","25","47","7 December 2017"," beautiful film, creature, performances
","Greetings again from the darkness. Recent release THE JUSTICE LEAGUE is filled with superheroes, but filmmaker-extraordinaire Guillermo del Toro finds his league of misfits and outcasts to be much more interesting - as do I. The numerous possible descriptions of this movie are all accurate, yet alone, each falls short: a fairy tale, fable, monster movie, unconventional romance, sci-fi, cold war saga, and commentary on societal misfits. What is also true is that it's a gorgeous film with terrific performances, and it pays lovely tribute to the classics. <br/><br/>A government research facility in 1962 Baltimore is the setting, and ""The Asset"" being secured and studied is an amphibious creature that was captured in South America by a sadistic Richard Strickland (Michael Shannon) and his electric cattle prod. Now the military, and a 5- star General played by Nick Searcy, is in charge. The lead scientist played by Michael Stuhlbarg certainly has a different agenda than the military, whose focus seems to be more on preventing the Russians (closer than you think) from stealing the asset than in actually seizing the rare scientific opportunity for advancement.<br/><br/>While all the ominous and clandestine government operations are being conducted, a member of the nighttime cleaning crew - a mute woman named Elisa (Sally Hawkins) – makes a very personal connection with the creature through nutritious snacks, Big Band music and sign language. This is the enchanting portion of the story and is admittedly (by del Toro) inspired by the 1954 classic CREATURE FROM THE BLACK LAGOON (a personal favorite of mine). Elisa and the creature experience a romantic courtship not unlike what we have seen in many other love stories  that is, if you overlook the amphibious being that makes up half of this couple. In fact, ""going with"" the story is crucial to one's enjoyment. Sit back and let the magic and wonder and fantastical nature of del Toro's imagination sweep you away – just as it has done for Elisa.<br/><br/>There are many elements of the film worth exploring, and it's likely to take another viewing to capture many of them. The band of misfits is comprised of the creature (Doug Jones), Elisa (Ms. Hawkins), Elisa's wise and wise-cracking co-worker Zelda (Octavia Spencer), and Elisa's neighbor Giles (Richard Jenkins), a closeted gay graphics design artist. These are the nice folks/beings who make up the world that seems to be run by bullies and predators (sound familiar?). There is even a religious debate here as it's mentioned that the creature was treated by a God in his natural environment, and a brief discussion is had over what might a God look like. All of the actors are superb, and Miss Hawkins delivers her second knockout performance of the year (the other being MAUDIE).<br/><br/>""The future"" is a central theme of the story, though Elisa is most focused on now – how to find some happiness in a world that has been so challenging. Elisa realizes she and the creature are more similar than not, and she feels his pain each time the power-hungry Strickland (Shannon) pops him with the electric cattle prod. There is an ethereal beauty (and yes, sensuality) to the scenes with Elisa and the creature, and it even leads to a terrific song (""You'll Never Know"" by Renee Fleming) and dance dream sequence. In addition, you'll notice many nods and tributes to classics such as Mr. Ed, Dobie Gillis, Betty Grable, Bill ""Bojangles"" Robinson and Shirley Temple, and Carmen Miranda singing ""Chica Chica Boom Chic"". It's also no accident that the apartments of Elisa and Giles are located directly above a palatial old movie theatre that is struggling to make ends meet. All of these pieces are tied together as Mr. del Toro honors the art forms he so adores.<br/><br/>For those who enjoy such detail, it should be noted that the color green plays a huge role throughout the film  the water, the creature, the uniforms, the furniture, the walls – even the Jello, the pie and Strickland's (teal) Cadillac. The use of color ties in the ever- present mythology, and the theme of meanness and power versus kindness and love.<br/><br/>Cinematographer Dan Laustsen adds to the magical feel with his camera work and lighting that perfectly complements the characters and tone. Oscar winning composer Alexandre Desplat delivers yet another spot on score that not only syncs with story, but also the numerous classic songs included. Guillermo det Toro is one of the most creative and inventive contemporary filmmakers, and though this one may fall a tick below his masterpiece PAN'S LABRYNTH, it is sure to dazzle and mesmerize those who give it a chance  and let's hope there are many who do!"
"florianwedekink-22987","2","35","69","25 March 2018"," What is wrong with the Oscars?
","This movie has all it takes to be successful in the world of the oscars: An disabled person, a woman as the main character, a homosexual, an overpictured villian, sex, and a grand finale with completly non-logical decisions to drive the plot.
Spoileralert!
I started this movie with some expectations and was really looking forward. Lets begin with the positiv things:
-great music
-funny ""dialogues"" between Elisa and Delilah
-well done cgi and costumes
Cons:
Where to start? So many things about this movie seem to unease me and I wanna just point out some facts. First, it not make sense, that a cleaning staff member has non-restricted access to all rooms within a super secret research facility. Expecially not to the room where a creature is held that excists only once on the whole planet. 
Why is the villan so super evil? Why would he like to hit and torture this creature? That does not make sense in the first place. And why on earth is this creature shaped like a human? Narzism of the director? Are we humans so perfect that the only possible shape which came to their mind was humanoid? The human anatomy evolved to be superior on the ground but not a single marine creature has those features. So why does it have feet? To make the sex with the protagonist less creepy? Lets take human anatomy and add some fins and voila.
I was done when the creature kissed the dying protagonist in the end (which by the way resulted in her growing fins and gins subsequetly healing her wounds). Kissing is based on human culture and nothing you just come up with being a marine creature when you float in the water next to a dying person. Anyway, there are so many perfectly fitting reviews regarding the nonsense displayed in this movie also referring to the fact that this movie was kind of a remake of other movies. I wanted to let out trouble because nobody will be able to give me back the 2 hours of life I lost....and the veins that ruptured when I heard how many prices this movie won."
"mbackes1968","3","35","69","15 March 2018"," This is the best picture that the academy can come up with?
","I watch over 250 movies a year. I rate them all. I have a very detailed rating system and when I watched the trailer I was intrigued. I think Michael Shannon is a great actor and the rest of the cast seemed good too. Unfortunately I sat through a creature from the black lagoon movie from the 50's with a horrible 2 bit costume. I cannot believe how outrageous and over the top the silliness of this movie is. This is what the academy thinks is best picture? I read the reviews on this site and a lot of reviews are people giving this movie top scores because the director or some interpretation that not everyone gets or cares to get. If have to watch a movie to spin it a certain way for others, then it is an unwatchable movie. Any movie that wins best picture in mind should appeal to all demographics. The young and old should walk out of the theater, look at each other and say ""wow that was great"". If you walk out the theater and some people say ""yeah that was great because it represents..."", and the other half walk out feeling they were just robbed out of $12 bucks, then it should not win best picture. Yet another travesty for the academy. Too bad the general public does not give out the oscar. If we did, then this movie would not even nominated for anything but a over the top cheesy B movie. Extremely disappointed...AGAIN. Thanks academy for another joke you delivered on Oscar night."

","This review contains spoilers.<br/><br/>The Shape of Water is directed by Guillermo del Toro and stars Sally Hawkins. Sally Hawkins plays a lonely mute woman that encounters a captured aquatic being at work. Meanwhile a Russian spy discovers the creature and wants to preserve its life.<br/><br/>The Shape of Water has classic themes from Guillermo del Toro's other works. He likes to present fantastical beasts in a realistic setting. Typically the villain is someone that wants to exploit either the creature or the main character in the story. The main character discovers something magical and seeks out adventure. With these tropes in mind, one can see how similar The Shape of Water is with Pan's Labyrinth. The main character's motivations for helping the aquatic being is altruistic. The movie takes place in the United States, with the villain being a military commander that wants to research the alien creature.<br/><br/>The cast does a great job in this movie. Sally Hawkins is the stand-out cast member. She portrays the mute woman well by acting with sign language and body language. Without words, she could portray her character's emotions to the audience well. She also garners the audience's empathy by allowing them to understand her character's plight.<br/><br/>The directing and editing give the movie a fast pace. The scenes are all aesthetically pleasing. The pace of the movie is intense without being too fast. Every scene is thoughtfully planned beforehand. The CGI is used appropriately in this movie with no scenes being too jarring.<br/><br/>The only criticism I have of the movie is perhaps the one-dimensional villain. There was nothing redeeming about him, and he existed for only one purpose. His only motivation for his deeds appeared to only be greed. He also sexually harasses the main character for seemingly no reason other than to establish his own villainy.<br/><br/>I recommend The Shape of Water. The movie is a magical adventure that explores the nature of connection between individuals.<br/><br/>Grade: B"
"agmoldham","7","17","30","4 March 2018"," Great Entertainment
","You can't help but feel that The Shape of Water uses a lot of other films for influences. Although it's understandable that some may find it a little too sweet I really enjoyed the movie.<br/><br/>This is Guillermo del Toro at his Pan's Labyrinth best. The film is scattered with several breathtaking scenes. At the start of these scenes you breath in and know that you are about to be wowed for the next few minutes. I've always been a big fan of Michael Shannon and never have his talents been better showcased than the role of Richard Strickland. Sally Hawkins is also excellent in the lead role of Elisa who is a isolated mute cleaner working at a secret government agency. <br/><br/>Not for the action junkies, but everyone else should give it a viewing."
"hswater","9","17","30","14 January 2018"," a beautiful sick movies
","Del Toro did it again, using beautiful unreal scenes to depict the cruelty of the reality. The color and the structure of the picture are so joyful, and then some scenes make you not too comfortable. Isn't it good? About the story line, it is just complex enough to make this movie excellent."
"aaronlbacks","7","17","30","4 January 2018"," I fell in love with an amorphous amphibian creature
","This was the first film by del Toro that I have seen, and I believe that he has made a very good impression on me. He has crafted here a tale of magical realism, with a wondrous amphibian-like creature (Doug Jones) who falls in love with a mute human girl, Elisa (Sally Hawkins). In many ways, it really feels kind of like a fairy tale, with a narrator (who is introduced at the beginning and disappears and comes back at the end - it felt kind of slapped on however), a mystical and godly creature and its lover, and the evil antagonist, Dick Strickland (Michael Shannon), rife with selfishness and hatred. Each of the characters are intricately written and detailed, and are each characterized in a unique and interesting way, very unlike most anything I have ever seen, but done so well and obviously it makes me wonder why it hasn't been done that way before. And to fill these characters are actors that give some of the best performances of the year, especially Hawkins and Shannon. Hawkins doesn't speak a single word throughout this film and conveys every bit of dialogue she needs through her face alone, aided by her signing which was so fluid it seemed like she learned American Sign Language in its entirety in order to play this part. Shannon does so well playing the villain that I would have been satisfied if it ended with him winning. These are some characters that you can really get behind and root for, no matter what side they're on. The creature was beautiful. I couldn't tell if it was done practically or with CGI and I think that attests to how well it was produced. And to sum it up, the dialogue and story were held with care and each felt finely crafted. Oh, and I want to praise the film for being ballsy as well, there was a full nudity masturbation scene in the first five minutes that totally caught me by surprise.
But, I don't feel that everything about this story was so finely told - mainly the attempt to humanize the creature. He eats eggs like us, he listens to music like us, and he has sex like us? What? They don't exactly bridge this conclusion all that well and it's never really explained why Elisa is attracted to the creature in the first place, aside from the fact she might relate to it emotionally. This kind of makes the love aspect of the story feel a little shotty. I could understand wanting to protect and care for this beast, but Frenching it? Idk del Toro. It felt like some sort of furry/bestiality porn to me, and everything up to this point was some really elaborate foreplay. Maybe it wasn't that intense, but I still got that feeling at points. Also, the pacing felt kind of weird between the climax halfway through the film and the climax at the end. Everything slows down super quickly and it feels like it's The Shape of Molasses. But the ending I will admit does kind of make up for that. It's safe to say that this is one of the best of the year and I am sure that it'll be nominated for some Oscars in at least some regard."

"ardaergin96","1","39","78","5 March 2018"," Disappointing Movie
","Obviously, Guillermo Del Toro watched lots of Jean-Pierre Jeunet movies before he shot this movie. Unfortunately this movie doesn't offer anything new and original to you. Basically the movie says ""don't be prejudiced"" and ""there is no boundry for love"". But this kind of messages have already been given in a lot of other movies and this movie doesn't add anything new to the old ones. The characters are not well-build and so simple as if they're in the child movie or cartoon. For example, there is a villain character who likes to torment the creature and you can't even understand why he is like that. Also the bathroom scene is stolen from the movie ""delicatessen"". Academy gave 4 oscars to this movie and it's really disappointing. It didn't even deserve one of them. I hope Del Toro doesn't continue to steal another director's ideas and win prizes with them."

","Guillermo del Toro's wonderful fable – ""my favourite thing I've ever done"" – is kind of like Arrival starring Amélie, as a shy, mute cleaner (Sally Hawkins) at a government base begins to communicate with the aquaman in the tank, and feels the first flickerings of love.<br/><br/>Set – like my last film at the LFF, On Chesil Beach – in 1962, it's really about today: a plea for tolerance in the light of Trump and co's war on Muslims, blacks and gays, and a monster movie in which the monster isn't the Other, it's right-wing, gung-ho America, represented here by Michael Shannon, as a psychotic vet in a teal Cadillac who'll beat the living crap out of anything that doesn't conform to his very specific notion of a person. The toxic machismo and vicious hatred of otherness isn't restricted to him, though, it's endemic: and hiding behind the most benign of fronts.<br/><br/>Shot in a rich, stylised palette of greens and browns (admittedly more City of Lost Children), set partly above an old, working cinema and filled with little visual effects – though with a creature who's delightfully and resolutely real – it reminded me of nothing as much as Amélie. That 2001 movie might be the last time I felt quite so charmed by a lead character as by Hawkins' Eliza Esposito, whose increasingly appealing, steely, sexy performance recalls that holy trinity of great mute turns: Dorothy McGuire in The Spiral Staircase, Samantha Morton in Sweet and Lowdown and Jane Wyman in Johnny Belinda, and is just as full of nobility and pathos; just as lacking in gimmickry.<br/><br/>There's nice work too from Richard Jenkins, who is frequently held hostage in underwhelming comedies, but showed in Tom McCarthy's 2007 masterpiece, The Visitor that he's just about the best actor in America when he can be bothered. As Eliza's gay flatmate, a struggling, alcoholic advertising artist, he's never self-pitying or trite, and those traits no more define who he is than the fact he's bald.<br/><br/>The plot is fine: diverting, involving and well-balanced between moments of intrigue, suspense and humour, but it's the passages of poetry that completely bewitched me, including one sequence in a waterlogged bathroom that took the breath away.<br/><br/>There's another beguiling flight of fancy that memorably references Fred and Ginger's 'Let's Face the Music and Dance', and music is critical to this film: Hawkins and Jenkins engage in an impromptu tap, Alexandre Desplat equips her with the most enchanting theme, and del Toro exhibits his great love for – and understanding of – classic Hollywood by including several clips from old Fox musicals, including Bojangles and Shirley Temple in The Little Colonel and colour clips of Alice Faye and Carmen Miranda rendered in the monochrome of '60s tube TV. Realising that I was in a cinema in which a modern audience was being forced to watch old footage of Alice Faye, and listen to a short monologue discoursing on her ill- fated Hollywood career was just the most delightful thing.<br/><br/>So a sci-fi, a horror, a monster movie, a romance, a Cold War thriller, and a history lesson about Alice Faye: this genre-bender is many things, but above all it's an emotional experience, a clear- sighted, glowing-hearted picture with some of the most beautiful imagery and a performance I'm going to be rhapsodising about for weeks, months, years."

Guillermo Del Toro, my friends, is the mind behind it. He has already stood out for other films like Pan's Labyrinth and Crimson Peak, but this one managed to put a title that will never be taken from him: Best director of 2017. Nothing more than deserved did an incredible job, as in all his films.

","... but this is a make-believe fairy tale, and thus expects the audience to accept the simplicity of ""and they fell in love, and lived happily forever after"". It's not supposed to go into the deep intricacies and nuances of their relationship--she loves him, he loves her, that's it. I think that story-telling, especially fairy tales, ask us to just accept ""love at first sight"" as being a thing, so you have to watch the film from that perspective--the first time Eliza sees The Asset in containment, she's fallen in love. It's worth noting that all the lives of the characters outside of Eliza and The Asset are not fairy tales--Giles doesn't get the guy, and he doesn't redeem himself at work. Zelda spends much of her time complaining about the dysfunctional marriage she's in, and Mr. Strickland is the most obvious contrast: he's living the literal embodiment of the American Dream, and it tears him apart, makes him evil and sick inside. Then there is Bob, who's trying his best to live out his life as a spy thriller despite being caught, literally, with his pants down. The movie asks you to root for Eliza and The Asset because among all these failed fairy tales they've found theirs, and you want to root for their happily ever after.<br/><br/>It's worth noting that the film comments on their relationship being difficult to understand: Octavia Spencer's character, Zelda, tells her husband that he wouldn't understand the two of them, not if he tried his whole life.<br/><br/>There is one final twist to all of this that just makes the film complete, and even makes the fairy tale make sense . If you have just seen trailers you need to see it to the end."

"evanston_dad","8","100","220","31 December 2017"," Fairy Tale for Adults
","With ""The Shape of Water,"" Guillermo del Toro has crafted a wondrous fairy tale for adults. Many are saying it's not as good as ""Pan's Labyrinth,"" but I didn't much care for that movie and liked this one much more. It's anchored by a marvelous and silent performance by Sally Hawkins, as a mute cleaning lady in a government installation during the Cold War who falls in love and tries to rescue a strange, amphibious being who is wanted by both the American and Russian governments. She's aided in her efforts by gay next door neighbor Richard Jenkins and work partner Octavia Spencer. It's notable that the three principal characters are people pushed to the fringes of society because of various things ""wrong"" with them from the perspective of 1960s America: being handicapped, being gay, being black. That a rag tag group of disenfranchised misfits dare to go up against the government and military establishment of a world superpower gives the film both a tremendous rooting interest and mirrors what's happening right now in American culture, in which groups who previously had no voice in the cultural conversation are now being heard loud and clear.<br/><br/>The one thing I did not like about this movie is what it chooses to do with its villain, played by...who else?...Michael Shannon. I guess he's meant to represent the white establishment, but del Toro and Shannon take the character too far, turning him into a nightmarish psycho, when really the story would have been more interesting if the villain had remained more of a faceless institution rather than one single crazy dude with a score to settle. del Toro also can't resist the urge to peddle in gratuitous and graphic violence, most of it connected to Shannon's character, and which doesn't really serve any purpose other than to pull the audience out of the movie. The film doesn't need it and would have been better without it.<br/><br/>Still, even with its flaws, ""The Shape of Water"" is a visually absorbing and evocative beauty and the beast tale with one foot planted in old Hollywood and the other in our current unsettled times.<br/><br/>Grade: A"
"ninjachewit","8","15","26","24 April 2018"," A good movie with somewhat of a predictable plot but full of emotional energy
","Del Toro's ""The Shape of Water"" is a movie that makes you feel really tense and emotional at the theatres, but restraints you to a degree with the linearity or familiarity of the plot structure. The villain is not really that scary or intimidating- the part where he snaps off his rotting finger is pretty much the only thing original about him- other than that he's a derivative of the typical bad, corrupt FBI agent who only listens to his mission/code similar to Anton Chigurgh in ""No Country for Old Men"".<br/><br/>The reason i'm giving this movie an 8 is because although the characters and themes are very familiar and you don't come out of this movie with a fresh viewpoint on the world, it was well-written and some of the dialogue was very emotionally invoking. Especially the part where the old man is talking with the girl."
"ShadeKnight","2","33","65","3 May 2018"," Overvalued. Visually engaging, bereft of anything enjoyable.
","SPOILER: So, the visual appeal of the film is unquestionable.<br/><br/>***Spoiler alert***<br/><br/>First, the film packs a ridiculous number of issues into the work that the writer/director treats as fundamental to the plot, using annoying characters that serve no purpose except to highlight themes: homophobia, racism, misogyny, perversion, classism, nationalism, anti-authoritarianism, Cold War fear, respect for the impaired, etc.<br/><br/>Next, the sheer repulsiveness of various devices in the film (the fingers, the beheaded cat) are again, there just to be there. They symbolize nothing and as plot devices, do little except to make viewers say ""Ew"". Sure, the cat leads to a wound that is then healed to show the miraculous power of the creature, but what for? To show it can't die at the end? That's it? Nothing explored there, and that seems to be the rest of the film in a nutshell. What is explored probably shouldn't have been and what isn't seems far more tantalizing than the story that's told.<br/><br/>The big thing however, is that the heroine, trying to save the life of a creature, falls in lust with it - NOT love. When we finally see her gills and realize she belongs to the aquatic world (which is patently obvious from the moment we see the marks on her neck), we're supposed to believe she belongs with this creature. Yet, nothing in the film gives the creature any intellect or heart, or evokes even a modicum of pathos for a SENTIENT being. Perhaps for a puppy, sure. Basically, she's engaging in bestiality, she may as well have had sex with a carp. There is no difference, yet we're supposed to believe that she shares a special kinship with the thing because it can play fetch and they both come from the sea. I come from the land and though I've seen quite a few attractive sheep, I've never actually crossed that line.<br/><br/>Boring, confused in its goals, and generally painful to watch, it not only failed to suck me into its world, it made me want to leave it and never return."

","...seen such a steaming pile of garbage as this film. There are bad movies that you still enjoy watching, but this... this is a special kind of atrocious. 
1) I do not understand who this movie is made for. The ""feelings"" of the characters are so damn simplistic that the characters from Notebook would be jealous. Characters are either horrendous murderous monsters, or the most wonderful people to ever exist. This kind of simplicity reminds me of children's movies, because children don't understand complex emotions and feelings, but there are extremely explicit sexual and violent scenes, so this is clearly targeted at adults... adults with a very primitive understanding of human relationships and, well, actually the ""love"" itself. 
2) It would be an understatement to say that every single character is one-dimensional. Main character is numb and super kind, and that's all we know about her, apart from the fact that she has a perpetual ""deer in the headlights"" look to her and acts as a person with the mild Down syndrome.
Neighbor is gay and that's all we know.
Main character's friend is a sassy black lady and that's about it.
And main villain is just that - the worst person to ever walk the face of Earth. He is racist, sexist, abusive, likes to torture people.
3) Not sure how to put it, but the film is just stupid. The entire premise is something out of a Disney cartoon for a 5 year old.
4) It is so shallow. So, so shallow. If you find this movie ""deep"" or ""beautifully emotional' as some reviewers say, you clearly have a mental maturity of a 3 year old. No, this is not how love works. No, you don't fall in love with a man (or a fish) because he ate eggs with you, listened to music with you, and was being cute - this is how you bond with a pet.

"zardoz-13","8","23","43","31 December 2017"," A Creature Feature Romance
","Imagine the Universal Pictures' horror classic ""Creature from the Black Lagoon"" (1954) revamped as a romantic escapade, and you'll have some idea what to expect from ""Hellboy"" helmer Guillermo del Toro's supernatural saga ""The Shape of Water,"" starring Sally Hawkins, Octavia Spencer, Richard Jenkins, and Michael Shannon. Doug Jones plays an enigmatic humanoid amphibian from the Amazon who walks upright on two legs. Equipped with gills and face like C3p0, he lands in the hands of the U.S. Government. ""The Shape of Water"" takes place in 1961 during the early years of the Space Race between Uncle Sam and the Soviet Union. Unlike the reptilian ""Black Lagoon Creature,"" this gill guy wouldn't frighten a fly, though he does use his large, webbed hands with claws to tear a couple of fingers off his sadistic human curator. Later, he munches on the head of a contentious cat. Scrambling to launch a man into space, the U.S. Government believes this creature will provide them with answers to questions about human survival in space. Basically, this fable concerns an oversized lab specimen and the heartless abuse that his captors inflict on him with Nazi-like relish for their research. Mind you, Hollywood has made movies comparable to ""The Shape of Water,"" such as ""Splice"" (2009), about a lab specimen that unscrupulous researchers concocted from a genetic crucible and then learned they couldn't control it. The humanoid amphibian here isn't as treacherous as the feminine hybrid in ""Splice"" or the ""Species"" (1995) franchise. <br/><br/>Indeed, ""The Shape of Water"" creature is altogether sympathetic, and del Toro's relies on imagery designed to win our sympathy-particularly when it is chained up in a way reminiscent of the ""Frankenstein"" monster. A huge metal shackle surrounds its neck while a spider-web of chain links hold it down to a huge circular pad. Nevertheless, despite a few scenes where the villain gouges it with an electric cattle prod, ""The Shape of Water"" focuses on a mute cleaning lady at the top-secret complex who falls in love with it and yearns to free it. When it doesn't remind you of ""Creature from the Black Lagoon,"" del Toro's winsome yarn evokes memories of ""Beauty and the Beast."" Mind you, occasionally things happen that may confound audiences, but ""The Shape of Water"" is ostensibly a love story that indulges in surrealism without rubbing your face in its less savory moments. No, it isn't surprising that del Toro co-wrote and directed this fanciful epic. After all, he was responsible for ""Hellboy"" (2004) and ""Hellboy: The Golden Army."" 
 
Korean War veteran Richard Strickland (Michael Shannon of ""Man of Steel"") has captured an anonymous amphibian during a South American safari, and General Hoyt (Nick Searcy of ""The Fugitive"") wants a team of scientists to slice it up to see if they can duplicate its ability to live in different environments. Strickland serves as a sadistic jailor who terrorizes the amphibian with an electric cattle prod. He enjoys wreaking pain on it, especially after it rips off two of his fingers. This amphibian is imprisoned at a top-secret government research facility where Elisa Esposito (British actress Sally Hawkins of ""Blue Jasmine"") works as a cleaning lady. Elisa's best friend, Zelda Fuller (Octavia Spencer of ""The Help""), does her talking for her, because Elisa is mute and can only communicate with sign language. Elisa feels sad about the way the creature is mistreated. She displays compassion for it, feeding it hard-boiled eggs and playing music for it on her portable record player. The amphibian reciprocates her kindness. Moreover, the creature seems to fathom sign language, and the two become friends. Eventually, the scientists realize the only way to exact the secrets of the gill man's mysterious corporeal being is to perform an autopsy on it. Predictably, Elisa cannot let this unspeakable act transpire so she exploits her knowledge of the security measures, and plots an escape plan. She finds an unlikely ally in the form of another scientist, Dr. Robert Hoffstetler (Michael Stuhlbarg of ""Doctor Strange""), who argues killing the amphibian is the worst thing that they can do for their research. While he is sympathetic to the plight of the creature, Hoffstetler has his own subversive reasons for not destroying it. Meantime, Zelda has no idea that Elisa has become so inextricably enamored of the creature. Initially, Elisa doesn't want to involve Zelda in the escape. Instead, she enlists her next-door neighbor, a lonely artist, Giles (Richard Jenkins of ""Me, Myself & Irene""), to help her undertake this spine-tingling caper. Hoffstetler throws in with them and furnishes a vital distraction guaranteed to make the escape a surefire success. 
 
Guillermo del Toro orchestrates several white-knuckled sequences during the breakout that will put you on the edge of your seat. However, it isn't so much the way he stages ""The Shape of Water"" that makes it memorable, but the gallery of characters that he spends a little more than two hours creating until we either love them or hate them. Elisa lives in her own fantasy world above a movie theater, and she has a dull, drab existence until she encounters this strange amphibian and tenders her love to it. Shrewdly, del Toro and ""Divergent"" scenarist Vanessa Taylor make the characters as strong a story element as the predicament in which the amphibian finds itself. All good adventure outings require a dangerous antagonist, and Mike Shannon does a fantastic job making Richard Strickland a thoroughly obnoxious dastard. Nevertheless, they don't skimp on his character. The subplots involving Strickland's purchase of a 1962 Cadillac and his marriage are hilarious. Even peripheral characters, like General Hoyt, stand out. Unfortunately, gifted as she is, Oscar-winning Octavia Spencer appears to have been cast primarily because she played in ""The Help,"" and del Toro and Taylor exploit this advantage in amusing little ways. Unquestionably, ""The Shape of Water"" is as implausibly preposterous but entertaining as the 2006 M. Night Shyamalan fantasy ""The Lady in the Water."""
"howard.schumann","8","23","43","20 December 2017"," An engaging, if predictable, ""fantasy for adults""
","While we know that some monsters are decidedly not lovable, the creature in Mexican director Guillermo del Toro's The Shape of Water, like many humans who roam the planet, is more of a lonely outcast seeking connection than a life-threatening presence. Performed by Doug Jones (""The Danger Element"") underneath all the prosthetics, this monster is an amphibian humanoid known as the Asset, captured by scientists from the Amazon (the one in South America) to help with the U.S. space program. Amphibian man (as he is listed in the credits) resembles a cross between King Kong and E.T., though definitely not as cuddly as the latter but a much better dancer. <br/><br/>The Asset is also an unabashed romantic who loves hard-boiled eggs, which is even strange for a human and enjoys Benny Goodman which is not as strange but, as del Toro says, ""What is ridiculous can also be sublime."" Sublime or not, The Shape of Water is an engaging if predictable ""fantasy for adults"" as del Toro characterizes it. The film explores the connection between the amphibious man and Elisa Esposito (Sally Hawkins, ""Maudie""), a mute janitor who works the night shift in the Occam Aerospace Research Center. Elisa lives by herself in Baltimore in an apartment above an old-fashioned movie palace that plays biblical epics in Cinemascope to a few remaining diehards.<br/><br/>Set in the early 1960s during the Cold War, stereotyped forever as an age of social conformity, the film seems to be a warning to those who look back on the golden days with starry eyes by showing us how a part of our history has been marked by racism, homophobia, and xenophobia. In the opening scene, Elisa is asleep in a room filled with water as the narrator, whom we later find out is her neighbor Giles (Richard Jenkins), describes her as a princess in a fairy tale and Alexandre Desplat's score persuades us that the world is filled with childlike wonder, but it is a hard sell. As Elisa awakens from her dream, she goes about her routine - making hard-boiled eggs, taking a bath, making sandwiches and watching TV with Giles who is a gay commercial artist and has just lost his job for reasons unspecified, but we can guess. <br/><br/>Though unable to speak, Elisa communicates at work with Zelda (Octavia Spencer, ""Gifted""), a supportive friend and co-worker who knows sign language. Elisa's routine undergoes a radical shuffling when the Asset arrives in a pressurized water tank. Controlled by arch-villain Colonel Strickland (Michael Shannon, ""Nocturnal Animals"") who carries a cattle prod and who we quickly realize is the real monster in the film. Strickland plans to send the Asset into outer space where, if he wasn't lonesome before, he will now really know what lonesome is. The self-righteous and bullying Strickland is responsible for protecting fish-man from the Russians who he fears may snatch him to either kill him or use him to gain an advantage for their space program.
 
Tentative at first, Elisa senses that she has something going with the Asset and teaches him sign language which proves he has a good head on his shoulders as well as other functioning body parts. She then introduces him to the hard-boiled egg which he devours and soothes him with the music of Benny Goodman as they do a perfect imitation of Ginger Rogers and Fred Astaire. Underneath her outward persona, Elisa has a big heart and big ideas. Once she learns that Strickland wants to cut her new friend open to better understand how he breathes, she makes plans to capture the sexy creature and put him in her bathtub until he can be released into the ocean at high tide. <br/><br/>Aiding her in her scheme are the Russian mole, Dr. Hoffstetler (Michael Stuhlbarg, ""Call Me by Your Name""), Giles, unfortunately stereotyped as being weak and fearful, and Elisa's dependable friend Zelda who joins the group as a late arrival. The heist itself is genuinely exciting and the strongest part of the film with much of the pleasure seeing the expressions on Strickland's face. From the capture, there is the chase, and then the romance which is unorthodox to say the least, all taking place as the sadistic Strickland displays fewer and fewer redeeming qualities. <br/><br/>The Shape of Water has some lovely moments and unique special effects, and the inclusion of pop songs from the 1940s such as ""Hello, Frisco, Hello's"" ""You'll Never Know,"" and Glenn Miller's rendition of ""I Know Why (and so do you),"" from the film ""Sun Valley Serenade"" help to capture the aura of nostalgia. Unfortunately, however, the film's potential is thwarted by one-dimensional characters who hammer us constantly with a message that we have already figured out. While The Shape of Water shouts ""magic and wonder,"" it ultimately falls short of conveying it."
"gavinp9","8","41","83","12 January 2018"," Different and enjoyable love story
","'The Shape of Water' is del Toro's 10th film, and one of his best - better than 'Pan's Labyrinth', in my books. It's an interesting tale about a mute woman Elisa (Hawkins), who works as a cleaner at a military base with her friend, Zelda (Spencer). There they find that Strickland (Shannon) has brought something strange back to the base. Since he's shown in the trailer & posters, it's not really a spoiler to say that Doug Jones plays an Abe Sapien-like creature (man, I wish they'd make 'Hellboy III'!) Elisa and ""the asset"" begin to connect and we're off on a peculiar journey.<br/><br/>The film does well to integrate the fantastic with the real world, with everything looking like the 1960's and the racism, sexism and prejudice is still on display. There's also an interesting sub-plot of the Cold War, with Russian spies - and a bit of a sad ending there, but also slyly funny. All the actors are great - Jenkins as the helpful friend/neighbour, Spencer as the chatty/funny work friend, Stuhlbarg as the scientist, Shannon as the bad guy - always excellent - and Jones and Hawkins as the silent, but super-expressive leads.<br/><br/>The other main stars are colour and water - everything's either a motif of green, blue or teal, and the use of water as a transition between scenes is great. The score's good and the film never seems hurried - except for one scene - but isn't too long either. There's moments of violence and comedy between the question of how does he exist? But mostly, it's a pleasant story about love and identity, with a solid ending and excellent cinematography."

Ummmm...<br/><br/>A good one, though, a touching one with all those amazing fantasies, all the different forms of love, some of which may not look like love but still is, and all the metaphors and discussions about beauty. However... I mean there must be reasons why everyone's recalling Beauty and the Beast... But being old stuff is not really what i want to judge. For me a good story is worth telling thousands of times in thousands of ways. The thing is, the film is talking just tooooo straight forward. <br/><br/>A crowd of minorities. Well I'm minority myself, and i think there's absolutely no problem to try to be politically correct. But with literally ALL kinds of minorities? I do feel a bit too much. I mean it makes sense to use the disabled, the Black, the gay guy, along with the monster, to reflect discrimination (no offense at all to anyone above). But i don't find it necessary, and do find it crowded, to have ALL these politically correct features. And that just makes the meanings of (anti-) discrimination repetitive and didactic. There could have been more space left out for audiences to think, rather than just directly filling their mind with what you wanna say. <br/><br/>And the ending is... at least for me it's kinda too incredible. Wow suddenly Elisa is a mermaid too!... I know there are clues before, and i understand it's the only possible way to make a happy ending, but i don't feel like i need that. Back to the political correct point, a far-fetched happy ending is more like a pure fairy tale than something thought-provoking. <br/><br/>But again i love the discussion of what the Lord is like and the scene when they make love.

Few minutes after the end of the movie I knew: she resembles the little mermaid who sacrificed her voice, long hair, her immortal life etc. for coming in the human world just for a prince's sake, losing almost everything. This time another little mermaid chose to live in the human world, in a humble and mostly inward way. She was turned back to life and taken away to the sea by a man of her kind.

","I just love movies like The Shape of Water. Not because it's particularly imaginative (it is) or because it's decorated to the brim with lavish costume, set and creature design (it is), or even because it's thematically ballsy (it very, very, very much is). No – I like movies like The Shape of Water because it is a rare glimpse into the mind of an original creator, cashing in most of his good will and gambling his professional reputation on a film he/she has nearly complete control over and that encapsulates everything they like and care about. George Lucas did it for Star Wars (1977), Christopher Nolan did it for Inception (2010), Zack Snyder did it for Sucker Punch (2011) and now Guillermo Del Toro has done it for The Shape of Water.<br/><br/>The film takes place in a fable-esque early sixties Baltimore amid the height of blind consumerism, social conformity, oblivious futurism and Cold War paranoia. Elisa (Hawkins), a mute janitor working the night shift at a top secret research facility forms a deepening bond with their latest test subject – an aquatic humanoid creature with amazing abilities. But when the creature's handler Agent Strickland (Shannon) decides to kill and dissect the creature, Elisa, along with some unexpected allies form a plan to rescue the creature and keep it hidden until it can be freed.<br/><br/>The Shape of Water is first and foremost a compendium of very interesting, very different ideas all melting into fine bubbly brine. It's part monster movie in the vogue of Creature from the Black Lagoon (1954), part sweeping romance in the mode of Romeo and Juliet. There are shades of 1950's opulence, 1930's escapism and bit of 1960's civil unrest seething just out of frame. A little of Pan's Labyrinth (2006), a little Red Scare cloak and dagger stuff and an overall feel that conjures memories of playing Bioshock when I was a teen (though that last one may not have been purposeful).<br/><br/>Even if none of those particulars appeal to you, the craft and detail in this film can hardly disguise the unbridled passion that's infused in every retro-verve window pane and dingy aquarium. This is not just a world you can touch but one you can feel as exemplified by, among other things, Alexandre Desplat's wistfully nostalgic score and Guillermo Del Toro and Vanessa Taylor's mood-setting screenplay. The result is a strong, consistent tone that evokes a feeling of longing for a forgotten past that may have existed in another dimension.<br/><br/>Story-wise, the film more-or-less unravels exactly how you'd expect with the only surprises coming in the form of visceral extremes. This may arguably be one of the film's few weaknesses though considering it unravels like a fable, you can't really blame it for following through on its tragi-romantic precepts. Every time we as the audience are lulled into a sense of complacency, the film punctuates the moment with short bursts of gruesome violence, sleepy flights of fantasy and/or, shall we say unique sexual circumstance. These moments of adult content, rather than distract, amplify the overall experience like large crystals of sea salt on sweet caramel. It plays out like a dark, bloody, carnal fable whereby true love is a given and monsters are there to be vanquished.<br/><br/>The largest monster in the film is Michael Shannon who plays the menacing Strickland. From one point of view, he's a dedicated family man, a patriotic American and an incorruptible company man. Yet his ruthlessness betrays him, showing that his inner core is just as rotten as his fingers, which the creature bit off and doctors haphazardly reattached. In this situation and in the eyes of Elisa, he's a villain of biblical proportions.<br/><br/>Though not to be outdone in the monster department, the distinctive 6' 3'"" Doug Jones manages amazing feats as the amphibian creature. Behind layers of makeup and prosthetics the giant figure has the same level of expressiveness as the demure Sally Hawkins only with occasion to be primal when the need arises. Hawkins, Jenkins, Spencer and Stuhlbarg are all given a chance to imbue their characters with an inner life. Where in lesser hands they'd be relegated to stock, here the black maid becomes the privileged gatekeeper, the communist stooge becomes the moral arbiter and the gay confidante becomes the fallen man given new life.<br/><br/>This bring me to the films larger flaw – because we're given so much time to get to know everyone, some of the more romantic moments come across a little unearned. This judgment isn't entirely fair given a lot of ""romance"" movies suffer from the same problem, but not every movie has an amphibian creature playing paddy-cakes with the gal from Paddington (2014). I for one would have liked to see a few more scenes of them getting to know each other before Elisa goes ALF on everyone's a**es. Of course adding a scene or two may ruin the pacing of the film, which is as artfully maintained as everything else in this film.<br/><br/>Even at his worst director Guillermo Del Toro knows how to use film language; to make us feel for those tap-dancing across the screen with dreamy grace. The Shape of Water is with little uncertainty one of his best and most powerful films to date. It is a beautiful looking, lovingly crafted and as previously mentioned ballsy movie featuring some of today's best ensemble acting and best Auteur (with a capital A) filmmaking. As of now The Shape of Water is on limited release but if it's playing at a theater near you, you should definitely check it out."
"kaptenvideo-89875","8","13","22","15 February 2018"," Guillermo Del Toro did it again, and this time in a way that speaks not only to his fans, but everyone
","At a top secret research facility in the Cold War era America of 1960s, a lowly janitor (Sally Hawkins) forms a friendship with an amphibious creature that is being held in captivity.<br/><br/>Also playing, Michael Shannon, Richard Jenkins, Octavia Stevens, Michael Stuhlbarg, Doug Jones, Nick Searcy et al.<br/><br/>Fairy tales are for children, right? Well, no. An adult life is so intricately intervowen with them that it gets difficult to say where the fairy tales end and ""reality"" begins.<br/><br/>I am not only talking about mass media, advertisement and promoting industry or such. Seemingly everybody has their own version of How Life Is and How It Should Be in their head which they try to distribute as far and wide as they think they can get away with.<br/><br/>Considering that fairy tales are everywhere, it is only suitable that one of this Oscar season's biggest and best reviewed movies, ""The Shape of Water"", is a fairy tale too. Movie industry has always been about selling us dreams, and this golden figure is its highest and most prestigious accolade.<br/><br/>It's rated R for sex, profanities and violence, and has quite a surprising amount of each, but aside from that, it would not go ""over the head"" of some younger viewers too. Because above all, it's a simple story well told, and for its delicious visual style, understandable and easily digestible for widest possible audience.<br/><br/>Not that I suggest this kind of sex and violence to children - but on the other hand, what exactly here would be new and shocking to them?<br/><br/>Given how delicious and majestic it all looks, it comes as a slight disappointment that the story is so straightworward.<br/><br/>The main author, co-writer and director Guillermo Del Toro, is playing with some powerful symbols - water, the sea, amphibian creatures, oppressing regime - but as usual, he's satisfied with how everything looks and fits together, not interested to guide us somewhere deep. He's always been a visual kind of storyteller, so here he delivers in spades.<br/><br/>Even the first scene depicting sunken apartment looks nothing short of breathtaking and makes one want to see him directing a possible ""BioShock"" movie (a loved videogame which begs to be translated on cinema screen). How ""Water"" looks would be such a great blueprint for it. Every frame looks like a painting, or something.<br/><br/>The only thing I really found lacking is the awful pronounciation of Russian language on screen. Given how many instructors and teachers work for movie industry to make things on screen look and seem more authentic, it's horrible to see some things still stay the same.<br/><br/>Or wouldn't the general audiences ""buy"" the Russian language which sounds like the real thing, just like Nigerian prince type of scam letters are supposed to be written in horrible English?<br/><br/>But it's not just all about pretty pictures. Luckily for us, whatever depth the story may lack, has been compensated with emotion encapsulated by the performances.<br/><br/>I see no need to talk about these in length, because every major player is doing his/her usual - Hawkins is quirky and lovable as always, Jenkins endearing and a bit eccentric as always, Shannon intense and towering tour de fource as always. You can be sure that they deliver. Which is great considering that many of the scenes were filmed in front of empty green screen, with digital objects added later.<br/><br/>But the amphibian creature motion capture acted by Doug Jones is the real star here - such an attention-grabbing mix of human and alien attributes, all these little sounds he makes and all. The movie would be poorer if the centre of the show was not as successfully realized as it is. I loved him!<br/><br/>In conclusion, it's a quite captivating fairy tale for adults, filled with dark themes as the fairy tales have always been. ""The Shape of Water"" celebrates all that we have always loved in mainstream cinema - emotion, visual artistry, mix of old-fashioned and modern - and as such is a perfect frontrunner for Oscar season indeed.<br/><br/>By the way, it's quite rare for a movie to get nominated for 13 Oscars as ""The Shape of Water"" did. It has only happened nine times before (there are also three movies that were nominated for 14).<br/><br/>I have a gut feeling that ""Water"" will get its awards mostly in ""technical"" categories such as best director, sound editing, sound mixing, production design, and cinematography - as opposed to best movie, original screenplay, or acting categories.<br/><br/>And this would be OK, because this year's nominations are a tough bunch indeed, and I'd be sad to see ""Ebbing"" lose for example."

"valleyjohn","6","27","52","16 February 2018"," Seriously over hyped
","There are some actors and directors that can do no wrong in the eyes of The Academy and serious critics. Guillermo del Toro is definitely one of those directors. Don't get me wrong , he has made some very good films but sadly , in my opinion , The Shape of Water is definitely not one of them.
In the hidden high security government laboratory where she works, lonely Elisa is trapped in a life of isolation. Elisa's life is changed forever when she and co-worker Zelda discover a secret classified experiment on a water based man like creature. Elisa finds she is falling in love with a creature that others want dead.<br/><br/>I really do not know what all the fuss was about with this film. Sure , Sally Hawkins and Michael Shannon are good but they usually always are. This had the feel of an average story that you might have seen on an episode of The Twilight Zone . For a Del Toro film the special affects were very average , almost like a B movie from back in the day. Perhaps that was what he was trying to achieve ?
Why this is has been nominated for 13 Oscars is a mystery to me because this film was average at best."

","Even when I haven't been in love with Del Toro's past work the guy knows how to create wonderful environments and atmosphere. The window dressing in this movie is gorgeous. The sets look real, yet they have enough style to draw your attention. From the apartment to the government facility, there was never a point where something wasn't eye-catching or visually impressive. This is always the highlight of Guillermo's films for me, there's always a great sense of style that brings a unique edge. I haven't even touched on how Amphibian Man (Doug Jones) great as a character looks. He does have some similarities to Abe Sapien but he still has enough different aspects to be a completely new character. This movie is worth seeing just for how creative and lavish the visuals in this movie are.<br/><br/>I also thought the setting of the movie added to making it tenser. The movie takes place during the Cold War and the movie benefits from the tension that they play with. Anyone could be a double agent and I dug how they handled the character of Dmitri. They even had good small touches with posters in the background saying things like Loose Lips Sink Ships. The Shape of Water also has some surprisingly suspenseful scenes and some gory violence. Something like that could have felt tacked on but it gave me something to focus on when other parts of the movie weren't working for me.<br/><br/>The other amazing aspect of this movie was the acting. Everyone across the board brought their A-game. Sally Hawkins was great as Elisa, there was so much subtle work in her performance. She conveys so much through her body language and there were some risky choices with her character that she nailed. Richard Jenkins was also phenomenal as Giles. He gives a very quiet but impacting performance. Michael Shannon is great as the villain, he borders on being cartoonish without falling into chewing the scenery. I also really liked Michael Stuhlbarg as Dr. Hoffstetler. He was one of my favourite parts of Men In Black 3 and he's a really strong character actor when he's given good material. Octavia Spencer was solid, but I wish she had been given more to do than act like Octavia Spencer. Doug Jones was also really good, he has to do a lot under all that makeup, but he still gets the job done.<br/><br/>The only thing that fell flat for me was the romance between Elisa and Amphibian Man. Unfortunately, this is one of the big aspects of the movie, so I couldn't just shove it aside. I liked both of their characters, but the movie was obviously going for a Beauty and the Beast vibe and it was just not working for me. I know that I'm in the minority on this and I still enjoyed the movie outside of it, but it did distract me enough to avoid giving this a higher grade.<br/><br/>I also had a real mix of emotions about the ending. I don't know if I would have chosen to go another way, but they go with a crowd-pleaser instead of something a little more realistic. I agree with other user reviews on here that it seems like it was going for more of a fable/fairytale feeling but it also came off as a little sappy to me. There are movies that need to have a happy ending so maybe Guillermo decided that The Shape of Water was one of those.<br/><br/>The critics have adored this movie and I can see why. This is a film-buff movie, there's more than a few scenes paying homage to classic movies. I think that people will enjoy this regardless even though it does run a little long. I couldn't buy into one of the bigger aspects of the plot but I still highly recommend this movie. What it gets right, it does so with flying colours and it is worth seeing just for that."

It was the good, friendly monster that had to be rescued by the mean nasty government plot and, especially if you are a child of the 80s, it works. It's a plot that we've seen over and over again...only in kids movies.<br/><br/>This Fish F***er movie, the plot is made for adults, so less adventure and fart jokes and a lot more beauty slightly deeper issues, issues that equate homosexual and racial issues to being the outsider that matters...in the right way. Not the immature and racist way that we see in Black Panther and Get Out...<br/><br/>...so it's refreshing to see that handled subtly and politely and still make the point. <br/><br/>Subtle and polite hardly go hand in hand with a serious point now days.<br/><br/>The Shape of Water was able to hint at a point, still entertain, and, well, do it in a way that was so beautiful it was mesmerizing."

"achyutaghosh","9","26","50","4 March 2018"," a magical romance
","The Shape of Water is grounded in magical realism, a genre which combines elements of magic in an extremely realistic environment, but in essence is a twisted monster-fairy tale. Most monster stories have featured infatuations with things of beauty, only to end sadly with the monster protagonists, ala King Kong. The Shape of Water though is progressive-it follows through to a happy ending for both it's monster/god central character and it's human lover. And unlike the human converting the monster into another human (Beauty and the Beast) , it has the monster converting the human to, well, it's type. <br/><br/>The story is set at the height of the Cold War, 1962, where everything that every American used to do was looked through the filter of being pro-communism. Elisa Esposito, played to Academy award nominated perfection by Sally Hawkins, is a mute cleaning lady working at a top secret research institute in Baltimore. An amphibious creature (called The Asset), and played emotively by Doug Jones, is brought from the Amazon to the lab by Strickland, played in perverse style by Michael Shannon. <br/><br/>""The natives in the Amazon worshipped it. Like a god. We need to take it apart, learn how it works""<br/><br/>Merman or god, he is not in for a good time at the research institute, and typical of del Toro movies, humans are more monstrous than conventional monsters. Elisa's lack of speech helps form a bond with the Asset. Speaking of whom, he is curiously similar to del Toro's other amphibious character from Hellboy- Abe Sapien. Love for eggs, and classical music is all there. Understanding the finality of the creature's fate, Elisa, with her friends, hatches a plan to take it away from the institute. <br/><br/>""When he looks at me, the way he looks at me... He does not know, what I lack... Or - how - I am incomplete. He sees me, for what I - am, as I am. He's happy - to see me. Every time. Every day. Now, I can either save him... or let him die.""<br/><br/>Soon the bond translates to love, but the creature is dying, and needs open water to survive. After that the plot focuses on racing against the Communists and Strickland to set it free in the sea. The ending is deliciously open ended too- does Elisa survive in the end or that is what the narrator wants us to think? Was she a mermaid in human guise? Does the story have a happy ending, however improbable it may be? <br/><br/>Guillermo del Toro is at his best in The Shape of Water. His love for monsters shows in his body of work (Hellboy, Pacific Rim, Pan's Labyrinth, Crimson Peak), and The Shape of Water is no different here. Del Toro creates a fascinating world, full of relatable characters, and drily so, takes digs at today's environment. The central human character is probably a Mexican, the villain is a gun-loving white man, and if a love story between an animal and human isn't awkward enough, there is an old man in the movie who is secretly gay! What would Trump say about that last bit? <br/><br/>If the first ace for The Shape of Water was the characters, the next ace is the script. It is delightfully funny, even for those who do not talk and communicate only through expressions and signs. The third ace though is the real deal- he manages to extract superb performances from all the actors. Be it Sally Hawkins, Richard Jenkins, Octavia Spencer, or Michael Shannon. <br/><br/>Nominated for 13 Oscars, with 93 wins and 263 other nominations- is the hype real and is The Shape of Water the best film of 2017? Might not be, but seriously, who could have thought that something so unconventional could be so romantic? Here is raising a glass to Elisa Esposito's groundbreaking romance!"
"davidgee","8","26","50","22 February 2018"," Enchanting but daft!
","Back in the 1950s we used to see sci-fi movies like THE QATERMASS EXPERIMENT and I MARRIED A MONSTER FROM OUTER SPACE, shot on desperately low budgets but satisfyingly scary for their time - more than a little daft. THE SHAPE OF WASTER is a 'throwback' to that era<br/><br/>Guillermo del Toro is not new to 'creature features' or, as he would prefer to call them, fairy tales for adults. There are some very adult scenes in this movie - a pity in a way since it excludes the younger audience who would be enchanted by it. The theme is not too far removed from Spielberg's E.T. or CLOSE ENCOUNTERS with Elisa replacing the children captivated (captured, even) by aliens. Michael Shannon's brutal facility chief is the equivalent of the Nazi bounty-hunters in an Indiana Jones adventure. There's also a good-guy professor, and Sally Hawkins has a sassy sidekick in fellow cleaning-lady Olivia Spencer.<br/><br/>For all the wondrous CGI and make-up, the Creature is still visibly an actor (Doug Jones) wrapped in plastic. The budget was clearly awesome. I'm not sure that it really deserves to be getting all these Awards and Nominations. I couldn't help remembering all those 1950s sci-fi horrors. Yes, it's a beguiling fantasy romance but it's also totally - epically - daft."

","I had seen the trailer a number of times at least a month before the release of this movie, it was definitely among those films nominated during Awards Season that I was most excited about going to see, from Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe winning director Guillermo del Toro (Hellboy, Pan's Labyrinth). Basically Elisa Esposito (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Sally Hawkins) is mute and communicates through sign language, her inability to speak is the result of a mysterious neck injury, she was found with these scars as a child. She lives alone above a movie theatre and works as a janitor at a secret government laboratory in Baltimore during the Cold War in 1962. Her only two friends are her next-door neighbour Giles (Oscar nominated, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Richard Jenkins), and her African-American co-worker Zelda Delilah Fuller (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Octavia Spencer), who also serves as her interpreter at work. The facility receives a mysterious creature in a tank, which has been captured a river in South Arica by Colonel Richard Strickland (Michael Shannon). Elisa is curious, and discovers the creature is a humanoid amphibian (Hellboy's Doug Jones), she begins visiting the creature in secret, forming a close bond with it. General Frank Hoyt (Nick Searcy) is seeking to exploit the creature for possible advantages in the Space Race, he orders Strickland to vivisect it. Scientist Dr. Robert Hoffstetler (Michael Stuhlbarg) pleads unsuccessfully to keep the creature alive for further study, he is secretly a Soviet spy, he is ordered by his superiors to euthanise the creature. Elisa learns what the Americans have planned for the creature, and she convinces Giles to help her to free him, Hoffstetler discovers her plan and chooses to help her, and Zelda becomes involved. The escape is successful, Elisa keeps the creature at her apartment in the bathtub, adding large amounts of salt to the water, she plans to release him into the nearby canal when it opens to the ocean in a few days. Strickland is adamant to recover the creature, he interrogates Elisa and Zelda, his aggressive attitude is mostly aimed towards Elisa, but she is unprovoked, he dismisses them. Back at the apartment, Giles discovers the creature has eaten one of his cats, the startled creature slashes Giles' arm and dashes from the apartment. Elisa finds the creature hiding in the cinema downstairs, she returns him to her apartment, the creature touches Giles balding head and his wounded arm, the next morning Giles finds his hair is partly growing back and his wounds are healed. Elisa and the creature soon become romantically involved, she turns on all taps, undresses, and they have sex as the bathroom floods, causing leaks into the cinema below. Hoyt gives Strickland an ultimatum to recover the creature within 36 hours, while Hoffstetler is told by his handlers that he will be extracted in two days, and as the day of release is approaching, the health of the creature is declining. Hoffstetler leaves the laboratory to rendezvous with his handlers, Strickland follows him, Hoffstetler is shot by one of his handlers, but Strickland shoots the handlers dead, and he tortures Hoffstetler for information to find the creature. Hoffstetler tells about Elisa and Zelda before succumbing to his wounds and dying, Strickland threatens Zelda in her home, her terrified husband Brewster (Martin Roach) reveals Elisa is keeping the creature. Strickland searches Elisa's apartment, but she, Giles and the creature have already left, but he finds a note on the calendar revealing she is taking the creature to the canal. Elisa and Giles are bidding farewell to the creature at the canal, but Strickland arrives and attacks them all, he knocks Giles down and shoots the creature and Elisa, who both appear to die. However, the creature heals himself, he slashes Strickland's throat, the police and Zelda arrive at the scene, the creature takes Elisa and jumps into the canal, deep in the water he heals her and transforms her neck scars into gills, the closing narration by Giles expresses belief that Elisa lived ""happily ever after"" with the creature. Also starring David Hewlett as Fleming and Lauren Lee Smith as Elaine Strickland. Hawkins gives a heartfelt performance at the silent cleaner who forms a relationship with a webbed fish-man, Jenkins and Spencer do very well as her well-meaning friends, but mention should also go to Shannon, the real monster of the picture who sees the beautiful creature as an abomination. The story could be described as ""Creature from the Black Lagoon meets Splash"" (and a hint of Beauty and the Beast), the look of the amphibious man is certainly a nod to the Gill Man, it has a feeling of dark strangeness throughout, but it also has tenderness, humour and heart, with brilliant music and special effects, overall it is an intriguing and fabulously different fantasy drama. It won the Oscars for Best Motion Picture of the Year, Best Original Score for Alexandre Desplat and Best Production Design, and it was nominated for Best Original Screenplay for Guillermo del Toro and Vanessa Taylor, Best Cinematography, Best Costume Design, Best Sound Editing, Best Sound Mixing and Best Film Editing, it won the BAFTAs for Best Film, Best Production Design and Best Original Music, and it was nominated for Best Original Screenplay, Best Costume Design, Best Editing, Best Cinematography, Best Sound and Best Special Visual Effects, and it won the Golden Globe for Best Original Score, and it was nominated for Best Motion Picture - Drama and Best Screenplay.

"coreyjdenford","8","26","50","14 February 2018"," An underwater masterpiece
","This review of The Shape of Water is spoiler free<br/><br/>**** (4/5)<br/><br/>FROM PAN'S LABYRINTH, through Hellboy, via The Devil's Backbone to Crimson Peak, throughout his filmography Mexican director Guillermo del Toro has always had a way with creating intricate storylines with a simple character you can route for from start to finish. He's always had a way of layering his stories like an onion; firstly there's the simple opening - this can be the lead character or the narration of the story. Secondly there's the development of the character. Then there's the technical stuff; what the film looks like, what kind of visuals there are and what the storytelling entails through the visuals. And lastly there's the intricate ending whether its open ended (the first Hellboy) or it's closed ended (most of his others). This, essentially has given the Mexican native a career that's unlike most other directors, plus he can't be the only director out there who makes fairytale romance and horror work. Previously it was his gothically enchanting creep-fest Crimson Peak, there he went the supernatural route when a woman fell in love with a ghost. With his latest The Shape of Water he has achieved something on the level of La La Land; here he has made a beautiful, delicious and truly magical love story, which is as much of a paean to the world of cinema as it is a visually stunning, beautifully shot love story. One that takes you on a mesmerising ride from start to finish. 
 
We start with the simple route in the story; Elisa (Hawkins) is a mute woman who makes her living, working as a late-night janitor at a secret government facility in Baltimore during the Cold War in the early 1960's. At first, she's isolated living in an apartment above a cinema, and the only person she has for company is her neighbour (Jenkins), a has-been advertising artist who is her friend and confidant if she ever feels lonely. Her life revolves around watching old musicals, however despite the war setting there's only a tiny glimpse of war on a TV screen, and that's pretty much it other than that image war never makes an introduction through this story. Like in his other films, and his well-rounded characters here he wants to keep reality firmly at the bay (or in this case the water). But reality isn't an option with del Toro, there's always something that takes his storytelling to a level above reality, and this one is no exception to his fairytale storytelling. Elisa's life is seemingly at a dead-end, constantly working the same shift until the scientists find a mysterious amphibious creature, which looks like a mutant experiment between that creature off The Black Lagoon and Hellboy's Abe Sapien, and she slowly starts to fall in love with the creature. 
 
And it's here where the story shows off its true blue-ish colour. Like Pan's Labyrinth before it, this one is visually stunning, it's beautifully shot (a stunning shot of the creature coming out of his pool doesn't go without a mention), its inertly sweet, warm-hearted and charming. Through every moment his story is absorbed by exceptional performances, however full praise here goes to Hawkins who dazzles as the mousy mute lead. Also like Labyrinth, The Shape of Water has its darker routes; here we have Michael Shannon playing as ruthless G-man Agent Strickland, who sees the creature as a freak that must be tamed right away. He does anything to see his asset get hurt in vicious ways, and does anything to stop his escape. 
 
Of course you have to credit del Toro's imagination who keeps the story strictly romantic (a standout shot of Elisa seducing the creature) and it truly works on that side up until the end. Sadly, The Shape of Water isn't as good as it should've been it doesn't thoroughly work throughout and as much as it's imaginative storytelling follows original spates, there are moments where the storytelling falls to repetition of del Toro's other fables. Still, the film is a truly enchanting, mesmerising and magical one, that won't be forgotten any time soon.

"MovieSoup","8","38","77","20 February 2018"," I loved this film and it hopefully will get an Oscar.
","The Shape of water will, in a few years, be one of those films that is a classic watch. It really made me feel emotional, there are a lot of characters who develop in natural ways and the whole story is simple yet effective. I will explain why I loved this film and will explain the few things I had a problem with. <br/><br/>The pacing of the film is slightly stilted in places. No spoilers but in some scenes there are plot errors that you sit there thinking ""ok how did he know to go to the docks"" or ""why did she not just do that in the first place"". <br/><br/>Also the fact that the effects of the creature were practical, while commendable, left me feeling that more was needed CGI wise to make him look a bit more realistic. It's not a major thing for me if the plot has holes and the practical effects look a little shaky but it is a noticeable thing that took me out of the movie a bit which ultimately loses points. <br/><br/>The story is just so beautiful. Del Toro's best story since Pans Labyrinth HANDS DOWN. It revolves mainly around a mute woman (Elisa played masterfully by Sally Hawkins) feeling incomplete in her life. Elisa does the same boring things day in day out BUT then happens upon this creature that is her missing piece. I strongly identified with Elisa as, on a personal level, I've felt incomplete at times, as if something is missing and sally Hawkins plays the role so well. The best thing about this film is this charming, unlikely love story that is told so well and with a great deal of emotion. <br/><br/>All the actors bring their A game. Michael Shannon is brilliant as the security guy who is himself incomplete and tries to buy his way out of feeling this way. His character is a little cheesy in places like when he tries his scare tactics. They sometimes work and are menacing and other times the dialog feels clique and just copied from any other movie. <br/><br/>Octavia Spencer gives a fantastic performance as Zelda. She also is incomplete and uses Elisa as a sort of therapy tool. She talks to her constantly as Elisa can only listen to her problems because she is a mute. He husband doesn't understand her and ignores her half the time so Elisa is doing all the listening which really adds another level to their friendship. This film is a great example of how a great supporting cast can add so much to a story and it added that extra bit of enjoyment to every scene for me. <br/><br/>Technical stuff is really excellent and is very much in keeping with the period it is set in. There is a ballroom scene that is shot in black and white and is just wonderful to watch. The cinematography in this is excellent. There are a lot of greens, blues and teal colour pallets used to resemble the sea and the colours water gives off. When we deviate to a sub plot the colour seems to change giving me a sense of tonal shift that is just really interesting to note and separates the different characters from their respective plots. <br/><br/>The 1950's/1960's music is brilliant and it help create the cold war atmosphere that this film is set in. It has a distinct theatrical theme that presents the romance as something that is ""straight out of the movies"" and a romance that is just time less. Again going back the ballroom scene as a prime example of the way Elisa and the creature feel about each other. The music swirls all around like they are both swimming in one another's feeling for each other. <br/><br/>Needless to say I found this film very emotionally powerful and entertaining. There are points that don't work and it's not a 10/10 but it made me look at my own sense of incompletion. At the end of the day isn't that what art is meant to do? Make you feel and look within to find a sense of self? For that reason this film will always be a favourite of mine. This film deserves at least one Oscar. Really Worth a Watch."
"RinKaV3","7","34","68","21 March 2018"," Interesting but strange at the same time
","It was pretty strange to watch, since the movie was a little bit different than the most recent movies, well at least in my opinion. It isn't bad that it is strange to watch it, it is strange in a good way and it's amazing in the same moment, how you are able to express your feelings without saying a single word and how fast you can get attached to others. All in all, a superb movie by Guillermo del Toro."
"Mork_the_Borg","2","34","68","8 March 2018"," When a movie is exceeding human thresholds that define normality
","No doubt master-class cinematography, but there's a subtle undertone which is not related to empathy, at least not in my own humble opinion, and using a movie to share this to a wider audience is somewhat tricky and to some extent borderline manipulation. The first thing is trying to show a vision that normalizes relationships between older men and much younger individuals (Giles and the Pie Man), and the second thing is trying to normalize inter-species relationships (human-being and fish-being) where for some weird reason a fish-being eating a cat is seen as completely natural. Is it natural for a human being to have sex with a horse, dog or dolphin (after all dolphins are extremely intelligent), as long as there's ""love"" involved? Don't know, but this movie is playing with some very weird definitions of healthy relationships. To be honest, in my opinion it has crossed a number of very clear lines (thinking pedophilia and bestiality here). If we're trying to normalize everything that's occurring on our tiny planet, then will any norms and values be safe at all? Is this movie all about showing empathy, or is it trying to open doors to behavior that's simply unacceptable?"

"bowmanblue","7","37","75","20 February 2018"," Del Toro does it again
","'The Shape of Water' is the latest movie from Guillermo and, if you've seen anything he's done before, you should have a good idea of what you're going to get. I'd say, out of all his previous work, this is closest to the much-lauded 'Pan's Labyrinth.' Personally, I enjoyed that one, too, but I do recall one of my friends saying something about how he went into the film expecting a monster/sci-fi/fantasy film and all he got was a war film with a couple of fantastical scenes. Okay, so his appraisal was technically correct, however I stand with the majority of audiences when I say I didn't mind that - just like I didn't mind that 'The Shape of Water' was basically a war film with a monster thrown in there.<br/><br/>However, that than being a subtitled film set during the Second World War, this time we go a little closer to present day and find ourselves in 'Cold War' America where government agents have captured a mysterious humanoid/reptilian life-form and intend to use it in their space-race (I'm not sure how this was to be achieved, but never mind!). Again, anyone who has seen any of Del Toro's previous films where a humanoid aquatic creature is involved, can probably picture what this one looks like (especially as it's even played by the same actor!). And, it's fair to say that this weird-looking half-fish-man isn't having a whale of a time (pun intended). He's routinely tortured by scientists and equally-creepy men in black (primarily) by Michael Shannon - who's probably more of a monster than the monster itself thanks to his overuse of an electronic cattle-prod device of torture!<br/><br/>However, just when it looks like our fishy friend is doomed to a life of torture and dissection, he's befriended by young cleaning lady (Elisa, played by Sally Hawkins) who's also completely mute. They then form a bizarre friendship which - hopefully - will lead to a better life for both of them.<br/><br/>I enjoyed 'The Shape of Water,' but I can see that it's probably not for everyone. If you're a fan of Del Toro's other work then you'll like it. The sets and period details and perfect and a wonderfully-magic atmosphere is created out of a normally mundane setting. At first I found it a little weird, having a protagonist who never uttered a word for the entire two-hour runtime, but Hawkins is a capable lead and uses all other bodily actions and expressions to convey just what she's thinking and feeling (plus she can curse using sign language!). Like I say, it is two hours and, although beautiful to watch, does tend to feel a little overly-long here and there.<br/><br/>Richard Jenkins plays Elisa's friend and provides some much-needed 'heart' and humour into the film, but the stand-out goes to Michael Shannon, who portrays the most sinister man in black since 'Agent Smith' from 'The Matrix.'<br/><br/>Don't expect wall-to-wall action, think of this as more of a 'Pan's Labyrinth' type film just with more 'signing' and less subtitles. Also, if you have a soft spot for cats, you may want to close your eyes mid-way through - or just never bring a wild monster home if you have pets."

The ending was predictable and appears as one of those you have seen a 1000 times before. Oh, and ofc the Russians are evil.

His position as ""ogre in chief"" is established early , when he wanders into the men's room when the ladies are cleaning, and rather un sheepishly urinates right in front of the two. It would have been easy for the man to simply step into a stall to pee, however, it would have been similarly easy for the ladies to divert their eyes and simply not watch, or also just to walk out and give him his privacy.<br/><br/>Just who is creepier in the above situation is a matter of opinion, but the writers sympathies lie with the ladies as the above mentioned boss is also shown to be a sadist. The lab experiment creature he enjoys beating on, and the same creature falls in love with the cleaning lady, and the movie turns total ""chick flick"" from their on.<br/><br/>The rave reviews are of the sort that makes you think some critics probably think they are supposed to like it.

","Okay, first, the good stuff: <br/><br/>The sets (which deserve an Oscar) and the cinematography were eye-poppingly-amazing. Desplat's score was moving and beautiful. Richard Jenkins stole every scene he was in - as always.<br/><br/>Now, the bad stuff: <br/><br/>Sally Hawkins masturbating in the bath every single morning while the eggs are boiling (hence the title of this review) added nothing to the story. Michael Shannon buying a new car added nothing to the story. The Astaire-Rogers, song-n-dance, black-n-white dream sequence completely ruined any magic that had been established.
Look, I know this is a fantasy, but, fish sex, really? Not only that, she went to work and played kiss-n-tell, describing the fish dick to Octavia Spencer (who, sadly, has become typecast.) The writing was just weak. Every character was a cliched, cardboard cutout. The love story read like a bad Harlequin Romance paperback meets The Creature from the Black Lagoon meets Splash meets Mr. Limpet.<br/><br/>Overall, I would say, if you are a serious filmophile, see this for the eye candy.

"Equalizer16","10","108","246","13 October 2017"," Del Toro's new moving, thrilling romantic fantasy
","If I was to tell you about Guillermo Del Toro's new film what would I say.<br/><br/>As the father of dark fantasy, Guillermo Del Toro knows how to bring alive the illusive wonderlands and nightmares we can relish and transform them into wonderful poignant crafts of insight and meaning, and The Shape of Water is no exception. With its journey from Venice to Toronto, The Shape of Water has now hit the London Film Festival, now within reach of this exuberant critic. I had only the budget to see one film at this year's festival and I most certainly made a wise decision.<br/><br/>During the Cold War conflict of the 60s, a mute but hearing Eliza (Sally Hawkins) works as a cleaner at a secret government facility, where she becomes drawn to the new specimen: a mysterious marine creature (Doug Jones). While Eliza begins to fall in love with it, the facility head Richard Strickland (Michael Shannon), only desires to take the creature apart for experimental advantage against the Russians. Eliza's bond with the creature soon begins to effect those around her: her neighbour Giles (Richard Jenkins), work college Zelda (Octavia Spencer) and scientist Robert Hoffsteder (Michael Stuhbarg) What is amazing profound about Del Toro's latest work is its eccentric visualisation in reflection of the political and social conceptions of the past , but also today. The most centralised end is the the treatment of those who are different. Directly dealing with the fantasy of other species but intertwined with racial treatment relevant to the time in which the film is set, and then of course against the back drop of the national conflicts, but then also the value of those with deficiencies, as portrayed by Sally Hawkins.<br/><br/>More distant from his darker tones in, Pan's Labyrinth, and Crimson Peak, but not far from the surreal fantasy, The Shape of Water becomes more grounded than previous Del Toro films, and diversely more lighter and funnier. With frequent laughs and jokes on screen, the romantic fantasy is a much light hearted watch, of course not without its moment of bloody violence but at a lower volume. What may be hard for some audiences to get their head around, is this idea of an inter-species relations and with the astonishing design of the creature itself becomes something more than just a fish costume. The bond and sexuality of this romance is a significant thread to the film and is one that featured heavily with its repetitive moments of adult content. But what Del Toro explores its is real beauty in love and within the context of the film it does becomes something remarkable.<br/><br/>Sally Hawkins is exceptional in her vigorous performance as the mute Eliza, with dynamic sign language and spirited facial expressions, we see the isolated heart of the ""princess without voice"" which makes her connection to this solitary creature all the more real. Opposite her is the confident physical actor Doug Jones, manning the rubber suit of the creature in a brilliant bodily performance, outdoing his previous collaborative performances with Del Toro. Then Michael Shannon sensationally brings the real monster to the tale in Strickland, the dominating Colonel facing his battle in masculinity as well as with the creature. Shannon gives one of the best performances of his career, keeping with that classic fairy tale juxtaposition of man being the real monster.<br/><br/>As with all Del Toro's dark fantasies, it all becomes about the characters. Eliza reaching out to another like herself. Strickland trying to maintain his power and masculinity in his skirmish with the creature and Eliza. Hoffsetider being caught between to sides but seeking his own right, and Giles trying to find his significance back in society.<br/><br/>As never fails with a Del Toro films is the signature production design that brings to life these magnificent worlds. The Shape of Water although is not full Del Tory fairy tale land, does have a very extraordinary construct of the real world, from Eliza's apartment to the secret facility, echoing the true Gothic universe of the real world. Opening in a momentous title sequence, Del Toro literally floods the screen in ravishing visual effects and segments. Only more so combined with the inescapable talents of cinematographer: Dan Laustsen, swiftly moving from one room to the next in a mythical immersive experience alluring us furthermore into the depths of the story and art work of the film.<br/><br/>The Shape of Water is a wonderfully weird, quirky, heart-warming, extraordinary piece of cinema. For fans who have found Del Toro's previous works too dark or scary, will be delighted by this much more charming fantasy."

","I have no idea how this movie managed to get so many rave reviews. To me, it is just an unoriginal movie with one-dimensional characters. Both the setting (modern fairy tale set in hostile reality) and character design (specifically the merman) appear to have been recycled from Del Toro's previous movies ''Pan's labyrinth'' and ''Hellboy'', respectively. The characters' motivations and personalities were extremely one-note, just so they can serve the plot - one stereotypical example is 'the bad guy' (why is he acting the way he does? what is his motivation apart from wanting to appear manly and dominant? does he not have any redeeming qualities whatsoever (which would make him more believable)?). The love story seems to be a sort of a modern-day retelling of 'Beauty and the Beast', however, I did not feel any chemistry between the two lead characters. How did their relationship progress from her feeding him boiled eggs to a sexual and emotional connection? I can't help assuming this movie was supposed to be way longer but some inappropriate editing took out the scenes that would help us make sense of how this inter-species love story developed. The fact that we barely learn anything about the merman is not adding to him being a sympathetic character or facilitating an emotional involvement in the plot at all. I found myself not caring about this movie at all and I am surprised that critics have described it as 'heartfelt' and 'romantic'. I'd say, watch 'Pan's Labyrinth' instead."

"ElMaruecan82","7","4","5","4 July 2019"," And the Academy bit the bait...
","As a Best Picture winner, ""The Shape of Water"" is a most interesting choice, but I wonder if the Academy voted for the sci-fi spy thriller and its interspecies romance between the mute Eliza (Sally Hawkins) and the mysterious fish-man or the art-house movie channeling Jean-Pierre Jeunet and Alexandre Desplat whimsical Oscar-winning score à la ""Up"". I liked the content but there was something too bait-y on the surface to make me fully admire its merit.<br/><br/>Speaking of the Oscars, let me start with my first gut-reaction: I wish Michael Shannon was nominated instead of Richard Jenkins, he played the kind of villains that make the difference in a movie, I enjoyed every minute of his screen presence, as Head of Security Strickland, he was creepy, intimidating (he also made a terrific entrance) but there was something in his attitude that betrayed a deep, almost childish, desire to be a perfect citizen, a good soldier, who'd never disappoint his superiors... I figured he represented the infantilizing of American manhood through hardcore and blind patriotism, a way to show that no matter how strong and almighty men felt these days, they were still submissive.<br/><br/>Women are depicted as submissive but not as a choice, simply out of practicality in a still male-dominated America (those were the early 60s) but then they reveal themselves to be more dependable than men, it's interesting that the Octavia Spencer's character Zelda never betrays her friend, it's her husband, the guy who'd asked her to open the door who reveals himself as a coward. What I don't get though is whether Zelda was really going to let Strickland rip everything apart and not say a word, we'll never know, the film finds the perfect shortcut, the bad guy gets to Eliza but it's not Zelda's fault. It didn't make sense by the way that the husband wouldn't even let Zelda warn her friend... so I think the film had a little record to settle with men in general.<br/><br/>There are basically three good characters of male persuasion in the film: the fish-man, who's said to have everything at the right place though it doesn't look like he's got it, there's Jenkins' character Giles who's a misunderstood artist and attracted to men, which makes him twice an outcast and there's Michael Stuhlbarg's Hoffstetter, a good physician but trustworthy to a limit as his real name's Dimitri. It's interesting that the only three good men live in a sort of duplicity, deliberate or not, they're never what they claim to be and what they are inside, they're forced to hide it. Women are straight-forward but good men are driven into pretending to be what they're not, as if the reality of men was one of ugly nature. And when you have a film that handles an Alien species, it's comprehensible that ""Man"" belongs to the antagonistic side but women are certainly not part of that ""Man"" equation. Interesting.<br/><br/>One could even argue that Jenkins' character didn't want to help his friend Eliza first, until he realized how 'different' he was. In the scene where he gently pats the restaurant guy's hand and realizes that he crossed the line, you can see the young man making a 180° turn and going from a smiling guy to a dirty bigot, homophobic and much more racist since he tells the Black couple to get out, that's the reality of men, whether American or Russian, it doesn't make any difference. So obviously Del Toro is also putting a few baits for the feminist wave, and the janitor job is eloquent: it's literally the women who clean the men's ""dirty work"". Still, for all his efforts, he still got that comment from Portman when she nominated all the *male* directors in the Golden Globes ceremony, apparently, it didn't please Del Toro, but he should be good sport; If ""The Shape of Water"" tried to mix fantasy and sci-fi material with the current ""man vs. woman"" issues, it's only fair that these considerations interfered with the Awards race.<br/><br/>Now, did I like the film?<br/><br/>I liked Strickland because he drove the action, so yes, I liked the narrative. I thought the nomination of Jenkins was unnecessary but Octavia Spencer's was outrageous, I swear she plays the same role whenever she's nominated, and when your friend is a mute woman, it's not difficult to be a scene stealer, Sally Hawkins was impressive not much because of her silent performances but the way she dedicated herself to that role. Let's face it, she's not a natural beauty but she really made herself more beautiful than any other pretty face of Hollywood by being a gentle, nice and most of all, decent woman.<br/><br/>Now, my real problem is with Del Toro, no pun intended, I thought he was trying to swim in too many waters at the same time: he makes a beautiful romance and it works, a cat-and-mouse thriller, it works, but when the film gets too cutesy and poetic, I'm afraid he loses his guidance. As I mentioned it in the intro, yes, his film reminded me of Jeunet's world, from ""Delicatessen"" to ""Amelie"", yes, they give a specific texture to the universe of Eliza, old fashioned and kitschy looking, but a little less could have been more. What happened to Del Toro reminds me of Gilliam when he gets carried away by his own extravaganza... in ""The Shape of Water"", when Eliza gets naked in the water, it's simple, sensual and powerful... when she imagines the Broadway musical, it's just too much.<br/><br/>At the end, it's like Del Toro having the same childish desire to seek approbation from his peers that he tries to make an art-house movie out of what could have been a terrific thriller and a great romance. I didn't mind the ""social commentary"" aspect but for that, I found the ""Billboards"" film to be more powerful and more deserving of the Best Picture Oscar."

Sally Hawkins as Elisa Esposito, playing a mute in love with the creature, did a very good job. Michael Shannon, he just never disappoints. He's one of those actors that can play anything.

-Nope. Not ok with that.
And they showed it.
-Almost vomited in my seat.
And they showed a headless body. 
-Started crying and wondered who in their right mind puts this in a 'romance' story. So much for my date night.
Characters acted like it was nothing..even making jokes about it later on.
-How the heck are they ok with that? How are they not traumatized seeing a PET just gobbled up? I don't care if the guy said it's 'nature' And 'doing what's natural.' Nope. I would dry the creature up with a blow dryer and tell my neighbor she has bad taste in...whatever it is she's attracted to. Normal people don't let their lovers eat their pet cats. 
So yeah, after that it was just downhill. I kept thinking of ways the characters could avenge Pandora, the kitty, and was glad the crazy guy shot them. Even if they survived and he didn't, I gave a whoop in the audience. Love story? More like a nightmare because of unnecessary shock violence (I get voilence but not when it's overdone and has no meaning to the development of the plot, especially in a ROMANCE), stale characters with no development (How many times will Octavia play the same supporting role?), and random water fapping scenes."

","Excellent Actors. Borrowed Characters. Attempt at Fantasy Interspecies Romance. Good atmosphere. Unoriginal plot. Tries too hard to be PC and violates its own standards. Runs just over two hours. I give it a 4 out of 10. Your mileage may vary.<br/><br/>There are many characters and plot devices that are derived from other shows and movies. For instance, the Michael Shannon character Strickland is a reprise from his FBI agent character in Boardwalk Empire. Only here he is even more unlikable for reasons that are not really logical even within the context of the plot.
The theme of love between different beings with a magical tie-in is reminiscent of 'Avatar', along with the demonization of western 'white' mankind.
The 'creature' costume is very well done and very reminiscent of the similar creature in Hellboy. Hellboy was a much better integrated movie without the PC baggage.
The 'love' affair is of course nothing of the kind. It is, by the standards of the movie itself, an additional exploitation of an innocent creature by a human being."

If this had been made as a farcical B movie it might have been worth a ""well nothing better is on"" watch, but it's not. This movie actually takes it self seriously and expects us to do the same, despite a completely absurd premise couldn't be worse, and one which was horribly butchered to boot. We start with completely pointless nudity and shots of our star masterbating (that probably scored big points with the Hollywood crowd - no wonder it won awards), then we're introduced to a series of characters, none who are at all likable, believable, or even interesting, including an absurdly cliched Dr Evil type who wants nothing more than to kill/torture our poor Black Lagoon dude. We're given nothing even the tiniest bit believable in terms of how/why this girl falls in love with fishface, even for a movie. And, being Hollywood, they make sure to go out of their way to toss the race card in your face now and again (God forbid that be left out of a movie!), despite that having basically nothing to do with the movie (no doubt why it was places in the 60s). The script (at least early on) was like Don King's hairdo, frequently shooting off in haphazard, unrelated, and pointless ways. I could go on and on, but unlike the movie, I'll be merciful and stop there. But basically don't waste your time."

"gortx","Null","11","19","4 January 2018"," Adult fairy tale
","One of the most hauntingly erotic scenes of 50s cinema is the suggestive underwater pas de deux between Julie Adams and Ricou Browning (as the Gill Man) in CREATURE FROM THE BLACK LAGOON. Director Gillermo del Toro's THE SHAPE OF WATER was obviously inspired by that image when he conceived of his Adult Fairy Tale. And, adult it is, minutes in Sally Hawkins (Elisa) strips full frontal naked and masturbates in a bathtub. Message: Leave the kiddies at home.
Elisa works at a mysterious government facility where a creature from the Amazon has been taken. Credited as Amphibian Man (Doug Jones in a superb full body costume with some CGI touches), the creature is under the watchful eye of stern Richard (Michael Shannon), while also being experimented on by Dr. ""Bob"" Hoffstetler (Michael Stuhlbarg). Elisa is mute, and her only friends appear to be a co-worker Zelda (Octavia Spencer) and a lonely man in her building, Giles (Richard Jenkins). Elisa bonds with the Amphibian Man (think a distaff mermaid fantasy). When it becomes obvious to Elisa (and Dr. Hoffstetler) that the government has bad intentions for the monster, a conspiracy is hatched to save the beast.
In outline form, this all works very nicely. And, the Beauty and the Beast story-line is lyrically performed. Unfortunately, del Toro and co-writer Vanessa Taylor layer on a lot of layers - and, not all for the better. The movie is set in the early-60s in order to play off of Cold War tensions with the Russians. It gives the movie some obvious villains, and, setting it long ago adds to Elisa's fairy tale fate.<br/><br/>But, Shannon's Richard isn't just a tough security supervisor, but, a sexual deviant, bigot and a psychopath. Sure, in 1962 there was racism but, what does it really add to the movie to have a lunch counter scene (at one point Zelda is even referred to as ""The Help"" (I'm not kidding))? They toss in sexual prejudice and physical disabilities discrimination for good measure. Yes, the point is that Elisa, Zelda, ""Bob"" and Giles are outsiders, and therefore they are the only ones that can ""understand"" the monster. It's not so much the symbolism but the inelegance and heavy-handedness of how it's presented that is at issue here. Most crucially, it detracts from the core story.<br/><br/>Hawkins is a wonderful actress. The mute may be a bit of a cliche in these kinds of stories, but she gives it a soulfulness that is entrancing. Jenkins and Spencer are reliably sturdy, but, Stuhlbarg (also fine in the current CALL ME BY YOUR NAME) is quite exceptional presenting the duality of his role as ""Bob"". Shannon is one of our most commanding actors, but his part isn't written (or directed) with much finesse. He dominates the picture, rather than supports it. As noted, the makeup is excellent, and the other effects are subtle but effective. Alexander Splat's music is sweet, but, sometimes it doesn't gel with the harshness of the scenes it's played against. Dan Austen's photography is excellent.<br/><br/>THE SHAPE OF WATER is decent, but flawed. I have no particular issue with an R-Rated fantasy, but, here it doesn't seem necessary - or relevant. We've all seen more wholesome Beauty & The Beast/Mermaid stories before (astute genre viewers will also see homages to King Kong and other films). And, the essential base of the story with Elisa IS quite sweet. But, other than the frank nudity, all the other R-Rated elements are side points (cursing, gore and a gratuitous sex scene with Richard that only is there to highlight one particular fetish). Movies like UNDER THE SKIN and Almodovar's THE SKIN I LIVE IN were steeped in mature themes and imagery that were integral to their core, but, in SHAPE they seem extraneous. Hawkins and Amphibian Man make for a charming daydream, too bad its too often woken by interruptions."

","The Shape of Water is brilliantly directed by Guillermo del Toro and is set in the Cold War era of the 1960's. The U.S. Military has found a creature in the jungles of South America, an Amphibian Man (that looks a lot like the 1960's monster, The Creature From the Black Lagoon), and they want to use it as a military weapon against the Russians. The Russians want it too. That's the big picture the film hangs its hat on.<br/><br/>The deeper story is about Elsa (Sally Hawkins) and how her lonely life changes when she comes into contact with the ""secret experiment"" that the government is keeping in a military facility. She and her co- worker Zelda (Octavia Spencer) are part of the cleaning crew and it doesn't take long for them to discover that there's something different going on at the military facility.<br/><br/>It seems odd, but the movie is also a love story. Elsa sees the cruelty that the government's project head treats the amphibian man with (the sadistic head of the project is played by Michael Shannon) and she sneaks into his holding area at the facility to show him kindness and to show the amphibian man he's not all alone. <br/><br/>The theme of loneliness runs deep thru the movie. At home Elsa lives next door to an artist (Richard Jenkins) who's character is a gay man in the 1960's. They are both each other's only friend. The characters are all well developed and del Toro gives you a good insight into the lives they are all living. <br/><br/>Octavia Spencer is stellar in the movie. While Sally Hawkins character Elsa, who was born not being able to talk, is the main character, it's Spencer's character, Zelda, who keeps the movie moving along. <br/><br/>It seems odd but the interaction between Elsa and the monster is beautiful. It's a fairy tale love story like in Beauty and the Beast. However, the movie seems to go off the rails for about thirty minutes with a fantasy scene about a musical (the monster actually dances) and a few other scenes that would be a spoiler for the film. But overall the movie has way more good stuff than bad.<br/><br/>The Shape of Water is rated R for nudity and graphic violence and has a run time of 2 hours and 3 minutes. On my ""Hollywood Popcorn Scale"" I rate this movie a LARGE."

","""The Shape of Water"" in short: A mute woman has an unusual relationship with a strange creature captured in South America by the U.S. government.<br/><br/>It's the height of the cold war, circa 1950's, and tensions between communist U.S.S.R. and the U.S. are nearly equal to that of the competition between the two in the Space Race. Elisa and Zelda are janitors working the overnight shift at a top-secret government facility housing an amphibious creature that may give the U.S. a distinct advantage over the Soviets. Elisa, who is mute and communicates through sign language, forms an instant bond with the creature, who has an affinity, it seems, for hard boiled eggs. Zelda is Elisa's good friend, co-worker, and translator. The creature, however, needs no translator. It's an intelligent being.<br/><br/>Elisa spends her lunch hour in the lab communicating with the creature through sign. Witnessing these interactions is a scientist, Dr. Hoffstetler, charged with the creature's care. The man overseeing the entire secret government discovery is the creepy Richard Strickland, who reports to Five-Star General Hoyt. Strickland tries to convince his superior to mark the useless creature for death and dissection, a plan that doesn't sit well with Elisa and Hoffstetler. Hoyt has the power to make anyone disappear if he so chooses, a point that worries Strickland and influences his decisions later when all hell breaks loose.<br/><br/>Think of this movie as a cross between an R-rated ET (1982) meets an R-rated Splash (1984).<br/><br/>Two things you'll LIKE about ""The Shape of Water"": 1) It's hard to choose just two. The 13-Oscar nominations are well deserved. Everything flows nicely. Well-acted, designed, edited, directed, scripted, the list goes on. 2) Character actor Richard Jenkins (who is Oscar-nominated for Best Supporting Actor) plays Giles, a former alcoholic, current homosexual, down-on-his-luck advertising-agency-artist (whew) and is Elisa's friend and neighbor. He's awesome in this role and has one of the best line's in the movie (I won't spoil it).<br/><br/>Two things you'll DISLIKE: 1) If you're not a fan of Guillermo del Toro's unique style of film making, you will not like this movie. I am neither a fan nor a hater, but I still enjoyed the movie either way. 2) The subject matter. It's, uhm, odd (keep an open mind)."

","""This may very well be *the* most sensitive asset ever to be housed in this facility."" Fleming (David Hewlitt)<br/><br/>If you consider writer Guillermo del Toro's Pan's Labyrinth (2006), you might call him a visual genius, a poet who transcribes myth into reality. Now in his beautifully-written/directed The Shape of Water, when Elisa (Sally Hawkins) falls in love, it's with a fish, actually a large amphibian that can love her back, and the result is sweet.<br/><br/>That is until the government of early-sixties figures Amphibian Man a political liability and the lovers become fugitives. Undoubtedly inspired by The Creature from the Black Lagoon (1954), The Shape of Water is a lovely fantasy fable set in the Cold War, where a simple janitress, who is mute and an outsider like her Amphibian, struggles along with him to be accepted for the love she chooses.<br/><br/>I'm misleading you; the exciting struggle is mostly against the narrow-minded forces of convention and authority, which see the fish as a threat to national security, but just as much inscrutable and dangerous because of being misunderstood. <br/><br/>In that xenophobia lies the similarity to today's political climate which threatens our history of tolerance because of ignorance. Just as odd-looking foreigners threaten our way of life, so too does Amphibian Man, whose value as a specimen to be studied is compromised by foreign agents who do not wish us to benefit from research.<br/><br/>Strickland (Michael Shannon) is the weak authorities' security guy, who doggedly pursues Amphibian out of duty as much as ideology. His glee using an early version of a stun gun on the fish is a reminder of the rabid torture sanctioned by modern ""safety"" obsession.<br/><br/>Although I have made this film out to be a sci-fi political thriller, it is even more of a love story along the lines of a thinking-person's Beauty and the Beast, far more modern and human, possibly closer to Frankenstein, whose monster in the Mary Shelly novel is almost lovable in his ignorance and yearnings. <br/><br/>When Strickland seeks out to destroy the Amphibian and his love, he states the mantra of ill-considered radicals everywhere, even in politics: ""I deliver."" He could be Potus fulfilling a campaign promise or just plain evil. In either case, Beauty is always vulnerable and Beast, well, not meant for this ""civilized"" world."

","Although this movie has been a mediatic racket, I must say that they are more words than what the film really is, without a doubt Guillermo del Toro is not a bad director, but I think media and some nomination for some prices have made an ocean out of a glass of water.<br/><br/>The movie itself is not bad, it is somewhat slow, but had to be like that since it is more a romantic plot than nothing else, but it has good things of which we can talk.<br/><br/>Let's start asking ourselves: is it a movie to win the Oscar for the best movie?<br/><br/>the answer is a NO, and to give it would only confirm the little validity that the academy has to choose the winner, however I believe that this film deserves at least a nomination for photography, in terms of music, costumes, script, I do not think it deserves nomination since there was nothing special about these.<br/><br/>
Let's talk about photography, Possible oscar<br/><br/>The photography is based on a hard lighting, based on making the environment and the shapes stand out, giving them the greatest visual importance, and that is this film, a visual guide in a time not so past, where the black and white issues, where the sexual taste were taboos, which shows you a perspective of an impossible romance.<br/><br/>Takes in its development good camera angles, although in some shots I think it took more movements with dolly, that would have given a better reach to the scene, open shots predominate, always guiding the viewer as we mentioned earlier that this will enter more in the environment than in the history of a romance. Even the lighting that is the same from beginning to end fits perfectly in each shot.<br/><br/>So you should watch the movie, Yes, you would love it, depends , if u like romance drama yes, if your more into a interesting story, the answer is no."

(I was really disappointed, because a week ago I saw the equally ballyhooed ""Call Me By Your Name,"" which I also expected to love, but also hated.) Shannon gets the gold star for his performance, which was not hurt by having the best lines in the movie, and Jenkins shines in a multilayered role. But Sally Hawkins struck me as a mite too twee (and her ASL was sloppy) and Octovia Spencer was squandered in a role a nobody could have played. Del Toro's penchant for mixing nauseating gore into his films does not work here; this amphibious love story was ruined by all the violence and gore, which was used to much better effect in ""Pans Labyrinth,"" a film that was, after all, set amid the violence of Francoist Spain. The gore/violence factor made sitting through ""Shape"" for over two hours (too long for most movies) a chore, despite the lovely use of color and retro settings that made me recall my childhood.

"deedrefuhrman","5","6","9","7 February 2018"," Longer Version of the 2015 indie short ""The Space Between Us""
","The following is my opinion: Watch 'THE SPACE BETWEEN US"", a 2015 Indie short by: Marc S. Nollkaemper. Then decide if Guillermo del Toro stole this story. First of all, I want to mention that the Dutch filmmaker kindly shut down the growing talk of plagiarism but...It's still pretty Screamingly Obvious. And, it bothers me that Guillermo del Toro accepts the credit and financial gain from what is really, a story 
 written and directed by a STUDENT filmmaker. 
 ""The Space Between Us"" has haunted me since I watched it in 2015. And, when I saw the movie poster I initially thought ""The Shape of Water"" was a longer version. You'll notice the cover art for ""The Shape of Water"" is the final shot in the original film. When I realized they were made by different people, I began to look into other de Toro ""creations"". I found that the bulk of his successful work, i.e., everything from Hellboy, to Blade, to the Pale Man are based, and not loosely, on someone else's work. Comic books, novels, Victorian short stories, indie movies and Japanese mythology like Y'golonac and Tenome, to name some of his source material. Not an original idea in the bunch, just the addition of certain components and/or maybe a costume change.
 The original is more beautiful than del Toro's remake, because there's no unnecessary sex and violence. The addition of sex and violence was just the easy way to lengthen the movie. But, it shifted the focus from the lead characters shared oppression to a vaguely crass love story. Destroying some of the depth the story was intended to communicate and instead creating the chance to titillate the audience with intimacy between the leads and add violence in defence of their love. del Toro took the easy way when fleshing out the movie, as the genius was already there in the original storyline. 
 I think there's an obvious reason del Toro chose to ""create"" this movie, it fits his talent for taking a solid mature plot and/or character(s) and repackaging them for public consumption. A very useful talent and, admirable if you acknowledge that's what you're doing. del Toro has a reputation for creating original works, which I believe, hasn't been fairly earned. Rebranding an existing creation to develop marketability and pump up a bottom line, are far different talents versus originating something new that prior to you, didn't exist in ANY form. Frankly, in the case of this movie, it's the classic story of a young student having their work stolen by an older person with cash and reputation. This particular student has been smart enough not to fight a very expensive uphill battle but, is spinning it into something positive for his career. Another testament to Marc S. Nollkaemper's brilliance.
 Bottom line, moving forward I'll search out anything Marc S. Nollkaemper is involved with, as he obviously has the potential to become a major talent. And, I'll avoid anything connected to Guillermo del Toro because I no longer trust that the work is genuinely his. I can't support this type of blatant theft of another artist's ideas as it's already tough enough for an artist to hold onto to intellectual property in today's world. Lastly, I know there are those who will still say, there's no relationship between the films...Just watch them both in the order they were released, the truth is pretty straightforward."
"heatherly-60900","6","6","9","26 January 2018"," Water and Sex DO NOT Mix....
","This movie was so gorgeously filmed; I loved the beauty aspect of it. Where it lacked was in the romance between woman and fish-man. I so wanted to feel some sense of emotion for this ""couple."" First of all it's a man's fantasy. The woman is naked in much of the film and masturbates every morning in her bathtub. <br/><br/>I can feel empathy for the fish creature. I would want to save him myself. But I would not find him desirable as a romantic interest. He didn't really communicate to any more depth or level that a signing Ape. Would I want to have sex with an Ape? Uh... just NO! <br/><br/>This may be a delicate subject but it's the ENTIRE PREMISE OF THE MOVIE. So, anyone should know that sex and water do not mix -- no matter what shape it is! Hah! I could go on and on any on... but it is a cardinal rule. Just look it up on line. I won't go into the details but it's just not something that I, as a woman, would enjoy in the water.

","The Shape of Water is not a bad film and definitely does not deserve to be ignored but it is not that good either. Something is simply missing. Guillermo del Toro, Sally Hawkins, Michael Shannon, Octavia Spencer and Richard Jenkins are all masters at their work and deserve all the respect. Direction is good and photography lush. The story itself however, is a romantic fairytale and does not go very deep, it could move and affect the viewers much more if done differently, the characters are pretty one-dimensional, we have the good girl, funny friend, another old funny friend and the villain. Throughout the film the story is trying to present many social issues and even though the film is set in the 1950's, many of the issues are still reflected in our society today. We have racism, sexism but the main thing that the film is trying to tell us is that it is important to accept and love anyone who is good, no matter how different they are. It is a beautiful message but it all feels a bit to forced, it could have been more subtle. The main problem is that the entire film feels like a big Oscar bait. It seems to have worked quite well. Another thing about the Oscar nominations, Michael Shannon should not have been left out. All performances are good but his especially stands out. Could have been really good and it is a shame since there is so much talent involved in the film."

What it so romantic about a woman who masturbates excessively in her bath tub, before going to work, while she boils her eggs? Or about a man who is brutally having sex with his wife, covering her mouth with his bloody hand when she wants to speak? Or about a man-fish creature who is tortured with electric shocks when he's in chains? Or when the same creature decapitates a cat and eats the head? Or when a woman picks two chopped fingers on the floor and put it on a lunch paper bag, and the same fingers turn violet/black and are plucked from the hand? And, of course, the violence, the shootings, the dirty talk and the blood. A LOT OF BLOOD! If all these things are romantic, then Jane Austen is a sci-fi novelist...<br/><br/>However, the soundtrack is nice, some images and the retro atmosphere of the 60's are interesting, but the script has big gaps.

","This film's subject matter of inter-species/culture communication/romance have been compared to ""E.T."", ""King Kong"", Starman"" and ""Beauty and the beast"". The one comparison struck me most, however, I have not seen mentioned anywhere: Cocoon. Here we have human interaction with a benevolent extraterritorial species that has special power of healing and rejuvenation, almost god-like. At the end of ""The shape of water"", a character said to the amphibian man ""you ARE a god"" (preceded by an unprintable exclamation in four letters). <br/><br/>The film opens with VO of one of the key support characters and an eerie (in a mesmerizingly beautiful way) image of the protagonist underwater, tantalizingly unclear whether dead or alive. The narrative then plunges right into the repetitive daily life of Elisa (Sally Hawkins), a mute (but not deaf) cleaning woman: gets up, prepares hard-boiled egg, fills bathtub then immerses herself and masturbates (with foreshadowing not yet understood by the audience). Working in a state-owned top scientific research outfit in Baltimore in the 60s, Elisa is in the lowest layer of the social structure, due to her handicap as well as her deprived childhood. Her view of herself is, sadly, summed up in one word: incomplete. She has meaningful communication with only two people, both minorities and therefore targets of bigotry: a black co-worker Zelda (Octavia Spencer) and elderly gay neighbor Giles (Richard Jenkins). <br/><br/>Elisa's mundane existence is disturbed by the arrival of a critical top-secret project. First, it is the typical WASP project leader who now takes charge of the institute. Richard Strickland (Michael Shannon) advertises his bigotry not with common abrasive language but in subtler way. In a conversation with Zelda on how ridiculous it is that Amazon natives worship the amphibian man like a god, he reflects that a god would perhaps look like himself, ""maybe even like you, but a little more like me, I guess"".<br/><br/>Yes, the project is the amphibian man. Regardless of whether a god should look like him, he is clearly modelled after the iconic Creature of the Black Lagoon. Situation-wise, he is very much like Caesar in The Planet of the Apes re-boot, a subject of human's ruthless experiment. While Andy Serkis's Caesar is motion-captured, Doug Jones plays the amphibian man in flesh and blood. If you want a comparison, there is a very good one, Karl Urban playing the deadly cop called Dredd, in the movie with that same title - the entire face under a mask, exposing only his mouth. <br/><br/>Once you have accepted the basic premise, the rescue plot is all but natural. This is now the ""E.T."" trajectory: the government threatening the life of the subject experimented on and the ""little people"" team up in a miraculous rescue mission. The Russian spies that want to kill him before the U.S. learns anything from the experiment are thrown in just to spice up the plot a little. The interspecies romance, so beautifully depicted, is the forte of this film. The aforementioned ""Cocoon"" aspect serves nicely to conclude this fairytale.<br/><br/>Sally Hawkins, even in this near tragic role of Elisa, retains some of the irrepressible cheerfulness seen in her Golden Globe winner (Comedy or Musical category) of best actress in ""Happy-go-lucky"". While life is more of a mere existence rather than living, Elisa's indomitable spirits sores when she is enjoying her music, which occasionally moves her to try a few Astaire-Roger type of dance steps, sometimes even in synchronization Giles, both sitting on a sofa. The love for music plays a large part in the bonding in the interspecies romance with the amphibian man. <br/><br/>In 1949, Jane Wyman won an Oscar by portraying a deaf-mute in ""Johnny Belinda"". While Hawkins is recognized to have a shot this year, Frances McDormand is just too strong a competition."

","The Shape of Water, which has an excellent acting quality, is not great, but is a fast-paced, not boring, good movie. The photography is not impressive, special effects are not excellent, neither is makeup, costumes or the plot, just as it does not introduce novel cinematographic elements. In addition, Del Toro repeats himself in the concept he used in Pan's Labyrinth, which by the way, is an excellent film in all its elements. Now, although the film is not particularly sentimental and for some it might be creepy to think of a human copulating with an amphibian, its real value lies in its ability to give voice and visibility to those who are invisible in our society. There is much talk, for example, of the rights of gay people, but there is no talk of the immense loneliness they are subjected to, especially when they reach a certain age or stage of life. Little is said about the loneliness, isolation and rejection experienced by people with disabilities or those who do not conform to socially established stereotypes. Elisa, Giles and the creature itself - of which we never knew its origin, or its species, or its story - personify the most painful of all solitudes, the one that is experienced even when surrounded by others. The Shape of Water provides us with a glimpse into the lives of these beings who go through life surviving instead of living, with the ever weaker hope of finally being seen by someone. It is worth watching this movie with a reflective spirit."

","Shape of Water is a period-piece of adult fairy tale romance with magical realism. Placed in Cold War 1960s, the movie tells the story of a mute cleaner at a government facility who falls in love with a captured fish-man being held for research. They escape, fall in love and have to avoid being caught by the government agent overseeing the operation.<br/><br/>It's a slow and familiar tale for most of the story. I wasn't overly captivated and would definitely see this movie as more of a piece of artsty, oscar, festival worthy cinema-making than an exciting or fun movie. Obviously, the talented director and cast intended to make it that way, leading to their Oscar win. All the acting is very high quality and the directing shows an incredible attention to detail. A few twists help make the ending more exciting. However, the bad guy lacks depth, the good guys lack any bad-side and the story drags and feels familiar at times. However, I'm glad I saw it and have to respect what it accomplished - although I won't be rushing to re-watch."

","Ugh...here we go again. I felt like I was being accosted by the overeager theme, all the while hoping for some romantic subtlety.<br/><br/>As long as you don't indulge yourself in the expectation of any surprises in the plot or intricacy in the theme, it is entertaining. There is no small amount of effort trying to make a film of quality here, but being better than 80% is still pretty mediocre. The visuals are stunning. I also want to give full credit to whoever was in charge of casting. The ensemble and execution were very appealing and that alone is worth the watch. I know it is a rehash character, but I just can't look away from Octavia Spencer (Elisa's friend Zelda) and found myself looking forward to her lines. I am a sucker for Richard Jenkins in just about anything, but particularly when he wears his weakness like a crown. There is a certain frailness he is able to channel at will that is magnificent. You can easily picture his character (in scenes never filmed) alone in a room at night muttering ""How did I ever end up like this?""<br/><br/>Also, the convenient setting of 1962 does not excuse the tired caricature of straight white men. My gas tank is running low on collective guilt for the horrors of suburbia, and I wonder who is left to convince on this one? Aren't we all now singing a harmonious rendition of the hit song, ""Men (mostly white & straight) are Deplorable and Care Nothing for Love""? I'll check my white privilege as I am sure that even calling out this ridiculous stereotype is going to have me called a racist by someone.<br/><br/>I will concede that this film will be absolutely adored by a segment of the viewers, even the ridiculous dance scene. Go ahead and watch it on the slim chance that you may be one of those people. It really wasn't that far off, but in the end, it will fade away like so many other best picture winners that lack any sort of timeless quality."

I certainly don't understand why the sex with a monster was even written in the screenplay other than to try to say sex with different species of animals is groovy? The Shape of Water just came across as pushy, full of itself and a little weird, in a bad way. I guess this films not-to-subtile undertones skip hand-in-hand with Hollywood's modern mantra."
"katharineshowalter","4","11","20","29 January 2018"," Very Watery Fairy Tale
","As with any Guillermo del Toro movie, ""The Shape of Water"" looks gorgeous, and the rest is competently done, if not very interesting or original. I have always loved Sally Hawkins in anything she does, and she's very good here in the put-upon Cinderella role. But other than that, I can't describe this movie as anything more than pleasant. Doug Jones as the Creature doesn't get much screen time. Torture. Egg-eating. Glowy sex. That's about all he's allowed to do here. For all we know, he's manipulating Sally's character into freeing him. We learn next to nothing about him and spend no time in his POV. Richard Jenkins is fine as a sad aging gay stereotype. Michael Shannon brings bizarrely unnecessary nuance to a role that, in the end, is nothing more than the hothead bureaucrat we've seen a million times; the nuance goes nowhere. Octavia Spencer does just as expected, nothing special. Overall, this might as well be a Disney movie -- except for the nudity and sex, which are fine but which seem incongruous in a movie that otherwise, in terms of plot and theme, is nothing more than a children's fairy tale. You've seen this all many times before. The special healing powers of the Creature are also very old hat by now. And the ending is telegraphed leagues away."

The Russians want to kill it so that the Americans can't study it. And the lonely mute cleaning woman wants to have sex with it. I don't know how it ended, because I had no interest in the outcome of such a silly, twisted fable. I shut it down and went to bed. I have always been a great admirer of Guillermo del Toro's films-until now. What's the message here? Are there no limits on what we can have sex with? Does sexual fulfillment trump all ideas of decency? Is this the best our culture can do in defining a meaning for our lives?

","In this Cold War era top-secret US facility, a lonely, mute janitor (Sally Hawkins) unexpectedly finds compassion and connection with an amphibious creature being held captive. After further curiosity, she forms a unique relationship with the creature.<br/><br/>Guillermo del Toro has made a knack for himself as a director of bringing his b-movie monster filled fantastical imagination to the adult landscape, The Shape of Water is no different as del Toro returns to form, stitching together this lovingly sweet and twisted romance. What is strikingly prominent above all else in the case of The Shape of Water and del Toro's other work is his authentic genius, a word that sounds clichéd when talking of a director of a certain calibre, however, evidently in The Shape of Water del Toro's detail orientation and particular vision for his film is unmatched in its execution.<br/><br/>More than most other films, you will find yourself noticing the production and stage design, its meticulous and striking character does wonders in the world building of the film. The familiar cinematic landscape of 1960s America is suddenly otherworldly and hauntingly beautiful, aided by the vividly distinct cinematography that feels as warm yet itching as the film's narrative. Which is a wholeheartedly original, moving, appropriately twisted adult fairytale. It's remarkable that del Toro can connect an audience to a relationship between a mute and a fish, but what really drives this home is the astonishing performance from lead Sally Hawkins, it's truly inspiring to see just how much she is able to convey and tell an audience through no words at all.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast members hold up this level of finesse with strong performances of their own, in particular, is Richard Jenkins and his character of the gay neighbour, but what sets this character out above the others is that he is given this eloquent side plot, it's unfortunate that the same level of eloquence was not given to the Michael Shannon's character's side plot. Which bogs down the middle act of the film and distracts from the main narrative, it does however, do a decent job to undo the demonization of the character and add to the theme of the film of having an empty part in your life. Sadly though it subtracts from the overall pacing and plotting of the film and leaves a little to be desired in terms of character development.<br/><br/>Despite this, The Shape of Water is downright breathtaking, from its masterful soundtrack, striking performances and its twisted, sweeping, comedic and charismatic storytelling. It does all it can to remind you of the magical experience that is cinema, painstakingly detailed direction and cinematography highlights the unconditional creativity from Guillermo del Toro, who has truly outdone himself with this outlandish romance that is sure to dazzle."

"Samiam3","5","6","10","10 June 2018"," the water is shallow
","Sketchy is the first word that comes to my after seeing Del Toro's the Shape of Water; a film of crude story telling, gimmicky characters, and obvious direction.
How on earth did this win over the Academy.<br/><br/>This rendition of the beauty and the beast tale, pairs a mute janitor with a captive swamp monster. Bathed in an oversaturated color palette, the movie looks and plays like a comic book where the characters have no free will and are mostly representational, including the bible thumping villain, who (for no needed reason) also makes a perverted sexual move on our protagonist. <br/><br/>Del Toro's decision to make the heroine mute is so that she can learn to communicate with the creature via sign language. If you stop to think about it , you don't need to be speechless in order to communicate with hand gestures. Just imagine all the things that Eliza would say to the creature if she could speak, Maybe she could even make a couple of jokes, which would be a blessing to this rather humourless enterprise. There is a greater feeling that Eliza is made mute. cause she needs to be vulnerable and sympathetic. <br/><br/>The romantic relationship feels rushed and has no shape, in fact the whole movie feels a good half hour shorter than it should be. It's possible that Del Toro came under studio pressure to fit the story into two hours, but as a result, certain important devices like Eliza's strange sexual fetish are barely illuminated.<br/><br/>It is bewildering that a del Toro movie could have a creature as boring as this one. The texture is there, but the character is not. Bland in personality and largely inanimate, his primary function is to be a love interest, in a love story that is hard to relate to. Admirable set decoration is the only highlight of the movie."

"antoniatejedabarros","6","5","8","20 February 2018"," The Shape of Water. The Shape of Violence?
","Sex and violence really sell, don't they? A bit of porn, lots and lots of violence and you have a multi Academy Award nomination movie!<br/><br/>I went to see yesterday The Shape of Water and I was highly disappointed. While the music, the cinematography and the performances are amazing, the love story is really not convincing and a bit creepy, and the unnecessary sex scenes (masturbation and coitus) and, specially, the monstruos violence killed all the poetry of the movie. In the same way that I don't think a director needs to show the actors shitting, pissing or picking their noses I find graphic sex a very poor choice for a director to illustrate a point. But, more than that, I find violence onscreen really disturbing and I think that such a high degree of violence is a very poor tool for a director. An exception to that would probably be Tarantino, who uses violence in such a crude way that it ends out being funny (nevertheless, Tarantino's violence is sometimes too much for me, even when he uses it for something great, like killing Nazis). I think that there are greater cinematic ways of showing violence than graphic torture, flying fingers, and litres of blood. If you don't agree with me, go and see Doctor Zhivago: you will be amazed by the power of the scene where the Imperial Army is massacring the people next to the Winter Palace and all you can see is the horrifying face of Doctor Zhivago, who, from a safe window, watches men, women, and children being slaughtered by the Imperial Army. Now, that's art. The rest is only good special effects and a big lack of imagination. The same goes for sex. There are many ways of showing the act of love with sensuality, strength, and poetry, but Guillermo del Toro chose here graphic sex. Why? I guess it sells better.<br/><br/>Frankly, I don't get the hype around this film. 13 Academy Award nominations? Come on! Guillermo del Toro looks like a really nice guy, and I actually hate to write negative reviews. If I spend a bit of time in writing this negative review it's because, as with La La Land (an annoying and cheesy torture filled with cliches), I'm amazed at how bad or not so good Hollywood movies can get such a hype, while other movies, like Woody Allen's masterpieces, get shut out and don't get any important nominations (yes, I am a huge fan of Woody: I love his art, his philosophy and his genius, and I'm very angry at this wave of hypocrisy, opportunism and lies around him that mixes false accusations from two crazy and resentful women with the most beautiful art).<br/><br/>The characters of The Shape of Water are all either black or white, there are no greys here: the bad ones are really bad and the good ones are really good. Well, life isn't neither black nor white. It's full of greys. While the performances are all amazing: Sally Hawkins is great, Octavia Spencer is amazing as always, Richard Jenkins is really good too and Michael Shannon is stunning (he really steals the movie and, surprisingly, didn't get any Golden Globe or Academy Award nomination), the souls of the characters are painted only in one color, and that's very Hollywood-ish and commercial. <br/><br/>Also, I wonder, for which age is The Shape of Water? You would first think that a fantasy movie is suitable for children, but this one is not. Or, you would think that a love story with so much violence and a bit of porn is suitable for adults, but then, why put this stupid fish-creature? I'm used to seeing lots of fantasy and children movies with my kids (ages 11, 9 and 4, so, imagine: I've seen them all: since The Dark Cristal from 1982 until the last superhero movie). But this movie, for who is it?<br/><br/>I understand why this movie can arrive to people, especially people who feel very lonely. I feel a great deal of empathy for all the people who feel alone in the world and seek love and company wherever they can, but I think that the black and white characters and the huge degree of violence kill the depth of this movie. Maybe the majority of the people of today are so used to see violence (on TV and on the internet) that they don't even notice it any more. I am very sensible to violence and it disturbs me a lot when I see it (here at home we don't have a TV for many many years, so I really don't know what's going on with TV violence these days -we only choose what we want to watch and watch it with our cinema projector). I understand that there are movies where violence is necessary (for instance, if you watch a movie about the Holocaust it may contain some graphic violence) but what really bothers me, artistically speaking, is superfluos violence: violence for selling, for entertaining a bit more and keep the audience amused. That kind of violence is repulsive.<br/><br/>I don't like to put a qualification for a movie. I always found it pretentious of us, the audience and the reviewers, to qualify the huge work of a director with a number (I'm aware of the fact that to create art is difficult and to criticize is easy). But this time, since there is such a hype around this film, I feel obliged to qualify this movie. So, 1 point for the music (Alexandre Desplat), 1 point for the cinematography (Dan Laustsen), 1 point for Michael Shannon, 1 point for Sally Hawkins, 1 point for the amazing Octavia Spencer, and 1 point for Richard Jenkins. 6/10<br/><br/>If you want to listen to good music, be amazed by a beautiful cinematography, see Sally Hawkins's sexual part, enjoy your popcorn while a fish-creature is being tortured in a brutal way, blood is running, and a cats loses her heads, go and see The Shape of Water."
"realfandangoforever","7","5","8","3 February 2018"," The Monster
","Though this film contains many commendable traits, eg. special effects and some characters, I found myself impatient and wanting the pace to pick up. Elisa (Sally Hawkins), Giles (Richard Jenkins) and Zelda (Octavia Spencer ) were all great. The Monster, no, not that monster; Richard Strickland (Michael Shannon) was masterful and the new, teal, Cadillac paralleled his character perfectly. And, between the violence, this love story had me laughing a few times. Nostalgic. Worth your time but don't consume caffeine before or during."
"Red_Identity","Null","5","8","23 December 2017"," Beautiful, yet disappointing.
","I agree with the few here who have said that The Shape of Water is good, even very good, but somehow it doesn't reach greatness. Although I can pinpoint why that is. The film is very well directed, but it's working with a screenplay that is perhaps simplistic and dare I say it, pedestrian. The film should have been anything but unremarkable, but that's how so much of it felt. The romance at its core was too quickly developed for my liking, causing it to feel like the film was just going through the motions instead of stopping to let us bask in its magic. In addition to being very unremarkable, the screenplay is also filled with some questionable storylines and some unimpressive, if even dry dialogue. Visually it's on point, although I would disagree that the film's cinematography is anywhere near that of something like Blade Runner 2049, which is unfortunate because it could very well win that Oscar. The score is also very nice, although again it should have been so much more memorable. The acting is definitely the best part of it. Sally Hawkins is luminous, and although I'm not sure I would rank her as being better than McDormand and Ronan (for Three Billboards and Lady Bird respectively, all three vying for the Oscar) it's an impressive performance that is deeply heartfelt. The other biggest surprise is Richard Jenkins, who lights up every scene he is in. Stuhlbarg is fine, and Shannon is disappointing. The latter is such a talented actor, but he can only do so much with such a one-note character (again, the screenplay's fault).<br/><br/>Overall, it's worth it but in a pool of much more impressive award contenders like Lady Bird, Call Me By Your Name, and The Florida Project, it's a film that could have been so much more."

Sally Hawkins gives a stellar central performance, as does the rest of the cast; the score and featured music are lovely, adding tons to the general tone and feel. But the story. It has its heart in the right place, but as much as I love the creative idea, there's no getting around it: it doesn't work as well as I'd hoped. Yes, it's predictable, but what really hampers the affect is that I just don't buy the love between girl and fish-man. That's a problem because it's the centrepiece, the main attraction. There seems to be some essential elements missing to make it believable. So whilst it's touching, in a sense, and an enjoyable visual feast with a hint of magic, 'The Shape of Water' just doesn't soar to the heights it could have"

","The Shape of Water
(2017)
Dir: Guillermo Del Toro<br/><br/>Okay so considering this film won ""Best Picture"" I needed to see what the hype was about for myself. Now Del Toro is notorious for creative wonderful worlds and unique stories with fantastic creatures in his films. The only complaint I have about this creature, is that it is eerily similar to Abe from ""Hellboy"" same actor same director but different character. The story telling was amazingly done and I enjoyed every minute of the film. Michael Shannon once again proves that he is amazing at playing a villain. I thought it was great that the creature was mostly practical effects (a guy in a suit) rather than depending solely on CGI. The ending was kind of expected, and there are a handful of cringeworthy scenes. Nothing is really held back in the sense of it being a film that is straight forward. The rewatch ability depends on wether I want to show the film to someone. Other than that I don't really think I would rewatch on my own. I can certainly see why it won best picture given the style and art of the film. Although I haven't seen the other films except for ""Get Out"".<br/><br/>4/5 solid. No more and no less."

","The Faberge Egg: A thing of undoubted beauty, extremely costly but serving no real purpose.<br/><br/>So it is with The Shape of Water.<br/><br/>Constantly Guillermo del Toro leaves me disappointed. Pan's Labrynth especially and now this much hyped 'masterpiece'. Both miss the target by some distance for me. (I'll give you, he nailed it in both Cronos - a long time ago now - and Hellboy.)<br/><br/>There's much to like about The Shape of Water (but NOT the music which is standard fare and I'm puzzled as to why it won the BAFTA). The design is superb, it really is a sumptuous feast both in period detail, cinematography and mood and the sets are great.<br/><br/>Sally Hawkins is fine in the role of a mute who falls in love with a fishy 'monster' but why, oh why, does she need to get full frontal naked and masturbate in her bath in the opening scenes of the movie. Wholly gratuitous.<br/><br/>Octavia Spencer puts in a decent shift in the supporting female role but, oh my gosh, this is not an Oscar-worthy performance. (Exactly the same can be said about the mystifying nomination for Mary J. Blige in Mudbound - I'll leave you to your own conclusions on why these were Academy nominated.)<br/><br/>Both the male leads are on form; Michael Shannon as the nasty finder and torturer of the fish man and Richard Jenkins as Hawkins' neighbourly friend and the narrator; an alcoholic, cat-loving, adman fallen on hard times.<br/><br/>My biggest criticism lies with the script, or more correctly, the plot which has holes the size of the budget (actually, on checking it was only $19.4m, so my Faberge analogy is stretched a little. Author's note: Faberge Eggs sell from around $6m to $33m.)<br/><br/>OK it's a fantasy movie but it's pretty silly really and stretches credibility throughout.<br/><br/>I wanted to like this, I really did and I don't dislike it, it's just so fundamentally flawed that its 13 Oscar nods verge on ludicrous. I don't think it will take home more than three (I wouldn't give it any with a possible exception for design) - Best Movie most certainly should not be one of them."
"rockman182","7","12","25","2 December 2017"," The Shape of Water (2017)
","Guilermo del Toro is a solid filmmaker. I'm not overly crazy about his work and don't rate him as highly as many others do, but the visual beauty of his films cannot be denied. I am not crazy about Pans Labyrinth or Pacific Rim but I do actually love Crimson Peak. I was always going to check out The Shape of Water to see if Toro could follow up Crimson Peak with an equally outstanding piece of cinema. While The Shape of Water isn't amazing its quite enjoyable.<br/><br/>The film takes place in the 1960's where a mute cleaning women finds a creature has been captured by a Colonel and starts bonding with this otherwordly creature. She attempts to free the creature and falls in love along the way. On the other hand, the Colonel is an aggressive man and is abusive towards the creature and then goes all out to try to figure out who helped the creature escape. The film is set with a back drop of U.S./Soviet tensions and plays a part in minor aspects of the film.<br/><br/>This is definitely the best Sally Hawkins performance to date. She is wonderful as a mousy mute woman and does so much terrific acting in the absence of words. Michael Shannon was just born to play a villain and pulls off a typically good Michael Shannon performance. While this film isn't as visually stunning as some of del Torro's other work, the creature design, camera work, and costume and set design is still very top notch.<br/><br/>I'd say one thing about Del Torro's film that could be a criticism is the writing. The film is fairly predictable. Its good, but goes down a route that we've seen in similar type of films. Its an entertaining film but its not anything jaw dropping visually or creatively. Strong performances and del Torro's imaginative creature creation keeps the film moving and he creates characters you want to root for. Its not del Torro's best but its definitely going to please his die hard fans.<br/><br/>7.5/10"

","It is original. I will give it that. It is beautifully shot. But it's also just very strange. I like movies that have a fairy tale feel to them (as this one did), but I never felt a deep connection between the heroine and the water creature. It was kind of creepy for a ""romance."""
"BestBenedikt","6","4","6","23 May 2019"," A visually impressive, but ultimately formulaic and bland film
","Having finally seen this film now, I do find it to be vastly overrated, while at the same time it became perfectly clear why this won the Best Picture award last year, as it comes off as typical Oscar bait.<br/><br/>THE SHAPE OF WATER is basically the quintessential del Toro film - beautiful on the outside and crafted with great attention to visual detail, but shallow and formulaic in terms of substance. It's a fairy tale, a narrative consistently painted in black and white with its empowerment of all possible sorts of minorities in a conservative 1950s setting.<br/><br/>My biggest problem with the film was its lack of real emotion. The whole romance felt clumsy and unbelievable. While it might have been plausible for the female protagonist to save this merman from certain death, them falling in love was just forced. A mute woman, scared of most men, suddenly offers herself to a humanoid fish? And her work colleague doesn't think that's weird at all? These offputting scenes did nothing for me except for making me feel uncomfortable.<br/><br/>Again, just like with CRIMSON PEAK, del Toro made a good looking, yet strangely unemotional feeling film - they also both share scenes with explicit violence that kind of interfere with the narrative's tone. Some directors seem to struggle with conveying palpably emotion in their films, and besides Christopher Nolan, del Toro appears to be one of them."

","I must admit that I was surprised to learn that this film won 4 Oscars, though I'm just as surprised by the many negative 1 and 2 star reviews that it has received. In terms of ideas and creativity, 'The Shape of Water' is as good as any film I've seen in the last few years. With a storyline as inventive and unique as this one, it makes for a fascinating couple of hours of viewing and, if you like films that take risks and dare to be different, there is a lot to enjoy about it.<br/><br/>For all its ideas and creativity, however, 'The Shape of Water' is lacking in some areas and can make for frustrating viewing at times. The storyline is underdeveloped in areas, particularly towards the end where there are many unanswered questions and the ending itself is a little underwhelming. That said, 'The Shape of Water' deserves credit for injecting fresh ideas into the fantasy romance genre. It might not be worth 4 Oscars, but 'The Shape of Water' is a unique and captivating film."
"WubsTheFadger","7","4","6","7 May 2018"," The Shape of Water
","Short and Simple Review by WubsTheFadger<br/><br/>The Shape of Water tells a tale of two unlikely lovers. The story is interesting and engaging. Guillermo del Toro is a masterful storyteller. I just feel that the critical acclaim for this film set the bar way to high. I did not see it as a masterpiece, nor should it have won the Oscar for Best Picture. It is a good film with great visuals. The social message shown throughout the film is a little cliché (Love can be between anyone). But I did enjoy the ending.<br/><br/>The acting is very good. Michael Shannon performs the best in my eyes as a man who never fails. Richard Jenkins, Octavia Spencer, Michael Stuhlbarg, and Doug Jones all perform very well also. Sally Hawkins does a very good job portraying her characters. She is also shown completely nude in this film which is great (Her breasts and pubic hair can be seen).<br/><br/>The pacing starts off fast but it slows down in the middle. The runtime is also overlong.<br/><br/>The music used throughout the film is great and the set pieces and props make it feel like the 1960s.<br/><br/>Pros: Original and interesting story, good storytelling, great visuals, very good acting by Michael Shannon, good overall acting, seeing Sally Hawkins completely nude, and a great use of music and props<br/><br/>Cons: Some slow pacing, an overlong runtime, a cliché social message, and the movie was not as spectacular as the critics made it out to be<br/><br/>Overall Rating: 7.2<br/><br/>P.S. I truly don't believe this film deserved Best Picture. Films like Blade Runner 2046, Dunkirk, Three Billboards, and Phantom Thread were a lot better then this film."
"xianhasan","5","4","6","2 March 2018"," Is it really that good?
","A love story between two worlds, two completely different life forms,The Shape of Water(2017).<br/><br/>There are two types of people for this movie, either you will completely love it or you will completely hate it. If you have patience enough to read my review, you will know on which type I stand my ground.<br/><br/>Basically, it's all about bestiality cause any creature you want have sex with except for human is called bestiality. A mute girl stealing confidential GOVT research subject from a facility with ease, little to no effort, it IS really hard to believe where everyone has access to this place, including low class cleaners.<br/><br/>Story didn't work for me for single moment. A secret research subject that can change the universe or wars between two countries or other important things, since 5 star military personnel were assigned to it and secret agents were involved, things didn't blend at all, specially with the subject importance and easy-peasy lemon-squeezy type of security system. Now you may ask, why was there a secret tunnel behind research subject that leads to all the way to loading dock? Anyone can secretly get in to that tunnel and spy on the researches?! Also why wasn't a single piece of surveillance camera in that long tunnel where as surveillance cameras are seen everywhere except for in woman's locker room? When they brought in the amphibious creature to their apartment, no one noticed it? Also when that creature ran away, also no one noticed it? <br/><br/>There was no effort to find that creature also. Story fell flat here. Either they show Richard Strickland (played by Michael Shannon) in his home or looking at his fingers pushing pus out of this dead fingers or smelling it. A 5 star military person is assigned to this research and ordering some guy with no backup or support to find this creature is beyond laughable.<br/><br/>Also they have readable key-cards to enter in the facility office but simple paper made id card (anyone can fake it if they want) that gets verified by guards to enter in the building that leads to loading dock directly, where anyone can enter the facility through that tunnel without having any readable key-cards? Are you kidding me?<br/><br/>There were many fine moments in this movie but since I didn't like this movie, focused on cons only.<br/><br/>Sorry but I didn't buy its story at all. There were a lot of plot holes, errors from technical to direction and lastly, whole story was faulty at some point. I don't mind watching fictional movies or reading them but one must have to make it believable.<br/><br/>Sex and masturbation scenes were completely unimportant and unnecessary. Also Giles (played by Richard Jenkins) as a Gay man was completely unnecessary. This didn't put a single change or affected the story except for empowering LGBTQ movements in real life, which is nice but not for a movie where director don't know how to use that as a element for the story.<br/><br/>Story : 5/10
Acting : 6/10
Cinematography : 6.5/10
Special Effects : 6.5/10
Enjoyment : 5/10
Character Development : 4/10<br/><br/>Is it really good for winning the Oscar? Hell No! I have no hate for Guillermo del Toro, he is best known for making cheesy stuffs and loved a lot of things that came out of his hands. This movie is not for everyone but made for some special bunch of people who won't find it sick but I did.<br/><br/>My final verdict, I give this movie : 5/10"
"scottduffus","6","4","6","8 February 2018"," The Shape of Water becomes a puddle
","For those of you who are Guillermo Del Toro fans please go and see this film as I am sure you will enjoy it. It carries all the trademark style of a Pans Labyrinth with weird creatures, maze-like caverns and a strong female character fighting against an evil male representing the military. You will be caught up in the romance of good overcoming evil and unlikely concepts of love.<br/><br/>However, if you are looking for a movie to be entertained then let me share with you why this is not for you. Warning there will be spoilers.<br/><br/>The story is set in the 1960's revolves around Elisa, a mute female janitor played by Sally Hawkins, who works at a water research facility. She is shown as a lonely woman with an older male neighbour, Giles, with whom she shares an affection for older movies, TV shows and music. At work, she cleans the facility with her friend Zelda, Octavia Spencer, who does enough talking for the two of them and while Elisa is mute she does not appear to have any problems communicating with others. One day while they are cleaning one of the research rooms, which could have been transferred directly from Frankenstein's castle, a water tank is brought in that is housing a large human-like creature. At the same time, we meet the evil security man, Strickland, who we learn is the real monster of the movie<br/><br/>Even though the monster rips two of Strickland's fingers off, Elisa feels a strong bond with the creature as they are both lonely and neither can speak. Even though the creature is military secret Elisa is able to sneak into the room where it is held and decides to share an egg with it. She then sneaks in an old style portable stereo with which she plays music to the creature with no one finding out. After teaching it sign language to say egg and music the emotional connection is complete and they are BFF's. Strickland decides that the creature is not of much value and decides to kill it and cut it up to see how it works. In true James Bond fashion, they set its termination for two days time instead of straight away.<br/><br/>Elisa finds out and makes a plan to help the creature escape. She recruits her gay neighbour, who is also lonely, to her mission and they arrange to break the creature out of a high-security military facility by placing it in a laundry basket and driving it out. Along the way, she is aided by a Russian spy/Professor who believes the creature should be saved even if it means Moscow misses out. Fellow janitor, Zelda, also becomes involved and they are able to rescue the creature and take it back to her small apartment where she keeps it in the bathtub. While she cares for it they become more than just friends and have sex. It might be a slimy creature from the Black Lagoon but it also has an impressive set of abs. The fact that this takes place after she fills up her bathroom with water which then leaks to the movie theatre below without anyone becoming suspicious or wanting to inspect her apartment is not explained. We also find that the creature has amazing healing powers as he cures Giles baldness but only after he bites one of his cat's head off.<br/><br/>In the meantime, the evil security officer tries to find out who stole the creature. Even though the security cameras were turned away so the rescuers could not be seen all he would have had to do was watch who was in the landing dock just before the cameras were adjusted and he would have seen Elisa. His woeful attempts to intimidate the janitors or find any clues makes you wonder how effective he has been in his job previously. Meanwhile, Elisa waits for the rainy season to come so she can release the creature into a canal which when it becomes deep enough will open up into the ocean thus releasing him 'Free Willy' style. It is never really explained why she can't just take him to the other side of the canal gate and drop him straight into the sea!!!<br/><br/>As time goes on the creature becomes sick and is losing his scales, Elisa grows more fond of him and Strickland finally gets closer to solving the puzzle by going after the wrong suspect. After some graphic violence, Strickland finally works it out that Elisa has the creature and is going to release him. In the pouring rain, as Elisa, Giles and the creature are saying their final goodbyes, Strickland arrives and shoots both Elisa and the creature and in his evil way gloats on his success. Suddenly the creature is able to heal himself of the bullet wounds, even though he couldn't stop his scales from flaking, and gives Strickland his comeuppance but not before he recognises that good beats evil. Zelda brings the police who all stay away from the shooting scene while Zelda races to the group to watch as the creature take Elisa with him into the canal. Once they are submerged he kisses her which not only brings her back to life but also gives her gills so they can all live happily ever after.<br/><br/>If the storyline sounds like nonsense - well it is, but it was directed by Guillermo Del Toro so it is stylish nonsense. The fact that it has been nominated for 13 Oscars says more about the competition than the quality of this movie I believe. At first, I really disliked it but having considered it further some of the actings wasn't too bad, the sets were good but as a fairy tale, it was no Little Mermaid.<br/><br/>6 friends out of 10"
"huey2088","6","4","6","18 January 2018"," Too many issues and unlike del Toro
","I LOVE del Toro's movies and his visionaries but this is so unlike his usual style. The originality has been crushed by way too mamy placement of B&W movies and especially Jeunet's Amelie - did Elisa (Sally Hawkins) walk past a burning chocolate factory called ""Ammalie?"" I really don't understand the French angle when the story is set in Cold War era in America that is also experiencing unimaginable racism and sexism. Added to the melting pot, is Elisa's neighbour Giles (Richard Jenkins) who is gay but his brief subplot is unnecessary and is clearly underdeveloped. Jenkin's presence and talent are wasted here as he meanders nostalgically through the movie but only comes alive when he interacts and helps Elisa with her ordeal.<br/><br/>The acting is overall superb. Hawkins is incredible as a long suffering lonely mute. Her whole body emotes her anguish, desperation and happiness down right to her sinewy fingers. Michael Shannon's villian is so foul and hateful, the very opposite to his conscientious and pitiable detective in Nocturnal Animals. He can take on any role and provoke viewers from beginning to the end. Octavia Davis is so loveable and bigger than life that she can't help but steal every scene she appears in. Doug Jones who is the hunted Amphibian Man looks very similar but is a more tortured Hell Boy's Abe Sapien whom he also played. I did wonder if SoW is Hell Boy's uncredited sequel.<br/><br/>SoW is simply about love - that it knows no boundaries and speaks through any languages. And this is what del Toro should have stuck with, the very essence of Pan's Labrynth. But this movie takes on too many issues, diluting the important main theme. It is no doubt visually stunning in colours and cinematography however at times, the typical del Toro melancholic beauty is replaced by graphic sex scene or violent gore. <br/><br/>It's unfair to keep comparing del Toro's earlier movies but their distinct visuals and out of the square box storylines are what made him different. I just hope he's not becoming the dull and predictable box office smash directors from the same Hollywood mould."

","Saw the Shape of Water, well most of it... 
The movie is basically about a mute woman who falls in love with a fish man. <br/><br/>She is mute but can hear. She is a cleaner in a secret government facility. Main protagonist is seen half naked and masturbating in her bathtub within the first ten minutes of the movie, apparently because she is lonely, cant seem to find a partner within her own species and has otherwise no ambitions in life other than masturbating, cleaning and Zoophilia... Sooo, said facility receives fish man for studies and planned dissection, which is not happening cause lonely, mute ""Zoophile"" is kidnapping fish man for her own sexual gratification. This is dressed up in the movie as her falling in love with it, because she has a disability or the condition of being mute and fish man taking her for what she is, because fish man isn't judging her like the rest seem to be as well as saving fish man from his fate. <br/><br/>Is this what the movie industry is descending into? Selling sex with different species better known as bestiality? Depicting people with conditions like being mute as the losers of society because they don't conform to societal norms and standards of this era? Like it was in the Goonies for example or countless villains who usually have a disability of sorts. This garbage is intellectually so lazy downright dumb that I didn't even finish it. Apparently she swims off with her sex pet in the end. <br/><br/>If you ask me, save yourself the time and go for a walk, bake something, or get laid. <br/><br/>Utter neoliberal rubbish, downright perverse"

","Dear movie freaks, The Shape of Water main story is not so original, because there are many fantasy and imagination about the creature from other world who are coming to human world and then they are falling in love each other. There is nothing special about this, but the movie The Shape of Water has a great cinematography and thanks to Guillermo del Torro who can give also the funny scenes and critical moments to make audience eyes stick to the screen. Some movies of fairytale is boring, but this one is not, so for me why this movie won Oscar is not about the storyline, but for the cinematography. I appreciate the producer who finally choose scene in America in the moment of Cold War, because this moment makes every scene looks easy to be connected: a poor painter, old cinema building, Russian spy on the scientist facility in America, Cadillac car as American Dream, etc. This movie story is not original, but because of American pop culture as the main idea of all scenes, this movie could be remembered as a fairytale with great cinematography. Congratulation Mr. Guillermo del Torro for your great work and you deserve Oscar for your hard work!"

It's so political correct on his fundament, you realize within 15 minutes of it being on screen that it won't come up with anything that doesn't fit in todays mainstream thinking. It may look and be strange sometimes, but in it's core it's so utterly disappointing mainstreaminsh and correct and stereotypical it almost hurts.<br/><br/>BUT, that makes it a distinctive movie of our times, a reflection of our current society. It wants to be strange and sometimes even disturbing but it doesn't have an impact and it doesn't have a soul. It tries hard, but it fails to come up with new thinking, new ideas or anything that would have an impact on me as I watch it.<br/><br/>Best example is the sex scene. It's useless, not shocking, just strange. Trying so hard to be something else it's doomed to be the same all over again.<br/><br/>Many good things in this movie, no doubt, but it's also far from being a future classic simply for the lack of a statement.

"siderite","6","7","13","14 March 2018"," The hype of water
","The film starts with an interesting premise: during the Cold War era, a US government research center has captured a strange amphibious creature and the protagonist is a mute cleaning lady. From the beginning the story overflows with symbols if intolerance: towards women, towards handicapped people, black people, amphibious people, immigrants, gays, old people, and so on and so on. It's like it's trying to check all the boxes, see how many it gets in a single row. But while it does this, the story itself just stalls. This is a two hour long movie in which nothing much happens. It shows intolerance, but doesn't go anywhere with it. Yes, we know people are assholes and that during that era, they were slightly worse than now. It does nothing for the plot, which is predictable and boring. <br/><br/>The bad man is reminiscent of Pan's Labyrinth villain and the main character a girl with an active imagination, but it is way slower and more poorly executed than Pan's. It is clearly a worse movie than that was. To put it mildly, I am at a loss for why this film won Best Picture. It was visually interesting, but you couldn't take it seriously. It went from metaphor to reality with no regard to the previous context. A villain that seemed to not have a purpose other than being obtuse and evil, a woman who after learning that the creature has bit two fingers off a man's hand goes near it and offers it food from her own hand, a black best friend who's only role is to gossip about her irrelevant husband, some Russian spies that seem more interested in food than in spying, the list goes on and on. It's not like the actors didn't do a good job, it's not that the direction or the sets were faulty, but the story itself was nothing more than a long slow cliche."

","Saw most of the movies nominated for best pic for 2017, but had not seen this one although I had wanted to. Had already determined I was going to see it the day after the Oscar awards, and had my interest piqued further when it won best picture. Perhaps it was due to having high expectations, but I left the theater feeling that it not only should not have won best picture, it shouldn't have been nominated. While it was very cleverly filmed, and no doubt required a lot of hard work to bring to the screen, I found it rather boring and stereotypical for this sort of genre. When the creature was first shown, I thought the make-up was incredible, but as the movie went on, it looked more and more like it was just a man in a rubber suit. And while obviously this kind of event isn't likely to ever happen, it can at least be made somewhat believable, but some of the scenes were ridiculous even for the subject matter. <br/><br/>For me, '3 billboards' should have won best picture for 2017. I thought it far more original than ""Shape,"" and actually cared about what happened to the characters. With 'Shape,"" I found I didn't care much about any of them."
"Prismark10","7","7","13","27 January 2018"," He has reached his peak
","Guillermo del Toro makes an adult version of ET with some added Beauty and the Beast, Starman and magical realism.<br/><br/>Set in early 1960s Baltimore with the Cold War in full swing. Sally Hawkins plays Elisa Esposito. She is mute, lonely with some scarring on her neck. Each morning is the same, bath, masturbate and get ready for work.<br/><br/>Elisa lives in a creaky apartment above a cinema. One of her few friends is in the neighbouring apartment who can sign with her. Giles (Richard Jenkins) is a veteran commercial artist who seems to have had some sort of breakdown, had drink problems and wants to have a relationship with the man working in a diner. <br/><br/>Elisa is a janitor in a top secret research lab with her best friend Zelda (Octavia Spencer.) The lab is doing experiments with an amphibious creature from the black lagoon (Doug Jones) captured by Strickland (Michael Shannon) in the Amazon. The creature as worshipped like a god but here he is experimented on and tortured.<br/><br/>Elisa when she is cleaning the lab manages to communicate with the creature. She feeds him boiled eggs, plays music and dances for him. She secretly feds him every night with egg and listens to music in his room, and they become close to each other. Her actions are unnoticed by Strickland but she has been observed by scientist Dr Hoffstetler (Michael Stuhlbarg) who also wants to understand the creature and he is unhappy that the go ahead has been given to dissect the creature.<br/><br/>Now there is a race against time to save the creature.<br/><br/>Guillermo del Toro has created a watery, fantasy, charming Gothic romance with too much teal. I think he realises this himself by giving Strickland a teal Cadillac. Shannon plays an effective, sneering villain who himself is enchanted with Elisa's silence. There is horror and humour in this movie with a song and dance sequence with an amphibian. I am sure Doug Jones must have enjoyed that."

"BojanNiceno","2","15","34","4 March 2018"," A far cry from Devil's Backbone and Pan's Labyrinth
","I am a great fan of Del Toro, essentially thanks to his masterpieces Devil's Backbone and Pan's Labyrinth, but this movie falls very short. The only compartment in which Del Toro advances over his previous works are visuals, filming is really stunning.<br/><br/>But for the rest, there is nothing. Story fits in the trailer. If you saw the trailer you know what is it about. A mute janitor girl falls in love with amphibian man kept in a laboratory, and helps him to get out. They end up together, in some dark water. From the trailer you can't really tell if they are dead or alive when together, but since it is Holywood movie you expect a happy ending. Hence, there is nothing to it, story is good enough for a short cartoon, and not very original.<br/><br/>This rather simple story was expanded to a movie by a juxtaposition of scenes and character from Del Toro's previous movies and movies from other director's as well. For instance, Eiise and Zelda are Little Mermaid and Flounder. Former a beauty without a voice, latter a friendly witty character talking for her and giving unconditional support. Then come Giles, friendly neighbor but hesitant to take their relationship any further. Funny enough Jenkins (Giles) had exactly the same role in ""The Visitor"". Add to the list one bad-to-the bone sociopat (Richard here, a copycat of office from Pan's Labyrinth) and a friendly educated helping hand (Dimitry here, doctor in Pan's Labyrinth). The bathroom scene is disturbingly reminiscent to the bathroom scene in ""Delicatessen"" from Jeunet and Carro. Violent scenes are copycats from Pan's Labyrinth (kill a man hitting him with a bottle in forehead in Labyrinth, with a baseball bat here; hurt a man by cutting his cheek open was also present in both movies).<br/><br/>On top of it, the movie has a couple of evident goofs. TV set with a remote control in 1962? Security cameras look sophisticated as if produced last year.<br/><br/>Funny enough, Pan's Labyrinth and Devil's Backbone are movies made for grown-ups in which main characters are children, whereas in ""The Shape of Water"" the main characters are adult, but the movie is for children. Indeed, if you deleted a couple of violent scenes or scenes with nudity you could play it to an 8-year old and he or she would love it."

"dreamhousebooks","9","6","11","2 May 2018"," Del Toro creates a magical tale about the shape of Love
","What truly makes The Shape of water standout is its treatment and the ingredients making it. It won't be for the first time that someone has chosen to tell a story about a fantasy creature. Yet, what makes TSW different from all the others of its genre is the perspective from which it is told and the things the film-makers have put the focus on.<br/><br/>The Shape of Water is primarily a love story between two completely different species who find the connection due to their inability to speak the language of the humans around them. Now that's something new, isn't it? Finding the connection not because of a common ability but a lacking capacity. This is just one of the things where Del Toro has tried to tell the tale from a new perspective. Backed by the old world charm and the beautiful Gothic yet pleasing production design, it all creates a world of fantasy for you that only has a slight resemblance to the world we live in. When the light flows on Del Toro's frames, it is nothing less than a celebration every time.<br/><br/>Sally Hawkins' character has so much rigor and strength to it that it almost amazes you to notice that people with a voice even can't bring out that much courage to show up when needed. Her will to save the Amphibian Man and the love of her life is almost empowering.<br/><br/>Del Toro and Vanessa Taylor have written the supporting characters also with a heart to it. Though I felt that Octavia Spencer's role was similar to the one she played in 'The Help' but it is Richard Jenkin's character that leave a dent on the audience with his charm and underlying sadness reflecting a life marred by voids. All these characters when come together create a fairy tale effect. I believe that it is loved by the masses because Del Toro at the right places chose to draw the right boundaries keeping the confinement of screenplay to an effective one. You never get bored and even though much isn't said throughout the film, every character stands out with layers to it. A well-deserved Oscar for the best movie. <br/><br/>Visit the Blog:- quickiereviewsmovies.blogspot.com"

This Movie failed in this respect as I was looking at my watch through out hoping the movie would end.<br/><br/>The other point to note about the Shape if Water, is that there are too many parallels with M Night Shyamalan's Lady In The Water (another adult farye tale and a movie which was ambitious but failed to deliver).
(1) the story is Centered around a being who lives in the water
(3) the water dwelling being is being hunted and is in need of protection
(2) the main character has a speech impediment

I mean it is almost pushed down our throats there is so much of it.<br/><br/> In my view the only reason the movie was set in 1962 was to try and set the movie apart from other movies of similar themes, one of which I mentioned earlier in this review.<br/><br/>So why did this movie win so many Oscars?

Coming to the movie itself, there are some good acting by all the lead players Sally, Richard and Michael.
Movie is shot quite retro and production values are top notch.
But, certainly not the best picture or director of 2018. I would consider it as an ordinary decent movie with a simple love story.
Only striking element to this movie is the titular character of the aqua-man itself. The Sci-Fi is top class and ingeniously conceived.
Other than this, its an overrated, over-hyped simple sci-fi love story.

","THE SHAPE OF WATER is, of course, Guillermo del Toro's latest opus and the first of his oeuvre to receive Oscars. I'm a long-time fan of the director, ever since I saw CRONOS back on television decades ago, so I was eager to check out a film which is quite clearly the director's homage to THE CREATURE FROM THE BLACK LAGOON. The end result is engaging and well made, as well directed as you'd expect from del Toro, but not without some serious flaws.<br/><br/>Sally Hawkins gives a thorough performance as the mute lead although her thunder is stolen by more striking turns from the likes of Michael Shannon (the most interesting he's been since BOARDWALK EMPIRE) and, of course, the great Doug Jones, who inevitably steals all his scenes. The first hour of set-up is intriguing and interesting alike, but I found that the pacing really stalled as soon as the creature relocates to the bathtub. At that point, del Toro seems to deliberately stall things, in no hurry to get to the rushed climax, so it all becomes drawn out and embarrassingly romantic. The black-and-white musical interlude is the low point here, an overly indulgent scene that had me cringing. It's a pity, as this makes the film fall below the likes of the HELLBOY films or del Toro's excellent Spanish-language movies."

Scratch the surface, just below the admittedly fine cinematography, and there is little depth to plumb. The story line is just about as predictable as they come. Each scene following on from the previous one in typical Hollywood fashion, is as expected, no surprises, no deeper, and original narrative.

","*SPOILERS*
The movie takes 20 minutes of introducing us to the main character and her life. The beginning provides a few laughs, sets the tone, but it's way too stretched out and contains useless details that will never pay off later. Maybe they realized that they bored the audience, so they jump right into the fish creature romance. <br/><br/>There's a disgusting and possibly dangerous alien fish creature chained in a laboratory and the main character starts immediately feeding it and flirting with it! I get it, it's perceived as different from the norm, which is a symbol for the minorities that are featured in the movie (gay, mute, black) and all of them work together in the end. But it looks like a monster that could easily be featured in a horror movie and the script skipped any rational initial caution, followed by a slow build up of sympathy and intimacy. Instead, the movie wanted me to be invested and accepting from the beginning and it didn't work for me one bit. Famously, there is the scene where the lady is screwing with the fish, which is just... wrong. <br/><br/>The bad guys are so stereotypical bad, it's really cheesy. Again, the symbolism is clear: it's a commentary on the culture of the 1960ies (and possibly still today). But can you really judge people of a former decade with today's morals? Anyway, the movie does not do anything intellectually challenging with this. Instead, the third act ended completely predictable with a showdown that reminded me a lot of E.T. <br/><br/>The movie is incredibly well shot and the acting is mostly solid ( a bit over the top on the villains' part) but it does not live up to it's full potential. Of course this won the best picture votes from the older Academy members, because it briefly shows a couple of old movie scenes and it's nostalgic for the late 1950ies / early 60ies."

","""The Shape of Water"" is a film that is not for everyone. First, I must warn any die-hard cat lovers NOT to watch the movie, as there's a very explicit scene where a cat has its head bitten off! Second, if nudity bothers you, please find another picture to watch, as there is significant nudity...much of it full frontal nudity...and more than you'd typically see in a rate-R picture. This is not so much a complaint...more something the viewer should be aware of before they try watching the story.<br/><br/>The story itself is a very dark and rather nasty tale about an amphibious creature who has somehow been captured by the US government. Instead of trying to communicate with it, the guy in charge mostly tortures it and plans on having it dissected. At the same time, Soviet spies want to kill it because somehow they think he's a potential weapon to be used against them(??). However, a mute and sexually frustrated cleaning lady falls for the creature and decides, with the help of her gay friend, to rescue the 'thing'.<br/><br/>So did I like it? Not especially. Although I love how unusual and creative the film was, so much of it was filled with nasty and awful characters (something Guillermo Del Toro loves, I know)...but too nasty for my taste. In other words, the guy playing the boss was almost cartoonish in the way he was written....and instead of seeing him as a villain, he seemed a bit more like Boris from ""The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle""! Strange but not especially enjoyable...and I am feeling a bit tired of the director's overwhelming need to show such extreme and realistic violence. And so, as is too often the case, I wonder how a movie in recent years received the Best Picture Oscar when it's not enjoyable to watch.<br/><br/>
FYI--A decent Florida Key Lime Pie is NOT fluorescent green like it was in the movie. I assume the director used this color as a commentary on the era and the way colored dyes were more the norm...especially since he also chose to have green Jello in another scene.<br/><br/>Also, while the lead was played by a woman who was hearing and learned a few signs in order to communicate in the movie, it seems like a lost opportunity not to have a deaf actress play the part.

","Shape of Water gets a lot of praise and maybe some Oscars but for sure not because of inventive and creative storytelling or cinematography but because - it got a ""good"" message.<br/><br/>Objectively this movie is a total boring affair: the love story is forced and boring, the villains are boring, the heroes are boring, the pace of the story, the visuals - all just boring.<br/><br/>I don't mind a storytelling that gets my neurons exploding, but this one is really just some ""p.c.-crap"" in disguise. Del Toro once showed that he can do and tell us outstanding stuff (Pan's Labyrinth, of course), but in that movie he left the conclusions to the audience, now he is just screaming at us, what is good and what is bad. His characters are slapstick not real people.<br/><br/>Pacific Rim was imo one step into the direction of going into the lower planes of Hollywood blockbuster movie-making like Emmerich and the like. The Shape of Water is another. Hollywood spoiled another director.<br/><br/>The Shape is not a total disaster but - nothing really good or special."
"drchandran","1","12","29","27 January 2018"," The stink of water
","Very disappointed in this movie. I had seen Pan's Labyrinth previously and liked it; thought this would be a more mature work but instead was subjected to a criminally boring, overrated piece of sentimental mush, gratuitous nudity + sex, and nauseating political correctness. Please take my advice and stay away from this storytelling disaster and insult to people's intelligence. <br/><br/>Spoilers ahead.
A few of the 100 questions that sprang into mind as I watched this awful movie I have for the director:
(1) ?the purpose of showing the lady masturbating/ nude every day. Completely gratuitous.
(2) ?painting the villain so black it was cartoonish. He is a white Christian man so he is racist, sexist, misogynist, anti-science and anti-color green. Also for some weird reason he does not was his hands after he pees. Because he is truly blackhearted.
(3) ?5-star general in charge of national security etc, has zero judgment, bullies a scientist for no good reason, and is a complete buffoon, saying laughable things like ""you will be in a different universe blah blah""
(4) ?young man who is accosted by man old enough to be his grandfather is wrong to rebuff him because this means he is homophobic. Also suddenly turns out to be racist so obviously he is a villain too. (even though he is Canadian!)
(5) ?mute lady and black lady are heroines, so everything they do is ok even though it makes no logical sense. Mute lady is shy and diffident (no previous boyfriend even) but suddenly is adventurous enough to initiate and consummate an interspecies romance with a scaly fish like creature which was just a minute ago trying to eat her friend's cat. Her friends (black lady and gay man= so they must be ok) don;t think it is utterly crazy for her to break the law, steal things from a govt facility, have physical relationship with a weird fish creature even though this is 1960 or something and the height of cold war and the creature ate the man's cat!!!. 
(6) ?extraordinary creature which is from the Amazon (fresh water river) but needs 3% salinity, is intelligent enough to learn sign language etc. but doesn't know not to eat cat, kills cat but leaves it uneaten and runs off when startled by a human he already knows, is somehow invisible because he manages to get into movie theater and watch a movie (!!) without being spotted even after leaving blood webprints on the glass window of the movie ticket keeper (!), can heal himself from the bullet wounds but not the heroine's wounds, likes touching peoples heads for no explicable reason except that the bald man starts sprouting hair.
(7) ?top secret government facility has no competent people except a Russian scientist, cleaners can go wherever they like and play music and dace with top secret fish creature, loading dock camera is more important than having camera at the door or inside of most secret room with top secret fish, cannot figure out who stole the fish (all they have to do is find out who is buying 10 tins of salt from the grocer everyday) and stealing protein powder or something from the lab<br/><br/>I could go on and on but I hope you get the drift.
Utter drivel from a filmmaker who has done some really excellent work in the past.
So disappointing.

","Giulleromo del Toro's 'The Shape of Water' is a beautiful visual enterprise, set in a surreally exaggerated, but immaculately imagined and rendered alternative version of 1950s America. It's also a poetic love story. But behind the beautiful cosmetic detail, there's no real story beyond a straightforward account of good versus evil and love versus hate; there's simply no way to identify with the characters, attractive or repulsive, in the way one relates to normal, flawed human beings. There are rare movies (I can think of 'Edward Scissorhands' or 'Delicatessen') which tell a profound human story within a stylised fantasy universe. Without that, what we're left with feels very much like a comic book: it may be beautifully drawn, but there's no depth to what's portrayed."

"rbr-41299","4","4","7","25 September 2018"," The Shape of Prejudice
","I have to say the film was beautifully shot and reflects an artistic approach with its use of color and texture. The actors all do a superlative job in their respective roles. The film has some delightful moments, like the scene of the dancing feet of Giles and Elise (shades of the film Chaplin?). Zelda is given numerous funny lines and she delivers them just right. The period details of architecture, food, clothing, appliances, furnishings, and television entertainment were well researched and gave a real sense of time and place. The director Guillermo del Toro described his film as a ""fairy tale for troubled times."" To me it's the film that is troubled due to many negative elements and dark tone.<br/><br/>Elise is introduced as a mute, introverted and sensitive woman who loves art, music and dancing. Then in a surprising scene we see the heroine fully nude masturbating in the bathtub. (Why?) Beneath her quiet faÃ§ade is a sexually passionate woman, a woman who yearns for romance. For her romance finds its object in the Amphibian Asset. Unlike the original Beauty and the Beast story in which the beast is actually a human prince that had been cursed (and then restored), the Amphibian Asset is not human and never will be. The result is that sex between Elise and the Amphibian Asset really constitutes bestiality.<br/><br/>The polar opposite of Elise is Strickland who is the real ""monster"" from del Toro's point of view. Strickland is really a caricature of all the worst characteristics the Leftist writer can imagine for a fundamentalist Christian. He is rude and sexually crude. He makes personal and moral observations based on the Bible, which reveal prejudices. He sees himself as the image of God and the Amphibian Man, not having that image, deserves to die. He is clearly superior to the hired help. He's the head of his house, his wife a dutiful housewife, ready to service her husband to take care of his needs.<br/><br/>For all the effort given to make a ""period film,"" del Toro includes many elements without any basis in reality. The Asset is taken to an aerospace research laboratory, which of course did not exist in Baltimore in 1962. The reason for taking the creature there is unclear. The film features a five-star Air Force General, which did not exist at the time. The last five-star General died in 1953. An annoying detail is that the General's military ribbons were not in the correct order. The story focuses on the space race between the U.S. and the USSR. At that time NASA, a civilian agency, was in charge of space exploration, not the military. Yet there is no mention of NASA in the movie. The writer also gives supernatural powers to the creature, who is able to stimulate hair growth in Giles and heal him, and later heals himself and Elisa, as well as creating gills in Elisa so she can breathe under water. Maybe the Asset was really extraterrestrial.<br/><br/>del Toro attempted to convey a certain message through the film, portraying from his point of view the lack social justice for issues like animals rights, gay rights and racial equality. He implies that nothing positive has changed in America since the 1960s while ignoring the fact that the country was run by Democrats in the 1960s. In the end he really wanted to proclaim his prejudice against traditional Christian values."
"hemmensm","7","4","7","30 July 2018"," Interesting and unique
","This Oscar winning movie does a great job at depicting what looked like a crazy or impossible plot with wonderful scenery, special effects and a more than mediocre performance by its actors. The story is compelling and it makes you root for its characters as if you knew them in person and besides it's cliches and predictability, it never lets you down. In the end this is an intreaguing and fun movie although it dosnt stand out from the crowd and it dosnt leave you thinking about it for days and weeks, but it still does a good job at making an impossibly fictional premise into a plausible, calm and down to earth film."
"The_Film_Auditor","9","4","7","17 July 2018"," Fun retro story with great visuals
","Guillermo del Toro, knocked his newest film, The Shape of Water, out of the park. The film is a magical ride from scene to scene that mesmerizes the viewer with amazing cinematography, beautiful visuals, and an astounding soundtrack. That's not all; the acting in this film is fantastic. Sally Hawkins, Michael Stuhlbarg, Doug Jones, and Richard Jenkins are all amazing in this film, but my two personal favorites were Octavia Spencer and Michael Shannon. Octavia was hilarious in this movie as well as a great supporting character to Hawkins since her character was mute. I thought Shannon did a great job creating a compelling villain. You hated his character for the things he did, but you couldn't help but love watching him.<br/><br/>Another thing I loved about The Shape of Water is how it played with genres. It was mostly a sci-fi/fantasy romance, but also included thriller aspects and (spoiler) musical aspects. I always love when films cross genres, and this film does it wonderfully. It is really what makes the film as unique as it is (that and del Toro's style as well).<br/><br/>I still haven't discussed the story, which was also fantastic. The plot, which flows very nicely and keeps you entertained throughout, reminds me of an old monster movie turned love story. The film has a strong message about relationships and people who are different, which makes this film very timely. Overall, I loved this film and would recommend this to anyone, since I think that there is something that everyone can take out of this film."
"jackgdemoss","8","4","7","15 July 2018"," Shaped up to be a good film
","Ignoring its roots in fantasy, The Shape of Water is one of the most emotionally human films I have seen this year. The bonds between our protagonist and her friends (human or not) were prominent, even with characters who had less screen time. One improvement that could have been made was with our antagonist, who seemed quite forced and undriven. Was the film deserving of 4 Oscars, including best picture? Probably not. But that shouldn't stop you from spending a quiet night enjoying Guillermo del Toro's golden egg."
"Mike_Devine","4","4","7","2 June 2018"," If boredom were a shape, it would be the same shape as 'Water'
","There have been countless depictions of unusual friendships that turn into full-fledged relationships depicted on the silver screen over the years. Think of 'Edward Scissorhands' or 'Her.' But the one that transpires in 2017's Academy Award-winning 'The Shape of Water' is something unlike we've ever seen, for better or worse (mostly for worse).<br/><br/>At the core of 'Water' is the story of lonely mute Elisa Esposito (Sally Hawkins) who works the night shift as a janitor at a secret government research facility. She befriends her colleague Zelda (perennial Oscar nominee Octavia Spencer) and the two stumble upon an amphibious creature that is held captive in the facility. Elisa quickly develops a friendship with said creature, and thus begins a quest to free him, which becomes a much bigger production than anticipated.<br/><br/>While on the surface, this is a love story (an unorthodox one, at that), there's a lot going on in 'Water.' There's a sub-plot involving a spy game with KGB agents, which makes sense given the Cold War backdrop, but the true antagonist is the facility's director, Richard Strickland (played masterfully by Michael Shannon), who is out for blood and to weaponize the creature against the Soviets. But the main focus is on the creature, which is understandable given director Guillermo del Toro's fascination with monsters. It is well done, CGI-wise, but that doesn't mean the film as a whole is amazing. In fact, 'Water' is your typical critically acclaimed Oscar bait whose boredom masquerades as beauty.<br/><br/>Sure, the use of water in this film is kind of intriguing, with one scene in particular coming to mind involving a flooded bathroom. But the plot is so odd and out there. This is a case where being different with a capital ""D"" actually works against the film. It just exists - nothing to write home about, and surely not deserving of a best picture Oscar.<br/><br/>'The Shape of Water' will not be remembered for years to come, and if it is, it will be for all the wrong reasons."
"daoldiges","6","4","7","16 May 2018"," Visually interesting but highly predictable
","I've enjoyed much of this director's previous work and like those, I found this film to be visually sumptuous and endlessly interesting to look at. Unfortunately though, the story was very predictable, the characters cookie-cutter and ultimately did not match up to the visual delights on offer. Unless you're a serious fan of the director I would not consider this essential viewing."
"grantss","6","4","7","12 May 2018"," Okay, but hardly Oscar-worthy
","It is the mid-1960s. Elisa is mute, and a cleaner at a US government experiment facility. Her life is quite mundane and unfulfilled. Then the facility starts on a new project: the US government has captured a man-fish hybrid in South America and now they are seeing if the creature's unique physiology could have some uses for humans, especially for astronauts. Elisa becomes attached to the creature.<br/><br/>The winner of Best Picture at the 2018 Oscars, though difficult to see why. A pretty basic movie - a linear romantic drama with one-dimensional characters, cartoonish, badness-laid-on-so-thick-it's-laughable villains, conventional plot development and a fairly predictable ending. It's not that profound or original in its themes or development (unless the viewer has only seen a handful of movies in their life) - quite dumbed-down (though that might be more a reflection of modern audiences than anything else). If it wasn't for the excellent CGI, the sentimentality, the slickness of the plot development and some of the performances it would be just another B-grade creature feature.<br/><br/>Part of the problem is that director Guillermo del Toro tries to steer a path between fairy tale and gritty drama, and thus ends up with something that is tonally jarring and inconsistent. The movie from the start has a light, airy feel, the ideal set up for a sweet, all-ages drama. There's even some funny moments to help this along. Yet, interspersed with the lightness are several adult-orientated scenes. Even as the movie becomes darker, bloodier and grittier, del Toro still tries to cling to the fairy tale side.<br/><br/>Made as a plain fairy tale-like drama, suitable for all ages, this would have worked a whole lot better.<br/><br/>Not that it's that bad though. The movie moves at a decent pace and is quite entertaining. There is a decent level of intrigue and tension and Sally Hawkins puts in a great performance as Elisa."

","Grade: A-<br/><br/>In a Nutshell: Certified fresh! This ""adult fairy tale"" was produced, directed, and written by Guillermo Del Toro. The film combines a love story with science fiction and Cold War drama. Some critics have likened it to Beauty And The Beast meets Creature from the Black Lagoon. It's odd, for sure.<br/><br/>
This film has received more Oscar nominations than any other film! Many of them are technical noms. We'll see how many they win.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Tips for parents: <br/><br/>This movie is rated R for a reason. It's not appropriate for children's viewing.
A LOT of full frontal nudity of a woman. Another woman opens her shirt to reveal her bare chest.

Things I liked:<br/><br/>Sally Hawkins gives a really great performance with no words. Guillermo Del Toro said that he wrote the movie with only her in mind. Her character's last name is ""Esposito"" which is Italian, given to orphaned children, meaning ""exposed"" or ""abandoned.""
Michael Shannon is fantastic, as always. He successfully makes you hate his guts. 
The talented ensemble also includes Richard Jenkins, Doug Jones, and Academy Award winner Octavia Spencer.
Some people watch a classic scene from a Shirley Temple movie. Music and dance play a role in the movie.
Beautiful production design with incredible colors. It uses practically every shade of green.
I loved the Old Hollywood nods to lots of other movies.
A surprising musical number.
Doug Jones spent three hours every day to get into his costume.<br/><br/>
Things I didn't like:<br/><br/>Way too much nudity, awkward sex, and crude language.
The end is pretty predictable.
A bit of a creepy love affair.<br/><br/>
Interesting lines:<br/><br/>""He's not even human."" - Giles (Richard Jenkins)
""If we do nothing, neither are we."" - Elisa Esposito (Sally Hawkins)<br/><br/>""Life is but the shipwreck of our plans."" - Daily Thought
""I'm not a good liar...except Bruster. It takes a lot of lies to keep a marriage going."" - Zelda (Octavia Spencer)"

","I'm not sure how I feel about this movie. There is no denying that there is some beautiful visuals. And the romance is very beautiful at times too. But sometimes its also weird. I mean, he is an intelligent creature and I can get why she would see something more in him, but then in the next scene he's eating a cat. And its like.....that doesnt put her off? That doesnt make her take a step back and think ""Am I sure about this?"" I get that its a fantasy. A Modern fairytale if you will and therefore its not going to be hyper realistic and scenes are going to be embellished, but I dont feel like it works all the time either.<br/><br/>Sally Hawkins though is incredible and definitely deserves that oscar nomination. Its especially impressive because she really has to rely on her face and body movements. Octavia Spencer was good but you could honestly replace her with her character from The Help or Hidden Figures and you would never know the difference. She does the same thing in each of those movies. Richard Jenkins is good and very heartwarming too. I wanted to be friends with him. Michael Shannon is a great villain. He definitely is unhinged in the last act. And he plays it well. Doesnt top his performance in Take Shelter though. <br/><br/>I do think Guillermo deserves being nominated for directing because he is a beautiful filmmaker. I especially loved the scene where she wants to tell the creature how she feels and its conveyed through song. I thought it was so good how was shot and a beautiful nod to old Hollywood too. I think if anything the script was lost on me at times."

The beautiful colors, lighting design and scenery tick all the right boxes for the award season (along with the two leading ladies, Octavia Spencer as the forceful cleaner and Sally Field in the main role, as her frail, mute collegue, who threads through life in a touchingly heartwarming way. There's the gay neighbor and the cruel white boss, so we got all the ingredients for a money-shoveling crowd-pleaser.

If such a creature was ever discovered in the real world, the scientific community would guard it so heavily that no one like the brutal keeper would ever get near it. There would be observation 24/7, and the military would never get near it. And the Cleaning Lady? In what fantasy world would the cleanup staff have free access to such an incredible scientific find? ""Oh, it's only a movie, and it's here to tell a story and the story is Soooooooo relevant...."" Please, spare us the platitudes. For the Academy to choose this picture for Best Picture once again shows that they are completely out of touch with those of us who actually go to the movies to watch them. Each year when I see which films are nominated, I scratch my head in wonder at how they can continue to nominate movies that almost no one has ever heard of, or are contrived to suit some crusade the director or producer is championing, or is a thought-provoking sketch about some social ill. How about some day we get back to nominating movies that people can enjoy watching? I long for the days of movies like Gone With The Wind, or Ben-Hur, or The Ten Commandments. Instead, Hollywood gives us garbage like a reformatted Ghostbusters with a female crew of specialists, or the seventh remake of The King and I. There appear to be no real new ideas for movies anymore. Some of the remakes are okay, but few really need to be made. Time to get some originality back in the game and stop the idiocy of more silly films nominated by an increasingly out-of-touch bunch of so-called professionals in the Academy. How about some real people out here having some input into the process?"

"mb1456","6","5","10","8 March 2018"," I Didn't Like the Shape of the Story..
","At first, congratulations to Guillermo del Toro for the Best Director Oscar for this movie. I guess one of the main reasons for that is how he got all the actors to deliver excellent performances especially Michael Shannon(as the ruthless colonel Strickland) and Sally Hawkins(the mute cleaning woman Elisa who falls for the amphibian man). The movie also offers beautiful visuals(of a 60's era) and also the effects are masterfully done.<br/><br/>So, on paper it seems like a fascinating movie but ends up as a surprise disappointment. For one, I don't understand the need for a sexual scene that involves Strickland or even if we were to ignore that, the use of graphic violence many times. As a viewer, I could already feel the brutality of his character in many scenes that didn't have an explicit display of blood or gore. Maybe the writers were not confident they could deliver a wonderful cinematic experience without them. Some moments were even unintentionally funny. There's a song & dance routine like in Bollywood between Elisa & the amphibian man, thankfully that gets over within a minute. And the climax encounter between this amphibian dude & Strickland where in those final brief moments, we see this thing all of a sudden emote and fight back like a pissed off lover! Another aspect of the movie that annoyed me is a remark by one of the characters Zelda(very well essayed by Octavia Spencer), Elisa's close confidante at work, about her dislike for people who biologically look a certain way. It was a minor conversation but I found it offensive and irrelevant to the story. <br/><br/>So unfortunately, Shape of Water is a thumbs down for me. It could really have been an otherwise epic cinema. If you still want to, watch for the shape of performances and the beautiful cinematography."

","As a big fan of Guillermo del Toro, I don't get the hype. Sure, it's a well polished movie with solid performances and dialogue. But it's predictable to the point of being boring and completely lacks the imaginative creativity that is the hallmark of movies like Pan's Labyrinth, Hellboy, Cronos and even Pacific Rim, to a lesser extent. Just does not even feel like a del Toro movie to me at all."

","This ""somehing"" cannot be mentioned on the same page with the Pan's labyrinth.
This is very booooring. This was very difficult to keep my attention on the screen while watching. Even though there are very good cast all the roles are uninteresting. Mr. Jenkins who is a very very great actor was he best for me but as his role was uninteresting that did not help the story.
There are many happenings in the story that are out of place and illogical.
The only good point is the vision, the colours and maybe the music.
The 13 Oscar nominations? Why?
It was a very big disappointment. I don't understand the hype at all.

"techbklukat","1","15","41","18 March 2018"," The Shape of Disbelief
","I am always game for a good fantasy movie. Some of my favorites are the LOTR releases and Pan's Labarynth, which del Toro also directed. I was excited to see this movie because I believe in his vision. I didn't read any reviews but just went in blind.
This movie for me was a major disappointment. The characters are totally two-dimensional. I get it, Strickland is a baddie and Elisa is a lonely woman with a heart of gold. This movie is mainly about society's broken things. People who are achingly lonely inside of their own lives, I get it. You don't have to hit me over the head with this angle by showing Elisa feverishly masturbating in the tub or Giles getting rebuffed angrily by the pie-shop hottie. Or Zelda constantly complaining about her significant other. I understand, people will go to extraordinary, even bizarre measures, to find companionship and love. Human beings for the most part want to connect, to belong.
But no, I cannot fathom any woman having sex with the amphibian creature. This whole part of story line made me so uncomfortable I really wanted to turn the movie off. The only reason I didn't was because I wanted to see how it ended. Should not have bothered because the ending was the most absurd part of the movie.
So Elisa learns to exist underwater with fish-man? How exactly would THIS work? The answer is it would not, on any level. This movie would have worked had Elisa and fish-man connected on a platonic level. I could have totally bought it. Still trying to figure out why the laughable dance/song sequence was thrown in. Was the movie not long enough?
The sets and filming are gorgeous, 50's cold-war era meets steampunk. The film score is magical. The rest of the movie is a complete waste of time. del Toro, and other directors, need to learn the whole idea of nuanced characters. People are (generally speaking) not all good nor all bad. When two-dimensional characters are developed and poor dialogue is written it is just plain laziness."
"millsrent","1","11","28","6 March 2018"," R rated ET: Gross sexual movie aiming at sophistication
","A disgusting film with no redeeming value. From the very beginning the story approaches themes of loneliness, sexual fantasy, and lust/desire around a central deaf woman character and her love affair with a fishman. Her desire for connection and sex release puts her into a love affair with a strange amphibious creature found in the jungles- This is not a movie for families or fantasy buffs, It's a graphic allegory with E.T. like themes that will turn your stomach. I had a hard time looking beyond the crass and banal lives of those trying to take advantage of the fishman or trying to help it. In the end, both sides do with it what they will. And ultimately, what you are left with are bad memories. 
The story is inconsistent, the movie is a bit insipid, vulgar, and disgusting and, safe to say, you will not miss anything from not watching this very unreal, simplistic predictable movie. You will only be left wondering how in the world did it achieve best picture oscar award?"
"HEFILM","5","11","28","9 January 2018"," A deranged low budget Spielberg movie
","The movie has no sense of balance. It tries to do too much and doesn't do enough of what it does very well.<br/><br/>Del Toro seems to always insist on R ratings--which so far sunk his Lovecraft adaptation AT THE MOUNTAINS OF MADNESS from happening. He likes to mix ugly and fantasy--sometimes this works, this time it doesn't.<br/><br/>In this case you have rather graphic nudity and violence mixed in with Spielberg type elements. Or maybe it's just that the design and performance of the fishman looks like skinny guy in a Ok monster suit.<br/><br/>Mix this up with Cold War crisis and artificial period ambience and a frustrated gay sub plot and what do you have, I guess like water is has no shape and pardon the pun but a snail-like pace.<br/><br/>Other problem is the villain is overdone, it'd be more interesting if the villain wasn't one dimensional.<br/><br/>Oh and did I mention the musical scene? It's a bold idea executed in a flat fashion that is unintentionally funny--or like too much of the film it wants to have it both ways, be funny but true in spirit, ugly but fantastical.<br/><br/>Del Toro's English films often suffer from clunky dialogue, this one does too and mixes in too much modern foul language for the period story.<br/><br/>Yeah what are all these things doing in one movie? Adding up to a movie that doesn't work."

Firstly the messages in the story were quite forced. There were obviously messages of racism and other such discrimination against different groups. It all felt very forced and I never felt like when the messages where delivered they were being said by the characters with personalities and not some Hollywood writer. The pacing felt all over the place and felt rushed near the end. There were some minor problems also like how their were shell casings coming out of a revolver.

It would have been better to have more in-depth background info about Eliza and Strickland. I know we are told about Eliza's trauma as a baby but to see if on film and have flashbacks and more character depth would have really drawn me in even more.

I've played computer games that are set in the past but with forward looking technology, and I'm sure many other movies have done the same, and The Shape of Water pulls it off perfectly.
No real twists - no complex plots - just a great story with great meaning, delivered beautifully.

It is littered with references, from the beginning with the red shoes and cinema offerings, great subtlety and colour. Did anyone else notice the way the heroine blinks at the ""interrogation""? PAY ATTENTION!<br/><br/>The director's usual mastery of using colour palette to descibe, enhance and explain proceedings (did you notice that in Pan's Labirinth I wonder?, or the film noir type shots in this?)<br/><br/>Watch the colour as it is integral to the story.<br/><br/>Were they really ""goofs""?

"doxxman5","10","3","5","27 July 2018"," formally perfect
","This is a movie that resonated with me as most of Del Toro's work does , and it is formally perfect. It takes aspects of horror, fantasy, romance, thriller, espionage, slavery, racism, period piece, and sci-fi and shakes them up to produce some kind of odd masterwork that will never be duplicated. The movie's cast works off each other perfectly, as everyone stands out together. The musical score and cinematography are just about perfect as well and take the best influences from the past and turn them into something new. The structure of the story is interesting, as most movies would stay with what happens in the first part of the movie for the majority of the film, but what normally be the climax (the big escape) scene actually happens in the middle of the film and the aftermath (the hunt for the creature) takes over and the movie becomes a mediation on the meaning of life. Shape of Water dares to explore every subject possible to explore in a move in 2 hours, and the fact that the dense nature of the movie does not implode under its own weight is.....a miracle. In that context, a woman falling in love with an Amazon fish-god makes perfect sense."
"peterp-450-298716","6","3","5","31 March 2018"," ""Free Willy"" for adults this time.
","""The natives in the Amazon worshipped it.
Like a god.
We need to take it apart, learn how it works.""<br/><br/>I've watched this movie the night before the Oscar ceremony, because I could feel it in my bones this film would possibly win that coveted statuette. Initially, I didn't want to post my opinion about this winner. But as I had partially written down my opinion, I thought I would smooth off the rough edges and post it anyway. To be honest, I'm not part of the great crowd of admirers of ""The shape of water"". Even though I was looking forward to it with great expectations and knew it was a creation made by Guillermo del Toro (I appreciated his previous films) I was only moderately enthusiastic about it. In the end I stayed behind with a ""that's it ?"" feeling. Why the jurors of the academy massively fell in love with this film, still is a mystery to me. I didn't think it was so earth-shattering, breathtaking or groundbreaking.<br/><br/>In retrospect, you could compare this film with ""Free Willy"". Only the amphibious creature that needs to be rescued rather looks like the monster of ""Creature from the Black Lagoon"". And as in ""Free Willy"", where Jesse wanted to free his best friend, it's Elisa Esposito (Sally Hawkins) who got the job of freeing the imprisoned creature. Only the friendship between Jesse and Willy wasn't as passionate and they didn't get caught while doing sensual stuff. Elisa and her scaly friend soon figured out how to get things going. Or rather, Elisa soon knew where her sweet sprat was hiding his stinger. So you can expect some wet scenes. And the facility where the government locked away the feared cretature (under military supervision) so they can experiment with it, was probably designed by an interior architect who's influenced by the interior style that you could admire in the Nautilus.<br/><br/>""The shape of water"" is of course more than just a rescue mission that has been set up by a cleaning lady without sound. A cleaning lady whose compassion causes her to start smuggling hard boiled eggs inside and draw up a plan (bigger than that in ""The Great Escape"") to save the poor merman. ""The shape of water"" is also more than just a romantic concoction in which a scrumptious cleaning lady throws herself into the fins of a wondrous creature and loses herself completely after looking deep into those bulging fish eyes. Guillermo Del Torro denounces indifference and prejudice and makes it the central theme. A theme that also applies in our contemporary society. Being different as an individual and the excluding and exploiting by those who see themselves as normal, is symbolized here in many ways. A cleaning lady who is voiceless. And her colleague (Octavia Spencer) who has a different skin color. A somewhat older, homosexual neighbor (Richard Jenkins) whose flirtation was not appreciated by the owner of an ice-cream shop. And last but not least the miraculous seahorse. First a riddle and afterwards a threat.<br/><br/>Just like in ""Crimson Peak"", again Del Torro delivers a visually overwhelming spectacle. The used images are at times magical and atmospheric. Elisa's residence and the colorful advertising posters made by the neighbor. The cinema complex and the ice cream bar that exhale the atmosphere of the 1960s. The military complex that looks sterile and metallic, full of obscure secrets and where less attractive experiments are carried out. It all looks perfect and breathtaking. And such quality needs of course high quality acting. This sublime acting is taken care of by renowned actors. Sally Hawkins is as enchanting as her salted new friend. And even though there is no sound coming out of her mouth, she knows how to grasp you by using her highly expressive facial expressions. Michael Shannon was also briliant as the dominant and cruel government agent who (with apparent pleasure) tests his taser on our fishy guy. He's a pervert whose sexual urges go into overdrive when the partner stays silent during the act. No wonder his hormones go haywire after seeing (and not hearing) Elisa. Finally, kudos for Richard Jenkins and Octavia Spencer.<br/><br/>Without a doubt, Guillermo del Toro is a master in visualizing and a kind of visionary. He creates a unique atmosphere in his films that you hardly be able to take it all in. I'm never really overwhelmed by the content of his films though. Perhaps the message is sophisticated enough. But every time I have that feeling it's incomplete somehow. I suppose that the simmering topic in this film is in line with the values that were spread out this year during the awards. The equality of genders. Not tolerating cross-border behavior. And the fact that the Academy Awards are a more white-tinted business. I guess it's all about striking the right chords."
"woodsman2018","6","3","5","26 February 2018"," 3 basic criticisms.
","1) I need WAY MORE insight into the motivations for a villain like Richard Strickland. What happened to him to make him the way he is? - otherwise he is a stock character we are simply intended to hate and root against. Was this edited out? He is on the screen way too long to not be developed more. His final words were ""I guess you are a god"". Maybe that is a clue given his character's biblical allusions?<br/><br/>2) The plot was entirely predictable and the first ten minutes in we knew how it would proceed and end. This just seemed like a missed opportunity to make it more interesting.<br/><br/>3) Why would we need gratuitous violence when Hoffstetler is killed? Was it because of the finger biting theme that we are supposed make the connection? That seemed odd to me - and I have seen his other movies so I know he has a thing for detailed violence.<br/><br/>Enjoyed the look of the film but the predictability of the denouement made the third quarter drag - resulting in the loss of suspended disbelief. Still unsure what the POINT was.<br/><br/>Get Out, and 3 billboards are far more interesting and challenging movies than this. The shape of water will be forgotten pretty quickly despite all the oscar hysteria."
"munoz","6","3","5","19 February 2018"," Amazing cinematography, music and acting--but too much gore and focus on the villain
","I've rarely seen a movie that was so hard to rate.<br/><br/>The cinematography is breathtaking, and so is the music. Pure art! And the actors were all the perfect choice for their characters. You could definitely tell that del Toro had most of them already in mind when the film was just in its planning stages.<br/><br/>However, it's not a flawless movie, and I'm actually not quite sure if it's worthy of all this Oscar hype.<br/><br/>Some scenes could definitely have been more subtle, encouraging the viewer to draw his/her own conclusions. (To name an example (out of many), it's quite clear that the neighbor is gay, and has no romantic interest in the lead character. The scene where he was hitting on the bartender was unnecessary).<br/><br/>Also, too much screen time was dedicated to the villain. Yes, we do understand that he's an evil, evil man, with no respect for any living creatures, (and he has the gross habit of not washing his hands after going to the bathroom!) but these facts were rubbed in our faces over and over again.<br/><br/>Instead, I would have loved to know more about the water creature! Of course, some things about him should still have been shrouded in mystery, but for instance, it would have been delightful to see some more scenes where he and Elisa were bonding (and not in a sexual, but in a sensual way!).<br/><br/>Another thing that irked me was the fact that this film is definitely excessively gore:y. For instance, when the water creature ate the cat, why did we have to see it? You were not supposed to think he was evil for doing it, because it was clear that he didn't know that they were beloved pets (as if it wasn't clear enough, Giles even had to POINT IT OUT). There would be a million ways to tell the audience about it without actually *showing* it.<br/><br/>With this movie, Guillermo del Toro has been accused of plagiarism by multiple sources, and it's not very hard to see why. I haven't seen the play it's supposed to be based on, but the film does indeed have many visual (and musical!) similarities with Amelié (2001)--in the beginning, I was rather certain I was about to see a homage to the film in question, and I think my assumptions were correct. In short, plot-wise, this movie reminds us of things we have seen before, and it wasn't very hard to predict the ending.<br/><br/>To sum it up--I'm a little disappointed, because while it's a breathtaking visual experience (and I can't stop listening to the soundtrack, it's been on repeat since I found it on Spotify!) it comes across as a little flat, and way too shallow (no pun intended)."

","Visually it is a good film but there are two things wrong with it. First is that I left the cinema without ever learning anything about human relationships. The second is that in a well-developed story it is usual for a character to learn something and change for the better. It would have been good for one of other characters to have changed in some way.<br/><br/>It is a subtle twist on the ""beauty and the beast"" story and Elisa finds someone who she can relate to. Now I've thought about it, is that the lesson? That love works in mysterious ways? That we should let go of what society expects of us when it comes to forming romantic relationships? If it is, it didn't work as well it could have."

","Let it be awarded all the prizes in the world that people want to give it, but by the moment the Amazonian entity is taken out of the Pentagon-financed experimental hall, ""The Shape of Water"" loses much of its magic. It becomes an unnecessary brutal and violent actioner, with a touch of Hollywood silliness for good measure, as the singing-and-dancing parody of ""Cheek to Cheek"" -which by the way seems a more appropriate fantasy for Giles than Elisa. Greeks were not fools when they established the rules of tragedy: they avoided the display of gruesome details on the stage, not for aesthetic reasons, but because tragedies were neither lessons on anatomy nor autopsy tutorials. Gore sells, but in my opinion, it belongs to other kind of movies, and seems out of place in a fantasy like ""The Shape of Water"". I am thirteen years older than Guillermo del Toro, so I immediately recognized many of his faces, from Elana Eden in «The Story of Ruth» to Carmen Miranda, to describe the world of Elisa Esposito (wonderful Sally Hawkins, who merits all awards bestowed upon her). His references are also familiar to me, especially «Creature from the Black Lagoon» and its sequel «Revenge of the Creature», which precedes all those movies in which US military men and women want to get hold of all the E.T.s, Starmen and whatever weird but wonderful cross their way. For me what really counts is the love story, spiced with Cold War antics and military bullying, but even the romance goes over the top (for examples, in the second love-making scene, or the ""Cheek to Cheek"" parody) and it never recovers, since we all know the ending from the start, in the main title sequence. Production design is good, Alexander Desplat's music does not add anything to his prestige, and casting is adequate. Michael Shannon shines as usual. However Octavia Spencer, doing what is expected from her, has to deal with the stereotype of the fat and funny black woman that goes all the way back to the origins of the cinema of Los Angeles; and Richard Jenkins also plays the stereotype of the funny and old homosexual man. After watching it, I gave it four stars, then the day after it lost one... I do not think it will go any lower. It does not matter that a creature from sweet water, requires salt on its bathing tub. See it."
"jamille-59175","Null","3","5","16 February 2018"," Quite unbelievable tangle of coincidences
","Ok, we are talking about the year 1962 and let's pretend every person of that era is a naive and airhead. 
So you have a big secret government laboratory in Baltimore where our mute protagonist, Elisa (who's never dated anyone somehow because the 1960s men were douchebags and just wanted sexy blonds with no scars on their body who can moan ""Fuck me!!"" anytime) works as a janitor along with her co worker, Zelda who apparently is the only friend she has apart from her gay neighbor Giles.
So, in this secret organization where Elisa works treats all the workers as a part of the family and never hides anything which makes me ask the point of calling themselves as ""secret"" or ""classified"". Yep, any worker can freely open any door, because it seems there's no locked doors and enter to enjoy feeding some fish bread crumbs, even if that fish is a humanoid and actually gets only boiled eggs to eat from Elisa. The workers can even change the coverage of CCTV cameras by some manual manipulation to smoke or rescue an aquatic creature. And in this secret organization, the security never finds out who kidnapped their specimen but a one man army Colonel does, and that too after realizing the traitor's identity too late by a little mind pushing.
See, there's a lot of coincidences, Like you never know that a woman is in love with the lab specimen and is planning to rescue it while you are too trying to rescue it and the guard who is about to shoot our Elisa's bestie gets blacked out by you at the right time. A lot of that it plainly becomes unbelievable and heavily clichéd. You find yourself shutting your eyes or wanting to leave the hall to attend some better activity like napping.
Yes, things do look original but you also catch yourself telling yourself, ""Ha, this looks like the uncartooned version of some Disney fairytale set in modern timeline and city and not in a far away kingdom without princes or mermaids. 
The only time I got surprised was when Strickland doesn't have Elisa ""squawk"" out of her muteness anywhere throughout the screenplay after the warning which is the only good thing done in the movie for the sake of not letting viewers predict that scene. Else, I would have expected our merman to save the heroine from the clutches of the villain.
Well, the end was as disappointing as the whole screen play and completely contradicted the narration in the beginning few seconds. I was expecting the lovers to get separated to have some good forced tears rather you have our merman pronounced as ""God"" by Strickland and concluding a good blow from the merman for being called a ""God"" (jk)
And the merman takes away his beloved while consequently resurrecting her in the waters to make her become an amphibian like him (I guess) and live happily ever after, as expected by our poor guy Giles who was born too early or too late in an era were gays and blacks are discriminated against in family restaurants.
The characters were certainly poorly developed and unrealistic and too foolish. There was no powerful character throughout the movie with even the good scientist being killed. 
The movie is heavily predictable with minor surprises that don't impress you. Go for it if you never mind watching illogical Disney movies and don't respect yi=our money. Also, watch this if you'd like to know how a water creature and a human woman make love.
For real watchers who want to be impressed, give it a go for the real and short depictions of racism, LGBT issues, patriotism, humanity, great humor provided by Zelda (Spencer), how a maniac Colonel realizes that the creature he'd been torturing throughout is actually quite Godlike in the end."

There's the thudding irony: they're worse than the ""Asset."" But everything in this movie is heavy-handed, just so no the under-educated masses don't miss anything. The light touch of Hitchcock, even in his intense thrillers, is very distant from this work.<br/><br/>To return briefly to politics, I would ask how this repellent movie is different from our vulgarian president, with his personal insults, s---hole countries, and appeals to the worst in voters?

OK, it is a fairy tale, but somehow a love story between fish and a woman is quite stupid. Even the end scene won't surprise you and that is something not to expect in Guillermo del Toro's movie.<br/><br/>Sally Hawkins makes her role credibly and that with movie set is the most impressive in this movie. Set is beautiful and looks like many fantasy movies from -50's fantasy movies. Directing is good, but nothing special.

","""The Shape of Water"" is filmed by an artist but written by an immature man-child. It's a sort of ""Beauty and the Beast"" and ""Creature From the Black Lagoon"" mash up with some themes that Disney would target to an 8-year-old.<br/><br/>During the opening scenes we see a naked female masturbating in a bath tub, which would seem to indicate the movie to follow is targeted towards a mature grown up audience. Instead, we get something on the same intellectual level that can be found in a book that teachers would read to 3rd graders.<br/><br/>I guess the more liberal viewers will be ok with its portrayal of white, straight males as being the real monsters, no matter how clichéd and intellectually boring this has become. For some reason there's a heroic sidekick who seems unnecessarily gay, i.e., it serves no purpose to the plot other than to serve as a contrast to the cruel, uber-hetero alpha male and main antagonist portrayed by Michael Shannon.<br/><br/>There's just enough sex, violence, and language to get an R rating, which would have been fine in a movie with a script that was mature enough to handle it. Its a real shame the script is so puerile because it's beautifully shot and looks great. In the end its hard to imagine this being enjoyable by anyone who reads above a first grade level or has maturity beyond a thirteen-year-old who gets titillated by a naked woman in the bathtub."

Steven Spielberg chickened out in ""The Color Purple"" so my mom could tell me (at the tender age of 18, as if I didn't know lesbianism existed) when Celie and Shug Avery were kissing she could use the insipid line ""She's teaching her tenderness."" (which makes me wonder if that were some ""concerned parent"" talking point going around then because over the years I've had two other friends tell me their mom said the EXACT same thing to them about that seen) which gave short shrift to the fact that in the book, Celie and Avery became same-sex lovers. Del Toro gives us NO wiggle room here to spin the story. Love it or hate it, Amphibian Man and Sally totally got it on. Not bagging on Spielberg (too much) here, there's a world of difference in tolerance between 1985 and 2017, and the Color Purple is a great movie overall.<br/><br/>Is this a great movie? In my opinion, no. It does have flaws, but plenty of others will gleefully break them down for you. There are some GOOD critical reviews here too, though it takes a bit of wading through the righteous indignation. But unless you're totally in love with the idea that God made humans in his image, I think you can find a lot to like in this movie."

An Oscar winning film should have a riveting story line, along with intelligent subject matter. This film just doesn't have it. It was somewhat predictable. They did not need all the blood, and gore. The creature from the deep was just not a likeable thing. It is like the old Creature From The Black Lagoon on steroids. The film left a lot out and wasn't very believable. The dialog, and the personalities of the characters did not fit the time frame of this movie. It wasn't very true to life. Hence, it was not all that interesting.

","It has been a very long time since I have been physically ill at the end of a film - but that is precisely how I felt at the end of this one. How far have we come that the most promising Oscar nomination for the year has a hero whose script bleeps like a chicken sitting on an egg? The camera adds fifteen pounds to a human figure. Despite that the heroine looks anorectic and in need of medical oversight.<br/><br/>The 1950s depiction here has the unveiled focus on bigotry, power imbalance between the sexes, narcissistic overplay by both military and security services, homophobia, racial injustice, and oppression of women in marriage, in racial marriage, and in the workforce. About the only area neglected was the religious oppression of the period, surprisingly enough. The script nearly verges on satire with its lack of balance for what was of value during this period, but instead skewers it for its failings. The characters, as a result are one dimensional and stereotypical - which of course was the point.<br/><br/>There is a curious lack of power in all the figures in this film, from the security manager who is hit at both ends from his marriage or supervisors, to the gay unemployed, the research station support staff, the snack bar clerk, underworld figures, and the military oversight. The powerlessness is exaggerated and caricatured. Because the setting focuses on this lack of power and its consequent emptiness, the focus moves directly to the only sympathetic place the viewer can find of interest - which lies in the compassion between colleagues, neighbours, and for that of an abused incarcerated lab creature.<br/><br/>Given those elements in place, the rest of the film moves into the realm not only of the fanciful, but unbelievable, if absurd, and plays on the western obsession with the idea of love as romance on the most basic if basal elements of need on the physical an emotive plane. It is developed to contrast with what the only offered comparison in the film, which of course is the emptiness of the 1950s caricature of a marriage.<br/><br/>Oh please. And for this an Oscar nomination? Really? Where are we inspired? Where is the acting inspired? What is worthy in this film? Awards are given to what is outstanding. This film is anything but that. Shame on the American industry for elevating this. It is most unworthy."

","It has been a long time since I last hated my life as much while watching pictures flee by on the silver screen as I did in the screening of The Shape of Water. It begs the question, has the whole world finally gone completely mad? How is this straigh-to-dvd-quality trash one of the best rated films of the past 12 months, and how did it become the winner of the main prize in Venice?<br/><br/>For nothing about this movie feels sincere or innovative. There is so much recycling and ripping off going on here, that I can't help but wonder whether those who love it have ever seen a movie before. The storyline follows worn-out formula of fairytales, the creature is an amazingly unimaginative copy of the Creature of The Black Lagoon, and first and foremost, the feel of the movie is lifted from Amélie - a far, far better movie.<br/><br/>Very little in the movie even makes sense. How do cleaners have such an easy access to the super top secret lab where the creature is held? How is Strickland - the main villain - so bad at his work that he doesn't even suspect the cleaners for freeing the creature? And why does the movie end with such a deus ex machina solution?<br/><br/>In order for the viewer to be able to suspend their disbelief, a movie should be credible in its core machinations. The Shape of Water is anything but. Del Toro doesn't care about logic. He cares about mushy sentimentalism and nostalgic pastiche which smack of infantilism and escapism. Admittedly, his craft is seemingly of a high standard, but nothing about the visual world created here feels authentic, and the lack of authenticism makes this two-hour movie feel way overlong. Curiously, too, the movie is set on the eve of the Cuban missile crisis in the fall of 1962, but Del Toro in no way deals with the paranoia of the Cold War era. Must be because he simply is unable to. Therefore, the chosen era is irrelevant to the story.<br/><br/>Perhaps the best thing about The Shape of Water is its talented cast, but even the actors feel competent rather than inspired. Sally Hawkins is a fantastic actress, but just because she's able to perform without dialogue shouldn't grant an Oscar nomination. Octavia Spencer is fine as ever, but nothing we haven't seen from her before. Same goes for Richard Jenkins and Michael Shannon, although the latter is admirably intense. Michael Stuhlbarg might be the actor who feels most sincere here.<br/><br/>I don't know... This whole film feels like a lie, and hate it quite intensely. There are sparks here and there, a promising line of dialogue comes every so often, but all in all Del Toro seems to think we, his audience, are children. And, for the most part, the audience reaction has been childish. Shame on us, then."

The film overuses the color green everywhere to the point where you'll want a vacation from green. They casted the guy (Michael Shannon) who said ""I WILL FIND HIM"" in an overdramatic fashion too many times in Man of Steel. They gave Octavia Spencer some verrrry stereotypical lines for her character. If none of that is enough to turn you off, maybe the horizontal mambo scene between Elisa and the fish guy will.

","I can't believe this movie was nominated for awards and even won some. Just shows how bad movies have gotten. This film was very mediocre and not worthy of all the praise. First, it is too silly and the plot is just so simplistic. It's about a mute lady, Elisa, whom works as a cleaner at a govenment facility. She finds this sea creature/aquatic man that is being held there. Sadistic investigator, Richard, tortures the creature trying to find out it's capabilites. Elisa sees this and starts bringing it food and befriending it. She decides to kidnapp the creature before it is killed. With help from a couple of friends, her plan works. At home, she falls in love with it, sleeps with it, and floods her bathroom. This part is the silliest of all scenes. Of course, she must avoid Richard until she can release the creature. And the ending is just awful, makes no sense. (spoiler), Richard shoots her and creature, the creature expels the bullets, and jumps in the water with Elisa and I guess they just swim off together to be happily ever after?? Not sure how Elisa breathes underwater.<br/><br/>FINAL VERDICT: No way is this a good, award worthy film. Just shows how the poor quality coming out of Hollywood nowdays. Not worth seeing."

"rickh98","7","2","3","15 August 2018"," Best Picture was generous... but it's a decent film nonetheless
","Guillermo del Toro leads us on a beautifully compelling, and oddly romantic story about a woman and a fish who fall in love.<br/><br/>The film opens underwater, and although the later scenes do not, the set design and lighting makes us feel like we never really surface. deep Blues and swampy greens paint the film, everything I remember is shaded with these colours, it is a director which such a fine control over colour palettes I think Wes Anderson will probably feel a little outdone.<br/><br/>Then we meet Elisa, we follow her through her morning routine, she likes eggs, is sexually frustrated, and she can't speak, she's a mute. Sally Hawkins teases life into Elisa, she could easily have played her as straight up quiet, introverted and shy, but there's so much more to her. In one scene she signs ""F*** You"" to Michael Shannon's character, for no other reason than her own enjoyment, she gives a smug little grin after doing it too. I like to imagine Sally Hawkins receiving a script from Guillermo del Toro thinking ""brilliant, finally my chance to win an Oscar"", only to open up the screenplay and realise all her lines are effectively facial expressions. She does brilliantly regardless.<br/><br/>The film is well paced, but the blossoming romance between Elisa and Cpt Fish Finger is put rather dumbly into a montage. We don't spend enough real time with the pair as they begin to fall in love. For example by the film's half way point, Elisa is planning to break Fish Cake out of the research facility, effectively risking her life for him, but all we've seen up to this point is them eating eggs together and him watching her dance with some weird French music playing over the top. I saw no real motive for her to risk her life at this point. I wanted to see real scenes between the two of them; how do you fall in love with a frog looking guy you can't really talk to? I guess even Del Toro was unsure on that one, he skipped over the answer.<br/><br/>The film's most redeeming quality is in it's character's. Richard Jenkins' character stood out, he is quirky and oddly magnetic, I wanted to see more of him. He got nominated for Best Supporting Actor because Sally Hawkins relied on his humour and daintiness to paint and strengthen her character. Michael Shannon as well plays a baddie straight out of the Del Toro's school of baddies, he's always sucking hard boiled sweets, his fingers bleed and get progressively darker as his character does. No character is alike. Everyone is brought to life brilliantly by the actor playing them. Octavia Spencer plays every role she ever has played, mouthy, sassy black woman - but she plays it well I wont protest.<br/><br/>Allow yourself to fall into the trance Del Toro has created. Don't resist. It's odd and quirky and if you spend your time questioning that, the film will pass over you."

"owanitall","7","2","3","27 February 2018"," A visual poem I would have liked more if I could stay with it
","Artistically this film is fantastic. Every space is like its own character with its own mood and atmosphere. A lot of it has to do with light, whether it's the dimly lit hallway of Elisa's apartment, her bus rides in the twighlight, or harsh fluorescent lighting of the laboratory. This is the world in which the characters dwell. Outcasts of society - a mute woman, a gay man, an African American woman (to an extent), and a merman like creature - they find friendship and support and love in each other. <br/><br/>The movie is a love story and a little bit of a thriller and a visual poem. But I feel that in order to fully appreciate it one needed to be fully immersed, and I kept getting thrown out. One problem was that as a native Russian speaker I found Michael Stuhlbarg's Russian hilarious and thus distracting. I also thought the whole Russian story line was rather wobbly, like it was there just to serve a purpose. Another element that felt contrived was the presence of three scars on Elisa's neck. The explanation they offered accounted for one scar, the other two seemed to be there for the sole purpose of being transformed at the end. The relationship between Elisa and the creature was beautiful, but I had to squash my queasiness when it went sexual. I mean, yes, he was intelligent and sensitive, and could sit at the table like a person eating his beloved eggs, but he wasn't human. Was it really necessary? And lastly, maybe that's just me and my dislike of gore, but was the last scene with the fingers necessary?<br/><br/>The ending was really beautiful. I just wish I could stay with the film the whole time."

So, one star flies away because of the bad feeling it caused me since the beginning and we're left with nine stars. The next thing that bothered me was that it lacked some kind of cohesion. I got dizzy after some time and didn't know if I was watching a soap opera or an actual drama, as it was supposed to be. So, nine minus one equals eight. Last but not least, the replicas were pretty poor, in my view, causing lack of interest for me. Seven is my grade, in the end.

","The Shape of Water: Directed by Guillermo Del Toro and written by Guillermo Del Toro and Vanessa Taylor<br/><br/>This is the love story between a mute cleaning lady and a fish man from the Amazon who looks an awful lot like Abe Sapien from Hellboy. Everything is incredibly stylized in a 1950s movie. The presence of Creature from the Black Lagoon especially its later sequels wash over every blue tinted frame of the movie. This is coming from director Guillermo Del Toro which means the visuals are something else. They are magical and magnificent and unique. It has that blue tinge to it. It feels like the camera lens is viewing things through water itself. It makes sense. Crimson Peak was steeped in shades of red. Most of his movies have this color theme to the visuals. <br/><br/>This is a bizarre movie. The two main characters don't speak so everything is in their body language. It makes getting completely involved in their romance, however unconventional it is, difficult to do. IT takes their relationship to the absolute extreme. It is exactly what you're thinking and this movie was just nominated for a best picture Oscar. A movie about a mute lady having a romance with a fish man sexual and all is nominated for a best picture Oscar. Think about that for a second. <br/><br/>It was never dull.

Largely due to the mechanics and logistics of the story elements. This facility had terrible security across the board. Cameras everywhere except that lab? Cleaning crews can go anywhere?

Many times movies will take a ""leap of faith"" in the story elements in order to move the train along. But there were far too many in this.<br/><br/>The love story fell flat early on as I only felt it after the creature was taken to the apartment. Filling the bathroom with water looked very good but ended up being a very silly act.<br/><br/>Even the initial introduction of the creature in the tank behind the woman was farted out. You let the audience see the creature right when the woman does in order the accentuate the shock factor.<br/><br/>It was a bad decision for the creature to eat the cat. That made it an animal and mitigated compassion for it. Strangely it touted the ""animal"" aspect of the creature right after.<br/><br/>After the creature scratched the woman's friend, I immediately knew that the marks on the woman's neck was more than just scratches.

There was no real chemistry between the fish-man and the mute gal and the romance felt rushed. Also, the masturbation scenes did nothing to further the plot and seemed counterproductive to the ""good message"" which was that the fish-man loved the girl despite her differences. To me, it came across that she was overly sexual and needed someone (thing) that could love her to fulfill her sexual needs... not because deep down she wanted to be loved despite her physical disability (even though that seems to be what the film wanted to portray). <br/><br/>Overall don't waste your money on this.

The first scene when Elisa was in the bathroom, in opinion didn't add anything to the story. The nudity had nothing to do with it neither what she was doing but I felt like it was there just to be there.
What I really found wrong was the way Elisa approached the creature. She had just witnessed Strickland having his two fingers cut of clearly by the creature, but she decided to go and sit at the edge of the tank and have a small interaction with it when it good very easily kill her.
One thing that I really didn't like was the fact that it progressed really quickly, from the moment they brought the water creature until the decision to kill it. I would love to see more of their building relationship and how Elisa found ways to approach it .
A few more things that bothered are: 1 when her friend went to the pie shop and he said to the man that worked there "" I would like to know you better"" and the man said "" Get yours hands off of me old man"" and literally a moment after that it shows how he is also a racist on top of homophobic, which was so poorly shown if not unnecessary scene . 2 When the creature gets out of Elisa's house. When Elisa finds it, it is in the theater watching a movie when nobody else is there..... I mean why would a movie play if nobody is watching. and 3 when Elisa is watching the creature eating eggs and she is imagining singing and dancing with it. I have to say that I found it absolutely ridiculous.<br/><br/>The ending was just cheesy I will say nothing more<br/><br/>But in all honesty Sally Hawkins played her role beautifully. She is an incomplete person and you can clearly see it I also really liked the relationship she had with her best friend. Even though they were both incomplete they had found ways to make each other forget it for a while.<br/><br/>Over all the message and the acting were really good and remarkable but the whole story was badly executed hence the 4 stars."

Visually beautiful, well acted and captured the early 60's/cold war pretty well.<br/><br/>Yes nice shots and cinematography. The acting was great, especially from the main actress Sally Hawkins. Watching it one feels like they are experiencing the era. <br/><br/>Cons:
Plot holes abound, dumb story, dumb characters, pointless character threads and a weird/silly premise.<br/><br/>The biggest problem is the pointless character threads and dumb characters. For example the neighbor is gay and is shown hitting on a man who reacts poorly to his advances, I am fine with this if it furthers the story but it does not in any way. All the sudden the main character is apparently part what ever the creature is at the end with little hints and no explanation.<br/><br/>The characters are dumb, why isn't the creature always chained? Security seems lax, there should be an armed guard stationed in the room at all times, also there are no cameras in the room? <br/><br/>While this is not a bad movie by any measure, it is certainly not great. This movie did not deserve best picture, there are better movies that came out in 2017. Below average movie overall."

"TheNabOwnzz","3","5","12","29 April 2018"," Typical 2017 political propaganda with little artistic value
","Not much else is new, yet another left wing propaganda film that focuses on its political message rather than actual artistic value which is what film should be about. It is an unfortunate turn of events after Guillermo del Toro seemed to be such a promising director after his masterpiece Pan's Labyrinth (2006).<br/><br/>If nothing else, it is a very stylish and beautiful film. One of my complaints about a lot of modern movies is also the fact that most of them are ugly as can be, but this is not one of them. It is colorful, stylish and has beautiful cinematography. Yet i wish del Toro would try something else than the hip height camera stance and the constant moving around of the camera without having any kind of major reveal, it just makes it seem pointless. The score by Alexandre Desplat was also very good.<br/><br/>Unfortunately all the good points end here. For a story about morals or a psychological intelligent kind of film we are obviously in the wrong place here. For one, lets analyze the main characters: A mute woman, a gay man, a black woman, and the evil white guy. Such an obvious lazy political message that has ruined filmmaking as it is today . We get that the white straight man is the enemy now, Hollywood, you might as well leave these kind of dumb messages out of your films, turning it into a bunch of socially pretentious garbage.<br/><br/>It is a movie partly ruined by its irrelevant social message, yet the script and the dialogue also leave something to be desired. Conversations between the white bad guy and Hoyt borderline on the comical, that's how terrible they are. Lines like 'i do not fail' and 'i deliver', 'You are a God' also come off as extreme cringeworthy. The script goes too fast for the romance to feel anything like it isn't forced, which is exactly what it feels like now. The mute woman sees the captured animal and is somehow immediately in love because like her he cannot talk? Very convincing stuff. Unfortunately the entire romance is just another irrelevant political message ( mute woman and captured animal ) about the weak overcoming the strong. Regardless of whether or not you share these ideals, this is not what a movie should be about. But as a pure artistic milestone, del Toro fails on every aspect except cinematography.<br/><br/>In the end what we have here is nothing new. Yet another modern film with the depth of a peanut and irrelevant political messages. A shame such a promising director has been downgraded to this."

I love Del Toro, I will always love him, but was this movie Oscar-worthy? I can't tell. Maybe not..<br/><br/>Richard Jenkins shines, as always. He is slowly becoming one of my favorite actors in Hollywood. Can't remember a role he's played in the last five years in which he wasn't brilliant. Even in Cabin in the Woods. <br/><br/>I don't know, I can't really put my finger on what it exactly was about this movie that I found repelling and not entirely satisfactory. I guess I wish there hasn't been a human-fish sexual encounter, it made it a bit awkward. But the scene when they do it, and Elisa fills the whole bathroom with water to the point of leaking is mesmerizing. I always wanted to do that.

We've seen the same scenario in movies as diverse as 'Splash' and 'Free Willy' to name but two. I don't think that story line has been treated as originally as it has been here though.

","How incredibly sad that almost every user rating The Shape of Water on IMDB seems to have totally missed what the nature of the film is. It is a cross between a fairy tale, that much loved genre of del Toro, and homage to the ability of cinema both to express such fairy tales and to enhance the life of our imagination by doing so. It is a hugely metacinematic and intertextual exercise, with every scene and every theme alluding to something from the history of cinema, the black and white scene where the mute Eliza breaks into song and dance with the ""asset"" being the culmination of such cinematic homage. The movie is not literal, and a literal reading of it is puerile and dishonest. In cinematic story telling anything is possible: two loners like Eliza and Giles can share genuine friendship and a household. Dimitri the evil Russian is the one who appreciates and wants to save the ""asset"", the almighty all American power guy Strickland rots away at the severed and surgically reattached fingers, while the ""asset"", far from being a monster from the black lagoon, is actually a healer. And the marks on Elisa's neck since childhood are nothing other than a suggestion of her true destiny, to develop gills and live happily ever after in her water world with the ""asset"". There's a million other images I could go into. The colour green/teal distinction, the ever presence of water in every form, the contrast between little people like the cleaning women and the powerful men they work for etc etc. Go watch this movie with your heart open and your prejudices at bay. Let a little of the sublime in it spill over into your life. Off to watch it again."

But it sure looked nice am i right?<br/><br/>Tonight I got around to watch ""The Shape of Water"", a movie I thought would be more akin to ""Pan's Labyrinth"" than GDT masterpieces like, lets say.. erm, Pacific Rim...
Whilst I still hold PL to be in a league of its own I really enjoyed this one. A timepiece with lots of nice details, music and beautiful scenery with great art directing (like all of GDT films).<br/><br/>A great small cast that drove the story forward, simply and not over the top, on just a few set locations that it almost felt like watching a play in the theater. Ironic thinking the main protagonists apartment is just above a local cinema.<br/><br/>Sure there were some things for the nitpicker (Like how did Zelda just look at Elisa smiling and conclude that she slept with the thing AND not get really freaked out by it?) but overall I really liked it and it created a mood worth revisiting even though some things were left wanting.<br/><br/>I don't really understand the hate on here and it is definitely not a snob movie just a well directed and well told story that follows a simple structure from start to finish. Raise your standards people and appreciate a movie that doesn't take you for a fool.<br/><br/>I solely went in to watch this movie because I was curious and trusting in the fact that Guillermo has the ability to create wonderful stories if he wants too.

Well, what a disappointment. Premise may be satisfying, but everything else is terrific. Atmosphere that starts to build up from the beginning of the film is constantly shattered by cheap symbolism and something that I could call ""not going with it all the way through"". Obviously, the movie is one that holds a purpose of disturbing feelings with good storytelling and aesthetics - unfortunately, it lacks in both of these areas. Components lead nowhere and keep viewer wondering why they were placed here in the first place. Scenes are either not disturbing enough or not beautiful enough. The fact that these little things ruin something potentially good and precious, well, is very sad. I don't know why this film is so widely appreciated - there's nothing special, nothing disturbing and nothing magnificent about it.
If you want to watch something with similar dystopian-ish atmosphere and aesthetics, better spend your time on La Antenna (2007). It doesn't contain any monster-loving, but it is a good example of dystopian fairy tale like story."

This movie should be taught in film school under subject ""How NOT to make a movie"". But everything in order. I'll start with positive aspects, of which I could have found just three: the acting, it's outstanding; music which is superb and Octavia Spencer who was the only one who didn't irritate so much. The rest though....
As I said earlier this movie was destined to win an Oscar from the very beginning. How could it not have won? It's got every possible kind of person who you can oppress: a mute woman, a black overweight woman, an old gay man, an extraterrestrial with a chain on his neck, bad russians. Everyone in this movie is being oppressed by the big boss - ""the bad guy"" who was portrayed mostly by Michael Shannon. He was not irritating in the first half of the movie but then it went straight downhill. Motivation? Never heard of it. Why am I so bad, you say? Because the plot says so. Six minutes of the movie and you're already know what you're going to get it the end, but I gave it a chance and regreted it. Worst best picture ever."
"zkonedog","6","4","9","18 March 2018"," Very Well Made, But Lacked A Real Message
","After seeing ""The Shape of Water"" take home the Best Picture award at the latest Oscars ceremony, I wanted to see what the buzz was about (I had been meaning to watch it before-hand but never quite got around to it). After viewing, what I found was that while the film was clearly very well-made, it seemed to lack a solid message to give it real purpose.<br/><br/>For a basic plot summary, ""Shape of Water"" primarily focuses on Elisa (Sally Hawkins), a mute woman who works as a janitor at a government research facility in 1962. One day, a strange fish-like creature (Doug Jones) is brought onto the premises to be poked, prodded, and otherwise tortured while the U.S. government continues to try and keep one step ahead of the Cold War with the Soviet Union. Elisa takes a more sympathetic approach with the new creature, however, and discovers that she must try and rescue it from whatever Richard Strickland (Michael Shannon), the leader of the facility, has in store for it.<br/><br/>As I mentioned, technically this is a very sound film. The cinematography is always beautiful, the pacing is excellent (it never feels rushed or boring), and the acting is great throughout the whole thing. Belying what on the outside looks like it could be quite a convoluted, supernatural tale, ""Shape of Water"" is actually a very simple film that most viewers will be able to follow quite easily. This is why I can't go any lower than 6/10 stars, as it deserves at least that ranking.<br/><br/>That being said, I also felt that this was almost so simple of a film as to be a little pointless sometimes. It never really surprised me in the direction it would go, and there were certain plot threads (like what exactly this aquamarine creature and where did it come from?) that I felt could have been expounded on instead of others. Clearly, the intent here was to create a very simple love story out of a very complicated set of circumstances, and that isn't necessarily my favorite type of filmmaking. In short, I wanted more backstory/information than what I ultimately received from the viewing experience.<br/><br/>So, while this would never be my ""best picture"" of anything, I can indeed see why it garnered so much Hollywood praise. It's exceptionally well-made, harkens back to old-Hollywood at times, and is very much a simple tale told at a time when such tales are looked upon favorably. It is also a film that can be enjoyed by large swaths of viewers, so that is a big plus as well. It's worth a watch if you are intrigued, but perhaps won't measure up to expectations if you are looking for more in-depth storytelling out of it."
"stebird","6","4","9","26 January 2018"," Oscar-bait
","You cannot hide its many flaws, sure ""The Shape of Water"" is a cinematic marvel, beautifully shot and brilliantly made, but it screams of Oscar-bait, how much do you want to bet that this film will scoop up at least over half a dozen Oscars at the Academy Awards? <br/><br/>It's unoriginal, just a retelling of Beauty and the Beast, only under different circumstances and a completely different context..., it is a good film, but I refuse to be drawn into it and jump on the hype band wagon. <br/><br/>What was a wonderful part of the film as a whole was Sally Hawkins mute character, the fact that she cannot speak adds another dimension to the story not to mention the romance aspect. Normally acting without being given the ability to speak is a rather daunting prospect, it evokes memories of the old silent films when actors couldn't speak, but Hawkins does a grand job making Elisa empathetic and believable, well done her.<br/><br/>The other cast members were neither here nor there..., Octavia Spencer was given a supporting role that was always guaranteed to land her a Best Supporting Actress nomination (Oscar-bait once again), but in my opinion she hardly did anything noteworthy that makes her deserved of that nomination. <br/><br/>It's becoming more and more apparent that top films are gradually turning to Sci-Fi and Fantasy, utilizing at least some of those genres tropes to make the films more appealing and attractive to the changing cinema audience, suddenly Sci-fi, Fantasy, Superhero and Comic Book genres are all mainstream, whereas in the past only 'geeks' and 'losers' were attracted to them..., how the world changes...<br/><br/>Guillermo Del Toro is an amazingly talented film maker and he has truly shown his worth with ""The Shape of Water"", it's a dang shame that I couldn't take to it like so many people have."

","Guillermo del Toro's 'The Shape of Water' is visually dazzling & impeccably acted by Sally Hawkins. And sadly enough, its also predictable. While there is much to admire here, especially its technical aspects, its also a bit underwhelming how one can predict the entire film ahead. But del Toro is in form here and that enough makes up for its flaws.<br/><br/>'The Shape of Water' synopsis: In a 1960s research facility, a mute janitor (Sally Hawkins) forms a relationship with an aquatic creature (Doug Jones).<br/><br/>'The Shape of Water' is del Toro's love letter to cinema, as he said, so there is a beautiful Broadway dance here, along-with a love-story that tugs your heartstrings. There is genuine romance here between the mute woman & the aquatic creature. del Toro makes sure he keeps the narrative like a fantasy & the beauty remains intact in its characters & in the water.<br/><br/>On the downside, is a tiresomely one-note villain, played by Michael Shannon, the wicked Colonel who tortures the Creature, even after he gets two of his fingers ripped apart. The antagonist is predictably a racist & misogynist, who only lives by orders & has no heart to speak of. del Toro tries to make Shannon's bad-guy human, but he barely remains anything but a regular villain in a film where you're suppose to be on the creature's side. And it doesn't help that Shannon, an otherwise brilliant actor, goes over-the-top.<br/><br/>Another minus in this beautiful looking motion-picture, is the predictable story-line. You know where this is headed right from the word GO. And while some of it is genuinely interesting & offers heart, there is no denying its clichÃ©d form. And the strong violence puts you off after a point.<br/><br/>And despite the minuses that cannot be overlooked, the pluses still remain unmistakably powerful. del Toro's Direction is dreamlike & takes us into its world of picturesque beauty & gruesome violence. del Toro is in his element here & proves once again that he's among the most passionate filmmakers of our times, despite none of his films being perfect. <br/><br/>Dan Laustse's Magnificent Cinematography, Alexandre Desplat's enchanting Score, Sidney Wolinsky's nicely done Editing, along-with extraordinary work on the Art & Costume Design, only add to the narrative's merits.<br/><br/>Performance-Wise: Sally Hawkins is engrossing in her portrayal of the mute protagonist, who falls in love with a creature. Hawkins is pure heart & soul, fleshed out in a sublime performance. Hawkins leads 'The Shape of Water' with her astounding performance. Expect strong Oscar chase! Of the rest of the cast, Doug Jones does a splendid job as the creature. Richard Jenkins as Hawkins' neighbor, as always, is perfect. Octavia Spencer raises the best laughs as Hawkins' co-worker & friend, while Michael Stuhlbarg excels as a doctor who believes in freeing the creature from the sadists around him. <br/><br/>On the whole, 'The Shape of Water' isn't perfect, but there's no denying its beauty or its strong leading woman."

","The movie is well made, cinematography, actors, cameras, special effects, sound, editing, everything is wonderful. Except there's a creature here that is not human, and a woman who falls in love with it, has sex with it (or at least kind of tries, since it is not human it's hard to tell). There's a point where the movie turns really weird and uncomfortable.
I've been thinking, there are a lot of movies with non-human characters who fall in love with humans and it's not remotely weird, in fact, it's nice and romantic. Take Guardians of the Galaxy with starlord and gamorra, or Avatar... but they are all human-like. The thing with this movie is that the creature is very animal-like. It reminds you of a dog. It feels, it learns, it tilts its head when curious, you see it suffering and you feel bad, it hunts and eats a house cat because it's a wild animal. So seeing the woman dancing naked with it gets extremely weird. You loose the point of it all. Is it a movie against bullying? Against racism? Against animal abuse? About love? About feminism? About strange relationships? The only thing I liked and I thought was very well achieved was the bad guy. The actor does a great job at getting you to hate him. The rest of the movie was a big WTF. I really don't understand why they gave it an Oscar."
"AlexandraJensen","6","3","6","16 November 2018"," The more I thought about it, the more I disliked it
","Guillermo is a talented director...but I saw little of his style in this film. I am used to that unsettling feeling that comes watching one of his films, but this was a different type of unsetting. It felt that it was shocking for shocking's sake, and as much as I tried to hold on to the theme of being an outcast....it really difficult to connect with any character.<br/><br/>I give it 6/10 because it was enjoyable to watch in the moment, plus other pleasantries, such as Michael Shannon and some lovely cinematography."
"anthonygiancola24","6","3","6","20 July 2018"," Yeah it's Ok.
","So, I see more and more a lot of people dismiss this film because of its politics, pacing, or the fish sex. I think that all these really come from people expecting everything to be explained and believable and no ""dream logic"" allowed. Which is a problem of another sort, but just in case you were confused by some of the more vitriolic comments, that's where that's from. <br/><br/>The movie itself is...ok. It's not great, it's not terrible. If you're wondering how the film won best picture, it's because of an arbitrary point system the academy has that every year since it's installment has resulted in mediocre movies winning best picture. <br/><br/>My biggest problem with the movie is that everything feels on autopilot. The story is autopilot (it's any number of fairy tales), the characters are autopilot (meek woman, doe eyed monster, crazy scientist), and all the actors are on autopilot. <br/><br/>Octavia Spencer is playing the same character she always plays, Michael Shannon is playing the same character he always plays, Richard Jenkins is playing the same character he always plays, even Doug Jones is the one underneath all the makeup. <br/><br/>The only one who seems to escape this is Sally Hawkins who is legitimately great, but that's nothing new.<br/><br/>There's nothing standout or special about the movie, it's pretty standard. Not a bad time to be had if you're curious, but don't expect an earth shattering experience."

"parry_na","8","3","6","4 July 2018"," A terrific and typical del Torro fairytale
","Michael Shannon, who starred recently in the terrific 'Can't Come Out to Play (2013)' plays Richard Strickland, gammy-handed Colonel in charge of studying 'the asset', a lone fish-creature held in captivity by the US government. Sally Hawkins plays Elisa, a mute woman who, alongside Zelda (Octavia Spencer) works as a cleaner for the project. Her next door neighbour is Giles, struggling homosexual artist (Richard Jenkins, Chicory from 2015's 'Bone Tomahawk'). I mention his sexuality, because alongside Elisa and African-American Zelda, these people are somewhat outcast in Baltimore, 1962, where this film is set. All except Strickland, of course, who is fully accepted and acceptable, a respectable military man - cruel, arrogant and 'decent': apart from his injured hand, of course.<br/><br/>Strickland was bitten by the humanoid amphibian creature known as 'the asset', in this acclaimed Guillermo del Toro directed (and co-written) partial reimagining of 'Creature from the Black Lagoon.' It is hugely cinematic, beautifully shot, exquisitely acted and in places, strangely moving in the way that monster/human love affairs have occasionally been over the decades. Unfortunately, the sentimentality goes overboard on a number of occasions and squashes the appeal of the fragile relationship between the unappreciated mute girl and the abused creature.<br/><br/>Satisfyingly though, there is no doubt that the 'system', the 'establishment' is entirely corrupt and that the higher up the proverbial ladder, the more brazenly deceitful the officials have become. As in the best traditions of horror, the unsightly creature is the one we all route for, whilst those who have given themselves the responsibility of hierarchy are, to quote Doctor Who, decadent, degenerate and rotten to the core. And how do our heroes attempt to thwart the nastiness around them? They escape, they run away. Ah, would that we could all do that ...<br/><br/>This is a terrific and typical del Torro fairytale, child-like and affecting, with only the occasional sex-scene or moment of graphic horror violence to make the children audience members wince. It's a long 'un at just over two hours, but such is the spectacle, it never outstays its welcome. Lovely."
"jrarichards","8","3","6","1 July 2018"," Atmospheric take on early-1960s America, with an aquatic ""monster"" thrown in
","Most likely you're going to be needing 123 minutes - if not a whole lot longer - to work out if there's anything great about Guillermo del Toro's ""The Shape of Water"". <br/><br/>But I gave the film that much time and ultimately choose not to regret that.<br/><br/>Remember ""The Creature from the Black Lagoon""? That 1954 movie in which an expedition up the Amazon encounters said creature, which at one point cavorts aquatically with (an unknowing) Kay Lawrence as portrayed by a pretty good-looking Julie Adams in a swimsuit (as well as by her stunt double Ginger Stanley)?<br/><br/>Well fast-forward to 2017 (or slow-forward to 1962 in the movie's own terms) and that creature is back, captured, enchained and being looked upon as a potential ""asset"" for the US military that the Reds (who REALLY ARE under American beds, as well as in Cuba) would also like to get their hands on, or at least spirit away from the Yanks. <br/><br/>But gone is that pretty gorgeous Julie Adams, and in her place Sally Hawkins as Elisa Esposito - a cleaner at the Baltimore-based research facility that's carrying out research (aka torture) on ""The Beast"". Now the film is ostensibly steadfast in reminding us that there is no ""Beauty"" to match with that, as Elisa is (made to seem) plain and dowdy, lacking male company (other than the apartment-sharing fatherlike-figure called ""Giles"" (played by Richard Jenkins) who emerges as repressed-gay), and she's also mute! <br/><br/>Yet, in the first of many strong-contrast elements that this film throws at us - from the very first scene(!) - Elisa goes home and reveals (several times) a sensuous-enough body, and it is made clear to us in no uncertain terms that Elisa has a determined (and increasingly imaginitive) interest in matters (hetero)sexual, up to and including inter-species! <br/><br/>This is something refreshing in a movie, and the makers allow Hawkins to make an impression with it, though the boundaries of good taste are several times being probed.<br/><br/>Indeed, whimsical as this piece may at times seem, this is no kiddy-flick whatsoever, but actually grim, gory and upsetting in several places. <br/><br/>This begs a strong question as to who this film is for, and answers come there few. Nevertheless, ""The Shape of Water"" resembles a slew of recent films in regarding the early 60s as now-fair game for ""historical"" movie-making, and no expense is spared here to portray the several different worlds converging that America of that era represented. First recall how it had been in January 1961 that outgoing President Dwight Eisenhower had warned against the military-industrial complex ... only for that complex to seem so very much needed just a year later in the context of Cuba. <br/><br/>Here the military-industrial complex dominates the film as Elisa works for it, as does her colleague Zelda (in another classy performance from Octavia Spencer that again sees her up against scientist guys in white coats, or short-sleeved white shirts with badges hanging from the pockets, as well as guys in sharp suits and Sinatra-type hats who are basically secret agents - as exemplified by Michael Shannon's character Richard Strickland. <br/><br/>Now Elisa and Zelda are good people, if poor-ish, and they live in surroundings that owe more to the '40s than the '60s. Elisa gets what joy she can from the fantasy musicals that play in the cinema beneath her apartment. In contrast, bad-guy Strickland and his family live in the bright, shiny, heavily-advertised world that is promised to all of America, but is actually available to his kind, as when he enters an automobile showroom and drives off straight away in a teal-coloured Cadillac. <br/><br/>And that, in a nutshell, is this movie's actually-controversial and subversive and accurate-looking portrayal of the apparent wealth and clean-cut, all American joys of the 1960s, as laced with the fake world of Hollywood, a good dose of hypocrisy of other kinds on many levels, the arms race, the threat of the bomb and the red menace, and the scarcely-suppressed evil and gainsaying of liberty that the military-industrial complex, CIA and so on were able to generate against that background. In short, many of the same extremely-contrasting elements and aspects that one can find described tellingly (if also wittily) in a book like Bill Bryson's much-to-be-recommended ""The LIfe and Times of the Thunderbolt Kid"". <br/><br/>If you buy into that kind of multi-stranded world of a 1960s America not at all what it seems to be on the surface, you may end up seeing more here than just a lame-ish monster movie; instead finding something at once chilling and atmospheric and far more authentic then it ostensibly purports to be."

","I might be accused of not telling the poetry inside this movie but apart from the parallelism between the ""diversity"" and racism (both disgusting...the scene in the bar where some customers cannot sit is simply striking), I did not find anything beautiful in this (I think) largely overrated movie. Del Toro had done better. Lagoon monsters and 50's tech plus some dreamy scene doesn't build a movie. Shape of Water sometimes also drift to involuntary ridiculous situations that (in my opinion) could have been avoided. Bottom line: there is better out there."
"belomestnykh","5","3","6","24 February 2018"," The middle ground.
","This movie is ok. I mean ok as not a masterpiece, but not that awful either. The problem is that I was actively reminding myself every 5-10 minutes ""It's just a fairytale, let it be"". There are so many moments in this film that require you to ""let it be"" that it turns into a movie that needs you to know its a movie to work. Yeah, their love is fine, but Elisa jumps from level 2 of curiosity to level 9 of love in a heartbeat and no, it doesn't work even in fairytales.<br/><br/>Everything is ok with this movie, the only question I have (and honestly would love someone to explain it to me) is: Why did they wait for the channel to rise instead of just driving this creature to the ocean themselves?"
"alecalbury","7","3","6","19 February 2018"," A few big problems (Contains very slight spoilers)
","Yes, everything you've heard about this film is true, it's gorgeous, well acted, well written, entertaining and provides a lot to sink your teeth into in terms of symbolism and themes... but there's a few big problems I had with it...<br/><br/>For me, the central romantic relationship was silly, I never bought into it. It almost felt rushed to me, like the writers didn't believe it either. Girl meets fish monster, girl instantly falls for fish monster even though it is rather terrifying and has already maimed someone, girl gives rather tacked on reason for her feelings etc. Personally it wasn't enough to buy this rather strange coupling of souls, unless you're easily pleased in films I suppose.<br/><br/>Which leads onto my other problem with the film. Had this film been longer it really could have taken the time to add more depth and exposition to the loneliness everyone supposedly feels and Elisa's past so their motivations and actions made sense... it really felt a bit rushed throughout and I really wasn't as emotionally invested like everyone else claims they were. If you were to compare the portrayal of loneliness in this film to the likes of a film such as Moon... Moon has a much bigger impact, but then Del Toro crams a heck of a lot more into this film. <br/><br/>On top of all this I found it very hard to believe some of the events in the film because of some annoying plot holes (the poor security in the supposed 'high security' facility being the most jarring). The film was never more than a delightful romp, rather than the high art some people are labelling it.<br/><br/>I realise my review is quite negative but overall the film really is a lot of fun. It was never boring, it was funny, the set design and cinematography is astonishing, the acting is top notch, the story is good fun if rather hackneyed and there's a lot to take from it, but overall the film never reached the heights of Pan's Labyrinth or Devil's Backbone, because it never took itself seriously and remained very much a simple fairy tale, rather than the dramatic masterpiece I was hoping it would be. <br/><br/>4/5 <br/><br/>Side note : I have noticed a lot of critics praise films very highly when they reference many other films so this may be where the gushing of love for this film has come from."

You know from about the first five minutes that the bad guy is going to get it in the end. Still, a well-told tale, and the means to the inevitable end was less predictable. And some clever social commentary worked in for good measure. Worth watching, but not Best Picture material."

","To be honest, the whole premise of a love story between a woman and some weird merman seemed unattractive to me to begin with, but the Oscars did their advertising job in the end. And my intuition did not fail, Shape of Water is boring, weird, and overly-sweet all at the same time.<br/><br/>To start with the good things - visually it's well-filmed and the 60's are stylishly presented. It's nothing ground-breaking, but overall solid. The second good aspect are the actors, everyone plays their roles convincingly. I would point out Michael Shannon in particular, he proved that he can be a great antagonist before, and he's done it again, I was actually rooting for his character throughout.<br/><br/>However, the story is a dull bizarre mess. To begin with, it is overwhelmingly unoriginal - the sheepish sugar-sweet lonely protagonist, the captive creature that is tortured instead of being communicated with, the army man antagonist. The movie is just a drag, and everything is as predictable as it can be.<br/><br/>Now I can buy the ancient overused trope about the protagonist empathizing to some captive intelligent creature, but explicitly having sex with it? And yeah, there's actually plenty of unnecessary nudity (Shannon shags his wife. Ok.) and allusions to the creature's penis. Well, whatever gets you that Oscar, I guess. I mean I'm no prune, but in my opinion nudity is justified when it helps to convey some point and flesh out the story, not visualize someone's sick fantasies. Sorry, but my suspension of disbelief just doesn't cover the ""woman gets turned on by slippery scaly aquatic monster"" thing.<br/><br/>To add to that, there's an absolutely redundant meaningless side plot about a gay old man failing to get together with another dude, and a couple of scenes dedicated to showing that Shannon's character has a sexual fetish for silence. That's when you thought this movie couldn' get any more creepy.<br/><br/>And since we're at it, I would really question how realistic it is that some random cleaners are allowed access to classified assets in a top-secret research facility. There's also an uncomfortably stereotypical black woman who grossly overcompensates for the muteness of the main character. Also at one point the movie has a horrendously out-of-place musical number in it, like in some Disney flick. Yeah, this merman's design is suspiciously reminiscent of some sidekick of Hellboy in Del Toro's own movie.<br/><br/>So, best movie of the year? No way. I've recently also watched ""Three Billboards..."", and it's miles ahead than this trash."

Its a clichéd storyline, with clichéd characters and a route 1 ending.

"ameliacimpoesu","1","12","39","16 April 2018"," Under expectations
","Shape of water sounds like a fancy movie, the one that you necessarly need to see and you hear people all over talking about it...
But, then, you go to the cinema and watch it... I must say, I was extremely unpatient about watching this ,,Oscar'' movie and only hearing its name would make me giddy. However, the impression with which I left after the movie, was ridiculousness.
In the first place, you can fill the whole ocean with how many clichés there were included in this film... One girl that sees some shoes which she cannot afford in the showcase and a couple of tv's in its back. 
Then, the villain, Strickland, it's the most classy negative character that you can ever imagine. He is the bad guy, who doesn't really understand others, but does ,,the best"" for his job. He tortures the creature like he has a brain made out of cheese and when he open his mouths you hear a 2 year-old speaking. He also impersonated the though guy, who forces his fingers off his hand when he gets mad. 
 As well as the other characters, she (Eliza Esposito) is the hero of the action, the one who stands out of the crowd, and puts her job at risk for a monster, who, by the way, didn't even know. She falls in love with him after giving him an egg because ,,they understand each other''. Nonsense!
 Mr. Arzoumanian, Eliza's bestfriend is a sort of Geppeto, from Pinnochio. He likes lemon pie and, another common thing, is that he has a fridge full of those pies! He tries to be sympathetic but his jokes, from my opinion, are not that funny.
 Moreover, there were some scenes that were inappropriate and they weren't supposed to be there. For example, even if the writer or the director wanted to express something, I found the scene when Eliza and the monster lock in the bathroom without ANY sense. I mean, Eliza didn't even know him...
 In contrast with the points listed above, the movie also had nice images and music, which induced you somehow in a magicshly atmosphere and created a bit of a cliff-hanger. Anyway, the good parts don't compensate the negative ones..."

","As with Pan's Labyrinth, Del Toro's film just misses in key areas. He does what he wants, what looks good or causes a sudden shock to the viewer despite a lack of logic and against human nature. The production design is first rate, the sets are characters in their own right, nearly eclipsing the humans in some scenes. The musical score is delightful, but not quite as retiring into the background as the Making of... short suggested. <br/><br/>I gave this film 8 stars for gorgeous visuals with flawed writing. I wanted to go to 9, then read what I wrote and couldn't do it. <br/><br/>Examples of what made no sense:<br/><br/>Why didn't the artist mourn his just-devoured cat? He just shrugged it off moments later, maybe because there's plenty more cats to go around?? Weird. <br/><br/>How was the fish man not seen as he went into the theater, empty but running the film anyway. Who was in the projection booth? Very weird. <br/><br/>Why wasn't the building owner more upset about the huge, destructive flood? Super weird. <br/><br/>Yet, the film was engrossing because of Michael Shannon's single-minded yet self-destructive ambition, he really carried the film. Richard Jenkins's character was charming, but weak, Olivia Butler was excellent, and Doug Jones was fabulous. Sally Hawkins was brave and daring as an actress, and completely vulnerable yet determined as a character. We felt the pacing wasn't quite intense enough, but not enough to quibble about. <br/><br/>I wish I knew why Del Toro just misses each time. I suspect it's a European vs American sensibility situation. His visuals, though, are so wonderful I'll keep watching his films for that pleasure alone."

So, a movie which seemed to me like the same proposal, it would be worth my money. <br/><br/>I was wrong.<br/><br/>The film does have a great acting from the actress, Sally Hawkins, including others, such as Michael Shannon, who even made me think that he could be the new Joker for a new Batman movie, but that's all. Nothing more positive, the rest of it to me sounds like a disaster.<br/><br/>The plot is very weak, although we should see some good intention behind, the writing, the script, the conversations are weak, often without ""foot nor head"", an expression that I usually use to say something that is not fullbodied, complete or has sense of logic; the narrative is an attempt of a convincing story that failed miserably, photography is just another try to improve the movie, and the soundtrack is a mess.<br/><br/>I have no doubt if all this was intended to cause a plot twist in the head of the viewer, it would be great, but I dont think so, even more by the way how the film deals with a ""inter-species relationship.""<br/><br/>I particularly do not have many prejudices and Im always open-minded when it comes to the Art as is the cinema, but I still feel it fails miserably, because it presents prejudices and cliches that the own critics and the own (post-moderns) people would do bad-mouthing and wishing the worse if it were me to make a film like this, they would still call me of sick, for example. Outrageous<br/><br/>Anyway, each one with their problems and this film for me is very problematic, so I make this review.<br/><br/>Thank you."

"TxMike","Null","6","17","14 April 2018"," Modern fable, a different type of beauty and beast.
","My wife and I watched this movie at home on DVD from our public library. Much anticipated as it won a number of Oscars recently.<br/><br/>I was not particularly thrilled with the movie during most of its first half, I didn't really know where it was going and the military guys wanting to kill the creature from the Amazons in S. America seemed to brutal. But as the story developed and more appreciated the acting and cinematography I found it better and better.<br/><br/>Sally Hawkins is great as the mute cleaning lady, Elisa Esposito, working in a secret government lab. When they bring in the mysterious amphibious creature and store it in a water tank she is fascinated. Set in the early 1960s, in the Baltimore area, there is a competition with the Russians to see who could learn the secrets of this creature.<br/><br/>The villain is Michael Shannon as Richard Strickland, very gruff and chauvinistic, with a mission to accomplish. He is played partly as a mild caricature which works well and leads to some funny moments. Even though he didn't win any awards to me his performance was the best in this movie.<br/><br/>Richard Jenkins is always good and here he is Giles, a commercial artist, who shares living space with Elisa. And, although we never see his real self, Doug Jones Doug is really effective as the Amphibian Man.<br/><br/>The title of the movie derives partly from the idea that love is all around us and the theme is water here, it is all around us and takes the shape that it needs to take. I enjoyed the movie, it certainly isn't for all tastes but it is quite different from most modern movies. The DVD extras are also very interesting, explaining concepts and showing some of how the movie was made.<br/><br/>SPOILERS follow, do not read further if you haven't seen the movie. Elisa plans and executes a daring heist, sneaking the Amphibian out of the lab and into her apartment just before it was to be killed and vivisected. She has fallen in love with it, they actually have sex. In the end, needing to get him back into salty water Strickland finds them and shoots both of them. But the Amphibian has magical healing abilities, he gets up and dispatches Strickland with a great slash to the throat, then carries Elisa into the water, and facilitates her developing gills, she is alive, they live happily ever after."
"hessluana","5","9","29","12 April 2018"," Racist aspects ignored!
","This could have been a lovely,imagematic film, a poetic love story, an eerie Princess Bride, but Guillermo Del Toro once again offends the audience with contrivances just to shock and dismay with obvious racist tendencies everyone in Hollywood seemed to ignore. What did the Pie seller, a Blonde,buff, alpha male, have to do with the plot? Why did he cruelly refuse to serve his pie to the lovely African American couple, and ,again, what did this have to do with the plot? And why was he a homophobe? What did that have to do with the plot? And why was the most despicable,cruel character reading The Power of Positive Thinking? Del Toro is no Ang!!! Brokeback Mountain was a poignant, honest, brilliant film. You can promote an inclusive society with art, I agree, and show prejudice in our culture in art, also, but just tossing into the story bits and pieces of disgusting and contrived behavior is insulting. Shame on you, Guillermo."

"postsenthil","9","4","10","27 October 2019"," A MUST WATCH !!
","Director Guillermo Del Toro is a magical creator who is capable of conjuring up unique, mystical and quite magnificent settings for his narratives and has set this story in Baltimore of early 1960s.<br/><br/>It is a tender and captivating romance between a mute janitor Elisa (Sally Hawkins) working in a top secret research facility and a creature captured from Amazon which is part fish and part human and is believed to be a river god by local populace. The government seeks to experiment on this mysterious creature for space research and sees it merely as an asset which is dispensable. But, the mute janitor sees it as more of a fellow being - a companion who is capable of communication as well as feelings of compassion, empathy and love.<br/><br/>Del Toro weaves a fantastic tale around this romance in the cold war era which is largely made possible and believable by an Oscar worthy performance from an excellent Sally Hawkins who is ably supported by Octavia Spencer, Richard Jenkins, Michael Stuhlberg as well as Michael Shannon. Great music by Alexandre Desplat and vivid visuals from Dan Laustsen add further allure to this moving fable.<br/><br/>That a story could be so simple, surreal, yet layered in so many subtle shades and suffused with such a gentle and generous spirit all through is an extraordinary achievement of this ace auteur for, in less trained hands, it could have so easily become a caricature or worse."

","This movie is a mess. I have disagreed with the Academy's choice for best picture in the past because they did not select my favorite film in any particular year, but ultimately I could always recognize that the film that beat mine was certainly a film of great merit. The Shape of Water breaks that mold. Sure, the production design was spot on, the cinematography beautiful (most of the time), and the cast is stellar. But my goodness, what a horrible plot for an essentially boring story that centered around an oddball assortment of one-note characters. <br/><br/>This movie kinda feels like a kids movie, but made for adults with the obligatory sex, violence and politics. I watched the entirety of the 2 hour run time because I like to view every best picture nominee in order to properly judge which of the films was more deserving than the others.

I like del Toro movies, by enlarge they tend to be very engaging. Pans Labyrinth being one of my fav movies. However I couldn't connect with this one. Well acted for sure but nothing Ive not seen before, for example the mute character was just a rip off of AmÃ©lie and the rest was beauty and the beast. It was crude - daily masturbation is not something I want to see. I get it but you don't have to drill it home del Toro - its not clever mate and after a while I just found the main character annoying. Any way it gets worse and I draw the line at the love scene...really ...too much del Toro- please give it a rest. Not a great watch just plain weird and I left feeling ripped off and seriously underwhelmed. Watch it if you like and make up your own mind but I recommend you watch a proper film like Dunkirk and enjoy the scale of that movie. How does Dunkirk not win the best picture or best director? Oscar's winner really have been weird as of late. But who knows what happens behind the scenes?As we know from recent events anything goes in Hollywood so I do wonder what perks did the studio provide to the voters of this one.

"y_m-00834","1","8","26","16 February 2018"," What an ugly piece of crap!
","I cannot really embrace the fact that ""The shape of the water"" is nominated for 13 Oscars, since it's definitely not academy awards quality, either plot-wise or visually. One little heads up before you watch this movie: don't expect to see anything beautiful, for every thing tremendously lacks appeal in this film, whether the characters or their acting or the settings. I'm not sure if the morals of the film is about reconciling the human/nature dichotomy by showing a very queer scene of an inter-species intercourse, or it's trying to be very liberal by acknowledging the right of the minorities (blacks, homosexuals or even those interested in cross-species coupling); either way it fails to convey its message because the logic of the film is next to meaningless. 
An unappealing mute girl, seemingly alone and not very sociable ( since she regularly jerks off in her bathtub every morning), meets a beast which is one of the ugliest characters ever designed for a Sci-Fi movie. Some eggs 
are exchanged between the two that leads to a very strong romantic relationship. And they finally choose to stay together. This is only a fraction of the whole mess you're about to watch in this film which is enough to make a movie unbearable for me. The girl, by the way, lives in a cold war era, working in a very top secret facility involved in a very serious business (because we see some people speak Russian with each other) as a janitor, but wait, apparently janitors are given a significant importance in this system, for they're pretty much everywhere and talking to anyone including chiefs and presidents. One final critic, there are posters seen throughout the movie advising against ""wasting water"", but at the end of the film we see a girl (magically) fills up her bathroom with water through a running faucet, in order to make love with a fish/human hybrid. Isn't it a total waste?"

"lambchopnixon","1","10","35","16 March 2018"," Ridiculously fake and superficial: were you fooled by it?
","1. So, she's mute and we are being manipulated immediately by this fake plot construct: it's to get us interested in her because the director hasn't the skill to impart ""inner life"" to the character.
2. The skin-deep inner life that is displayed - her love for the evocative innocence in the movies is a lie. It's fake, just another manipulative plot construct as it's just to get us back to the 1950s where people so much more disliked people other than themselves that they could treat the creature this nasty way.
3. As if today, people don't hate ""the other"" where laws in states across the U.S. are being rolled back to allow prejudice, drone bombings have so much more recently killed indiscriminately anyone nearby. No, you don't have to hide in the 1950s to show intolerant people. (Or the long-gone Spanish Civil War.)
4. By being in the 1950s, the director can also hide his superficial, vacuous filmmaking behind a glossy veneer as if that's content.
5. The creature is a total non-entity - in more ways than one, surface only.
6. Woman doesn't only sympathise with its plight - no, way too boring, that won't bring the crowds in to see the movie. No, she's got to fall in love with it. Still not enough! Right, she's got to take it home!! How's that gonna work? Bathtub, she can keep it in the bathtub. How about some table salt to make its ""natural environment""? Ooo nice touch. Yeah, pour in all in. We gotta manipulate them all a bit more yet - creature stops breathing for a moment before the salt takes effect! Genius.
7. Not, not enough. Dream sequence. Yeah. In a ballroom - they are romantically attached and we as writer/director have no imagination of sensitivity to come up with anything - so, put them in a ballroom. The fish man and girl ballroom dancing in a dream sequence!!!! In An American in Paris, Top Hat, Singin' in the Rain The Red Shoes, dancing as part of the action works wonderfully. The difference here? Manipulative and shallow filmmaking leads to expose of just how much imagination the man really has."

","Del Toro's finest? Really? What I saw was Sally Hawkins having an affair with the creature from the black lagoon. I tried to imagine it was a veiled attack on racism, but it could just as easily be seen as pro-bestiality propaganda. I heard Del Toro refer to it as a fairy tale for our times, and I presumed he meant these times of revealed male sexual harassment in the movie industry. So Sally gets her kit off in the first five minutes and we get a gratuitous look at her from above in the bath. Beautiful, yes; necessary, no. No balancing male nudity because the creature from the black lagoon is already latex naked. And then they put towels long the edges of the bathroom door and fill the room up with water so they can have aqua sex, although of course Sally can't breathe under water, and of course, rooms in houses are not water tight. Sally got the idea from seeing Paddington do it back at her house a couple of years earlier, but that was a kids' movie. It's silly and funny in a kids' movie.

"WinterWoodwere1","6","3","7","22 November 2019"," Green, but not so good
","The Shape of Water is one of the greenest movies I have ever seen, and it is aware of this. The color choice is visually stimulating for a while, but quickly falls from stylistic to redundant.<br/><br/>The film, is overall quite good, well written, well shot, but it lacks a genuine feel of a singular vision, and instead feels like the best outcome of assembly line film making. Even though that is generally an insult, this is still the best example of that process. The shots are decently composed, the script is decent, and the set design is detailed but glaringly unbelievable.
In line with the stagnant color palette, most of the characters fail to develop beyond their initial portrayal, but at least they are maintain some believably. Minimal character development aside, the rest of the writing is fair. It regularly leaves logic behind in service of the plot, but never enters the realm of unbelievable. Most of the movie can be described as: ""not as bad as it could be, but still not great.""<br/><br/>The movie is easy to access for a more general audience, but does little to reward repeated viewings, or in depth analysis. Simple characters unfortunately rob this movie of much of its potential story value. As the best case scenario for assembly line film making, these underdeveloped characters are at least developed enough to not become completely boring: just don't expect something great."

","There are a ton of people trashing this film on here, and criticizing the story, when in all actuality, it doesn't seem like too many of you even understand what the story was trying to portray. Now, this film was far from perfect ..I'm not sure it deserved an Oscar...but it is a solid film, with a great message if you are able to understand what that message is.<br/><br/>This movie was not some weird science fiction ""love"" story... It is a solid attempt to portray how prejudiced some people are, and makes for a great example of why a book shouldn't be judged by it's cover. The female lead has her own fair share of issues, being that she is a mute, who had a pretty traumatic beginning to her life. Her closest allies are an African American woman who works as an interpreter for the muted woman who communicates through sign language..and her closeted gay neighbor who seems to have the same fears of any closeted homosexual...fear of being outcased and judged for being different. All three of these people can find common ground with the ""monster"" in this movie, because they too are well aware of what it is like to be mistreated and judged and wronged simply for being different than the ""norm"".<br/><br/>The hate, that is deeply rooted in fear, of the white male antagonist showed just how serious and dangerous that type of fear can be....every day in America, ""monsters"" are bullied and ridiculed and sadly even beat or murdered simply because they are different. The monster in this movie was a metaphor for the real life ""monsters"" here in real life today...the ""monsters"" are the minorities...African Americans, homsexuals, people with disabilities...anyone who is different than the typical white privileged man...these groups of minorities are the undeserved recipients of some of the most inhumane treatment imaginable similar to how the majority would treat or view or judge a real life monster.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Solid flick with a message that is needed in today's day and age.

"Camelot_2000","10","3","7","7 February 2019"," I thought It Was An Updated Version Of ""Creature From The Black Lagoon"".
","Boy, was I wrong! When I first heard of this film, I immediately judged it to be just another ""fish out of water"" story, but there was more here than meets the eye. After hearing of the rave reviews and seeing it win the Oscar for 'Best Picture', I knew I had to check it out. Regardless to say, I wasn't disappointed. The whole picture is visually stunning and grips you right until the end. This so-called Fish-Out-Of-Water story had reached a whole new level of what superb movie-making is all about.<br/><br/>Ever since Pan's Labyrinth, I've always been a fan of the director, Guillermo del Toro. He has a mystical and highly sentimental way of telling a story and cleverly intertwines fantasy creatures into that as well. He somehow manages to make it work without the audience quickly ridiculing and scoffing at the unbelievable fantasy angle of it.<br/><br/>In Pan's Labyrinth, the focus is on a girl who seems pretty much alienated from her Fascist and violent surroundings in World War II Spain and is drawn into a magical world of her own. The same type of theme is addressed here, with a mute cleaner at a top secret government base discovering and later falling in love with an ocean humanoid.<br/><br/>There's a connection between the two right from the beginning and it seems ""bizarre"" at first, but the more the movie moves along, the more acceptable the situation becomes. We gradually get to see that the connection between these two different types of species is more linked than we first realized.<br/><br/>Giles, as an extremely close friend and devoted next door neighbor to the mute cleaning lady, is a major highlight. The most unforgettable moment is when he develops a crush on a sexy, good looking guy working at a diner and tries to ignite a passion between them. When he later finds out the guy is homophobic and racist to boot, he grows to realize that he's truly ""alone"" and didn't want his mute friend to be in the same lovelorn state he was in. He wanted to help her gain her true love - the ocean humanoid.<br/><br/>There's plenty of suspense and at first it all looks bleak, but then, of course, in true del Toro fashion, there are miracles that lay ahead. This is an excellent movie with an equally excellent cast and it all manages to work superbly despite the story's unbelievable premise. I highly recommend it. One of the best films I ever saw."
"MendicuttiD","8","3","7","7 January 2019"," Guillermo's Greatness.
","I think it's wonderful and quite beneficial for the world of cinematography that there are still those who dare to challenge the imagination of the viewer with a fantasy film. This is how great stories are born, and that is why cinema has become a great fuel of dreams. However, this genre tends sometimes to be ridiculed by bad projects that sell only visual effects that captivate the eye, but not the mind. That's why Guillermo del Toro's work and career are so successful, who impressed us again with an excellent film project and, in the eyes of the academy, just because of the nominations his latest project received, this year he has premiered his Ninth Symphony.<br/><br/>The Shape of Water is an inspiring and captivating movie. As expected in the case of a project by this Mexican director, the film does not disappoint as far as aesthetics and visual wonders are concerned. In this section is a real jewel, a true cinematographic triumph, a work of art. The sequences are amazing, the cinematography is fabulous (even if Blade Runner 2049 took the prize) and the visual effects excellent. And, even with all the effort invested in this film had the above characteristics, it manages to tell a story that is worthy of seeing at least, with good performances and well-developed characters.<br/><br/>However, it is necessary for this, my work, to also raise the rock to search for little sins. While the script was shown as a solid competitor to take the Oscar at the 90th ceremony, finally beaten by Get Out, I wasn't amazed by it, nor with the plot. Even if it is an inspiring story, it's predictable and made me leave the movie theater with the feeling that ""I've seen this before"". It is the typical drama of fantastic otherness, in which the government and the military marginalize or imprison something they do not know or understand. Amid the confusion, a hero or heroine emerges and begins to become intimate with the creature in question. Having developed a considerable level of affection for the creature or creatures, it seeks to free them from the clutches of a governmental agent or several, whose only interest is to benefit from what they keep in captivity.<br/><br/>Even with this characteristic, The Shape of Water is a project that, in a matter of direction, deserved every part of that well-earned Best Director Oscar. All of this thanks to the visual effects, cinematography, and characters that turn out to be endearing. And in that field, if I had to choose one that really exceeded my expectations, it was the character played by Michael Shannon. Once again, Guillermo Del Toro proposes an excellent villain, full of frustrations, psychopathy, inferiority / superiority complex combined, among other things that make his presence in the film remarkable. Great merit without a doubt for the actor who seems to gain more and more momentum in each project in which he participates. In general, all the characters have their own brightness and depth worthy of being taken into account. The protagonist played by Sally Hawkins, the amphibious man who is dedicated to surprise the viewer throughout the film, the performance of Octavia Spencer (Which in my opinion didn't had enough to be nominated for an Oscar but is wasn't bad either). Good characters, good messages.<br/><br/>This is a very good movie, worthy of being remembered. And it has to, being named Best Picture of 2017. But, in my opinion, it was a good contender for that award season, without being the greatest of all. However, it is a great incentive for young filmmakers in Mexico as well as to shut the mouth of those who say that no film talent comes from Mexico. I hoped that Guillermo Del Toro can hold the statuette for directing at the end of the night, and I saw him hold many more. And no, I didn't went out to the streets to celebrate with the Mexican flag when Del Toro won, because it is not a project of Mexico but of him.

","While the movie starts off really nicely, and I enjoyed watching it throughout, I knew immediately when I'd watched it, that this isn't a movie I'm going to remember, or, for that matter, watch again.<br/><br/>It contains several beautiful scenes with good visuals and camera/lighting work. Also, it mimics some of that 1960s feel, coupled with the bizarre, futuristic science-fiction elements. This is the central element of what should make this movie memorable. And it does it well in setting it up. <br/><br/>However, when the plot gets going, it turns out to be all too familiar. The naive, goodhearted protagonist, decides to step up and help a poor creature, which has been captured by the evil antagonist.<br/><br/>The movie suffers from painting such a simplistic picture of the characters. As the plot is so basic, the movie needs to be carried by its characters. And where the protagonist is a goodhearted, socially isolated and awkward woman, the antagonist is a brutal, sadistic, sexistic, and patriotic american male, who despises the Russians. <br/><br/>There is a certain feeling of forced 'social justice' in the plot. The evil, white man is up against a group of kind-hearted minorities: two women -- one deaf and one black -- together with two men -- one gay and one Russian -- set out to save a strange, but good, amphibian creature. But this generic caricature isn't really interesting, challenging, or original. <br/><br/>And this makes the movie as such neither interesting, challenging, nor original."
"michaelRokeefe","7","3","7","27 June 2018"," Love is strange
","From the mind of director/writer Guillermo del Toro, a weird love story to say the least. A lonely, mute Eliza Espisito (Sally Hawkins) works as a cleaner at a secretive, high-security government labratory with her best friend, Zelda (Octavie Spencer). Her life will change forever after she stumbles upon an unbelievable experiment; the government is doing studies on an amphibious creature that is being held in captivity in a small tank of water. It becomes obvious that the creature can crudely communicate and seems to be intelligent enough to reason and have emotions. Strange, but true, Eliza develops a relationship with the creature and must summon help to release the amphibian before he is killed for further study. Awkward, clumsy, ugly and more than a bit far-fetched. Many critics have been outspokenly disappointed. For some I shame for not giving this film a chance.<br/><br/>Also in the cast: Michael Shannon, Richard Jenkins, Nick Searcy, Nigel Bennett, Allegra Fulton, Michael Stuhlbarg and Doug Jones, as the Amphibian Man."

","Beautiful to look at and constructed with an old school filmmaking sensibility that moulds together well with Guillermo Del Toro's particular directional style and off-beat dark humour, the much acclaimed The Shape of Water is a good film but it's also not the so-called great film that's been lavished with an equal record 13 Academy Award nominations.<br/><br/>It's not hard to pinpoint where Water excels and where its caught a little short, as surprisingly what lets Del Toro's visually captivating and sometimes fantastical treat down, is the very romance and relationship at the heart of this somewhat stereotypical monster infused romance.<br/><br/>Built around Sally Hawkins mute, lonely and bathtime loving cleaning lady Elisa Esposito, who spends her night's listening to Octavia Spencer's The Help co-worker Zelda, only to find herself inraptured with a new fishy specimen at her work, Water neither spends enough time building the star crossed friendship/romance that builds between Elisa and Doug Jone's fishman or spends enough time with the two central figures as a whole as Del Toro instead focuses a lot of his attention's on side plots and distractions that work sometimes and plod at other times.<br/><br/>With Del Toro choosing to fill his pre-Cold War set tale with nasty government baddies in the lead form of the hamming it up evil Michael Shannon, Richard Jenkins repressed artist/pie lover and kindly neighbour Giles and Michael Stuhlbarg's Russian spy with a conscience Dr. Robert Hoffstetler, the heart of Water gets muddled at times and while clearly an elergy for race, the minorities and acceptance, this Beauty and the Beast with added H20 could've benefited from a greater focus and a more prominent beating heart.<br/><br/>Disappointments aside, the craft of Del Toro's best project in year's is top notch.<br/><br/>Following on from the gothically handsome yet genuinely bad Crimson Peak, Water is a return to form for the Mexian auteur in a production and construction sense with Dan Laustsen's cinematography capturing the film brilliantly, Paul D. Austerberry production design encapsulating the period with only a handful of sets, while Alexandre Desplat's award winning score is another fine piece of work for the composser.<br/><br/>The film also features some committed and noteworthy turns with Hawkins in particular leading from the front and the always solid Stuhlbarg, who has had a great few years in front of the camera.<br/><br/>Other Oscar nominated turns from Jenkins and Spencer seem more like the Academy getting a little carried away, with both performers delivering autopilot like turns, while Shannon needs to move very carefully in the coming months to make sure these off-kilter wide-eyed maniac's his made his built his career on don't completely pigeonhole him into a one dimensional character actor for hire.<br/><br/>Final Say -<br/><br/>There have been many that have and will continue to fall under The Shape of Water's spell but this Oscar frontrunner leaves a lot to be desired emotionally from it's romantic core, even if craft wise, this is Del Toro at the peak of his filmmaking powers.<br/><br/>3 1/2 house cat's out of 5"

However, being a giant fan of horror/fantasy movies (and cinematic monsters in particular) as well as an avid admirer of Guillermo Del Toro, I suppose I should be very happy ""The Shape of Water"" won the Oscar for best film. Well, I'm not. In the 2018-edition, the one and only film that truly deserved to win was ""Three Billboards outside of Ebbing, Missouri"".<br/><br/>""The Shape of Water"" is, occasionally, a truly beautiful and emotionally confronting requiem. Presented as a homage (or maybe even a belated sequel?) to the magnificent ""Creature from the Black Lagoon"", the story takes place during the gritty Cold War era and revolves around a timid and mute cleaning lady at a research laboratory who romantically bonds with a fish man-creature in captivity. Del Toro demonstrates his excellent craftsmanship via the stunning decors, the uncanny atmosphere, the dazzling use of colors and a handful of imaginatively poetic moments. And yet, there were far too many sequences that were too childish, far-fetched and preachy. Michael Shannon is a terrific actor, but his umpteenth role as an evil government agent is too much of a caricature, and so are the depictions of Octavia Spencer (as the good-hearted black woman) and Richard Jenkins (as the homosexual neighbor). If Del Toro ever deserved to win an Oscar for his fantasy oeuvre, it should have been for ""Pan's Labyrinth""."

","An unusual fairy tale by visual master Guillermo Del Toro, ""The Shape of Water"" is surprisingly simplistic despite its unusual central love story between a mute janitor and a displaced man-fish creature. As with most Del Toro movies, the sets, production design and creature effects are painstakingly designed and visually arresting, not to mention his effective, evocative use of music. Nevertheless, despite a series of escalating conflicts there seems to be a sense of urgency missing from the narrative, but luckily the strong acting provides the gravitas and makes up for some of its shortcomings. In particular, Sally Hawkins and Richard Jenkins are well-matched and make a sweet, likable pair of underdogs together."

Elisa's existence consists of the same routine ritual everyday.
Get up, take a bath, cook breakfast, go to work and then repeat.
Her only solice is that of her neighbour Giles played by Richard Jenkins. He too struggles through life as a down on his luck artist.
It is when at the facility Elisa discovers a mesmerising amphibious humanoid played by Doug Jones that she forms a bond with the tortured creature. From then on the strangest and most unique romance story unfolds.
I will admit that certain scenes of the movie had me a little at unease.
The thought of a shy retiring girl getting her freak on with a Merman is at first a little off putting but it's the way everyone involved in this film sells the story that kept me intrigued.
Sally Hawkins in particular is wonderful. Never a word spoken through out the movie, her performance was still alluring.
Michael Shannon was as usual brilliant in his role as the evil Colonel Richard Strickland.
There's something about Shannon's performances in all his movies. The actor demands and then captures your attention.
Doug Jones is always the go to man when you need an actor to convey a convincing performance through prosthetics.
His turn here as the amphibious creature is very good.
Everyone involved in this production, in front or behind the camera have done a terrific job in bringing such an unlikely story to life.
The Shape Of Water is a gorgeously made movie."
"leonblackwood","7","2","4","19 August 2018"," A unique movie but the concept is a bit warped! 7/10
","Review:
A lot of people have compared this movie to Amelie, which I haven't seen, so I was going into the film with an open mind. In the beginning, I couldn't see how this film was going to become interesting but once the mysterious creature, and Michael Shannon (Richard Strickland), came into play, I quite enjoyed it. You can't fault the movie for its originality, and brilliant performances from the whole cast but you do have to be in the right frame of mind to watch it. As usual, Guillermo del Toro pushes the visionary experience to the max, and his attention to detail is second to none but I found the whole ""Beauty & The Beast"" concept a bit weird, especially when they started to get a bit fruity with each other. Anyway, Sally Hawkins plays a mute called Elisa Esposito, who communicates with sign language and works as a cleaner at a secret government laboratory in Baltimore, during the Cold War. Her only friends are her workmate, Zelda (Octavia Spencer), and her gay next-door neighbour Giles (Richard Jenkins), who is a struggling advertising illustrator. When the laboratory receives a mysterious creature, which was captured in the Amazon River by Richard Strickland, who treats it brutally by repeatedly shocking it with an electric cattle prod, Elisa shows sympathy towards the creature by giving him eggs, whilst playing music. She soon realises that it's a male humanoid amphibian, and she regularly visits him in secret, teaching him sign language. Strickland convinces his superiors that they should kill the creature, to investigate his body for Americans gain but one of the scientist, Robert Hoffstetler (Michael Stuhlberg), who is really a Soviet spy called Dimitri Mosenkov, wants to keep it alive for further study. Robert is also ordered by his Soviet superiors to kill the creature, so the Russians can experiment on him but he has grown to sympathise with him because of the way that the creature has been treated whilst in captivity. Elisa hears the Americans talking about killing the creature, so she plots with Giles to release the creature into a nearby canal when it rains to give access to the ocean in several days time. During the escapade, Robert decides to help Elisa, along with Zelda who was initially against the plan. Once they get the creature back to Elisa's apartment, she keeps it alive in her bathtub, by using salt and a special substance that Robert gives her. To not look suspicious, Elisa and Zelda still go to work, even though Strickland is interrogating all of there employees but he's unable to gain any information. Elisa then becomes close with the creature and she initiates sex in her bathroom, which she fills completely up with water. Meanwhile, Strickland's superiors give him 36 hours to find the creature, and Robert is told that he will be extracted in two days time. Robert then goes to meet his handlers, with Strickland tailing him, and when Robert is surprisingly shot by his so-called comrades Strickland decides to save him, by killing the handlers. After interrogating Robert about the creature's whereabouts, Strickland kills Robert, and then he heads to Zelda's house to find out where the creature is. Her husband tells Strickland that Elisa has the creature, so he spares there life, and he goes straight to Elisa's, who has been tipped of by Zelda. Strickland finds a note which reveals the plan about escaping in the canal, so he makes his way there, and he shoots the creature and Elisa just before they are about to jump into the water. The creature manages to self-heal himself, so he kills Strickland and he jumps into the canal with Elisa, to try and save her life. Quite a touching story! The love story is strange but sweet at the same time but it's really the performances that made the movie for me. Shannon is brilliant as the villain, and Jenkins made me laugh as the innocent, gay best friend. Spencer was also top class as Elisa's close friend, along with Stuhlberg, who didn't know if he was coming or going through the whole movie. On the downside, no one seemed that shocked when they saw the mysterious creature, and you must be completely out of your mind to have sexual contact with it. I also thought that the whole finger thing with Shannon, was going to lead somewhere, and that whole ""fill up the bathroom with water"" thing was completely unrealistic. Anyway, I personally enjoyed the film but I don't know if I would go as far to say that it deserved the best picture Oscar this year. I did think that Three Billboards was a better film but Guillermo del Toro deserved the Best Director Oscar, mainly because of his contribution to cinema. Enjoyable!<br/><br/>Round-Up:
This movie was directed by Guillermo del Toro, who also brought you Cronos in 1993, Mimic, The Devil's Backbone, Blade II, Pan's Labyrinth, Hellboy II: The Golden Army, Pacific Rim and Crimson Peak in 2015. Coming from an artistry's background, he draws all of his movies in storyboard form before production, and I must admit, he is an amazing artist. He's also an extremely detailed director, whose work can't be fully appreciated unless you watch films a few times. I personally think that he concentrates on the look more than the storyline, especially in films like Crimson Peak and Hellboy II but I'm sure that there are people out there that will disagree with me. With movies like Dr. Jekyll & Mr. Hyde, Pinocchio, Drood and Fantastic Voyage in development, he certainly has a full diary, especially after earning the Best Director Oscar this year. I can't really see a sequel to this movie, judging by the ending but anything is possible in Hollywood.<br/><br/>Budget: $19.5millions
Worldwide Gross: $195millions<br/><br/>Genre: Adventure, Drama, Fantasy
Cast: Sally Hawkins, Michael Shannon, Richard Jenkins, Octavia Spencer, Michael Stuhlbarg, Doug Jones, Nigel Bennett, Lauren Lee Smith and David Hewlett. 7/10"
"rachaelblakeegypt","7","2","4","18 August 2018"," Combination of classic and modern cultures
","The Shape of Water is one of the cult-classic which combines a blend of classic and modern cultures. This is why Oscar love the movie apart from the premise which I guess seems simple, predictable, and ridiculous as I always see on the local television as romance crappy story. Guillermo Del Toro shows a simple blend of it with the fantasy technique that he always used in all his movies. The visual is one of the gorgeous pieces that ever existed, Sally Hawkins is incredible while doing a sign language, a mute princess. The set-up and production design are flawlessly underwhelmed when the film gets a lot of reputation at Oscar and the world. Some social issues may be fairly simple in this film but it can be used as a reference. But, this is a fairy tale that mixes adult components. In a nutshell, it's just a human being had sex with fish."
"NikkoFranco","8","2","4","15 August 2018"," Somehow flawed, somehow touching
","Guillermo del Toro has built a formidable reputation as a director over the years, however I have some reservations about this film; First- When I saw the trailer for this film, I was reminded of the childhood classic "" The Creature from the Black Lagoon "" and "" Children of a Lesser God "" meets a gloomy little mermaid kind of familiarity sort of impression. Second- some of the actors have no character development so the viewer is left with the predictable protagonists outsmart the antagonists kind of pace. Of Olivia Spencer and Richard Jenkins , I can only say that these two are engaging actors albeit underrated most of the times. They are the most relatable actors in this film entirety as well. For some reason Sally Hawkins as the deaf mute can not elicit empathy from my general viewer's senses. This is because she lacks in her performance here the raw expressiveness that goes through an actor's eyes in a role like hers so that the lack of dialogue is not translated into intangible chemistry with the creature as was intended to be.
It's either you kinda hate this film or you kinda like it. But it's not the unforgettable type and will not make one stop eating fish immediately."

","I think it's a super movie as I said in the title. It's got a great story. The acting is even great, but I do not think it's the shape of water among the nine movies that are nominated for the best film this year.<br/><br/>
Guillermo del Toro has officially created a new world, which again has beautiful backgrounds as in every movie.
I liked the Crimson Peak movie before that but I could not show success in the same way.I am very pleased that Guillermo del Toro has succeeded in this film, which is a favorite of almost every film.<br/><br/>Now let's just say that I'm not really a super movie but I did not give a lot of information about the creature and I could not understand some places for example, what is this creature, what is the place, how it got in and how it got caught. 
Why all the people behaved close to the elisa while torturing him and he did not see him as a monster<br/><br/>
the super powers of creation could do a lot of things, but I could not understand some of the details about it, so I finally remember how Elisa eventually turned into something like that and the scar was on the other side.<br/><br/>but the movie really took me to a whole new world. It was so beautiful that it was like I was really living if I was not in a movie. Finally I like the movie very much but I do not think it is good enough to win the best movie award."

"architeer","7","2","4","1 July 2018"," A ""What if?"" Romance worth exploring.
","Watched ""The Shape of Water"". It's an outstanding movie. It's about sad and lonely people, drifting through their daily routines, which ends up becoming a sci-fI/ B-movie horror romance about overcoming fears and risking it all in the name of your friends and those that you love. I really wanted to see this in the theater, especially since I knew it would be a great movie once I saw the trailer. I actually listened to the soundtrack a month ago before seeing the film. The songs are like that heard from a carnival merry-go-round, with a hint of tango. I'm glad it won best picture. The muted greens and blacks and wets, the boiling water, the tub. Reflections of illuminated water, the sound of silence from sign language. Even the camera lights, and even the jello. All together, feeling like a swim in the deepest murkiest waters lit only by the moonlight from above.
I don't want to remember the historic portrayal of the movie, the attention to detail, or the cold war, blue collar vs. white collar, segregation, racism, homophobia. These elements are intricately layered into the story line, in all good ways. Instead, I want to remember Elisa and the amphibian man, alone, with no one else.
If you ever saw Hellboy II, there's a character named Abe that's so similar to this film's amphibian man. The feelings that Abe has for the elf princess Nuala are similarly captured in the same murkiness, but the only gesture of expression between the two is a track from Barry Manilow entitled ""I Can't Smile Without You"". If you ever felt like Abe and Nuala's story needed to end differently, then ""The Shape of Water"" at least gives you what you yearned for. ;)"

"Semisonic","7","2","4","1 March 2018"," Of monsters and men
","It's the space race and Cold War crazed 60's again, with America being at its finest: gloomy underground facilities, ""mission above humanity"" ethics and slightly covered racist undertones. And huge glorious metal beasts on four wheels of course.<br/><br/>And among those cold monstrosities live regular people, some big and self-important, some little, alone and confused. Elisa Esposito is a shy mute janitor girl working in some secret lab, whose life is a repetitive chore with the only refreshment being her dreams of something bigger and brighter, something we can only guess about from her gestures and the words of two people who understand her - a black co-worker and a older sexually confused painter with whom she shares a shabby but stylish apartment above a cinema.<br/><br/>What comes next may be viewed as yet another take on the ""beauty and the beast"" story, this time told mostly without words and taking place inside a dark rusty bunker instead of a palace. But it's more than just love between a woman who feels out of place around her own kind and a creature taken from its natural habitat. It's a story about all the rejects of this world who don't know where they belong or, even if they do, hardly receive any acceptance in return. About those who dare to dream, to stay true to themselves and to do what they believe in, even if the risk is high and the consequences may be severe.<br/><br/>In fact, this whole film feels like Guillermo del Toro's profession of love towards all those bizarre worlds filled with bizarre creatures that he's been creating for as long as we know him. The amphibian creature from The Shape of Water may not be directly connected to Abe Sapien from Hellboy, but it does feel like a homage to del Toro's roots, and to the gentle and sensitive side we rarely get to see in the monstrously looking things.<br/><br/>This film is much more sentimental than you could expect from a movie with Michael Shannon playing a violent creep with two zombie fingers sewn to his hand. So sentimental that one could suspect del Toro was putting some personal reflections on his life into it. Yet, just like the creatures his imagination brought to life aren't a pleasant view for some, so is the subtle mix of erotic fantasies and yearning for a kind touch displayed through bodily movements and pantomime not a fail-proof key to everyone's hearts. I, for one, can easily admire the creative brilliance of the entourage and its aesthetics, but when it comes to letting the main characters inside your own head and seeing the world through their eyes, The Shape of Water is as effective and eloquent as talking to a fish. I guess the 60% of my body that is water is not in shape enough for this trick to fully work."
"CineMuseFilms","7","2","4","21 January 2018"," a luscious production of an unoriginal fairy tale
","Auteurism is a key part of filmmaking mythology that leads us to view a film more favourably because of its director, actors, or cinematographer. Sight unseen, any film directed by Guillermo del Toro will attract superlatives like 'masterpiece', and such labels are now all over the sci-fi fantasy The Shape of Water (2017). It can be lonely for anyone to write against this tide.<br/><br/>Also described as an adult fairy tale, the story is set in a top-secret research facility during the 1960s Cold War. Mute cleaner Elisa (Sally Hawkins) lives alone in a small apartment above a movie theatre and lives a life of dreams and fantasy. As an introverted fringe-dweller she gravitates to other outliers, like her closeted gay neighbour Giles (Richard Jenkins) and her best friend and workmate Zelda (Octavia Spencer), an African-American who is also Elisa's sign language translator. Elisa's yearning for romance is answered when an amphibian monster is wheeled into the facility inside a water tank. The monster and Elisa form an immediate emotional bond and Elisa is determined to save him from the sadistic director Colonel Strickland (Michael Shannon). When the monster is scheduled for dissection Elisa and friends hatch a high-risk escape plan, with the increasingly deranged Colonel in hot pursuit.<br/><br/>This is a luscious production full of Gothic foreboding, dreamy underwater atmospherics, and repressed sexual desire. The kitsch retro laboratory evokes 60s sci-fi spoofs with a heavily saturated other-worldly colour palette. It is not a spectacular or even original set design nor is the monster convincing or scary. Like Elisa, he is mute and his aquatic outfit is little more elaborate than a party costume with big holes to let his lovable eyes shine through. In case we doubt who is the bad guy, the Colonel is the only one with a disintegrating gangrenous limb to signify the moral decay of male authority. Whatever narrative nuance exists is found in novel twists on the Beauty and the Beast fairy tale template where our heroine finds eternal love in a most unusual way. With neither the monster nor the narrative especially original, it is Sally Hawkins alone who holds our attention all the way to the story's implausible ending. As she did so beautifully in Maudie (2017), Hawkins has a unique expressive talent for portraying firm resolve with fragile vulnerability.<br/><br/>All fairy tales have a message, although some are more obscure than others. Unlike the thematic cohesiveness of the brilliant Pans Labyrinth (2006), del Toro has left The Shape of Water wide open for interpretation and many are applauding its ambiguity. However, like a Rorschach test, what you see depends on what is going on inside your head, whether it's the pain of 'otherness' or the yearning for love, mystery, excitement, or escape. Which returns us to the label 'masterpiece': if you are looking for one, you will find it. Others will be more moderately entertained with an engaging adult fairy tale that has more than enough charm for a full film of enjoyment."
"lopsilceci","7","2","4","18 January 2018"," Technically perfect; Weak script
","I'm not really a fan of Del Toro's style and movies but I decided to see this anyway because of all the awards buzz and because the trailer was very effective.<br/><br/>The first half of the movie does a very good job at introducing the characters and their world. The camera flows so beautifully from one action and place to the other that we get the sense of a world that is filled with life. 
We're also introduced to the villain, whom we know is obviously the villain the moment he appears on-screen. We even get a scene of him at his house with his family, which I initially assumed was to make him seem more human and rounded character. So far so good.<br/><br/>The second half of the movie, after they get the fish man out of the lab and to Elisa's house, was where the movie went downhill for me. The dialogue from the bad guys starts making no sense and sounding awkward (no one says things like that in the real world!), some scenes seem to be establishing subplots that go nowhere or add nothing to the plot, like when the villain buys a new car or when Elisa is creepily harrassed by the villain, implying that he's sexually attracted to her ( this is especially significant after the gratuitous scene of him having sex with his wife and telling her to be quiet). <br/><br/>My main problem with this film, was the villain. He was such a mean and disgusting character to everyone else and during the last few minutes, he became so cartoonishly evil that it was hard to take him seriously. 
How the hell did he know exactly where Elisa lived? How come no one even dared question him, stand up to him or not give him what he wanted? (Zelda's husband for example). The whole scene of him breaking into Zelda's home and threatening her was ridiculous, with his stupid dialogues and how he broke his fingers and threw them on the floor.<br/><br/>The random musical number was so silly and awkward, I wasn't sure if to take it seriously or as a parody. It reminded me of the scene in ""Young Frankenstein"" when the doctor tap dances with the monster. <br/><br/>I give it a 7 for it's technical achievements, as Direction, Cinematography, Production Design, Music and Acting were all excellent. Unfortunately, the script was the weakest part of this movie."
"CinematicInceptions","7","2","4","9 January 2018"," Weird but not altogether bad.
","This movie features the weirdest love story this side of Wes Anderson's Moonrise Kingdom, but oddly enough I rather enjoyed it. It was very similar in structure to director Guillermo del Toro's most acclaimed movie, Pan's Labyrinth, to the point that a few of the minor characters and moments seemed like carbon copies. In this case, I thought Toro did a better job using the setting of the 1950's to inform the world of the movie and introduce more plot complications. However, I thought it did a pretty good job with setting up and paying off several elements throughout. The payoffs weren't the most satisfying, but they succeeded in keeping my attention.
The relationship between Elisa and the amphibious monster that she falls in love with is definitely uncomfortable and unsettling at some points, but I bought it. Their relationship reminded me of Her in that the two parties have a deep emotional connection and don't mind the fact that they are completely different things despite some of the complications that arise from it. 
Tied in closely with their relationship is the fact that Elisa is mute. The movie puts her disability at the forefront in a plot sense, and it makes up a major part of Elisa's character but not all of it. Her relatively loneliness is no doubt caused by how few people are willing to take the time to interact with and get to know her. I liked seeing a mute character be the protagonist because I'd never seen that before, except with a minor character in Alejandro Inarritu's Babel. Plus, sign language and muteness are both things that can be incorporated into movies in really cool ways, and that is definitely true here.
The villain of the movie, Strickland, is ultra-masculine and validates himself by feeling powerful at every moment. The audience spends a lot more time alone with the villain than in most movies, which I thought made Strickland a better character. However, he falls off a bit in the third act of the movie where he started getting too over-the-top and spouting monologues. 
Although I was somewhat entertained, interested, and impressed by the movie, I do not agree with its two Golden Globe wins. Guillermo del Toro did a fine job directing, but I didn't think it was anything that deserved such recognition. I don't remember Alexander Desplat's score, but that in itself makes me disagree somewhat with the fact that he won the Globe for best score. This will probably get a few Oscar nominations once they come out, maybe even a win or two, but I don't consider it ""best of the year"" in any regard.
There is also a fairly talented cast featured here. I've seen Michael Shannon's name come up in a positive context several times in the past year, and while I wasn't amazed by his performance here, I thought he was well cast and would like to see him in other things. Octavia Spencer is a welcome and entertaining presence, as always, but this wasn't one of her better performances. Sally Hawkins doesn't have a ton of opportunity to showcase talent here, but I did think she made for a good emotional protagonist.
By now, it may be difficult to see this in theaters. If you are planning on seeing it, be warned that the subject matter is more than a little creepy and unsettling. It's not a jump-scare movie, though it was advertised that way a little, nor is it visually gross, but it will throw most audience members for a bit of a loop. Overall Rating: 7.3/10."

Apart from a few and very predictable twists and turns, the story is like a water in a pipe, flowing into the gutter. Absolutely un-Guillermo. Sad. The ending was downright awful. That's all they could do? make the gashes on her neck turn into gills. Ugh. The only thing lovely was that the actors played their characters well - although there too, the characters themselves were very shallow.

","I didn't have my hope that high because it says drama on genre, but I must admit that this film turned out good.

But it wasn't as boring as Blade Runner 2049. At least I could finish it in a day. <br/><br/>I only watched this film because it was Oscar's best film and it got three more Oscars. So, I wanted to find out how it was the best. But after I watched it, I had a little bit of disappointment. To be honest, it wasn't the best. Maybe it's because I'm not that much into love stories and dramas. If I was, I might say this film is one of the best just like some people said.<br/><br/>This film showed the love could occur in different situations and even between different species. There's nothing to consider when it comes to true love. I might think like that if I'm into love stories and such those things.<br/><br/>There were basically two main things I don't like. One was the completely naked scene and the other was sex scenes. As for me, my aunt is kind of conservative, so, I was lucky that I didn't watch this film with her. I watched alone. Thus, no one could scold me about I'm watching films with adult contents. I prefer if there were no such scenes.<br/><br/>All in all, this film is on average. If you are kind of into love stories and true love those kind of stuffs, this film could be a good one for you. But as for me, it was just a normal film. So, 6 stars only."
"dreamsrepository","4","7","26","6 April 2018"," Cold and alien in a bad way
","This movie was definitely not for me. In tone it's quite similar to ""Pushing Daisies"" or ""A Series of Unfortunate Events"", meaning it asks the viewer to actively suspend their disbelief.
But even when done so, it delivers a cold, alien romance that fails to move my heart (which is usually easily moved). It's hard to connect with any of the characters, except for Zelda. But she's just a sidekick that's never really developed fully.<br/><br/>Visually the movie is stunning. And perhaps my expectations of it being a thought provoking sci-fi ruined it for me. Instead I got of a fantasy fairy-tale for adults.

I only wish we saw more growth of said relationship leading up to the third act.<br/><br/>Despite playing a mute character, sally Hawkins is able to convey convincing emotion physically and she does it so very well. Standout supporting characters for me are Richard Jenkins and Michael Shannon.<br/><br/>The cinematography from del toro is at an all time high here, with colourful shots that pop off the screen and mesmerising transitions. Everything just looks great, though it doesn't compensate for the lacklustre subplot that doesn't quite live up to the main story and themes the film follows.<br/><br/>The Shape of Water is a great time, which explores two characters finding love through their disconnect from the world, and society.

Visually this was very interesting, I liked the style of the visuals, the greenness was apt and the injection of red into Elisas life was a clever visual clue to the change in her outlook.
The portrayal of the waterman was beautifully done, he looked real, regal and worthy of being worshipped as a special entity.The rest of the casting was good, particulary the two female leads, but I have yet to see anything with Michael Shannon in which he doesn't portray a sadistic, cruel and misogynistic evangelical nutjob! He does it very well, and came across as a vile human being, but as far as my limited knowledge goes, it seems he is in great danger of becoming typecast.<br/><br/>Now some of the dislikes-
The story could have been told in 20 minutes, I'm not great with metaphors but I assume it was intended as a comment on how society is so judgemental about anything that might be percieved as 'different'. I have no problem with sex scenes on screen as long as there is some context to the overall story, I feel that the scene with Strickland and his wife was utterly superfluous and uneccesary, as were there straight in there masturbation scenes!!, none of which added anything to the narrative. Then, the addition of the 'Fred and Ginger' scene nearly knocked me off my sofa, and NOT in a good way, where the hell did THAT come from? Then there is the bit where the waterman runs away and just stands there watching a film in a cinema without any one seeing him go in?? Why, oh why, couldn't they just get him in the van and take him directly to the canal, why wait on the rains, the water was there the whole time? or take him a few yards further to the sea, which was obviously a stones throw from his intended entry into the canal.
I could go on but sadly it's not really worth the effort."

I saw it once a day for each day it was in the theater I the small town where I live. Each time I see a new detail, a new simmer in deep waters of its thematic import. Red is passion.

Emotion. <br/><br/>This is Del Toro's masterpiece and one of the very few best picture winners that Oscars got exactly right. It is not for everyone. In a lot of ways it is a very weird film, a cross between French art house cinema, a Sirk melodrama and the universal sci-fi films of the 50's.

","On the face of it, The Shape of Water is a romantic fairy tale for adults, full of many elements, including love, violence, power struggle, and mystery, but that's not the whole story - It is not just a love story.

Sure enough, they are forced to be muted, just like Elisa, compared to the colonel whose two fingers are broken off. Except for these three, here comes a more marginalized one, Amphibian Man.<br/><br/>I believe every audience doesn't like Amphibian Man at the very beginning, even feel disgusting on seeing the picture of it. However, during the course of watching this movie, you may gradually recognize it, getting more and more positive impression from the interaction between Elisa and the Amphibian Man.

"DuskShadow","3","3","8","18 March 2018"," Not your Average Creature from the black Lag - Hellboy Prequel...
","SO yah, some people literally thought this would be a prequel to the hellboy series, focusing mainly on his sidekick Abe Sapien, as the similarities in biology, features and life in captivity between the two ""merfolk"". 
But its not, and Del Toro never said it was...but lets be honest, its a movie by him with a creature almost the same. HE knew what he was doing.
As if the paltry acting of the main actress was anywhere near Helen Keller-ish, it was more agonizing to see sign language when most people can barely ""say"" their name using the silent skill. <br/><br/>And yes, the gal has sex with the creature. She was so hard up, I was almost relieved she didnt try to lure the neighbors cats into some nefarious and unseemly situation. But it was pathetic non the less.
But people are guilted into sympathy because of the state of the main characters, all of whom have problems folks can relate to. And most people have way bigger problems than those within this film. The main antagonist , however, had my sympathies more than anyone else in this. He was not a terribly bad person, but his path as a soldier had molded him into... a soldier, believing he is always doing his duty, but trying to learn how to be positive. The film shows us that he could change given the chance, but then a fish creature ups and chews off his fingers. NO true sign of higher intelligence, and its not human. Cthulhu responsible? Perhaps, but I would have much preferred a film about lovecraftian eldritch gods than this. I think most would agree.
But somebody just HAS to win an oscar...every single year, no matter what, so whom cares, right? Just give directors and everyone else in Hollywood a more inflated ego over nonsense. 
If you like that Del Toro esque feel in a movie and dont mind garbage, watch this. Otherwise you could spend your time better on a deep documentary or film about real existential crisis' or issues more important to our current age. Or a real comedy thats enjoyable and worth remembering."

","I saw ""The Shape of Water"", starring Sally Hawkins-Paddington, Godzilla_2014; Michael Shannon-Nocturnal Animals, Batman v Superman:Dawn of Justice; Richard Jenkins-Kong:Skull Island, Step Brothers and Octavia Spencer-Hidden Figures, Snowpiercer.
This is a sci-fi romantic movie that is written & directed by Guillermo del Toro-Pacific Rim, Pan's Labyrinth, Hellboy. It's set in the 1960's when the cold war was going full speed. Sally is a mute janitor-she can hear but not speak-that works at a research facility with Octavia. Michael is a man that captured an aquatic creature in the jungles of the Amazon and has brought it to the facility to have it researched. FYI: The creature looks kind of like the creature from the black lagoon, only more detailed. Michael wants to dissect the creature and find out what makes him tick. Sally befriends the creature-she even teaches it sign language-and wants to save it so she enlists her neighbor and close friend, Richard, along with her co-worker, Octavia to pull off an Ocean's Eleven. There is also a side-plot about the Russians wanting to get their hands on the creature, too-remember, it's the cold war. The creature looks great-he reminded me of Abe Sapien from Hellboy and in fact, the same actor played both parts, Doug Jones-but the story just didn't cut the mustard with me. I could have used more action and less romance.
It's rated ""R"" for violence, language and sexual content-including nudity-and has a running time of 2 hours & 3 minutes.
It's not one that I'd buy on DVD but it would be alright, as a rental."

"Horst_In_Translation","6","4","13","22 March 2018"," It is a good film, but it basically never reaches greatness
","""The Shape of Water"" is a new American movie that is mostly in the English language, but also includes a great deal of sign language due to the protagonist's muteness and also minor parts in Russian and even French. These 2 hours are the Best Picture Academy Award winner this year, which was not necessarily a surprise on Oscar night, but may have been if we take a look at its awards recognition on other occasions. It is basically only the PGA that was a strong indicator here as the film lost out at the BAFTAs and Golden Globes and was not even nominated for Best Ensemble at the SAGs. But the Oscars loved it for sure looking at the 3 acting nominations as well as the screenplay nod, even if it never had a chance in any of these 4 categories, but still it took home 3 more Oscars including a Best Director win for Guillermo del Toro, who never was really in doubt, and who joins Cuaron and Gonzalez Inarritu in what is a great decade for Mexican filmmakers at the Oscars, not just a great night for Mexico in general at the Oscars this year. Finally, in terms of the acting nominations: I am happy for Hawkins as she is really good and also she has a very unusual kind of physical attractiveness. Not sure if she is better than in her painter movie this year, but she is excellent in both. As for Richard Jenkins, I quite like him and even if his turn here maybe profited more from his character being so likable than from a truly great performance, it's nice to see him get in a second time. Spencer was okay, but not awards-worthy and it's baffling to me what the Academy keeps seeing in her. It's a bit sad to see that Michael Shannon (quite liked the way they categorized him as the monster and not the creature from the water) never really had a shot at a nomination as he may be giving the exact opposite to Jenkins here, perhaps the best villain portrayal of 2017 and his character feels a bit similar at times to the one he portrayed on Boardwalk Empire, at least during the early seasons. In general you can say here that the characters do not really have shades apart from Stuhlbarg's perhaps, if at all, but that it does not hurt the movie as a whole in my opinion.<br/><br/>Now away from the awards, this was a good watch, but best of the year I cannot agree. The characters are all interesting to follow and you easily wonder what happens next to them, but there are weaknesses and actually not just one or two. The depiction of violence is not a problem at all, but rather helps the film, but from the romantic perspective, the film was a disappointment to me. The way the two get closer was not depicted too realistically I must say. It felt pretty rushed and as a consequence, everything else about the love story element apart from the slightly awkward sexual references feels not too convincing. Another problem I had was with the protagonist's singing moment, when we finally hear her speak and even portray a number. This was clearly intended as one of the most touching and memorable moments, but this also did nothing for me because the character of Elisa is defined through her muteness, but never in a negative way or anything. It is what makes her and so the moment she loses her defining trait is one that had more of a negative touch to it for me because there is never the feeling that she is actually unhappy the way she is. And what is him eating a cat in one scene, then cuddling another in the next and they just let him near it. Sure they don't want him to feel like a caged animal again, but still. The reference with the scars at the neck turning into gills is fine, I actually thought of gills early on. The ending story-wise and visually is fine too and it makes a strong connection to the (somewhat) happy ending, even if the poem did very little for me. Maybe it is better in the English version as I watched the German dub. Another interesting aspect here is the use of water (and fluids) on so many occasions that makes the slightly sub-par title a bit better I guess. As for the creature itself, it is another example of Del Toro delivering in terms of fantastic creatures. The looks are really spectacular for this film and it is in general maybe where it is best. Close to flawless from the directing perspective, but sadly many flaws with the script that is also by Del Toro, at least as a co-writer. I think it is a bit ironic that this may be the man's career-defining work eventually, at least at this point as a Best Picture winner because I think he has not only done better in his career in general, but especially in the fantasy genre. It is one of the weaker Best Picture winners in recent years I'd say, but still a solid watch. Not too surprised the Academy liked it with its historic references, political references, grown-up moments in terms of violence and sexuality, statements on homosexuality and discrimination against Blacks and generally its message in support of underdogs regardless if we are talking about the creature (the shape of water?) or Hawkins' character. So I see why it won over the in my opinion superior Get Out and Three Billboards. Nonetheless, of course I recommend checking out ""The Shape of Water"" as this was a very entertaining over 120 minutes, especially with Shannon's character going full rogue towards the end, even if it is not the high-quality love story I wanted it to be. Thumbs up."

"lucwindsurf","9","3","9","16 September 2018"," A poem instead of prose. (Only minor spoilers)
","Going by the reviews, it seems that people either love or hate this movie. Personally I belong to the latter category, however I do understand some of the complaints people have about the movie. The first thing that you should know is that it's very much unlike most other work by Del Toro. Just the opening scene made that abundently clear to me. Although sometimes his characteristic style rears it's head, for me this film felt like a Jeunet picture. The cinematography, his use of colour the fantastical elements in the story. Especially the way our protagonist is introduced is very reminiscent of Jeunet's earlier work. Most of the criticisms I've read about this movie are about the storytelling, that the story itself is not credible in the way that it's presented, which is true. Personally however, I feel like that is one of the movie's greatest strenghts, not a weakness. Del Toro depicts a lot of events that would be completely impossible, or at least incredible in the real world. The most striking one of those is when the main protagonist floods the bathroom by letting the tap run and stuffing some towels under the doorseal, making the water almost touch the ceiling. Ofcourse this is completely unbelievable when the viewer remains too grounded in reality. It's also one of the films most powerful moments, both in storytelling and cinematography. The movie does contain quite a few elements that aren't unlike a fairytale. The main antagonist (or villain) is a larger than life depiction of evil, who has basically no redeeming qualities, the movie is at times quite moralistic and love plays a key-role in the story. The story was never meant to be believable or science-fiction-like. It's using the setting as a vessel to tell an adult fairytale (that admittedly can be a bit too sweet at times) and it's using Del Toro's brilliant camerawork more to convey feelings than story-elements. I feel like it's necessary that the viewer understands this, in order to truly appreciate this movie. It is a poem instead of a novel."
"GoldenBlunderbuss","8","3","9","1 August 2018"," A classic story with olden-days villains that draws parallels with today's troubles
","A mute cleaner in a secret US government Cold War bunker falls in love with a captured sea creature and works with her outcast friends to help him escape.<br/><br/>There's only one to describe The Shape of Water - it's part love story, part fantasy tale, part spy drama and part heist movie. It's also an artsy film with plenty of little details for those who like to look for subtext ... The idea for the film came when director Guillermo del Toro was asked to write a film based on the Creature from the Black Lagoon, but opted for a story where the creature and the woman he kidnaps fall in love. The studio refused the idea and so it lay dormant, until now - bet they wish they went with it now!<br/><br/>At the start, you hate Michael Shannon's Strickland because you're not given a choice; he's sexist, racist and doesn't wash his hands after using the bathroom. By the end, you still hate him because he hasn't changed. And that might be the film's biggest failing, the 'villain' is given nothing to do besides be the guy who interrogates the creature and berates the main characters as he investigates its disappearance. Shannon is a great (but still grossly underrated) actor so it's a shame that he wasn't given more reign to develop a more interesting character.<br/><br/>In short, it's a simple tale told complexly - some will find this an annoying trope of a director who looks for the unusual in all his work, while others will appreciate the multiple levels of subtext in every frame and every line of dialogue.<br/><br/>Best Quote: ""He doesn't know what I lack, or how I am incomplete. He's happy to see me, every time, every day. Now, I can save him ... or let him die."""

","What a load of corny, derivative tosh this turned out to be. I can understand why it won an Oscar for production design, but, best film? No way.<br/><br/>It initially mad me think of Amelie. It has that kind of not-quite-reality feel about it. So it was good to look at, with nice music, but nasty violence and an inevitable Bad Guy. Why do American films always have to have a Bad Guy? Usually the military.<br/><br/>I failed to feel any sympathy with anyone except for Octavia Spencer's character, Zelda. Everyone else had An Agenda. And, as usual, the whole thing is, sadly, reduced to firearms.<br/><br/>Interesting to see good old Nigel Bennett from Wolverhampton (UK) playing a Russian. Not sure how good his accent was, but probably not as good as the genuine Russians in The Americans.<br/><br/>Why are films built up so much by critics only to be a disappointment? The films critics hate also seem to do better at the box office."

"Wirxaw","6","3","9","7 March 2018"," The Shape of Jellybean
","Was this really directed by Del Torro? I'm pretty sure the script was written by Seth McFarlane. Because this has to got to the most sexual movie I've ever seen. And I've watch South Park, Scary Movie, Fifty Shades of Black and FDR: American Bada**. And liked all of them. This is a new low. The plot is so thin and barebone that I wonder what's dumber, Attraction or this. But I'm 100% sure neither is remotely worth an Oscar.<br/><br/>Is the movie beautifully shot? Yes. Indeed. Is it well-acted? Sort of, the three faces try to follow their characters, although they aren't presented with much difficulty. So, yes, for the fans of blatant romance shot beautifully, Fifty Shades of Grey style and all that - 6\10, right there.<br/><br/>But for an Oscar? Interstellar didn't win an Oscar. And that movie had a palette of actors across multiple plots, while being, that's right ""interstellar and sciency"". So how can this one-page script, disgorged by the insane amounts of obscenity, be a winner? It's not like it had a lot of opposition, but... even Oldman in a fat suit might be better.<br/><br/>So what's all this obscenity? Well, besides not shying away from full frontal nudity, the movie depicts female m*stur*ation routine, discusses male toilet habits, manages to squeeze in homophobia and even certain kinky s*x approaches. It takes time to explain how ""fish stick""(for those, who get this precise South Park reference) works and how low women can fall in life.<br/><br/>Yet, you know what's probably the worst part of the movie? As it is for most romantic movies? It's absolutely stupid to anyone, who doesn't get a boner from it. Like, Avatar, Attraction, you name it, you always root for the bad guy. Because their position is correct. See, in this movie, the pathetically infatuated p*sswiper, who can get around a secret facility better than James Bond, and who just can't search for a man even if it killed her - manages to kill a number of people, to ruin a perfectly happy family, to prevent proper scientific breakthroughs and even to ruin her friends' lives. Because I'm pretty sure the police will have a swell day with that old g*y guy and the black friend of hers.<br/><br/>Once again, what could've been a beautifully shot Sci-Fi movie with possible s*xual subplot, with proper characters, happy ending, twists and revelations - ended up in nonsense. Everything was there, it would just take a few chess pieces moved around and you'd have a proper Oscar candidate.<br/><br/>The scientist was a perfect man for our heroine, the fish guy could very well be an interest, but only an interest. Not to the point of risking ""everything"" by flooding the apartment to have s*x in the bathroom. Present your findings to the scientist. Let him talk the bad guy out of the operation. Let the bad guy talk the general out of the operation. Coerce the fish guy to show his healing powers. Research them, trying to make sure that the subject doesn't die. Show a number of personality changes that can affect even that black friend's life(which is constantly mentioned, but goes nowhere). Maybe I'm a s*cker for happy ending, but a happy ending after enough troubles - is worth it.<br/><br/>Yet a dramatic ending after a load of bullkak - is not. Because this is what the movie is. A lot of incredibly stupid, obscene, forced, fabricated drama - just to have a Disney ending. If this thing won an Oscar, I will never, ever, feel bad about p*rating a movie. Because the industry is becoming something that feeds itself. It's not about quality, about public reception, about supporting the movie. It's about advertisement, paid reviews and proper nominations. This is what pays for the whole thing. That is basically ""Straight to DVD"" to me.<br/><br/>On a final note... I can't remember a single sound piece from the movie. It was all about the old musicals. So... was it De-splat... or De-splash? Oh, and, that thing ate a cat. It doesn't deserve to live to begin with. Because a cat eats a fish, not the other way around. See, if the movie doesn't want to be sane, why do I have to?"
"rapharris-57957","5","3","9","4 February 2018"," Mediocre and disappointing
","I really wanted to like this movie. However, there were certain elements that made that impossible. <br/><br/>1. The overuse of nudity and sex. A movie can show love/attraction between two characters and still be classy. For example, in the movie ""Wind River"", the attraction between the two main leads is noticeable but handled in a very appropriate way. <br/><br/>2 The constantly shifting tones. It seemed like Guillermo was trying to combine fairy tale, horror, and gothic elements into one. At least ""Pacific Rim"" knew what it was (i.e. a movie about big robots beating up big monsters).<br/><br/>However, there were some things that I did enjoy. Most of it was centered around the technical elements of the film. I also have to give credit to Doug Jones. I thought his performance was very good considering the material that he was given. 
This is not a Oscar worthy movie by any means. But, it is not a bomb. There are moments that were very effective. Unfortunately those moments are sporadic making the overall movie forgettable."

The ancient theme of love conquers all, while well-worn, still has a place in today's world, and this film does a wonderful job of addressing the fragility and nature of misunderstood love.

","Having to overcome the more dated sleazy image of Creature from the Black Lagoon (1954), Shape of Water makes its own more artful humanistic debut. Using a glamourized period artistic style of the 1940s and 1950s director Guillermo del Toro of Chronos (1993) and Hellboy (2004), has built upon the retro silent movie cinema of The Artist (2011) with the delightful period elements of the romantic comedy Down with Love (2003). This is a whimsical but also penetratingly stark reflection of the social divides that resonated and still persist in America today such as depicted in Hidden Figures (2016) and The Help (2011) which both also starred Octavia Spencer that is in this movie. Towards the end of the movie, like the delightful romantic comedy, Shape of Water also includes an elegant surrealistic period sequence. The only glaring discord arises with a most difficult to portray verbal thoughts of the mute star of the movie when director del Toro resorts to having Richard Jenkin's character having to literally repeat Sally Hawkins's character's important speech scene. At times much darker than typical expected, this sci fi/monster movie offers up a revealing and perhaps profound statement about prejudice and humanity as also depicted in two other small, independent movie pieces Wavelength (1983), an engaging early sci fi movie about children's attempt to save captured space aliens and Artic Heart (2016) which just happens to be a contemporary synthesized creature version of Shape of Water. Shape of Water is a meaningful, romanticized fantastic fairytale of the darker aspects of American society."

I didn't care for the characters, Octavia Spencer's talent was wasted, and it was predictable. I began watching the clock, waiting and hoping it would end soon.
Having seen 'The Creature from the Black Lagoon', I'd have to say that film was way more entertaining.
The only shocking thing about this film was the fair amount of nudity and swearing, involved.

","The first time I saw a Guilermo Del Toro movie was Cronos, which was on Syfy (back when it was the Sci-Fi Channel), and enjoyed it. The first one I saw in the theater was Hellboy and its sequel, and in between i saw his first spanish language movie Pan's Labryinth, which was well done. He then created Pacific Rim and that was a great movie (the sequel sucked). His most recent movie, The Shape of Water, became the first original movie in awhile to win Best Picture at the Oscars this year, becoming the first fantasy romantic drama with sci-fi elements to win it. I finally saw it on blu-ray and thought it was well done, despite its slow place and some graphic sex scenes mixed in with violence and harsh language that is not appropriate for kids. The casting in this movie is well done, and Sally Hawkins is now my celeb crush. She kinda reminds me of my teacher crush in high school years ago. Doug Jones, best known as playing Abe in the hellboy movies, delivers as the merman whose mission in the end is to fall in love with the woman of his dreams and makes her a mermaid with gills on her neck. The soundtrack is well done, and the cinematography is excellent for a moderately budgeted art film. Do yourself a favor and rent this movie or watch it on pay tv and you'll see why The Shape of Water is the best of Del Toro's films."

"davideo-2","9","2","5","7 August 2018"," Guillermo del Toro delivers another dazzling fantasy, this time with a powerful heart
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning<br/><br/>Elisa (Sally Hawkins) is a mute woman, only able to communicate through sign language. The only person who really understands her is her friend Zelda (Octavia Spencer), who works with her as a cleaner at a top secret research facility, where experiments are being carried out on the otherworldly Amphibian Man (Doug Jones.) Elisa comes to form a bond with this beautiful creature and becomes involved in a plot to break him free, setting her on a path with Richard Strickland (Michael Shannon), a ruthless senior employee at the place she works.<br/><br/>Guillermo del Toro returns out of nowhere, writing and directing this whimsical little slice of fantasy that further showcases his talents as a filmmaker. After becoming known for action adventure fantasies, such as the Hellboy films and Pan's Labyrinth, here he delivers something with more of a beating emotional heart at its core, that seems to have an equalities agenda beating at its heart, with a lead character who uses sign language, living with a closet homosexual, and being best friends with a woman of colour, at a time when this group in society were stuck in menial, dead end jobs they had little hope of getting out of, whilst straight white men really ruled the world. <br/><br/>In spite of the typically incredible special effects job done on the Amphibian Man, which don't forget to give him the sweetest, most endearing facial features, its the performances that drive the film, and in the lead role, Hawkins is perfectly cast evoking the right amount of empathy, vulnerability and compassion from this character, making her at times feel even more alien than the creature. By contrast, Shannon, although playing to type, is no less cold and scary as the unfeeling authoritarian determined to keep everything in his twisted version of order.<br/><br/>
If you can overlook the blatant political correctness, a tiresome and not entirely necessary subplot involving Russian espionage, and the ambiguous but no doubt unwholesome definition of what a woman having sex with some alien thing could be called (beasteality?!?), then this is a stirring and sensational piece of work that, as well as being a dazzling visual experience, perfectly challenges the social attitudes and prejudices of its early 1960s setting. ****"

"adam-may-bower","9","2","5","2 June 2018"," Beautifully Unique
","'The Shape of Water' is a beautiful unique love tale, that is delivered with a stellar performance by Sally Hawkins and fantastic direction by Guillermo del Toro. It's difficult to pinpoint my favourite aspect of this film, because it's wonderful in almost every way. To start off with, Sally Hawkins Oscar-nominated performance is worthy of all it's praise as she brings her peculiar, yet likeable character to life effortlessly. Playing a mute character who falls in love with a creature is a fairly difficult task to handle, but Hawkins pulls it off flawlessly, while also being backed up by great performances by Michael Shannon and Michael Stuhlbarg. While I did enjoy Octavia Spencer in this film, I am quite surprised by her Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actress as her character was a little too reminiscent of her character in the film 'The Help' and was rather stereotypical. Still love her though. Additionally, Doug Jones is obviously unrecognisable in this film as the Amphibian Man, but certainly deserves recognition for his fantastic and heartbreaking performance of the creature. Del Toro's direction in this film is once again, fantastic. While it certainly wasn't a surprise that the direction in this film was going to be good, given the critical acclaim it has received as well as the fact that it is Guillermo del Toro, it was obviously reassuring to see how beautiful Del Toro made this film. His direction, accompanied by the gorgeous cinematography by Dan Laustsen, makes this film a visual delight. But what really visually stands out is the creature this film is based around. The costume design and makeup make are outstanding, as the creature is so intriguing and rather beautiful. It would be something you'd gaze at for hours at an aquarium, and thus it was captivating every time the creature was in a scene. The plot of the film was nothing to complain about, with just enough plot twists and surprises to keep it from being clichéd and a rehash of other monster/romance films. Lastly, the music in this film is worthy of mention; the score by Alexandre Desplat and the selection of 1960's music mix beautifully into the atmosphere of the film. In saying all this, this film is a delight in almost every way and is certainly well deserving of it's 13 nominations, including Best Picture."
"MJB784","7","2","5","21 May 2018"," An interesting shape
","It was good, but I didn't love it since some of it dragged. They didn't explain how the amphibian was used as a weapon from the Soviets. In fact, the political aspects dragged, but the relationship with the creature and girl were very well done and it had some very good visuals. It tried to cover a few too many subplots and some of the pacing dragged, but beautifully filmed. I don't think it's Del Toro' s best."
"gogarrett","7","2","5","1 May 2018"," Exploration into a myriad of prejudices and discrimination against anyone with differences
","The movie ranked highly for me in being well acted and artistically framed. The message was clear. The movie was set in a time we can safely think we have evolved away from, to more easily show the cruelties of prejudice and discrimination toward job rank and education, people with disabilities, women, people of color, homosexuals, people who believe differently (the Russian scientist) and non-humans. The crazed ""villian"" was motivated mostly by his ambition and his extreme limitations as a person, not because he was evil. It was surreal seeing him in his happy 50's or early 60's home environment, as if his family had no clue to who he was. I wished the movie included a truly fleshed out back story for the characters, especially the two lovers. All of the central characters gave us bits and pieces of their backstory, but not enough for me to really latch onto and feel engaged enough to care deeply about them. I think that would have helped me in this story. I do like how the artist friend speaks his assumptions about how it ended for the lovers, however I am not sure that was to be believed. I would not care to watch this movie again. Final opinion of the movie: A message movie which is artistic and sometimes beautiful, yet heavy handed at the same time."
"invisible_sk","5","2","5","28 March 2018"," A potential masterpiece that starts great but is utterly ruined.
","I feel like Del Toro rewrote the movie around act 3 to suit the current time's issues and agendas to be a part of the bandwagon and thus ruined what was originally destined to be a true masterpiece.<br/><br/>There are movies that were originally meant to be about a female group (sex and the city, the devil wears prada), a character or a relationship was meant to be gay or lesbian (brokeback mountain, gigli) and they fit, or even a love story of completely different worlds or species (beauty and the beast, casper) and it isn't forced or out of place. It isn't uncomfortable or vulgar, they were not made to jump on a bandwagon, to solely fit the current global agendas or issues, they were purely about the art and the story they told. They were great movies and depicted a proper portrayal and a true image of the concepts they told the stories of.<br/><br/>In contrast we now have movies that are solely created to jump on the bandwagon, to fit an agenda or forcefully incorporate them while uncomfortably out of place, all female reboots (Ghostbusters, Ocean's 8), gay and lesbian relationships forced into scripts with almost no true chemistry of love or affection between them in countless shows and movies, and movies such as this where interspecies relationships are depicted so out of place and distastefully, so vulgar and lacking true chemistry that it's simply uncomfortable.<br/><br/>I am all for LGBT rights. But it's very obvious this movie wasn't meant to be about that, but somewhere along the line Del Toro seems to have steered the movie off it's original course to be a part of that bandwagon and it's very obvious how they were forced. You see, your likelihood of winning oscars skyrocket when you fit the current agendas set by the industries involved.<br/><br/>That's exactly what happened here.<br/><br/>Beauty and the beast did it right, this movie did it distastefully and uncomfortably.<br/><br/>A potential masterpiece of art ruined by external agendas.<br/><br/>Shame on you Del Toro."
"blumdeluxe","6","2","5","21 March 2018"," Nice film but a bit over-interpreted
","""The Shape of Water"" tells the story of a young woman, who works as a cleaning lady in a state laboratory and becomes witness of a fish-like human creature that the scientists are trying to gain knowledge about. As she spends more time around the creature, she notices how rough he gets treated and starts to secretly take care of it. Soon after, grave injuries lead her to the decision to rescue the man and hide him, already deeply in love.<br/><br/>It is without question a nice film with many pittoresque details and even as I am really not a fan of the producer's other films, I have to admit that it clearly has its moments. However, this movie is praised as a unique story about racism and its consequences and that it is not. Of course on a certain level the treatment of this creature can be considered racism but really this is just a love story between a human and what seems to be a frightening creature at first, just as, and I'm sorry to say that, Shrek or Avatar are. That doesn't make it a bad movie, it just shows that you shouldn't over-interpret films just because there are big names behind it.<br/><br/>All in all you can surely watch this film and you won't regre it, just don't expect it to be something it's not and enjoy what it is, instead."
"kuarinofu","5","2","5","14 March 2018"," Social justice stereotypes wrapped into great visuals
","Guillermo del Toro was always a master of adaptation of fairy tales to the big screen. In my opinion, his stronger side was always the visuals. Pan's Labyrinth - beautiful, Crimson Peak - gorgeous, Cronos - eerie yet still stylish. You can go on and on. Even when he was in just for the money, like in Pacific Rim, he was still competent at what he was doing. Everybody needs money to pursue their dreams.<br/><br/>
I decided to check The Shape of Water mostly because of Oscars. I didn't expect much since Oscars is not really what it used to be anymore.<br/><br/>
Everything regarding style and production was masterfully done. Great costume design, color correction, the feel of the 60s, nice creature effects, every scene had rich backgrounds, very living film overall. I was surprised with the work they've done with this budget, very professional. <br/><br/>
However, the story wasn't on par with everything else. If you just watch it and don't dig deep it's fine, but if you look just a little into it - it loses all the charm. It felt less a fairy tale story and more like a complex of the most trendy political ideas. The formula is very simple - white male (sexist, racist, violent, power hungry member of the consumer society) oppresses everyone else. The main antagonist is just a hyperbolic mix of all the negative qualities and ideas. Everyone else is being oppressed, the mute, because she's a mute and a woman, the fishman, because he's different, the African-american woman, because of her race and because she's a woman, the old poster artist, because he's gay etc. The guy even treats his wife like a piece of meat, and he is of course a rapist. And the icing on the cake was feminism. The scene with the African-american janitor lady's husband. The portrayal of him as an absolutely worthless human being, who won't even stand from his TV chair to protect his wife, amazing. I also loved the high ranking military official portrayed as a dumb self-confident murderer.<br/><br/>
A lot of effort is put in to make sure that you would feel guilty for just being straight white male. This was the message of the movie and it would've been a lesser evil if they would just approach it a little less biased. Just show real people instead of robots filled with stereotypes. Instead we get a perfect main heroine and her sidekicks against the evil of white male domination."
"silvermistvio","6","2","5","9 March 2018"," Although this film got best picture Oscar award, it doesn't that much good.
","I didn't have my hope that high because it says drama on genre, but I must admit that this film turned out good. The plot was so simple, but even at the nearly end, it still gave me some excitement. But since it's about love and drama, yeah, it's sort of boring for me. But it wasn't as boring as Blade Runner 2049. At least I could finish it in a day. <br/><br/>I only watched this film because it was Oscar's best picture and it got three more Oscars. So, I wanted to find out how it was the best. But after I watched it, I had a little bit of disappointment. To be honest, it wasn't the best. Maybe it's because I'm not that much into love stories and dramas. If I was, I might say this film is one of the best just like some people said.<br/><br/>This film showed the love could occur in different situations and even between different species. There's nothing to consider when it comes to true love. I might think like that if I'm into love stories and such those things.<br/><br/>There were basically two main things I don't like. One was the completely naked scene and the other was sex scenes. As for me, my aunt is kind of conservative, so, I was lucky that I didn't watch this film with her. I watched alone. Thus, no one could scold me about I'm watching films with adult contents. I prefer if there were no such scenes.<br/><br/>All in all, this film is on average. If you are kind of into love stories and true love those kind of stuffs, this film could be a good one for you. But as for me, it was just normal film. So, 6 stars only."
"linannwest","6","2","5","7 March 2018"," I wasn't convinced.
","So I decided to watch this movie after hearing all the hype surrounding it, and I have to say I wasn't completely taken away by it... let alone convinced of the love connection between the amphibious man and the mute leading lady Elisa. The acting was well done and graphics visually pleasing, but that's all I really liked about this movie. It was a neat story but by the end I found myself asking, ""Was the amphibious man really in love with the mute woman, or taking advantage of the situation?"" Think about it, Elisa was mute and the amphibious man was mute so yes she connected with him in that sense, but other than that, it was just her telling everyone how much she loved him and we were supposed to believe it. I think there's two types of Romance movies- one being where the characters tell each other how much they love each other and you're supposed to buy it, and two being where the characters express their love for one another with words AND actions. I feel like showing says more than saying. Take La La Land for example, both Sebastian and Mia made the ultimate sacrifice for each other in the name of love. Overall this was an entertaining movie to watch, however I've seen more plausible love stories."

This is clever while taking a sinister shot at the military and God, an all too common theme these days. There are many subjects tacked here, bestiality being among the crudest.

","***SPOILER FREE REVIEW BELLOW!***
I watched this movie not seeing any of the trailers but only knowing about its huge hype especially now when the oscars season comes. I knew the premise for this movie so thinking about it before the movie played I was pretty much imagining the whole film in my mind. And most of what I imagined the movie to be, it was. And you might say: Oh, that's a good thing that a movie matched your expectations. But to be honest judging by the hype this movie got and by the number of awards it got I was expecting the movie to surpass my expectations. Not to say that I don't like the movie, I enjoyed it but if you've seen most of the best movies out there you pretty much seen this movie too. And that's one of the first things that bothered me with this movie... that it had so many cliches just to make the plot go forward but in retrospective when I think about them it kinda makes me wonder how could the critics find this movie soo spectacularly awesome? Next thing is the weird scene transition... which bothered me in the beginning of the movie... it was so hard to see who each character was and the point of certain sub plots to the whole story of the movie. Another thing that bothered me was the nudity, blood, gore, violence and language that were used in this movie. It's just in plain contrast with the rest of the movie which is a sweet fairy tale. Other aspects I didn't like involve spoilers, so check them out bellow. So moving to what I liked: For me the actor that made this movie enjoyable was Michael Shannon. He gave one of his greatest performances ever. Extremely realistic and with a lot of depth he made this movie better for me honestly. Sally's performance was good but nothing special really compared to Michael and to see the academy nominating Richard Jenkins for best supporting actor is stupid to say the least compared to Michael Shannon. The cinematography was good although I didn't understand the use of dark and half shadows on almost every scene with a face in it. The amphibian for me seemed only like a plot tool and I didn't care so much for it but I'll talk more about that in my spoiler part. The story was good and entertaining with some boring parts in the beginning but with some fantastic scenes in the second and third act. All in all a very entertaining movie with great performances and a somewhat good story (although it has been seen in a whole bunch of other movies) that I would recommend to all those seeking a romantic fairy tale told in a more realistic and mature way.<br/><br/>***SPOILER REVIEW BELLOW!***
So let's get real... In the scene where the amphibian runs out of Elisa's house he scratches Elisa's neighbor and somehow has enough blood to leave marks the shape of a hand with blood on walls so that Elisa could find him in an empty cinema theater? I was stunned and almost laughed at how poorly thought this scene was culminating with the empty theater which would not run a movie with no spectators now would it? Maybe only for Elisa and this creature so that they could have a sweet moment. And a final thing that bothered me before we get on to the thing that I liked was that in the beginning we see Elisa having these scars like the shape of a gills. And I was completely down for it... somehow this b*tch is going to have gills by the end of the movie. The whole picture and the fact that this movie had a amphibian creature for me screamed ""the girl will have gills by the end of the movie"" and I was completely right about it... because surprise! by the end of the movie she and the creature live happily ever after in the water as amphibian beasts. When I saw that I literally laughed my ass off. And that is what bothered me with this movie: the difference in tones: you have vulgarity, nudity and violence combined with love, romance and fairy tale that really didn't worked at all for me. What I really liked was the scene where Elisa and his neighbor are talking about the amphibian beast and how if they would let it die they won't be much different than a creature like it. That was very touching and had a lot of meaning if you were into the movie at that point. Another great scene of course is the escape scene. Until then I was mostly bored by the movie but that scene picked up the pace and the movie never slowed down from there. It was beautifully made with as few movie cliches as possible and I really liked it. The last scene was really tense with Dr. Hoffstetler getting killed and then tortured by Strickland who after that finds the beast and Elisa shoots them both but is then killed by the amphibian due to the creature regenerating powers which was kind of a plot twist since the creature healed Elisa's neighbor (shadows of The Green Mile here) so I bought it and it was really a god end to Shannon's character and a fitting one. But the end just screwed this movie for me with Elisa being resurrected as an amphibian beast to live happily ever after with her beloved beast. This was inconsistency 101 for me and I wrote more about this in the previous rows from this spoiler review. Aside that I really enjoyed the movie but it wasn't the WOW thing that every critic and the oscars are making it to be. 7/10"

NOTES
This bizarre love story marketed as a Cold War thriller executes well, but doesn't quite come together in the end, achieving a B-. I hate it when they market movies incorrectly just to get people into the theaters. It's not what you're expecting folks. Usually writer/director Guillermo del Toro is a sure thing for me, but ""The Shape of Water"" misses the mark for reasons difficult to put my finger on.
REVIEW
Sally Hawkins's Elisa Esposito in ""The Shape of Water"" is not deaf, but is unable to speak for unknown reasons and is referred to as a ""mute"" who lives an orderly, simple little life. She lives above a rickety old movie theater that never has an audience and next to Giles (a superb Richard Jenkins (come to think of it, when is he ever not superb?)). Giles is a gay man in 1962 who is self-conscious about his age and his loss of hair. Both of them are understandably lonely and outcasts. Giles is in love with the local (much younger) pie restaurateur and Elisa pleasures herself every morning in the tub like clockwork. Elisa works at a government lab cleaning the floors alongside Zelda Fuller (Octavia Spencer), who carries on one-sided conversations until it's time to clock out. One day a mysterious canister arrives trailed by the ultra-macho Richard Strickland (a sadistically sensational Michael Shannon), a government agent who dragged the thing all the way up from South America where the Amazon people worshipped it like a god. Once we see the Amphibian Man (Doug Jones) chained up, helpless as Strickland tortures him with an electric cattle prod, he doesn't seem so godlike. What starts with a sympathy Elisa has for the creature becomes an affection, as she brings him boiled eggs, teaches him sign language, and plays him records during her lunch break. This otherworldly romantic sequence is at the heart of the story, but del Toro doesn't give it time to develop leaving it weirdly misplaced among the secretive Russian spies and off-the-wall racist comments provided as atmosphere. Strickland and his boss, a five-star general, decide to kill the creature so the knowledge of whatever it is and whatever humans can learn from it won't get into the hands of the Russians. Dr. Robert Hoffstetler (Michael Stuhlbarg) pleads that it must be preserved for science. Elisa finds out and must save the Amphibian Man no matter the cost. 
If you look at all the pieces separately they're executed flawlessly. The color palate is made up of varying shades of teal (not green, teal), and is explained to be the color of the future. Strickland's car is teal, the Amphibian Man is green, the water is green, Elisa's apartment is green, the tile is green, the....you get the picture. And it's beautiful. It sets up a beautiful dreamlike tone for the story. Director of photography Dan Laustsen does excellent work making nearly every waking frame drip with water or moisture of some kind. The basement of the laboratory where Elisa and Zelda work appears to be growing moss right before your eyes. The smell of mildew translates from the screen to your unappreciative nose. All this is perfectly executed. Even the choreography of little dance numbers scattered here and there are cute and fun. Alexandre Desplat's score lifts you up and takes you on a journey to a Parisian dream where you're floating in a romantic mist. All this contributes to a dream-like beautifully greenish romantic tone.
Tone is del Toro's main problem here. There are pieces that are masterfully presented, but when they all come together they're shattered by del Toro's abrasive use of graphic images, his sexual solemnity, and his callous use of racist atmosphere. Somehow it doesn't fit together, and it's too bad, because it could've been extraordinary. This all comes to a strange end, which I found to be unsettling, but not because del Toro wanted me to feel unsettled. Maybe because the second half of the film does not fit with the first as if it's two different visions being spliced together, and the ending is the final attempt to force them together.
Hawkins as Elisa is a irresistibly charming and one can't help comparing her to Audrey Tautou in ""Amelie"" (one of my favorites). Her shyness and silence draws you in and makes you want her to be happy. Del Toro makes a point to comment on a couple of social issues rather overtly. He teaches us that the ""outcast"" or the ""other"" should not be looked down upon and deprived of human decency. He makes this clear with the use of a janitor with the inability to speak, a black female janitor, a gay man past his prime (in the 1960s), and an Amphibian Man who are all treated abhorrently by Strickland and his superiors, who represent the privileged white American male. Strickland even makes it a point to bring up that man is created in God's image, and that God looks like him, not so much Zelda, and definitely not the Amphibian Man, but him and his kind alone. Strickland represents the conservative, traditional American man with his immaculately white sunny house, his perfectly put together housewife, and his 1.5 children, which is the past, literally smelling of decay. While Elisa and the Amphibian Man represent the liberal future. A future where love knows no bounds, whether gay, straight, black, white, mute, fish, doesn't matter. 
I appreciated del Toro's messages here, and I really wanted to love this movie. I am a supporter of his and have thoroughly enjoyed his past endeavors such as ""Pacific Rim,"" ""Hellboy,"" and ""Pan's Labyrinth,"" but this most recent work fell a bit flat. The feeling I got is that this was a personal project, that del Toro cared about this story on a deeply intimate level, but it emulates the title - coming across formless and disappointingly elusive in the end."

","I was really excited to see this movie. I'm a fan of GDT, especially his movie Pan's Labyrinth. After seeing the trailer for The Shape of Water and all the hype it started receiving I knew I really wanted to see this film and boy was I disappointed when I did. I was expecting the same kind of whimsical feel / story as some of his other movies and instead got something that at times was almost absurdly laughable. Yes, this is a fairy tale but even fairy tales need to have some rhyme and reason. The movie was incredibly predictable in most parts and in other so ridiculous that even for make belief it was too contrived. There were a few bits that were inserted in for some kind of effect that were so out of place and unnecessary that it just looked silly and I found myself flat out laughing at the absurdity. I will say that all the actors did do a good job with their roles and the sets and imagery in parts was really beautiful and well done. Outside of that what I thought was going to be a magical movie turned out to be very underwhelming, making me wonder why it's receiving the praise that it is. See the trailer which is much more captivating."

","It's a bit funny what's considered to be ""art"" or a ""good movie"" nowadays.

This movie was not bad acted and it had some nice visuals. But everything else was lacking. We have a very boring looking woman, a wallflower who cannot speak, but in the first 10 minutes we see her masturbating in the bathtube, so the audience immediately knows, this woman has sexual needs like every other woman too. Yeah. Let me tell you, I love it that they insert masturbation scenes. A woman's sexuality should get more attention in general, but in this movie I felt it was not needed. It was only done to keep the audience interested in this mediocre looking woman with not much personality. I think the actress did a great job, it's the character who was just terrible. And the villain? Over the top, and of course sexually akward. The whole movie felt very ""sexual"" to me and than the love story with a beast, a water creature? Seriously? And that's supposed to melt my heart? She fells in love with him, because they are the same? She may have been mute, but she could communicate well with her environment. She even had some good friends. They were not the same by any means. Silly, really silly. And perverted, in many, many ways. I'm speechless, really. There is no future for entertainment. On a sidenote: I thought that the creature looked cheaply done. The did it better in ""Hellboy""."
"bevinchu-1","5","4","15","15 January 2018"," An inferior gender reversed version of the 1984 film ""Splash""
","I'm surprised and no one seems to have realized this is a gender reversed version of the 1984 film ""Splash"", directed by Ron Howard, starring Tom Hanks in the rescuer role, and Daryl Hannah in the ""merman"" role.<br/><br/>Consider how similar the IMDB synopsis for ""Splash"" is to the plot of ""The Shape of Water"".<br/><br/>Synopsis<br/><br/> While on a boat at Cape Cod in 1964 with his family, Allen Bauer sees something in the water and dives in, much to the alarm of his family. Unknown to them, Allen has actually seen a little mermaid. However, no one else sees her as Allen is plucked from the water and returned to his parents, much to the sadness of the mermaid as she watches the boat leave.<br/><br/> 20 years later, Allen (Tom Hanks) now runs his family's produce distribution business, as well as continues his boyish search to find true love. Along with his feelings, Allen must also contend with his lecherous but still caring brother Freddie (John Candy), who takes love a bit less seriously than his brother. Allen lives with his girlfriend but she breaks up with him over the phone, leaving Allen depressed and despondent.<br/><br/> After attending the wedding of a work associate (Bobby Di Cicco), Allen gets drunk and for some reason, decides to go to Cape Cod while his brother runs off to Rio de Janeiro with two attractive single women. Arriving at the Cape, Allen comes across a short-tempered scientist named Cornbluth (Eugene Levy), who is there to search for mermaids in the waters off the town (unknown to his two bumbling crewmembers, or Allen).<br/><br/> Allen charters a small motorboat to get to a nearby island, but a mishap sends him over the side. After almost drowning, Allen finds himself on land with a beautiful naked blonde woman (Daryl Hannah), who quickly disappears back into the water (once in the water, her legs become fins, unseen to Allen). Allen pleads to know who she is, but she does not respond.<br/><br/> In the water, the mermaid finds Allen's wallet, and swims away, but not before having a chance encounter with Cornbluth. After swimming away, she goes to a sunken ship, and using the information in his wallet and some old maps in the sunken ship, finds out where Allen lives.<br/><br/> A couple days later, Allen returns to New York, and on the same day, the mermaid shows up naked at the Statue of Liberty, with Allen's wallet. Allen receives a call from the NYPD, and heads to the station where the girl is being held. After she is released into his custody, Allen takes her to his apartment.<br/><br/> The next day, Allen shows up for work happier than usual, much to the shock of Freddie, to whom Allen decides to give more of the responsibility of the family business. Upon returning home later in the day, Allen is shocked to find the woman is missing. The doorman claims she got in a cab going to Bloomingdale's, and Allen heads there immediately. He finds her there with a whole new wardrobe, and also finds that she is now able to talk. When Allen asks how, she explains that it was by watching television in the store's electronics department. As they walk home, Allen tries to ask her where she's from, but she is scant on details, only to say that she can only stay for 6 days, before the moon is full. When asking her for a name, the concept seems foreign to the woman. As he notes that they are approaching ""Madison Ave,"" the woman decides she likes this name, and so Allen decides to call her Madison.<br/><br/> Allen then spends the next couple days away from work getting to know Madison. One evening, he hears her in the bathroom with the door locked, and the water running. When he asks to be let in, she panics and demands that he wait. Allen instead grows worried when he hears a strange thump on the floor (Madison's legs had transformed in the water and she'd flopped out of the tub), and knocks in the door, finding Madison wrapped in a towel on the floor, claiming she didn't want to let him in because she was ""shy.""<br/><br/> The next evening, Allen gets Madison a gift, and takes her out for a walk. When the come across a fountain with a mermaid on it, Allen recounts how it reminds him of something, but can't recall just what. Allen also notes that they are planning to remove the fountain and build condo's in the area, which Madison finds sad, thinking the fountain is beautiful.<br/><br/> Freddie then informs Allen that he has managed to get tickets to an dinner event that the President of the United States will attend. Allen is impressed, but asks if he can take Madison instead of Freddie along. Freddie playfully teases his brother that he's in love, but Allen insists he's not. Allen goes on to explain that he just isn't sure, and that something just seems strange when it comes to Madison, noting the incident with the TV's as well as the bathroom.<br/><br/> Meanwhile, Madison's appearance at the Statue of Liberty has made it into a local tabloid. Cornbluth sees the story, and informs his colleagues in New York. However, one of his colleagues named Dr Ross finds Cornbluth's mermaid theory to be ridiculous. Cornbluth is sure that when she is not in the water, the mermaid's fins become legs on dry land. He then sets out across New York attempting to find Madison and throw water on her. In his attempts, Cornbluth ends up offending the same couple twice and is beaten up.<br/><br/> As the days tick away before Madison leaves, Allen attempts to ask her to marry him. However, she refuses Allen's offer, and he grows irritated at her, regarding how secretive she has been about where she comes from. Madison then runs away, and Allen attempts to find her, before returning to the produce center. Shortly after arriving, Madison returns, and this time decides to accept Allen's proposal.<br/><br/> Allen is eager to get married now, but decides to do so after the event with the President, planning to drive to Maryland to wed. During the dinner, Madison decides she'll tell Allen her big secret and he agrees to leave with her so they'll have privacy. However, as the two of them are leaving the event, Cornbluth sees Madison, and ends up spraying her with water, revealing her secret to Allen, and to a contingency of press.<br/><br/> Both Allen and Madison are taken to a secret location in the New York Natural History Museum, where Allen is also suspected of being part-fish. Allen and Madison are kept in isolation, but Madison is soon put into Allen's tank. She attempts to apologize for not revealing her secret, but Allen silently refuses to listen to her.<br/><br/> After it appears he is not of Madison's species, Allen is released, only to be mobbed by press outside his apartment. Freddie manages to get Allen out of there, and they return to the office at the family business. Allen is still upset that in his search for love, the one girl he fell madly in love with has turned out to be a fish. Freddie chastises Allen for his attitude, claiming that in the last few days, his brother has been happier than he's been in years and certainly happier than (Freddie) has ever been with a woman.<br/><br/> Cornbluth meanwhile, has been allowed to view Madison, but has not been allowed to voice opinions regarding her care and well-being. The scientist in charge of project, Dr Ross, explains his plan to see how Madison reacts to other marine life before his people dissect her. Cornbluth voices his dissension, but Ross just chides him along.<br/><br/> Now feeling miserable for what he has done, Cornbluth is surprised when he is found by Allen at the dentist. Allen has decided that he loves and wants to save Madison, and needs Cornbluth's help.<br/><br/> Along with Freddie, the three of them infiltrate the lab, and make off with Madison, leaving Freddie behind to distract them for a bit. Cornbluth and the two brothers impersonate Swedish biologists and are able to bluff their way past the half-Swedish guard when Freddie speaks his language having learned it from watching watching Swedish pornography.<br/><br/> Madison's escape is soon found out, and the military begins a chase through the Manhattan streets. Cornbluth at one point jumps out in an attempt to buy some time, but ends up almost being run over.<br/><br/> Finally, off a pier on the Hudson River, Madison and Allen say their farewells, with Madison explaining to Allen that he can come with her, but if he does, he cannot come back to land. It is also here that she finally reveals that she was the little girl he saw in the waters off Cape Cod, and Allen is overjoyed to know that it was all real.<br/><br/> As the military at first closes in, Allen has Madison swim off, but as he watches her leave, he dives in after her, though he is unable to swim. Just as when he was a boy, Madison rescues Allen, but soon, the two have to contend with divers trying to stop the two of them.<br/><br/> After a small skirmish, Madison grabs Allen's hand, and they swim away. Thanks to a kiss by her, Allen is now able to breathe underwater, and after some time swimming, they make their way to a distant underwater kingdom."

Your presence fills my eyes with Your love.
It humbles my heart, 
For you are everywhere <br/><br/>The central focus of this film for me was not the romance between the 'Creature from the Blue Lagoon' and our heroine , but the conversation of what love is between the excellent leads of Sally Hawkins and Richard Jenkins. They are both outcasts in a society that has rejected them and they are desperate to connect to another. At first, their friendship and intimacy made me think that they were blood related, yet the story excellently depicts that they are lost souls joint in a cause, to loose their shackles of nialism in the love of another. Richard Jenkins becomes besotted with a young man in a cafe only to find that when the curtains are pulled down, he is left with false promise This is where the ending plays as he comments on the joy that his friend finally found what they both so badly craved for, even if it was with a merman from the deep. <br/><br/>A lot of people sniggered at the 'bathtub scene' where the two characters made love, yet the scene is validated with the presence of Richard Jenkins 'Giles' to acknowledge that although some people may mock the romance that his dearest friend has, he knows it to be true for her. <br/><br/>I was not moved until the final scene played and then I felt the hope of love that they bonded over to make such a beautiful friendship.

Visually? Well was about a one or two minute bit in the middle with some pretty colors and patterns based on water (honestly, that is the extent of it).

Well there is a pretty crass sex scene, no doubt to help establish the villain's character as a serious bad-ass, and there are three suggestive scenes of Sally Hawkins masturbating. Well, that was sort of fun. But worthy of an Oscar? Well, maybe....lol. <br/><br/>And finally, the film portrays cruelty (torture of an ""alien"" and a cute pet cat getting its head bitten off - nice) and violence (pretty graphic scenes with a taser-like device, as well as several bullet holes in bodies, necks, heads, etc.)<br/><br/>I won't give away the ending, other than to say it is entirely predictable (what did you expect, something original?)<br/><br/>Whatever happened to great movies? Don't they make them anymore? When was the last time that a really really good movie won best film. Seriously. Well how about Blade Runner 2049? Wasn't even nominated!

","Dark fantasy has been a common motif in Guillermo del Toro's movies: ""Cronos"", ""Mimic"", ""The Devil's Backbone"" and ""Pan's Labyrinth"" are the obvious examples. He continues this with the ""The Shape of Water"". At heart, 2017's Best Picture winner is about how people want to get accepted for who they are. The main human characters are a deaf woman (Sally Hawkins), a gay man (Richard Jenkins of ""Six Feet Under"" fame), and a black woman (Octavia Spencer), all representing demographics barely acknowledged in 1962 (the movie's setting). By contrast, the ""normal"" person (Michael Shannon in one of his many heavy-duty roles) puts on a facade of respectability, hiding his brutality. No surprise that Elisa can only find a soulmate in the amphibian man (Doug Jones, not to be confused with the Alabama senator).<br/><br/>All in all, this is an impressive movie, not that I would expect less from del Toro. The dark-colored settings contrast sharply with the lighthearted comedies and musicals that Elisa watches on TV. I haven't seen every Best Picture nominee, but I'd say that this was a good choice nevertheless. I recommend it.<br/><br/>Mister Ed.

What makes this seemingly implausible story work so wondrously well on screen are the sublime visuals, the soul-stirring score, and the spectacular performances by the entire cast.

","Without doubt, one of the finest movies I have watched. The scene where Elisa and her lover are caught in a passionate embrace in a room full of water by her friend Giles is one of the most intimate scenes I have watched in Hollywood for a long time. It just smacks you in the face! Brilliant cimema indeed."

"Benjamin-M-Weilert","9","2","6","8 March 2019"," An intriguing exploration of the ""monster"" genre.
","The modern master of the monster movie, Guillermo del Toro is at it again with The Shape of Water (2017). Much like the Universal Studios monster classics, del Toro has created a career around directing films about how humans interact with these monsters. From building giant robots to fight giant monsters in Pacific Rim (2013) to hiring monsters to kill other monsters in Hellboy (2004), del Toro has also occasionally shown the more human side of monsters. Or, more accurately, he has shown how monster-like humans can become.<br/><br/>Previous films by Guillermo del Toro, like Cronos (1993) and Pan's Labyrinth (2006) have highlighted the negative qualities of man while infusing these films with a sense of fantasy that can often border on straight-up fairy tales. The Shape of Water certainly falls into the ""man is the real monster"" category of del Toro's movies, but it kind of beats you over the head with it like it does with all the ""water"" motifs. In fact, speaking of beating over the head, The Shape of Water still contains the few moments of ""uncomfortable violence"" that other del Toro films usually have in them.<br/><br/>In the end, The Shape of Water is a visually beautiful and unique take on both the Swamp Monster and the Little Mermaid. I'll forgive some of the weird moments (like the dancing sequence and the impossibly strong bathroom floor) merely because the simple plot makes the audience so sympathetic for a creature that would usually be the antagonist of a monster movie. At its most basic, The Shape of Water is about love in its many forms, which might make some people uncomfortable. The fact that it's packaged like a fairy tale, with a brilliantly whimsical score by Alexandre Desplat, means this movie should at least give audiences something to think about.<br/><br/>An intriguing exploration of the ""monster"" genre, I give The Shape of Water 4.5 stars out of 5."
"Caleb_Everett","5","2","6","3 March 2019"," I mean...it's kind of whack.
","I went into this film with extremely high hopes because the movie was raved about by so many people. I have to say though, I was slightly disappointed.<br/><br/>It was shot absolutely beautifully. The aesthetics and the environments were all supremely done, they had this otherworldly sense to them that was enthralling and captivating. You can tell they didn't hold back at any point on the sets or the environments.<br/><br/>The storytelling was also done beautifully, I loved how they seemed to humanize these ""top secret"" situations by inserting everyday idle chit chat. It made the situation that normally would be grand seem so trivial, this made everything seem so utterly believable.<br/><br/>Now I'm sure you're reading all of this and wondering, ""Why were you disappointed?"" Well, for me, there were just things in the movie that didn't make a ton of sense to me, the sexual scenes for instance...why were they there? Not the ones with the ""creature"", but the others. If you subtracted them from the film, it doesn't take anything away from it. Perhaps, they were trying to humanize these characters by showing them in their most intimate settings? I can sort of understand that, but it kind of just comes across as odd to me.<br/><br/>Perhaps I'm being too critical of the scenes, I was expecting this movie to be something slightly different so I must admit my opinion is slightly skewed.<br/><br/>The storytelling and environments and the performances make this movie a GREAT watch, but sadly I can't say it's a MUST watch."
"Russcity133","10","2","6","4 February 2019"," Adorably whimsical kind of B movie themed film with dark humour and mad love story
","I can't believe it has taken me so long to get to see this movie. I did not know much about the plot, so I was very surprised, amused and strangely moved by much of the bizarre romance which unfolded between the lonely heroine and the equally lonely amphibious man-creature.<br/><br/>This movie has been sadly misunderstood by many of the reviewers, who did not realize that it was actually meant to have moments of dark comedy. It is not meant to be a serious, realistic Sci Fi movie, but it is totally believable as a love story. If this lonely, thirty-something woman did meet a lonely man-fish creature of this kind, and they had a special sign language communication, it seems credible that they might fall in love. The merman looks alien but strangely attractive, with big, jewel-like eyes and beautiful lips. He has gills which make pretty fan shapes around his head and arms.<br/><br/>The good-guy characters in this movie are warm and fully developed, likeable people. The amphibious man is weird but also very likeable. The villain is so evil that you just have to laugh at his extremes of boorishness and sadism. Some of the violence is oddly slapstick and darkly hilarious.<br/><br/>If you are prepared to suspend disbelief and enjoy the whimsical madness, violent, slapstick laughs and bizarre yet adorable romance, you will soon see why The Shape of Water won so many awards. It has the most fabulous look of the early 1960's, from the scenery, cars and clothes, even down to a slightly yellowed took to the film's colour, as if it was actually filmed in the 60's. I also think that fans of graphic (cartoon) novels will love the oddball romance of this movie. Expect the unexpected, float away and enjoy the ride. Escapism is the order of the day."

"johanna-690-69967","10","2","6","31 December 2018"," A Modern Fairytale
","Del Toro's execution of an innocent fairytale set in a less than innocent world is a delicate balancing act that pierces the viewer's cynicism and leaves them inspired and connected to their child-like wonder. The tone and sentimentality reminds me of ""Cinema Paradisio"" or ""Amelie,"" but ""The Shape of Water"" grapples with much more complex themes, such as prejudice and cruelty, and still manages to leave me charmed."

"Special-K88","Null","2","6","1 December 2018"," clearly a labor of love from a unique director
","Set in Baltimore, Maryland at the height of the Cold War, this unusual romance focuses on a lonely, mute custodian (a warm, wide-eyed Hawkins) who works at a high-security government laboratory. There, she runs afoul of a detestable military project leader (a vicious Shannon), but also forms a special bond with a captive amphibian creature. At times resembling the old silent pictures, this is an ambitious showing from director Guillermo Del Toro who creates a rich fantasy world imbued with vivid scenery, captivating characters, and deep emotional resonance. The set design is impeccable, the acting is first-rate, and the story unfolds in ways you wouldn't quite expect. Reminiscent of Beauty and the Beast this is unconventional, even a bit awkward at times, but thoughtful and touching in its own distinct way. ***"

"Cineanalyst","8","2","6","23 October 2018"," Creature from the Black Lagoon Inverted
","Perhaps slight for a Best Picture Oscar winner, its cloying simplism extending to its self-reflexivity--that movies are magical, ""The Shape of Water"" is, nonetheless, stylishly made and interestingly the inverse of the film it most pays homage to, ""Creature from the Black Lagoon"" (1954). The subject of a few plagiarism accusations, including a failed lawsuit for a play I'm not familiar with; I think the accusations of stealing from other movies tend to be overblown (as if it weren't already a prevalent practice) and overlook the dreariness of those cinematic borrowings. Not the obvious superficial similarities a romantic reworking of Universal's Gillman trilogy was bound to have as a gender reversal of ""Splash"" (1984) and ""The Little Mermaid"" (1989), either. The look, with its greens and golden light colors, not counting the addition of blue to reference water here, and the familiar sense of whimsy, rom-com quirks and simplistic characterizations, indeed, resemble ""Amélie"" (2001). By the time a French song plays after the consummation of the central romance, it would seem like the movie is more likely set in the Paris of Jean-Pierre Jeunet rather than in Baltimore, if not for the Cold War and Civil Rights politics providing bearings. Then, there's the bland wonder at movies from ""Cinema Paradiso"" (1988). It does sound and look nice, flowing camerawork included, even if it's essentially artful but immature creature-feature fan fiction complete with bathtub moments of masturbation and bestiality.<br/><br/>I appreciate the visual effects and how they add to the water theme, including shooting dry for wet for the fantastic underwater scenes, the rain drops and the water dissolves in editing. Moreover, Elisa's daily routine is built around the use of water, from her morning masturbation in the bath and, later, sex in water, to boiling eggs, from firemen turning the hoses on a factory fire to the mood-setting rainfall later, and even her workplace mopping up of men's errant urine and receiving a lecture on the implications on a man's character as to the washing of hands. The time motif, too, bends to water via the daily thoughts of her calendar expounding that, ""Time is but a river flowing from our past,"" and ""Life is but the shipwreck of our plans.""<br/><br/>The acting is fine, too, but the characters are overly simplistic. The good guys are very good, and the bad guys are very bad. Only the Russian scientist occupies a bit of gray area. Michael Shannon is typecast, once again, as the villain, his Colonel who captures the fish-man lacking about as much complexity and empathy as his General Zod from ""Man of Steel"" (2013). Octavia Spencer plays another sassy sidekick in a movie set in America's racially-segregated past, à la ""The Help"" (2011) and ""Hidden Figures"" (2016). Meanwhile, the gay neighbor appears rather childishly innocent in his escape into musicals and near retreat from the horrors of mistreated minorities. And Sally Hawkins is always fantastic, although the casting of a Brit seems a bit of a sop to the expected audience for a character that seems to be coded as ambiguously Latin American. On the other hand, having a mute character that partially relies on others (gay narrator and black coworker) to talk for her may have come across as too on the nose in alluding to Spanish-speaking immigrants in the U.S. with the casting of a Latin-American actress.<br/><br/>""The Shape of Water"" manages to be more black-and-white in its characterizations than ""Creature from the Black Lagoon,"" despite that film's 1950s sexism and colonialist underpinnings. In that original creature feature, there was one man who was somewhat unsympathetic, but everyone else, the Gillman included, had complex motives, benign and sinister characteristics. Not so here. The pie shop teller isn't only homophobic, but a racist, as well (he even has a fake Southern accent, for whatever that matters). The Colonel doesn't just mistreat ""the Asset,"" he defends his actions with Old Testament appeals to bigotry, he's misogynistic in his adulterous lust, and he even becomes physically deformed. The fingers business seems to undermine the movie's message, though, as it's essentially an old ableist trope that villains be physically crippled.<br/><br/>Otherwise, ""The Shape of Water"" is from the perspective of marginalized peoples: the protagonist, disabled by her muteness, the homosexual, the African Americans and the merman. I like that even smokers are included here--mainstream in the 1960s, but largely discriminated against today--it also reverses the cliché of cigarettes being associated with the baddies. The one here consumes candy, instead (ironic, though, that a movie that vilifies candy and pie is itself so saccharine). This is the inverse of the original Gillman trilogy, where scientific colonialists ventured to the Amazon to capture the monster. The IMDb review by TheKing87 is on the right track in regards to Elisa and the creature being the same species, including by the inference of her backstory of gill-like scars on her neck and Spanish and river-based origins. The implication is that he's human, as he was the racial ""other"" to the white American colonizers in the 1950s, as was the giant ape in ""King Kong"" (1933) before that. There was always a colonialist ideology underpinning this, and ""The Shape of Water,"" headed by its Latin-American director, reverses that doctrine.<br/><br/>This is so apt that I'm largely willing to overlook the flaws in story and self-reflexivity otherwise. I mean, the creature being cinema is too obvious--both blandly magical, even godly--culminating in a scene where he's found alone in a theatre watching a Bible movie. Even that's preferable to the Beauty-and-the-Beast love story annotated by musicals, including the fantasy sequence where Elisa dreams herself a voice. Even if not everything holds water, it's so well-shaped, to borrow from the title's allusion, by its container that's it's hard not to be swept up in it."

"catchmadhav16","7","2","6","20 June 2018"," Beating the flow.
","The possibility of rejection from a significant other, or perhaps the fear of losing them creates a distrustful and a devoid of love atmosphere. The very ideals of us not being fitful in someone's life could haunt us more than what we expected to. The Shape of water is a 120-minute poem to the transformative form of love and a masterpiece of compassion adding the fantasy element to spilling proportions. A clear blend and synthesis of influences layered over the morals of how kindness evolves love even from extreme prejudices. The established world inside the screen emanates an idiot box ambiance which catches us off guard and encourages us to throw caution and all senses of notion out of the window.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Elisa (Sally Hawkins), is a mute cleaner in a covert government agency cooped up with Zelda (Octavia Spencer), a chatty co-worker with marital issues. Enter; the man-amphibian (Doug Jones) often called ""The Asset"", is a creäture with amazing capabilities pulled out from the Amazon where it was worshiped as a God by their natives. I'll leave the abilities to amaze the viewers without further spoilers. The asset forms the main crux of the story; unlike other mindless creatures, this one is capable of perceiving human emotions. Elisa's naked innocence and kindness lead her heart to make a somersault of emotions towards the creäture fading the rest of the world behind her. The head of security of the facility, Strickland (Michael Shannon) a ruthless agent determined to terminate the Asset for study purposes is introduced as the monster who tries to pull both of the lovers away with a Zod-esque performance. Such circumstances led Elisa, her close-to-the-heart neighbor, a closeted homosexual and struggling painter, Giles (Richard Jenkins) and Zelda to orchestrate an amateur but surprisingly slick heist operation to extract the creäture from the facility. The events that follow after the heist dispatch a frenzy of unaccounted accidents and longing love from the characters.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>With a clear World War backdrop, the tension between the USA and the USSR fumes in every laboratory and strategic scene. With creature-human love themes, it certainly evokes memories from King Kong and Beauty and the Beast. However, it rises from the generic stereotype and varnishes its own color into the frame painting a picture with such vibrant colors that will make you wonder about the contents of the palette. With a tinge of B-grade romance backdrops, it does make you wonder its sanity and agenda midway aiming to make you swoon at every possible chance. The motivations and purposes of each character were beautifully folded from the deck it was presented artistically adding several layers to the otherwise simple story. A visage of masks and false fronts added by racial slurs with a pinch of religious devotion were the streaks adding to the structure of a farfetched story for the non-believers or the naysayers who proved incapable of opening their hearts to a queer romance. Clearly, this movie had no target audience, it either made you exalt at the belief of love through kindness principle or made it further absurd for the believers. After all, its beauty was an ambiguity left to the viewer to shape which varied alternately and perhaps drastically with shapes that were aesthetic for some while unpleasant for some.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The trending shared universes remind me of the recently launched Universal Studio's ""Dark Universe"" shortly canceled after the bombing of ""The Mummy"" (2017). Director Guillermo Del Toro utilizes his most used theme of monsters, outcasts, and freaks, takes a relatively generic relationship and twists it and adds his own brand. The Shape of Water is the realism of how gods and monsters fit into our mainstream world, where the supernatural elements are downplayed for good. Something that the ""Dark Universe"" tried to forcefully stuff down our throats was the possibility of mythology existing in our daily lives with an approach so absurd that made it forgettable. An extravagant thematic element like this is far more welcome when it flows through the minds and hearts rather than stomp right in our faces. The break-up of studio agreements and creative visions clearly made the difference it was supposed to make for Del Toro. With a queer cake blend of monsters, love, acceptance, and devotion, The Shape of Water can be deemed as a coming of age story. It is a fairy tale for grownups that delves into deep waters, the once taboo interspecies ardor breaking your heart and haunting your dreams."

"nairtejas","7","2","6","11 June 2018"," Molecule Review: The Shape of Water
","I'm unable to adjudge whether it is the outstanding performance of the cast or the brilliant narration of the love story that pushes The Shape of Water to the level of a classic. But I'm certainly able to call it one not because of its critical reception but because of what it aims to highlight and succeeds. Guillermo del Toro's protagonist is a mute, young woman named Elisa (Sally Hawkins) who plans to save a mystical human-like amphibian from the clutches of a government-run scientific research institute where she works, and which is managed by a sadist and unscrupulous ex-Army (Michael Shannon). It is her love and sympathy for the creature that motivates to do what she does, but Toro projects it as a connection between two creatures with their own flaws and shortcomings. The Shape of Water is purely a love story and nothing else, narrated in the classic 80s style which only uplifts its appeal. Hawkins is Godlike, but I'm without words at the impeccable performance of Richard Jenkins, Shannon, Michael Stuhlbarg, and Octavia Spencer who play more than life. They are so intricate and IN the character that more than the otherwise bland love story I was impressed by their natural skills. Together with Alexandre Desplat's melodious background score and a fitting production setup that puts James Cameron's Avatar (2009) into shame, the film goes above and beyond as to what it sets to achieve. Which is why I will recommend it to anyone who's familiar with Toro's filmography and those who simply appreciate good cinema. The Shape of Water is good cinema and we must appreciate it. TN."

"ariwebbkatanos","7","2","6","9 March 2018"," The Shape of Water by Guillermo del Toro
","I've never seen a movie directed or written by Guillermo del Toro, and my first experience with his work was a mixed one. The Shape of Water is an undoubtedly creative work, and features many unique aspects rarely seen or fleshed out in others of this caliber. While this is true, it only manages to shine a strong torch in some categories and not others. Where The Shape of Water succeeds in design, acting and soundtrack, it falls short in plot, pacing and ham-fisted themes. Without a doubt, it holds itself as a spectacle, but internally the movie struggles to keep itself together on all fronts.<br/><br/>The first and most important concept I want to touch on is how a film is designed to be ingested, on a scale of seriousness. There are films that are very clearly designed to be taken in a serious tone, like Blade Runner 2049. These films immediately establish themselves with serious themes and concepts and consistently expect themselves to be treated as such throughout. Then there are films like Death of Stalin. These films establish a comedic and lighthearted tone within the first 15 minutes at the most, and generally maintain it throughout and apply the tone to even the darker elements of the story. A consistent level of seriousness is, in my opinion, key for a great movie.<br/><br/>This is where The Shape of Water really led me astray. The film quite often jumps between comedic and grave undertones and rarely seeks to create a harmony between them. It was only by the end of the film that I finally concluded that the film was best experienced when it wasn't taken seriously. While this didn't seriously improve or detract from certain scenes in the film, it certainly made a difference on my overall enjoyment. The movie has a short and creative musical number, roughly two thirds into the film. This was the first time I realized that this film is far more lighthearted than dramatic, yet throughout the film it still presses rather grave themes.<br/><br/>On a more positive note, the overall design in The Shape of Water was amazing. With a purported budget of 20 million, it really seems to stretch every dollar. Environments and (very obviously) characters are given great care and attention throughout the whole film, and the cinematography never falls short. The actual creature itself, which I don't think is named, is superbly created. A great combination of majority practical effects and some CGI blend perfectly into a seamless and believable supernatural being. The locations were well picked and the color palette of the film remains consistent without. I have not a bad word for the visual makeup of this film.<br/><br/>What I feel very mixed on is the overall pacing of The Shape of Water. Firstly, I would like to praise the films use of its run-time. The film perfectly understands it's own genre, and doesn't waste time building suspense for the reveal of the amphibian beyond the first 20 minutes of the film. Throughout the film, there is little deviation from the topic, but yet the pacing still troubled me. Without spoiling story content, I felt that at times it moved too fast and at others took it's time far longer than necessary. I also felt that there were scenes, especially one sex scene (not the infamous one) that were seemingly unnecessary. Overall I believe the film would have benefited from a less expansive story, one that left international politics and irrelevant intrigue alone in favor of something more procedural and slower paced. Which leads me to the story.<br/><br/>The story of The Shape of Water is largely baseless. I found it entertaining, and the plot never stalled, but there were just too many significant plot points and strange character choices that betrayed the overall narrative. Themes were largely left half done/explored beyond the one central one, and what could have been seriously fascinating minor and major characters were left at the mercy of lazy plot advancement. Some elements simply would have benefited the film if they were removed entirely. There is little more I can touch on without story spoilers.The Shape of Water's acting is one of it's stronger suits, however. Sally Hawkins and Doug Jones both deliver a great performance but it was Michael Shannon, one of my favorite actors, who manages to put on the best of all despite being held back by poor characterization. None of the supporting cast pulls down the movie, and there were yet still many stand outs. I personally really enjoyed all the scenes Octavia Spencer was in as well.<br/><br/>In summary, my enjoyment of this film very much traveled up and down throughout it's duration, but raised itself significantly once I properly figured out the tone it was awkwardly trying to set. The good and bad of this film actually remarkably balances itself out and still keeps it as a very enjoyable experience overall, but nothing I would write home about. Outstanding design and acting kept me going, but couldn't recover the damage made by critical plot and pacing flaws. I'd be content giving it a 7/10."
"jonathan_stewart-38677","1","2","6","4 March 2018"," A Different Perspective
","This movie comes at a perfect time in Hollywood history. The sexual abuse scandal and subsequent ""MeToo"" movement have highlighted the sexual atrocities that have existed in Hollywood and other entertainment work place environments for decades. The abuse is disgusting for sure. But then comes this movie. To me the movie exposes the hypocrisy of Hollywood. On one hand let us rail against the sexual atrocities that have been perpetrated against women. However on the other hand let us nominate a movie for the most Oscars of the season that puts sexual perversion on a glorious pedestal. I would ask anyone supporting this film What type of society do you want America to be? One that rails against sexual injustice and values the sanctity of sex within a marriage? Or one that montetizes sex for profit in film in perverse fashion? You cannot have it both ways. The slippery slope of Hollywood producing movies of sexual perversion has reached a crescendo in this film. In society the sanctity of sex has been watered down and devalued and then abused. The only way do restore the foundation of Judeo Christian values of our country is found here in 2nd Chronicles 7:14 , ""if my people, who are called by name, will humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways, then will I hear from heaven and will forgive their sin and will heal their land."" For certain it starts with our country's leadership showing such humility and repentance. Movements last moments. Real heart change is much more radical and difficult but lasts a lifetime and transforms generations. That is what America needs. God bless."
"jtindahouse","7","2","6","4 March 2018"," Unfortunately you can tell it's trying very hard to win Oscars
","The Oscars are a funny old bird. Unfortunately after the #Oscarssowhite controversy a couple of years back they have lost a lot of credibility. They came out and made a promise to diversify the nominees/winners of the show in the future. What did that do? It meant that when a film like 'Moonlight' won Best Picture the next year people were left to question whether that was based on the merits of the film, or simply the fact that they needed the winning film to be based around black people. Now obviously people are questioning the same things over Guillermo del Toro and his film 'The Shape of Water'. Is it actually deserving or are the Academy simply trying to include the Latinos in the mix this time around? These are never questions that should be asked, but unfortunately they forever will be now. So is 'The Shape of Water' the real deal, or overrated nonsense? It's somewhere in the middle.<br/><br/>The first thing that has to be said is that this is a film that is trying very hard to win Oscars. That comes across very clearly multiple times. We all know that the Academy love a film about film, so of course part of the film is set above a movie theatre and there is completely unnecessary scene set in it. That's a part of the film I didn't like. What I did like about the film was its intelligence. When you look back afterwards and examine certain plot points and clues this is actually a very smart and well thought out film. Without getting into spoilers this is a tough thing to explore, but needless to say there is some very interesting reading up on people's theories you can do after you've seen the film.<br/><br/>'The Shape of Water' is in a two horse race to win Best Picture tomorrow with 'Three Billboards Outside Ebbing Missouri' (as I see it at least). Personally I think the latter is a far superior film and deserves the win. At then end of the day 'The Shape of Water' is a love story and I just didn't feel what I usually feel when I see the best love stories put to screen. Not a bad film, due to its intellect, but it's nothing earth shattering either."
"Pjtaylor-96-138044","8","2","6","17 February 2018"," Enjoyable and well-made, there's just this sense that we've sort of seen it before.
","'The Shape Of Water (2018)' shares similarities with Del Toro's earlier work, especially 'Pan's Labyrinth (2006)', and suffers ever so slightly because of it, notably when it comes to its forcefully 'ambiguous' end which necessarily doesn't work with the overtly (and perfectly fine) fantasy narrative laid out before it. There is also the issue that its central romance does boil down to a relationship between a human and an animal. It works fine as an allegory but in the piece as it is presented, its a bit weird. The film is a competently made one, though, and you feel in safe hands throughout, with the calm and more wholesome moments nicely counterpointed by the director's trademark outbursts of brutal violence. In fact, the flick seems like a culmination of all that this film-maker has done before, not enough to best his prior work but enough to fit nicely alongside it. Despite being a pretty generic fairy-tale at its core, it feels like it has something to say. However, it doesn't let that get in the way of it telling its entertaining story. Its very enjoyable and just as well-made. 8/10"
"cruise01","6","2","6","3 January 2018"," A flawless story but slow and boring at times.
","The Shape of Water shows Guillermo del Toro visionary direction of a tale that is a love story with a bit of fantasy. The film does well with its storytelling, interesting characters, the concept of a creature that looks like it came out of Creature from the Black Lagoon falling for a mute girl. <br/><br/>Guillermo del Toro script does well with its storytelling. A girl falling in love with a sea creature. Elisa (Sally Hawkins) is a mute girl that works at a factory that is mostly kept secret with the experiments done within the facility. Elisa goes day by day, waking up and being lonely, she even has a set timer for her self fun time, and she works and after spending time with her lonely neighbor Giles (Richard Jenkins). Giles is obsessed with key lime pies that he keeps in his fridge, which is a lot of pies that he saves for later. And also has an apartment filled with cats. Then, Elisa notices Richard (Michael Shannon) and his secret government project he needs to hide in their facility which is a humanoid sea creature. Elisa becomes friends with the creature by feeding it eggs during her lunch breaks and notices the creature is not the threat they all assume. Richard trying to figure out what it is before the soviets try to steal their specimen away. Elisa helps breaks the creature free and falls for the creature. <br/><br/>What I like about the film is it does have a visionary tale. And del Toro always does it best. Every character is distinct and different. Sally Hawkins is a mute girl and sweet and charming with her performance. You can't help but to love her performance. Michael Shannon is addicted to painkillers and racist and becomes very nasty as the villain. A colonel that wants to get the job done by any means necessary. Richard Jenkins was good as a crazy cat man and obsessed with his key lime pie that tries to be friends with the waiter at a diner. Octavia Spencer is good as Elisa's friend. And Doug Jones as the amphibian man, if it was visual effects or practical make up work. It was well done. <br/><br/>The concept was neat as it plays in the 1960s. The time were the soviets was on the trail of trying to steal the americans amphibian creature. And also the fear of spies within the facility. <br/><br/>What I did not like about the film is the plot is slow moving. Which can be boring at times. Seeing Elisa go through her day-to-day routines can be repetitive and boring. Also, there is one weird musical scene that just took the tone and direction away from the movie. When Elisa and the Amphibian are on the dining room and she burst into an imaginary musical sequence was cheesy and weird. <br/><br/>Overall, The Shape of Water was a fair fantasy drama film."

"hnapel","6","4","17","4 March 2018"," Overrated movie with a bizarre plot.
","I will try to describe the bizarre plot of this overrated movie as scathing as possible so be prepared. A lonely woman that lives above a cinema and that cannot talk works as a cleaner in some secret government facility that oddly enough seems to be located in some city center. Her dull daily routine, that involves playing with herself (yes that kind of playing) in a bathtub each morning and boiling eggs is disturbed when a strange creature is wheeled into the facility in a big tank. While security at the facility is tight with myriads of cameras she manages to build a relationship with the amphibian. The beast does not exactly live up to modern CGI standards but is nevertheless passable. Some sadist at the site responsible for security likes to prod the aquatic humanoid with a cattle stick and this violence is duly met by Mr. Underwater with biting off a few of the man's digits and that ms. Mute finds when cleaning up the blood spill. Violence in this creature does not necessarily need to be provoked as we will soon learn when it bites off the head of an innocent cat. Apparently unaware that moviegoers are the same people that endlessly watch cat video's on YouTube this incident flied by the censors in the cutting room, maybe it shouldn't have. With the help of her neighbor, also quite lonely, she manages to free the scaled creature and hide it in her rooms that are located above the old fashioned cinema. Now the beast is in the bathtub and while it presumably has godlike powers of healing it struggles to breathe in that environment. Overlooking the fact that each cubic meter of water weighs a metric ton, the woman decides to submerge the bathroom so she can have a sexual encounter with the beast. We never see his thing, but Hollywood as usual can jump through hoops to explain that all away, shooting people dead with guns on the other hand as we can see later on is no problem, but a graphic depiction of the inception of life cannot be handled by the puritans, however admittedly at this time we would be breeding a chimera. The security guy in the mean time, under pressure from the military is scrambling to unravel the plot all the while struggling with the gangrene eating away at his reattached fingers. The only interesting dialog of the whole movie occurs when the army general explains to the guy how one failure can render a man useless despite any long standing record of accomplishments. For a silly moment I thought that all might end well if the creature could heal the man's fingers and in return he would let it escape in peace and all would be jolly, but no it had to end in violence with the man being killed by the creature that slashes his throat effortlessly. The mute woman, after also being hit disappears under water with the creature and that is the end of it and I would not worry what would happen to them just like the screenwriters that must also have been happy to conclude this plot open ended."
"justinwfirestone","6","4","17","24 January 2018"," Sappy and pointless
","Is enduring love impossible without having first learned how to yearn, pine, or miss? Is love more meaningful if it overcomes social pressure, personal villainy, and inter-species barriers?<br/><br/>Guillermo del Toro, with his partially steampunk, partially musical, partially fantasy adventure strongly suggests the answer is ""yes,"" to all of those questions.<br/><br/>Can a movie be partially many moods, many feels, many styles, and many genres, yet add up to a satisfying whole? I, with this review, strongly suggest the answer is ""no"" to that specific question.<br/><br/>For such a character-driven story, we surprisingly learn very little about any of the characters, except those slices of bits casually tossed around in order to add depth, none of which rise to the giving-a-damn level. One character used to have a drinking problem, another has a verbally combative marriage, and the ultimate reveal could possibly be when still yet another character shows a predilection for total silence while copulating. Oh, almost forgot: there's even one more character who absolutely loves soft-boiled eggs. Fascinating! Oopsie! Spoiler alert!<br/><br/>Water, water, everywhere, and all the drops do sink. Even the dancing lacks fluidity, and the stunning visuals lose their patina when that dark thought creeps into your head: this movie might be a lot more entertaining if everyone would die tragically and alone.<br/><br/>Of course, we cannot win Oscars thinking like that."

I really love when someone is honest and he isn't, obviously.

The movie is set in the 1960s, completely unnecessary and irrelevant to the them of a human falling in love with a merfolk.
Then they had to add all this stuff about the Soviets and the Americans hating each other, and of course the one guy had to be a Russian spy. It ruined the movie.<br/><br/>Movies often tell us a lot about the decade they come from. When you watch documentaries about the 1980s or the 1990s or whatever, the entertainment plays a big role.
I feel that in the future, the 2010s is going to be looked on as the decade of pasts.
Most of the movies and tv shows are remakes. And the ones that aren't are set in the past.
As for music, yeah, there's new music out there, but the radio stations still play 90% 80s music.
I feel cheated out of my 20s.<br/><br/>Also, while I didn't care much for this movie, I am highly annoyed with the Tumblrinas accusing this movie as ""triggering"" them with is horrendous violence and rape scenes. By today's standards, where many movies, tv shows, and books are just mindless killings, gun shots, and fighting, this movie was barely violent. And there was no rape in the movie.

","It is the early sixties and protagonist Elisa Esposito works as a cleaner in a secret government facility in Baltimore. We learn that as a baby she was found by a river bank with wounds to her neck that rendered her a lifelong mute, she can hear but speaks using sign language. One day a Colonel Strickland turns up at the facility with a creature he caught in the Amazon. It is humanoid but aquatic and apparently the native population believed it to be a god. It is believed that study of this creature could give America a lead in the ongoing space race. Strickland treats it cruelly and after it turns on him Eliza and her friend Zelda are told to clean the lab. After that she gradually befriends the creature. Then it is decided that the creature should be dissected... she decides to save it. In a subplot it emerges that one of the scientists is actually a Soviet spy; with orders to discover what he can but more importantly to prevent the Americans learning anything.<br/><br/>Those familiar with writer/director Guillermo del Toro's work, particularly 'Pan's Labyrinth' won't be surprised that this film is, at heart, a fairy tale. Like most fairy tales it is also a morality tale. Those from groups considered lesser; the disabled, Eliza; Blacks, Zelda; and homosexuals, Eliza's friend Giles are looked down on... and this ignored and unsuspected. Similarly all-American Col Strickland is clearly the villain of the piece; he may not look it but he is the real monster not the aquatic creature he captured. The story blends genres with elements from classic creature-features, spy thrillers and love stories seamlessly blended; we even get a fantasy song and dance number. The cast is great; most notably Sally Hawkins who gives a stellar performance as Eliza. Doug Jones also stands out even though he was hidden under creature make up and doesn't speak; it is all in the way he moves. The way the story is shot was great; we get a stylised version of the sixties where most things seem to be an unpleasant shade of green. There are some scenes that be bother some viewers with violence, nudity and some sex although none of these are too strong. Overall I'd say that while this won't be for everybody fans of del Toro should definitely give it a go."
"JMichaelAtchue","6","2","7","1 September 2019"," A Well-Intentioned But Trite Fantasy
","I'll admit to the fact that I went into ""The Shape of Water"" with a skeptical eye - to me it seemed like the kind of uninspired love story that easily wins over the Academy but doesn't actually have enough dramatic depth to be a good movie. After watching the film I'm glad it wasn't as bad as I excepted - but I'm disappointed that it wasn't particularly good either.<br/><br/>The movie follows the story of a mute janitor (Sally Hawkins) who works in an uptight government facility that houses a mysterious creature (Doug Jones). Both characters are outsiders who are treated with contempt by society. They fall in love but are soon persecuted by a ruthless Army colonel (Michael Shannon) who wants to kill the creature. It doesn't take long to realize that this story is something you've seen a thousand times in other (and better) movies: E.T., Edward Scissorhands, Beauty and the Beast, etc. A social outsider either becomes friends or falls in love with a monster who, in reality, is less of a monster than the society that hunts them. This type of story has been told so many times that nearly every plot point in ""The Shape of Water"" is easily predictable, making for an unsuspenseful and even uninteresting viewing experience.<br/><br/>Del Toro attempts to bring a fresh take on this familiar story by evoking B-movie nostalgia and making subtle references to the racism and sexism that's so often tolerated in our world. In fact ""The Shape of Water"" could be seen as an allegory for discrimination and prejudice - both as it happened in the 1960s and in the modern times. But Del Toro doesn't dive deeply enough into these themes, which are only infrequently hinted at throughout the film. I actually would've preferred for Del Toro to simply make a movie that explicitly dealt with discrimination and bigotry instead of dancing around those ideas in a metaphor.<br/><br/>Although the performances are stellar, every single major character is a one-dimensional archetype: the innocent social outcast, the monster with a heart of gold, the evil authority figure, the sarcastic best friend - all of these characters have been done plenty of times before and exist only as fantasy tropes, not as three dimensional people. The main cast is likeable, in particular Sally Hawkins, yet that doesn't make their stories original or engaging - which they aren't.<br/><br/>Del Toro is an imaginative filmmaker to be sure - the visuals of ""The Shape of Water"" are certainly bold and they do much to make up for a hollow script. Overall the movie is well paced - neither too slow or too fast and the score by the always inventive Alexander Desplat is whimsical and romantic. While ""The Shape of Water"" is aesthetically pleasing it's emotionally hollow and unoriginal. It has some good ideas that could've worked in a better script, and the acting is impressive, but it just didn't capture my attention as a viewer. 6/10."

It explores topics of love, ambition, authority, and abuse through a cold-war setting. It also is well-written with several fantastic plot twists and developments.

","After watching this movie, I couldn't resist myself from falling in love with Guillermo del Toro's direction and screenplay skills. I feel contrite about not knowing this man and his movies before this one. About the story, it weaves an unusual romance and thriller between a mute girl, Elisa Esposito (Sally Hawkins) and Amphibian Man, called the 'asset', a creature from the water. (Doug Jones) Elisa works as a cleaner at a secret government laboratory along with Zelda Delilah (Octavia Spencer), a co-worker and a friend who's also shown as her interpreter. Elisa lives next door to Giles. (Richard Jenkins) Giles is a struggling artist. Giles and Zelda are the only people Elisa has in her life. The movie is set in Baltimore, in '62. The story progresses as one day a creature, the asset is brought in the laboratory under the custody of Richard Strickland (Michael Shannon), a US Colonel who thinks of this creature as an affront to God. Dr. Hoffstetler (Michael Stuhlbarg) is considered in the laboratory to study this creature. He along with Zelda and Giles helps Elisa who has by now fallen in love with this creature, to take asset out from the laboratory as Strickland wants to vivisect this creature instead of giving time to the Dr. to study it. She keeps asset with her and decides to leave it in the canal when rains begin. A night before, Strickland knows about it and starts searching for Elisa. Zelda warns her about it and thus she runs away with asset near the canal and they both jump into the water while the narrator shows their perplexed happily ever after. About characters, Elisa was an overhanging character. One character that I can never forget. She is portrayed as a mute and an orphan girl. She finds herself incomplete. That's the reason she starts finding love in the asset when she looks at it for the first time. After that, she starts bringing him eggs and plays music for him. When she comes to know about Strickland trying to harm asset, she makes a plan with Giles to take it with her. She keeps it in the bath-tub and visits her often. Toro then shows their intimacy where the movie gears up. Giles, as a character is a resentful oldman, but a great friend and Elisa's confidant. The movie also has an element of humor, when Zelda talks about her husband or when Giles and Elisa watch TV in his appartment. Strickman, on the other hand is a very intense character and an arrogant Colonel. After Elisa, he is the second best character written. All the characters, no matter how minor, were well written and better executed. Toro's par excellence directing skills and Sally's acting that transcends beyond voice is something that makes this movie stand out of the usual Hollywood boxes. Doug Jones's glare aptly justifies the most striking dialogue of the movie- 'When he looks at me, he doesn't know I am incomplete. He sees me as I am.' Doug hadn't much to do than make sublime eye contacts which he did profusely well. The movie will surely bring back some memories of 'The Beauty and The Beast' and 'King Kong', but trust me, this movie is a lot more than what you think it is. You can watch all the Elisa-Asset scenes a trillion times and still fall in love with them again and again. This is the kind of movie that remains with you for the rest of your life. This movie is just magic and romance beyond all norms."

"cheetah-98624","10","2","7","3 May 2019"," The New Shape of Dark Romance
","The Shape of Water is a moving artwork that allows you to go back in time in a seemingly alternative time or period piece. This is one of those once in a generation films that will surely be labeled a classic for future generations. This allows you to feel what she feels as this love story develops. The motif of water and its hidden meaning is cleverly inserted throughout the superb cinematography of the film. It is not until the end of the film that you fully understand the title of The Shape of Water with a poem being read with a voice-over narration.<br/><br/>The Shape of Water clearly sets a new bar for romantic fantasy and redefines the complexity of human relationships. This story of unexpected love from what I would define as two misfits of a society that doesn't fully accept either of them. Elisa Esposito as Sally has a stunning performance as a mute that finds ways to communicate not only her words but feelings without speaking a single word throughout the film. She creates this character that you will fall in love with and find yourself rooting for her happiness throughout.<br/><br/>Richard Strickland, who plays the story's main villain, Michael Shannon, also plays his part in a way that you can respect how much you grow to despise his character. There are moments in the film that you get to take comfort in his pain and even give you a few laughs. He is gifted with being able to really compel you to root against him and what he stands for in the film.<br/><br/>As I was watching Shape of Water it took me back to another dark romance from years ago - Bram Stoker's Dracula. Both of the storylines are dark and consuming with a slower beginning to lead the story along, but the full thriller comes into fruition later in the film. The comparison between Winona Ryder's Mina and Elisa Esposito's Sally were comparable with their period wardrobe, dialect, and mannerisms. Mina has a friend, Lucy, played by Sadie Frost who acts as her confident while Sally does too with Zelda played by Octavia Spencer. Throughout both films you watch their relationships with each other and their romantic partners unfold.<br/><br/>Both films have a dark current that run throughout and a love interest that was challenging to understand. In addition, both Bram Stoker's Dracula and The Shape of Water are period pieces with Dracula set in 1462 and Shape of Water set in 1962. Both include a voice-over narrative by one of the characters. In Dracula, letters are continually being read aloud while the film plays on behind it for a large amount of the backstory of the film, but in The Shape of Water it is at the end that the poem is read aloud while the scene plays out. For me, there is a strong similarity and so, I say, if you like dark romances like Dracula, you will like The Shape of Water too."

","I prefer to go deeper than the mere political meaning (which could be ascribed to The Shape of Water, but is not necessarily inherent to it) and not see the amphibian man as a symbol of minorities.
Rather, I see it as this part of our own selves where our secret power dwells. It is with us from our birth, but we leave it become rudimentary and even see it as a flaw. We try to dissect it, harness it, make it serve purposes we imagine are good. What is it then? God, magic, an alien gene? Simply our wholeness, nothing else. Without which we will remain creatures who suffocate/drown in our natural environment.

","Guillermo Del Toro's The Shape of Water (2017) is a masterfully crafted piece of modern cinema. It's a good film.<br/><br/>The performances were great. Sally Hawkins and Richard Jenkins both delivered Oscar-worthy acting. Michael Shannon was understated, I think. Everyone else was good. Oh, side note: I thank god for Octavia Spencer.<br/><br/>The writing was... uneven. It exhibited some themes that were fascinating but not extremely well executed. Sometimes the writing was overly subtle and sometimes it was blatantly obvious. It was a good story which mostly made up for it.<br/><br/>The direction was incredible. With lighting, camera angles, performances, just about every piece of mise-en-scene, we're immersed in this world like a period piece. The way the scenes were executed was always perfect.<br/><br/>The rest of the filmmaking aspects were fine. I especially liked the production design (a pivotal part of the world that was created), the cinematography (every frame felt like a painting, quite striking), and the score (undoubtedly the 3rd best score of the year).<br/><br/>The Shape of Water (2017) isn't perfect. However, it is a good film with decent direction and great performances."

","In general, IMDb's ratings are pretty accurate due to its algorithms based on large amount of user input. However this one is very under rated due to fewer user input. Instead, the rating should consider the Critic's score in movies like this.<br/><br/>Unlike Hollywood big commercial products, this movie's main focus is Art and Romance. <br/><br/>In here, STORY is the key. A calming blue atmosphere sets the tone, slow paced but beautifully executed movement leads the plot, 60s time setting brings back vintage feel when America was great where certain character was main stream, psychological details deepens the emotions, open ending provides enough room for imagination and joy, logic chain is clear and strong. There's none unnecessary stuff in this movie, everything is just the right amount, like cooking. like art.<br/><br/>I have not seen such a great movie for a long time. It is not the ""Forrest Gump"" type of movie, but it deserves every single bit of OSCAR."

","Pans Labyrinth was a 10, and it edges this film, in my humble opinion. As with all of the director's films it really is stunning to look at.<br/><br/>I don't know if this has been said before but surely the film is about the fact (unless you're religious and believe in a God) that we all came from the sea? Fish people! The egg is a clue. <br/><br/>The Amphibian wasn't the monster, his tormentor, Strickland, was the monster. You have a disabled woman, a black woman, a gay man, all minorities. Sally Hawkins is unable to talk, just like the amphibian. They connect. Was she in fact an amphibian in the first place, having been found near the river as an orphan baby. She had gills. Back to the beginning.<br/><br/>The message at the end? Well, it looks like we might have to go back to the beginning as we really have messed up the world we have created, so best to start again.<br/><br/>Now, where's my egg."

The locations were so realistic that make you feel the world you are experiencing on the screen is really from the cold war period!
This film is not for every audience , some feel disgusted at some scenes.
The background score is absolutely appropriate for the movie!"
"BandSAboutMovies","8","2","7","9 June 2018"," A fantastic film
","His is a gorgeous film, with a well-considered look and feel. The color palette is gorgeous and makes sense, as Strickland fears the color teal and Eliza slowly gains more red color as the movie progresses.<br/><br/>There's also a bravura scene that recalls Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers in Follow the Fleet. It totally takes the movie into an even more fantastic world, if that is possible. It's my favorite part of a film that I found plenty to love in.<br/><br/>This still isn't my favorite del Toro movie (I love Crimson Peak so much), but it's still one of the better movies you'll see. You know who doesn't agree with me? Rex Reed. He called it ""a loopy, lunkheaded load of drivel"" and, referring to Hawkins, said that described people with disabilities were ""defective creatures"" and that her character was mentally handicapped. Oh yeah. And he also thought that Benicio del Toro directed it. I've hated Rex Reed's reviews since I was a kid and this doesn't change my mind at all. Perhaps we should remember his turn in Myra Breckinridge when considering his reviews."
"devo33","9","2","7","7 June 2018"," Bad reviews missed the point - watch it twice
","COULD HAVE SPOLIERS. This is an interesting storyline to say the least, but it is a technical beauty and I'm impressed for once that so many details are there without dumbing them down for the audience. Don't believe the bad reviews - these people missed the point. Whether it is a refrigerator full of half-eaten pies, or how you spell Mardi Gras - I urge you to pay attention to the small things and you will see how brilliant this storyline really is. <br/><br/>Color plays a huge part in this movie, especially green (including teal) and then red. Unlike ""The Sixth Sense"" - this is way more subtle and most people don't even notice. Another example - so many people upset that Strickland ""rapes"" his wife, but the point of putting his hand over her mouth and asking her not to say anything is because he was immediately obsessed with the mute Eliza. Instead of thinking about the scene and what it means, It seems to go over most viewers heads (at least the ones who write reviews). Understanding this is critical to understand the complicsted relationship Strickland has with the asset. <br/><br/>Watch it twice or more - you will see things you missed. This film is deep, and intelligent. Thank you Guillermo del Toro for not assuming we are too stupid to understand."

","Shape of water is the story of Elisa, a young mute woman, who works as a cleaning woman in some kind of laboratory. Elisa does not seem to be interested into the laboratory's activities until one certain day when she notices a strange creature in one of the room. She starts communicating with this watery creature and they end up having friendship bond. Notably because Elisa starting to feed the creature with boiled eggs. One day, when she notices that the creature is often beat and mistreated by the laboratory director, she decides to secretly make the creature escapes to her own apartment. From this point, she gets physically closer to the creature, who lives in her bathtub, and plans on releasing him in a canal near her place. However, the director of the laboratory is still looking for the creature and is ready to do everything to find it. Beyond the obvious suspense raised by the plot of this movie, we can easily appreciate the unusual environment and predicament of the action which hook the viewer due to their originality. Furthermore, Elisa and the creature being unable to speak and to communicate with words, a real stress on visual storytelling is done in this movie and is visible all along the action. In a nutshell, the very original plot and the construction of Shape of water lead us, as viewers, to be hooked by the action and that is why I would recommend you watch it!"

This is a must watch, and the 15 rating is an agreeable one as some erotic scenes are involved in this film. Other than that, a sublime film and a new favourite of mine."
"rj-27","6","2","7","4 January 2018"," The Shape of Del Toro's Mind
","I'll say this: Mr. Del Toro can make a cinematic experience memorable. I don't know any director who can craft a film in such an exquisite manner and at the same time inject revolting and mind numbing scenes of vulgarity and violence leaving you to ponder the point of it all.<br/><br/>In Pan's Labyrinth this combination worked to make a point about self sacrifice and mercy in an ugly world. Hellboy was strictly for entertainment and laughs. I enjoyed both, but for different reasons.<br/><br/>But in the Shape of Water, there is a different paradigm in play. While played ultimately as a fantasy, Del Toro makes it morally and ethically acceptable for a woman to express concern and mercy for another species by... mating with it? Perhaps the only reason this is remotely okay is because the creature is intelligent and has the ability to converse through sign language, and it has the shape of a humanoid. I do believe apes fit this description, too.<br/><br/>But, as I say, this is a fantasy and so it must play out as a weird and unusual love story. One where even a plain Jane mute with only a homosexual middle age man for a close friend can find herself as attractive, as long as it is with a fish-amphib- man.<br/><br/>The premise, as I make it out to be, falls more than a bit flat since you must not only suspend disbelief but your natural inclination to find only those of your own species as suitable mates. Asking us to do both at the same time in the name of what - tolerance, diversity? - is more than most can take.<br/><br/>So in this sense, Del Toro goes where no man has gone before and makes a beautifully crafted and repulsive movie wrapped in the same container. I'll give it a hesitant nod toward the positive only because the attempt at high mindedness is laudable, though regrettable in the manner of its execution on screen."

"dromasca","6","4","20","10 March 2018"," overrated, overrewarded
","From the beginning, maybe even before entering the cinema hall or starting digital viewing, the convention should be understood and accepted. 'The Shape of Water' is a fairy tale, even if it is apparently placed in a reality that has existed 50 or 60 years ago in a well-defined place with somewhat recognizable landmarks in North America. Even the science-fiction pretext is no more than a framework, although much of the action takes place in a science research center filled with fantastic machines with intimidating tubes, and control cabinets with flashes after the last the rage of electronics technologies in the middle of the last century. But it is a fairy tale that is not recommended to children, an adult R-rated fairytale.<br/><br/>Director Guillermo del Toro was born in Guadalajara, Mexico, in 1964. His cinematic feature includes 'The Devil's Backbone' (2001) during the Civil War in Spain, 'Pan's Labyrinth' (2006), considered to date his best film , and films from the success of Hollywood's ""Blade"" and ""Hellboy."" Two are the common features of his films, which we also find in the ""The Shape of Water"". The first is the presence of monsters in an universe that does not have the same aesthetic rules with our universe all the time, and where what we find to be physical deformation does not, according to ordinary conventions, equate to moral or character. Some of his films, including him most recent ones, have as main theme the meeting people and monsters, and the possible connection between them, a theme inherited from Gothic literature and traditional fairy tales such as ""The Beauty and the Beast"" taken over by folk culture in movies and musicals. The second feature is the predilection for different and disadvantaged characters. Elisa Esposito's main ""The Shape of Water"" heroine is mute, her friends and partners in the story are a gay painter and an African-American colleague working hard alongside Elisa as a cleaning woman in a government institution. Their opposite, government agent Rachard Strickland is white, rich, racist, and sadistic - all vices embodied in one person, who also has a seemingly exemplary family life and a predilection for expensive cars. A stereotype you would say, but in the end, it's just a negative character in a fairy tale, is not it?<br/><br/>The main theme of the film is the possibility of love between species. The 'monster' is brought into a sealed container, is prisoner and the subject of cruel medical experiments, with the shape of a reptilian nightmare, captured somewhere in the jungles and swamps of South America. The cognitive curiosity of the 'monster' is due to its ability to adapt to water and (for a certain period of time) and air. The two parallel respiratory systems could be useful to the Americans but also to their Soviet competitors engaged in the race to conquer the cosmos. This is the end of the scientific pretext of the film, and there is no need for more. Between the two possible approaches, the incompatibility of humans and other species developed in series of movies such as ""Alien"" started by Ridley Scott in 1979 and the possible friendship (and even more) with which ET ""Steven Spielberg responded in 1982, Guillermo del Toro clearly chooses the second option. He chooses and develops it because the connection between Elisa - fragile, weird, different in our world - and the monster who also likes hard-boiled eggs and jazz music evolves towards an impossible love affair with explicit erotic scenes, including a scene of inter-species sex with which spectators are aesthetically and emotionally tested.<br/><br/>Water plays an essential role in the visual universe created by Guillermo del Toro in this film. It represents the species barrier but also the environment in which the love story is consumed. It's a vehicle for comic sequences and the hero's rescue line. Cinematography and decors with their retro-quality and atmospheric atmosphere create a special aesthetic experience, from this point of view, ""The Shape of Water"" stands at the same level as films such as Martin Scorsese's ""Hugo"" or ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" by Wes Anderson . I add to this the special acting of Sally Hawkins, an English actress underestimated so far, perhaps because she is not a standard beauty, her physique being better suited for comic or compositional roles. Here, however, she's a perfect fit to a role that she performs with sensitivity and ingenuity, giving credibility to the fantastic relationship between the character of Elisa and the 'monster'.<br/><br/>'The Shape of Water' is not a masterpiece. Fairy tales, even those for adults, have their limits. The 'monster' is pretty schematic, and as convincing is Elisa's Sally Hawkins, so little believable seems her attraction to the representative of the amphibian species. Concentration of politically-incorrect vices in the negative character makes it a boxing sack hard to accept, even for a negative character in a fairy tale. The message 'We are new monsters' seems a little rhetorical. This film wining the supreme Academy Award tells more about the state of the industry than about the film itself. But did not we say the same thing in the previous few years?"

","One of the most beautiful movies ever made. Ostensibly a Cold War era science fiction monster movie set in 1960s Baltimore, it is, in actuality, an allegorical fairy tale aimed at exposing the puritanical, conservative Roy at the heart of America. The white Judeo-Christian alpha male, the hero of most movies, is the villain of the piece, intolerant of difference, domineering towards women, belittling of subordinates. The heroes are the woman with a disability, the woman of colour, the gay man, the foreigner and the (rather extreme example of the) outsider. The comparison between toxic masculinity and female sexuality is also presently beautifully.

I watched 3 billboards last night and was thoroughly entertained, if this thing gets anything other than art awards at the Oscars, it's a stitch up by the PC and art school brigade. It did show many clips from old movies, I wish I'd taken the hint and watched the Creature From The Black Lagoon instead."

","As one of the seemingly few people who didn't like Pan's Labyrinth, I was not surprised to find myself somewhat bored and unimpressed by The Shape of Water. The cinematography and sets felt overly stylized and the dialogue was incredibly corny for a Del Toro film. I always appreciate the attempt to create something majestic and ethereal in this manner, but this was a production that just missed the mark for me.<br/><br/>My biggest disappointment was in the creation of Fish-Man, who looked and moved like an am-dram student in a Kick-Ass costume. It was hard to engage with a love story when one of the participants is so farcically presented. I also found that the development of their relationship was unconvincing and incomplete.<br/><br/>I appreciate that there may be deeper symbolism and subtleties that I have missed but I believe that a film needs strong characters and an engaging plot above all else and on that count The Shape of Water simply lacks substance, ironic as that may be."

"eric262003","10","2","8","14 September 2019"," Del Toro At His Peak
","Set in the year 1962, ""The Shape of Water"" is about a mute lady named Elisa Esposito, who works as a cleaning lady at a top secret laboratory run by the government in Washington D.C. Feeling that her life will never change for the better, she along with her colleague Zelda Fuller (Octavia Spencer) find a horrendous looking amphibious humanoid held in captivity by the government authorities who want to dissect the creature, but Elisa begins to befriend the creature and makes it her mission to set it free.<br/><br/>Under the direction from Guillermo Del Toro, we see a rare fantasy story that's not set in mystical lands or some exaggerated place beyond our imagination, but set in our world just decades past. In a statement Del Toro said that this movie was one he felt very satisfied in making. Don't just take his words though, this movie received a plethora of awards including four Oscar wins.<br/><br/>The movie itself is the perfect combination of intriguing storytelling mixed with visuals that are vintage Del Toro and excellent performances by the ensemble cast. Plus we can't ignore the fact that everything that Del Toro does will likely be eccentric and enlightening.<br/><br/>Obviously inspired by classic monster movies and in this case, ""The Creature from the Black Lagoon"", from 1954, Del Toro had British actress Sally Hawkins in mind for the role as Eliza and Hawkins surely did not disappoint. Even though she plays a mute, she can still find ways to see the inner beauty of this creature who was subliminally brought to life by Doug Jones.<br/><br/>This film allows us to see some similarities between this and other fairy tales about princesses getting romantically linked with creatures that are not particularly human. Though Eliza is not blessed with royalty and the creature will not transform into a white knight on a steed. But Del Toro doesn't care about that he wants us to see how love should never be judged by its cover and that no matter how you look, love is for everyone.<br/><br/>Aside from Hawkins and Jones, they are joined by an eclectic diverse range of interesting characters both good an evil. We have Spencer who provides much needed comic relief as the only other friend of Eliza who acts as her sign language translator, and fellow cleaner, Zelda. We have Michael Stuhlbarg as Dimitri Mosenkov who's going incognito as Dr. Robert Hoffstetler who's a Russian spy secretly posing as a scientist to get enough information on the creature, and Elisa's other friend Giles (Richard Jenkins) her insecure neighbour who works as an advertising artist.<br/><br/>However, the real scene stealing performance comes from Michael Shannon as the tyrannical leader of this operation Col. Richard Strickland. His mission is to keep this creature in isolation and to make sure he's well disciplined. Even it means utilizing brutal ways like charging him with an electric cattle prod. Shannon takes great depth to make us despise this character that seems to take the pleasure to hurt the creature and fear those around him. What could have been a one dimensional villain character Del Toro who co-wrote the script with Vanessa Taylor gave Strickland a back story as to what caused him to be the way that he is.<br/><br/>The narration for ""The Shape of Water"" is backed up by Del Toro's colour choices and has an impressive soundtrack from Alexandre Desplat. The visuals are vibrant and stunning. Each scene has a similar visual vibe in some of his other films from the past like ""Crimson Tide"" or ""Pan's Labyrinth"".<br/><br/>The main colour for this flick is green which remains symbolic from Elisa's apparel to the key lime pie that Giles consumes, to the candy that Strickland eats, to the monster itself. In fact green is the omnipresent colour featured here, any other colours seems like an illusion.<br/><br/>A big shout out goes to the cinematography from Dan Laustsen, whose impressive visuals showed that this film was equal in both style and substance. It's these visuals complimented by this brilliant story that make this movie very magical and enticing.<br/><br/>Del Toro once spoke out to reporters that he was always curious about that real meaning of love. After seeing ""The Shape of Water"" and creating the right characters in the right atmosphere I firmly believe Del Toro answered his own question both stunningly and visually."

"cheetah-98624","10","2","8","3 May 2019"," The New Shape of Dark Romance
","The Shape of Water is a moving artwork that allows you to go back in time in a seemingly alternative time or period piece. This is one of those once in a generation films that will surely be labeled a classic for future generations. This allows you to feel what she feels as this love story develops. The motif of water and its hidden meaning is cleverly inserted throughout the superb cinematography of the film. It is not until the end of the film that you fully understand the title of The Shape of Water with a poem being read with a voice-over narration.<br/><br/>The Shape of Water clearly sets a new bar for romantic fantasy and redefines the complexity of human relationships. This story of unexpected love from what I would define as two misfits of a society that doesn't fully accept either of them. Elisa Esposito as Sally has a stunning performance as a mute that finds ways to communicate not only her words but feelings without speaking a single word throughout the film. She creates this character that you will fall in love with and find yourself rooting for her happiness throughout.
Richard Strickland, who plays the story's main villain, Michael Shannon, also plays his part in a way that you can respect how much you grow to despise his character. There are moments in the film that you get to take comfort in his pain and even give you a few laughs. He is gifted with being able to really compel you to root against him and what he stands for in the film.<br/><br/>As I was watching Shape of Water it took me back to another dark romance from years ago - Bram Stoker's Dracula. Both of the storylines are dark and consuming with a slower beginning to lead the story along, but the full thriller comes into fruition later in the film. The comparison between Winona Ryder's Mina and Elisa Esposito's Sally were comparable with their period wardrobe, dialect, and mannerisms. Mina has a friend, Lucy, played by Sadie Frost who acts as her confident while Sally does too with Zelda played by Octavia Spencer. Throughout both films you watch their relationships with each other and their romantic partners unfold.<br/><br/>Both films have a dark current that run throughout and a love interest that was challenging to understand. In addition, both Bram Stoker's Dracula and The Shape of Water are period pieces with Dracula set in 1462 and Shape of Water set in 1962. Both include a voice-over narrative by one of the characters. In Dracula, letters are continually being read aloud while the film plays on behind it for a large amount of the backstory of the film, but in The Shape of Water it is at the end that the poem is read aloud while the scene plays out. For me, there is a strong similarity and so, I say, if you like dark romances like Dracula, you will like The Shape of Water too."

"James_WRR","9","2","8","8 June 2018"," The Aquatic Erotic
","Originally posted on my movie blog: Buzz and Whirr (via Medium):<br/><br/>If I could kick things off rather poetically: The world of film is a vast sea. There are glittering surfaces and broad horizons galore, but also unseen depths full of monsters that rip the viewer away from comfort. Sometimes we find that the films we dive into are much deeper than expected, or shallow enough to break your neck on. Other films defy the logic of surface and depth altogether. Guillermo del Toro's filmography is built out of such movies, at once profound and delightfully shallow, always twisting and turning away from expectation.<br/><br/>The Shape of Water is the latest offering from the renowned Mexican director, one more monster-filled, heart-felt film for both the general public and the film buff alike. Written by Vanessa Taylor and del Toro (or Paul Zindel if you've read up on the controversy surrounding the movie), this is the typical story of woman meets fish.<br/><br/>The premise is simple yet bizarre and imaginative enough to warrant attention. Monster sex-appeal is quite the draw for crowds seeking innocent romance, fantastical effects and brave new frontiers all at the same time. ""The Aquatic Erotic"", with all its promises of smoothness, floating and dappled light is central to the movie. Almost every scene is as sensuous as the waves under which our two main characters float. The film's colours are subdued and cool. Even the shapes of the buildings and costumes are bulbous and flowing. The cinematographic poetry of the movie speaks the theme of waves and atomic energy ready to be unleashed. It is, truly, beautiful.<br/><br/>But under the slick, Deco surface of The Shape of Water is very human horror. The movie is surprisingly brutal. Gun shots pack a sonic punch and there is no lack of gore. Del Toro's well-known penchant for physical effects bring wounds to grizzly, vivid life, making the audience squirm and cry out in their seats.<br/><br/>The paranoid reality of the Cold War also plays out through carefully placed propaganda posters, military showmanship and all manner of subterfuge. It doesn't exactly feel like bombs are going to start flying at any moment, but there is definitely a tension in the air. For example, Michael Stuhlbarg plays the conflicted double-agent Dr. Hoffstetler. Torn between his desire to keep the monster alive and his duty to the Soviet government, he risks his life in the pursuit of true science.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the spectacularly scary Agent Strickland (Michael Shannon) does all in his power to vivisect the creature and move up the ranks. Under his stone-like exterior is a seething sadism. Shannon was the perfect casting for this role, what with his gobstopper-cracking jaw and piercing eyes. Dr. Hoffstetler and Agent Strickland play opposing forces, one fluid and caring, the other rigid and uncompromising. Both represent something bigger in the grand scheme of the Cold War, and both are grossly masculine.<br/><br/>Above the international politics though, The Shape of Water is a completely character driven story. The thread of doomed romance, unable to survive a bigoted and paranoid culture, that runs throughout the movie is powerful enough to completely overshadow even the origins of the creature. But, in the end, origins don't really matter. Beyond lip-service to pasts we never see we don't get much of a glimpse into anyone's past. All that exists is the present and, maybe, a future which hangs on a knife's edge.<br/><br/>The only thing to spoil such a perfect scene is an unnecessary reference to the creature's genitals. The physicality of the act may be part of del Toro's grand vision for a living, breathing, real monster, but its crudeness seems out of place. Though, if you consider the other angle, this sort of detail is what make the world of the movie unique. It's a well-balanced blend of realism and fantasy. That is, until...<br/><br/>... It falls awkwardly straight into the realm of fantasy in the final scenes.<br/><br/>The creature is referred to as having been worshipped as a god in its home country, but it is only well after the film's halfway point that its truly magical properties are revealed. Its power to heal wounds (and regrow hair) is a needlessly tacked on and clichÃ©d addition to an otherwise believable being. The creature seems to obey its own rules only as needed for the plot to progress. And when the finale comes and all is revealed, we are left unsatisfied by an un-killable monster that breaks the dramatic tension of the pursuit and romance.<br/><br/>The third act of the film is also far too compressed. After an hour and a half of world-building and character driven drama, the final chase and escape feels rushed and without the weight and reverence paid to the earlier scenes.<br/><br/>All in all, though, The Shape of Water will certainly last as one of Guillermo del Toro's masterpieces, alongside the unforgettable Pan's Labyrinth. The signature melding of reality and magic (aided, of course, by spectacular, tangible physical effects) elevates del Toro's movies out from the flood of big blockbuster flicks. It's going to be a long time before we get another film that makes the world fall for a movie monster."
"DeBBss","10","2","8","24 May 2018"," Good, But Not Picture Of The Year...
","As a huge fan of Guillermo del Toro and the Hellboy universe; I expected to love this movie, and I did. And yes, I did just claim that this movie is related to the Hellboy universe. I thought this movie was going to be a little more Sci-Fi/Fantasy than Drama/Romance. The idea was great; a little strange, but anything can happen in Hollywood nowadays. A lot of critics are praising this movie, and I can see why, but so much fame was put on this movie that some movies didn't get the spotlight it deserved. I think Edgar Wright should've got the Oscar for directing in Baby Driver, but it's just my opinion. I really couldn't find any problems in this movie; and I tried really hard to find just one issue. The pacing is good, the directing is good, the music was good, etc. Honestly The Shape of Water isn't really my cup of tea, but I can Respect it. <br/><br/>Story: 10/10<br/><br/>The story is unique and different, which is surprising; due to how long the movie business has been going. The idea that a woman falls in love with another creature can be a little strange, but the story was written so well that it kinda makes it normal; which is even more strange. The message of the story is kind of a cliche though; that you can fall in love with anyone or anything, and no one can stop you. This movie is 2 hours long and it's a Drama, so I expected to be bored, but I was always entertained. The storytelling and pacing always kept the movie on it's tracks, and it never leans to much into different subplots. Some of the subplots are great: Some are mysterious, some add to the story, and some make the characters more interesting. I liked how the story reveals itself more and more whenever Elisa finds out more and more. Overall, the story is interesting, the subplots are used perfectly, and the pacing leads to a great climax.<br/><br/>Characters: 10/10<br/><br/>In order for you to have a good Drama, you have to have good characters, and that's why this movie is a good Drama. The two main characters (Elisa and Amphibian Man) don't talk, so you have to make them likable, but use no dialogue. Elisa's relationship with Amphibian Man improves both characters, and makes them more ""likable"". The antagonist was done well. I enjoyed Michael Shannon's performance a lot, maybe a little too much. He makes his character so frightening and vulnerable at the same time, sometimes having a vulnerable antagonist can improve the character itself. The supporting cast was good too. No one really stood out, but they were likable, like Giles (Richard Jenkins) and Zelda (Octavia Spencer). Giles plays an important role in the story as Elisa's neighbor and best friend. Giles is a rather interesting character; being a struggling movie poster artist in a changing world. Zelda plays a role similar to Giles; she's Elisa's best friend too. Overall, the Main and supporting characters are well done, and the antagonist is easily hateable.<br/><br/>Action: 10/10<br/><br/>This movie has colorful settings in a rather dark world. The settings are so interesting and surprisingly colorful. The teal backdrop of this world adds flavour in this dull world. I could never get over how colorful this dark movie is. The direction and production design is out of this world. Some of the sets and scenes are just so interesting to look at, and I really have to respect the production designers. The music is great and eerie which represents the entire feel of the movie. The pacing is great and it really foreshadows the climax. Not much CGI is used, and sometimes in order to make a creature look real; you have to make it CGI, but the costume design was great and they really did make Amphibian Man look real. Overall, there was a lot of time spent on this movie, with great directing, production design, and costume design.<br/><br/>Overall, The shape of Water is a great drama. I could tell there was a lot of time spent on this movie, and it paid off. This movie is a 100% 10/10. There was no flaws whatsoever. The story was entertaining and unique, and it delivered a cliche message, but it delivered it greatly. The characters are amazing; they all played a part in this movie. All of the characters are likable, except for the villain, which is a good thing. The directing and production design is top notch. Although The Shape of Water really isn't my type of movie, I still have to respect it for doing such a great job. I strongly recommend The Shape of Water, it's a perfect Drama and a good Fantasy movie."

Absolutely, very stunning to the eye and wonderful effects that were not ""over done.""<br/><br/>Me personally, I am glad in a way Guillermo del Toro got best picture of this for selfish reasons. <br/><br/>Back in the early 2000s del Toro was very close in adapting HP Lovecraft's horror novel At The Mountains of Madness. As a Lovecraft fan, I was really stoked for this to happen. All the actors and crew were in place to put this on the big screen Unfortunately, the studio had an issue with his R rating and not budging on their request to lower it PG-13. The project was scrapped and remains in limbo.<br/><br/>How with two Oscars under his belt, I hope del Toro revisits this. I imagine the Hollywood won't be as quick to hinder the project now and this movie can get made."

","I am a huge fan of Pan's labyrinth and El Orfanato movies by Del Toro, both were breathtaking with full on melodramatic feelings with a mix of fantasy and horror, that always make you cry in the end.
From the grades this Shape of Water had in imdb, (and apparently there is a bunch of fake reviewers paid by someone lastly on imdb) I was expecting something close to the 2 previous movies, alas...
-The story itself is a huge ''deja vu'' of an alien/monster/ but good that is tracked down by the army and hidden by ''friends''. Taken by Spielberg is a great example.
-The Music: Well while it was perhaps the most affecting factor in the 2 Del Toro movies I mentioned before, that make you cry in the end, in this Shape of Water it's totally weird and non-sense, it's like if Del Toro gave the sound effects and music field of this movie to a 5 years old child!!
-Politics: slightly pro-communist just like in Pan's Labyrinth, you have the bad but also the good guy being communist, perhaps Del Toro forgot that USSR and other communist dictatorships killed millions of innocent civilians? No need to make then ''the good guys'' everytime.
-The end: pathetic! totally null.
Conclusion: if you loved Pan's Labyrinth and El Orfanato, please don't watch this movie, you will hate Del Toro."

","When I first saw this film, I thought it was going to be ordinary. I've seen ""The Creature from the Black Lagoon"" and other ""gill man"" movies, this one is a lot less horror. It takes place in the 60's dealing with every aspect of that time: segregation, time for change, and also top secret government information. Here you have two workers Elisa(Sally Hawkins) who is mute, and her coworker, Zelda(Octavia Spencer) who is African American and is her friend and interpreter. They both clean up at a government facility, which they are hiding something, ""Top Secret"". But other than that, there's a scientist who has happen to be a spy from Russia. Elisa secretly has spent time in the area where the creature is being held. She gives him a boiled egg, and teaches him sign language. The spy would rather help the creature than having it destroyed by his own countrymen goes beyond his way to save it. But he's not the only one. There's an ad illustrator(Richard Jenkins) who is friends with Elisa who would know about the creature as well. When Zelda and Elisa bring the creature from the facility, Elisa keeps him in the bathroom in the tub, and have plenty of salt ,because he is a marine creature. GIles(Jenkins) who owns lots of cats met him for the first time wasn't a pleasant one at first. He eats one of the cats, scratched his arm and ran off. But when he comes back to apologize in his own way, he pats his head and touches the arm he scratched. After seeing what happened, everyone comes to terms the creature is like a god.
After seeing the plot and results, I think that the movie is like a match made in heaven. The intimacy between the two beings is unbelievable. And that crazed Colonel is a very disturbing character. I don't care about the negative reviews from the other critics. Besides being 2 hours, it's worth every minute!
5 stars!"

","After winning Best Motion Picture of the year, against some pretty tough competition I just had to watch this movie and see what is it all about. I had a faint idea of what the story was going to represent. I knew already that it was about a woman falling in love with a sea creature (this isn't exactly spoilers) but I didn't know what to expect so I didn't have high expectations really. <br/><br/>The film was good, the story was ok. The cinematography was great. It is a beautiful movie and an even better love story. I can see it appealing to a variety of people, it is original and less cringe worthy than a lot of romantic movies nowadays. I can't really complain much about this film, I found it very enjoyable in fact and would recommend it to anyone. <br/><br/>Did it deserve Best Motion Picture of the Year? In my humble opinion: No, it did not. 
The fact that this movie was a feel good, cookie cutter of a film is exactly why it should not have won best motion picture. The story isn't revolutionary or controversial. I can think of a few other films that are more influential and have great substance to them. The Shape of Water is just a love story and that is it. 
I wish the academy would have picked another film, but I wasn't surprised that they picked this one out of the all the other once either."

","Guillermo del Toro is a real talent, but I think this movie asks a question that I was not that interested in: given that sexuality is an intensely personal kink, who would be turned on by the Creature from the Black Lagoon? And aren't the people who don't like the Creature from the Black Lagoon just horrid statists?<br/><br/>My interest in the various more popular forms of scifi have never extended to K/S or such. They never brought it up; therefore it didn't happen or was none of my business, and none of yours either. The dirtier, the better, and the less your business. And mine. Good fences make good neighbors, and so do drapes for the windows. And thick walls.<br/><br/>There are some fine images, and Del Toro has gotten some top-notch performers in to offer some wonderful performances, including Sally Hawkins, Michael Shannon, Richard Jenkins (a personal best performance) and Octavia Spencer. However, as is often the case with these visual stylists, the pacing becomes uneven in the middle. I get the impression the director is fighting with the editor and the pacing suffers."

The melodramatic preposterous storyline leaves a lot to be desired, though. The lead's starry-eyed, wistful portrayal was agonizing to bear in parts, actually, through the entire course of the film. Too bad the writer/director didn't explore the elements of racism in the flick. Why introduce it in bits and pieces if it was irrelevant in the first place?

Maybe it is because I am old enough to have seen ""The Creature From The Black Lagoon"" which seemed to be a partial inspiration for this film.

"KFilmmaker","Null","1","3","20 February 2018"," Masturbation in opening scene
","People who feel they are the odd balls in society should believe they have a voice and live like they matter. Watching all films which received Oscar nominations. Our groups was not happy this film started with a masturbation scene nor there were other masturbation scenes in the film. The sexual scenes whether from the boss having sex with his wife or Sally Hawkins masturbating does not add and is not even needed in the film, the only reason for it was probably a shock effect and it takes away from the film's value. This film is a love story about the creature from the black lagoon. Everything in the film was green from the uniforms of the lead actors to the building to the cars to the walls to the pie, jello etc. Green was the color of the film. Kudos to the production designers they did anamazing job. We knew the scars on Sally Hawkins neck would be useful for something in the end and indeed they were. I thought the creature was introduced too fast and awkward. The opening scene with the water and the quote by Richard Jenkins was great, but we really did not need to see the diner scene as it was obvious his character was homosexual so not real sure why they put the scene in. The second diner scene was just as weird and not relevelant to the film as the first because the audience already was aware of how white men in positions of authority treat people who are different than them. All you have to do is look at America today. I was impressed by Sally Hawkins and Octavia Spencer was just as funny and entertaining as always glad she was cast. I thought the director missed a unique opportunity when they were looking for the creature in regards to Sally Hawkins lunch bag full of eggs. I really liked the score. And thought some of the scenes were very far fetched and would have liked it to be more real, but that's just me. Overall I gave it 6 stars because of the sex scenes which did not add to the movie at all. And there was no real reason for the curse words either also took away from a brilliant movie. The ending for us and several other scenes was no surprise and wished it had been. Overall great film style, production design, score and great acting by all the characters including the creature. Take out the cursing, the sex scenes and we could rate it a 9. Great Love Story Remembering LOVE sees no color."
"FuggeddabouditFriendo","7","1","3","7 February 2018"," Decent, but not very original
","I'm not sure if I really liked this film all that much. There are certainly elements I enjoyed a lot, but there were also a lot of cheesy, stereotypical characters, which I really felt dragged the quality down a bit. The romance is very rushed. Honestly, the story of Michael Shannon's character finding and capturing the fishman seems like it would be more interesting than this story. I think the Shape of Water would have worked better as a mini series, as everything is just a bit too rushed in the film. It feels like a shortened version of the story. The story itself isn't exactly the most original, just because you have a human fall in love with a nonhuman doesn't mean the rest of the plot hasn't been done many times before. As for the visuals, they were pretty fantastic, the creature design and Doug Jones' performance are big pluses for me. Guillermo del Toro does a decent job directing, and I liked the overall look of the film, both owing a lot to the cinematography and editing. Sally Hawkins is pretty great, and Richard Jenkins nearly steals the film. Michael Shannon does a great job as usual, despite his character being something of a cliche. Michael Stuhlbarg is also really good. Octavia Spencer's character was the only one I didn't really like. I found her to be somewhat annoying. But that could just be me. Overall this film is well made, but the story itself happens too fast and is lacking a lot of originality. Still, I enjoyed enough of it to recommended it. 70\100<br/><br/>POTENTIAL SPOILERS IN THIS SECTION <br/><br/>My biggest complaints with the Shape of Water are the rushed pacing and somewhat unoriginal story. Well, I personally think this movie would have been better as a series. Maybe the first season is about Micheal Shannon searching for, and finding, the fishman, and bringing him to the city. Then the second can focus on Sally Hawkins and her building a relationship with the fishman. These two seasons could be fairly short. Then the third and final season could be longer, about planning and executing the escape, and basically the whole last act of the film. Maybe it's just me, I don't know, but I think that would have been better. It might also help with the unoriginality complaint if it's focued better on developing the characters and having more time to do so, so that's the overall story isn't so in-your-face. As it is, I just kept thinking it was basically Free Willy, except nobody had sex with the whale in Free Willy. Either way, I still liked the Shape of Water quite a bit, but I didn't love it like I wanted to. I certainly don't think it's Best Picture quality."
"trelerke-politics","6","1","3","30 January 2018"," Good-ish fantasy/drama period piece
","Not sure what all the buzz for this movie, seems maladroitly pieced together, some really good elements, the mute woman with obvious gills, Michael Shannon's acting, although a little too high dudgeon, still fun, the sets were great as was the high tech fish-man effects, a bit like Metropolis in that respect, as was the steam punk water tank set. But the movie didn't make sense, the fish-man was really more of a god than a strange creature that ultimately could not be killed, although the threat of it's death was a ""plot arc"" as if plot matters, it was mostly a love story involving alienated lovers, soulmates who finally meet. Somehow the director even undercut this, scenes seemed waterlogged/sodden even beyond all the water based sets. It wasn't really a bad movie, just not that good."
"anthonyf-22565","7","1","3","22 January 2018"," Overrated But Still Pretty Good
","Although there were some flaws, I felt this movie was unique in many ways. It captured the '60s feel gorgeously and had a sort of BioShock feel to it. What this film did was take a cliché theme (loving someone for who they truly are on the inside) and turn it into something fresh. By the end of the film, it means something much more than that, actually. The movie does a good job keeping you hooked in the beginning. Once the creature is rescued though, it slows down quite a bit, only to build up to a ending that seems lackluster given the message they're trying to convey. Beyond that, there are only a few things that bothered me during the film. Let me start off by saying I really enjoy Michael Shannon as an actor, I think he's one of the most underrated actors in the business right now. It's not that I have a huge problem with him in this film, it's just his character was a little too much of an archetype for me to really connect with. Also, some of his lines of dialogue are just corny. At the very end where he says he always pulls through and delivers or something like that was silly to me. Who actually says those things? It's just bad writing. And again, the whole scene where General Hoyt threatens him to retrieve the specimen is just cringe worthy to me. Other problems were just issues of logic, which honestly seems to be a big problem for GDT (seriously, just watch The Strain and you'll know what I'm talking about). When Elisa fills up the bathroom with water... there's no way in hell that could ever possibly happen, in that setting at least. I understand it's a movie involving an amphibian creature with superpowers but, we're still on Earth here. All in all, the movie was a good experience. It was a nice shake up in the romance genre and it really does have a deep meaning behind its cliché theme. I'd definitely recommend it to someone just looking for a really solid and enjoyable watch."
"benkitching13","7","1","3","16 January 2018"," Not disastrous, but failed to match the high expectation set.
","IMDB users appear incredibly divided over The Shape of Water, with many hailing it as a masterpiece and others dismissing it as a horrendously overrated piece of film making. I believe the film lies towards the former, but fails to reach it by a considerable margin.<br/><br/>As the lead role, you may expect Sally Hawkins to deliver the most accomplished performance in the film. However, that acclaim definitely lends itself more to Michael Shannon's ruthless and compelling depiction of ""patriotic"" agent Strickland, which I believe is unparalleled by another member of the cast. <br/><br/>Guillermo del Toro delivers some favourable, though not entirely innovative or exceptional cinematography and direction (including a moderately effective score). <br/><br/>The Shape of Water deserves praise for it's largely successful composite of comedic and serious, violent moments. <br/><br/>There aren't a tremendous number of overt flaws with The Shape of Water, it merely fails to deliver consistently high quality material."

"tscheltens","7","2","10","18 March 2018"," Good but best picture?
","So about The Shape Of Water,<br/><br/>Overall, I think it's a good film. Pretty cinematography, great blending of little bits of genres and an interesting concept, although... I think the overall story was a bit bland and too simple.
The relationship between the two main characters feels unrealistic, there is no motive for both of them to have sexual feelings, it kinda doesn't make sense. A friendship? sure, they are able to look beyond their ""flaws"" and connect like they can't with others, but does that give any logical reason for them to have sexual attraction? 
Furthermore, the villain feels over the top and more like a comic villain. He has no reason at all to be so evil and torture a humanoid. He just felt like a bland and simple bad guy to move the plot. Over acted as well.
The CGI was fine, nothing ground breaking, not sure if the creature was part practical, but it wasnt as realistic as I expected from the hype.
The main character, the girl, was acted pretty good. I bought her character and I empathized her. I only thought her arc was unrealistic (like a healthy person would have sex with another species, ever) and had no motivation (coming back to the motivation for the sexual connection, not the friendship one).
Coming back to the cinematography, this is where the movie shines. The colours and filters used are really amazing, typically Del Torro. Combined with the old, french/european 50-60s feels of the music and the cold war america setting, created a warm and rich environment. The camera work was good, nothing fancy or groundbreaking (think Dunkirk was the better choice). Same goes for lighting and shots, nothing fancy really but pretty.<br/><br/>Overall, good and enjoyable movie (more enjoyable then last years oscar winner, which should have been La La Land imo) but on a level of story and writing lacks the magic. <br/><br/>Tbh, I think this movie mainly won because it can appeal and satisfy a larger crowd then Dunkirk can, although I thought that was the better movie (even with the lack of leveled characters)."

","The Shape of Water opens with a whimsical, murky underwater scene in a submerged apartment, with fishes swimming around floating furniture as if in an aquarium. A character narrates about a ""fair prince's reign"" and a princess without a voice as we see a woman floating above her sofa in a sleeping pose; drowned passively and unaware while catching some Z's.<br/><br/>Sirens scream outside Elisa's window and she draws a bath. She makes a high cholesterol lunch of three boiled eggs (probably not a great plan...) and sets an egg timer in the bathroom, noting several long (and meticulously placed) scars on her throat in the mirror - she then pleasures herself in the bath. It's healthy and natural and normal and it's delightfully embarrassing.<br/><br/>At her neighbor, Giles' place we learn Elisa's mute and the scars on her neck seem to make sense now. Giles notes the smell of cocoa in the air from a fire at the chocolate factory: ""tragedy and delight, hand in hand"". Alone in the hall on the way out, Elisa does a whimsical little tap dance in her particularly highly polished black shoes, like Shirley Temple on TV. She has a unique exuberance and she seems to be in another world; she must be a woman of wonderment.<br/><br/>Elisa works as a custodian at a government facility with Zelda, her talkative coworker. As they're cleaning in a dank room with a water tank a ""sensitive asset"" is brought in; a sea creature in a pressure tank. Elisa approaches the tank and taps gently on the glass and the creature inside bashes the windows. They're rushed out.<br/><br/>Back at Giles' place, the key lime pie he bought is sordid and turns Elisa's tongue green. She should probably just spit that cloying green fakeness out.<br/><br/>At work they're cleaning the men's room when security man, Strickland enters the room with a bloodied truncheon. He pisses in front of them at the urinal while rendering a full description of the cherished cattle-prod, specifically refusing to wash his hands afterward. He is very meticulously offensive. Later, he's seen in the hall bleeding profusely from his hand. They're called in to clean a bloody mess in the fish room where Elisa finds two of his fingers, bitten off. Ich.<br/><br/>At the advertising firm where he works on Contingency basis as an illustrator, Giles is advised that the Happy Family piece he's presenting will have to change. The Jell-O will have to be green; green is the future now - it's a new concept.<br/><br/>Elisa decides to have lunch with the creature. She enters the tank room alone, sits at the edge of the open aquarium and offers a hardboiled egg. The fish thing emerges from the water imposingly, makes gurgly noises, and then postures super-aggressively when she makes a quick movement. She backs down and lays the egg on the ledge, calling it ""egg"" in sign language. The creature makes noises, snatches the egg, and dives back into the water.<br/><br/>Strickland is a pressure tank filled with prejudice and self-loathing. He has a lousy relationship with his family and detests being home. After the kids go off to school he washes his hands as required by his wife, she sniffs his hand to confirm cleanliness and then unbuttons her dress and hauls her breast out, putting his hand on it. During sex he strokes her face dumbly with his wounded hand (with sewn-on fingers), then when she protests that his hand is bleeding on her he puts his bleeding hand over her mouth, saying ""Don't talk... Silence"" It's all very meticulously offensive.<br/><br/>Entertainment is a must on a second date, so Elisa brings a record player into the tank room to play music while they dine. As a record plays, she signs ""music"". It signs ""music"" back. They have a certain simpatico. Like the whirlwind rush of new love it's suddenly a thing now. We see Elisa daydreaming romantically, bringing more records into the tank room, and performing a delightful dance for It while mopping. It's every bit as charming as the old B&W musicals. Only, green.<br/><br/>A blind spot can be created, and Elisa makes another great plan as she smokes a cigarette, eyeing the upturned camera at the loading dock.<br/><br/>We feel bad for the fish thing when we see Strickland pointlessly abusing It. He must be bad. He wants to vivisect It of course, but a scientist (who's also a Russian spy) wants to study It and seems to feel for It. Elisa tries to enlist Giles' help to get It out of the facility. She says It accepts her as she is; It doesn't know how she is ""incomplete"". We feel bad for her; she must be a woman of wounds. Giles ultimately agrees to help get the creature out of the facility because Elisa ""needs"" It.<br/><br/>Strickland is stalking Elisa now. He methodically creates a small water spill and has Elisa brought into the office to clean it. He makes his objective clear with a heavy dose of sexual harassment, saying she's not much to look at but he likes her scars and the fact that she can't speak; it gets him going. He seems genuine. She runs out as he says ""I bet I could make you squawk a little"". He is very sincerely offensive.<br/><br/>Strickland's reading (and distorting) ""The Power of Positive Thinking"". This seems to show how manipulative Strickland is, but it doesn't, really.<br/><br/>As Elisa executes her amphibian extraction mission she gets some unexpected help from the Russian scientist and Zelda (who first rightly implies that she's out of her mind). Per the scientist's advisement, the fish thing apparently eats raw meat. Ich.<br/><br/>After the escape, Elisa and Giles put the fish thing in her bathtub (she'd better scrub that down with bleach after they figure out what to do with It...). The next day, Elisa and Zelda go to work where they'll have to act like Normal and Giles chats with the creature in a charming one-sided heart-to-heart talk. Then the creature gruesomely savages one of the cats in a bloody spectacle of heinous barbarity and gashes Giles' forearm as It escapes. But that's OK because It's a wild animal after all...<br/><br/>Strickland calls Elisa and Zelda into his office to interrogate and insult them and Elisa signs ""F- you"". He can't tell what she said but we're proud of her for standing up to him anyway. She must be a woman of will. She later overlooks the savaged cat and desperately searches for her 'needed' creature, finding It in the cinema by following a trail left by Its bloodied claw-flippers. They experience a touching connection. Back home, the creature has a contradictory change of character, behaving like a pet now. It lays low, sliming Giles charmingly in an oopsy-doopsy, flippy-floppy 'lets-make-up' session. Well, it must be water under the bridge after all that sloppy green 'cuteness'.<br/><br/>So then Elisa decides to have SEX with the creature - she disrobes and steps into the bathtub with It. But that's OK because she does this kind of activity in the bath all the time after all... It's healthy and natural and normal and it's delightfully embarrassing.<br/><br/>The next morning Elisa daydreams whimsically on the bus. It's so very romantic and she's so delightfully vivacious now; she's even wearing a pair of sexy red pumps. When Zelda wonders how it happened (meaning how it was even possible) (as opposed to why would anyone ever...) Elisa super-cutely explains that It has a sheath that retracts to reveal... well, you know... The creature is apparently exceptionally 'complete'.<br/><br/>Elisa whimsically creates a huge soggy mess, flooding the bathroom with water so she can have a touching naked connection with the creature, submerged. Water runs down into the cinema and the apartment is flooded when Giles opens the bathroom door, but that's OK because it's delightful and it probably just won't cause water damage and black rot in the walls. Anything is impossible in the movies...<br/><br/>The fish thing can just suddenly heal wounds as if by magic, so It heals Giles' arm but strangely doesn't bring their savaged cat back from the dead. Sadly, It starts having a problem, though. It doesn't seem like Ich, but Its scales are sloughing off in a slimy way. It's apparently going off, but they don't seem to notice the smell... They'd better wash their hands after handling It...<br/><br/>Elisa bothers to place buckets under water leaks from the rain and the creature sits at the table proper, preparing to eat boiled eggs. It makes noises and signs ""egg"". Elisa nods. They have a certain simpatico. She starts signing some other words but It's inattentive and doesn't understand. She then has a delightful fantasy in B&W that she's singing and dancing with It onstage like in an old musical. Its gills vent in time to the music.<br/><br/>The Russian scientist is shot by his comrades, who Strickland then shoots down so he can torture the scientist. He drags him by the bloody gunshot hole in his cheek, tazes him with the electric cattle prod, and grips him brutally by the gunshot wound in his gut. The scientist has no information; it's a gory torture session made 'necessary' by how very bad Strickland must be.<br/><br/>Elisa and Giles take the creature to the docks to release It into the sea. Strickland catches up with them, clocks Giles, and shoots the creature and Elisa. The creature then imposingly rises to Its feet and simply just wipes Its gunshot wounds away because It can just do that. Strickland says ""F-... You are a god"" and It does the 'godlike' thing and slashes his throat with Its claws.<br/><br/>The ""fair prince"" then jumps into the water with Elisa (who is dead) and 'magically' transforms her with a kiss, ending the curse that had made her a lowly human. The scars on her neck become (meticulously placed) gills and she starts to breathe like a fish underwater. Apparently undeserving of a good relationship with one of her own kind and fated otherwise to a premature death, she is 'completed' now by the unbelievable transformation of abuse injuries into a survival mechanism, joined dependently to her 'needed' creature, and prepared in this way for her 'deliverance' into Its domain: a cold, inhuman world of water."

Yes, it was good in its execution, but I do not see the distinguishing factor that earned this film 13 Oscar nominations and 4 wins, including Best Picture and Best Director. <br/><br/>For me, this was just an above average film, somewhat engaging and entertaining, but nothing truly innovative or thought-provoking. I promptly forgot about the film about 10 minutes after viewing it. I saw it just yesterday, but I can't remember any of the characters' names. I felt no strong emotional attachment to any of them, and I wasn't gripping the edge of my seat to find out what will happen to them either.

It all looked so amazingly realistic and that was pure art to watch on the screen.<br/><br/>I feel that the full potential at what this movie had to offer wasn't fully utilized, and that was a shame, because the movie really could have been so much more if it had been given the chance to flourish.<br/><br/>For me, this is the type of movie that you watch once and never return to a second time around."

"wilfredlucas","7","1","4","5 March 2018"," Best Picture winner is enchanting and spellbinding, yet too morally uncomplicated
","'The Shape of Water' is an amazing, spellbinding romantic fairy tale, an empowering story of marginalized groups, and a crowd-pleasing tribute to the magic of cinema. Yet it fails to build up a compelling final act, and misses covering up plot holes, familiarity and lack of moral complexity.<br/><br/>Guillermo del Toro showcased his signature charm of combining spectacle, emotion, oddity and violence in the multi-Oscar-nominated film. The distinctive coloring and high contrast emphasized the masterful production design apt with the 1962 Cold War setting. Alexandre Desplat composed such a memorable piece of music, mixing the magic he made from his previous Harry Potter scores with French instrumentation.<br/><br/>Sally Hawkins as the mute Elisa was the overwhelming standout performance in the film. The way she can induce so much emotion even without a voice is such a marvel, and the scene where she was confronting Giles is just that kind of acting that will stick to you for a long time. Majority of the cast also provided well-rounded support, particularly Richard Jenkins as Giles, Octavia Spencer as Zelda, Michael Shannon as Colonel Strickland, and Michael Stuhlbarg as Dimitri. Other highlights included the vintage cinema scene, the egg sequences, the tearjerker black-and-white dance sequence reminiscent of 'La La Land,' and the amusing and elegantly-depicted love scenes between Elisa and the Amphibian Man. The nonverbal chemistry between the two leads helped the film divert from clichÃ©d romantic films and emphasize the profoundness of love. In this movie, the silence of love, even if you can't hear it, thundered through the viewers' heart. And although the film was a poignant love story in core, it also proved to be politically relevant, as portrayed in the representation of homosexuals, Black Americans, and the disabled in 1960s America.<br/><br/>The film, no matter how visually pitch-perfect, has its elements that might leave some audiences dissatisfied. Nick Searcy as General Hoyt gave a mediocre performance. Probably my biggest problem with the film are the questionable plot holes, the seeming familiarity of the plot, and the unsatisfying hollowness of the climax and ending. Del Toro chose to depict such small and clumsy final battle sequences. The plot was also very comparable to del Toro's most acclaimed work, 'Pan's Labyrinth,' which also had the same ending and a one-sided antagonist with no explained reason to be evil whatsoever. Del Toro had this polarization between good and evil in both films, which might be a too safe and unchallenging illustration of humanity and morality.<br/><br/>With its overwhelming Oscar win, 'The Shape of Water' is obviously the film which caters to the general appeal. It's poignantly enchanting, and it deserved the response it from The Academy."

","The acting is superb, the direction and visuals are great and the storyline is as mysterious as it is compelling and beautiful to watch. The beginning is great and the ending is great.

I mean, why did they have to fill this time? 
Sadly, it took me out of the movie, because everything else was great. Therefore I would call The Shape Of Water a good movie, but not something that deserves 13 oscars or so: 7/10"

"andrewhuk","7","1","5","17 May 2020"," Not Del Toro's best by any means, but solid.
","Guillermo Del Toro is one of a handful of truly visionary directors left and his work always manages to push boundaries and astonish audiences. The Shape of Water is a different kind of movie for Del Toro. Perhaps his most stylised work to date (the 1940's setting really sparkles, but I couldn't help comparing it to the visual style of Amelie, which was distracting, particularly with Sally Hawkins having a passing resemblance to Audrey Tautou and the musical cues being very close as well. It certainly has a very European feel about it, which is perhaps at odds with the content and setting of the film.<br/><br/>That aside, everything moves along at a fast pace and the action comes thick and fast. Performances are all solid, and it's engaging enough.<br/><br/>For me though, it didn't quite have the substance of Del Toros best work, which was a shame. I am incredibly pleased to see the film being such a success critically and commercially, and by most other directors standards the film is indeed a resounding success, but Del Toro isn't anyone, and for my money he can, and will, do better work in the future."

The photography and music composed by Alexandre Desplat manage to create an underwater experience that pays homage to classic cinema and also manages to captivate and identify with each of the characters. The shape of the water is without a doubt a beautiful movie in all its aspects and that manages to impact us with its highly detailed aesthetics and majestic direction.

","The film is about a mute woman who works in a secret Government institution. One day she discovers that they are hiding a creature which looks like a mermaid and she helps it to escape the installations and start a new life. Actually the film was really strange for what I have to say, but there are some good points that I want to comment.<br/><br/>First of all, I do not think that the film is relatable at all because the story is really disturbing and strange. I do not mean that supernatural stories are not relatable, but this in particular had a strange feeling and made me think all the time that what I was watching was disturbing, and I felt awkward at some points. Also, there were some comments and scenes which I think they did not have to show. For example, in the one where the main character explains how the mermaid can have sex, I think that is a really inappropriate comment.<br/><br/>However, I think that the film is good because the story is very well built. It makes you think and ask yourself questions of what is going on, using elements that appear at the beginning and come again almost at the end of the film when you already forgot them and which solve a lot of questions. Also, the suspense during all the film was good although it was not as tense as I expected from a film of this director.

","Saw this film as a rare in-theater experience, with my 15 year old boys. They both gave it enthusiastic two fingers, errr thumbs, up. It is a love story, albeit one as you know from the poster with a creature from Del Toro's subconscious.<br/><br/>The film floats fairly smoothly, and perhaps for that reason I found myself drifting towards Michael Shannon's character. And yet they pile villainous vices upon him a tad too much for my taste. A befuddled Richard Jenkins adds sweetness beyond a piece of pie or three.<br/><br/>It's easy enough to lie back and enjoy the clever creativity of Del Toro, and the soundtrack is a nice blend of incidental music with songs from a simpler era (with more intricate dance steps.) Will Ms. Hawkins be another Oscar award winner rewarded for being female and mute (isn't that some kind of weird Hollywood tacit thing).<br/><br/>For what it's worth, I would have been fine seeing this on a small screen, although it was nice for the boys to enjoy it in proper fashion (and as a break during their finals week to boot!). By the way it is a R-rated film, with a couple of sex scenes...which is not a huge deal....but one of them has somewhat of a violent edge to it, and it is NOT one of the interspecies scenes. Anyways, something for parents though I suspect I'm not alone in feeling like 15 years olds can vary from feeling like 12 to 18 year olds. By the way we talked about it afterwards and they felt it was not a big deal.<br/><br/>As for the film overall, again gorgeous and such a tremendous opening scene, the trailer we had all seen long ago maybe set my sights a little too high, but on my own amphibious DNA I swear Blade Runner 2049 is a far richer picture."

","It was a Guillermo del Toro picture so of course it looked great. A darkly lit and textured movie that made the plastic of the 1950's/60's look organic. The acting was great and the sound very good. The only problem with this movie was that I saw it already. I saw it in 1982 when my parents took me to see E.T. and again in 1984 when I saw Splash with Tom Hanks. I know the story of the movie five minutes in. Big evil scary Army/Government gets their hands on a creature different than us humans. The mistreat it and torture it and of course this makes the creature unresponsive, angry, and sad. Then a childlike, loner (I mean lonely. Ever notice how people who are alone, mad, and crazy are loners and people who are alone but nice, gentle, and friendly are simply just... alone?) loner comes along who can connect with the creature, forms a bond, and then helps said creature. Like I said, a good movie but one I've seen before. 
It's hard to perform without speaking and Sally Hawkins pulls it off nicely. Her face was full of expression and I like the way the subtitles during her sign language were handled. Richard Jenkins was like the breath you take after being under water to long. He was funny and human instead of being the stereotypical ""villain or hero or sidekick"". I thought he was the best part. Everyone acted well but they were all stereotypical. Not the fault of the actors but rather the fault of the writer.
A good movie and if you have two hours to kill go ahead and watch it. You may like it a lot. After all it's nominated for an Oscar. However, like I said, it's derivative and therefore predictable."

BEASTIALITY is basically where i lost this movie and if anyone can justify a woman having sex with a fish like man (that oddly resembles abe from his Hellboy movies) then your just as perverse. This is no love story to me, it's gross. It starts off all well as these two women, the mute Elisa (Sally Hawkins) and her best friend Zelda the charismatic (Octavia Spencer) work in a HIGH SECURITY (remember that) secret lab set in the 60S cold war era, cue the villainous agent (Michael Shannon) whose brought a secret creature into the facility to torture it and be cruel for reasons we don't know. Basically this mute Elisa who gets herself off vigorously every morning in the bathtub starts sneaking around this facility with the help of her reluctant friend Zelda and starts bringing the Creature eggs and wouldn't you know it......they fall in love. Now she comes up with an escape plan involving her neighbour (Richard Jenkins) and Zelda to sneak this creature out. Now if you thought sneaking around a high security facility was hard, your wrong, these two nobodies and their friend manage to escape with the help of a russian whose motives remain a mystery to me like this movie. THAT'S RIGHT TWO NOBODIES ESCAPED A HIGH SECURITY LAB. They escape then the creature eats a cats head then escapes apartment ending up in a cinema which baffles me as no one notices a 6ft tall lizard fish walking around 60s america. Elisa takes creature home and fills her apartment bathroom with water and boom, they get it on. YUKKK ! Creature gets let free in a scene that's prob best of the movie and WHAT ?? He's a FISH GOD or something......bottom line this could've been good but gets let down by lackluster story and no real meaning of anything even in a fantasy world you would scratch your head and say what is this garbage. Go watch for yourself but i didn't agree with it or like it."

","To be honest if you are old enough to have seen Splash (with Darryl Hannah) then you dont need to see this . It's basically the same story with a few left wing add on's thrown in so it can be considered for an Oscar (e.g the side story of racist bad guy ) and for good measure a nonsense side story about a homosexual man which again was thrown in purely as a nod towards Oscar nomination.
However great special effects and some decent acting made it watchable but this should be a long way from Oscar nomination material."

The storyline could have been so promising, but for whatever reason, it got taken down a very strange path and I have no idea why!?<br/><br/>I found myself wondering if the actors themselves were embarrassed at how ridiculous the storyline became, having to act out scenes which were just so odd - a fish man being able to do sign language straight off the bat, or the fact they have sex together. Or even that they would fill the bathroom with water with no thought to the consequences? Just so many silly scenes which drove me to fast forward the last 3rd of the film.<br/><br/>Such a shame because it really did have potential. I would say don't waste your time - I wish I hadn't."

","This is very much an arthouse film. For you young guns out there, all I mean by that is that this movie will be appreciated more by cinephiles. It has enough plot structure to be enjoyed above the surface, but it's really looking for the focused to dive into the deep end to find the subtleties and metaphors about. I don't find this to be a masterpiece of storytelling, but let's simply look at its elements by themselves.<br/><br/><br/><br/> The story builds up Sally Hawkins' deaf character's mundane routine as a janitor at a research facility for about the first 20 minutes. Although del Toro's directing is at its most prominent, it also could've been shortened down a bit-especially when you consider the story that still has to be told. Also, to backtrack a bit, the very opening sequence is absolutely phenomenal-but anyways. Soon, a mysterious creature led by the always-evil Michael Shannon is transported to the facility for some testing. While everyone views it as a monster that has to be taken care of in some way or another, Hawkins starts to see the other side to the amphibious creature. I don't think they ever specify what it is, but for all intents and purposes, let's call it a merman. To avoid spoilers the plot follows this thread for a little over halfway, then it switches over to a different type of plot to finish the film out. Basically, it switches the main objectives of what needs to be done, and with the time it takes to properly develop each of these story elements, some of the added stuff I feel should've been cut down more: namely, the opening montage and actually getting to the reveal of the creature, and eating some lovely nasty pie at the shop (but I'm sure Richard Jenkins needed the boosted screen time to put him contention for a best supporting actor nod).<br/><br/><br/><br/> Speaking of Jenkins, the characters are mostly good. Jenkins fills his role admirably, Hawkins is obviously amazing, Shannon is just playing the role he always plays, and Octavia Spencer turns in a great supporting role as Hawkins' janitor friend. But with the exception of Hawkins, everyone is still second fiddle so that the merman can shine. The characters are all interesting and all developed, but they fill the necessary gap and not too much more. And in the hands of Pan's Labyrinth (and Pacific Rim, but that doesn't help the guy here) del Toro (who also wrote), the fantastical mythicalness of the merman shines through. It's really quite a spectacle that fits perfectly within his realm

"TheOmnislash","5","1","6","10 June 2018"," Is Del Toro actually a spectacular director?
","Director Guillermo Del Toro's skills and excellent filming techniques have been frequently questioned by many after releasing his two last films: Pacific Rim and Crimson Peak. Del Toro has always been a quite controversial director due to his unique style, however, it is agreed that his best film was The Pan's Labyrinth which caught attention and has an impact on some other directors. The question is whether he is able to make such masterpieces like Pan's Labyrinth or whether he is just an average director who had one spectacularly great film. His new film, The Shape of Water has definitely answered the question although this opinion probably won't be popular or widely held.<br/><br/>The Shape of Water was released in 2017 and got four Oscars including the Best motion picture of the year and the best achievement in directing. These awards may suggest that Del Toro's new film is spotless, in fact, the Academy Awards has lately become rather a show which tries to be as politically correct as possible than awarding actually great and splendid works such as mother!, Phantom Thread or Dunkirk. <br/><br/>The film takes place in the early 50's, 60's in the USA during the Cold War era. Sally Hawkins (Elisa Esposito) is a deaf and shy woman who works at a research facility as a janitor when a strange sea creature is captured and is held as a prisoner in this facility. Sally falls in love with this creature because they are both suffering from discrimination and she decides to rescue him.<br/><br/>Del Toro's most powerful tool in order to make his films astonishing is the colorful and unique world he creates. The costumes and the scenery are prominently beautiful and thus the whole atmosphere is just amazing and is on point. Visually and cinematographically The Shape of Water is immaculate and the music score and the soundtracks are also mentionable elements. On the other hand the film has some terrible mistakes and aspects that made me become disenchanted with the directing of Del Toro since I had high expectations due to the eleven Oscar nominations and my admiration towards the director. The film is full of poor dialogues and inappropriate scenes especially the ones that try to make the film more naturalistic and sincere but only making it unnecessary and unpleasant. I've lost count the number of times how many clichés were in the film moreover the whole point of the film is just a boring and frequently discussed cliché: only inner beauty can generate true love. The problem is not with the message itself but the way the film tries to depict it. It is clear that Del Toro wanted to make sure everybody understands and embraces the essence of his film for the very meaning of The Shape of Water was said by Sally in the film world by world. Del Toro doesn't even want to make people think he wants to make sure everybody can understand this simple piece of wisdom. There is no need for interpretations or deeper thoughts the goal was unambiguously to win the desired Oscar award by being politically correct and to express an extremely simple message. This is the mockery of the art of motion picture. One of the characters is depicted as homosexual although it isn't dramaturgically reasonable since there is nothing to do with his sexuality. Almost every single male character is either a bad person or a weak one. These are the most important elements that show the impact of feminism and ultra liberalism on the film industry. Politics should not affect art or sports and that is the reason why I completely dislike Del Toro's film. <br/><br/>In light of the above, the answer to the question is that Guillermo Del Toro may have some nice ideas and has a great fantasy; however, he is not an incredibly memorable or fantastic director after all. The Shape of Water is not worth watching although visually it is pretty well-done."
"antogilio","Null","1","6","2 June 2018"," Not so good
","When I went to see the movie, I was really enthusiatic and happy, but unfortunately when I went out from the sale I was litterally disappointed. The movie is so damn fascinating because of scenography, photography and soundtrack. Elisa (Sally Hawkings) is a very well-written character and also Micheal Shannon's one. The thing that really made me sad of the movie was the fact that we can't see the development of the love between Elisa and the ''god''. It seems like something is missing in the screenplay, that beside this is very sophisticated. All in all, the movie is no bad but honestly it did't deserve the oscar for the best picture (that should have been won by call me by your name)."

","The movie was good and engaging. Visually the creature was good for the most part, his postures and the fingers did look awkward though. My biggest problem was that the events were not convincing; let's say a character changing his mind in the middle of the movie and you are surprised like really?! How? You can't help but feeling that some parts of the story was patched together poorly.
The main character gives a great performance, and the music was good too.
Overall it's a good movie, but not worthy of the best picture."

","When a movie gets that much praise some may find it difficult to watch this without any prejudice. So you may have certain expectations that might be higher than would be good for the movie. Then again, the movie can hold the pressure if you let yourself into that fairy tale. Because this is what this is, the beginning alone is evidence of that.<br/><br/>But not your usual run of the mill fairy tale. This is a more adult version of that. Evidence is the weird love story, but even more a very violent scene that might be quite shocking to many people who are not used to this. Is the movie without fault or flaws? Of course not, but it does convey what it sets out to do. And whether you agree with this winning Oscars or not, or whether you find the story engaging enough, the movie delivers a certain standard that is way above average."

","There is so much wrong with this film. Don't be fooled by the high praise; if it wasn't for the set costumes, colour scheme and Richard Jenkins best performance since The Visitor (a depressed lonely writer) I'd be giving this film a much lower score. 
Sally Hawkins is so annoyingly childish and immature that it is impossible to fall in love with her character and feel any sense of hapliness when she finally finds true love. Shes also very sellfish, notice how she never thanks Octavia Spencer for punching in her time card every day. Shes also refuses to eat the cake Giles bought for her , then expects him to take care of her lover every day and doesnt even aplologise when he eats her cat.
Michael Shannons character is discomforting. The only development given is that he doesnt go to the toilet normally and likes to drive a flashy teal car. Were also given a completely irrelevant shot of him and his wife in bed. 
On top of this there are numerous plot hole that we are just expected to ignore. And theres also a ridiculous black and white dance scene between Elisa and fish man. All in all, dont waste your time on such an awful film."

","There's a very good reason why Guillermo del Toro is one of my favorite directors: he is just brilliant! This film perfectly justifies the statement. It is simply put one of the most amazing and unique love stories I've ever seen. Sally Hawkins is excellent as a mute woman who's ordinary life soon turns extra-ordinary. Doug Jones is great as the creature (looking very similar to Hellboy's Abe Sapien character - also played by Doug and directed by Guillermo). The entire production was masterfully done and the visuals are awesome. This is a very special and highly effective film about the different levels of loneliness. An instant classic, and a masterpiece at that."
"aarosedi","Null","1","7","16 March 2018"," Fish-men likes them mute lovers
","A melancholic, saccharine-infused fairy tale strictly aimed for the mature audience. <br/><br/>Mr. Del Toro presents the audience his tribute to the American's technological might during early '60s and prolific pop culture attached to it, but all the while not forgetting that this was also the time when some of the prejudices (racial, homosexuality and communism) pervades. As with that certain tobacco product's slogan during the '70s that says, ""(We've) come a long way, baby."" Yes, indeed, freedom from some of the biases that have already been dismissed as deplorable now, that is. Though, of course, there are parts of the world that are still the exception.<br/><br/>Hawkins' impeccable nuanced performance as a mute cleaning lady in a research lab is an astounding feat that is antithetical to the crisp, discernible voices of the supporting players: Jenkins as Elisa's caring, closeted-gay neighbor, Spencer as her candid co-worker/translator and Shannon as a harsh Korean war vet in charge of studying the aquatic creature to whom the unspeaking cleaner would fall for. This film does not have conversations between characters that demonstrate wit and showcase ornate lines of dialogue or verse, but the eloquence of these three distinct marvelous supporting actors make up for it, for there is that certain musicality in the way they speak. <br/><br/>What resonates throughout the film that is an abundance of interplaying disparate elements, both subtle and explicit, a sort of visual and emotional poetry, where the set production, the musical score and sound, cinematography, creature makeup, VFX are all first-rate. <br/><br/>The significance of Elisa's color choice in clothes, or Giles who can't help but be compelled into buying the Key lime pie at the pie shop, or Strickland mesmerized by the teal-colored Coup de Ville. And then there's that overt exhibition of racism in public contrasted by one of the most underwhelmingly awkward display of harassment ever depicted on screen. Real life issues well-rendered and explored in a fantasy-romantic film that only a director with Mr. Del Toro's flair and objectivity could effortlessly pull off, whether be it forcing the viewers to see the film with a grain of salt especially when it comes to the admiration and acceptance of an unsightly creature as half of a romantic pair or to suspend their beliefs regarding condoning issues as anathematic as bestiality.<br/><br/>My rating: A-flat."

","A classic kids fable - girl meets fish-monster, girl loves fish-monster, bad guy hates fish-monster and chains him up, girl rescues fish-monster, girl and fish-monster live happily ever (after after it turns out fish-monster can survive gun shots but not extended periods out of water), bad guy meets grizzly end. There I just saved you two hours!<br/><br/>Indeed I was thinking as I was watching it that were it not for the sex scenes and graphic violence it would easily be suitable for my 10 year old. <br/><br/>Sure, it's nicely shot and there's some good references to early 60's culture and music but it's a bit unbelievable to imagine that a cleaner would have un restricted access to a top secret area and then when the monster goes missing not at all be suspected for the crime. <br/><br/>Some of the scenes and dialogue is garbled and perhaps I was missing the point of the Cadillac scene and the pie shop. It just seemed like 'filler' to me but maybe I missed the artistic depth or something? And what the hell was the dance scene all about?<br/><br/>Weird that bestiality is condoned to such a degree - did we really need to know how the monster's penis works? Couldn't their love just be 'implied'?<br/><br/>Not a terrible film, just a very odd one which had it not been framed as an 'adult' movie could easily just have been a kids film.

It would not matter very much if the ""message of tolerance"" conveyed all along had any intelligence or at least some subtlety. Alas it is a barrage of valueless, overdone stereotypes.

several uneducated idiots that simply do not like, or fully appreciate something as brilliant, as the movies of
Guillermo del Toro. The Shape of Water is an extraordinary movie.<br/><br/>And those people leaving scores of 1/10 or 2/10 are just behaving pathetic, petty, and absolutely ridiculous.<br/><br/>The acting talent on display in The Shape of Water is absolutely wonderful, alone.
And Sally Hawkins and Michael Shannon give an acting masterclass.<br/><br/>Also, enough superlatives and high praise cannot be said of the very versatile and extremely gifted, Doug Jones.
Who apart from his collaborative links to several other Guillermo's movies, is also brilliant as, Commander Saru,
in Star Trek: Discovery Tv series.<br/><br/>There are several reasons why The Shape of Water has won four Oscars and another 134 different awards, and that is,
it is an outright visually stunning masterpiece. And the only reason for me not giving it, the perfect 10/10 score,
is simply because Guillermo's Pan's Labyrinth is his very best film. It is perfection personified.

","I don't know if Guillermo del Toro actually made this bet with someone or just challenged himself to do it. In either case the gamble paid off.<br/><br/>What does a filmmaker, a magician or anyone else who is the best of the best do to challenge themselves? If you can do something faster and better than anyone else, what's next? Well, let's see if you can do it while holding your breath underwater...<br/><br/>Along with all of the other wonder and fantastic accomplishments of this film, the goal of seamlessly spanning all possible genres was probably the most ambitious. While I was watching this film and noticed the genre-bending nature of the beast, I thought, ""Is that what he's trying to do? Hit all of the possible genres?"" Spy thriller, romance, campy comedy, horror, period drama and dozens more... My answer came later in the film when a character began to sing -- a musical -- bingo! Yep, that's what he's doing, he wants to hit all the genres. That, and a million others things that filmmakers try to do in their films: send a message, create art, evoke emotion, tell a story...<br/><br/>And he was successful at them all -- including the genre-spanning feat. I recently panned another film in a review here for mixing genres and styles because it was obvious that that other film did it by mistake. But I'm praising 'The Shape of Water' for spanning genres because it intended to. No one else has ever successfully done it before, not to this extent, but now del Toro has, with perfection.<br/><br/>If you've read my other reviews, you know that I normally try to give a critique of a film's racial inclusion and treatment, but I actually saw this film awhile ago and I honesty don't remember enough details to do that here. In any case, one of the messages of this film is that love has no boundaries, not of race, not even of species. I wish more movies included this type of message. We need it.<br/><br/>So what kind of film was this? Some see a comedy, some see a fantasy, others just see a monster movie. What are the contours of this genre?

"dr_clarke_2","9","0","2","11 June 2020"," Another del Toro fairy tale for adults
","Guillermo del Toro's 2017 film The Shape of Water won many accolades, including the Academy Award for Best Picture. It certainly won't disappoint del Toro fans, although as Oscar winners go, it's something of an oddity.
The Shape of Water is an adult fairy tale (a description provided by a behind-the-scenes documentary on the Region 2 DVD release) about a mute woman - Elisa Esposito - who falls in love with an ""Amphibian Man"" being held captive at a top-secret military base in the United States. The Americans want to dissect him, the Russians want to study him, and Elisa simply wants to set him free. Elisa ultimately succeeds, with some help from fellow top secret base cleaner Zelda and her friend Giles, the trio rescuing the Amphibian Man and thwarting evil and sadistic Colonel Richard Strickland in the process. In story terms, there are very few surprises: good triumphs over evil, despite a few obstacles, resulting in a happy ending.
But as is usually the case with Del Toro's films, it is the window dressing that makes this straightforward plot attractive. The characterisation is very effective: this is a film about outsides, with mute Elisa, Black and often-patronised Zelda, and closeted homosexual Giles teaming up to defeat the callous military might of the US, represented by Strickland. This theme of outsiders triumphing is never more obvious than when Elisa finds true love with the Amphibian Man in her bathroom: that a film which prominently features interspecies sex could win an Oscar is frankly astonishing; the fact that it wasn't even particularly controversial is a testament to del Toro's skill as both a filmmaker and a storyteller.
As in Hellboy and Pan's Labyrinth, del Toro (who co-wrote the screenplay) provides a deliciously nasty villain, in this case Strickland, who is driven, cruel and often petty. As in most of del Toro's there's a monster; in this case the Amphibian Man might seem to be it, but Strickland more accurately fulfils that role. Michael Shannon is perfectly cast as Strickland, almost stealing every scene he's in with a pitch perfect performance that conveys every one of the character's twisted emotions utterly convincingly. But he gets a run for his money from Sally Hawkins, who takes the leading role of Elisa and spends the entire film giving a masterful acting performance without uttering a single line of dialogue outside of a very brief fantasy sequence.
Everyone is well cast here, from the underrated Richard Jenkins as Giles and Octavia Spencer as the quietly loyal Zelda, to Michael Stuhlbarg as Russian spy ""Robert Hoffstetler"", who sees the Amphibian Man not just as a prize for his Soviet masters, but as something beautiful to be preserved at all costs. And of course Doug Jones, who has regularly appeared under heavy prosthetics in del Toro's films, also gives an impressive, dialogue-free performance.
And then there is the direction itself. Typically for del Toro, the visuals are very distinctive, from the sets to the Amphibian Man himself; del Toro has cited Terry Gilliam's work as an influence and it shows. There are characteristic lashings of gore, with Strickland losing his fingers early on and having to have them reattached, the Amphibian Man eating one of Giles' cats, and Strickland brutally torturing the dying Hoffstetler. Alexandre Desplat's soundtrack adds significantly to the atmosphere, since it captures the fairy tale feel of the plot.
Whilst the simplicity of the storyline will disappoint some audience members, that simplicity is the film's strength, or rather one of many strengths: The Shape of Water is another impressive addition to del Toro's curriculum vitae, and further demonstration after Pan's Labyrinth that fairytales are sometimes just too dark for kids."

","The Shape of Water is about a mute woman Elisa (Sally Hawkins), who befriends and later falls in love with an amphibian man (Doug Jones) who was captured by Richard Strickland (Michael Shannon). Along with her coworker/friend Zelda (Octavia Spencer) and neighbor/friend Giles (Richard Jenkins), Elisa saves the amphibian man from the lab before Strickland has a chance to kill him. While waiting to set him free, the two fall in love. In the end, it's revealed that she and the amphibian man share some sort of biological connection as the scars on her neck turn out to be gills. They live happily ever after, it is assumed by Giles's voice-over at the end of the movie, which is exactly what you'd expect from a romantic fairy tale.<br/><br/>I feel that this is a movie that, if you suspend your disbelief, will feel like a magical and beautiful fairy tale. If you start to question things, it'll seem stupid. I think both viewpoints are valid, and sometimes it's just whether the movie ""works"" for you that you can suspend your disbelief. For example, I think David Lynch's Eraserhead is just dumb, but David Lynch's Mulholland Drive is also one of my favorite movies. In one movie, I was able to suspend my disbelief, in another, I I just couldn't.<br/><br/>So yeah, If you see this as mute chick having sex with fish guy, this movie will suck. And yes, the twist lends some validity to the relationship, but I don't think it's enough if the movie doesn't ""work"" for you. But if it does ""work"" for you, the twist removes that gnawing back of your mind thought of ""she's having sex with a fish guy.""<br/><br/>Outside of that...
Michael Shannon as Strickland (""Strict land"".... hmmm). Wow, he is just amazing in the movie. Everyone is great by Shannon is just perfect in his role.<br/><br/>The music, especially Elisa's theme, has that nice dreamy, fairy-tale waltz, aquatic feel to it. Beautifully fits into the movie.<br/><br/>The cinematography.<br/><br/>The Easter eggs or connections you find (Elisa and the amphibian man both being mute, Elisa wearing more and more red as the movie goes on, amphibian man killing Strickland by slashing gills on his neck) make for an enjoyable second viewing.<br/><br/>I think the only downside for me was the fantasy dance scene. I read it was meant to be an homage, and that's all well and good, but I found it ""cringy"" and goofy and took me out of the movie for a bit, which was a shame."

With this cornyness, inherent to the fairytale nature and 60's aesthetic, comes a breeze of simplistic story telling that does nothing more or less than captivate.<br/><br/>I felt for each and every character in this movie, including some sympathy for Michael Shannon's grizzly government agent with questionable ethics. His character, though obviously dubious, faces some troubles that make him relatable in a way that make us understand why he does everything he does even if we disagree with those things.<br/><br/>But the stars of the show really are the Creature and Sally Hawkings, who both give sincere and honest portrayals of their likeable roles. The movie could not have worked without them putting on a good show and they thankfully did.<br/><br/>My only complaint is that the subplot with the KGB agent was quite weak. I feel as though having that character just be a normal scientist who isn't a Russian spy would have saved some more time to focus on more character stuff, or just made the movie slightly shorter. In the end it felt unnecessary to have him be a spy as all the agents die anyway.

The way the main characters use sex seems to illuminate the crass shorthand that other films use to show their sympathetic characters as lonely and their evil characters as sex-starved maniacs. In this film, their personalities and their pasts and their place in the world drive them. All the players in fact are as at the top of their game. The themes and allegory are all very current and although the ending is the weakest part, I'm still eternally grateful that this film exists at this place in time and this place in Del Toro's career; not as impersonal as Blade 2, not as ugly as Cronos, not as trial and error as Hellboy, richer than Pan's Labrynth, meatier than Crimson Peak; Besides Devil's Backbone, The Shape of Water probably represents the best Del Toro has to offer."

"cpowchuk-14765","7","0","2","10 February 2020"," Another great movie based on another similar story.
","Once again The Shape of Water turns out to be a rip-off of another similar story, a movie called ""Splash"" starring Tome Hanks and Darryl Hannah.
In Splash, a man (Tom Hanks) finds and falls in love with a mermaid (Darryl Hannah) and they have alot of sex, but are soon found out by the evil government. They capture her and keep her in a holding tank, inside a government building. Tom concocts a plan to rescue her and set her free, in the ocean. Tom ultimately, dives into the water and realizes that he can breathe under-water. Splash is a romantic-comedy.
In The Shape of Water, the fish-man is captured first and held in a government building and a woman (Elisa) meets and falls in love with him, she concocts a plan to rescue him from the evil government and set him free, in the ocean. They have alot of sex and make it to the waters edge, where she is injured, however once in the water, she realizes that she can breathe.
The Shape of Water is a romantic-drama. BUT, it is the same story.
The Shape of Water received all kinds of praise & accolades & awards, for being interesting & unique, whereas Splash barely registers on the map. Its not really a fair comparison, especially when Splash came first and was a much better movie."
"Andy_MJD","8","0","3","4 February 2020"," Maybe not film of the year, but still great
","Interesting blend of fiction and drama. I liked the diversity which was almost always nicely fitted in and/or added something (if not at the very least not actively ruining the movie, except for that gay scene. Added nothing to the whole movie, wasted a good 5 minutes, other than saying ""aw shucks the 60s sure were racist and homophobic"" which is not the plot of this movie). Main villain was interesting, despite being a wholly hateable character (not like Thanos~~).<br/><br/>Very good film, but definitely not what I would've called film of the year."

","I appreciate that this probably isn't to everyone's taste - but I really enjoyed it. Set in 1960s America this is a story about a mute woman ""Elisa"" (Sally Hawkins) who ends up working as a cleaner at a top secret military facility where an aquatic creature is being held captive/experimented upon. Over the course of the film, she befriends him and they establish a bond despite the cruel treatment he is receiving from a truly unpleasant ""Colonel Strickland"" (Michael Shannon). Octavia Spencer is also superb as her close friend who interprets for her and ends up being her partner in crime. This is story about humanity (and inhumanity), trust, hope and ultimately vengeance filmed in a magnificently enigmatic fashion by Guillermo del Toro and scored by Alexandre Desplat."
"knight-36427","7","0","2","7 January 2020"," Shape over substance and yet some wonderful moments
","Del Toro gives great importance both to the design of his creatures and their majesty: the Shape of Water is a wonderful monster of a movie indeed, one of those few movies that manages to create memorable sceneries but still make them coherent with the story and its themes. Not a single moment is wasted, everything is functional, even the silly sequences here and there. Differently from Pan's Labyrinth though, it's the movie's message that feels a bit cliché: it's not too different from tales we've already heard like Frankenstein, and the usage of the Cold War as a setting is little more than a macguffin for the second act of the story. Theoretically, the time period is functional to depict an age where America was constantly afraid of the ""other"", the stranger, the different one. But Del Toro isn't really telling anything new here. It's just telling it in the most poetic and ""fairy tale""-like way possible. And it works"

"RatedVforVinny","8","0","4","20 December 2019"," Amazing creature, with a very sensitive and delicate touch.
","The celebrated (Mexican director) G. Del Toro, has created such a moving film and at times a piece of intrinsic beauty. The amphibian type man, looks (most likely intentionally) like 'The Creature From the Black Lagoon' but has the most marvelous and realistic effects. The story is very similar to that of 'King Kong', dealing with the relationship of a young woman and a freak of nature. 'Shape of Water' takes this theme to another level (as they let their bodies unite) but it's ultimately a (deeper) love story. Stars one of my favourite actors Michael Shannon, who previously played 'The Iceman' (the most dangerous man who ever lived). Right here, he reprises that dripping with menace vibe and controls his performance, with the desired intensity. Falls into the 'Art House' genre but also a picture of conviction (minus the usual pretension). Life is just a shipwreck of our plans."

"cpowchuk","7","0","6","4 October 2018"," Simply a remake of SPLASH 1984
","I couldn't understand why this film got so many awards. The movie is good, very heartfelt and warm. I've watched the movie twice now and I am baffled by all the hoopla. 
This movie is nothing less than a remake of the 1984 movie SPLASH starring Tom Hanks and Daryl Hannah. The the movie SPLASH - Tom Hanks plays Allen who finds a mermaid at the police station and takes her home. They fall in love, have sex and just whens everything seems to be going their way, the mermaid is captured and put in a government facility where she is kept in a watery tank. Allen and his friends then rescue the mermaid and take her to the dock where she escapes. Allen jumps into the water and they swim away together.
In the movie SHAPE of WATER a mute woman named Eliza discovers a fish-man who has been captured by the government and is being held in a watery holding tank. She becomes friends with fish-man and with the help of her friends she rescues fish-man and takes him home. They fall in love, have sex and Eliza plans to set him free at the dock. Eliza and fish-man make it to the dock, Eliza is shot by the evil bad man. Fish-man kills the bad guy and picks up Eliza's body and jumps into the ocean, where she is healed, and we assume they swim away together.
It is pretty much the exact same story. I would call SPLASH a romantic comedy, whereas SHAPE of WATER is more of a romantic drama.
Another thing I didn't realize was that Eliza was apparently a similar creature to fish-man??? Why wasn't that made clear at some point during the movie. I didn't find out until I read it online? It's a good movie SURE but definitely not as good as I thought."
"jamesrupert2014","7","0","6","4 October 2018"," Less than expected
","Given the science-fiction/fantasy premise and the accolades (including a best Picture Oscar), I had very high expectations for this film. I liked the first half, especially the development of Sally Hawkins 's 'Elisa' character and her friends Giles (Richard Jenkins) and Zelda (Octavia Spencer ) but was less impressed by the grimmer second half, which focussed more on Strickland (Michael Shannon) an over-the-top bad guy. I also found the idea that Elisa was having sex with the gill-man faintly ludicrous (although I know that in fetish/furry circles, cross-species sex is highly diversified and inclusive). Despite Guillermo del Toro's imaginative story, the fantastic cinematography, music and excellent design work, the jarring mix of romantic/sexual and whimsical/brutal didn't work for me (but I can see how other people might love the film)."
"imseeg","7","0","2","5 August 2018"," Romantic fairytale. A bit too much sugarcoated and too little drama for my taste. Lovely movie anyway, but not the masterpiece I expected it to be...
","A romancic story with a twisted fantasy plot and a few horror elements mixed in for good measure. A mute cleaning lady saves an alien creature from death and hides it from the government, who wants to kill it. Will she be able to protect the alien from harm?<br/><br/>It could have been a big hollywood standard romantic movie, but director Guillermo del Toro mixes in some ingredients usually not found in Hollywood romances, (masturbation, homosexualtity, torture) which makes it only suited for 16 years and older. It could have easily been turned into a movie for all ages though, just like E.T, if the story had been softened a bit. Or it could have been as dark as his earlier masterpiece ""Pan's Labyrinth"", if the director had gone wild with horror, but the director chooses to compromise and now the end result has become a bit bland. Not a great romance, but not a great fantasy horror either. I fear this movie has fallen prey to the mediocre standards of Hollywood, because it wants to please everyone. And it did, because everybody liked it at the oscars.<br/><br/>Maybe it was supposed to be funny at certain moments, but it didnt make me laugh really out loud once. But it did put a gentle smile on my face though. The story is a bit slow in the middle, that is its biggest flaw. Half an hour could have been cut out easily, without hurting the flow of the story. I really felt that the story lacked suspense and speed in the middle.<br/><br/>Fortunately the ending has got a great climax. But I must be honest about the fact that I dont really understood the hype about this movie. A bit too much sugar and a bit too little drama. That would be my criticism. Lovely movie anyway...having just watched it for the second time..."
"SamALMan","3","0","6","24 July 2018"," A fairy tale for adults
","A movie on a love story.. fairy tale ""like"" love story. Lot of things do not look logical but so in ""fairy tales"". <br/><br/>A creature of an unknown origin was found and transferred to a government owned facility where the protagonist ""Elisa"" work as a cleaner.. she got interested when her eyes fell on the new creature (like she do with many things she faced in her life as the movie shows). She wasn't shown as weak woman, but clever and innocent.. but even though it was shown also that women in the 60s are silenced in addition of her's. She has friends that also share with her the forced silence in community.. she recently meet a new friend that will join the group if she does not intervene, and that's what she did.. she did what it seems to be right.<br/><br/>I love the group of actors and actresses in this movie, they delivered a very realistic feeling (even though some actions were not realistic!). The set and the visuals effects were superb and these were the main attractions for this movie for me. I would say that the expected simple actions or responds were really absent from this movie..most of the characters surprise me with their responds except for (Sally Hawkins) and (Michael Stuhlbarg) where their characters showed reasonable responds to situations. <br/><br/>This movie reminds me of the fairy tale (the little mermaid) but with some twist (this twist won't be understood until the end of the movie!)."
"neil-476","7","0","4","1 May 2018"," Sunk by Stupid
","An amphibious humanoid is brought in to a government laboratory in 1960s Baltimore. Officer Strickland seems to have it in mind to research the creature to death, preferably via torture. Lonely, horny, mute cleaner Elisa spots a similarly alienated sole in the creature. She communicates with him via jazz records, sign language, and boiled eggs. And she hatches a plot to break him out of captivity...<br/><br/>I heard good things, I like Del Toro's work, this is my kind of (geek fantasy) film, and it won Best Film this year. So why was I disappointed?<br/><br/>The idea is good - the Creature From The Black Lagoon in a doomed romance with a damaged woman, and a sadistic baddie looming in the shadows. The performances are excellent. Sally Hawkins is heartbreaking, Doug Jones' physical presence is, as always, flawless, and Michael Shannon is chilling. He's over the top, but he is supposed to be. <br/><br/>The execution is mostly good, but here it is in the execution where things start going downhill. I think we are supposed to look beyond the credibility of the situation and accept the film as a work of art. But I found this difficult. I could accept Elisa hesitantly croaking accompaniment to one of the records, especially after discovering the creature has an ability to heal (which is never explained or explored). I was less accepting of the full-blown Hollywood song and dance routine which followed.<br/><br/>Ultimately, what sunk the film for me was the bucketsful of Stupid and unanswered questions, especially in the latter half. Why did no-one try to communicate with the creature? Why were they intent on destroying him sadistically? Why did the laws of physics not apply in Elisa's bathroom? What was the point of Strickland's bloodied handkerchief. Why didn't they just take the creature straight to the sea? These are a mere handful - there are many more.<br/><br/>I wanted to love this film. I admit that I liked it, but there was so much wrong with it that I should have liked it a whole lot more. Yes, it's a fantasy, a romance, a fable, but it didn't have to be so dumb."

"frode-hauge","7","0","2","2 March 2018"," Overhyped, but good.
","This is not a revolutionary movie. Heck, if you ever watched a movie before, you'll know the general gist of how it ends within the first few minutes. I mean that quite literally. You'll think ""oh, this scene would not be here unless a scene so-and-so will come later, because this scene by itself is nowhere near important enough to spoil a PG-13 rating"". There's a second scene as well, which I can't mention without getting into potential spoiler territory for the first-time movie viewer. It's in the first five minutes, though (again, literally).<br/><br/>But, still, I found it endearing. I'm of an age and life situation where I have a soft spot for romance. Also, I really love Sally Hawkins. There was nothing much awry with it. Great acting, direction, and so forth. There just wasn't anything particularly special about it. A standard story told very well. I'd certainly recommend it, but it got way overhyped."
