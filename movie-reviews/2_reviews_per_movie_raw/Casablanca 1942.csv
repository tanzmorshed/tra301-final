"Jaymay","10","314","339","23 August 2003"," HOW TO WATCH THIS MOVIE
","There are literally hundreds of comments about this movie on IMDB.  Many of them exhort its greatness.  I don't disagree with them.<br/><br/>But I'd like to add a suggestion to those of you out there who haven't seen this film.  I'd like to tell you HOW to watch it.<br/><br/>The people who made this movie didn't think they were producing a masterpiece. Bergman left the shoot disgusted.  The screenwriters were on salary for Warners, writing half a dozen movies a year, and this was just one more.  Bogie was punching the clock in the middle of a workhorse career.<br/><br/>So as an audience member, you can't sit down expecting gilded greatness.<br/><br/>Don't have a Casablaca party.  Don't watch it on your first date, hoping it will lend that ""Romantic Touch.""  Don't watch it as part of your ""I need to watch the Best 10 movies of all time"" Film School project.<br/><br/>Buy this movie on DVD.  Have it at the ready.  And then, one Friday night, when your plans fall through and you find it's 10:30pm and there's nothing on TV that's any good, open a six pack of beer, or pour yourself some wine, and watch this movie in a darkened room.<br/><br/>The characters in Casablanca are absolutely devoid of sentimentalism.  Every one of them sees the world without a hint of rose color in their lenses.  As Rick says, ""Three little people don't amount to a hill of beans in this big old world.""  If you're in a mood where you understand what he's saying, watch this movie and it will transport you.<br/><br/>There is no single movie that deserves to be called the best movie of all time.  Because movies, when all is said and done, don't amount to a hill of beans.  They are meant to entertain us, not for us to worship THEM.<br/><br/>But no movie has ever known this fact like Casablanca.<br/><br/>
If you watch Casablance this way, with no expectations, with no ""hype,"" you might catch 10 percent of its greatness on one viewing.  And that will be enough to start you on your way.<br/><br/>Happy viewing, kid."

","There is a scene about halfway through the movie Casablanca that has become commonly known as 'The Battle of the Anthems' throughout the film's long history. A group of German soldiers has come into Rick's Café American and are drunkenly singing the German National Anthem at the top of their voice. Victor Lazlo, the leader of the French Resistance, cannot stand this act and while the rest of the club stares appalled at the Germans, Lazlo orders the band to play 'Le Marseilles (sic?)' the French National Anthem. With a nod from Rick, the band begins playing, with Victor singing at the top of HIS voice. This in turn, inspires the whole club to begin singing and the Germans are forced to surrender and sit down at their table, humbled by the crowd's dedication. This scene is a turning point in the movie, for reasons that I leave to you to discover. <br/><br/>As I watched this movie again tonight for what must be the 100th time, I noticed there was a much smaller scene wrapped inside the bigger scene that, unless you look for it, you may never notice. Yvonne, a minor character who is hurt by Rick emotionally, falls into the company of a German soldier. In a land occupied by the Germans, but populated by the French, this is an unforgivable sin. She comes into the bar desperately seeking happiness in the club's wine, song, and gambling. Later, as the Germans begin singing we catch a glimpse of Yvonne sitting dejectedly at a table alone and in this brief glimpse, it is conveyed that she has discovered that this is not her path to fulfillment and she has no idea where to go from there. As the singing progresses, we see Yvonne slowly become inspired by Lazlo's act of defiance and by the end of the song, tears streaming down her face, she is singing at the top of her voice too. She has found her redemption. She has found something that will make her life never the same again from that point on. <br/><br/>Basically, this is Casablanca in a nutshell. On the surface, you may see it as a romance, or as a story of intrigue, but that is only partially correct.<br/><br/>The thing that makes Casablanca great is that it speaks to that place in each of us that seeks some kind of inspiration or redemption. On some level, every character in the story receives the same kind of catharsis and their lives are irrevocably changed. Rick's is the most obvious in that he learns to live again, instead of hiding from a lost love. He is reminded that there are things in the world more noble and important than he is and he wants to be a part of them. Louis, the scoundrel, gets his redemption by seeing the sacrifice Rick makes and is inspired to choose a side, where he had maintained careful neutrality. The stoic Lazlo gets his redemption by being shown that while thousands may need him to be a hero, there is someone he can rely upon when he needs inspiration in the form of his wife, who was ready to sacrifice her happiness for the chance that he would go on living. Even Ferrai, the local organized crime leader gets a measure of redemption by pointing Ilsa and Lazlo to Rick as a source of escape even though there is nothing in it for him. <br/><br/>This is the beauty of this movie. Every time I see it (and I have seen it a lot) it never fails that I see some subtle nuance that I have never seen before. Considering that the director would put that much meaning into what is basically a throw away moment (not the entire scene, but Yvonne's portion) speaks bundles about the quality of the film. My wife and I watched this movie on our first date, and since that first time over 12 years ago, it has grown to be, in my mind, the greatest movie ever made."

"RWiggum","10","494","582","29 March 2004"," We'll Always Have Casablanca
","Spoilers ahead, but then again, who isn't familiar with Casablanca, even if one hasn't seen it?<br/><br/>I've been watching 'Casablanca' over and over again since I bought the Special Edition DVD, and is there any film out there one can watch again and again without ever being tired of it? And does any film appeal to a broader audience? Just everything about it seems to be as close to perfection as it only can be.<br/><br/>But what exactly is so special about it? Is it its great genre mix, never equaled by another film? When we think of 'Casablanca' first, we remember it as a romantic film (well, most of us do). But then again, its also a drama involving terror, murder and flight. One can call it a character study, centering on Rick. And there are quite a few moments of comedic delight, just think of the pickpocket (""This place is full of vultures, vultures everywhere!"") or the elderly couple on the last evening before their emigration to the US (""What watch?"").<br/><br/>But 'Casablanca' is not only great as a whole, it still stands on top if we break it apart and look at single lines of dialog, scenes or performances alone. Is there any other film which has more quotable dialog than 'Casablanca'? 'Pulp Fiction' is on my mind here, and 'All About Eve' and 'Sunset Blvd.' come close, too, but still I think 'Casablanca' tops everything else. And not only is the dialog great, it's unforgettably delivered, especially by Humphrey Bogart (""I was misinformed."") and Claude Rains (""I am shocked, shocked to find that gambling is going on here""). Many of scenes have become a part of film history; the duel of 'Die Wacht am Rhein' and 'La Marseillaise' is probably one of the greatest scenes ever shot (the only I can think of that would rival it for the #1 spot is Hynkel and the globe from Chaplin's 'The Great Dictator'), and the last scene is probably even familiar to the few people who've never seen 'Casablanca'. Am I the only one who is absolutely convinced that the film wouldn't have become what it is today if Rick and Ilsa would have ended up as the lucky couple?<br/><br/>About the performances: So much has been said about the uniqueness of Humphrey Bogart's and Ingrid Bergman's chemistry as Rick and Ilsa, about Claude Rains' terrific turn as Renault, about the scene-stealing performances by Peter Lorre (one of the 10 all-time greatest actors) as Ugarte and Sydney Greenstreet as Ferrari and about Dooley Wilson stopping the show as Sam. I'd love to emphasize here two other performances, one that is not mentioned quite as often and one which is blatantly overlooked: Conrad Veidt as Major Strasser had a really difficult task here, as his character is the only evil one, but still Strasser is not a one-dimensional character, and it took more than 50 years until another actor gave an equally (maybe even more) impressive performance as a Nazi, Ralph Fiennes in 'Schindler's List'. But why no one ever mentions S. K. Sakall, who plays Carl, the jolly waiter at Rick's Café Américain, is beyond me. He has definitely more screen time than Lorre, Greenstreet and Wilson, and probably about as much as Veidt, and he's a joy whenever he's on the screen. I simply love his reaction when the pickpocket (""Vultures everywhere!"") accidentally bumps into him, or the reaction to the ""What watch""-dialog. Or how he says he gave Strasser the best table, ""being a German, he would have taken it anyway"". His performance is simply criminally overlooked.<br/><br/>So is there a weakest link in 'Casablanca'? Every film, no matter how close to perfection, has a minor flaw or two, so one can find them in 'Casablanca', too, if one really tries hard. So yes, one might ask how much sense the entire mumbo jumbo about the letters of transit makes. One might point out that Paul Henreid, although his performance is certainly good, doesn't come close to the greatness of any of his co-stars. However, the film is so close to perfection that I'm almost ashamed that I'm so desperately trying to find less-than-perfect elements.<br/><br/>So whatever films will come, how many sequels will overflow the screen, and how much junk we will have to sit through, one thing is certain if we're desperate to see a great film: We'll always have Casablanca!"

","""Casablanca"" remains Hollywood's finest moment, a film that succeeds on such a vast scale not because of anything experimental or deliberately earthshaking in its design, but for the way it cohered to and reaffirmed the movie-making conventions of its day. This is the film that played by the rules while elevating the form, and remains the touchstone for those who talk about Hollywood's greatness.<br/><br/>It's the first week in December, 1941, and in the Vichy-controlled African port city of Casablanca, American ex-pat Rick Blaine runs a gin joint he calls ""Rick's Cafe Americaine."" Everybody comes to Rick's, including thieves, spies, Nazis, partisans, and refugees trying to make their way to Lisbon and, eventually, America. Rick is a tough, sour kind of guy, but he's still taken for a loop when fate hands him two sudden twists: A pair of unchallengeable exit visas, and a woman named Ilsa who left him broken-hearted in Paris and now needs him to help her and her resistance-leader husband escape.<br/><br/>Humphrey Bogart is Rick and Ingrid Bergman is Ilsa, in roles that are archetypes in film lore. They are great parts besides, very multilayered and resistant to stereotype, and both actors give career performances in what were great careers. He's mad at her for walking out on him, while she wants him to understand her cause, but there's a lot going on underneath with both, and it all spills out in a scene in Rick's apartment that is one of many legendary moments.<br/><br/>""Casablanca"" is a great romance, not only for being so supremely entertaining with its humor and realistic-though-exotic wartime excitement, but because it's not the least bit mushy. Take the way Rick's face literally breaks when he first sees Ilsa in his bar, or how he recalls the last time he saw her in Paris: ""The Germans wore gray, you wore blue."" There's a real human dimension to these people that makes us care for them and relate to them in a way that belies the passage of years.<br/><br/>For me, and many, the most interesting relationship in the movie is Rick and Capt. Renault, the police prefect in Casablanca who is played by Claude Rains with a wonderful subtlety that builds as the film progresses. Theirs is a relationship of almost perfect cynicism, one-liners and professions of neutrality that provide much humor, as well as give a necessary display of Rick's darker side before and after Ilsa's arrival.<br/><br/>But there's so much to grab onto with a film like this. You can talk about the music, or the way the setting becomes a living character with its floodlights and Moorish traceries. Paul Henreid is often looked at as a bit of a third wheel playing the role of Ilsa's husband, but he manages to create a moral center around which the rest of the film operates, and his enigmatic relationship with Rick and especially Ilsa, a woman who obviously admires her husband but can't somehow ever bring herself to say she loves him, is something to wonder at.<br/><br/>My favorite bit is when Rick finds himself the target of an entreaty by a Bulgarian refugee who just wants Rick's assurance that Capt. Renault is ""trustworthy,"" and that, if she does ""a bad thing"" to secure her husband's happiness, it would be forgivable. Rick flashes on Ilsa, suppresses a grimace, tries to buy the woman off with a one-liner (""Go back to Bulgaria""), then finally does a marvelous thing that sets the whole second half of the film in motion without much calling attention to itself.<br/><br/>It's not fashionable to discuss movie directors after Chaplin and before Welles, but surely something should be said about Michael Curtiz, who not only directed this film but other great features like ""Captain Blood"" and ""Angels With Dirty Faces."" For my money, his ""Adventures Of Robin Hood"" was every bit ""Casablanca's"" equal, and he even found time the same year he made ""Casablanca"" to make ""Yankee Doodle Dandy."" When you watch a film like this, you aren't so much aware of the director, but that's really a testament to Curtiz's artistry. ""Casablanca"" is not only exceptionally well-paced but incredibly well-shot, every frame feeling well-thought-out and legendary without distracting from the overall story.<br/><br/>Curtiz was a product of the studio system, not a maverick like Welles or Chaplin, but he found greatness just as often, and ""Casablanca,"" also a product of the studio system, is the best example. It's a film that reminds us why we go back to Hollywood again and again when we want to refresh our imaginations, and why we call it ""the dream factory."" As the hawker of linens tells Ilsa at the bazaar, ""You won't find a treasure like this in all Morocco."" Nor, for that matter, in all the world."
"Sober-Friend","10","20","21","25 March 2018"," A Perfect Film But Let's Clear Up A Few Rumors
","In December 1941, American expatriate Rick Blaine owns an upscale nightclub and gambling den in Casablanca. ""Rick's Café Américain"" attracts a varied clientele, including Vichy French and German officials, refugees desperate to reach the still-neutral United States, and those who prey on them. Although Rick professes to be neutral in all matters, he ran guns to Ethiopia during its war with Italy and fought on the Loyalist side in the Spanish Civil War.<br/><br/>Petty crook Ugarte boasts to Rick of ""letters of transit"" obtained by murdering two German couriers. The papers allow the bearers to travel freely around German-controlled Europe and to neutral Portugal, and are priceless to the refugees stranded in Casablanca. Ugarte plans to sell them at the club, and asks Rick to hold them. Before he can meet his contact, Ugarte is arrested by the local police under the command of Captain Louis Renault, the unabashedly corrupt Vichy prefect of police. Ugarte dies in custody without revealing that he entrusted the letters to Rick.<br/><br/>Now let's clear up some rumors. Muh has been written about ""Casablanca"" but a few rumors often get repeated. One of them is Ingrid Bergman saying ""The screenplay was not completed when they started shooting"". That is not true. Warner Brothers never put a film into production unless they had a complete screenplay. Now they kept a few things secret from Ingrid Bergman. She did not have a complete screenplay. The director and Warners thought they would get a better performance out of her if she did not know a few things. However it was not uncommon for ""things to change"" while a film was in production. ""Casablanca was no exception! <br/><br/>Another rumor was that Ronald Reagan was cast to play Ric! He was only ""thought of"" but for only a few seconds. Almost everyone in Hollywood was until Bogart was cast! <br/><br/>Rumor #3 The film was an out of control production! This is not true! This was shot in 18 days. <br/><br/>Another things people don't quit notice is how fast people talk in this film! The film runs 102 minutes. The screenplay is 125+ minutes. The average screenplay is one minute of screen time per written page! If this film was made by today's standards it would run almost 45 minutes longer.<br/><br/>Now if you never seen the film you are lucky. The film is exciting as it is romantic. Not one minute of screen time is squandered. Today's filmmakers would not know how to make a film like this unless ""Batman"" plays Ric!"
"bkoganbing","10","126","156","8 March 2006"," .....it's still the same old story, a fight for love and glory, a case of do or die, the world will always welcome lovers, As Time Goes By.""
","It's one of the great Hollywood legends how George Raft helped make Humphrey Bogart a leading man by turning down in succession, High Sierra, The Maltese Falcon, and Casablanca. Maybe Raft showed some good sense in letting a better actor handle those roles. In any event we've got some proof in the case of Casablanca.<br/><br/>Check out some time a film called Background to Danger that Warner Brothers did with George Raft that also featured Peter Lorre and Sydney Greenstreet. Had Raft ever done Casablanca the film would have been a routine action/adventure story just like Background to Danger. Instead with Bogey we get that, but also one of the great love stories of the century. <br/><br/>Humphrey Bogart set the standard for playing expatriate American soldiers of fortune in Casablanca. Right now he's between wars running Rick's Cafe Americain in Casablanca in Morocco, an area controlled for the moment by the Vicky French government. He's got his fingers in a whole lot of pies, but Bogey operates with his own code of ethics. He sticks his neck out for nobody.<br/><br/>Nobody except the great love of his life Ingrid Bergman who left him mysteriously in Paris as he was fleeing the oncoming German occupation. She walks back into his life with a husband, Paul Henreid who is a well known anti-fascist leader.<br/><br/>The rest of the film is a contest for Bogey's soul. Torn between his great love, his own anti-fascist beliefs, and certain practical necessities of operating a liquor and gaming establishment in a hostile environment. <br/><br/>So many things combine to make Casablanca the great film it is. Ingrid Bergman's lovely incandescence melding and melting Bogey's cynical screen persona. The indelible characterizations of Peter Lorre, Sydney Greenstreet, Claude Rains, Conrad Veidt and the whole rest of a 100% perfectly cast film. And the revival of a great ballad which serves as Casablanca's theme song.<br/><br/>I say revival because As Time Goes By was introduced in 1931 in the George White Scandals on Broadway by Rudy Vallee. He made a record of it which sold quite a few disks back then. But by the merest of coincidences there was a strike that lasted two years that just began around the time Casablanca came out. The Musicians Union struck against the record companies. With no new records being made RCA Victor re-released Vallee's record and it became a monster hit on revival.<br/><br/>Also when Casablanca came out as if the White House had a personal interest in the film FDR and Churchill had the first of their wartime conferences in----Casablanca of all places. Jack Warner must have said a prayer for that to happen.<br/><br/>There are so many classic scenes and lines from Casablanca you can write a comment just by listing them. But my favorite has always been when the Germans have taken over Rick's place and are singing some of their songs, Paul Henreid goes to orchestra leader and asks him to lead La Marsellaise. With a nod from Bogey, the orchestra plays, Henreid leads them and the rest of the non-Germans in the cafe join in. Over 60 years later, one still gets a thrill from that act of defiance.<br/><br/>Bogart and Rains were nominated for Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor. Any of the others could have been as well. As I said before Casablanca is perfectly cast right down to minor roles like Curt Bois as a pickpocket, John Qualen as a fellow resistance leader, and S.Z. Sakall as a waiter at Rick's. If there was an award for ensemble cast, Casablanca would have won it. As it was it did win for Best Picture of 1943 and best director for Michael Curtiz.<br/><br/>Casablanca will be seen and loved by filmgoers for generations unto infinity, as time goes by."

","The Petrified Forest convinced the world Bogart was a bad guy. And for years he shocked and awed the audience with roles fitting that image. The Maltese Falcon showed a new kind hero, one with an edge. Bogart, with all the right things to say and seemingly never losing his cool. Then came Casablanca and the ages. The man's  man comes with a heart. Arguably, three of his best pictures. All showing a change in a man's character and the depths of what acting is supposed to be. Maybe it was Warner Bros all along. Maybe Bogart was simply Bogart.<br/><br/>What can I say about this film that hasn't been said in over 60 years since its release. Is it a great film? Yes. Is it a showcase for Bogart? If not, than what else. Was Bogart the coolest guy to ever live? Absolutely. Casablanca is a different kind of love story, more likely to infect rather than effect.<br/><br/>She almost makes me believe it every time. When she says, ""You're very kind."" Bergman was more than just beautiful. And with Paul Henreid, Claude Rains, Conrad Veidt and Peter Lorre, cinema magic was created. But to me, Bogart was the greatest actor of all time. It's hard for me to believe he died almost 50 years ago. Every time I watch his films, it's like they were made yesterday. And that's why he is timeless. I'm still trying to figure him out.<br/><br/>""I should never have switched from scotch to martinis."" Is said to be Bogart's last words. A legend, indeed."

War World II demanded all! The words stated by Rick at the airport had their impact: 'The problems of three people don't amount to a hill of beans in this crazy world.'

","Casablanca is a film about the personal tragedy of occupation and war.  It speaks to the oppression of the one side - and the heroism and self-deprecation of the other.  From opportunists, to isolationists - from patriots to disenchanted lovers - the film has everything a man or woman would enjoy.  Bravery, courage, intrigue, romance, beauty and love. Leading actors to please any appetite.  Watching this film is to step back to a world that doesn't exist - yet to know it.  It is to experience lives that have never been lived - but are ""real to you.""  It is to know pain and joy, pride and pity for characters that are a fiction - yet are so real that you can't help but get lost in their story.<br/><br/>Amazing cast, memorable dialogue, unforgettable story.  Through this film, Casablanca will always live in my heart and I will think of its characters as family.<br/><br/>Seeing it for the first time is truly the start of a romance with ideals that will live in you long after credits end."

","I say a 'simple' story because I am writing this piece after almost 77 years of the film's release, but in 1942, this story would have been quite original and new. The film naturally and flawlessly integrates a moving love story with the War backdrop. Bogart and Bergman make you feel the love through their expressions and emotions. Top-notch acting by the entire cast makes Casablanca one of the masterpieces of the 20th century. The film is crisp and fast and manages to keep you hooked throughout with its thriller element. With so many stories going on, you will be hooked to the screen."
"Snow Leopard","Null","97","122","6 December 2001"," A Classic Worth Remembering
","While there's not anything new to be said about ""Casablanca"", it's good to see one of the classics still getting some attention.  By most standards it is at least very good, and there are good reasons why so many still remember it so fondly.  Not everyone who watches it today shares the opinion that it is a classic, but it's still good to see fans of modern movies giving it a try for themselves.<br/><br/>The cast is one of its main strengths, not just Bogart and Bergman but also the fine supporting cast.  Rains, Greenstreet, Lorre, and the others are indispensable to the atmosphere and the story, and each has some very good moments.  It does have its imperfections, but it was not expected to be a classic or blockbuster - everything you read about the production suggests that it was made in a rather slap-dash fashion, under constraints that would have wrecked most other films.  It's not hard to see the little ways that this affected the finished product, such as the times when the plot strains credibility a bit, or the characters seem to behave somewhat oddly.  (In particular, it might have been even more satisfying if Bergman's character had been a little stronger - Ilsa is charming, but that's entirely thanks to what Bergman does with her; the character herself as written seems somewhat shallow.)<br/><br/>But it turned out anyway to be an excellent combination of actors, characters, and story, a combination that more than makes up for everything else.  Different viewers probably remember and enjoy ""Casablanca"" for different reasons, because it seemingly has a little of everything.  While perhaps not perfect, it is well worth remembering and watching."
"jwpeel-1","Null","177","229","11 August 2004"," Of all the classics in all the films in all the world, this is the best!
","This is a film that MUST belong in every video collection in the U.S. is not in the world. The stories about it's making are legendary from the constant rewrites to the apocrypha of casting stories.<br/><br/>What is amazing to me, and the reason I believe it holds audiences almost spellbound in successive viewings, is the connection with the horrors of World War II was almost every single cast member.  Sidney Greenstreet had lost a son in combat, and a number of the cast members fled Europe to escape the ravages of a Hitler regime.  Even the evil Nazi character Major Strasser (played with relish by Conrad Veidt) had left Nazi Germany to escape  almost sure internment and possible death in a concentration camp. Here was a man who was a legend in German film history as the murdering somnambulist (a possible warning about the Nazi soldiers to come?) and because of the vicious anti-Semitism and racism of the Germany of the '30s and '40s, we in America and in Hollywood were given a great gift.<br/><br/>Everyone in this film is fabulous, but it is the chemistry of Rick (Bogart) and Ilsa (Bergman) been truly holds the film together.  When I saw this film almost frame by frame in the limited book series of classic films that were produced in the late 1960s, I was stunned by the subtlety of facial expressions that conveyed so much of Rick Blaine's character by a marvelous actor Humphrey Bogart.  There is a reason why he was named the actor of the century.<br/><br/>While every person in the film becomes a real flesh and blood presence, the story of Rick and Ilsa is the center of this cinema feast.<br/><br/>I must confess that I have seen this picture so many times that I can recite every single line in the movie to the consternation of my wife who can't watch it with me anymore. <br/><br/>The line that sticks out the most for me, and which against cheers from New Yorkers whenever it plays in the theater.  It is when Bogart says to the Nazis seated at his table, ""There are parts of New York I wouldn't advise you to invade.""  And what makes this line so memorable is that Humphrey Bogart did indeed star in another motion picture for Warner Brothers where that very thing formed the basis for the script.  That movie was ""All Through The Night."" I love this movie too, and I'm not even a New Yorker.<br/><br/>There have been many attempts to revisit ""Casablanca,"" but only the original makes you really feel what it was like to live through ""The Good War"" in a faraway place like Casablanca in French Morocco.<br/><br/>Even  though such trickery as midget airport workers, fog machines and cardboard cutout airplanes were utilized, this film convinces through its beautiful story with many layers, and characters that are so well realized.<br/><br/>If you've never seen this movie before, shame on you and see it immediately. If you only seen it once, I believe you will come back to it more than once. This is just about the most perfect film ever made and it is a miracle that that is so considering that there were so many hands in the pie.  (Excuse me for my mixing my metaphors.  It's late, and I get emotional just thinking about this classic film masterpiece.)<br/><br/>Play it again and again and again and again, Sam."
"Danimal-7","10","80","100","27 August 1999"," For all-around entertainment, the best I've ever seen
","CASABLANCA is the best treatment ever of the ancient theme of the love triangle.  Set in World War II Casablanca, a Moroccan city under the control of the collaborationist Vichy French government, the movie starts with a news wire that two German couriers have been murdered and their letters of transit stolen.  Each letter will permit one person to leave Casablanca to a neutral country.<br/><br/>Enter Humphrey Bogart as Rick Blaine, owner of the shady but cheerful Cafe Americaine.  Rick is a cynical and hard-nosed man whose motto is, ""I stick my neck out for nobody.""  Like many a cynic, Rick is an embittered ex-idealist, still nursing his wounds from being abandoned by his lover Ilsa (Ingrid Bergman).  By chance he falls into possession of the missing letters of transit.<br/><br/>Enter Ilsa, who comes to Casablanca on the arm of Czech Resistance leader Victor Laszlo (Paul Henreid), a few steps ahead of the Nazi police.  We now have three people and two letters of transit.  Who will reach America, and who will stay in Casablanca?<br/><br/>I know no other movie that so perfectly balances humor, romance, and drama. The soul of good drama lies in presenting characters with hard choices, and few choices are as hard, or as illuminating of the protagonists' makeup, as the choices in CASABLANCA.  All of the characters must decide what they will give up for love, for honor, and for themselves.  The scenes of Rick and Ilsa's love, years ago in Paris, are some of the finest romantic scenes in cinema.  And the humor, particularly in the person of Casablanca's Prefect of Police, Louis Renault, has contributed dozens of dry witticisms to our everyday language - ""I am shocked! Shocked! - ""The Germans wore gray, you wore blue."" - ""I was misinformed."" - ""It would take a miracle to get you out of Casablanca, and the Germans have outlawed miracles.""  So perfectly blended are these three major elements that you cannot point to a single shot or scene that should have been eliminated from the movie.  Never try to watch only one scene from CASABLANCA; you will inevitably be absorbed until the very end of the film.  It is little short of miraculous that the chaotically mismanaged shooting of this movie resulted in such a magnificent final product; it speaks volumes for luck and for Owen Marks' and Michael Curtiz' post-production editing.<br/><br/>I have never encountered a movie whose supporting cast was so perfectly realized.  Every minor character is a fleshed-out, realistic individual, from Sasha to Carl the headwaiter to Rick's competitor Ferrari to the self-effacing criminal Ugarte.  Claude Rains' Captain Renault (""I'm only a poor corrupt official"") steals scene after scene, and Dooley Wilson's Sam is a refreshingly loyal, charismatic and sympathetic conception from an era when almost all black characters were rendered as demeaning stereotypes. The only character who tastes of the cliche is the villainous Major Strasser, which can be forgiven in a wartime production.<br/><br/>The only film I have ever seen as tautly effective as CASABLANCA is GLORY. Although the 54th Mass.'s story is arguably superior even to CASABLANCA for sheer dramatic power and acting talent, GLORY lacks CASABLANCA's wonderful humor and romance, which causes me to give the edge to Curtiz' classic as the better-rounded movie.  I have yet to see CASABLANCA surpassed.<br/><br/>Rating: **** out of ****."

","While my personal Bogey favorite is still his Sam Spade in 'The Maltese Falcon', his cynical nightclub owner, Rick, in 'Casablanca', is also a standout. Rather than some ""off the cuff"" comments, I'll quote instead from my article on Claude Rains (from March 2000 issue of CLASSIC IMAGES) that pretty well sums up the film:<br/><br/>""It was 1943's 'Casablanca', bustling with melodramatic wartime intrigue, that really put him (Claude Rains) in the forefront as one of the screen's smoothest character actors, almost--but not quite--stealing the film from Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman, as the uniformed Captain Louis Renault who investigates the goings-on at Rick's notorious cafe.<br/><br/>
Nobody associated with the film guessed that it would become a screen classic, least of all its director, Michael Curtiz, the prolific WB director to whom it was just another assignment.  It went on to win the Oscar for Best Film of 1943 with an award for Curtiz' taut direction.<br/><br/>Oddly enough, the film's memorable airport ending was written and conceived just shortly before filming wrapped up, with neither Bergman nor Bogart knowing whether or not she would leave him for husband Paul Henried. Wartime audiences loved the film. Sydney Greenstreet, Conrad Veidt, Victor Francen and Peter Lorre all gave sterling performances and Rains was again nominated for Best Supporting actor.""<br/><br/>And by the way, I disagree with a former comment indicating the black and white photography of this film was primitive as compared to today's. Incredible nonsense!!  As a matter of fact, the film's black and white cinematography was nominated for an Oscar!<br/><br/>Ingrid Bergman was at the peak of her radiant beauty in this one--and Bogey was firing on all six cylinders.

","""Casablanca"" is a timely and timeless classic about a politically neutral saloon owner Rick in unoccupied France at a crossroads of destiny, conviction, and courage in his life. ""Casablanca"" is on the top of every film class's watchlist to study for just about every aspect of filmmaking imaginable. <br/><br/>While the film's plot is air-shut tight and the characterization feels authentic over 70 years later, the main focus of ""Casablanca"" is idea focused. During a time of political neutrality, America was entering the war as was Rick, our hard-on-the-edges protagonist. This can be considered an ""enlist"" film to anyone on the fence. Because of it's conviction-driven focus on ideas and philosophy, and how grounded those struggles feel, ""Casablanca"" remains one of the most well regarded classics of all time. The struggles of Rick are applicable to anyone who watches the film, drawing on universal themes like conviction, courage, compassion, and love. <br/><br/>The character of Rick is a fascinating one on an individual basis. We're set up to a character who's meticulous and thoughtful in the way he does things, paralleled by the chess game he has with no one. At the same time, we know of his loneliness without a partner to play with. We understand the respect he commands with patrons of the saloon yet the deep friendship he experiences with Sam. And while his corrupt inner shell shared with the chief is off-putting like a villain, we know he's ""...at heart, a sentimentalist"" when we learn of his passionate love for Ingrid Bergman's Ilsa. <br/><br/>""Casablanca"" also features some of cinema's most iconic and beautifully crafted cinematography by the great Arthur Edeson and of course the director, Michael Curtiz's masterful control of capturing the romantic moment. Not only on a story-telling, narrative perspective, ""Casablanca"" is worth studying for it's remarkable technical quality. <br/><br/>While the film may be as close to perfect as one can get, some of the third act moments can feel unnatural and forced which could disorient some modern viewers. Nitpicking aside, ""Casablanca"" remains one of cinema's finest pieces of celluloid to date. Anyone looking for another round of film study or a clean dive into old classic films, this would be perfect to start with. It's rich in themes, characters, and intelligence."

","Sunday, November the 20th is the anniversary of Marcel Dalio's death in 1983. It was the end of a serendipitous life. You know him. He was a citizen of the world. Born Israel Moshe Blauschild, in Paris, in 1900, he became a much sought-after character actor. His lovely animated face with its great expressive eyes became familiar across Europe. He appeared in Jean Renoir's idiosyncratic Rules of the Game, and Grand Illusion, arguably the greatest of all films. True to his Frenchman's heart, he married the very young, breathtaking beauty Madeleine LeBeau. He worked with von Stroheim and Pierre Chenal. He had it all.<br/><br/>But then the Germans crushed Poland, swept across Belgium and pressed on toward Paris. He waited until the last possible moment and finally, with the sound of artillery clearly audible, with Madeleine, fled in a borrowed car to Orleans and then, in a freight train, to Bordeaux and finally to Portugal. In Lisbon, they bribed a crooked immigration official and were surreptitiously given two visas for Chile. But on arriving in Mexico City, it was discovered the visas were rank forgeries. Facing deportation, Marcel and Madeleine found themselves making application for political asylum with virtually every country in the western hemisphere. Weeks passed until Canada finally issued them temporary visas and they left for Montreal.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, France had fallen and, in the process of subjugating the country, the Germans had found some publicity stills of Dalio. A series of posters were produced and were then displayed throughout the city with the caption 'a typical Jew' so that citizens could more easily report anyone suspected of unrepentant Jewishness. The madness continued. 'Entree des artistes', a popular film, was ordered re-edited so that Dalio's scenes could be deleted and re-shot with another, non-Jewish, actor.<br/><br/>After a short time, friends in the film industry arranged for them to arrive in Hollywood. Nearly broke, Marcel was immediately put to work in a string of largely forgettable films. Madeleine, a budding actress in her own right, was ironically cast in 'Hold Back the Dawn', a vehicle for Charles Boyer with a plot driven by the efforts of an émigré (Boyer) trying desperately to cross into the United States from Mexico. But the real irony was waiting at Warner Brothers.<br/><br/>In early 1942, Jack Warner was driving production of a film based on a one act play, 'Everybody Comes to Rick's' but had no screenplay. What he had was a mishmash of treatments loosely based on the play and two previous movies. But he had a projected release date and a commitment to his distributors to have a movie for that time slot and little else. Warner Brothers started to wing it.<br/><br/>Shooting started without a screenplay and little plot. Principal players were cast and a director hired but casting calls for supporting roles and bit players continued and sometime in the early spring Marcel Dalio and Madeleine LeBeau were cast as, respectively, a croupier and a romantic entanglement for the male lead. Veteran screen-writers were hired to produce a running screenplay, sometimes delivering pages of dialogue one day, for scenes to be shot the following day. No one knew exactly where the plot would go or how the story would turn out. No one was sure of the ending. And, of course, they produced a classic, perhaps the finest American movie.<br/><br/>They produced a screenplay of multiple genres, rich with characterizations, perfectly in tune with the unfolding events in Europe and loaded with talent from top to bottom. Oh, and they changed the title to 'Casablanca'.<br/><br/>It is so well known, that many lines of long-memorized dialogue have passed into the slang idiom. 'We'll always have Paris', 'I was misinformed', 'Here's looking at you, kid', ' I am shocked! Shocked! To find that there's gambling going on in here!', 'Louis, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship', 'Oh he's just like any other man, only more so', 'I don't mind a parasite. I object to a cut-rate one', 'Round up the usual suspects', and, of course, the oft quoted, apocryphal, 'Play it again, Sam'.<br/><br/>Madeleine LeBeau plays Yvonne, the jilted lover of Humphrey Bogart, who is seen drowning her sorrows at the bar early in the film and who later, to get back at Rick and looking for solace takes up with a German officer finding only self-hatred. She is luminous.<br/><br/>And when Claude Rains delivers the signature line, 'I'm shocked! Shocked! To find that there's gambling going on in here!' the croupier, Emil, played by Marcel Dalio, approaches from the roulette table and says simply, 'Your winnings, sir.' It is a delicious moment ripe with scripted irony, one among many in this film, but one made all the more so, knowing where Dalio came from and what he and his wife had endured to arrive at that line.<br/><br/>I have often wondered exactly when they saw the final script or if they only realised the many parallels to their own lives when the film was released.<br/><br/>Alas, they separated and divorced the next year, both going on to long successful careers. Dalio never remarried.<br/><br/>Late in his career, when Mike Nichols was looking for a vaguely familiar face to deliver a long and worldly, near-monologue in Catch-22, he turned to Dalio. Faced with a hopelessly idealistic young American pilot, Dalio, as simply 'old man in whore house', in tight close-up, delivers a discourse on practical people faced with impractical circumstances, of the virtues of expedience in the face of amorality . Using his wonderful plastic features, now beginning to sag, in a voice full of melancholy, the old man reassures the young man that regardless of what 'grand themes' may be afoot in the world, in the end, little matters but survival."

Casablanca, an amazing story on friendship love and patriotism is one of the best movies I've seen. Magnificent as always , Humphrey Bogart played Rick a saloon owner in Casablanca , an unoccupied region in France during the WW2. His ex lover Ilsa now wife to Victor Lazlo an escaped prisoner of the Nazis come to the saloon owned by Rick in fortuity. With no other choice but to seek help from her ex lover Ilsa tries to persuade Rick to help Victor escape the german to America.
I was infatuated by the performance of Ingrid Bergman who plays Ilsa. She was an absolute peach with her amazing yet painful dialogues.
Casablanca will always be a monumental work in the history of the cinemas."
"ironhorse_iv","9","8","9","3 August 2013"," Of all the review joints, in all the towns, in all the world, you walks into mine. Here's to you, Kid. Casablanca is iconic! Play it again, Sam.
","From 1942, comes a romantic historic drama directed by Michael Curtiz movie based on the stage play Everybody Comes to Rick's by Murray Burnett and Joan Alison. It's early Dec. 1941, American expatriate Rick Blaine (Humphrey Bogart) is the owner of an upscale nightclub in Casablanca, Morocco that attracts everybody from Vichy French, Italian, and German officials; to refugees desperate to reach the still neutral United States; and those who prey on them. Rick stands as an allegory to U.S polities at the time trying to stay neutral and not involves himself into the war affairs. I also think it's cool to point out that Humphrey Bogart himself was a decorated war veteran, and this is reflected in his performance. It wasn't until a former lover Norwegian Ilsa Lund (Ingrid Bergman) and her Czech Resistance leader husband Victor Laszlo (Paul Henreid) came into the bar looking for a way to escape Europe, where he states to question his beliefs. While most people know Casablanca as the exploration of the universal themes of love and sacrifice, people that look more into it viewed it as a political allegory about World War II. Ilsa can be seen as the wealthier of Europe who were able to escape due to their wealth, but whose warnings and pleas were dismissed in the late '30s and early '40s. Victor represents the poorer people of Europe who weren't able to escape and whose discovery prompted the change in attitude. When he appears, Rick finally grasps the true nature of what Ilsa is asking him. The film is set in Dec. 1941, the month in which the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor. That attack changed the course of American history, awakening the nation from political neutrality and thrusting it into the midst of World War II. By Illsa showing up, Rick become a symbol for America to take a stronger stand against the Axis Powers. The film also tells the story of another transformation, that of the local French commander of Casablanca, Captain Louis Renault (Claude Rains). Claude Rains is the second best actor in the film besides Bogart. He plays the role so well. Louis begins the film as a pro-Vichy Nazi-appeaser but winds up a committed partisan of free France. Scenes such as Captain Renault throwing away the Vichy bottle it was meant to shown a rejection of Petain's puppet government. Even the great line near the end, 'I think this is a start of a beautiful friendship' stands for United States becoming allies with the French into stopping the Nazis. There is a great scene in the middle worth checking out, where the Germans start singing and, to combat it, the other patrons start singing the French national anthem was a truly moving part. The use of shadows and lighting makes this movie into one of the greatest film noirs. The use of the spotlight that shines from a tall tower and lights up the city of Casablanca reminds people that they are always being watched. It was a great use of light to represent fear and a threat. The music by Max Steiner was just amazing. The song ""As Time Goes By"" by Herman Hupfeld had been part of the story from the original play; Steiner wanted to replace it, but Bergman had already cut her hair short for her next role and could not re-shoot the scenes which incorporated the song, so Steiner based the entire score on it. So, without Bergman cutting her hair. We wouldn't have that theme. The theme of Sam's piano is the symbolic heart and soul of Rick's Café. All the guests want to sit beside it, because they want to forget their worries by listening. The piano suggests purity, which may be why Louis doesn't even think to look there for the letters of transit. I love the smart dialogue. The exchange between Rick and Louis were funny and brilliant. There is a few criticizes that need to be address. The usual conspiracy-theory gang likes to say that this movie was just propaganda. I didn't care if it's pro-Allied propaganda, it was a good movie. Some people think its basically a rip-off of a previous 1938 movie called Algiers. The writers took the character of Rick from the unproduced play, the theme ""As Time Goes By"" from a failed early 1930s musical and even parts of the dialogue were cannibalized from other unproduced scripts. It's doesn't bug me because it was mixed so well. I honestly don't see how the line 'Round up the usual suspect' is famous. It seems very not important from the rest of the best one liners. I believe Ingrid Berman delivering lines acting was mediocre at best. Her eyes did most of the work. Paul Henreid was indeed a stiff. Henreid did not get on well with his fellow actors and it shows. His character seem plain compare to the others. I didn't like how the movie treat the German actors in the film. The German actors had to keep curfew, as they were classified by the US as enemy aliens and under restrictions. They were frequently cast as Nazis in war films even with the fact that there weren't any uniformed German troops in Casablanca during WWII. Then there is the colorization controversy. Don't see it in color, its work best in Black and White. Trust me. Overall: The story itself is straightforward a realistic romantic movie with political allegory. The film's lasting enchantment is due to its dramatic conclusion and the theme of the inescapable past. The plane theme works because it was the escape of such memories. If you don't get onboard and see Casablanca. You might regard it. Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but soon and for the rest of your life."

I find the audio in Casablanca very consoling because the hubbub of background noises are muffled, so my attention is solely taken in the soundscape of the current scene. And yes that may sound peculiar, but it makes me very relaxed!<br/><br/>Looking at the other reviews, there is not much more to add besides the wondrous tingling sensation I felt when the café stands to sing Le Marseillaise to drown out the singing of the German soldiers, and the slightly comic repetition of Signor Ferrari swatting insects at the end of each scene in which he appears.<br/><br/>To any people of Generation Z put-off by black and white films (or anyone at all for that matter) give up on the Netflix pulp and spend your time watching awe-inspiring films like this!<br/><br/>PS: We'll ALWAYS have Paris."

Listed as ""Warner Brothers Project #410"", this film was supposed to be ""just another film"", but it turned out to be something more.<br/><br/>Starring Humphrey Bogart, Ingrid Bergman and Claude Rains, CASABLANCA tells the story of refugees trying to flee Nazi controlled France (via Casablanca) in WWII. Amongst the denizens of Casablanca, there is Rick Blain, proprieter of Rick's Cafe American - a place where one can buy documents needed to escape, as well as escape - through a bottle.<br/><br/>Humphrey Bogart is perfectly cast as the jaded, ""I stick my neck out for no one"", Rick. He is cynical, corrupt, selfish...but he also has a heart of gold underneath it all. Bogie plays all of these layers - richly - at once, and was rewarded with an Academy Award nomination. He would lose to Paul Lukas for WATCH ON THE RHINE - a film I haven't seen, so can't judge as to the merits of his win. But...based on Bogart's performance...I'd say he was robbed.<br/><br/>Rick's ""partner in crime' is Capt. Louis Renault of the Casablanca police. He is cheerfully and unapologetic-ally played by Claude Rains, who also was nominated (but didn't win) for his performance. These two play off each other brilliantly and the chemistry between these two is evident and I would have LOVED to see another film featuring these two fine performers. I'd say the chemistry between these two actors is a high point in this film, if it weren't for...<br/><br/>Ingrid Bergman as Ilse Lund - a past romance of Rick's. When Ilse and her husband, Viktor Laszlo enters Rick's seeking transit papers to flee the Nazi's, the instant spark and chemistry between Bogart and Bergman is palatable. You can feel the heat between the two of them through the screen and the longing and regret for ""what could have been"" is heartbreaking. If you were to show an example of ""screen chemistry"" the scenes between Bogart in Bergman in this film would be ""Exhibit A"".<br/><br/>Credit for all of this - and for keeping the plot machinations moving forward - is Warner Brothers ""contract director"" Michael Curtiz - one of the greatest Directors of ""old Hollywood."" His credits include the Errol Flynn ROBIN HOOD, James Cagney's Oscar turn as George M. Cohan in YANKEE DOODLE DANDY, CASABLANCA, the Bing Crosby/Danny Kaye WHITE CHRISTMAS and John Wayne in THE COMMANCHERO'S - all big budget, big expectations films that delivered the goods. Curtiz won the Oscar for his work in this film.<br/><br/>Assisting him are the two men who wrote so many memorable lines...twin brothers Julius and Phillip Epstein. They (deservedly) won an Oscar for their screenplay - the only set of Twins to win the Oscar.<br/><br/>The supporting cast - including Paul Henreid, Sydney Greenstreet and Peter Lorre - are exceptional as well, as are great scene after great scene - including the ""Marseilles"" scene and, of course, the fog covered airport scene at the end.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen this film in awhile, do yourself a favor and check it out. If you have NEVER seen it, I envy you the experience of seeing this wonderful black and white film for the first time. It is consistently listed as one of the top 5 films of all time - and earns that ranking. It truly is one of the greatest films - with some of the greatest performances - of all time.<br/><br/>Certainly, if you wanted just one example of Studio ""Old Hollywood"" movie making, this would be the one movie to watch.<br/><br/>Letter Grade: A+<br/><br/>10 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)"

How complete is Rick's moral degradation? Is there any limit to the depravity of the Vichy regime's representative in Morocco? What happened in Paris between Rick and Ilsa? These questions are all addressed simultaneously as the action unfolds with hypnotic acting by both Bogart and Bergman and brilliantly tight plotting.<br/><br/>Some of the other actors are not quite up to the standard of the leads, but I think this is the way films were made at the time, with broader acting by minor parts than we usually see in films today.<br/><br/>So much of this film is now cliche, but that's because it defined modern Hollywood cinema and thus had a tremendous impact on Western culture.

But then again, its also a drama involving terror, murder and flight. One can call it a character study, centering on Rick. And there are quite a few moments of comedic delight, just think of the pickpocket (""This place is full of vultures, vultures everywhere!"") or the elderly couple on the last evening before their emigration to the US (""What watch?"").<br/><br/>But 'Casablanca' is not only great as a whole, it still stands on top if we break it apart and look at single lines of dialog, scenes or performances alone. Is there any other film which has more quotable dialog than 'Casablanca'? 'Pulp Fiction' is on my mind here, and 'All About Eve' and 'Sunset Blvd.' come close, too, but still I think 'Casablanca' tops everything else. And not only is the dialog great, it's unforgettably delivered, especially by Humphrey Bogart (""I was misinformed."") and Claude Rains (""I am shocked, shocked to find that gambling is going on here""). Many of scenes have become a part of film history; the duel of 'Die Wacht am Rhein' and 'La Marseillaise' is probably one of the greatest scenes ever shot (the only I can think of that would rival it for the #1 spot is Hynkel and the globe from Chaplin's 'The Great Dictator'), and the last scene is probably even familiar to the few people who've never seen 'Casablanca'. Am I the only one who is absolutely convinced that the film wouldn't have become what it is today if Rick and Ilsa would have ended up as the lucky couple?<br/><br/>About the performances: So much has been said about the uniqueness of Humphrey Bogart's and Ingrid Bergman's chemistry as Rick and Ilsa, about Claude Rains' terrific turn as Renault, about the scene-stealing performances by Peter Lorre (one of the 10 all-time greatest actors) as Ugarte and Sydney Greenstreet as Ferrari and about Dooley Wilson stopping the show as Sam. I'd love to emphasize here two other performances, one that is not mentioned quite as often and one which is blatantly overlooked: Conrad Veidt as Major Strasser had a really difficult task here, as his character is the only evil one, but still Strasser is not a one-dimensional character, and it took more than 50 years until another actor gave an equally (maybe even more) impressive performance as a Nazi, Ralph Fiennes in 'Schindler's List'. But why no one ever mentions S. K. Sakall, who plays Carl, the jolly waiter at Rick's Café Américain, is beyond me. He has definitely more screen time than Lorre, Greenstreet and Wilson, and probably about as much as Veidt, and he's a joy whenever he's on the screen. I simply love his reaction when the pickpocket (""Vultures everywhere!"") accidentally bumps into him, or the reaction to the ""What watch""-dialog. Or how he says he gave Strasser the best table, ""being a German, he would have taken it anyway"". His performance is simply criminally overlooked.<br/><br/>So is there a weakest link in 'Casablanca'? Every film, no matter how close to perfection, has a minor flaw or two, so one can find them in 'Casablanca', too, if one really tries hard. So yes, one might ask how much sense the entire mumbo jumbo about the letters of transit makes. One might point out that Paul Henreid, although his performance is certainly good, doesn't come close to the greatness of any of his co-stars. However, the film is so close to perfection that I'm almost ashamed that I'm so desperately trying to find less-than-perfect elements.<br/><br/>So whatever films will come, how many sequels will overflow the screen, and how much junk we will have to sit through, one thing is certain if we're desperate to see a great film: We'll always have Casablanca!"

","Love and sacrifice during WWII underlie the story about a café owner named Rick (Humphrey Bogart), and his link to two intellectual refugees from Nazi occupied France. Ilsa (Ingrid Bergman) and Victor Laszlo (Paul Henreid) seek asylum here in politically neutral Casablanca and, like other European refugees, gravitate to Rick's upscale café, near the city's airport, with its revolving searchlight.<br/><br/>Rick is a middle-aged cynic who also has a touch of sentimentalism, especially for people in need, like Ilsa and Victor. The film's story is ideal for romantics everywhere.<br/><br/>Much of the plot takes place inside Rick's café, an ornate nightclub with archways and high ceilings. Rick's is a gathering place for an eclectic mix of patrons, from locals to those who have arrived from countries throughout Europe. It's this deliciously international ambiance of Rick's café that renders this film so appealing, with a variety of interesting accents, clothes, and uniforms. And, of course, there's Sam, the piano player, who plays all the favorites, including ""As Time Goes By"".<br/><br/>All of the film's technical elements are excellent including the script, with its colorful characters, like the debonair Captain Renault (Claude Rains); and Signor Ferrari (Sydney Greenstreet), the articulate and portly ""leader of all illegal activities in Casablanca"". And a minor character that made an impression on me was the guitar playing female singer at Rick's (Corinna Mura), whose beautifully operatic voice was an unexpected delight in this smoke filled saloon.<br/><br/>The film's dialogue, though substantial, is clever and lively, like when Captain Renault observes Rick escorting an intoxicated woman out of the bar: ""How extravagant you are, throwing away women like that; some day they may be scarce"".<br/><br/>High-contrast B&W lighting renders a noir look. And that pounding score at the film's beginning is stunning; it evokes a feeling of far-off adventure.<br/><br/>""Casablanca"" differs from traditional noir films, mostly as a result of its ending. Rick must make a choice between his own interests and the interests of others. The choice he makes enjoins viewers to a sense of courage and optimism, an individual's example of proper collective behavior in the war against Nazi Germany."

","Generation after generation will continue to love this splendid film, just as many previous generations have enjoyed this movie in the past!! (The principle reason for me bastardizing one of this movie's famous quotes) ""Casablanca"" has, undeniably, withstood the test of time!! This film evokes a romantic humanism into the thick of World War II!!! Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman are magnificent as the tormented love interest duo who do not seem to be able to piece everything together, they just know they love each other, and more importantly, something clicks!!! Originally, Ronald Reagan and Ann Sheriden were cast for the roles of Rick and Ilsa, as it turns out, you cannot imagine any two other people besides Humphry Bogart and Ingrid Bergman for the roles!! These two performers exude more of a continental flair!! The American fascination for this flick is thoroughly justified!! Winning the academy award for best picture in 1943, ""Casablanca"" was just one of the many movies in the late 1930's and early 1940's which epitomized an era for excellent movies!! Based on the book ""Everybody Comes To Ricks"", Hal B. Wallis produces this film with a flawless orchestration!! The place, Casablanca, becomes a citadel of despondence and despair for so many people, yet for Rick and Ilsa, (Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman) the situation is tailor made for a passionate redemption!! Max Steiner encompasses a necessary nostalgia with the music in this film. ""As Time Goes By"" (made in 1931) became enormously popular with this movie!! The whole scene is set up whereby Paris becomes a venue for unprecedented and wondrous romanticism!! ""Casablanca"" is, without question, one of the greatest movies ever made!! You must remember this, a movie is just a movie!! Unless!! It is the movie of all time; ""Casablanca""!! I will see ""Casablanca"" over and over and over again and never be tired of it!! EVERYBODY SHOULD SEE THIS MOVIE!! I guarantee you, you will not be disappointed!!! This film has 6 of the top 100 famous quotes in the history of all American film making!! Humphrey Bogart and Marlon Brando may lay claim to the most quotes from this list. Many colloquialisms from ""Casablanca"" have fallen within the realm of popular modern day jargon!! This website ranks ""Casablanca"" 11th best picture out of the top 250. AFI (American Film Institue) ranks ""Casablanca"" the second best American film ever made. I feel this is very impressive!! You will truly marvel at this film, in fact, if you do not think ""Casablanca"" is not one of the greatest films you have ever seen, I will be utterly amazed!!! AN ALL TIME MOVIE CLASSIC!!!!!!"

"Spleen","9","7","9","16 April 2002"," The best of a kind
","Spoilers ahead.<br/><br/>I didn't understand the film properly until I read Danny Peary's essay on it in the first of his three ""Cult Movies"" books (which, by the way, you MUST read, although you should be aware that Peary's complaints about ""The Red Shoes"" aren't even near the mark).  The key (and, in retrospect, obvious) insight is this: all along, Captain Renault WANTED Rick to become a hero again.  As long as Rick was content to adopt a cynical, self-serving attitude, Renault, a man made of lesser material, had an excuse to do the same - and he wanted that excuse to be denied him.  When it WAS denied him he was delighted.  THAT'S he joined the side of the angels, without even hesitating.  (It's also why he spent so much time earlier poking fun of Rick's former idealism, in an attempt to get Rick to defend it.)  This probably strikes many people as obvious; I regret to say I had to have it pointed out to me.<br/><br/>I don't have to argue that this is a great film.  We all know it is.  Peary calls it the ONLY film that's everything the old-style studio films were trying to be, and he's probably right.  This doesn't, of course, mean that it's the BEST film of the 1940s; better still are the bolder, more ambitious productions made by more inspired directors: ""Citizen Kane"", ""The Red Shoes"", ""Fantasia"", and so forth.  But ""Casablanca"" is probably as high as it is possible to fly without making a Philistine studio executive reach for his heart tablets.  This is higher praise than it sounds.  And if you think it IS the best film of the 1940s, after all ... well, I can see your point of view."

No other film depicts the twist of fate and the sacrifice for what is right more than ""Casablanca"". No other masterwork of the silver screen has timelessly depicted the tale of two star-crossed lovers and the hand of destiny. Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman created one of the greatest onscreen romances in film history. The aesthetic black and white, the memorable one-liners, the fashion, the stirring theme song, the flawless acting and the simple, direct unfolding of the story all rounding up to one of the most unforgettable endings in all of filmdom and one knows one is in the midst of a classic.

","This, now iconic, old film owes much of its character to the number of actual refugees from Hitler's Third Reich in the non-starring roles, (Bogart, Bergman, and Henreid aside).<br/><br/>A brief appearance by Peter Lorre is a case in point and even more so is S.Z. (""Cuddles"") Sakall much of whose family was actually wiped out in the holocaust and who has a sizable role in this film as Carl the Waiter.<br/><br/>The inevitable Sydney Greenstreet plays a friendly rival of Rick Blaine's American Cafe and, of course, Dooley Wilson as the pianist and singer Sam of ""play it again"" fame. No Hoagy Carmichael (Bogie's later pianist) he, and so his piano playing had to be dubbed as his voice was not. And Claude Rains as the corrupt Captain Louis Renault (""I'm shocked, shocked"" and ""Round up the usual suspects"")<br/><br/>The Song, ""as Time Goes By"" by Herman Hupfeld was basically the theme song of ""Casablanca"" and was used throughout as part of the complete score.<br/><br/>The villainous Nazi Major Strasser was, of course, played by Conrad Veidt who was not Jewish but whose third wife was. Mr. Veidt, however, told the nazis that he was himself Jewish making it certain that he would have to leave Germany.
 
The now-cliched lines have become part of the lore of filmdom but, of course, this film is where they originated!<br/><br/>This is a film that, with all its faults and its occasional historical inaccuracies, still richly deserves its present reputation."
"JohnHowardReid","10","3","3","27 July 2017"," One of Hollywood's Greatest!
","If ever a movie deserved the year's most prestigious award for Best Picture, Casablanca is it! The tragedy is that Bergman was not even nominated for Best Actress, and that Bogart and Claude Rains both lost! And that Arthur Edeson was passed over for Best Photography is equally incomprehensible! Time has robbed many of the other winners and nominees (Joan Fontaine in ""The Constant Nymph""? Mickey Rooney in ""The Human Comedy""? J. Carroll Naish in ""Sahara""?) of present-day relevance, but Casablanca — the first cult movie — has undoubtedly been seen and enjoyed by a far greater audience than all the other 1943 nominations put together.<br/><br/>What is the reason for this amazing popularity? I'd like to put it down to the picture's excellence in all departments:— its stylish, pacey direction, the enormous variety and drama of its camera set-ups, its sharp film editing and artistic lighting — not to mention its superb performances and engrossing plot. In his fascinating book Cult Movies, Danny Peary feels that audiences respond because ""Casablanca"" contains every element of ideal entertainment — ""Action, adventure, bravery, danger, espionage, exotic locale, friendship, gun-play, humor, intrigue, a love triangle, a masculine hero, a mysterious heroine, patriotism, politics (without being too political), romance, sentimentality, a theme song, a time factor, a venomous villain, and war.""<br/><br/>Yes, Peary is absolutely on the right track. ""Casablanca: provides all these ideal qualities — and more. Rick is not only a masculine hero — but a hero with a romantic past. This is the trait that appeals to women, while men admire Rick's resourcefulness and savage wit. And, as Peary points out, there's not just a simple friendship between the Bogart and Rains characters, but a tension, a respect, a latent guiltiness for abandoned ideals. These three- dimensional characterizations make the film seem so realistic despite its preposterous plot and laughable stage devices such as the irrevocable letters of transit.<br/><br/>Tension is what ""Casablanca"" is all about. The war-time tension of the setting, the tension of the plot, and especially the tension between the characters — not just tension in the broad sense or even tension between the principal figures in the action, but tension between just about every character in the script — between Bogart and LeBeau for instance, between Rains and Veidt, between Curt Bois and Olaf Hytten, between Rains and Joy Page, between Veidt and Sakall, between Kinsky and LeBeau, between Lorre and Bogart, between the Italians and the Germans. This is just the beginning of a list. But then you have inner tension in the characters themselves, particularly Bogart and Bergman of course, but even in minor figures like John Qualen and Dooley Wilson. Only Henreid and Veidt, who both stand for what they see as ideals, are free of any guilt or self- doubts and can be relied upon to act decisively and predictably at any given moment. This is why the climax is so effective and Veidt's action is just what we would expect. <br/><br/>Hard to believe isn't it that a script so perfectly constructed — such a fine meshing of so many disparate elements — was the work of many hands, often working independently and (especially in the latter half of the film) in considerable haste?<br/><br/>That's the picture business. Curtiz's control, mastery and unification of all these elements cannot be over-estimated. And he gives them class, style, polish and atmosphere as well."

","There are movie classics and there are movie classics. And then there is ""Casablanca."" Shot in 1942, it is over sixty years old and more than holds its own against anything that one can throw up against it today. For Humphrey Bogart, this was a career defining moment that launched the Bogie mystique. Ingrid Bergman's performance is nothing less than scintillating. The cast of supporting actors and actresses is superlative. This is one of the rare movies that makes the viewer suspend disbelief. Almost everything in the movie is first rate. The editing was superb with no extraneous scenes. There is no fat. It is a movie in which extremes exist and yet there is no contradiction. It is the rarest kind of movie that can be watched a hundred times and yet, one never tires of it. ""Casablanca"" is pure cinema magic that few, if any, movies will ever match. Words cannot reach it. ""Casablanca"" is an experience that one simply has to experience and preferably, at least once, on a big screen. On a scale of one to ten with ten being best, it is an easy one hundred."
"fcfrancis3","10","3","3","8 August 2003"," Timeless
","Regardless of when the first time you saw Casablanca was, the movie will always remain timeless.

""Of all the gin joints in all the cities in all the world, she comes walking into mine.""<br/><br/>The ultimate tale of love and sacrifice, Casablanca is a movie that despite how much times change, this film never loses its magic. <br/><br/>
From a personal standpoint, I am not that big a fan of older movies (what some people dub ""classics"".  I generally don't like any film made before 1960.  I find the acting generally cheesy.  But along with On The Waterfront, Casablanca is still one of the most amazing movies ever made. Highly recommended.  Don't go to the video store and rent it, just go buy it."

The Paris sequence is corny and embarrassing producing one of the worse lines in cinema history - ""Was that cannon fire or is my heart pounding?"" Yet this film remains my all time favourite. No matter how many times I see it I'm still moved. I get goosebumps when Laszlo encourages the staff and customers of Rick's to sing La Marseilles in response to the Germans singing. I smile at the jokes. I melt at the supreme sacrifice at the end. I nod knowingly at the references to America's neutral stance in the war. I admire the theme of commitment and sacrifice in a time of stress. And I love the colourful, quickly drawn characters given vivid life by smooth, confident actors such as Claude Rains, Sydney Greenstreet and Peter Lorre. Why does it work so well? Is it Bogart in a white suit? Is it the impressionist tour de force opening where every character and every theme is introduced in a fluid journey through Rick's bar? Or is it the totally unpredictable and totally original story-line the conclusion of which could never be guessed, but which feels so right, so heroic, so romantic, so awesome.

The intricate political plot comes first, and sets the movie on a melting pot of the second world war, where everyone hopes and dies for an opportunity to reach the USA via Lisbon. This would provide sufficient material for hundreds of movies, but enter Humphrey Bogart, Ingrid Bergman, magnificent cinematography, role model storytelling, a perfect supporting cast, some of the best dialogue ever commited to celluloid and Dooley Wilson singing THAT song, and history was made.

","Why do I consider this to be the greatest film ever, to begin with I consider it to be the most enjoyable film I have ever watched and the most re-watchable. The key ingredients in my mind include; wonderful dialogue (so many quotable oft repeated lines), amazing performances, a superb story that while relatively straightforward is also highly enjoyable and finally the great black and white cinematography. Beyond these ingredients its also a film moves quickly and I can't think of a single scene I found either uninteresting or unnecessary.<br/><br/>For those that desire a synopsis, Rick (Humphrey Bogart) is an American expatriate running a popular nightclub in Casablanca a city under Vichy control. The cool disinterested facade Rick maintains is shaken when Ilsa (Ingrid Bergman) his former lover whom he thought dead appears suddenly in his club with her husband a resistance leader who requires safe passage out of German controlled territory. In order for the escape to succeed Rick must not only hide them from the Germans but also the local French police commander (Claude Raines) who is a friend but also a collaborator.<br/><br/>My favorite performance here will always be that of Humphrey Bogart as Rick a man of nobility while evidencing ambivalence, but his performance is closely followed by the wonderful Claude Raines and the limited but iconic performances of Sydney Greenstreet and Peter Lorre. While Ingrid Bergman apparently did not enjoy her experience and it may not be among her greatest roles I thought it was still a great performance, and also that the chemistry between Bogart and herself was utterly convincing. Further I found both Paul Henreid in the thankless role of the other man in the love triangle and Conrad Veidt as the local German commander to be quite effective along with a good supporting cast.<br/><br/>As I have seen more and more of Michael Curtiz films I have come to believe he is an underrated director, its true he was not an auteur but a studio director who made the films he was assigned and he was not apparently a pleasant person to work with he has did leave behind an incredible legacy of films."

Almost every 'casual' conversation, brief meeting, or soirée involves hidden meanings or jockeying for position (or information) that I find brilliant, and yet, we are IN on it! <br/><br/>What more could you ask of a movie? There are enough plot challenges and twists that keep outcomes totally unpredictable. The characters are well developed, act credibly, and there are no outrageous plot twists to rig the outcome. <br/><br/>Acting is absolutely first rate by all the main players, with the exception of Paul Henried, whose stiff, mostly reserved personna works in his favor when he leads the legendary and emotional 'anthem competition' scene. <br/><br/>The dialogue seems just MADE for Bogart's cynical, world weary delivery...and his facial expressions are a delight to behold. Bergman is electrifying. Rains should have won an award as the opportunistic, slick, Prefect. Intrigue is EVERYWHERE in this movie, and the minimalist lighting, the heavy shadows, the bars and bar-shadows make this an example of a wholly developed, carefully presented, craftily written movie worthy of top consideration as THE best Hollywood can offer."

Laszlo is a famed rebel, and with Germans on his tail, Ilsa knows Rick can help them get out of the country.<br/><br/>I know, I know. It's quite frankly atrocious that it has took me so long to see this film. I say that because Casablanca is a masterpiece of epic proportions. I genuinely don't think I could name a flaw with this gem of a movie. It is a masterpiece and well and truly deserves its spot on the Film Hall of Fame. If you haven't seen it, then I highly suggest you do.<br/><br/>So what do I like about it? The story was fascinating and interesting and intriguing in all senses of the world. And don't even get me started on that ending. That ending, which I of course won't spoil, is easily one of the greatest endings in cinema history. It is a testament to the magic a GOOD writer can make.<br/><br/>Humphrey Bogart was exceptional as Rick Blaine. I absolutely adore this performance and the character is also truly amazing. Words cannot describe the authenticity and skill that Bogart projects onto Blaine. It is a performance that deserves A LOT more recognition by the average movie goer.<br/><br/>Ingrid Bergman was, also, excellent as Ilsa. She didn't quite outdo Bogart in her performance but I would be lying if I didn't say she came pretty close. She manages to project so much emotion and trauma onto the audience in such a fascinating and spectacular manner. <br/><br/>As far as the supporting cast goes, they were also exceptional. Paul Henreid was excellent as Victor Laszlo and added a very interesting and intriguing character to the already riveting narrative. Claude Rains was excellent as Captain Renault and provided an excellent humorous backbone for the movie. He wasn't necessarily essential to the plot but he was essential to the tone and final product. Dooley Wilson was also excellent in his unfortunately short run as Sam. Truly amazing performances from each and every single member of the stellar cast.<br/><br/>For 1942, this movie is a technical wizard. The cinematography and editing were both incredible. The lighting is visually stunning and worked exceptionally well in the black&white environment. The music and sound effects were also excellent and the visual effects were truly admirable, especially considering the time at which they were created.<br/><br/>As a whole, 'Casablanca' is a masterpiece of a film and I can HIGHLY recommend it. As for flaws, I can not name a single one. It is a work of art and should be commemorated for its massive contribution to film and the art form. Please, if you have not, see this film; I assure you that it is worth your time. I'll rate 'Casablanca' 10 'Half a Thoughts' out 10!"
"smatysia","10","5","6","30 November 2004"," Here's looking at Ingrid Bergman
","Wow! Ingrid Bergman was at her best in this one, as well as her most sad, doe-eyed, beautiful. The part of Rick seemed made for Bogey, with the snappy repartee, and the cynical shell around what Renault refers to as ""a rank sentimentalist"". It seems like every time I see this film I notice something new. This time it had to do with the Bulgarian woman, Annina Brandel, who Rick rescues from the carnal plotting of Captain Renault. I never gave this scene much thought, just assuming that it was a way to plumb the limits of Rick's cynicism, as noted above. But later, during the scene where Ilsa tells Rick that she'll stay with him if he will use the letters of transit for Laszlo, I realized that the two scenes were a common theme, that Rick realizes he'd be no different from Renault if he followed through with that. I guess one gets lazy seeing modern Hollywood fare. Nowadays, the director would have used a flashback image or something, in order to bludgeon the viewer with the correlation. But back then, with a better-educated public, one could allow audiences to discover things for themselves. It was also skillful how these films could be more or less suitable for children, as well as adults. When I saw this film as a child, it never occurred to me that Rick and Ilsa had had sex. But the clues, while too subtle for a child, were pretty obvious to me as a man. Like many people this film is my all-time favorite. Grade: A+++++"

","Every thing positive everyone has ever said about this movie is true.  Still compelling after all these years, one of my top ten movies, I can go back and watch every few years.<br/><br/>This movie works on every level, drama, love story, suspense, but most of all it is a war propaganda movie.  Pro war, pro allies, anti Nazi, even a little anti French, this movie was made smack in the middle of WWII when the outcome was still in doubt and designed get the public behind the war effort.  It sure was more fun then those 'Victory gardens, paper drives and gas rationing' and other techniques to get public support.  It is impossible for a film made for this purpose to stand the test of time, but Casablanca has, and that's why it is such an incredible film."

","What makes Casablanca the greatest?<br/><br/>The detail. After Ugate is arrested Rick moves forward and picks up a small glass that has fallen over. <br/><br/>When Sam is playing 'As Time Goes by' and Rick is drinking to forget (the famous scene) he involuntarily moans from within. He shows the man's heartbreak - the reactions of emotion running through a body broken by booze and sorrow.<br/><br/>This is acting and film making at it's very finest.<br/><br/>The inner decency of Rick is moving as is Ingrid Bergmann's tear filled eyes - but the throat catcher is the singing of the Marselliase and Yvonne's impassioned 'Vive La France!' <br/><br/>This was war time, and the film makes us remember what it was all for. Hollywood should look at the script - how simply it is constructed - and learn - there is a public worldwide that wants scripts of this quality about real people."

","I am not getting into the ""The greatest picture of all-time"" debate. It's too subjective but if I forced to cast a vote, I would give this the most serious consideration. I mean, what aspect of this film isn't top-notch?<br/><br/>The dialog is superb, one of the best ever put on film. The acting is great, cinematography first-rate and the story offers an interesting mix of drama, action, romance, music...you name it. This film has everything but color, which might prohibit of a lot of younger folks from ever checking this classic out. That would be a shame because film- making doesn't get much better than ""Casablanca.""<br/><br/>All of this doesn't mean it's my favorite film of all-time. It isn't even in my top ten but I always find it very, very enjoyable and the latest 2-disc DVD transfer makes it even better to view.<br/><br/>Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman, of course, are the stars but I always found Claude Raines' character the best to watch. His witty dialog as the police chief always makes me smile. He has many clever lines and isn't a guy you can figure out. He and Bogart's character are similar, essentially coming across as people who only care about themselves but deep inside are good-hearted people.<br/><br/>The ending is much discussed and very famous and helps make the movie so revered. There has been so much written about this film that there I won't add more except to make one negative statement but that's about a line in the story and not a reflection on the quality of the film. I wasn't impressed that Bergman, despite being married, was willing to run off with Bogart, claiming she ""doesn't know"" what's right or wrong! Are you serious? Well, judging by the marriage records of Hollywood over the years, maybe they don't know adultery just might be wrong. Anyway, other than that, this is a great movie with many, many classic scenes. Bergman never looked prettier, albeit the aid of soft lens shots on her closeups, and Bogey was never more, well, Bogey, than in here. Add Paul Henreid, Sydney Greenstreet, Peter Lorre and other fine actors and wow, what a cast!<br/><br/>An added bonus is hearing ""As Time Goes By"" throughout the film, a haunting song. Actually, there are several songs played, mainly by pianist Dooley Wilson, and they're all fun to hear. As I said, one could go on and on about this movie. 'Nuff said."

","Spoilers herein.<br/><br/>Bloom said of Shakespeare that he invented humanity. Films will always have less depth than poetry, but they can have a similar, profound effect on popular culture. Movies are seldom about life, but life is often about film, the few films that find the groove.<br/><br/>This film invented -- to a substantial degree -- what it meant to be a post-war American. It is not so much that it was perfect, but that we have remolded ourselves around it, as part of the victor's healing.<br/><br/>I recently saw some other Bogart films (like `Treasure'), and they amazed me in how poorly they worked. How mannered his acting seemed.<br/><br/>We have beautiful faces in other films, even this face (which we still have in Isabella). But nothing seems to compete for the certain archetype of passionate commitment, of pathetic yearning, of immature desire, of refugee desperation.<br/><br/>The interior sets -- and how they are photographed -- show a definite post `Citizen Kane' influence. In fact, one can see much of the Mercury Player flavor in these characters, particularly Greenstreet.<br/><br/>But you know, this film has so melded with dreams that you don't need to screen it."
"Black_Mage_X","10","8","12","4 September 2007"," Casablanca is a movie that proves that early movies are still the greatest films of all time.
","This movie opens up a gateway to the genre of early romance with light drama. Now it is near impossible to find a movie that was made not for the money, not to win awards, but for the people.<br/><br/>At first I thought that this movie was over hyped, but when I sat down and watched it, I realized that the hype was true. This movie delivered everything it promised and then some.<br/><br/>The characters were perfect. Believable, realistic, and you felt like you could relate to them in a way. Humphrey Boggart was the best example. His witty yet sarcastic remarks are still known as some of the greatest lines of all time. My personal favorite being ""Of all the gin joints in all the towns in all the world, she walks into mine."" While the movie did start out slow, it quickly picked up and was able to hold my interest. It was dark, yet was able to throw in light humor without upsetting the balance of a scene. Since it was dealing with a serious issue, which at the time was an incredibly important matter, they had to find a way to deal with the issue without upsetting the balance of the film. A feat that they managed to do well.<br/><br/>There are many memorable scenes in the movie, but my personal favorite is the very end when Rick has to watch Llsa fly off. It is painful for him, but he knows that her staying would only hurt both of them and due to his character he is able to keep his emotions inept, while conveying in his new friend, Louis.<br/><br/>As for changes, I would make none. This film is a masterpiece and wanting to make changes is like editing the Bible or adding finishes to one of Leonardo DaVinici's paintings. As the saying goes 'If it ain't broke don't fix it' I was only 12 when I first saw this film, but I gained much watching it. I learned that while you may not want to do something or say goodbye to someone sometimes it is necessary for the greater cause.<br/><br/>This is a movie I would recommend to anyone who wants drama, romance, comedy, memorable dialogue, or just an all around good feeling. This is a movie I will continue to enjoy for years to come."
"Coventry","10","8","12","16 February 2004"," Here's looking at cinema-perfection, kid
","Out of all the films that are considered classic milestones in cinemahow many fully deserve that status?? Not that many, let me tell youbut Casablanca absolutely does! Casablanca has become history itself, a legendary production that'll live on forever. And it should! This film is essential viewing for everyone who ever showed interest in cinema. Every sequence in Casablanca is brilliant, every character is intriguing and every setting is breath taking. Especially when you're watching it for the first timeyou'll be surprised how much you actually know about it already. Multiple ideas, lines and sequences were so influential and important to cinema, that they have been used numberless times afterwards. You might even say that cinema would have looked completely different if it wasn't for Casablanca. It's a brilliant love-story with irresistible film-noir and comedy aspects. The entire script - line by line - is pure nostalgic and some of the dialogues originally shown here grew out to become pure historical art. This intelligent movie also depends a lot on its superb cast, of course. Bogart portrays a terrific character herea performance that yet has to find its equal. His brute and heartless portrayal of Rick is fascinating, especially because you soon find out that he is in fact just a hurt romanticist, heart-broken by a girl who's about to show up again. This girl (the stunning Ingrid Bergman) is practically the most marvelous lady who ever appeared on the big screen. Thanks to her natural charm and beauty, Bergman makes the most out of Ilsa. Film-noir stars Claude Rains and Peter Lorre supply the film with terrific supporting characters and a right amount of humor and parody. It's amazing how this film combines so many different genres successfully. The cruelty and drama of the war and the rise of the 'Third Empire' is mixed with comedy and romance in a unique way. It cannot be deniedCasablanca is pure perfection and everyone should appreciate it. This film isn't to be missed by anyone, whether you're young, middle-aged or retiredthis film will move you."
"eliz_balaur","1","51","109","24 March 2015"," BORING and ARTIFICIAL. The emperor has no clothes.
","This is the only movie review I have ever written on IMDb. <br/><br/>I watched Casablanca witch high hopes. I KNEW I was going to love this movie after hearing for years how it's ""the best"" and what an amazing, moving, love story it portrays. I was very excited and ready to be swept off my rear end by this classic everyone adores. <br/><br/>Casablanca is one of the movies I disliked the most. Actually I think it's my number one most disliked movie. It's not that I don't like old movies or I have a short attention span. I've seen Gone with the wind multiple times and love it. One of my favorite movies is a *1951 Indian, BLACK AND WHITE, ROMANCE* (!!!) movie, I've also seen that numerous times. Casablanca is as boring and plain as a movie can get. It's 102 minutes of nothing interesting happening AT ALL. Gone with the wind is a slow movie that needs patience to watch but lots of interesting things happen, there is a traceable story line and the characters are not plain and one-dimensional like in Casablanca. What happens in this movie? Is there anything interesting happening at all that anybody can point out to? I don't think so.<br/><br/>It's just 102 minutes of random boring people talking about random boring stuff. When I read good reviews of Casablanca I have never seen or heard anyone point out to anything interesting actually happening in this movie. Just how pretty Ingrid was, how cool Bogart was, how well done the movie is, how impeccable the acting is, silly meaningless quotes like ""here's looking at you kid"" and just that it's a ""timeless classic"". I just think this whole Casablanca thing is a gimmick and a case of ""the emperor's clothes"". There is nothing to be well acted or well done because there is nothing happening during the whole movie. I think it would be way more interesting to just film random conversations between random people in bars.<br/><br/>And the love story between the two main protagonists has to be the least believable I've ever seen. I enjoy and get emotionally moved very much by a love story, it doesn't even need to be very good. I cry when I read Hans Christian Andersen's ""The Steadfast Tin Soldier"" for eff's sake. There is absolutely zero chemistry between the two main actors. Their ""love story"" is completely artificial, superficial and there is zero emotion portrayed. They seem to be acquaintances at best, not even friends, not to mention lovers. I've seen better simulated ""attraction"" or ""love"" in porn dialogues than in Casablanca. No, forget that, I can detect more love and attraction when two butterflies dance together or I see rabbits mating. I'm not even kidding or exaggerating.<br/><br/>This movie made me feel nothing at all, absolutely nothing except boredom. It's unique in this particularity. There is no other movie I can remember that made me feel NOTHING AT ALL. Bad movies at least amuse me. Casablanca is completely devoid of any emotion. Casablanca is the cinematic equivalent of a mouthful of sand. There was no character I could empathize with in the slightest way as there were no real, humane characters to empathize with. Just artificiality. <br/><br/>I'm completely mesmerized about how can people adore this movie so much. It's boring, plain, bone-dry, story-less and features the least believable love stories I have ever seen. <br/><br/>Excuse me, I'm not a connoisseur like you Casablanca lovers, but I have common sense. And common sense tells me a movie doesn't have to be necessarily very ""entertaining"" but it needs to be ENJOYABLE, reasonably ENGAGING and just in the least to have some INTERESTING things happening. Casablanca has none of this things in the slightest. <br/><br/>Please leave aside your love for this movie, imagine for one minute you don't know who Ingrid and Bogart were and this movie was completely unknown. You've never heard a thing about this movie your entire life and you just watch it not knowing anything about it or the actors. Would you enjoy it? I guarantee you would be bored out of your mind. That is why it is not a ""TIMELESS"" classic. Here's two movies I would consider timeless classics: Papillon and The Good, The Bad and the Ugly. Not this bore fest. <br/><br/>I would give Casablanca a negative rating if I could."
"truemythmedia","10","4","5","15 August 2019"," Overlooked by Modern Americans
","I love this film. It isn't my favorite movie nor even in my top 100. It's beautiful but it isn't the sort of movie that I typically care for. It's primarily a love triangle that could essentially be straightened up by a single conversation. It's super nationalistic and earnest without a lot of the complicated characters that I tend to like.<br/><br/>Yet, somehow it is a movie I don't just like but love. It is a film that is emblematic of several things that I enjoy looking back on.<br/><br/>The first of these is the Hollywood studio system. Once it crashed in the 70s for the rise of auteurs and less polished clean films films produced in the style of Classic Hollywood went away forever. There were certainly a lot of things about Old Hollywood that needed to go: the way they controlled people, the racism, and the sexism; but there was also a sort of magical quality back when everyone was going to see the same couple of movies over and over again. A communal experience in film that is only likened to today in films such as ""Avengers: Endgame."" Here is a film that was worthy of being seen by everyone.<br/><br/>It has the polish of masters of their trades working to achieve perfect shots, perfect performances with a crispness that only fails when it is intentionally dropped to give the old soft fuzzy look to Ingrid Bergman's close ups.<br/><br/>Pointing to the film and trying to call out any one aspect of the film as special is difficult because every aspect of it is done so perfectly. Can you call out the acting and leave out the cinematography, or the direction, or the editing?<br/><br/>Another thing this film does is remind me of a time when America was busy sacrificing individual comforts, preferences, freedoms, and even lives for the sake of something larger than themselves. These days that seems in short supply. It doesn't seem outlandish to think that if they remade this film (and don't you think for a second that they wouldn't if they thought it would make money) today it would end with Rick (Humphrey Bogart, ""The Maltese Falcon"") and Ilsa (Ingrid Bergman, ""Notorious"") flying off together to a new life and romance.<br/><br/>""Casablanca"" is a great example of something I believe is quite tragic about modern movie watchers, though it is probably inevitable. It's a film that is utterly beautiful and full of meaning and entertaining yet most people won't watch it because it is old. I am a fan of old things and one of those weirdos that are always talking about the things that we are forgetting from our past.<br/><br/>There are many things about the past that we should grow beyond but ""Casablanca"" shouldn't be one of them. It may not have a crazy shootout at the end, snappy curse laced dialogue, or sizzling stars baring it all, but it has stood the test of time for a reason."

"gigan-92","10","4","5","1 February 2012"," ""It seems destiny has taken a hand.""
","This film is a monumental piece of film history. I can honestly it might just be one of the best movies of all time. If anything, you have to acknowledge the writing. Almost every single line of dialogue in the film is a household terminology to this day, most people paying tribute to the film without even knowing it. That's why I wanted to use a less popular quote for the title, and it has its own meanings within the film. Another joy of the film is composer Max Steiner; yes, Max Steiner of 1933's ""King Kong"". His music is timeless, and he captures the mystery and romance of the film perfectly.<br/><br/>It's definitely a love story at a glance, one of the best ever told if not so, but I view it more as a story of sacrifice, on the part of both lovers. The film is also a piece of history, taking place during the Second World War It entails a time when the Third Reich's immense shadow was cast over all of Europe, and the film portrays this quite nicely. However the film is about more than Charlie Chaplin poking fun at the Nazi Party (gotta love Chaplin). There is quite a bit of nicely done comedy within the weaving of it all, but it's balanced just right.<br/><br/>I'm not sure if it qualifies as a film noir exactly, but Rick (Humphrey Bogart) is cynical enough to fit the bill and the use of shadows is quite extraordinary. The setting and lighting during the best scenes of the movie are darkened rooms, making it all the more intense. As I said before, Rick, with his sarcasm and pessimism, is one of my favorite characters of all time. To me the movie is about him most of all. He sees the events taking place before him, knows he must act, but for a while chooses not to. The beauty of it all is that we know why and we feel for him.<br/><br/>All the performances are incredible. Like all golden era Hollywood flicks of the 50s, it draws our attention without the use of bloodshed and sexuality. Although don't be mistaken, it is indeed used here and very subtly I add. Its takes a film lover's eyes and ears to catch it, and the story telling is just marvelous.<br/><br/>One cannot be a true fan of cinema without having seen ""Casablanca""."
"Desertman84","10","4","5","17 January 2012"," One Of The Most Beloved Film
","One of the most beloved American films, this captivating wartime adventure of romance and intrigue from director Michael Curtiz defies standard categorization. Simply put, it is the story of Rick Blaine, a world-weary ex-freedom fighter who runs a nightclub in Casablanca during the early part of World War II.Casablanca is a romantic drama film directed by Curtiz that features Humphrey Bogart, Ingrid Bergman and Paul Henreid, and featuring Claude Rains, Conrad Veidt, Sydney Greenstreet, Peter Lorre and Dooley Wilson. <br/><br/>Set during Second World War, it focuses on a man torn between, in the words of one character, love and virtue. He must choose between his love for a woman and helping her and her Czech Resistance leader husband escape from the Vichy-controlled Moroccan city of Casablanca to continue his fight against the Nazis.Despite pressure from the local authorities, notably the crafty Capt. Renault, Rick's cafe has become a haven for refugees looking to purchase illicit letters of transit which will allow them to escape to America. One day, to Rick's great surprise, he is approached by the famed rebel Victor Laszlo and his wife, Ilsa, Rick's true love who deserted him when the Nazis invaded Paris. She still wants Victor to escape to America, but now that she's renewed her love for Rick, she wants to stay behind in Casablanca. ""You must do the thinking for both of us,"" she says to Rick. He does, and his plan brings the story to its satisfyingly logical, if not entirely happy, conclusion. <br/><br/>Despite a changing assortment of screenwriters frantically adapting an unstaged play and barely keeping ahead of production, and Bogart attempting his first romantic lead role, Casablanca won three Academy Awards, including Best Picture. Its characters, dialogue, and music have become iconic, and the film has grown in popularity to the point that it now consistently ranks near the top of lists of the greatest films of all time.An undisputed masterpiece and perhaps Hollywood's quintessential statement on love and romance, it has only improved with age, boasting career-defining performances from Bogart and Bergman. It has a peculiar magic to it, and it's in the richness of its details that mostly go unnoticed because of the film's pace.Despite of being released in 1942,the appeal of Casablanca shows no sign of diminishing as time goes by."
"ajs-10","10","4","5","3 January 2012"," A truly excellent film that lives up to it's billing 'A Classic'!...
","This is a film I've seen many times before but this is the first time I've actually sat down and 'watched' it. I must say I was surprised at just how good it was. Before, there had always been distractions, but today I watched it right through and I must say I was very impressed. It's the kind of film my parents would watch and so it never featured very high on my radar. But when I got into watching films more seriously this was always one of those that had a lot of critical acclaim and so I added it to 'The List'. It finally lands on TV and I had a chance to see it tonight Truly excellent! I will explain what I mean by that after this very brief summary.<br/><br/>At the beginning of World War II many people tried to get out of Europe and one of the preferred routes was via Casablanca to Lisbon and then on to America. Consequently there were many refugees stranded in Casablanca falling prey to corrupt officials and other less savoury characters. Bar owner Rick Blaine wants nothing to do with all this business, in fact he doesn't even like people talking politics in his place. But when certain travel documents fall into his possession he finds it hard to remain neutral. Particularly when an ex-lover, Ilsa Lund, appears on the scene with her husband Victor Laszlo. Throw in a corrupt, but charismatic, French Police official, Captain Louis Renault, a German, Major Heinrich Strasser who is bent on arresting Victor Laszlo and, of course, Rick's piano player, Sam, and you've got the makings of a really great film. I won't say any more or the Spoiler Police (Classics Division) will have me in a concentration camp (again).<br/><br/>You would have thought a film made in black and white and shot in a 4:3 aspect ratio would be really hard to watch. I'm here to tell you it's one of the easiest films to watch I've seen it quite a while. All the action is concentrated in the middle of the screen; every shot is set up that way. I guess it helps that it is based on a stage play in that respect. Performance wise, well I cannot fault anyone, but I must give special praise to both Humphrey Bogart as Rick Blaine and Ingrid Bergman as Ilsa Lund, both were truly excellent! Honourable mentions must also go to; Paul Henreid as Victor Laszlo, Claude Rains as Captain Louis Renault, Conrad Veidt as Major Heinrich Strasser, Sydney Greenstreet as Signor Ferrari and Peter Lorre as Ugarte.<br/><br/>I'm not usually all the big on love stories but in this case I will make an exception. I think it's the quality of the performances that really makes this work as well as it does. There is a lot of political intrigue in there too. If you remember that at the time it was being made America had not joined the war in Europe and so what it says politically is pretty important too. But getting away from the politics of the thing, I found this film totally engaging all the way through with characters you could believe in and a great script. I said it at the beginning and I'll say it again Truly excellent and VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.<br/><br/>My score: 9.7/10.<br/><br/>IMDb Score: 8.7/10 (based on 204,219 votes at the time of going to press).<br/><br/>Rotten Tomatoes 'Tomatometer' Score: 97/100 (based on 59 reviews counted at the time of going to press). Rotten Tomatoes 'Audience' Score: 94/100 (based on 319,465 user ratings counted at the time of going to press)."

","Claimed as one of the greatest romances of all time, Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman star in ""Casablanca"", a romance set in Nazi-occupied Africa, about the affection and heartbreak of love. The movie starts with Rick Blaine, portrayed brilliantly by Bogart, who owns a night club called ""Rick's Cafe American"", during December 1941 in the city of Casablanca. Set years after a devastating separation between he and a long-lost loved one, that particular woman, portrayed beautifully by Ingrid Bergman, who shined on screen, returns with a new husband who is on the run for the law, but she also faces serious love connections with a heartbroken Rick. Beautifully directed by Michael Curtiz, and written brilliantly by three or four separate screenwriters, ""Casablanca"" is one of the greatest movies ever made. This movie has more relative humor, strong heart, and memorable characters than the technological success of ""Citizen Kane"". These characters like Rick, Ilsa, Victor, Cpt. Louis, and Sam, are still memorable and lovable to this day. Also, there are so many memorable lines that can be spoken a thousand times, like my two favorites: ""Here's looking at you, kid!"" and ""Louis, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship"", both quoted beautifully by Humphrey Bogart. ""Casablanca"" is a more beautiful and enjoying motion picture, and it is one of the many masterpieces for all cinema lovers.

Think about it, all you have to do is to hum the first notes of 'As Time Goes By'  ta-da ta-da ta-daaa  and a whole universe resurrects in your memories, forever incarnated by these two profiles staring at each other, Humphrey Bogart in the iconic trench-coat of his career-defining role, and Ingrid Bergman, as gracious as ever.<br/><br/>One word : ""Casablanca"", and a gallery of characters revives, Sam, the piano player, these unforgettable second-billed actors who graced the silver screen in these black and white days, Conrad Veidt, Sidney Greenstreet, Peter Lorre, an international cast and so many immortal scenes, Rick Blaine's bourbon-driven melancholy while remembering the good old days with Ilsa, the patriotic fervor expressed during the singing of La Marseillaise and probably the most emotional farewell scene ever, followed by ""the beginning of a beautiful friendship"" as the ending of a beautiful movie. Of course, the list would be incomplete without the mention of Michael Curtiz' masterful direction, the dazzling shadowy cinematography and the Esptein twins' perfect script that lurched the film into Pop-Culture : ""Here's looking at you, kid"", ""We'll always have Paris"" and so many unforgettable lines that became catchphrases on their own. But still, everything would all have been secondary if it wasn't for THE element that made ""Casablanca"" such a legendary film : it's a beautiful romance.<br/><br/>60 years later, the movie still divides, should have Ilsa gone with Rick or Laszlo? The consensus is that she did the right choice, but there's no doubt that the truer love was Rick. The film perfectly captured the dilemma of a real triangular love as Ilsa's husband, Viktor Lazslo is fundamentally a good man, a heroic resistant fighter who escaped from a concentration camp, and the only man who inspired Rick Blaine a bit of admiration. As an ex-freedom fighter, Rick sure understands the value of courage and visibly, something from the past has metamorphosed his idealistic nature into the cynical and detached mask of a lone wolf figure. Who else than Humphrey Bogart could have played this role with such intensity? Intense but still profoundly romantic as the wound in Rick's heart opens when Lazslo comes back with Ilsa, Rick's former love, back then in Paris.<br/><br/>The international atmosphere of the Rick's Café nightclub gives it a unique and absolutely endearing flavor spiced up that pivotal night, when Ilsa asks Sam to play 'As Time Goes By', we understand that this song has a poignant significance, as the last one she and Rick heard as lovers, before the War came and ruined everything. Ilsa ran out of Rick who, like most of the refugees, escaped from the German invasion leaving Paris to Marseilles, then Marseilles to Oran, and from Oran to Casablanca, in French Morocco, freed from the German control, to get visas to the neutral Portugal, the only way to America. Rick exiled himself in Casablanca, as if something was unconsciously keeping him within the War, and when he delivers the legendary : ""Of all the gin joints in all the towns in all the world, she walks into mine"" is he really lamenting? When Ilsa re-enters his life, his office, Rick's bitterness made him say the wrong words, but then he painfully realizes he still loves her, and that Lazlso took her from him.<br/><br/>Lazslo and Ilsa need two 'letters of transit' to go to Lisbon, and by an ironic coincidence, Rick got those two tickets from a suave criminal named Ugarte who got them by murdering two German couriers. With the death of Ugarte, the two tickets for freedom were in Rick's hand and a great moral dilemma in his heart : contributing to the War effort and lose the love or his life, or following his motto : ""I stick my neck out for nobody"". Rick's true nature can't fool anyone, but the romance gains in complexity when Ilsa revealing to Rick why she left him, reconciles with him and realizes she loves him more than ever and can't leave him again. The romance is in a dead-end, and compromised by the antagonistic presence of the Major Heinrich Strasser who can't allow Lazzlo to escape. Strasser counts on the collaboration of Vichy's government, incarnated by Captain Renault, another character we still don't know where his heart belongs to, as he said : ""This is my least vulnerable spot"" <br/><br/>Ultimately, and I guess this is what makes the movie so inspiring, as said Roger Ebert in his brilliant commentary, all the characters aren't bad people. Even the ambiguity of Captain Renault is a nice writing touch that allows to keep uncertain the role he's going to play, although the roulette episode proved his good heart. Even Greenstreet as the head of the criminal underworld and Rick's business rival accepts to buy him out and keep all the employees, even Yvonne, the French girl who dated a Nazi officer couldn't hide her tears when the Marseillaise was sung. Finally, the heroic nature of Rick Blaine prevailed as he decided to take care of everything, fooling Ilsa, Lazzslo, and Renault, but ultimately getting them in the plane. Renault also redeemed himself by the ""Round up the usual suspects"" to clear Rick of shooting Major Strasser before he could order to cancel the flight.<br/><br/>Rick, #4 hero in the American Film Institute, explains his decision to Ilsa : ""I'm no good at being noble, but it doesn't take much to see that the problems of three little people don't amount to a hill of beans in this crazy world"". He's twice wrong. First, Rick is excellent at being noble. Secondly, now that WW2 is over but not ""Casablanca""'s legendary status, whether you love old, classic, black and white films or not, you should ask yourself if the problems of three little problems aren't finally the essence of the most beautiful acts that humanity could inspire."
"CriticalCondition","10","4","5","9 March 2011"," One of the Best Films of All Time
","Casablanca oozes pure class and style. Its a film that is easy to like. The acting is superb with Bogart playing a very cool, but wounded Rick. Also, Claude Rains as Capt. Renault was often very funny and gave the the film a lighthearted feel in between the more serious moments.<br/><br/>The director, Michael Curtiz did an excellent job creating a very subtle, oppressed feel to the characters on screen with the constant spotlight which can be felt in many of the scenes. Also, there was great use in lighting to foreshadow the intentions of many of the characters.<br/><br/>All around Casablanca has a great story, funny/touching moments and a definitive style. I would highly recommend this movie."
"Soph55","10","4","5","3 March 2011"," Casablanca
","This movie was excellent, I really liked the comedy in all of the seriousness. I thought despite all of the politics and revolt, that this was a beautiful story of love, and struggle. The relationships between all of the characters was amazing, the way they all just seemed to belong together in this time and place, in these situations. though all of the characters work to pull the wool over each others eyes and keep out of view of the Germans, in the end one large scheme pulls everyone together and allows everyone to end up where they belong. Through Ricks many connections in Casablanca he is able to run a money making business that also acts as a safe house for exchange of things not so legal at this time, and brings him a part of his past he would of much rather lived without ever remembering again...Ilsa. In the end nothing is really what it seems..."

","For the Allies, 1943 was perhaps the grimmest and most desperate year of the war, as the conflict threatened to grind on into stalemate. Back on the home front, movie production was responding appropriately, cutting back on the flag-waving calls-to-arms, and making pictures that were more about hope, endurance, and getting on with life during a state of war. This is where Casablanca fits in.<br/><br/>Everybody knows about Casablanca – even people who think they don't will probably be tacitly aware of its many quotable lines. Why has the picture become such a cultural monument? The reasons are many, but that quotable script is as good a place to start as any. Casablanca is based on a (then un-produced) play by Murray Bennet and Joan Alison, which provided the outline. However it was given its Hollywood makeover by celebrated screen writing twins Julius and Philip Epstein, whose best picture up to this point had probably been The Strawberry Blonde (1941) with James Cagney; a witty, rather sentimental and very musical period piece. The Epsteins have brought many similar touches to this picture, especially their approach to music and comedy. Many of the key moments have a musical underpinning; not just the recurring love theme ""As Time Goes By"", but the playing of the Marseilles to drown out the Nazis, or the ""Knock on Wood"" number which is played in the first scene at Rick's, and very much establishes the atmosphere of the joint. The Epstein brand of humour doesn't rely on a handful of ridiculous and exaggerated characters, as was the usual at this time. Instead, the jokes all arise from normal things that we might laugh at in real life, such as the market trader reducing the price when he realises Ingrid Bergman is ""a special friend of Rick's"". This sort of thing is crucial for Casablanca, because it allows a little touch of humour without robbing the story of its dignity or credibility.<br/><br/>Then there is the director Michael Curtiz, a man who has not been deified by the magic wand of the auteur theory, and yet one whom any serious film scholar is forced to pay attention to simply because of the number of important pictures he helmed. Despite this being his best-known picture, he is himself better known for the series of swashbucklers he made with Errol Flynn in the mid-to-late 1930s. It is true that Curtiz's style tended to be very technical, and certainly his most noticeable work has been in the action genre, so as such his having directed Casablanca is seen as being coincidental to its success. Still, his shrewd mechanical mind has added a thing or two to this picture. Take that opening shot of the city, panning down from the mosque tower into the busy street. It's a complex, cluttered shot, but it really gives us a feel for the location and that tense atmosphere, with great touches like those two extras bickering in the foreground. A lot of Curtiz pictures begin with a shot like this – crowd scenes that look completely random and extremely realistic, and yet are full of meaning and rich in detail. Curtiz was also not quite the mean-minded movie-making machine that he is sometimes painted as. He did have a feel for romance and sentiment if it was a picture that relied upon it. Casablanca features quite a few uncomplicated close-ups of characters in emotional intensity, just about the only uncluttered shots you get in a Curtiz movie, and they are incredibly moving.<br/><br/>But of course, what would these close-ups be if they weren't of great actors? Casablanca has a flawless cast, but also a very bold one at the time. Humphrey Bogart was only just starting to play leading roles, and even then he was generally an anti-hero. However, Casablanca solidified his screen-persona, a tough individualist on the outside, but a good man at heart, albeit one loathe to reveal it. By showing that there was a human side to his charismatic demeanour, he gave his best performance to that point. Bergman too was just on the cusp of stardom, but she pulls off a role of frailty and tearfulness without getting hysterical, as many a lesser actress would have done. And then there is Claude Rains, one of the few long-established players in the picture. Rains is playing his usual type – perhaps his archetypal role – and it is actually one not unlike Bogart's, with the crucial difference being that Rains revels in his amorality. And yet Rains's art is that he makes this character, who is utterly despicable on paper, likable on screen.<br/><br/>On that note, it's tempting to view Bogart and Rains as the two leads – not Bogart and Bergman. It is Bogart and Rains whose story arcs deal with the main theme of Casablanca – whether to strive for individual gain or to fight for the good of the people. And this is after all a movie about people, and hope in the unity of people. There is this feeling of people brought together by their desperate situation, which permeates Rick's and the picture in general, and it's something writers, director and cast have all contributed to. It makes us feel that the struggles of every minor player – Peter Lorre's nervous underground agent, Joy Page's young wife desperate to escape the city, S.Z. Sakall's jovial headwaiter, the sadly-unsung Dooley Wilson – are as important and immediate as those of the lead players. It is perhaps more than anything else this rich humanity that made the picture connect with wartime audiences, and has made it a work of power and resonance ever since."
"awilkinson05","10","4","5","14 February 2010"," ""As Time Goes By...""
","As the film's theme song so aptly observes, things change as time goes by. People, politics, relationships- none of these are safe from the passage of time. This is never truer than in the fictional story that takes place in one Moroccan city of a 1942 masterpiece. In Casablanca, this concept is exemplified expertly in a timeless classic directed by Michael Curtiz.<br/><br/>The story centers on the reunion of two ex-lovers and how their past relationship fits into their present circumstances. In the city of Casablanca, Rick (Humphrey Bogart) is living his life lightly and superficially, making no personal connections to anyone, as is fittingly demonstrated by a character-defining line in the beginning of the movie 'I stick my neck out for nobody'. He's seemingly satisfied with this unfulfilling existence when a ghost from his past (Ingrid Bergman) walks back into his life (and into his bar) with her new prestigious husband, Victor Laszlo. Rick is surprised and unhinged at her sudden presence, and Ilsa obviously is as well. The couple is there to escape the World War II Nazi Germany, but cannot leave without Rick's help. Old feelings must be faced, and life altering choices made before anyone can enjoy a happily ever after.<br/><br/>The title this movie has earned as one of the greatest of all time is not earned easily, nor given lightly. Greatness is found in the dialogue, acting, camera shots, etc. My personal favorite aspect is the dialogue. The film is surprisingly funny, in all the back-and-forth lines delivered with a perfect dose of dry humor, such as Rick's response to his file ('Are my eyes really brown?"") and Renault's feigned outrage (""I am shocked, shocked to find that gambling is going on here""). The peppering of these well-delivered lines throughout the film really makes the movie for me. The writing is terrific, and almost every line is memorable. I also admire the depth of each character. Rick at first appears to be a cool, selfish bar owner, but we see that he is actually just a broken-hearted man, and 'a rank sentimentalist'. Ilsa as a character is layered and mysterious. She is conflicted- neither the audience, nor the woman herself, can tell which man she loves most. We never know through what she tells us, rather the answer is gleaned from significant looks and body language.<br/><br/>That especially is an excellent facet of Casablanca- the subtlety. Much of the plot is derived from facial expressions and what is found behind a character's words or actions rather than their face value appearance. For example, Ugarte hints to Rick that he killed the German couriers in order to obtain the transit letter. In response to Ugarte's earlier question, Rick says ""You're right, Ugarte. I am a little more impressed with you"" -his tone of disgust in this line is slight, but significant. Or at the conclusion of the film, Ilsa is to board a plane with one of the men. It turns out to be Victor. She never says which man she wants it to be, but as she walks away she turns her head to look at Rick one last time and we can clearly see the answer. These moments and many like them exhibit the unassuming skill of the film.<br/><br/>I have only just touched on a few of the many great merits of Casablanca. It is a fantastic film, and I understand why it has earned so many raving reviews over the years. It's now one of my favorites and I know it's one I will watch again and again. The movie appeals to a broad audience- from film experts to average movie watchers, it is accessible and enjoyable. This appeal extends across generations, as it has survived all these years and will for many more to come. Maybe some things don't change. <br/><br/>As time goes by, indeed."
"kenjha","10","4","5","17 January 2010"," You Must Remember This
","It doesn't get much better than this drama about war time intrigue and romance. Bogart gives the best performance of his storied career in the quintessential role of the tough, cynical loner with a soft heart. Bergman is simply luminous. Henried does well in a thankless role. Rains nearly steals the film as a crooked but lovable police inspector. The script has more memorable lines than any other, the cinematography is crisp, and nobody sings ""As Time Goes By"" like Wilson. Curtiz, an underrated director, deserves much of the credit for the iconic images of this unforgettable classic. Thankfully, to paraphrase a line from the film, we'll always have ""Casablanca."""
"secondtake","10","4","5","17 October 2009"," The writing, the character actors, the lighting, and then, for dessert, some romance, too. Oh, and America goes to war at last.
","Casablanca (1942)<br/><br/>When Rick (the inimitable Bogart) says to Sam (the inimitable Dooley Wilson), ""If it's December 1941 in Casablanca, what time is it in New York?"" he's announcing to everyone that this is a movie about Pearl Harbor. That is, it is about this hardboiled, pre-noir American type, who sticks his neck out for no one, and his growing need to go to war.<br/><br/>Need and desire. That's part of the compelling mood of the movie--everything feels like it has to be so. Americans are (by implication) really good at heart, and of course we'll come to the air of pretty Norwegians trapped by love and reluctant Frenchmen trapped by circumstance and all those very interesting lovable refugees (some real refugee actors), trapped by Nazi meanness and brutality, plain and simple.<br/><br/>The romance? That, in a way, is the MacGuffin, not the other way around. Certainly, the famous end to the movie leaves the romance in the dust. Casablanca is a call to arms, for all the best reasons, and it appeals across the decades, too. In fact, the movie premiered on Thanksgiving, 1942, so the U.S. is fully in the war by the time people see it. And it resonates as a confirmation, and almost as prescient. We trust Bogart, by now, to be the right kind of man in every circumstance, just like our own men, husbands, fathers, brothers on the field.<br/><br/>These great things don't make the movie great. Not as a movie. The writing, above all, does that (the Epsteins labored and were as inspired as they were gifted in this, with Howard Koch). But the filming is gorgeous, every scene filled with dense layers foreground to back, including layers of light, and often moving light, from searchlights and passing cars, or in the café as the lights move from piano to band and so on. Actors move across the screen in fluid conversation, sometimes for a laugh, often for a drink, eventually to see Rick, or to fret about getting out, getting to Lisbon, getting to America. It's all idealized and frightening at the same time. The bit actors are astonishing, the direction by the seasoned but unexceptional Curtiz is compact and elegant. Bogart is perfect. <br/><br/>There isn't much to say new, or old, that's worth the time here, with everything out there so well said already. Just Google the movie and read away. Or better yet, watch it again. If you think you've seen the movie enough, look beyond plot and really listen to the writing, and watch the camera-work and lights. It's not a great film by accident, and it doesn't hide why it's great. There are better films, I suppose, of course there are, depending who you ask and on what day. But not many."

","I don't know that I can do the 10 lines of text for this. I mean, what can I say that won't be a repetition? This is the yardstick by which all movies are measured. It also contains one of the biggest misnomers of all time. NOBODY says ""Play it again, Sam"" during this movie. How many bar bets have I won with that one? (Lots) It also goes to show (to paraphrase another classic) 'you never know what you're gonna get'. This was a ""B"" movie completed in a very short time. And we wind up with a timeless classic. Personal note: IMHO, and not to detract from a wonderful ensemble cast, Claude Rains steals the show. A sign of a truly great film is one you pick up in the middle, no matter how often you have seen it, and you just can't turn it off."
"cordaro9418","10","4","5","1 June 2009"," ""... human life is cheap.""
","Where to begin..? Originally believed a 'B' film in their product, Warner Bros. never conceived the effect the movie would have. Shot in sequence due to a script written daily, the actors never knew what to expect from the characters day after day. The fact that not even the writers knew who would win the girl till the night before the classic scene was shot. And yet 'Casablanca' is listed at No. 2 on the AFI top 100 films of all time (though should, in all actuality, be flip-flopped with 'Citizen Kane' for the top spot). With success in 'High Sierra' and 'The Maltese Falcon' (Thanks in large part to a rather ignorant George Raft) Bogart was well on his way to being a legitimate leading man. This film would make him a legend a studio star and later, a legend. Sure his body of work was the main factor, but 'Casablanca' in hand with 'Falcon' created the mystique of Bogart which films like 'To Have and Have Not' and 'The Big Sleep' only fueled. A mediocre effort from Warners which molded many of their castaway Euro-stars into a great and well written tapestry where everyone stole the scene from everyone else in such fashion it appeared seamless. The film moves along introducing us to each character in perfect detail, the harsh environment of Casablanca, that war-torn sweat-box which could easily double as a Tatooine spaceport from 'Star Wars', and the Nazi imperial rule who smothers them all. Never looked upon as epic and not even filmed as such 'Casablanca' exudes Epic film in a nice tidy package. With all around fantastic effort from everyone on screen with a great turn by Claude Raines the film is a must see and worthy of No. 2 on the list (sandwiched between 'Kane' and 'The Godfather'). Quickly paced and keeping you in your seat, get the popcorn and don't even think of going to the bathroom."
"DKosty123","10","4","5","27 August 2006"," Classic
","There is no term to describe this other than classic, but not the type of classic that a film like THE WIZARD OF OZ or GONE WITH THE WIND are. That is because when this film was being made, it was just another assembly line production from it's studio (Warner). When you see it today, the cast appears so great that you would think it was something special, but this supporting cast, great as it is, worked together often. What this has in common with the WIZARD is a great script.<br/><br/>The writers of CASABLANCA came up with a script that tops all other films in classic moments of quotes that have become a part of Americana. So many quotes from this film are used in other films & media that they have become cliché almost. Even miss-quotes like ""Play It Again, Sam"" from this film have become American folk-lore. ""Round up the Usual Suspects"" has become it's own film later. ""You & Me, Kid""- the list goes on & on.Other than the Great Oz, these quotes just flow from this film to 100's of other works since this film was made.<br/><br/>What makes this film really special is the unfulfilled love between Bogart & Bergman's character that is left hanging at the end. In an era, where love always had to have a happy ending, this movie gloriously leaves us with people in love who are forced away from each other by circumstances beyond either of their control. <br/><br/>This theme is closer to real life than most Hollywood products of any era. Almost everybody can identify with it because haven't we all had a love in our life who we yearned for very much, but due to circumstances beyond us, we never had a chance to fulfill? That is too me what makes this film stand above all others.<br/><br/>This is a film that has action, but not much of it. This film has comedy, but only enough to make the film great. It has subtle patriotic themes that carry the film along. Most importantly, this film has the heart of every viewer who ever watches it because the film, by accident, touches themes that many films aspire to reach, but never achieve. <br/><br/>Ironically, this all happened by the greatest of chance & rarely has any movie ever come close to what this film is. If I were a filmmaker, actor, or had a career in this industry, this would be the film I wish I had worked on. Nothing gets better than this one."
"caa821","10","4","5","26 August 2006"," It's simply ---- GREAT
","This movie can only be described as GREAT - and it gets even better with the passage of time and the more you see it. The tone of the story, and the presentation of the legendary Bogart persona, and his most famous characterization, Rick, the American ex-patriot owner of the famous Casablanca night club, is completely exemplified in two early scenes. The essence of ""cool"" and ""authoritative,"" Rick is in the private area of his establishment. Sitting alone at a chess board, he nods to his large guardian (in Mideastern attire and fez) at the entry door as to whether persons seeking entry are to be permitted or not. One man, tall and pompous, a key official (perhaps the head) of Deutsche Bank, gets a ""no"" nod from Rick. As he protests, Rick joins the guard at the door, and indicates the man must limit his patronage to the bar. As the man, protesting still, hands Rick his card, Rick rips it and tosses the pieces aside. <br/><br/>The arrogant big-shot shouts, ""What!? Do you know who I am!?"" Rick,/Bogie replies with his unique look and tone, ""I do; you're lucky the bar's open to you!!""<br/><br/>Next, Peter Lorre, as the smarmy, little, shady character, Ugarte, sits down at Rick's table. He has the ""Letters of Transit"" which he later gives to Rick for keeping, and which comprise a key element to this story. <br/><br/>But before this, conversing, he says to Rick, in his quiet nasal voice, ""You despise me, don't you?"" To which Bogie replies, ""Oh, if I gave you any thought, I probably would.""<br/><br/>It would be worth watching the entire film if only those two brief exchanges were all there was to enjoy. But they are only a preliminary to a picture and story which have offered everything one could desire, but even more as time passes. The drama, the depiction of the mood of the time and feeling of WW II, and sensational performances from the four principals - Bogart, Bergman, Rains and Henreid - and Lorre, Greenstreet, Wilson, Veidt, and the remainder of the supporting cast, all provide one of the most entertaining couple of hours you can find, regardless of medium or period presented.<br/><br/>Regarding this turbulent time during the maturation of WW II in Europe and northern Africa - as an historical, nostalgic representation of that part of our history, and this film's representation of the best of Hollywood's craft during that era - it provides us more to appreciate today than it did when produced, or when it may have been viewed during years past, and closer to the time period of the story.<br/><br/>If someone were to place a gun to my head and demand a criticism of any aspect of this film, the only thing I could cite would be the thought that Henreid's Victor character show perhaps a bit more energy and charisma. Henreid was one of Hollywood's most suave, virile, ""continental"" characters, and the man who was already noted for his lighting two cigarettes simultaneously, for Bette Davis and him in ""Now Voyager."" In ""Casablanca"" we are given to assume that the fate of the free world may hinge on his patriotic, underground leadership, and that the Nazis must fear his abilities more than Eisenhower's or Montgomery's. Granted he would have been low-key in not wanting to stir-up the authorities while seeking to leave - but Paul seemed to ""lower the key"" a bit more than he might have in his performance. However, this is minor, and in no way diminishes this film's greatness."
"jbirtel","10","4","5","18 August 2003"," Time Hasn't Gone By This Classic!
","I saw this movie in college 20 years ago with over seventy 18-23 year old fellow students. And the audience reaction was like the movie just came out yesterday. Here's a movie that assumes that the average audience has intelligence. And the tons of laughs were all in the right places for the right reasons. Twenty years later, I can still hear the laughter and applause...and the cheers; especially for that now classic closing line.<br/><br/>If more black and white classics were given this kind of DVD treatment (the recent 2 disc release), then I'd own more black and white classics. Bogart's brilliant portrayal was ahead of its time and no one else but Bergman could of been Elsa. Same for Rains, Henreid, Sakall, Veidt and EVERYONE else. Perfect cast, perfect acting.<br/><br/>It's a shame most people will never see this with an audience because this is a crowd pleaser if ever there was one. So the next best thing is the quality and care that was put into the new DVD. Believe it or not, this makes a great ""at home"" date flick. And even have a few friends over...but not the 'chatty' ones. There's just too much to miss if so and so starts to ""yackitty! yackitty! yackitty! during the many (& there are many) priceless and subtle moments. This movie deserves full attention. And the nice thing is...you pick up more the 2nd time seeing it (& 3rd, 4th...etc).<br/><br/>My favorite line (no way am I repeating it or any others) is Rick's ""poor salesmanship"" rejection. This one film has more great 'one liners' than some hundred movies put together. And it still seems as fresh today as when...well; when I saw it the 1st time.<br/><br/>It's not that ""they don't make em like this anymore"" applies to 'Casablanca' because most movies, for every year, in every era (since the 1920's); aren't very good. It's always the very few that rise above the heap, every year; especially when you take into account that over 100 movies are made every year. But 'Casablanca' represents a sample of damn fine storytelling for that particular era that time has proved to be...timeless.<br/><br/>A 'must see' for most movie lovers (but not the 'yackitty' ones).<br/><br/>10 out of 10!<br/><br/>(Can't wait for Bogart's ""Treasure of the Sierra Madre""s 2 disc DVD release next month. Another sample of just how brilliant Bogart's acting is.)"
"FilmFanatic09","10","11","19","5 December 2006"," Casablanca
","No film captures the classical Hollywood style quite so well as ""Casablanca."" The film seamlessly combines romance and intrigue in its exotic location, remarkably conveyed by mere studio sets. The black and white cinematography is perfect for capturing and adding mood to the smoke filled rooms, war torn city streets, and foggy airports that compose the world of this film. Despite seeming a product of its time, ""Casablanca"" is truly a timeless piece of entertainment. It would be futile to recount the plot here. Even those who have never seen the film are likely to be aware that ""Casablanca"" is the film where Ingrid Bergman is forced to chose between old lover Humphrey Bogart and her resistance leader husband (the often overlooked Paul Henreid). Bergman as Ilsa Lund, the center of the love triangle, is magnificent here. She communicates with such ease the very different types of love she feels for each man in her life, and we sympathize with her struggle. Of course, Bogart too created a legendary performance as café owner Rick Blaine. Seeing him transform from the man who will stick his neck out for nobody to someone content with making a great self-sacrifice is one of the joys of the film. <br/><br/>Bogart and Bergman are leading players among equals however, and are rightly matched by numerous character actors, not the least of which is Claude Rains. In his portrayal of French Vichy officer Captain Renault, he hits the perfect notes to show off both the corrupt and goodhearted sides of the character. He also gets to deliver some of the film's best comedic one-liners. Another unforgettable actor is Dooley Wilson as the congenial piano player Sam, who of course provides the quintessential rendition of ""As Time Goes By"". Director Michael Curtiz certainly does these fine actors justice. The film has some striking visuals too. Be on the lookout for the raindrops on a letter which look more like tears, and the symbolism provided by a bottle of water towards the film's end. Viewers aware of the many troubles that plagued the production of ""Casablanca,"" should be amazed at the manner in which the film as a whole is able to so greatly transcend the sum of its parts. <br/><br/>When you pause and really consider it, ""Casablanca"" is a much simpler film than many others also hailed as classics. It was based on an unremarkable (and unproduced) stage play, shot on a modest budget, and released with the thought of the natural appeal it would carry for its wartime audiences. And yet it has endured so long beyond that. Much has been made on the subject of reading ""Casablanca"" as a political allegory, with Rick representing isolationist America, Lazlo the Free French, so on, and so on. This rightfully compels the film student in me. But in all actuality, the romantic in me is much more captivated by the story of three little people caught up in the problems of a crazy world. The nuances of the characters, the sense of urgency ominously hanging over every scene, and the tear jerking story of love lost, found, and lost once more in the name of a bigger cause are the elements that stay with us. For me, as well as countless other film lovers around the world, the first viewing of ""Casablanca"" proves to be the start of a very beautiful friendship."

","I tried so hard to like this movie.  I understand - it's a classic, and anyone who loves movies should swear by this film because it's this and that and the other and it can cure warts and remove cellulite and fix your car... An hour into it, my date and I were so lost that we turned it off.  The acting was great, of a caliber we don't see much of in modern movies, but the storyline just didn't sit with me.  I had no idea what was going on half the time (the legal aspects, for instance) because I don't have an intimate knowledge of the time period or location, and when I did understand what was happening (the affair), I wasn't sure why this movie had become classic.

","""This is a beginning of a beautiful friendship"" – that is how this unforgettable and everlasting movie, which talks about love, friendship, loyalty, intrigue, and survival ends. The play takes place in the city of Casablanca, and even though we are unable to see the city (because the action takes place mainly in Ricks' bar), the life of the city is present. On one side are refugees waiting to escape from the horrors of war, and on the other are those who still enjoy nights full of gambling and entertainment, or smuggling and enrichment. The love story is started in war Paris, and revived through the memories in the currently more peaceful Morocco. The fact that love is stronger and larger than any other living thing, and subordinate to world events, is show in the decisions Rick (H. Bogart) makes. Although the movie is black-and-white, it even more emphasizes time events. There is also a color version of the film, but it feels like something is missing. If you have a chance to watch it, you shouldn't miss this masterpiece. And if you have watched it... Play It Again Sam."

","I watched Casablanca for a class, and, while I initially thought that I wouldn't care for it, I find myself being able to confidently say that it's actually one of my favorite movies, not just from the class but also in general. In terms of acting character and plot the movie is just superb, the best performance being, obviously, from Humphrey Bogart. Technically, the movie is one of the best that I've seen from that period of time. The camera is EXTREMELY mobile, especially in Rick's Café, moving between the tables and sweeping the expanse of the dining room. The sweeps of the streets were incredible, and the shots seemed to be getting longer, which was nice to see. The most notable thing, technically, was the sweep of the airport as Ilsa and Laszlo's plane takes off. Overall an amazing movie, something I would definitely recommend both for the storyline and for the technical elements."

The dialog was perfect, the characters sucked you in so much that at times I forgot it was just a movie. I also may have been the only person who was thoroughly happy with the unusual ending that in my eyes wasn't predictable. That's the most I can say without giving it away. It had an array of comical and lovable characters that I couldn't help finding myself wishing that they'd have a happy ending. Especially Sam, the piano player, although he barely said two words throughout the film his charisma and cheerfulness in an otherwise very depressed time made him so lovable as a character.

","Casablanca is deemed by many to be the biggest picture ever made and one of most famous movies of all time . It's a masterpiece produced in 1942 that was thought as a run-of-the-mill studio production . It was only afterwards which it became clear that it would be a landmark cinema . Humphrey Bogart's forty ninth film , would transform the studio contract player into a superstar and to be the first in a whole string of Warner Brothers's classics in which he would play the leading role . Producer Jack Warner assigned the Rick's role for George Raft , however Hall B. Wallis wanted to Bogart who luckily obtained the important character , but he previously played only mobster roles and afterwards romantic protagonists , besides tough main lead. It's an extremely romantic film converted in cinema history with images (Rick and Ilsa embraced) , moving scenes (final farewell in the airport) and dialogs have been used or imitated in other films, spots and television programmes .<br/><br/>Casablanca is homaged with fascination as in ¨One from the heart¨ (by Francis Ford Coppola) or from irony as ¨Play it again Sam¨(Herbert Ross). The movie has immortal images with memorable quotes and the best scenes ever written , such as the exciting final when Bogart bids Bergman farewell at the airport with ¨Here's looking at you kid¨still has audiences choking back a tear. All film originates unforgotten characters as makes with Wilson, the piano player to whom Ingrid Bergman says : ¨play it Sam¨. Bergman is enticing and wonderful , stunningly photographed by Arthur Edeson , she was fortunate to have Orry Kelly an hugely talented designer costume to dress her. His shone as radiantly as Bergman's luminous beauty who never looked lovelier. Along with a fabulous plethora of secondaries such as : Claude Rains , Paul Henreid , Conrad Veidt , Peter Lorre , S.Z.Sakal, Madeleine Lebeau , John Qualen , Dooley Wilson , among others . And a large number of extras , as in the famous scene where the ""Marseillaise"" is sung over the German song ""Watch on the Rhine"", many of them had real tears in their eyes ; they were actual refugees and Jews who had escaped from Nazi persecution in Germany and elsewhere in Europe and were overcome by the emotions the scene brought out . The motion picture with sensitive score by Max Steiner was very well directed by Michael Curtiz . Well worth seeing for everybody and specially to the classic cinema lovers."

","Everyone remembers 'As Time Goes By' (the song that only stayed in the film, so popular culture has it, because Bergman had cut her hair for 'Joan of Arc', and couldn't retake scenes using another tune) but there is much more to this world-weary romance.<br/><br/>Bogart, of course, was hardly the usual romantic movie hero.  Which is possibly what makes him so perfect for Rick, in his Casablanca nightspot, on nobody's side.  He spars with Claude Rains (the crooked police captain) and Sidney Greenstreet (a rival bar owner) like a trooper, has a quiet contempt for Paul Henreid (a freedom fighter) and Peter Lorre (a thief), gives Conrad Veidt (the Nazi Major) as good as he gets, is on the level with employees Dooley Wilson and Cuddles Sakall.<br/><br/>Through all this, truly loves Ingrid Bergman (the beautiful Ilse, the love of his life).  It is their story, but not the story you might expect.  This is the secret, I think, of 'Casablanca' and its lasting success.  From the moment we see the map and the film title to the 'beautiful friendship' line at the end, we're hooked.   Every performance is a lasting joy."

Paul Henreid and wife Ingrid Bergman are among the many who have made the odyssey.  However, trouble springs up when they must go through Bergman's old flame (Humphrey Bogart, Oscar-nominated).

"jotix100","10","9","15","27 June 2004"," Casablanca gets better and better as time goes by!
","Saw this classic in DVD format the other night. I must confess that it looks just as good as I remembered it. Michael Curtiz's film is a curious one. It enjoys presently perhaps more popularity than when it originally made its debut in 1942. As new generations discovered the picture, they made it a timeless film, and generations to come will also be charmed by it.<br/><br/>The story of Rick and Ilsa and their impossible love affair will be something to be treasured by film lovers forever. Casablanca in the 40s was a hot bed of intrigue; lots of people tried to get there, but perhaps leaving the place was harder because the red tape of that era and the fact that the Nazis had a way to spoil a party. <br/><br/>In a lot of ways, this is a dated film. By today standards it would be politically incorrect. But ultimately, we all fall under the spell that Michael Curtiz created and for almost two hours we are in Casablanca among the spies and would be travelers eavesdropping into their conversations and the different schemes going on.<br/><br/>Humphrey Bogart was an actor without the looks of some of the handsome male stars of that era, yet, he is mesmerizing as Rick Blaine. It would be hard to imagine another actor playing Rick other that Bogart. Ingrid Bergman was at the height of her career when she made the film. Her chemistry with her co star is one of the best things going, since they made it believable.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast is flawless. Paul Henreid, as Victor Lazlo, cuts quite a figure and it is hard to think Ilsa would prefer Rick to this suave and sophisticated man. Claude Rains is good as Capt. Renault. Conrad Veidt, Sydney Greenstreet, Peter Lorre, S.K. Sakall, and above all Dooley Wilson, as Sam, made a magnificent contribution to the film in small roles.<br/><br/>Casablanca gets better and better, as time goes by."
"nycritic","10","6","9","16 June 2007"," Just Perfect.
","It has to be a crowning achievement for a movie to have entered into public consciousness to such a point that even when the average person may not even have a passing idea as to what this remarkable movie might be about, they assume, from the title, from the poster, that it has to be ""one of those unforgettable love affairs between Ingrid Bergman and Humphrey Bogart"". Of course, the more you do know about CASABLANCA the clearer the in-jokes and the subtle yet potent lines become: as a matter of fact, CASABLANCA has now become one of the most quoted pictures of the last one hundred years. With a convoluted story which is really a romantic love affair between Rick, Ilsa, and her husband Victor Lazlo as well as a denouncement of the Nazis in this otherwise relatively safe haven that is Rick's cafe in Casablanca, Morocco, CASABLANCA becomes a ferociously sophisticated tale that has overtones of film-noir and that overwhelming chemistry that both Bogart and Bergman possess, their romance surpassing everything else and being the barometer for which romantic drama has been measured up against. If anything, of the supporting cast, Paul Henreid, for all his third billing, is the more thankless since he doesn't get much to do other than play the somewhat befuddled Lazlo (although he does get to find out that Rick and Ilsa have a little more than common than they'd like to admit). Sydney Greenstreet, Peter Lorre (who also appeared with Bogart in THE MALTESE FALCON), Conrad Veidt also appear here as well as Claude Rains who has one of the most memorable supporting parts as the general who is ""shocked! shocked!"" that any gambling is taking place at Rick's... as he smoothly takes his winnings from an employee. Also featuring one of the most deeply, lush ballads, ""As Time Goes By"" and that powerful scene of defiance as the occupants sing for France, CASABLANCA has become an emblem more than just another feature film -- the stuff that dreams are made of."

","When people ask me what is the best movie of all-time is I don't flinch, I just say ""Casablanca"". It has everything a great movie should have: romance, sacrifice, wonderful lines, a memorable song, incredible acting (even in the smallest roles) and it is one of the few non-film noir movies filmed in the B&W era that I wouldn't want to see refilmed in color (that is in definite contrast to ""I Know Where I'm Going!"" which begs to be refilmed to show the beauty of its vistas). But the key that makes everything works is the ending. I don't think the ending that exists in Casablanca could be filmed today and though most have seen this movie (or any of its parodies) I don't want to give anything away. But I encourage you to compare the ending of this movie with the endings of other romantic movies such as ""An Affair to Remember"", ""Sleepless in Seattle"" and even the most recent animated ""Sinbad"" movie. Contrast their endings with Casablanca's ending and you see how Casablanca resonates. Many movies have tried to emulate the ending of Casablanca but it never quite rings true because hollywood movies aren't allowed to have this ending yet the only ones who try are either independent or anti-hollywood."

","Casablanca (1942), pretty close to perfection. A movie that brings out the best script from both heart n brain, a tough combination. Does a perfect job in blending the political scenario of that time (World War 2) and the ever pervasive love matters. Just 102 minutes movie but each second is entertaining. The clever-stylish dialogues keep it alive throughout. The chemistry between Bogart and Bergman from their very 1st shot together, looks very natural. I wonder why they don't make such well developed movies today. Before watching the movie I did some other viewer comments saying it is all so boring but one thing they might be missing is that these were the movies from which directors used stuff again and again and that is why they look boring to us.

","With the Nazis having already occupied France and conquered much of Eastern Europe, a stream of refugees desperately attempt to get to America by embarking on a tortuous path which includes getting to the small city of Casablanca in French Morocco and from there to Lisbon. However, as difficult as it is for these refugees to actually get to Casablanca, their travel is further complicated by the fact that nobody is allowed to take the daily flight from there to Lisbon without the written permission of the corrupt Vichy French police commander by the name of ""Captain Louis Renault"" (Claude Rains). So quite often these refugees have to wait for quite a long time and this-in and of itself-creates even more of a financial and logistical hardship upon them. So in an effort to find a solution to their problem or temporarily forget about their troubles, many of them flock to the most popular nightclub there known as ""Rick's Café Americain"" which is owned by a tough and worldly American expatriot named ""Rick Blaine"" (Humphrey Bogart). Yet, even though he is quite successful in Casablanca, he finds it hard to find any great happiness due to a previous romance which devastated him a year and a half earlier. However, things take a sudden turn for the worse when a famous anti-German activist named ""Victor Laszlo"" (Paul Henreid) walks into his nightclub-and with him is the woman who broke his heart that bleak and rainy day in Paris. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this is not only my favorite movie of all time but is also considered to be one of the best films ever made with a number of movie stars possibly turning in the best performances of their careers. I especially liked the chemistry between Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman (as ""Ilsa Lund"") along with the performance of Dooley Wilson as Rick's loyal companion ""Sam"". Be that as it may, I believe that this is one of the very few films that each and every viewer ought to see at least once and for that reason I have rated it accordingly.

","Famed critic, Roger Ebert once held a mini debate about this 1942 classic, Casablanca. He compared this movie to a similar film, Citizen Kane. He claimed that Kane may be the better movie, but Casablanca is the more popular movie. I agree with Roger because Casablanca is one of the best movies ever made and it seems as if my opinion is a fact (although keep in mind all movies are subjective). There is just so much to admire about the film. The cast, the themes, the actual production of the movie, and the way the film influenced future movies just to name a few. We wouldn't get star-studded romantic epics like 1997's Titanic if this film bombed at the box office or was not even made. Fortunately, this movie was a giant success both financially and critically. It was nominated for ten Academy Awards, winning three of them including Best Picture which it is rightfully deserved. <br/><br/>Where to begin gushing about the movie! I loved the themes of the movie. On the surface, this is a story about long-lost love. The movie is not just about love though. It is mainly about redemption. Major characters and minor characters receive their redemption. The one guy who receives his redemption the most and most often considered a hero is the main character, Rick Blaine played masterfully by Humphrey Bogart. Blaine believed he was abandoned by a woman, but she comes back into his life stirring up old feelings as he realized she always loved him. The movie could have taken the easy way out and have the two lovers back together forever, but instead Rick goes for the moral cause of beating the Nazis instead of acting on his feelings. That for me, is what made this movie so emotionally impactful and way ahead of its time. This is an incredibly thematic movie and the themes are always up for interpretation each time. <br/><br/>During World War 2, anybody fleeing the scourge of the Nazis to the United States had to travel to Morocco where they needed to pick up exit visas. The place to go is a nightclub owned by Rick Blaine (Humphrey Bogart) who happens to be a very cynical man. Blaine receives an enormous amount of pressure, but his club is still a safe haven for those searching for these exit visas. One day, his former lover Ilsa Kund (Ingrid Bergman) and her French Resistance husband, Victor Laszlo (Paul Henreid) shows up. The captain of the police, Captain Renault (Claude Rains) informs Rick that he has been ordered by Nazi officer Major Heinrich Strasser (Conrad Veidt) to keep Laszlo in Casablanca. However, Laszlo will do all it takes to escape from the Nazis. <br/><br/>One of the appeals to the movie is the A-cast. Bogart, Bergman, and Henreid were all stars at the time. They all happen to be magnificent actors, and each one of these actors might have given their best career performance. Apparently, this is Bogart's first lead role in a romantic film and you would not have known based on his performance. He also plays a cynic very well. Take for instance-one of my favorite scenes of the movie. Rick's nightclub musician, Sam is a mutual friend of both Rick and Ilsa. When Ilsa appears in the club for the first time, he plays ""A Time Goes By."" A song that defined the previous relationship of Rick's and Ilsa's. He angrily storms out of his office....and lays eyes on Ilsa. The acting he displayed there is tremendously powerful. Then we have Ingrid Bergman's strong performance as Ilsa. She tries to convince Rick she still loves him and still wants to be with him despite all the troubles going around in the world. The supporting cast is one of the better ones you will see in a movie of this time period. With the likes of Claude Rains, Conrad Veidt, Sydney Greenstreet, and Peter Lorre, this is truly an A-picture. <br/><br/>I mentioned much about the themes and the acting/characters, but I also really adore the craftsmanship that went into the movie. Michael Curtiz flawlessly directed the movie and got very strong performances from his actors, and the bold script was written by Julius Epstein and Philip Epstein. Their goal was to show us that our main characters lived during an incredibly complex time and well they certainly met their goal. They also created the rich characters of the supporting cast that led to the moral decisions made by our heroes. The black and white cinematography aged very well. I also liked the use of music with the film. <br/><br/>Casablanca is a very important film and is one of the greatest films of all time, in my opinion. I was blown away by the film's majesty. The acting, the music, the direction, the themes, the cinematography.....it all screams perfection. What also moves me is that much of the cast and crew were affected by Hitler's scourge of Europe. Many of these people escaped or have family suffering under his regime. I applaud the courage of the cast and crew who made this film that was released during the height of World War 2. If you are searching for a film that is a popular case study for critics and audiences alike or if you want to see a film that reminds you why you love movies, seek out Casablanca. <br/><br/>My Grade: A+"

","Whenever I talk about movies with someone, I would refer to most older movies that I grew up watching. But for me, Casablanca is a movie that I grew older watching. Since many have commented on its plot and greatness, I will skip the obligated summary of Casablanca and go immediately into my review.<br/><br/>Casablanca is a movie that has matured with me; the more life experiences I had, the more enjoyable it was. As an example, the scene where Ilsa listens to Sam play As Time Goes By seemed extraneous before I experienced my first heartbreak. Now, when I hear her tear up with the song in the background, I feel like I could cry with her. <br/><br/>The movie was more enjoyable the more I watched it as well. For the first time, I thought it was all right. But on the subsequent viewings, I saw the small nuances and expressions in Rick and Ilsa's actions as they tried to stay casual despite having a tragic past; I recognized that all the dialogue was necessary to accumulate in an unforgettable ending; and as I mentioned above, I empathized with the characters more and more.<br/><br/>Watching Casablanca is like watching the sunset.

In summary, a disruption of the life everyone knew. <br/><br/>Rick and his cafe summarized alittle bit of what this world had become. A story with many stories interwoven inside it. Mystery.

","A classic. Terrific actors, without exception (I wished Peter Lorre's part were longer). Great production. Incredible direction (look out for the head profile shots at the end, at the airport - that still remains striking). Unsurpassed screenplay. I could have taken a star off though because plot developments are glossed over too quickly. Bogart holds it all together and was never better. Movie captures the tension, desperation, romance and sacrifice of wartime magnificently. Only other criticism is over-use of music to manipulate viewer's response. Too noticeable. 
SPOILER ALERT. As examples of rushed developments: Rick's change of conviction and Ilsa's acceptance of Rick's decision that he is staying and she has to leave with Laszlo. Hard to believe she would be comfortable leaving it up to Rick to tell her husband she was leaving him. And her decision not to meet him at the train station in Paris (after she learns Laszlo is still alive) because she thought Rick wouldn't leave Paris without her - well, to be kind to her I guess she believed that Rick would get over her in time and didn't need to know she was married (I realise Laszlo wanted to keep their marriage a secret to protect her but I think in the circumstances Rick could have been told). Because the movie never loses tension any of its shortfalls are masterfully hidden. It all passes in a whirl and the movie is over before you know it!
Trivia: Hitler is never mentioned. Only a portrait in Strasser's office. 
An interesting approach to the film is to look at it as Rick's ultimate revenge on Ilsa for deserting him in Paris. He really deserts her at the end. She has no choice but to go with Laszlo. Rick could have got a letter of transit from Ferrari at the Blue Parrott. Ferrari had offered one to Laszlo and Ilsa but they had turned it down because they wanted to leave together. It seems incredible looking back that Ilsa was willing to leave her husband behind in Casablanca to fly off to Lisbon with Rick. It was really only Rick who forced her hand to leave with her husband."

","Ah the old black and whites from the days when movies were really movies based on good directing, quality acting and decent story-telling all of which you will find here plus more. The movie pulls you in right away and one can relate to all the scenes and what is behind them. The feel of being in another country comes through as well and that is why we so much like Ricks Café and all that goes on within those walls. Gambling in the back room had to be approved by Rick. Anyone was welcomed at the bar and Rick controlled it all and everyone liked it that way. This is one of the classics and worthy of a watch and of your DVD collection too. Hey while you are watching the movie, it will be saying to you..."
"gbill-74877","10","2","2","29 November 2017"," Romantic, gritty, stoic, larger than life, and epic
","There's not really much one can add all of the comments about this film, a masterpiece that is truly deserving of being in the list of top movies of all time. The story is perfectly crafted, intersecting a love triangle with the crushing pressures of wartime, and It's perfectly told by Director Michael Curtiz, with a flashback, a few surprises, and not a single wasted shot. Most importantly, the film captures the feeling of those huge moments in life that we'll always remember, where everything in one's life pivots, as well as the pain of love lost. Bogart holding that note in the rain, the ink beginning to run down as he's urged to get on the train, is later mirrored by him watching the plane disappear into the fog, the signal light reducing to a pinprick, and both moments are incredibly poignant.<br/><br/>The cast is also outstanding – Bogart and Bergman of course, but also almost all of the supporting characters. Claude Rains as the Vichy French captain whose loyalties sway in the wind is my personal favorite. In a sweeping story that could have easily been cloying or corny, there is great realism in characters who are morally ambivalent (Rains, Lorre, and Bogart himself) put next to those who are willing to sacrifice themselves for a good cause, and those bent on taking over the world. There are many wonderful scenes, and not just those between Bogart and Bergman. Paul Henreid is great with Bergman too, and the scene where he leads the French ex-pats in singing 'La Marseillaise' to drown out the German officers singing their own patriotic is rousing. And let's not forget Dooley Wilson, who is so smooth, singing among other things the iconic ""As Time Goes By"". This film is romantic, gritty, stoic, larger than life, and epic - and one that I never get tired of seeing."
"shadow_blade-89459","10","2","2","27 October 2017"," Classic
","""Casablanca"" (1942) is the golden standard for film even with a few minor flaws. The movie is about nightclub owner, Richard ""Rick"" Blaine played by Humphrey Bogart, and his vision on life as he knows it. He is faced with tough decisions that he easily overcomes or easily pushes away until his one true love, Ilsa Lund played by Ingrid Bergman, appears on his doorstep.<br/><br/>The scripting in this film is ""cheesy"" by modern day conversations standards, but is still powerful. If you watch this film, you will find yourself quoting some of these famous lines. Every shot is intentional. Michael Curtiz shoots with a purpose. If a scene is intended for you to feel an emotion, Curtiz shoots in a way to help you feel that emotion.<br/><br/>The film is visually black and white, but mentally colorful. Rick is the man men want to be. Tough as nails with a soft spot that no one knows, but himself. If you want to know how to effectively tell an emotionally entertaining story, this is the film to watch."
"callienne","10","2","2","27 September 2017"," A great classic that surely deserves a comeback
","Set against the exotic backdrop of French colonial Morocco, Casablanca combines the thrill of wartime espionage and conspiracy with a glamorous cast of international characters reflecting contemporary politics. This prestigious title is rightfully considered a classic among many critics; the excellent atmospheric shots and dialogue capture one's imagination and transports a viewer into it's characters' precarious circumstances. We follow American expat Rick Blane through a minefield of political drama and personal deceit as he navigates his way and makes his choices between assisting his former lover and her freedom-fighter husband, and a collaborating, corrupt official and his Nazi superiors. Morals and personal scores are pitted against each other in the dramatic arena of murder and mystery that is Casablanca."

","While there's not anything new to be said about ""Casablanca"", it's good to see one of the classics still getting some attention. By most standards it is at least very good, and there are good reasons why so many still remember it so fondly. Not everyone who watches it today shares the opinion that it is a classic, but it's still good to see fans of modern movies giving it a try for themselves.<br/><br/>The cast is one of its main strengths, not just Bogart and Bergman but also the fine supporting cast. Rains, Greenstreet, Lorre, and the others are indispensable to the atmosphere and the story, and each has some very good moments. It does have its imperfections, but it was not expected to be a classic or blockbuster - everything you read about the production suggests that it was made in a rather slap-dash fashion, under constraints that would have wrecked most other films. It's not hard to see the little ways that this affected the finished product, such as the times when the plot strains credibility a bit, or the characters seem to behave somewhat oddly. (In particular, it might have been even more satisfying if Bergman's character had been a little stronger - Ilsa is charming, but that's entirely thanks to what Bergman does with her; the character herself as written seems somewhat shallow.)<br/><br/>But it turned out anyway to be an excellent combination of actors, characters, and story, a combination that more than makes up for everything else. Different viewers probably remember and enjoy ""Casablanca"" for different reasons, because it seemingly has a little of everything. While perhaps not perfect, it is well worth remembering and watching."

Consider the fact that Bogart's character Rick represents the social and military isolationism of the US prior to the war and how he changes to making sacrifices for the good of the cause.  ""The lives of 2 human beings don't add up to a hill of beans"" so he gives her up for the greater good. That's Hollywood telling us that we need to sacrifice in our personal lives in order to fight for the greater good.

","Simply put: the best American film of all time and I ain't kidding. I've seen it no less than one dozen times and each viewing has a bit more than the last.Simply impossible to believe that during the making of it,the original writers, the Epstein Brothers, walked out in disgust and in came Howard Koch, the author of the famous 1938 Mercury Theater Orson Welles's ""War of the Worlds"" based on H.G.'s masterpiece. That's right-the Epsteins said the film was going nowhere-they took a hike and Bogey and Koch sat down and together completed the script. Even Ingrid Bergman, after shooting was done, said she never wanted to be associated with such garbage again. Oh heck, I could write a million words of praise about ""Casablanca"" but never could I impart the true greatness of the film. It's got to be seen to be believed. The whole darn thing is engrossing, enchanting, mesmerizing,tough,tender,stirring,nationalistic,anti-Nazi and that's only the beginning. ""As Time Goes By"" is not only one of America's greatest love songs but just about the one song most closely associated with any film. Dooley Wilson looks like he's playing it but the truth is that the man didn't know how to play the piano. But who cares,Miss Ilsa? Want to know how good is that picture? Ever hear of anyone buying and devouring three books about it? I did. (1)""Casablanca"" by Richard Anobile,(2) ""Casablanca"" by Howard Koch and (3)the most definitive work ever written about the film,the 402 page tome,""Round Up the Usual Suspects"" by Aljean Harmetz which I read twice. Enough said."

","I can't see what to write here, since so many people will be moved by this film and write something about their experience in seeing it, often time after time, ""As Time Goes By"". This is a freeze frame of American war propaganda at its highest point, with an array of America's greatest filmmakers collaborating at the beginning of World War II, right after the attack on Pearl Harbor. It is a work that will always be seen and be honored as the epitome of world film-art that it is. Don't take anything for granted when you watch this movie. It all has to do with time, place, and character. It's so easy to get embroiled in one or two of the character's performances that you'll miss half of the film. It's an amazing film to watch multiple times."

","When Hal Wallis and Michael Curtiz paired Humphrey Bogart with Ingrid Bergman, Paul Henreid, Sydney Greenstreet, and Peter Lorre...well, that combination in and of itself was sufficient to make the movie a ""box office"" smash. However, the year was 1942 and the subject matter and scenario in 'Casablanca' was quite the contemporary issue for that time. No one could know the events that would occur in the following years, as the world waged the brutal battles of World War II. Yet, out of the growing global chaos, Curtiz was able to direct a masterpiece that will continue to rank among the best films ever made. This is classic, quintessential ""Bogey"" at his very best. Starring as Rick Blaine, with his sharp, if not, brash style, Bogart gives such life to this character with incredible precision, that he's worthy to be remembered for the classic line ""Here's looking at you kid...""<br/><br/>Matched with the stellar performances of the other cast members, this movie will always be an industry standard for it's brilliance and consuming style.

My favorite line of her: ""You know how much I loved you, how much I still love you"" But in general I think this movie just rocks the cinema. I have seen it once on the big screen and it was so different from watching it on TV. I bought that film in two versions (english+german) and I'm planning on buying it in italian, too.

Humphrey Bogart is the archetypical softie with the hard, cynical shell, Paul Heinreid is a wonderfully noble leader of men, Ingrid Bergman truly makes you believe that a man could obsess about her for years.  Claude Rains is wonderfully devillish as the corrupt prefect of police, Sidney Greenstreet positively Machiavellian as a business rival and Peter Lorre incredible as a cheap hood.<br/><br/>Watch this movie, and for the love of all that's holy, make sure it is in the original black and white!"

My summer ran out before I could round out the top twenty, but of the handful that I got around to seeing, ""Casablanca"" was my favorite.<br/><br/>I'm currently enrolled in a Gangster Films class, where we screen and discuss classic films in the gangster genre.  Having seen films like the original ""Scarface,"" ""The Public Enemy,"" and others, it amazes me that, while these films are great, they feel extremely dated.<br/><br/>The dialogue is clearly circa 1930, and the sets are all clearly just that, sets.<br/><br/>But then, you see ""Casablanca.""  While the film is now 60 years old, it still holds up to modern cinema in every way.  The characters are believable and sympathetic.  Rick's unrequited love is painful (emotionally, not because it's awful, because it's not) to watch, not because Bogart is a great actor (though he is.  One of the best), but because it's written in such a way that all of us who have ever pined for ""the one who got away"" know exactly how he feels.<br/><br/>I'll spare you a summary, because by now, you know the story.  You know the dialogue, you know the shots.  ""Casablanca"" is one of the most important films ever.  It is almost perfect.<br/><br/>It is my sincere hope that the handful of people who gave this film a 1 out of 10 had mistaken 1 as being the highest mark available, because I'd hate to thank that anyone could possibly dislike this film."

","I discovered this movie about 15 years ago. I'm 33-years-old and had never really been one to go back and watch old black-and-white movies. The first movie I ever really remember going to see at the theater was Raiders of the Lost Ark. I was in love with the movies from then on. Oh, sure, I'd gone to the drive-in in rural Alabama and had seen various movies. But I had been too young and immature to really appreciate them for what they were. But when my uncle took me to see Raiders, I was hooked. For years, I considered Spielberg's masterpiece to be the best movie ever made. But then I happened to get hold of a VHS copy of Casablanca and checked it out. WOW! Moviemaking had been redefined for me. This movie has it all. Bogart is such an incredible presence. I think Harrison Ford is our modern-day answer to Bogart. The story is so straight-forward and so cool ... the backstory about the romance in Paris is great, perfectly handled. The one-liners are unforgettable, and the songs are enchanting. This is the whole package, alright. Perfect movie."

"stikedc","10","2","2","28 June 2002"," I said, ""22""!
","There's nothing like a Romantic Classic, and since the AFI recently named ""Casablanca"" as the Number One romance film of all time, here's yet another review for the Film That Has It All.  As the IMDB tagline says, ""They had a date with fate!""<br/><br/>""Casablanca"" will take you away to a time and a place where good guys (Humphrey Bogart's Rick Blaine, who runs ""Rick's Café Americain,"" an oasis with the best music in town) were good, though flawed, bad guys were nasty Nazis, and beautiful women were, well, in a word, Ilsa (Ingrid Bergman). The closeups of her alone are worth the price of admission.<br/><br/>Based on a play, ""Everybody Comes to Rick's Place,"" the movie's dialogue is spectacular -- Rick and Louie's (Claude Rains) banter in particular is very funny, witty, and fast-paced, with no fat. The film's black-and-white texture and the exotic setting in Casablanca paint a picture of a time and a place where things fall into the grey areas in a world starkly divided between Axis and Allies.  The quirky market scenes and the opening narration (with the map, to show you exactly where Casablanca is located) set the stage for the events to follow.<br/><br/>Claude Rains and Peter Lorre (who makes an early exit) complement Bogie perfectly, and the supporting cast -- Paul Henreid as Czech underground resistance leader (and Ilsa's husband) Victor Laszlo, the German couple trying to get to America, and Sydney Greenstreet as Ferrari, the city's black marketeer -- are nothing short of spectacular.  Every actor in this movie makes their characters 100 percent real.<br/><br/>The entire plot -- based on Laszlo's mysterious entry into Casablanca and whether he will be able to get out to carry on his fight against the Germans -- is riveting.  Perhaps the most incredible thing about the movie is when it was made: 1942, in the heart of World War II, when the outcome was not assured.<br/><br/>There are so many great and memorable lines in this movie that it's impossible to list them all.  It is worth noting that Rick never actually says ""Play it again, Sam"" -- he says, ""Play it, Sam!"" in a drunken stupor after Ilsa returns to his ""gin joint."" Louie's (Rains) line, ""I'm shocked, shocked, that there is gambling in this establishment!"" is almost a cliché today for things that are not really that surprising.  I love the roulette scene, where Rick sets up a win to help a Bulgarian émigré, and his line ""Have you tried 22? I said, 22!"" is also one of my personal favorites.<br/><br/>And of course, there's The Song: ""As Time Goes By"" -- the one Ilsa, and Rick, wanted to hear again and again -- is one of the most memorable in the history of film.<br/><br/>""Casablanca"" is about politics; it's got political intrigue, tons of hard drinking, a love triangle to end all love triangles, a few choice fight scenes (where the nasties get theirs good), and about the choices we make in hard, crucial situations in life.  But ""Casablanca"" is, more than anything else, a love story, and without giving away too much, ultimately about one of life's greatest lessons: Letting Go. The flashback scene to Rick and Ilsa's years in Paris is one of the most memorable in all of film. The airport ending is classic and will give you chills -- be sure to bring a hankie!<br/><br/>Note:  Keep an eye out for ""Casablanca"" on the Big Screen in the summer -- it's a favorite for the outdoor free film fests and a perfect movie for a date or with family & friends!  (Probably teens & up, younger kids wouldn't get it.)"
"lasserre","10","2","2","23 June 2002"," effortless
","The lasting attraction of this film must be its seemingly effortless use of the medium.  We know that Casablanca was at the time one of dozens of ""cardboard cutout"" features from Warner Brothers' World War Two domestic audience assembly line.  This film was not intended to be a classic.  What happened?  One can watch this movie without sound and marvel at the human struggle in northern Africa. Did Michael Curtiz perfect his directorial technique during the silent film era?  Obviously his silent film experience is evident.  Why watch Casablanca with the sound off?  One would miss the orchestration by Max Steiner and vocal by Arthur Dooley.  The dialogue is very rich, the plot compelling and acting perfect.  Someone will try to convince you that this whole effort was well planned.  My understanding is that it was not.  This film is an accident that happens only once every few generations and it is a joy to experience again and again."

","Quite possibly the greatest, if not most entertaining, motion picture ever made, Casablanca shines like platinum.

Perhaps it is the writing: unforgettable from ""Here's looking at you, kid"" to ""We'll always have Paris"" to ""This looks like the beginning of a beautiful friendship.""  Perhaps it was just the serendipitous combination of assembled personnel once cameras began to roll on the Warner Brothers lot during WWII. Rick's internal conflict, so simply presented in the movie, conceals an existential dilemma that stands at the heart of Casablanca's enduring legacy: the difficulty of taking the morally responsible action even (or rather, especially) when it is at the expense of personal desires."

At the time it was made, it was put together in a rush by a whole group of different scriptwriters, with most of the people involved in the film seeing it as nothing special. I agree with them! I found it generally trite and predictable. Almost everything about this film is artificial - the setting, the plot and the ending, as is normally the case in wartime propaganda films hastily put-together or not. The person whose fate we are supposed to care about is presented one-dimensionally, whilst the characteristic which defines Bogart for what he is (hard-bitten worldly cynicsym) is the characteristic he will have to lose if the film is to have a schmaltzy ending. What is his real motivation? Why does he do the things he does? There is really no character development at all. Does he believe in ideals and if he does do they have to be other people's? Or is he just chivalrous, or even whimsical or perverse? At a time when the British Empire was close to exhaustion and millions had died in Russia and central Europe, there is a little too much of the lone American saving the conscience of the world about it for comfort. Of course, the makers of the film only ever intended to make a simple propaganda film and they did their job well.They gave the audience the Bogey they wanted and were suitably rewarded with affection from more than one generation of filmgoers. But this is not a serious film, whatever Woody Allen may think."

","Some of this review was edited due to this site's word limit.<br/><br/>Regarding ""Casablanca,"" Roger Ebert wrote in his Great Movies essay, ""If we can identify strongly with characters in some movies, then it is no mystery that 'Casablanca' is one of the most popular films of all time."" Add ""and one of the most memorable"" to that statement. Almost any list you happen to come across of great movies will contain ""Casablanca,"" as it has almost nestled itself firmly into our world's foundation. It is what one would call a memorable film. It may not be memorable for the audiences of today who find it boring, long, weary and tiresome, but it will always be remembered. That isn't something you can say for most movies. In one hundred years, do you think ""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy will really - really - be remembered?<br/><br/>""Casablanca"" is a love story, just as so many other films released to this day, but upon a viewing two nights ago, I asked myself what sets it apart from the rest. Just what has made it what it is today? Is it the direction by Michael Cortiz, the chemistry between the actors, or the actors themselves? Is it the sly side of dark comedy, or just the nostalgia of the film that drives so many viewers? Or perhaps it is the cliffhanger finale (those filming the movie didn't even know what would happen at the end of the film due to constantly changing scripts and the 1940s Production Code permitting a married woman from leaving her husband for another man). Even if it isn't, the ending is superb, depressing and uplifting, one of the strangest, saddest, and happiest endings I have ever seen, in which Bogart mutters the famous last lines, ""I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship.""<br/><br/>Bogart plays Rick Blaine, a chain smoker and heavy drinker living in Casablanca, French Morocco, during WWII. During WWII, European immigrants fled from their homeland down to Africa, in hopes of sailing off the coast to Portugal, and then to America, land of freedom. Because of this, Casablanca is inhabited by petty thieves, vicious murderers, and ruthless citizens. Every day a plane leaves from the local airport, carrying the precious few with Visa Passes to freedom. Those applying for a Visa Pass on the black market might come in contact with the crook Ugarte (Peter Torre).<br/><br/>One night the thief Ugarte visits Rick's bar in Casablanca and asks him to hide two Visa Passes he has acquired by unrespectable means. Rick reluctantly agrees, only to watch Ugarte be taken away by French officials the same night, in his very bar. ""Rick, you have to help me!"" he screams as he is dragged away. Rick takes a puff on his cigarette and remains solid. A bystander says, ""Gee, Rick, I hope when they come to take me away you help me out a little bit more than that!"" Rick remains a statue and says, ""I stick my neck out for nobody.""<br/><br/>We can sense Rick was a good guy at one time, but as Marilyn Monroe once said, he probably ""got the fuzzy end of the lollipop."" He is tired of fighting for the good cause. So he maintains his bar and tries not to care about anyone. His piano player Sam (Dooley Wilson) knows the real Sam, and tries to evoke it, but Sam just sits in silence and drinks and smokes and lets himself stay drenched in misty smoke.<br/><br/>That all remains until Ilsa Lund (Ingrid Bergman) walks through his doors. It turns out that Ilsa left Sam and Rick waiting at a train station in the rain some time ago in Paris, France, during the German occupation. Rick never saw her since. That night she walks into his bar, he sits at a table in his joint, and in a mopy tone says, ""Of all the gin joints in all the world, she walks into mine."" This is a very effective line.<br/><br/>Do delve into the plot any further is pointless. Not only will it spoil interesting tidbits, but it is just plain pointless to explain anymore. But I will say that every frame is handled with care and the extreme close-ups in this film are amazingly effective. Sergio Leone was known for his extreme close-ups, but those in ""Casablanca"" seem to capture an innocence of the characters that I have rarely seen equaled in other films.<br/><br/>Bogart is at the top of his game in this film, only equaled in ""The Maltese Falcon."" Ingrid Bergman is superb, as well, but the supporting cast is equally impressive. Sydney Greenstreet, Peter Lorre, Claude Rains, Peter Henreid and Dooley Wilson all steal the show - well, maybe not Henreid, but that's because he's not really supposed to. This is the perfect example of a well-rounded cast. Too often nowadays attention is paid to the lead actors and not the supporters - this has both great leads and great supporters.<br/><br/>People often ask me what my favorite film is. And to be frankly honest, it certainly isn't ""Casablanca."" To me, lists of favorites in ranking order are pointless and silly - who am I to declare my favorite film, when I have not even seen some of the greatest unknown films out there? If someone asks me to tell them my favorite film I have seen, I usually say I don't have one. I still think lists of favorite-ever films are silly. I have various favorites in various genres, but not an ""all-time-favorite."" <br/><br/>Despite this, ""Casablanca"" is one of those films that has permeated our culture. It will never go away. I'm not sure if it's one of my top ten favorites, but if there is a difference between a favorite film and a most memorable film, ""Casablanca"" sure does disguise it."
"Gubby-Allen","3","24","53","18 April 2002"," Dull & way overrated
","I'm not going to slate the film any more than that, as millions still love it now, so it must be me that's in the wrong, but it was such a hard film to watch.<br/><br/>The acting was faultless. But that's it really. The ending going against typical Hollywood happy ones, is the only other praise I could give this.<br/><br/>The 1st half hour or so of Casablanca wasn't bad at all & set up some fairly interesting premises. Likewise the last 15 minutes was an ending that still stands up well today. <br/><br/>But the period between 30-75 minutes was 3/4 of an hour of chronic boredom. There was no character to connect to or like until the finale & what plot there was, was in no way enjoyable. <br/><br/>Good cinematography, romance & Nazi's together seem to account for the popularity of this, but in reality it was poorly executed & lacked a plot that could hold the viewer's attention.<br/><br/>There was too much dialogue sometimes & seemed an attempt to cram as many 'cool' lines into the film as possible. Some of them were good & fitted in well, but others, particularly ""here's looking at you kid"" don't hold up well at all, & by the 3rd or 4th time, made you cringe.<br/><br/>A 50 word review of the film makes it seem fairly straightforward. Granted, the main plot was, but I had real trouble understanding the sub-plots & relevance of some of the secondary events & storylines or characters.<br/><br/>Though this wasn't an awful film at all & may go up a mark or two more with another viewing. But like Citizen Kane which I found far worse, it seems another one thats liked because it's been drummed into everyone for 50 years that it's a classic & so we're supposed to like it. <br/><br/>But then what do I know, I'm just an ordinary bloke.<br/><br/>3/10"
"rickhavoc1","10","8","14","3 September 2007"," Why I think Casablanca is better than Citizen Kane
","I know everyone won't agree with me, but I think Casablanca is the better movie for the following reasons.<br/><br/>1. Better cast. Humphrey Bogart vs. Orson Welles? No contest. Ingrid Bergman vs. any of the actresses in CK? Again, no contest. The same goes for the rest.<br/><br/>2. Better, tighter plot and pacing. The plot and pacing of Casablanca is totally superior. You have to pay attention through the entire movie or you will miss crucial dialog or plot developments. Citizen Kane's plot moves at a snail's pace by comparison, and it's non-linear, which makes it more confusing. Plus, Casablanca tells a better story.<br/><br/>3. Better romance. Who even talks about the romance in Citizen Kane? <br/><br/>4. Greater truths explored. While the truths explored in Citizen Kane are important, (limits of wealth and power, the dangers of one man gaining too much power), Casablanca explores more and greater truths, such as freedom being worth any sacrifice, that no matter how many people tyrants kill there are always others who will step up to replace them, how America was seen as the last hope for freedom by those trying to escape from or being oppressed by Nazi tyranny, the critical importance of fidelity in marriage, (which CK barely touched on), and how totally cynical men like Rick and Captain Renault could become patriots, just to name a few.<br/><br/>5. Better musical score. Although both scores were nominated for Academy Awards, I really think the score for Casablanca was far more memorable.<br/><br/>6. Many more memorable lines. Do I really have to go into this? I don't think so. Besides, plenty of others have already posted comments here about the many memorable lines in Casablanca. <br/><br/>7. More Academy Awards. 3 for Casablanca vs. 1 for Citizen Kane.<br/><br/>8. Better final scene. I just think seeing Rick and Captain Renault walking off together with the line, ""Louis, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship."" beats the scene of ""Rosebud"" being burned up all hollow. Plus, it touches on another truth, the importance of friendship.<br/><br/>9. Casablanca, as well as some of Hollywood's other greatest movies, was made following what I call the ""Indiana Jones Method"". They made it up as they went. Although it can be tough on the actors, this often results in a better movie.<br/><br/>10. Casablanca is both timely and timeless at the same time. The same could be said of Citizen Kane, but I think a fictionalized account of the life of William R. Hearst, (which is what everyone, including Hearst himself, thinks or thought CK is) grows LESS relevant as time passes. The timeless themes of Casablanca, lost love, resisting tyranny, patriotism, and freedom being worth any sacrifice will NEVER lose their relevance. Which is why it's so much more than just a WWII propaganda piece.<br/><br/>Although I have to admit a slight bias because the main character of Casablanca and I happen to share the same first name, I think I've shown enough other reasons why I prefer it. I honestly believe that the only reason the AFI rates Citizen Kane #1 is because of the many ground breaking techniques Orson Welles used to make it. As for me, I just think that, since the primary purpose of any movie is to tell a story, and use the story to explore and expound on truths that never change, story should trump technique every time. Movies that forget this almost never do well, and are usually soon forgotten. Citizen Kane barely broke even, but it shouldn't be forgotten. I just don't think it's the better movie."
"TheInvisibleCar","10","7","12","21 June 2007"," Still the greatest movie of all time!!!
","Casablanca is still the greatest movie of all time! Its stars shine, there are memorable lines, quite a few which have been repeated elsewhere or even become the titles of movies themselves, there is superbly artistic and notable cinematography, heartfelt romance, inspiring and touching music, heroes, swelling feelings of sentiment and patriotism, and it is in no way too long, too weird or different. Just an all around great movie, and even for the few of those who can't agree that Casablanca is the all-around greatest movie of all time, they perhaps would at least agree that it has all the elements and plenty enough of what it takes to be putting up an honorable fight to claim that top spot, and most definitely should be on any critic's short list of greatest movies, if they expect to really be taken seriously. .<br/><br/>Time seems to date some movies badly, while it has worked greatly in favor of some movies, like Casablanca. It was made in the day when color was rare, yet, used black in white so well that it seems to be a great example of a movie that should have been filmed in black and white, even if doing such were to have cost more than color. The false looking backgrounds in its Paris automobile scenes in particular, although perhaps not so intended, has actually been used as a purposeful technique of dreamy recollection and such, in a few more modern day films. And again, even though perhaps not intended at the time, and even though the entire movie was made in studio, the fact that the Paris scenes are the ones that look so particularly fake is appropriate, since, at that very time, those scenes had to be fake, as Paris wasn't available, because it was under German occupation. There is no understating that this movie was a part of the arsenal of democracy itself, its story, themes and passion are set in the very center of what was then the raging battle for the world in what would become the single most defining event of the 20th Century, World War II. Every actor in the film, the director, the producer, and anybody and everybody working on the film or in any way involved with its making, were, in fact, at war with Nazi Germany. <br/><br/>There is no need for a learned critic or professor to explain this or anything about the movie, anything about its producers having used some new technique, some new technology, or any particularly notable new style of cinematography to just enjoy Casablanca. It's very touching in its story of human relationships and it is so noted for its black and white cinematography that some of its most ardent fans consider any colorizations of it sacrilege, even among those of us not generally opposed to the idea of colorization. And, it is the story of its times. Its depiction of challenged French patriotism brings tears the eyes of many a repeat viewer time and time again, when The Marseilles is sung. There are lines that people repeat, songs that even today people sing and whistle. In terms of just all around sheer entertainment, the movie is petty much as good as it gets. It is not only difficult to come up with a suggestion of what movies of the 20th century could be considered as good, it's impossible to find any movie that has anywhere near as many people thinking of it as the greatest movie of the 20th century. It's as if a clear majority think it the greatest movie of all time, and as for what other movie is even a contender to Casablanca's claim to the title, well, there is no clear single contender. I doubt fans of Casablanca could even form a majority as to what the second greatest movie of all time is. Even if all those who have another movie in mind could have a run-off to determine their party's candidate, it wouldn't matter, as Casablanca already has 65% of the general electorate locked-up. Although all-time is far from over, it's safe to say that Casablanca is now the for-all-time greatest movie of the 20th Century. Its as if Indiana Jones was involved in some battle, in the middle of some war, that we were actually passionately involved in at the time, with our entire economy geared towards the goal of winning that war, against actual Nazis soldiers, rather than the theatrical Nazi-ish soldiers that Indiana Jones was having problems with. Except Casablanca's actors are legendary movie icons. The dialogue is superior. The musical score is among the best of movies, as memorable as even the best of musicals, only Casablanca isn't a musical. Just as the main song of the movie is about a fight for love and glory, exactly what the entire free western and allied world was engaged in at that time, so the viewer feels where they stand in their heart of hearts. The viewer relates to the characters, and anybody familiar with history who believes in freedom and democracy isn't just cheering for our characters in the end, we truly feel as if we are on their side! Had the allied battle been lost, Casablanca may very well have quickly become a controlled, discarded and forgotten piece of illicit war propaganda. But as things turned out, it's Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman, along with Dooley Wilson, Paul Henreid, Claude Rains and many others, starring in the greatest roles of their careers in what clearly still seems to be the greatest movie of all time. Casablanca's being part of the patriotic effort itself, is perhaps one of its greatest advantages in cementing its claim as the greatest movie of all time, and this is a concrete advantage that will only continue to strengthen and harden, ""As Time Goes By."""
"deuchler","10","7","12","14 February 2007"," Dooley Wilson as ""Sam""
","Everyone knows the line ""Play it again, Sam,"" never really occurs in the picture. Bogart doesn't say those actual words to Dooley Wilson. <br/><br/>""Casablanca"" is widely recognized as a nearly perfect example of a film produced during the peak of the Hollywood ""Studio Years."" It's a cultural treasure and justifiably beloved. But there is no getting around the fact that the role of Sam, the jazz pianist, is patronizingly written and the character is an unfortunate example of the Uncle Tom type of ""good black"" that so often crept into movies of that era.<br/><br/>The character of the pianist/singer in Rick's Cafe Americain was initially conceived of as a part for a female jazz artist like Hazel Scott, Ella Fitzgerald, or Lena Horne. Perhaps the subliminal sexuality of having a young African American woman so close to Rick (Bogart) made the Warner Bros. execs nervous. MGM, where Lena Horne was under contract, never quite knew how to deal with her beauty or sexuality. She was seldom part of a storyline but rather often featured as a performer in a nightclub sequence that could be snipped out in prints of the film being exhibited in the Deep South, thus not offending racists but not messing with the continuity of the plot. The role of the pianist was switched to a male character possibly to sidestep all the issues of miscegenation between the singer and ""Mr. Rick."" Racial mixing was one of the last taboos to go during the 30 year reign and enforcement of the Production Code.<br/><br/>Though the Bogart character is respectful of Sam and looks out for his best interests, making sure Sam is paid the same once he leaves Morocco, their relationship is not truly one of equals. Sam always refers to him as ""Mr. Rick"" and Bergman as ""Miss Ilsa."" Sam takes care of Rick and worries over his happiness and well-being. We know nothing of Sam's life or needs. All we know for sure is that Sam will do anything he can to keep these white folks happy.<br/><br/>When Bergman first spots Sam in the nightclub she inquires, ""Who is that boy playing the piano?"" BOY? Born in 1886, Dooley Wilson was 56 years old. Use of the term ""boy"" to refer to the musician is an unfortunate indication of the prevailing practice of denigrating black men's sexuality and maturity. One was a ""boy"" until one was 70.<br/><br/>Yet Warner Bros., more-so perhaps than the other big studios, was more liberated in terms of race and its depiction. The mere presence of Sam as a character indicated progress to many. But the role is definitely narrow and restrained, within the typical submissive image often delineated for blacks. At one point, and mercifully it's mostly cut, early in the film Sam begins to sing an old song called ""Shine."" (Shine was a racist term for an African American, like Coon or Jigaboo.) The number was a very racist tune of the early 20th Century---""Just because my hair is curly/ Just because my teeth are pearly..."" We are not subjected to the full song which is a catalog of stereotypic images---and then the song ends with the line ""That's why they call me Shine."" The full number is sung by dancer John Bubbles in MGM's ""Cabin in the Sky"" filmed that same year.<br/><br/>Dooley Wilson, by the way, was paid $350 per week to appear in ""Casablanca."" Sidney Greenstreet was paid $3,750 per week. <br/><br/>Dooley Wilson was one of the best jazz drummers of the era. It's ironic that he will always be remembered ""playing piano"" (and not a very good faking, at that) in ""Casablanca."" He did also sing well, and his performance is part of the stuff dreams were made of at Warner Bros.---preserved for posterity in this wonderful though clearly not perfect film."
"FinalChange","Null","6","10","22 December 2008"," Casablanca, a spiritual experience!
","Lauren Bacall was wonderful as Ilsa...in a parallel universe. Too bad it was Ingrid Bergman who ended up with the role, I just couldn't buy the Bogie'n Bergman love story and would have loved to see Lauren instead! So I gave this movie a 4, as soon as I was done watching. Because Bergman failed to convince me and I cringed at their Paris scenes. I mean Bogie, romantic?! Are you kiddin' me?! (I was even more shocked to see Bogie smile!) I was bored through the story, the men's thick black eyeliner looked like an ethnic joke, their white eyeliner was a little less distracting, but I've seen worse, so I decided what the heck, I'm 1/4th through this movie might as well keep going since it's not like it's starring *insert your most insipid actress and buffoon of an actor here* And OK, since I'm well-endowed in the ""suspend disbelief"" department, I'll pretend I'll buy Ingmar Bergman or whatever as the love interest.<br/><br/>Since some of the dialog was amazing, I thought I'd actually give this a 7. For effort. Plus the ""last night was so long ago/tonight? I don't plan that far ahead"" exchange was awesome. (I'm gonna have to memorize these lines, I'm sure to use them sometime!) And the music was not bad. So what the heck, it doesn't deserve a 7 but I'm not in a bad mood tonight and it's Christmas, right?! But what the **** happened to ""Play it again, Sam!""? I never once heard it and I felt ripped off throughout the movie! I heard ""Play it, Sam"" Who misquotes a movie, really? OUTRAGEOUS!!! Just for that, I felt like I needed a refund, and let me tell you, that 7 was quickly turning into a 5. Plus I'd seen the final scene, the Bogie/Bergman exchange, final scene, it says so on You Tube. Right? So who cares, I already know how it ends. <br/><br/>Well...Wrong!!! <br/><br/>It wasn't the final scene after all! WTH??! After years of believing that's how it ended, now they ripoff the ending too by adding some insipid action? Couldn't they have been done at that scene since it's *supposed* to be the only end anyone cares about? (After all, it's the only one ""they"" ever show!! What else could there be, really?!) Well, in the end--and sorry to put it this way if you kinda like this film--but what do you think I could possibly give this sorry little B&W film maker's menial effort of a wanna-be movie? Well, if you should know I only gave it a mere TEN! That's right! Was I glad I stuck with it till the end! It got better and better until it became one of the best movies ever! I didn't expect the surprise ending, that's for sure! Blown away! <br/><br/>This one is definitely worth a re-watch sometime soon, minus my ""Dancing-with-the-Stars-judge-raising-score-on-a-panel-every-5-secs"" attitude. I don't think I've ever seen a movie where I went from ""who gives a c^^p about you?"" to absolutely blown away by the characters and their turn of events. In a sense I went from caring about Rick just about as little as Rick himself did to making a 180 degree turnabout. Sort of like Rick did at the end! Amazing!! And Ingrid Bergman was indeed good, certainly not my first choice for Ilsa--still would have loved to see Bacall--but she held her own. Here's looking at you, Kid! It's like after the movie was over, I came to the realization that I had been a Rick of sorts throughout. And the movie took me through my own 180. <br/><br/>Does everyone feel like this when watching this movie? Is it supposed to turn us all into Ricks and then flip-flop us around leaving us utterly dazed and not knowing what hit us there for a second? Or is it just me? It almost felt like a spiritual experience! Almost! It was simply amazing! 10/10. Come what may, I'll always have Casablanca in my DVD collection!"
"Electrified_Voltage","10","6","10","3 August 2007"," Decades have gone by, but this one remains a classic!
","I first became aware of this film's existence back when I was around nine years old, but never actually saw it. At the time, I highly doubt that was a great loss for me, as if I did see ""Casablanca"" when I was that young, there probably wouldn't have been many words for me to use to describe what I thought of it, other than ""boring."" However, I finally watched it for the first time about eleven years later, earlier this year, and was very impressed, even though I wouldn't have given it a 10/10 at the time. Since then, for me, it has improved with more viewings! <br/><br/>The film is set during World War II in Casablanca, Morocco, where many European refugees, fleeing from the Nazis, had to come in order to have any hope of getting to Lisbon, then to America. Rick Blaine is an American in exile who runs a nightclub in the Moroccan city. He is very cynical and ""sticks his neck out for nobody."" After it is announced that two German couriers have been murdered, Ugarte, the murderer, comes to Rick's club and asks him to hold on to two letters of transit for a while. Shortly afterwards, Ugarte is arrested, so Rick is stuck with these letters. The nightclub owner is then informed that Victor Laszlo, the European Resistance leader, is coming to Casablanca, and Major Strasser of the Gestapo tells him to make sure Victor doesn't escape from the city. Victor comes to Casablanca with Ilsa Lund, Rick's former love who left him in Paris! At first, Rick is not pleased to see Ilsa again. Ilsa and Victor have come for the two letters, but convincing Rick to give them to the couple won't be easy!<br/><br/>It has been 65 years since ""Casablanca"" was first shown to the public, and since then, many people from generation after generation have seen it and have been blown away! With its poignancy, suspense, strong dialogue, romance, etc., this 1942 motion picture is a work of genius, and there's nothing surprising about its wide appeal! So, if you want to see a stunning love story, set and made during WWII, and movies don't require a whole ton of action to impress you, I would say ""Casablanca"" is a must-see! If you don't love it right away, maybe you never will, or maybe it will grow on you with a second or third viewing!"
"MartinHafer","10","9","17","30 December 2008"," A perfect film.
","Although I have so far reviewed over 5700 films, I haven't yet reviewed CASABLANCA--mostly because nothing I can say about the film can add to the many excellent and insightful reviews for this cinematic masterpiece. But, having seen it several times, I guess it's worth at least saying a few words out the film.<br/><br/>Although Humphrey Bogart is one of the finest actors ever and he made many, many wonderful films, I think it's not much of a stretch to say this is his best performance and best film. He was perfect for the world-weary and cynical Rick. Sure, African QUEEN, THE CAINE MUTINY and several other of his films were brilliant, but none come close to CASABLANCA because in my opinion CASABLANCA is a perfect film--or about as close to one as you can find. If IMDb were not so heavily weighted in favor of newer films (just look at the top 250), it probably would be at the top of the list. For example, you can't seriously think that THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION and THE DARK KNIGHT are better films, though they both are ranked higher on the list. Now this isn't to say these are bad films--heck they are terrific,...just not in the same category as CASABLANCA.<br/><br/>Aside from Bogart, the film also is directed perfectly by Michael Curtiz--with excellent pacing, atmosphere and charm. The supporting cast is amazing--one of the best you could find in a film. In addition to the great stock Warner Brothers character actors (such as Sydney Greenstreet, Peter Lorre and Cuddles Sakall), Conrad Veidt is the perfect scary Nazi, Claude Rains is his usual wonderful self, Ingrid Bergman luminous and Paul Henreid, though a great actor, is somewhat lost among all the immense talent! Amazing music, a top script and all the style and quality that Warner Brothers could muster--this is my pick for top film ever. A fine romance and a fine film about people."

","I read all the other ""user's comments"", and found out there are only 3 among those 54 who didn't like this movie!! Well, I will add to that short list. Ever since I was a kid, I heard of Casablanca as ""one of the best movies ever made"". Sorry, folks. I watched it three times, and the more I watch the less I like it.<br/><br/>The characters are as empty as sea-shells. Bogart (whom I never found a bit attractive anyway) mumbles through the story, as a one-dimensional ""cynical with a big heart"" (my god, what a novelty!!), Bergman cries a lot, but as a compliant female does what she's told and follows her husband: Rick is a man, he knows what's best for her, and her husband needs her support, he's a war hero!! I would rather be alone, anyway, if I had to  choose between dull Laszlo and cowardly Rick!<br/><br/>Fortunately Claude Rains can be funny, though utterly unlikely as an officer who at the last moment chooses to ""be good"". Nothing is convincing!<br/><br/>I have nothing against ""classics"", as Parca (another user) said before: I love Lawrence of Arabia, The Night of the Hunter (now THAT is a movie!!), Gone With the Wind...

"rajdoctor","8","5","8","28 July 2007"," Casablanca
","Here is looking at you kid, these words are written by my current boss Bernhard Drumel in his skype. I never knew that they are from Casablanca, until I saw the movie.<br/><br/>This is a love story during the world war second based in Casablanca, Morocco, North West Africa  a port where refugee Europeans came to depart for USA. Old time lovers - Rick (Humphrey Bogart) and Lisa (Ingrid Bergman), meet after many years in Casablanca and remember their love in France. Lisa was and is wife of Victor (Paul Henreid) and the couple is planning to run away to America through Casablanca. Rick - now the owner of the most popular club in Casablanca is well connected among corrupt military and government machinery - sacrifices his love and helps the couple duo to go to America.<br/><br/>It is the not the story in itself, but the way it is told that makes it a very interesting viewing. The pace is fast and engrossing. The story slowly unfolds and never lets the viewers guess the next till the very end. There is a sense of mystery and suspense. The backbone of the movie is a love story that has gone wrong. It connects with every audience. The misery and cynicism of Rick is so real that every man may feel a close resemblance to the feeling Rick is having. Though many, there are well itched characters that define the intent and purpose of their words and actions. The characters  mostly representing different European countries  and give an universal appeal to western audiences, and so I understand its relevance in people's mind and popularity.<br/><br/>The character of Rick is brilliantly played by the chain smoking king Bogart. This was my first movie of Bogart and he impressed me the most. Like all olden days actors who  each one of them  had their unique style and so delight to watch; Bogart has his own. Ingrid looks and acts beautifully to say and hide her secrets with her eyes and body language. Paul Henreid was good, but not brilliant. Special mention of the local French Captain Renault, played by Claude Rains  who plays the most engrossing characters with black and white, shrewd and sober shades  a delight to watch him.<br/><br/>Each and every dialogue of the movie is perfect and catchy. The lines are worth repeating even today and written with so conviction that they are ever-green. The one that I personally liked the most was when the German commander asks Rick which nationality he belongs to; and Rick with his usual cynicism replies  I am a drunkard. There are so many such quotable lines almost unforgettable in the movie.<br/><br/>This was Director Martin Curtiz's 132 movie production as director. It took him almost 20 years of making movie to come out with this gem. Martin kept on making movies till the last year 1961; he died in 1962. Great music, fantastic choreography of people, and definite acting by most crew! The only thing I disliked about the movie was that most of it was shot indoors on the sets, and that in itself did not give the movie the epic proportions that normally one would expect from such classics.<br/><br/>There are many hate reviews about this movie, and I read a few of them. I found this movie to be very good  made in 1942, it was much ahead of its time in terms of scripting, dialogue, pace and screenplay. Now a days we see so many movies  but to think of the rave Casablanca would have created during world war second times, would have been enormous.<br/><br/>My salute to Martin Curtiz and Humphrey Bogart! Now I know and understand what does my boss mean when he writes and says  Here is looking at you kid! (Stars 8 out of 10)"
"Quinoa1984","10","5","8","26 August 2006"," a classic that's known to people long before they actually see the movie
","For years when I was younger I thought I had seen Casablanca, but it wasn't until I was 17 that I actually SAW the entire thing from start to finish. Before that, I had seen some of the most indelible scenes from the picture (I don't remember them all, but one had Peter Lorre, another was when Bogie is drunk in the bar after the bar is closed and Bergman's Isla goes to him and he tells her off, another was, of course, the last scene). It's when one sees all of the story put together and all of those really terrfic scenes in the club that it really does gell as being a classic. It might not be up there for me with the very great films ever like Citizen Kane or One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, but there's never a minute, a line, or a performance in Casablanca that turns out to be dull or un-watchable. It's by turns very funny in a few spurts even though it's a romantic drama of the highest Hollywood order. For some on the level of movies dealing with loves lost and found and lost again it's no wonder that this takes the cake. Even the last scene, the lines of which have been parodied God knows how many times now, still has that ring of emotion in the greatest escapist sense. It's a must-see-once kind of movie, even if you find that you don't like the movie.<br/><br/>And the cast is probably one of the best reasons to see it. It's really got the best crop of stars and character actors from Warner brothers and beyond. Bogart and Bergman have their spotlight on them here at full blast and they each deliver impeccable performances in roles that aren't too unexpected, but never less than stylish and dramatic. Then there's Peter Lorre, Peter Greenstreet, and of course Claude Raines who probably gives if not his most memorable performance one of his most striking. It's rare that an actor is given such a part that really fits him and still keeps a hold on the viewer so many years later. From the story intrigue and deception and danger involving the Nazis, the heroism and sacrifice that gets involved, and at the core of it- after the club which Bogie owns- is the love triangle that gets resolved in a somber way that makes for a sensational ending. In fact, it's main goal is to be sensational, and for the most part it's truly successful, from its 'a kiss is just a kiss' song to the sweet one-liners."

","It's that kind of cynicism that makes this old-time classic endearing to a modern day audience.  ""Casablanca"" is a noirish melodrama set against the back-drop of WWII and Europeans fleeing to America by way of French Morocco. What's so refreshing about it, in spite of its classical love triangle theatrics, is that is never places romantic love on a pedestal.  It realizes that in a world of uncertainty where neutrality is the biggest crime, there are more noble things than love.  <br/><br/>This movie is sited by many critics and viewers alike as one of the top three greatest films ever made.  It's easy to see why.  It contains probably the greatest dialogue ever written for the screen. It stars two screen icons in their greatest roles and a superb supporting cast.  It's directed by Curtiz with a complete lack of pretension.  There's nothing overtly artistic about it, or any sign that anybody involved was trying too hard. Essentially this was a gathering of classy professionals who set out to accomplish one thing: make an entertaining film.  In the process, they might have made the greatest.  Unlike so many of the other classics of this period, you never have to view it ""in context"" to appreciate and enjoy it. Rock solid entertainment anchored by smart writing cleverly cast and competently directed translates well in any day and age.  Play it again, Sam, and it gets even better As Time Goes By."

","Rick (Humphrey Bogart) once lived in Paris, before World War II broke out. An ex-pat American, he now runs a cafe, named after him, in Casablanca, Morocco. Its 1942 and many folks who want to escape Hitler arrive in Morocco to look for a visa to go to the United States. Not very many are successful. So, Rick sees desperate people every day at his establishment. Most of the time he is unmoved, as for some reason, Rick is a jaded fellow. However, he does come across a pair of valuable visas when someone trusts him to hid them in his piano player Sam's instrument. Not long after, ""THE WOMAN"", Ilsa (Ingrid Bergman) comes into the place, asking Sam to play a song Rick has forbidden him to play. When he comes rushing to chastise him, he meets Ilsa. Flashing back, we learn that Ilsa had a grand love with Rick in Paris, just as the Nazis were getting closer and closer. Yet, when they made plans to escape on a train, Rick was jilted on the platform. No Ilsa arrived. Now, will Rick learn why this happened? Yes! Ilsa had a huge secret which comes spilling out, only to make Rick hurt all over again. In the meanwhile, the Germans in town are trying to find an escaped hero of their concentration camps, Victor (Paul Henreid). He is the most wanted man in Africa and word has it he's coming to Casablanca. Can Rick be an uncaring spectator forever? This beautiful, classic film has everything, as you have probably heard. It's a fine romance, with grand passion indeed. The story is a heart grabber and the cast is superlative. Made before anyone knew how long Hitler would remain in power, and at a time when he was winning the war, one sees how all of Europe wanted to escape his clutches. If you have never taken the time to watch Casablanca, don't delay. Almost every movie fan agrees that it is a top ten listing every time."

","""We'll always have Paris. We didn't have, we, we lost it until you came to Casablanca. We got it back last night."" - Rick Blaine<br/><br/>Before, I wasn't really a huge fan of the romance genre. I don't know if it has something to do with the predictable storyline that always had a happy ending, dramatic moments that seem way too dramatic, or rehashing the same concept of love; it just wasn't my cup of tea. However, there was one film that made me change my views and to fully appreciate romance films, and that film was none other than Casablanca. It seems to have the same typical tropes that you would find in any other romance, but one thing that it did had that sets it apart from most romance films, and that is pure quality. What it ended up being is a beautiful looking and well-told story that has since became legendary.<br/><br/>Set during World War II, the story centers around Rick Blaine, an American expatriate and former freedom fighter who now runs a successful nightclub and gambling den in the city of Casablanca. His seemingly peaceful life is then interrupted when his former lover Ilsa arrives in town with her husband, a resistance movement leader who's on the run from the Nazis, and asks for Rick's help to escape to Lisbon, so they can flee to America to continue their cause. Rick is reluctant at first, due to his bitter nature and cynical views on the world caused by his and Ilsa's past relationship falling apart, but now must make a choice between his former lover and a chance for hope as the fate of the war hangs in balance.<br/><br/>For 1942, this was considered a landmark achievement in cinema history. The elegant black and white cinematography gives it a timeless feel, the story moves at a steady pace, and it's all accompanied by a beautiful and heartwarming musical score. Also, so many memorable lines that has become iconic.<br/><br/>""Of all the gin joints, in all the towns, in all the world, she walks into mine.""<br/><br/>The performances are all top notch, namely Claude Rains, Peter Lorre, and Sydney Greenstreet. However, it's the film's two leads, Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman, who really shines here. Bogart plays it with charm and has such a hypnotizing screen presence you just can't take your eyes off him. Rick, at first, may seem bitter and wants nothing to do with the world's problems, but you soon start to warm up to him when you know a bit more about him and how he once had a happy and peaceful life with the love of his life until it was taken away from him, leaving him cold and heartbroken. You can feel the same for Bergman's Ilsa; how she seemingly lost her husband, but met Rick and both lived a happy life, only to find out her husband is alive and, in haste, left Rick without explanation. You start to actually care about these two when you find out more about them.<br/><br/>Overall, Casablanca still remains as a high-water mark of the genre that gets better with ever viewing. After over 70 years, this timeless love story still stands the test of time, and I do believe I have a newfound respect for the genre.<br/><br/>""Here's looking at you kid.""<br/><br/>Final Verdict: 10/10 with.... eh screw it, the Epic Seal of Awesomeness."
"bankofmarquis","10","3","4","13 February 2019"," A Classic in every sense of the word
","""Of all the gin joints in all the towns, in all the world, she had to walk into mine.""<br/><br/>If there was only 1 movie that could be shown to show off ""classic"", old time Hollywood of the 1930's, '40's and early '50s, look no further than Michael Curtiz' 1942 classic CASABLANCA. While well known for the performances of the leads, the multiple quoted lines, Sam singing AS TIME GOES BY and the iconic ending, this film also is a time capsule to a Hollywood of another year - one that just doesn't exist today.<br/><br/>Starring the great Humphrey Bogart in an Academy Award nominated performance (inexplicably, losing to Paul Lukas for WATCH ON THE RHINE), CASABLANCA tells the tale of Rick Blaine the owner/operator of ""Rick's Place"" a bar in Casablanca, Morocco in the early days of WWII. He is world-weary, beaten and cynical and is well known as someone who can get things done (for a price) but also one who will not stick his neck out for anyone. When a couple on the run from the Nazi's (Paul Henreid, Ingrid Bergman) enter's Rick's Place, Blaine (for reasons that are revealed in the film) decides to help.<br/><br/>""Here's looking at your kid.""<br/><br/>Bogart is marvelous as Blaine, you can see every inch of his world-weariness on his well-worn, craggy face. He is perfectly cast as Rick and his mannerisms and vocal patterns depict a heaviness within. Bogart is often criticized for his lack of acting talent - nothing could be further from the truth here. He is perfectly paired with Bergman as Ilse - a former love of Rick's, who is now the wife of Freedom Fighter Victor Laszlo (Henreid). There is real chemistry between Bogart and Bergman in this film and you can tell that they are former lovers that still has a flame burning inside.<br/><br/>""We'll always have Paris.""<br/><br/>But it's not just the leads who are terrific in this, it's the ""who's who"" of character actors that make up the Supporting Cast that really brings this film to life. From Peter Lorre to Sydney Greenstreet to Conrad Veidt to S.Z. Sakall to Dooley Wilson as Sam (who plays and sings AS TIME GOES BY), all bring interesting faces and characters to Casablanca (and Rick's Place) but the standout is Claude Rains (nominated for Best Supporting Actor - losing, inexplicably, to Charles Coburn in THE MORE THE MERRIER) as Louis, the corrupt Police Captain of Casablanca who becomes an uneasy ally of Rick's. Did I say that Bogart and Bergman had good chemistry? Check out the chemistry between Bogart and Rains, there was talk of a sequel to Casablance featuring these two - I, for one, would love to have seen that buddy flick.<br/><br/>Director Michael Curtiz won an Oscar for his work - and it is richly deserved. Nary a shot is wasted on this film, each picture a rich black and white portrait. It is interesting to note that this entire film was shot in California (not Casablanca), mostly on the Warner Brothers lot, but Curtiz was able to give the look and (more importantly) the feel of the place through the sets, costumes, lighting and atmosphere.<br/><br/>But it's the words that these characters got to say that really brought home the feel and atmosphere of the time, so credit needs to go to Screenwriters Julius and Phillip Epstein as well as Howard Koch who won Oscars for their work here. This is a masterful, classic work. One that stands up to this day. If you haven't seen this film in awhile, do yourself a favor and check it out - you'll be glad you did.<br/><br/>""Louie, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship.""<br/><br/>Letter Grade: A+<br/><br/>A rare 10 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)"

"EqbalAnwari","10","3","4","29 January 2014"," The movie that sort of saved my life
","The purpose of writing this commentary is to solely state that the Writer in no way intends to compare Casablanca to any other movie in the history of motion picture; for the work is not only the pinnacle of Michael Curtiz career but also stands as a magical masterpiece in Twentieth Century Cinema.<br/><br/>I hope I have the criterion to write a justifiable and unbiased review because this Movie is very special to me and I try not to become emotional when writing about this iconic monumental work. <br/><br/>Considering the fact that there's nothing new to be said about Casablanca, I wonder where to start; probably from Rick's (Humphrey Bogart) philanthropy, Ilsa's (Ingrid Bergman) reciprocation—well reasoned and timely— her grace and heroism, the Battle of Anthems (German National Anthem vs French National Anthem), friendship, love, sacrifice, gallantry, patriotism, or plethora of amazing supporting actors such as Paul Henreid, Dooley Wilson, Claude Rains etc. <br/><br/>Michael Curtiz surpasses in telling his story masterfully, directing every single actor in brilliant and indelible performance of a life time, illustrating principles and inspiring his audience to think. The writers and the Director truly outshine themselves with the phenomenal multidisciplinary story of humankind. <br/><br/>There's so much to grab onto with a remarkable film like this; say the soothing music for example--as time goes by--or the memorable dialogue: <br/><br/>We'll always have Paris. We lost it until you came to Casablanca. We got it back last night. When I said I would never leave you. Here's looking at you kid. Are you one of those people who cannot imagine the Germans in their beloved Paris? It's not particularly my beloved Paris. Can you imagine us in London? When you get there, ask me! I wasn't sure you were the same. Let's see, the last time we met... Was La Belle Aurore. How nice, you remembered. But of course, that was the day the Germans marched into Paris. Not an easy day to forget. No. I remember every detail. The Germans wore gray, you wore blue. Play it, Sam. Play ""As Time Goes By."" Oh, I can't remember it, Miss Ilsa. I'm a little rusty on it. I'll hum it for you. Da dy da dy da dumb, da dy da dee da dumb... The best movies are ones that touch the soul. It takes a movie like Casablanca to touch the soul. The only other movie I have ever seen that influences me as strongly is The Shawshank Redemption. Both movies leave me feeling influenced for having watched them; they have the power to inspire people and therefore I certainly say both pictures are neatly perfect organism. <br/><br/>But just suffice to say that in addition to watching Casablanca habitually, I also tend to watch it on the following occasions: When I see or hear cruelty or crises anywhere in this—according to the movie, crazy—world. When I decide to travel to places not being recommended by my family or friends. On the eve of Eid and New Year's Day. Every-time when I am down or empty, or whatever they call it.<br/><br/>Finally, this timeless classic deserved not only three Academy Awards but definitely the remaining five nominations that it lost unjustifiably."
"donuthaters12","10","3","4","2 July 2013"," Curtiz's Magnum Opus
","A film that is regarded as a classic from most but does it hold up for me? Definitely. Michael Curtiz is the director of Casablanca, who has done a mountain full of films including The Adventures of Robin Hood and Mildred Pierce. I came into this with high expectations, even in my subsequent viewings, as it has an established cast, a well known composer, a prominent director and an experienced cinematographer. The film is definitely excellent but some elements, due to nitpicking, sinks this film a little.<br/><br/>The screenplay is developed by the Epstein brothers who had a reputation at their time, and with this project they seem to be in the top of their game. The film's story is packed, exploring a love story, a rebellion and the life of a citizens or immigrants in Casablanca. The film is generally well known for its love story but that wasn't the area that hooked me as I felt it was dragged by it's melodrama. The shifty and uneasy life in this desert city is what kept me hook and it dominates the first half of the film. It is from the start that the film establishes the importance of the city as a character along with the leading actors. The first and start of the second act is dominated with humor as a break from the main storyline which held my interest. I do not hate the love story but I just feel it doesn't hold up with me as compared to the more later love stories in Hollywood, Annie Hall, Vertigo and Beauty and the Beast. Then again, this is a product of its time and I can't frown upon it too much just because of that.<br/><br/>This is the only film I have seen of Curtiz's work but it isn't the only one I am aware of. He is an underrated director and one of the hardest working. With Casablanca, he just got hold of a fantastic script which got the general public to really notice him. Curtiz wanted this film to move quickly but also giving key moments in exploring the relationship between Bogart and Bergman's characters.<br/><br/>The year before Casablanca, Arthur Edeson did the cinematography for The Maltese Falcon and in that film, Edeson used shadows well and using lighting to create the mood of the scene. He brings it back here but more. This film is dark, for the most part as most of the intimate scenes took place indoors and at night. Shadow casts on scenes with Bogart and Bergman but at the same time not overshadowing the actors, especially Bergman's beautiful face as her beauty and vulnerability expressed by her face as both are important components of Ilsa. Edeson and Curtiz always have the camera moving, whether it is inside Rick's club or outside in the streets of Casablanca. It keeps the film at a pace that doesn't feel stationary and gives us a sense of exploration of the setting. This pace is also supported by great editing. In intimate moments, Curtiz really wants Edeson to have the camera get close on the actor's faces to not only have us focus on it but to create that sense of intimacy and closeness. Casablanca still has great photography, even in this day and age, and is an important piece in making it an iconic film.<br/><br/>Max Steiner was nominated in 1939 for his iconic work in Gone With The Wind and he was also nominated a few years later for score in Casablanca. His work here in Casablanca is definitely something to be remembered by fan when remembering this film. This should have been an area where it definitely should have won the academy award but sadly it lost to The Song of Bernadette.<br/><br/>For a film focused on the love story and is this intimate requires actors that bring that chemistry in order to create a memorable performance. Bogart and Bergman definitely work well together but I felt that Bogart is a little too old for Bergman. I would rather have the age of Bergman's character be nearly level with Bogart's and replace her with an older actress, but would the film still be regarded as a classic if the casting choices were different? I think so and I am only nitpicking. Both Bogart and Bergman bring it their all, even if the script is a little melodramatic they make it work for the most part. I definitely enjoyed Bogart's embodiment as this stoic and tortured character who distances himself from letting people in. Bergman has the more overly dramatic lines but she still delivers by showing emotion and care for Bogart's character. As soon as she was introduced in the film and meets Sam (Dooley Wilson), you can see that pain and sorrow rising to the surface. The supporting cast are fine and are either used for plot tools or comedic relief. The actors giving comic relief, especially Claude Reins, had me smiling every time they say something witty.<br/><br/>A film that definitely still holds a strong place in this day and age and is regarded as one of the greatest films ever made. It is a fascinating story of a love story and an interesting take on the life of Casablanca during the second world war. It has its flaws but it's overshadowed by its strengths. Casablanca is definitely worth your time and demands repeated viewings."
"v-colarusso","10","3","4","4 May 2013"," The perfect movie
","Casablanca is a classic that defines film at its greatest. This has pretty much become common knowledge. The film has many dimensions inside its story. The romance between Rick and Ilsa is unique and fantastic, but this film is much more than a love story. It's a story of redemption, glory, and enlightenment. The social implications in the film are very relevant for the time period its in. The script is one of the best parts of the film by far. The dialog is beautiful and poetic. As much as auteur directors are well-respected and usually more liked than directors with no distinct flare, Michael Curtiz directed some wonderful films without the audience being aware of his direction."

","To view the entire review, please visit us at www.TheMovieFrog.com <br/><br/>So, what do you write about a film that has been discussed and lauded for seventy years? Is it a timeless classic about love, loyalty, honor, and sacrifice or the greatest piece of corn-pone pro-war propaganda ever visited upon the American public? Well, the answer is yes...and yes. It is all of those things and more.<br/><br/>It is, first and foremost, a classic story of love and sacrifice, almost biblical in the way that it is layed out. Lazlo is the Christ- like figure. He has sacrificed everything: his safety, his freedom, and the purpose of his life to the cause of inspiring others to rise up and fight the Nazis. The only sacrifice he will not make is leaving behind the woman that he loves. Ilsa is his inspiration and the thing that keeps him going.<br/><br/>In turn, Lazlo's example of ultimate sacrifice inspires others to sacrifice for the greater good as well. His ability to inspire is demonstrated most dramatically and obviously in the scene where he leads all the patrons of Rick's in song. You can see in the faces of everyone joining in all the pain, fear, and uncertainty of living in a world turned upside down fade away to be replaced by a greater sense of pride and purpose. It is a very powerful moment in the film. However, this man's greater power is in how he impacts and inspires individuals from Ilsa, to Rick, to Renault. Rick has every reason to despise the man, yet it is not just Ilsa that leads him to break precedent and have a drink with the couple.<br/><br/>Is the film a little corny? Well, yes, but only in the best tradition of the time. The dialog is fantastic, but when every other line is a zinger, it does stretch believability a bit. No city has ever been populated by that many people who are that witty that much of the time.

","What can you say about Casablanca? I'm serious. What can be said about it? It's one of the greatest films of all time and everybody already knows it. This movie is so perfect, that it actually brings tears to my eyes. The acting, the characters, the story, the quotes, the humor, the drama, the atmosphere; everything is just perfect. This is what classics are made of. Picking my favorite thing about this movie is almost impossible because everything goes together hand in hand. But if I had to pick 2 things that make this movie great, it would have to be the two main characters, and the world the movie transports you to. First of all, the two leads. Humphrey Bogart is the man. He's always the man. I've never seen a movie where he wasn't the man. Why is he considered the ""Greatest Actor of All Time""? Because he's Humphrey Bogart, that's why. I think Humphrey Bogart perfected the concept of an ""imperfect hero"". From the very beginning, you see that people would die for him, but he wouldn't do the same. He claims to be neutral, but you're never sure which side he's really on. He's so calm and mysterious, but his decisions are based mostly on his unpredictable emotions. He has such a presence to him, but you're constantly wondering if he'll do the right thing in the end. Ingrid Bergman is also amazing playing opposite of Humphrey Bogart. Just like Bogart, she is very mysterious, and you want to know more about her. She also goes above and beyond the typical 1940s female performance. She gets so into the role, it may actually be the most emotional performance I've ever seen from this time period. These two are just perfect together. I love how most of the movie, we're left in the dark about their relationship. All we know is that these two knew each other at one point, and that they once had something. I love how most of the backstory can be seen in the faces of the two main actors. The movie doesn't even need that flashback scene, because you can see how important these two are to each other just by looking at their faces. The flashback scene is great, but I think it would've been cooler if the whole movie, we didn't know their history together. The last thing that I love about this movie is the world. This movie is classic Hollywood fantasy world, and it sure knows how to suck you right in. This isn't real life, it's the movie world; and that's what makes this movie so classic. Even though it has that 1940s acting, and many of the clichés of the time, it still remains timeless. It's all fun, from beginning to end. You may feel like you're watching a movie, but that's just because you are. This is what movies are all about. They're not about showing us what life is really like; they're about letting us escape to a world where life is more interesting. Like I said, this movie just defines ""classic"". The characters are unforgettable, the scenes are so memorized, and the quotes are so recognizable (it's no wonder this film may be the most referenced/spoofed/quoted film of all time). This film is so perfect, it gets better and better each time I see it. It's so classic; it kind of hurts. So bottom line.it's alright."

","Most films about WWII made during WWII are so rah-rah over the top that at midpoint you want to stand up and say ""OK, I get it already, the Nazis are eeeeeevil."" This one is different. There are bad guys - Conrad Veidt's Major Strasser who practically slithers on his belly and hisses like a snake he is so vile, guys that are so good that their teeth sparkle in the sunlight - Heinreid's Victor Lazlo, and a whole bunch of gray characters just trying to get by - the kind of guys who vote for who they think the winner is going to be in a Presidential election. Maybe these gray characters are truly out for themselves and see it as a game or a matter of survival - Claude Rains's Captain Renault, or maybe they were fighters for the good fight at one time and when karma dealt them a bad blow they became cynical - Bogart's Rick Blaine.<br/><br/>You've got a great supporting cast - Greenstreet, Lorre, Sakall, and Dooley Wilson as Sam, a guy with a rare level head who looks out for Rick and seems to see Rick's cynicism as an illness he has to be nursed through while tickling those ivories - a rare humanizing role for an African American in 1942.<br/><br/>Plus this thing defies all laws of synergy - it works on a grand scale as an entire work of art, but you can break out individual scenes and enjoy them divorced from the rest of the film, and there are great individual lines suitable for framing ""I stick my neck out for no man"" and "" I'm shocked, shocked to find that gambling is going on in here"" says Captain Renault as he closes down Rick's and stuffs gambling winnings into his pocket - this last line has almost become a metaphor for American politics and politicians.<br/><br/>Bottom line - Rick Blaine is Han Solo. Both characters were vital to the success of the films in which they starred. People always love a romance/adventure involving a talented cynical loner who ultimately joins or rejoins the good fight for the right reasons, a guy who is a bit too good to be true, and a woman who is torn between actually loving the first kind of man and feeling like she should really love the second kind of man. That is Casablanca and that is Star Wars, but Star Wars does not have Captain Renault and Casablanca does! Wow, I've always been afraid of reviewing Casablanca because I didn't know where to start, and it looks like I just did."

","I consider myself an old film buff. There are plenty of pictures from the Golden Era which I appreciate; which satisfy me; which I can stand back and really marvel at. Casablanca is too close to my heart for that. This film is too special. Films like Casablanca or It's a Wonderful Life, the emotion is so red hot that they're still alive today. They make you believe. You could say watching Casablanca is like wrapping yourself in a comfortable blanket, but blankets wear out. It's really like actually spending 102 minutes at Rick's café with the people you care about, whom you grow fonder of with each visit. That's Casablanca to me."

","This movie was by far one of the best romances that I have ever seen. It is generally not my favorite genre of movie but the raw emotion present throughout this masterpiece greatly moved me. The cinematography of this film is just absolutely beautiful. Every scene seems like it was shot less as a method of capturing a story, but more as if trying to paint a beautiful picture. The sets sometimes seem to frame characters at important moments in the plot and the heavy use of contrast to create very shadowy scenes sets the mood for a mysterious romance so perfectly that you can only call it a masterpiece. I found the acting to be masterful. The characters that the actors and actresses portrayed were done so flawlessly that i couldn't find a single character who i didn't think was portrayed beautifully. They captured the raw emotion of the characters and i almost believed that I was watching real events unfold before my eyes."

","Seeing this movie for the first time, it is easy to understand why it is a much loved classic. The mise-en-scène is superb as is the acting and lighting and camera work. Even though, as with virtually all movies, the drama factor is a bit heightened by the compression of time (story vs. movie), it flows very well. The quality of the acting makes the characters are very believable and enduring. The way Bogart was lit during his close-ups to show the lines of his face, really conveyed his emotional state and Bergman always appeared to be on the verge of tears (no doubt thanks to a special lens or camera effect).<br/><br/>While I knew the movie had been released before the end of World War 2, it didn't occur to me that actually meant the movie was in a position to predict the outcome (or to at least postulate a much hoped for conclusion). A prediction that, thankfully, was correct."

","I absolutely loved every minute of this film. So many iconic moments in this film, so many famous quotes, it's hard to believe its all in the same film. This film tells a wonderful story of a place where nobody wants to be, and everyone is trying to escape from the grip of Nazi Germany. This film does a wonderful job of portraying a place that is habitable, but hellish, where everyone settles with whatever they can get, trying desperately to get enough to get out. It also tells a beautiful love story, and helps to back up the phrase ""If you love something, set it free"". Rick must let the woman he loves leave for America with another man, so that she may escape from the hellhole that is Casablanca, and be with the man to whom her heart now truly belongs. One scene in particular that I absolutely loved was the scene in the bar, where Victor starts everyone up singing the French national anthem in order to drown out the Germans singing. There is so much symbolism in that scene alone, it is simply amazing. I could watch this movie over and over again."

","Some films are greater than the sum of their parts. According to Hollywood lore, no one who was involved in the making of CASABLANCA, one of the most iconic of American films, had the slightest idea that they were making anything more than a run-of-the-mill programmer. True, it was an A-list programmer, with A-list stars, an A-list director, and the kind of ensemble of well-known and beloved character actors filling out the supporting cast that Warner Bros fans had come to love and expect. <br/><br/>Yet despite all this, for most of the personnel involved it was business as usual; Ingrid Bergman remarked in her autobiography that the script was being written as they went along, and it was not until late in the shooting schedule that she finally knew who she would end up with, which she claimed made it confusing because she did not know from one day to another who she was supposed to be in love with.<br/><br/>Seventy years later, it seems remarkable to think that the people making this stunning film didn't realize what they had. For the finished product is one of those films that approaches perfection in the same way GONE WITH THE WIND and CITIZEN KANE did.<br/><br/>By now, I think everyone knows the bare bones of the story, which revolves around Rick's Café Américain, a nightclub and (illicit) casino in unoccupied French Morocco run by Rick Blaine (Humphrey Bogart) and involves the efforts of people trying to get exit visas to go to Lisbon, and on to the United States.<br/><br/>Casablanca is still unoccupied, but that does not mean the Nazis are not milling around, most notably one Major Heinrich Strasser (Conrad Veidt in his final film). And they are most interested in one recent arrival: resistance fighter Victor Laszlo, an escapee from a concentration camp hoping to get out of Casablanca one step ahead of the Nazis. Traveling with him is Miss Ilsa Lund (Bergman), whom we later discover is Laszlo's wife and who was briefly Rick's lover in Paris when she thought her husband was dead.<br/><br/>I don't really need to describe it any more. This is one of those films that is simply a joy to watch no matter how many times one sees it: it is beautifully shot in crisp black-and white, Michael Curtiz's direction is, as always, impeccable, and the only way to describe the cast is ""heaven sent;"" everyone fits their roles so perfectly that the movie soars like the airplane to Lisbon that represents escape from terror and freedom in the New World.<br/><br/>Bogart and Henreid have seldom been better; Bogart did not often get to show his softer side, but when he did, he showed what a great actor he really was. Henreid plays a man who is a legend throughout Europe, but he makes him completely human. And Bergman is sublime as always; her performance turned out to be pitch-perfect, and I can't decide between this film and NOTORIOUS, but she has seldom been more beautiful than she is here.<br/><br/>Surprisingly, this film does not seem to date. It is as fresh to me today as it was when I first saw it on the Late Show about forty years ago. I guess the greatest works of art are truly eternal."
"howardbrown","10","3","4","1 February 2012"," Awesome classic
","While my personal Bogey favorite is still his Sam Spade in 'The Maltese Falcon', his cynical nightclub owner, Rick, in 'Casablanca', is also a standout. Rather than some ""off the cuff"" comments, I'll quote instead from my article on Claude Rains (from March 2000 issue of CLASSIC IMAGES) that pretty well sums up the film: ""It was 1943's 'Casablanca', bustling with melodramatic wartime intrigue, that really put him (Claude Rains) in the forefront as one of the screen's smoothest character actors, almost--but not quite--stealing the film from Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman, as the uniformed Captain Louis Renault who investigates the goings-on at Rick's notorious cafe.<br/><br/>Nobody associated with the film guessed that it would become a screen classic, least of all its director, Michael Curtiz, the prolific WB director to whom it was just another assignment. It went on to win the Oscar for Best Film of 1943 with an award for Curtiz' taut direction.<br/><br/>Oddly enough, the film's memorable airport ending was written and conceived just shortly before filming wrapped up, with neither Bergman nor Bogart knowing whether or not she would leave him for husband Paul Henried. Wartime audiences loved the film. Sydney Greenstreet, Conrad Veidt, Victor Francen and Peter Lorre all gave sterling performances and Rains was again nominated for Best Supporting actor."" And by the way, I disagree with a former comment indicating the black and white photography of this film was primitive as compared to today's. Incredible nonsense!! As a matter of fact, the film's black and white cinematography was nominated for an Oscar! Ingrid Bergman was at the peak of her radiant beauty in this one--and Bogey was firing on all six cylinders. Great chemistry! As time goes by, we still have 'Casablanca'..."

","The Classics Tour: Part 1 ""Casablanca""<br/><br/>I thought I was a movie geek but then realised I had not seen hardly anything pre 1960 - I'm about to change that. First stop Casablanca. <br/><br/>What first struck me about Casablanca was the script, sharp and witty at times and include more classic lines that you could erm... well lots of classic lines. <br/><br/>Yes many lines from this film have been said time and time again and are part of our culture now. The final lines Bogie utters to the lovely Ingrid Bergman before she leaves I had heard before and I hadn't seen the film! <br/><br/>Next Humphrey Bogart. He's a really cool guy and his performance in this movie is pitch perfect I aim to watch some more of this mans movies. <br/><br/>Casablanca surprised me I must admit. The ending is brave indeed and contributes to its legendary status of that I have no doubt. Any ending where the lead doesn't get the girl, where the love rival is as brave if not braver just adds layers to an already great story with such a crackling script. <br/><br/>Its hard to recommend this film as many sadly would not get over its age. To be fair it has taken me a while to get round to appreciating old films but there is a whole gold mine out there and I can't wait to get stuck in. <br/><br/>I am delighted to admit for me personally Casablanca lived up to its reputation."
"hitchcockthelegend","10","3","4","19 September 2009"," You must remember this...
","Are my eyes really brown?<br/><br/>Casablanca is one of those films that needs no introduction - or in truth - any more in-depth dissection as to its worth. Over the years it has become one of the most quoted ever pictures (sometimes wrongly), and in reality it's arguably more iconic than it is a work of art. Although a truly ""A"" list production for 1942, fact is nobody in and around the film expected it to be anything other than a good piece that will put bums on the seats in the theatres. Solidly received on release and riding in on the wave of the Allies inroads into North Africa, Casablanca steadily overcame the much discussed production troubles (the script was practically rewritten daily) to be where it is now, one of the most loved film's of all time.<br/><br/>I wouldn't mention Paris, it's poor salesmanship!<br/><br/>So what is it about Casablanca that makes it so cherished and adored by each and every generation?. I just know that each time I view it (yearly) it's like falling in love again, each viewing brings a new and emotionally driven fulfilment. Tears flow, sad ones and happy ones, an overriding feeling that romantic idealism isn't dead, to which Casablanca becomes my personal myth buster. Thematic redemption brings a joyous reward, even as our daydreams about lost chances and lost loves hangs heavy in and around Rick's Café Américain. Everything about Casablanca is right, from the flawless direction (Michael Curtiz) to the iconic music, and of course the magnificent characters that are brought to life by the incredibly tight and effective cast. It may not be the greatest film of all time, but to me, and those who let it into their lives, it's one of the best friends anyone could ever hope to have. 10/10"

","Hollywood(land) never made a better film, and I strongly believe that they never will. This film started as a flawed small film that the star (Bogart) hated, saying ""the situations are ridiculous."" Adapted from a play that is now little known, the screenplay, courtesy of the Epstien twins and is often regarded as the greatest ever. <br/><br/>As well it is peppered with famous scenes, such as the flashback and airport, backed by excellent sets, powerful screenplay with great lines tossed around casually, and stupendous acting from Bogart, Bergman, Greenstreet, and Rains. To say that this is Bogart's strongest performance would be difficult, considering the versatility proved by him in Treasure of the Seiarra Madre, but Bogart was born to play this part, which contains the romantic hero, the sad drunk, the lonesome drifter, and the devil-may-care noir hero. His acting is genius, a stream of forlorn faces, emotionless reactions, excellent deliverance of lines, and confident movements, all of which is outlined in the waving, shimmering distortion of the smoke from his cigarette.<br/><br/>To sum it up, the best romance ever, the best American movie ever, the best actor ever delivering his best performance, reading the best screenplay ever, all work together to be one of the most beloved of all movies."

"classicsoncall","10","3","4","5 October 2005"," ""Everybody comes to Rick's.""
","""Casablanca"" has been my favorite movie for the past thirty years, and each annual viewing further cements that standing. For me, it's the perfect film, with perfect characters, locales, action, romance and dialog. In fact, it is the most quoted movie ever, including a line that was never even uttered (Play it again, Sam).<br/><br/>It's hard to imagine that during the studio days of the 1940's, ""Casablanca"" was just one more movie being pumped out a week at a time by Warner Brothers. The story itself, based on a stage play ""Everybody Comes to Rick's"" went through continuous rewrites, even as filming was under way. Fortunately, the vision of a handful of gifted artists ultimately found it's way on screen, with a cast as colorful and star studded as any before or since. Even the music, composed for the film by Max Steiner is perfect, dominating the Paris flashback scenes of Rick and Ilsa's fleeting romance.<br/><br/>Now picture if you will, the original contenders for the three acting leads in the film; Dennis Morgan for Victo Laszlo, Ann Sheridan for Ilsa Lund, and George Raft or Ronald Reagan for the part of Rick Blaine. If that had actually occurred, the result may well have wound up in obscurity, but instead, Warner Brothers went out of their way to hire on Ingrid Bergman, on loan from David Selznick in return for Olivia DeHaviland. For the part of Victor Laszlo, Warner signed up Paul Henreid who was under contract to RKO Pictures. Coming off a successful on screen collaboration in ""The Maltese Falcon"", Humphrey Bogart as Rick was once again supported by Peter Lorre as the scheming Ugarte, and Sydney Greenstreet as the conniving owner of the rival gambling joint, ""The Blue Parrot"". Rounding out the major film credits, Conrad Veidt successfully sneers his way into Rick's world as Nazi General Major Strasser; and for sheer delight in a characterization, there's none to equal Claude Rains' portrayal of Prefect of Police Captain Reinault. Rick and Ilsa may have always had Paris, but Rick and Reinault have always had Casablanca.<br/><br/>The ultimate outcome of the film was not known during early film production in May of 1942. It was not until brothers Julius and Philip Epstein, brought in for their humorous wit, both got their inspiration in a single moment while driving down Sunset Boulevard - ""Round up the usual suspects"". Cleverly interjecting the elimination of the hated villain Strasser by the film's hero, the film successfully answers the question of who gets the girl. Ilsa, in love with one man but devoted to the cause of another, must resign herself to the fate entrusted to Rick the night before - ""You have to think for both of us, for all of us"".<br/><br/>Even world events conspired to help ""Casablanca"" achieve it's unparalleled success. Originally to be released in June 1943, Warner Brothers' dedication to the war effort was matched by the Allied landing in North Africa in November 1942, in Casablanca. Shortly after on Thanksgiving Day 1942, the film opened in New York following a wildly enthusiastic pre-screening. And in a well timed follow up, the general release date of January 23, 1943 coincided with a conference between President Roosevelt and Prime Minister Churchill in Casablanca.<br/><br/>""Casablanca"" cemented Humphrey Bogart's reputation as a romantic leading man, and made Ingrid Bergman a very popular star. Though each would continue on in highly successful careers, they would not appear in another film together, and that's probably for the best. Both artists achieved their master work in ""Casablanca"", and how do you top a perfect?"

","Ah, Casablanca...everyone's second favorite movie!  On the recent DVD commentary, Ebert remarks that he's never heard a bad review of this film. I think he's asking for it there, because I've certainly heard some negative comments in my time, but usually these criticisms come from the sort of people who have a seizure the moment they're forced to watch something in black-and-white.  So, we can disregard their opinions then!  Every movie lover seems to like Casablanca, and that kind of almost limitless appeal is certainly remarkable.<br/><br/>I consider this movie a triumph in the name of good screenwriting.  The directing and production values are certainly fine, for their time, but it's the great LINES that everyone remembers; yet Hollywood still rarely acknowledges the key role that writers play in movie-making, preferring instead to pump up the myth that directors are the sole creative forces that drive production (I'm not denying directors' importance here - merely arguing that it is perhaps exaggerated, as this movie's classic status indicates).<br/><br/>My favorite thing about Casablanca?  Strangely, it's Claude Raines, who is simply so funny and seedy that he sticks in my mind every time I watch it. I love him, but because he's such a sleaze, I feel uncomfortable for it; in many ways, he's the most morally ambiguous part of the movie!  Of course, Bogey rules too, and the supporting cast contains two of the greatest character actors...well, ever.

"jacobhunt6","7","4","6","2 May 2019"," A classic that ALMOST stands the test of time
","Casablanca is one of the gems of the 1940s that is so far ahead of its time in terms of cinematography that one can scarcely believe it is not a mock black-and-white classic made up to 50 years later. Joining the realms of Citizen Kane and It's a Wonderful Life, this is one of the early pieces that evolved into what we know cinema to be today.
A cliched and simplistic plot aside, Casablanca features some of the most well-known dialogue in the world of film up to 70 years after its release. It is a marvel of screenwriting and cinematography that has stood the test of time.
What makes it all the more fascinating to watch is the depiction of World War II themes in a film that predates the Nazi surrender, granting us the perspective of Western artists in the midst of wartime who were unsure whether victory or defeat awaited them, and when. The idea of war gains a more sinister and hopeless tone in this context.
Casablanca, however, does fall victim to some elements of the story that struggle to stand up to today's standards in an industry that produces wonderful films by the dozen. Cliché is the primary word that comes to mind, and while Casablanca outdates many films that follow the same tropes, it certainly did not invent the romance genre, and it does little to stray from the often cringeworthy tricks of the romance-writing trade.
It also struggles in terms of pacing, often feeling like the story is meandering towards a conclusion with little causality or flow.
Nonetheless, the cinematography is an absolute marvel, and the performances of 1940s megastars Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman are typically magnificent. Casablanca is worth a watch to enjoy the roots of the film industry we see today and some of the pioneering storytelling that defines the way artists continue to produce wonderful cinema."

","CASABLANCA is a movie about love and virtue, heart and mind.<br/><br/>As time passes this movie gained the name of one of the biggest Hollywood movies of all time. Overall, I wonder what's so special. Average war drama characteristic of that period on the one hand and the perfection of the relationship of film segments from the other side. When all gather and take away, I find myself thinking that the Casablanca is damn good movie. Heartbreaking, great war drama thanks to its spirit of moderation and memorable roles. Great film about humanity and cynicism in the war-torn North Africa. The average movie, but probably remarkable human story. Here and there, there is a certain lack of logic and a lack of cohesion, but the action is smooth, clear and fast so it's almost impossible to notice. The plot, or the outcome at the end of the film is simply magical. It's risky, sad or politically unacceptable. So many tears and emotion, and yet the end is relaxing happy. I think the film would be even better if he had not had to deal with censorship. Music and cinematography are really impressive.<br/><br/>Humphrey Bogart as Rick Blaine is bitter, cynical American expatriate. Features are there for a reason. Compassion, romance and sentimentality come with a story The focus is on Bogart's character, but that does not diminish the fact that it is a great performance.<br/><br/>Ingrid Bergman as Ilsa Lund at its best and the strongest role. She is the mistress and faithful wife at the same time. Her appearance in the film is captivating. Tearful eyes while she accepts the voice of reason and at the same time resisting his heart is impossible to forget. <br/><br/>The chemistry between the main actors is incredible. Although the stage lights shining Bogart and Bergman, a whole range of supporting characters is simply extraordinary, and among them leading Claude Rains in the role of the charming, corrupt French captain.<br/><br/>Casablanca is a great blend of melodrama, intrigue and humor. The scenario is naturally repaired, but not bad. Uncertainty, acting and dialogue are unforgettable. Personally, the most important that this film in no case can be linked to a particular war propaganda."

Each shot in each scene was carefully composed and mathematically balanced, there was a symmetry to shapes and buildings and the way in which they were captured. The lighting was incredibly clean and succinct, objects were so smooth and defined I couldn't believe my eyes. I also think the camera movements like quick zooms or when the camera moved up to a character, or shots like of the entire club were revolutionary and you can definitely see the influence of the camera work in later films. I feel like this is the film or one of the films in which our cinematic history transitions into the modern period with acting and camera-work the kind that were used to, the film strangely didn't feel old to me it looked and flowed like it could have been made yesterday. The plot itself isn't bad, it's suspenseful and exciting and interesting, Bogart and Bergman are talented actors but Bogart stood out to me the most.

","If ever a film deserved to be considered a classic then this is it, even if you haven't seen it before you'll recognise much of the dialogue; it is probably the most quoted, and misquoted, film of all time. Humphrey Bogart is excellent in this career defining role as bar owner Rick Blaine who has come into possession of two ""letters of transit"" which guarantee the holders unhindered passage out of Casablanca. He has these as Ugarte, the man who asked him to look after them, was captured by the Vichy French police before he could get them back. Ugarte had been planning to sell the documents to Victor Laszlo, a Czech nationalist who is fleeing from Nazi occupied Europe to the United States via neutral Portugal. Things are complicated by the fact that Laszlo's wife Ilsa had a relationship with Rick before the fall of Paris and he never really got over her.<br/><br/>Right up until the end we don't know what Rick will do, perhaps he will let Victor and Ilsa have the letters, perhaps he will let Victor have them on condition that Ilsa stays with him or perhaps he will betray Victor and leave Casablanca himself with Ilsa. Bogart isn't the only great performance; Ingrid Bergman is fantastic as Ilsa, there is a real chemistry between her and Bogart, Claude Rains is great as the French policeman who's loyalty is likely to change depending on who he thinks is likely to be the most use to him and Paul Henreid's restrained performance as Victor Laszlo is faultless too.<br/><br/>It is hard to say what genre this film is, it is one of the great romances, it is also a war film, a thriller and even has some subtle comedy moments. Don't be put off by the film's age, the fact that it is in black and white or that it has a U certificate, this film is a must see.

For me, the first half or so of Casablanca was remarkably uninteresting, although the atmosphere created by the war taking place off screen is incredibly well done. I just hope I'm not becoming spoiled by modern film, that's one of my biggest fears.<br/><br/>Casablanca is the last hope for people who can't get to Lisbon to escape from Europe as it descends into war, and because all of the dregs of European society (the people who can't afford to buy their way out) make their way by hook or by crook there, it becomes a sort of a prison where people wait for years for their chance to escape to America. <br/><br/>The movie is so famous and such an enduring classic that it's almost impossible to write a review of it without mentioning some of the memorable lines, which are so famous that they have become a part of modern lore, like ""Here's lookin' at you, kid,"" and of course, ""Of all the gin joints in the world""<br/><br/>It's hard to imagine the movie-making world in which the movie was made, but equally fascinating to learn that the people making the movie had no idea that they were making what would become one of the most popular movies ever made. It was a big movie, of course, but it was made on a relatively tight budget, which is something that I wish modern filmmakers would remember. Money has never been what makes great movies. Few people know that anymore.<br/><br/>There is an intensely romantic story in the movie, what must be the best love story in a war film ever made, and it is remarkable how convincing and unpredictable it is. During the first half of the movie, it's easy to think that you can see exactly where it's going, which is most likely the reason I found parts of the first half slow and uninteresting. <br/><br/>But soon there comes a point where you realize that you can't predict the ending. Specifically, this happens when we learn that Ilsa's (Ingrid Bergman) ""new"" love, the man for whom her romance with Rick (Humphrey Bogart  one of the biggest giants in film history) has to end, is really a good man. <br/><br/>It's a strange love triangle between the three characters, one that many people may find morally repellent, but moving nonetheless. These are real people, not movie characters, and it seems that their amazing level of realism comes across on the screen so smoothly that it's almost by accident. <br/><br/>Ultimately Casablanca is a story about painful sacrifice for the greater good, softened by the assertion that the problems of three little people don't amount to a hill of beans in this crazy world. It's fascinating to consider the reality of that statement as we hurtle through the cosmos suffering the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune. But as we try to find all the answers, it's nice to be able to look back to one of the most tumultuous times in modern history and see three people who know they have to suffer but know the reason why. So often we aren't afforded that luxury in real life."
"classicalsteve","10","4","6","5 April 2007"," Rick Makes the Heroic Choice: One of the Best Hollywood Films of All Time
","Many a-great film or theatrical play is about a character (or characters) making a monumental choice. The results of that choice may be tragic, such as Oedipus' decision to pursue the mystery of his parentage, MacBeth's resolve to assassinate his sovereign, or even when Gene decides to cause Finneas' accident in ""A Separate Peace"". The choice can also be selfless, heroic, even transcendent. Atticus Finch in ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" agrees to defend a black man that prompts ridicule by his white peers. The passengers of the doomed cargo plane in ""The Flight of the Phoenix"" determine not to lay down and die in the desert but rebuild something from the wreckage that could save them. And Rick Blaine, played by Humphrey Bogart in his most memorable role, also makes an heroic choice in the ageless and timeless American film ""Casablanca"". <br/><br/>The film is set against the potent backdrop of World War II at a small town in Morrocco, Casablanca, and the majority of the action takes place in a restaurant-bar-casino owned by Rick Blaine. Many different personages of differing background cross the threshold into Rick's: French police, German officers, Nazis, and even members of the French Resistance.<br/><br/>Rick at first appears to be a selfish loner. He even says that he ""sticks his neck out for nobody"". At yet there are hints, even at the beginning, that there is something inside of him that has concern for others. The film appears to be about how Rick sets the nobler part of himself free from the cynical veneer that he wears. In the first scenes, Rick rarely smiles. He is quick to lose his temper, doesn't expose his emotions, and appears only interested in the profitability of his restaurant-casino. A scene early on exposes the selfless part of Rick briefly, but he brushes it off and quickly re-dons his cynical persona like a worn overcoat. Victor Laszlo also begins to suspect there is more to Rick when he says that he is ""a man who's trying to convince himself of something he doesn't believe in his heart.""<br/><br/>The episode that begins to bring that part of Rick back to himself is a former lover, played with magnetic emotionalism by Ingrid Bergman, who enters Rick's place after a long absence, escorting an important leader of the Resistance against the Nazis. I believe this portrayal may be the best romantic performance by an actress in a leading role I have ever seen. While at once feminine and gentle, Bergman is also highly resolved and dedicated to her cause. She is no wall-flower by any stretch. At first Rick appears tormented by her reappearance and a flashback to their love affair in Paris cut short by German occupation affirms the reasons behind Rick's attitude toward her return. (For a movie made during the war in 1942 to adequately depict how the German regime changed peoples' lives is one of several miracles that permeate throughout Casablanca.)<br/><br/>Twists and turns throughout the story do not necessarily foreshadow the final choice that Rick Blaine makes in the end. And we find that Rick was always a hero, and every male in the world aspires to his heroism. This is one of the best reasons why, I think, Casablanca has become not only a classic but a cinematic masterpiece. We all want to make the transcendent choice that may not be best for ourselves, but best for others."

","... it totally fails to dim or tarnish this Golden movie which is, in its own way, as iconic as Citizen Kane it's near contemporary (they were released in subsequent years). Like any film fan worthy of the name I've seen it around a dozen times in re-runs and on TV and I have owned the DVD since it became available but it's a joy to see it once again - and digitally remastered with it - in its natural habitat, the big screen as it is re-released yet again and I'm particularly pleased that it marks my 800th Review on IMDb.<br/><br/>When one just thinks about it what springs to mind is how it gives the lie to those muppets who keep insisting that Film is a 'Visual' medium because it's nothing if not a continuous string of quotable lines, arguably the most of any other movie in the English language but when one SEES it again it is, in fact, a combination of dialogue and visuals. The opening sequence alone is a Masterclass in screen writing and sets up virtually everything we need to know about the subsequent events. Equally accomplished is our introduction to Rick whose opening dialogue/action confirms what we have been told about him. Another telling visual is the way Claude Rains straightens his tie when informed that there is 'another visa problem' outside his office and his 'show her in' tells us everything we need to know about him making his line to Rick 'make it ten thousand francs, I'm only a poor corrupt official', superfluous. Note also the close ups of Bogie, Bergman and Paul Henreid in the penultimate scene at the airport, conveying more than words can about this bittersweet triangle. I could go on - indeed, I'm tempted to - but I have a feeling it's all been said before and almost certainly will be again and all I can do is envy anyone who has still to see it for the first time."

","This movie can compete with the most famous and timeless love stories in history, like Romeo & Julia, the beauty and the beast, Julia Roberts and Richard Geere.<br/><br/>Always remember while you watch it: 1942. Not such a nice time for the world! Not such a nice time for romance. Not such a nice time to stand up against something. It must have been quite an effort to shoot this film during such harsh times. I mean, it's quite a political movie and the scene with the Marseillaise must have been a punch in the face of every fascist.<br/><br/>But all the political quarrels are combined with an amazing love story that hasn't lost a single ounce of its attraction or beauty throughout the years.<br/><br/>But what really made a classic out of the picture is, in my opinion, Humphrey Bogart. I consider him the man of the millennium, a guy with so much masculine attitude and yet so much feeling. It's just an eye-catching experience to see him walk and talk and, most impressive, drink. Any other actor drinks quite ordinary. It's not a big deal to empty a glass of booze. But when Bogie does it, you can feel his pain. You can feel his grief and his anger. You can feel the person behind the scene. If you ask me for the man I respect the most in movie history, it has to be Humphrey Bogart.<br/><br/>Sure, the rest of the cast does a great job as well, Ignrid Bergmann is responsible for half of the chemistry between Rick and Ilsa but well, I can only see them in the shadow of Bogie.<br/><br/>This is one of those movies, you hear so much talking about and you begin to ask what's so great about a dusty old flick, but after you've watched it, you realize what everybody was talking about. At least, that's how I did.<br/><br/>A truly timeless tale about romance with the perfect cast and probably the most memorable quotes in history. Terrific!"

Great casting (reuniting Bogart, Peter Lorre and Sydney Greenstreet, who played together so well in ' Tha Maltese Falcon', was brilliant). Absolutely one of my favorites. One of Bogart's most sympathetic characters, in one of the most quoted (and misquoted) movies of all-time. Simply fantastic movie-making from a great era in American cinema. This movie, and Bogart's character of 'Rick' most notably, are reminiscent of other great genres of American cinema of the time, like film noir and the hard-boiled detective story (of which Bogart was a mainstay at the time). Anyone who considers his or herself a fan of love stories, drama, or American cinema (or nostalgia) must see this movie. It is the quintessential 40's American movie."

","""Who thinks 'Casablanca' is the number one movie of all time?"" That is a game many play, but I refuse to play it, because I don't think it matters. I have seen many movies over the past five decades, and 'Casablanca' is one of my all time favorites. It is set in a mysterious place at a very mysterious time, and has many mysterious figures running through the story. It has war, it has friendship, it has love, it has sacrifice. All the elements combine to form an entertaining but gripping film that always seems as fresh as the first time you viewed it.<br/><br/>This is perhaps my favorite Humphrey Bogart role, as Rick Blaine the exiled American who owns and operates his own gin joint. We know he isn't totally a good man, but we also sense that inside he is not a bad man at all. Mostly he just wants to do his job and be left alone. But danger lurks at the turn of every page of script.<br/><br/>Most SPOILERS follow. The crux of the story involves Rick, Ilsa (Ingrid Bergman) and Victor (Paul Henreid). Rick and Ilsa have a history, they parted under suspicious circumstances when she failed to meet him at the train leaving town. Now she shows up with a husband that Rick never knew she had. Victor and Ilsa want safe passage to America, and Rick holds the papers that can get them there. Still in love with Ilsa, he realizes that true love will give her what she needs, and he does. Safe passage for her and her husband.<br/><br/>Casablanca has quite a good ensemble cast, with stars in their own rights Claude Rains as Capt. Louis Renault, Conrad Veidt as Maj. Heinrich Strasser, Sydney Greenstreet as Signor Ferrari, and Peter Lorre as the shady Guillermo Ugarte.<br/><br/>The DVD is superb!!"
"TheNorthernMonkee","10","4","6","27 August 2003"," There's no way to flaw this movie
","SPOILERS Possibly contained<br/><br/>Ok, Casablanca can simply be described in six words ""The Greatest Movie Of All Time"". <br/><br/>In this film we get to witness Bogart & Bergman in their best performances, in one of the greatest (if not THE greatest) love stories of all time. The way the romance develops, disintegrates, develops again & finishes on a sad note, is one of the best film plots of all time. The acting is superb, the plot is majestic, the film may be in black and white (an idea which is often sadly dated in modern society, but not in this case) but it survives & by the end of this film, possibly the most famous movie scene of all time is shown, climaxing in what can be argued as the greatest line of all time.<br/><br/>
I guess the problem with writing reviews is that it's often easy to write vast ammounts about a film you hate, but when it comes to a film you love, you embrace it to such a degree that it's almost impossible to think of anything fresh and original to write.<br/><br/>so, with that last statement in mind, let me say this. If you have never seen Casablanca, you must be mad. If you have seen Casablanca and dislike it, you must be even madder. This film is genius, pure, classical genius."
"pnagy","1","64","176","9 September 2001"," Overrated, formulaic romance
","Why is this film considered so brilliant? How can it be a classic? It is just another shallow, formulaic, cliche-laden Hollywood love-story, typical of pre-war Hollywood. For me this film is almost undistinguishable from that other 'great' romance of the time, the nauseating 'Gone With the Wind'. At least Casablanca doesn't go on for several hours. <br/><br/>The usual plot of old lovers reunited after many years, once again in some Hollywood interpretation of a gratuitous exotic location. Bogart looks depressed, Bergman looks pretty. And that's about all there is to it. No depth of thought or character. Flat, commercial acting from the leads, even flatter and more commercial direction and script. If you like old movies from the 40s, why not watch Citizen Kane? There's considerably more thought and originality there.<br/><br/>And I've never understood why people think the lines ""Here's looking at you kid"" or ""Play it again, Sam"" are *so* quotably witty."
"Benito-5","3","17","39","10 November 1999"," This is a fun movie, but it is not art.
","Who can't help but to like this film? It has a rugged, square-jawed hero, bad guys (not just Nazis, but the French who would betray their own country to the Nazis), a pretty girl (very pretty), exotic locales, and lines that everyone can recite, a la Rocky Horror Picture Show. Lots of fun. However, the fact that this is on the IMDB top 250 is sad. There are at least 250 films better than it (notice I say ""better than"" not ""that I like more,"" nor ""that you like more""). Degustibus non disputandus est. I will grant that. However, art has tougher criteria than ""I like it, and my opinion counts because I am Me!"" Casablanca is a disjointed muddle of a film. It is cliche ridden, as subtle as a ton of dynamite, and does not come close to true masterpieces of film art. Want to see a good wartime film with good heros and bad villains? See Rome, Open City or La Notte di San Lorenzo.<br/><br/>For a better, deeper critique of what is wrong with this film, I suggest reading Umberto Eco's essay on it. It is (I think), found in How to Travel with a Salmon or Travels in Hyperreality."
"le_chiffre-1","1","56","154","6 February 2010"," Am I missing something?
","So I finally got around to watching Casablanca, one of the greatest movies ever made, or so I've always heard. Does it live up to its hype? In a word, no. It was maudlin and melodramatic; Ingrid Bergman was homely, no matter how many softening effects were used in the close-ups of her face (did a rodent gnaw off the sides of her nose? To say nothing of that masculine jawbone and those underdeveloped lips...); Humphrey Bogart was about as slick and charismatic as the Hunchback of Notre-Dame; and the story was undisguised war propaganda. One would have to have the mental age of 5 to think this movie was in any way great. Watchable, yes, but not great, and certainly not deserving of being on the IMDb top 250.<br/><br/>The movie was fast-paced, which was both good and bad: good because it would've been unbearable to watch otherwise, and bad because it didn't give the viewer time to get attached to any of the characters (which is just as well, since as I've said, it was war propaganda and so the less effective, the better).<br/><br/>Apart from a few good one-liners and patches of clever dialog, the only other positive thing I can say about it is that it was technically well made, in particular the lighting and the dynamic camera work (though I'm not personally a fan of this style of camera work, as I find it detracts from story and atmosphere). It was, however, irritating how the lighting would change whenever there was a close-up on somebody's face. What was the purpose of this? To try to mesmerize the viewer? Talk about corny.<br/><br/>If you've never seen Casablanca before, don't feel you have to, because you ain't missing much, ""kid."" It's about as overrated as it gets.<br/><br/>1 out of 10 stars, to offset the deranged ""I'm giving it 10 stars but I wish I could give it more"" reviews this cinematic mediocrity has been getting."

","I found this movie mildly engaging, and that may be a gross overstatement. The characters are cliché, with very little depth. There is nothing I could see particularly insightful or original in this movie. It was as bland as a baked potato with no garnishings, not even some salt. Perhaps this is the type of movie that people who don't like to have to think to much, like. The plot is not so bad, it had potential, but seemed to be left to wither in the hands of a weak script and somewhat inept acting. Who is Bogart supposed to be, James Bond with a broken heart? Trying to put this ultra cool James Bond character into the ""real"" world, just doesn't work for me. I never really find Bogart's character believable, so I never really connect with the character. The catch phrase lines, like ""Here's lookin' at you kid."" are as profound as Schwatzenager's ""I'll be back"". If this was an action type adventure story like Raider's of the Lost ark, I could overlook some of these things. But this movie seems to be first and foremost a love story. And in that sense, I think it fails. I could go on with much more criticism of this movie, but I don't want to beet it to death. It is not an awful movie, more of a very light cute little thing. But one of the greatest movies of all time??? Eeeh Gods, how can that be?!!! Perhaps Hollywood is not so off the mark when they dumb down movies for the general public."

","This movie is one big yawn after another. It concerns an illicit love affair and a lot of sitting around doing nothing for two hours. Humphrey Bogart wears a mac and smokes while various characters mooch around trying to look war torn. I fell asleep several times during watching this cheese fest and was told I never missed a thing ( except for a few characters smoking cigarettes). Also, the ending is very contrived as Bogart is dragged to the electric chair screaming and begging. The only interesting moment is the airport departure where Bogart is hanging on to the wing of the plane as it takes off shouting:"" Here's looking at you, kid!"" through the window in a vain attempt to stop her leaving. The only truly enjoyable scene in the movie.<br/><br/>Very, very overrated, Sam."

It also broke social ground, with Sam the pianist (Dooley Wilson) being one of the first black roles to be treated as (almost) an equal. Most of all, it's a film you can watch again and again.

"Brodieman808","10","5","9","13 July 2006"," THE Greatest Movie Ever Made
","Arguably the greatest film ever made. It is a classic for a reason, this film tells a great story, tells a love story and is a political commentary at the same time, all while being supremely entertaining.<br/><br/>From start to finish this movie continues to pull you in, and makes remarkable references to world events at the time. You are introduced to Rick, played by the legendary Humphrey Bogart, an American who ""sticks his neck out for nobody"" but who was fought bravely in the past against the same type of enemy the other characters are up against. This is clearly a singular personification of the history and the stance America had in 1941 prior to Pearl Harbor. Early in the story we see the keys to salvation handed over to him by Ugarte, played by Jewish actor Peter Lorre, who himself fled from the Nazi's in 1933 to come to America. Ugarte who is killed summarily early on in the story is something of a representative of the heartless horrors that Jewish refugees were telling of what was happening to Jews in Nazi Europe at the time. Rick is now the safeguard of ""letters of transit"" which play an important role and overall become a character in their own.<br/><br/>Taking place in what can only be described as purgatory we are introduced to a host of characters that need help to get out and the ones that prey on those needing that help. In this place the Vichy French, under influence of the Nazi's rule the land, and their prefect, the corrupt but still somehow noble in a way, Captain Renault, who becomes a representative of all French who wish to be free of Nazi rule, mainly because he doesn't like being told what to do more than anything. It is into this we see the great conflict as Victor Laslo, a legendary Czech freedom fighter against Nazi rule is brought into the story. Victor becomes a representative of all of Europe that needs the help of America, and as the singular American in the story, speaking for all of us he seeks out Rick, who now holds the key to Victors, and his wife's freedom. With the introduction of Victor Laslo we meet his wife Ilsa Lund, played by Ingrid Bergman, who we learn has had a past with Rick, a past that has scarred them both, but their feelings still remain. Here we see the American past with Europe personified, we have a past with that continent and most of us love that past but we want our own future and now our past love needs our help, so Rick has to come to the rescue. This relationship is summed up in one line Ilsa says to Rick ""you have to think for both of us, for all of us"" where we see the desperation and the need for salvation.<br/><br/>The climax to the movie is a masterful one, where a race to get Victor and Ilsa on the last plane out of Casablanca is taking place, where Rick has weaved a web of decit that bravely ensures they will get out alive if all goes according to plan. Prior to their escape one of the most famous monologues takes place that almost brings tears to the eyes of all who see it. And after the dust has settled Rick, the American, and Captain Renault the Frenchmen who has realigned his allegiances and saved Rick from the Nazi's walk off into the foggy night in what is ""the beginning of a beautiful friendship"" where side by side the Americans will stand with the French against the Nazi's.<br/><br/>In the end we see it as a highly critical editorial commentary made by Warner Brothers of the stance America had before entering the war. It also stands as a noble and optimistic beacon for events to come."

The music by Max Steiner is outstanding, from the sweeping haunting love theme As Time Goes By, to the excerpts of the french national anthem.

The screenplay is unquestionably one of the finest in the history of cinema, right up there with Shawshank Redemption and All About Eve, containing great memorable lines such as ""seems as though Destiny is at hand"". The performances were superlative, Humphrey Bogart giving one of cinema's greatest lead performances as the ""cynical sentimentalist"" Rick Blain. Also superb are Ingrid Bergman who positively lights up the screen as Ilsa, the young woman who breaks his heart, Paul Henreid as the fugitive husband, and Claude Rains as Captain Renault. The plot is a little complicated, but I couldn't help being impressed with the performances and the screenplay. Not to mention a timeless love story that I don't think has ever been topped.

","I thought this film was okay but not fantastic like what most other people think of the movie. Despite this, I can see why this was a huge film for Hollywood and regarded as a classic movie. In my opinion, I don't think there were enough moments that got me engaged within the movie so I couldn't give it a higher rating.<br/><br/>The film is set in Casablanca, Morocco and the main character Rick Blaine (Humphrey Bogart) owns a nightclub. This nightclub is called 'Rick's Cafe Americain' and this represents America's dominance all over the world and it signifies wherever there is American ownership, there is power. This is a example of surveillance during 1942. <br/><br/>Later on in the film we get to know Victor Laszlo (Paul Henreid) and we find out that he is in a relationship with Rick's ex Isla Lund (Ingrid Bergman), she is a French girl and to show his love for Isla, Laszlo sings La Marseillaise. I thought this was powerful as it reinforces the idea of patriotism during the time of war.<br/><br/>At the end of the film, we find out that Rick still loves his ex Isla despite her leaving him and Rick does the right thing for Isla by sending her back to France. We see that he puts people before himself because even though he loves this girl he does the right thing for her by sending her home."

","After hearing all of the hype surrounding this film my expectations were set rather high, but after i finally sat down and watched this film i was kind of let down. While this film was a bit of a let down it was still somewhat interesting to watch. This film had great acting from both the main and supporting actors who really seemed to give it there all to portray these characters perfectly but that was the only part of this movie that really blew me away. The plot was somewhat interesting but moved a little to slow in my opinion. Overall this film is way over hyped and in my opinion should not be considered on of the best films ever made."

","If you help someone that is in need not only will that person benefit from it, but you will too. Rick fell madly in love with a woman named Ilsa. Ilsa broke Ricks' heart which made Rick change. When Rick arrived at Casablanca, he bought a bar and in almost every scene, he was drinking. The way I saw it was he was trying to drink his sorrows away. Rick mainly cared about himself and he said that he does not stick his neck out for anyone and he would not help anyone out if he would get in trouble for doing so. Rick would also not get close to anyone probably for fear of getting hurt again. Rick did not socialize with others unless it was business. When people in the bar would ask to have a drink with him, they were told no because Rick did not drink with anyone. However, that changed when Ilsa arrived and she asked to have a drink with him, he sat down and had a drink with Ilsa and her husband. When Ilsa came to his bar, Rick started breaking all of his rules. Rick stuck his neck out even when there was a great danger of him getting trouble and he was getting close to Ilsa again. The writing of this story shows that one person can change the way someone thinks, feels, and acts. This is a good example of a love story. Two men were madly in love with a women and one man had to let the women go because he thought it would be the right thing to do. At the end of the movie, the man let her go because he wanted her to be happy, even if it was not with him. If I were to write a love story, I would use this movie as an example because it shows that you can love someone and risk your life for them and they are with someone else. Rick was given a very valuable object at the beginning of the movie and that was some letters. The letters were very valuable and Ilsa wanted them. Ilsa wanted the papers for several reasons. First, they meant freedom from the Nazis and from Casablanca because the letters meant they could get enough money to leave to make it to America. Second, they meant mobility because they were worth enough money for Ilsa and her husband to get on the plane to leave Casablanca. Lastly, the meant a new life in America because they were able to get on the plane to leave. In a way, Rick was like the Nazis. The Nazis were very powerful people and Rick was a powerful man. The French police told Rick that Islas' husband, Lazlo, was not allowed to leave Casablanca and whoever helped him escape would be in a lot of trouble. Rick had power because he had the papers that Ilsa and her husband needed to leave Casablanca. The Nazis sent Lazlo to a concentration camp where he was not able to leave and Rick had the power to make Lazlo not leave Casablanca.<br/><br/>In the love stories I have seen, there is one person that sacrifices their happiness for the happiness of the person they love. Rick was still in love with Ilsa even though Ilsa was married to Lazlo. Rick could have made Isla and Lazlos' lives miserable by not helping them but, he wanted Ilsa to be happy so Rick helped them. Rick ended up losing his love again and risking everything he had and possibly his life. However, what Rick did for them made them happy."

","""Here's looking at you, kid.""<br/><br/>""This could be the beginning of a beautiful friendship.""<br/><br/>""I don't stick my neck out for nobody.""<br/><br/>""Round up the usual suspects.""<br/><br/>""I'm shocked, SHOCKED, to find that gambling is going on in here!""<br/><br/>""Did you abscond with the church funds?""<br/><br/>""We'll always have Paris.""<br/><br/>These are just some of the lines from this movie which have made their way into our lexicon. Of course, I did save the most famous one for last: ""Of all the gin joints in all the towns in all the world, she walks into mine.""<br/><br/>Welcome to ""Casablanca"", regarded as one of the most popular movies of all time. I know, I know, everybody says that, but it's true. When people criticize movies today, Casablanca is usually one of the ""go-to"" films they turn to when they say ""They don't make 'em like they used to.""<br/><br/>And, they would be correct.<br/><br/>Ask any woman to name her top-five most romantic movies, and ""Casablanca"" will likely show up on her list. And when it comes to movie romances, men's eyes usually glaze over at the mere mention of them. Well, I am here to tell you there is plenty to keep a man's attention in this film and, in the end, he may actually walk away in a non-catatonic state.<br/><br/>First, you have Humphrey Bogart as Rick Blaine, owner and proprietor of Rick's Café Americain in the city of Casablanca. An expatriated American, Rick is a cynic whose establishment is just this side of illegal, yet he manages to stay in business and make a good living at it. And besides, it's Bogey!<br/><br/>Then there's Claude Rains as the local chief of police, Louis Renault. Captain Renault is slippery as an eel, especially when it comes to dealing with those in authority above him. He's also inquisitive, intelligent, and hypocritical.<br/><br/>Up next are the Nazis. Morocco was French territory in 1941, and the Germans occupied France during that time. Here, they are presented as ambitious warmongers bent on world domination (and that would be correct). With the Nazis around, there is an inbred conflict from the get-go, as Casablanca is portrayed as a hub for the French Resistance during World War II. I should also point out that this is the earliest American film I know of that not only uses the term ""concentration camp"" by name, but it also suggests that people have died within them.<br/><br/>Throw in a murder or two, and you have the makings of a good film-noir. Okay, so ""film-noir"" officially sprang up after World War II, but it still feels like one. The camera angles, shot composition, lighting, use of shadow, a brooding leading man (Bogart), and a tormented femme fatale (Ingrid Bergman) all add up toward the formula.<br/><br/>All of this is capped off with sardonic wit and tight drama, signs of a well-written script (which, interestingly enough, was cobbled together right up to the very end of filming). Also, the timing of this movie is what made it such a hit. It ranks right up there with ""On the Waterfront"" (1954), ""The China Syndrome"" (1979), ""Guess Who's Coming to Dinner"" (1967), ""In the Heat of the Night"" (1967), and ""The Deer Hunter"" (1978) in terms of topicality within the society of the day.<br/><br/>So, you men out there, when your woman suggests watching ""Casablanca"", throw some popcorn in the microwave. Trust me, you'll be able to sit through this one!"

","Ah, ""Casablanca.""  Is there a line from the film that hasn't become a cliche?  That's not a criticism of the movie.  If anything it's the reverse. What greater compliment to a film screenplay can a film audience make than so completely absorbing every word of it into its common cultural consciousness?<br/><br/>It took me a long time and multiple viewings before I warmed up to Michael Curtiz's 1943 film (by some accounts a 1942 release).  I'm not particularly a fan of either Ingrid Bergman or Humphrey Bogart, and the filmmaking techniques didn't strike me as anything inventive or unique and they still don't.  At best, ""Casablanca"" exists as an example of the classic Hollywood style of filmmaking working at its slickest and most polished.<br/><br/>But then on about the fourth viewing, it struck me.  The people who love this movie don't love it for the striking visuals or the daring narrative or any of the elements that make, say, ""Citizen Kane"" such continual fuel for film discussion.  People still love ""Casablanca"" for coming out at exactly the right moment in our cultural history, and somehow it's retained that ""right place, right time"" allure.  America had been involved in World War II for at least two years by the time of this film's wide release, and many women had seen their men leave to face uncertain futures.  So no wonder a film with such an intense nostalgic glow about it would strike a universal chord.  No wonder the forbidden romance between the Bergman and Bogart characters seemed so instensely poignant.  And no wonder the patriotic, ""do whatever you must for the good of the cause"" propaganda (for let's call it what it is), seemed so stirring (and still does).<br/><br/>Is ""Casablanca"" a great film?  I won't attempt to answer that, though it's not one of my personal favorites.  But any film that carries its legacy with it the way this one does can't be completely dismissed either.<br/><br/>My grade: B+"

The acting was stale, the characters were un-relatable, and the story was drug out too long. I found myself bored throughout at least 80% of it. Please don't assume that I don't like it just because it's an older film; most movies I have scene are older films, and a lot of them are far better than this one.

You never get the truth about what these characters really want from each other, nor is there any clear central point to the story.<br/><br/>It seems to me what people like about this film most is the glamour of Ingrid Bergman -- and the low key cool act of Humphrey Bogart.

Yes, I said the 30's, because Casablanca is much more a product of that decade than the 40's, which would deliver some truly great films. Those ""funny"" characters make Casablanca more like a menagerie than something with an intelligent plan. Humphrey Bogart - a great actor in The Caine Mutiny, Treasure of the Sierra Madre, and even Petrified Forest...but not here. Totally unbelievable and unconvincing as a romantic lead. He doesn't even deliver as an anti-hero in this worn-out, overrated piece of pre-WWII propaganda. Ingrid Bergman - a beautiful lady, and a hundred times better in everything else she did...but a cartoon here. Claude Rains - typical 30's supporting role...goofy, but with a big heart; goes ""straight"" in the end. 30's nonsense.<br/><br/>The story - lame and predictable. Why did people love Casablanca? Because it stirred their patriotism at a time when Germany was threatening to bulldoze Great Britain and everywhere else. It never was a great, much less an exceptional film.<br/><br/>Nowadays, Casablanca coasts along on its shaky reputation, held up as a ""masterpiece"", but smelling like the aged soaper that it is."

","I'm sad to say it, but I found this film to be extremely boring. In my opinion, it dragged on. It did it's job in making you dislike the oppressive Nazi soldiers, and making you want Rick and Ilsa together; but as for holding my attention, it didn't do so. Watching Rick develop as a character was nice to see, as he was very monotone in the beginning and his feelings came up more and more by the end. The best part was the very end, where Rick shoots the German soldier and Renault lets him get away with it. The scene was put together smoothly and really made you like the characters.Another good compilation of scenes were the flashbacks between Rick and Ilsa. Rick's personality was completely different from that of the present. When he was stood up, it made you feel bad and then completely understand his cool composure through he rest of the film. He's a smart guy, and under his hardened exterior lies a loving and caring person."

","...what does that mean? A timeless classic. I am told that there are many of them out there in the world of film, and of course, this is all based upon opinion. I saw Casablanca many years ago before seeing the many films I have today, and it was OK. It made me think of Indiana Jones if he settled down and ran a club, but only because the film is based during the same era. Now that I have recently watched it again after multiple viewings of..let's say...Fanny and Alexanrda, Citizen Kane, The 400 Blows, Beauty and the Beast (1946), and even Gone With the Wind, I still don't get why this film is ranked higher than these other films by people.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, I'm not a hater of it, but I just think it's a bore, and that is my opinion. Humphrey Bogart has never really done anything for me, not even with the countless viewings of The African Queen I had to sit through every time they had it on TV while growing up. I feel that because of Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman being in it automatically gives people the right to dub it a ""timeless classic"". When I think of a what that means, ""timeless classic"", I think of the re-play value that the film has. Of course the acting is good, and the cinematographry is wonderful, it's the mood and tone of the film that brings me down.<br/><br/>So if you have not seen this, please do have a watch. You might fall in love with it and you might not. I'm sure I will see it again someday down the road, and maybe my attitude on it will have changed."

","... this must be the one where the romance of everything appeals to me the most. You have the passionate but doomed re-acquaintance, set against a time when to even look a day into the future was uncertain. Best of all, the guy I'm supposed to relate to from this couple is the boozing, sarcastic incarnation of Humphrey Bogart! Part of me feels like you haven't suffered unless you're someone who's destined for the gutter and bitter at how the world has turned out. An attitude that comes from reading too much pre-18th century poetry, no doubt... (Further insight may also be found in my review of ""The Libertine"".)<br/><br/>Anyway, all of the most important details within the story seem to have been collected especially for my benefit, although I guess I'm not the only one, since the film continues to be popular right up to the present day. Truth is, this is a movie for anyone who inwardly looks upon themselves as a cynic with a heart of gold.<br/><br/>The question I ask myself though is: Would I be brave and selfless enough to give up my one true love for the sake of humanity in general? I don't think so, although I still cling to memories of a faded love, I have no pretensions of being so noble about it. That is why we have indelible movie-stars and characters, though - Heroes who do the things we wish we could do, and are strong enough to take the consequences of the hardest choices. Rick Blaine and ""Casablanca"" are monuments to the notion of 'doing the decent thing', and it is this quality that makes the script and performances come alive. Watching it should be a magical experience."

","Since no one reading these comments knows the plot, I'll outline it. Loner Humphrey Bogart runs a shady saloon and gambling house in French Morocco in 1942. The Nazis are closing in. The region is under the government of the French puppet government and is represented by Claude Raines. Bogart is wary of relationships. ""I stick my neck out for nobody."" Into his gin joint walks an old girl friend, Ingrid Bergman, and her husband. They're still in love but Bergman is bonded to her idealistic husband, a resistance hero and concentration camp escapee. Bogart is distraught. <br/><br/>A flashback reveals that they were lovers in Paris before it was occupied by the Germans. They kiss often on the screen and it's even suggested that they had premarital intercourse. Bergman finds out that her husband is still alive and deserts Bogart without explanation. The rebuff leaves him shocked -- shocked! <br/><br/>Back in the present, in Rick's café in Casablanca, it's revealed that Bogart has two unimpeachable passes out of Casablanca, which Bergman attempts to get from him, for use by her and her hero husband, at the point of a gun. But she can't shoot Bogart. Instead, she collapses in his arms. The scene dissolves. When the next scene fades in they are standing apart and conversing. I suspect another illicit interlude has taken place.<br/><br/>In the end, good prevails. Bogart and Bergman sacrifice their love for the greater good.<br/><br/>It's practically an icon of 1940s Hollywood. It has a great cast -- Bogart, Bergman, Cuddles Sakal, Claude Raines, Greenstreet and Lorre from ""The Maltese Falcon,"" Paul Henreid, John Qualen, Leonid Kinsky, Conrad Veidt from Fritz Lang's ""The Cabinet of Doctor Caligari."" It was probably the high point of Michael Curtiz's career. And it's been applauded by fans from all over the world for almost seventy years.<br/><br/>And it's not bad, either. It's just that, to the extent that it eludes my aesthetic apparatus, I guess it's because I find it no more than an interesting but strictly routine tale of the nasty Nazis, the ambiguous French, the heroic European resistance, and the cynical and embittered American who converts to the values of the Free World at the end. Bogart was to play similar roles for the rest of his career. (Cf., ""Key Largo."")<br/><br/>The very features of the film that are so consistently pointed to as its greatest assets I find kind of corny. Everybody quotes tag lines. ""The problems of two people don't amount to a hill of beans in this crazy world."" ""Round up the usual suspects."" ""Louie, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship."" I remember every detail of Paris. The Germans wore gray, you wore blue."" <br/><br/>Then there's the scene in which the Free French outsing the Germans. Is that cannon fire or is it myself I hear snoring? The movie is okay for what it purports to be, a strictly commercial, patriotic effort from Warner Brothers. There's nothing to indicate the slapdash quality of the shooting itself. (At one point, Bogart had a scene in which he stood on a balcony nodding at something below, without knowing what the something was supposed to be.) <br/><br/>I watch it more out of a sense of duty than any magnetic attraction towards an irresistible film. The schmaltz is frankly irritating. I wince, watching the tears roll down Bergman's gorgeous face, hearing Bogart's repeated, ""Here's looking at you kid."" It would be nice to think that there was more going on than what we see and hear on the surface. Somewhere between the rainy train station in Paris and the colorful desert resorts of Casablanca, couldn't Bogart have come out of the closet? Maybe he and Claude Raines were jealous of one another? Couldn't Bogart have sent Bergman off with her husband because he was more in love with his collection of ladies' undergarments? He found the local goat herds more inspiring?<br/><br/>Anything?"

The story of Casablanca is simply straightforward, not witty or twisted ( oh, are all Hollywood films stupid so they call this one witty ??? ). The acting is fine, Ingrid Bergman is great but Humphrey Bogart looks damn boring like a sleepwalker ( or did he try to be cool? ). Ah, the only memorable quote to me in this film is ""The problems of three little people don't amount to a hill of beans in this crazy world"". The others are forgettable and they may be classic because people consider this one a classic. ""Play it again, Sam"" for instance, what the hell? The line "" You jump I jump remember? "" in the blockbuster Titanic is even much better. The message? Very clear: love, sacrifice, anti-war propaganda. That's all. Not deep or complex at all.

But if that style was the best way to make films, they would still make films like that.<br/><br/>That's not to say I don't like this movie. I even understand why some people love it. It's a pleasant romantic film with some very iconic moments. For me, The Marseillaise scene is very powerful. Despite all that, this film fails to be a great piece of art in the way more challenging films like Citizen Kane, Persona, and The Passion of Joan of Arc are.<br/><br/>And that's because, despite the strong story of the film, it has very little to say. Curtiz is not interested in raising any questions, but simply telling his story and drumming up support for the war. He's also not a great director, as the movie's cinematic style is overly theatrical, without any attempt to use cinematography and editing to tell the story. The acting is (as usual) is great from Bergman, and rather cheesy from Bogart.<br/><br/>This movie is a classic, there's no denying that. But it's a classic because it's simply a good example of a style that is typical of the time. What is typical is almost never important.

","In 1942, in World War II, Casablanca is the escape route to America for a few wealthy or influential people and limbo for many others that wait for a chance to raise money and get a visa. The expatriated American and former idealistic rebel Rick Blaine (Humphrey Bogart) owns the Rick's Cafe Americain, the most famous nightclub and casino in the French Morocco's town. Rick is a bitter and cynical man that neither drinks with costumers nor involves with women, and does not stick his neck out for anyone, keeping a neutral political position in times of war. Rick has a good relationship with the corrupt French Chief of Police Captain Renault (Claude Rains), who is bribed to cover the existence of Rick's casino and protect the place. When two German messengers are killed and the valuable letters of transit in their possession are stolen, the Nazi Major Strasser (Conrad Veidt) arrives in Casablanca seeking the document and the Czechoslovakian leader of the European resistance Victor Laszlo (Paul Henreid). The Germans believe Viktor will try to buy the letters of transit and escape to America. Meanwhile Rick's acquaintance Ugarte (Peter Lorre) asks him to keep the letters of transit for a couple of hours, but is captured and killed by the police and the Germans. Later Victor arrives in the Rick's Cafe with his wife Ilsa Lund (Ingrid Bergman), and when she sees the piano player Sam (Dooley Wilson), she asks him to play and sing ""As Time Goes By"". When the upset Rick complains with Sam for playing the forbidden song, he sees Ilsa and recalls their romantic moments in Paris and the wound in his heart when Ilsa does not leave the town with him without any explanation.<br/><br/>""Casablanca"" is the most beautiful movie of the cinema history ever and the number one of my preference. I do not know how many times I have watched ""Casablanca"", but since the first time I have fallen in love for Ingrid Bergman and Humphrey Bogart and they became my favorite actress and actor. Further, I feel myself emotionally affected every time that I see this film, maybe expecting Rick to stay with Ilsa in the end. But Rick's sacrifice for love is certainly one of the reasons that made ""Casablanca"" an unforgettable masterpiece, maybe the most romantic film ever made. The sequence in Rick's Cafe with the French costumers singing La Marseillaise causes goose flesh on me  imagine in French people! The wonderful romance is disclosed through a magnificent screenplay, with memorable and witty dialogs, perfect development of the characters and the geopolitical situation of Casablanca in 1942 in a dramatic environment of war and a stunning chemistry of the leading couple. The direction of Michael Curtiz is amazing, using closes, shadows and exploring the talent of the cast at their best with the support of an awesome black and white cinematography. The music-theme is among the most well-known in the world. In the end, ""Casablanca"" is the perfect movie, and Rick and Ilsa will live forever together in my heart. My vote is ten.<br/><br/>Title (Brazil): ""Casablanca"""

","Humphrey Bogart in his preeminent role, that of the marvelously tough nightclub owner Rick Blaine, living in Algiers and sheltering refugee ex-girlfriend Ingrid Bergman and her new husband from the invading Nazis. Bogart is so ideally cast, the minute you see him on-screen in his white tuxedo jacket is a welcome sight. Bergman is somehow less interesting, and director Michael Curtiz keeps her crying all the time (usually in close-up), which, although appropriately tender and moving, becomes repetitive. The screenplay, reportedly the victim of frequent change on the set, is loosely structured and is often handled indifferently by Curtiz, who nevertheless stages some classic sequences, particularly the finale at the airport. But what does Rick mean by his line, ""I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship""? Has Ilsa's emotional devotion sworn him off women for good? Beautiful cinematography by Arthur Edeson; Max Steiner's score is used to underline everything, but Herman Hupfeld's ""As Time Goes By"" makes up for the oversell. *** from ****"
"Alex-506","5","7","16","9 January 2001"," Sorry to be a downer, but here's what I think of Casablanca.
","I do not like Casablanca.  Wait!  Before I'm burned at the stake, hear me out.  One of the problems I have with Casablanca is that it tries to exist on two different plains.  It expects us be drawn into the emotional struggle that Rick undergoes throughout the movie.  But no matter how hard I tried (and believe me I wanted to love this movie), the film failed on the emotional level.  Rick, as played by Humphrey Bogart, seemed horrifically ingenuine.  He continually spewed out dialogue which pandered, even insulted, the audience.  ""I stick my neck out for no one"", ""Rick never drinks with anyone"", etc., etc.   These lines are definitely memorable, but a capable actor could have communicated Rick's veneer of cynicism without words, and trusted the audience's intelligence to figure it out.  Indeed, it is this constantly simplistic dialogue, as well as the cardboard performance by Bogart, that continually held me back.  I couldn't plunge into the emotional power of the film as I wanted to, and indeed I began to grow annoyed by the film because it seemed as if it didn't believe its own convictions.  It seemed as if it would rather be hip than genuine.  The film is not without its strong points, definitely: the great performances by Bergman, Rains and Wilson, the surehanded direction of Curtiz, and the memorable song ""As Time Goes By"".  But Casablanca failed to draw me in emotionally, and also failed to invoke the feeling of Casablanca at that time.  Compared to great films like The Third Man (which invoked the paranoia of Cold War Vienna), Schindler's List (the closing walls of the Holocaust) and Saving Private Ryan (the chaos of war), Casablanca fails miserably in comparison.  Whenever I see Casablanca, I am always a little saddened.  It could have been a great and profound film.  Instead, it is a mediocre escapist entertainment.<br/><br/>**/*****"
"Rsacto","8","3","5","6 October 2016"," A classic wartime/noir pic & entertaining as-all-get-out despite the bad casting of the romantic leads
","I still enjoy watching Casablanca, mainly for the snappy, rapier-wit dialogue written by the amazing Epstein brothers in the first half of pic. Peter Lorre's lines as ""Ugarte"" with Bogart never fail to get a laugh out of audiences: ""You despise me, don't you?"" Bogart: ""Well, if I gave you any thought I probably would."" Truly scintillating script-writing.<br/><br/>I love watching the supporting cast members in Rick's ""Cafe Americain"" who have been indisputably reported as refugees who had actually fled Nazi-occupied Europe. When they sang ""La Marseillaise,"" the tears in their eyes were the real thing. Pretty hard to top that, especially in a film made during the early days of WWII. <br/><br/>Unfortunately, the Epsteins were given another writing assignment halfway through pic, and Howard Koch was ordered to crank out the melodramatic denouement of the yet unfinished script, written just days ahead of the actual shoot. <br/><br/>Madeleine LeBeau (featured in a brief dalliance with Bogart's Rick in pic) is easily the sexiest woman in pic (at 17 years of age, a recent French refugee herself, and quintessentially nubile). She genuinely cries like a baby as she sings her French national anthem. Few actresses ever upstaged the polished super-star Ingrid Bergman, with the extreme close-ups of her carefully posed, glowing, porcelain complexion lighting up any theater screening pic. But the slinky, succulent, petit morceau LeBeau (who was the one player, besides Claude Rains, who exuded any genuine sexual energy in pic) still managed to steal the limelight in her small, supporting role.<br/><br/>Bogart struts and grunts through pic with the same tough guy persona he uses in every gangster film he's ever been in. Imagine instead the witty and urbane Dick Powell (who breathed life into the very same ""Phillip Marlowe"" character in ""Murder, My Sweet"" that Bogart couldn't even touch in his portrayal of that private-eye in ""The Big Sleep"") as Rick, instead of the grumpy, unappealing Bogart. Powell was a former song-and-dance man who seamlessly transitioned over to dramatic roles, and he would have given a nuanced, heartfelt perf to the character of Rick. Perhaps he was unavailable, but he's the actor I would have cast as Rick. <br/><br/>Ingrid Bergman herself seems like she hasn't the slightest sexual interest in the aging, sawed-off Bogart. She also mailed in her scenes with her husband Paul Henreid, who acts as stiff as a board with Bergman, though at 6' 3"" Henreid at least didn't have to stand on an ""Apple Box"" (derisively known in The Biz as ""The Man-Maker"" in snarky filmmaking jargon) like the 5' 8"" Bogart was forced to use in order to match the the height of the towering Swede Bergman's 5' 10"" (without heels) stature. Bergman, obviously a sophisticated, blase', 30ish-looking woman, looks so far out of Bogart's league that it's almost laughable. Cary Grant was the only male lead to really ignite an on-screen chemistry in his roles with The Viking Queen.<br/><br/>Predictably, the stuffy, classically-trained, over-rehearsed Bergman didn't have a clue on how to umpire Claude Rains' constant flirtations with her. Improv was never Bergman's strong suit. The ever-playful Rains stole every scene with Bergman, who turned out to be an odd, dour casting choice indeed for the role of the young, naive woman who was Bogart's young Paris squeeze. <br/><br/>Worst of all, Bergman's crassly imperious and unmistakably condescending air in her dialogue with Sam, Bogart's black piano player, revealed her revoltingly supercilious sense of Nordic superiority. <br/><br/>The fiery, spectacular Parisienne Madeleine LeBeau would have been a much more believable and tantalizing choice for the ""impressionable young girl"" that the worldly, independent Scandinavian Bergman ridiculously claimed to be when she fell for and married Henreid's heroic resistance-fighter character. <br/><br/>If only the story had flashbacked to Bogart in his earlier Paris romance with the mouthwatering, patently underage LeBeau, maybe it would have infused pic with the Hays Code-busting, steamy sexual energy that it needed to propel it above its predictable, corny, propaganda-infused climax. Kind of like what Bogart actually did in his real life, when he gave his much older wife Mayo Methot the heave-ho to marry the beautiful 19 year-old Hollywood MAW (""Model-Actress-Whatever"") named Lauren Bacall, who was an eye-popping twenty-five years his junior (they were enviously referred to in 1940s Tinseltown as ""Bogey & Baby""). Life imitates art.<br/><br/>""We'll always have Paris,"" Bogart pontificates to Bergman as he stoically gives her up to Henreid in the last scene, who then both escape Casablanca to Lisbon by plane. Seriously?! Even a whiskey-soaked, man's-man like Rick would have shot Henreid's character dead in the blink of an eye to hang on to the stunning - if icy and unapproachable - Bergman.<br/><br/>The saccharine Hollywood Ending with Bogart walking off with Claude Rains with their backs to us into the fog (actually a darkened sound stage at Warner Brothers Culver City lot), with Rains offering to use the 10,000 francs he lost in a bet with Bogart to get them both to safety of the Free French garrison at Brazzaville, has become the most quoted line in pic: ""Louis, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship."" That mawkish, syrupy line - written by none other than pic's producer Hal B. Wallis himself - ran neck-and-neck for the final looped line in pic with the much more cynical, and entertaining, alternative line that he wrote: ""Louis, I always knew that you had a little larceny in your heart,"" but that line was finally considered too unpatriotic for a wartime propaganda pic."
"Cd1083","6","3","5","12 May 2015"," Meh. It was alright.
","I'll open up with my unpopular opinion. I wasn't a fan of Casablanca. It's was over the top, it was pompous and most importantly I just didn't enjoy it. Most of this has to due with context. I had some trouble on the first go around grasping everything that was going on, but I'm not holding any of that against the film.<br/><br/>The credit I will give to Casablanca is the dialog is engaging and the cinematography is excellent. The music is perfect and the acting is amazing. It's at this point I even have to ask myself, why didn't I like it? I don't know, I just didn't. It didn't speak to me in the way that lesser films have. It's quite possible that in repeat viewings I'll pick up a detail I missed the first time around and have a renewed appreciation for the film, but as it stands now I respect Casablanca for everything that it is, but I didn't enjoy it and in my eyes that's the most important part of a film, no matter how important it may be historically."
"SuperDuperMCA","8","3","5","23 April 2013"," Classic Americana
","Casablanca was a fantastic romance film but I feel as if people put it on a pedestal it doesn't deserve. Sure, the acting is terrific, the story relates to many people, and Michael Curtiz did a legendary job directing but what exactly made this movie the timeless classic it has become? I did enjoy the lighting in many scenes because it makes the viewer focus more on the charters facial expressions and body language, especially the scene in which Rick is alone drinking at the bar and Sam comes down to check on him it was also clever how the cigarette smoke blurs the screen and goes into Rick's flash back. The composition of the film is really what I enjoyed, everything is crafted so beautifully. The plot is great but just not for me I guess and if it wasn't for each scene being so artistically graceful I would have definitely lost concentration on the story. Definitely a master piece of 1942 that will never be forgotten but I would not agree with most that Casablanca is ""the greatest film of all time"". Give it a watch though if for some reason you were living under rock like me, guaranteed any viewer will find something they enjoy about the film."

","i was actually surprised at how much i liked this movie. i didn't expect to be as drawn into it as i was. the characters grew on me fast and that really kept me interested. i loved the character that Humphrey Bogart played. just his rough Brooklyn attitude really was awesome. <br/><br/>i found the story of the letters really interesting. it kinda made you on the edge of your seat. the incorporation of the love story i thought made the movie. as bad as you feel for Humphrey at points, in the end you look at him as ""he's that man!"" for doing what he did. everyone loves a heroic type guy in a movie and he played it great! <br/><br/>the movie as a whole was very well shot. a lot of shadowy shots that really intrigued me and set the whole mood for the movie."
"Scrius","Null","3","5","3 December 2012"," Everything That Makes a True Classic is Here
","To have lasting appeal in the past, present, and future, that defines a classic. As for my humble opinion, I believe there are two things which enable a filmmaker to create a classic that people hold dear: identifiable elements that are not so far-fetched from our own world and a profound message that continues to inspire and strengthen us with age. Bearing this in mind, it's understandable why the acclaimed Casablanca is a beloved work of cinema and counted among the great classic films. A romantic, patriotic, and idealistic movie that continues to stand the test of time and enchant present generations. <br/><br/>Derived from an unpublished play that surprisingly went nowhere, Casablanca is as beautifully photographed as it is narrated. The central focus is a timeless relationship between two characters played by Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman, without whom there's no doubt the movie wouldn't be as memorable or appealing. A loving relationship between Rick Blaine (Bogart) and Ilsa Lund (Bergman) in Paris tragically ends because of the outbreak of the War and leaves Rick a heartbroken and apathetic man. It drives him into hiding away from the world's problems in his café in far off Casablanca. But the fires of a lost passion are rekindled upon Ilsa's unanticipated reentry into his life, their fates forever entwined. Ilsa explains to Rick that something greater than the both of them had begun to unfold in her relationship with Victor Laszlo, the hero of the Resistance. She appeals to the sentimental heart and the patriotic spirit that rests within Rick's cynical exterior. His former self revived, Rick grants his lover and her husband passage to America in one of cinema's most memorable finales, as they say farewell outside of a plane, all for the sake of the cause they fight for. The rest is cinematic history! <br/><br/>I find it hard to believe that no one expected anything grand to come from Casablanca during the course of its development. The film is handled with great care, having a strong script and outstanding performances. Humphrey Bogart brilliantly portrays a hero, ranging from a broken man with little to lose to a redeemed figure who is changed for the better in the end. As Ilsa, Ingrid Bergman conveys a very warm and tender nature. And of course, the chemistry between Bogart and Bergman is top-notch and deeply moving. <br/><br/>Countless are all the classic moments and dialogue that even those who have never seen the movie can recognize. One of my favorite scenes takes place during the second meeting between Rick and Ilsa. Upon entering the café, Ilsa seems bathed by an almost heavenly light, symbolic of Rick's salvation. Another sequence that lingers within me is when the crowd singing La Marseillaise drowns the Nazi anthem out. Both scenes illustrate the crux themes of the movie, of how much hope a loving relationship can provide and how justice will prevail over evil if we all stand united. <br/><br/>Casablanca is not a movie that's to be marveled for technological achievements, but something infinitely more meaningful. For the leading characters, their relationship meant hope, which was exactly what was needed throughout the bleak time that was World War II. Casablanca is a movie that encourages viewers to follow their hearts and to take a stand for the many. No matter how insignificant you may seem, making a difference is never impossible. Those who have thought that Casablanca would never go far, let alone be hailed as a timeless classic, could not have been more wrong. I expect I'll be asking Sam to play it again soon!"
"JamesHitchcock","10","3","5","26 September 2012"," It gets better as time goes by
","To mark my 1100th review for IMDb I turn to another of my favourite films. And not just one of mine. Its regular appearance on lists of the greatest films of all time suggest that ""Casablanca"" is also one of the world's favourite films. It has given the English language more well-known quotations than virtually any other film- ""Here's looking at you, kid"", ""Louis, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship"", ""Round up the usual suspects"", ""We'll always have Paris"", ""Play it again, Sam"" (yes, I know that one's a misquote) and ""Of all the gin joints in all the towns in all the world, she walks into mine"" (also often misquoted, generally as ""Of all the bars..""). <br/><br/>Yet at the time it was made, it was just one of many wartime propaganda films made by Hollywood. It was based upon an obscure play which had never been performed professionally. (It still hasn't in America, although it was produced briefly in London's West End in 1991). It starred an actor best known at that date for gangster pictures, and an actress whose early Hollywood films, apart from ""Intermezzo"", had not been wildly successful. Few would have predicted, therefore, that ""Casablanca"" would not only win the ""Best Picture"" Oscar for 1943 but would also go on to enjoy such lasting popularity. <br/><br/>I don't intend to set out the plot, which is already well-known, in detail, but rather to discuss what makes it such a favourite of mine. One feature is what might be called its moral complexity, something it shares with the film noir style of which Humphrey Bogart was such a noted exponent. I would not, however, classify ""Casablanca"" as noir, largely because it does not, except perhaps in the airport scene at the end, use the sort of expressionistic photography which characterised the genre. <br/><br/>I do not mean that the film is morally ambiguous politically. Its politics are quite clear; the Nazis are evil and the Allied cause is just. (For this reason, I always wish Michael Curtiz had been allowed to use the ""Horst Wessel Lied"" in the song-duel with ""La Marseillaise"". The producers, however, refused, on the bizarre grounds that the Nazi anthem was protected by copyright, so Curtiz had to substitute ""Die Wacht am Rhein"", a 19th–century patriotic song with no Nazi connotations). <br/><br/>The film's ambiguity arises at a personal rather than political level. The only character who is unambiguously heroic is the noble and idealistic Victor. Rick Blaine starts off as a disillusioned cynic, cynical both about personal relationships and about politics, and unwilling to ""stick his neck out"" for anyone. He has a murky past, operates a gambling operation of dubious legitimacy and, for unexplained reasons, is unable to return to America. Ilsa is somewhat sanitised compared to Lois, the equivalent character in the original play, and explanations are provided for some of her more questionable actions, but the fact remains that she is in love with a man other than her husband, and would be prepared to desert her husband for that man. Louis Renault, the Chief of Police, is quite openly corrupt, accepting bribes to issue the vital ""exit visas"" which will enable refugees to leave Casablanca; if the refugee in question is an attractive woman he is prepared to accept payment in the form of sexual favours rather than cash. <br/><br/>By the end of the film, however, all three have achieved redemption. Renault, who has no love for the Vichy regime he serves or their German masters, resolves to serve his country's interests rather than his own. Ilsa recognises that her place is by her husband's side and her duty to support him in his struggle. Rick not only recovers his lost political idealism but also, like Ilsa, sacrifices his own personal happiness and puts duty before love. Rick is the only major character who is an American, and can be seen as symbolising America's own journey from neutrality to wholehearted participation in the anti-Fascist struggle. It is significant that the action takes place in early December 1941, in the last few days before Pearl Harbor. <br/><br/>The complexity of these three characters demands acting of a high standard, and Bogart, Bergman and Claude Rains are all excellent. Bogart is particularly good; this is the finest of all his performances that I have seen, better even than ""The African Queen"" for which he won his only Oscar. (Not having seen Paul Lukas in""Watch on the Rhine"" I cannot say whether Bogart deserved to win in 1943). There are several other good performances; those that stand out most come from Sydney Greenstreet as Rick's business rival Ferrari and Conrad Veidt as the main Nazi Major Strasser.<br/><br/>Paul Henreid as Victor is sometimes regarded as the acting ""weak link"", and he is certainly less than charismatic, but I felt this was necessary to emphasise the contrast between his character and Rick's. Rick may have a dubious past, but Bogart also makes him fascinating and charming enough to win and retain Ilsa's love, even though she is married to a man of great nobility whom she deeply admires. Henreid, by contrast, makes Victor the sort of man who can inspire admiration but who does not perhaps have enough warmth on a personal level to retain the wholehearted love of his wife. <br/><br/>Another notable feature is the musical score, making reference to the French and German national anthems, and the songs, especially ""As Time Goes By"", originally written in 1931 but since 1943 always associated with this film. <br/><br/>There is not sufficient space here to do justice to all the many aspects of this wonderful film. I will therefore just close my review by saying that as a combination of war, adventure and romance, and for its perfect marriage of script, direction, acting and music, ""Casablanca"" cannot be beaten. It gets better as time goes by. 10/10"

","I have always watched and enjoyed movies produced all over the world but I feel its high time I put my thoughts on paper for the sake of records at least . Also, these will have the potential to create some nostalgic value later.<br/><br/>Coincidentally, I watched Casablanca for the first time (emotionally) few days back. The movie which is largely known as one of the greatest love stories of all time is not one, its much more than a mere love story.<br/><br/>It is a work of a man who at the time of making this piece seemed to have acquired such levels of skills in his art form that it is next to impossible to be able to find a flaw in this work even for the finest of the observers. <br/><br/>How do I even start here? I should very well start with the image which has not left me ever since I have finished watching the movie. There is no doubt that Ingrid Bergman is one of the most naturally beautiful actresses Hollywood has seen in the last century, but in my opinion she is also one of the very few actors who could speak through their eyes exactly what was there in the heart of the character she was playing. This is a skill/gift which is found in a rare breed of actors. The scene where she looks at Rick (Humphrey Bogart) after all those years of separation is a perfect example of the role eyes ought to play to emote ones feelings without utterance of a single alphabet. Its hard to believe how she did not receive an Oscar nomination for this movie as she ended up receiving seven of them in a long glittering career. The prospect of watching all of those is a temptation that can not be defined.<br/><br/>I haven't seen all of Bergman's fine performances but in the few that I have seen, one can easily conclude that she has the ability to give multiple layers to her character which is the case in Casablanca as well. The flair with which she has been able to shift between various moods of innocence, mystery and sheer passion is remarkable. Of course, credit must also go to Curtiz who orchestrated this mood dance. <br/><br/>The character of Rick is like an iceberg which has been put in fire to melt and vanish and just before it starts to lose its identity it takes inspiration from itself and extinguishes the fire with the water it had lost. There could not have been a better choice for this role than Humphrey Bogart, every square inch of whose countenance reflects the state of mind he is in. Moreover, he is a true style icon in this movie and fits the part to the hilt which pops up the following question: was the role of Rick written for him or he was the best fit for the role!<br/><br/>As is seems, the image of protagonists is at the top of my mind their role in the greatness of the movie is certainly not limited to being the faces of the movie. Having said that, below the surface its the work of a master who has engineered multiple components into a giant which overpowers most others in its proximity. This fine piece of work makes its entry straight into the list of Cinema Extraordinaire because of its universal appeal, unique treatment, essentially real yet whimsical script, gripping screenplay and stupendous display of ever changing human behavior.<br/><br/>The range of emotions and situations this film has on offer at every stage of the movie makes it a sumptuous and delicious meal for audiences of varying taste. The movie reaches its climax in 95 minutes and it feels like that perfectly timed dessert which is an extremely rare delight. <br/><br/>The manner in which any two characters have been linked in this movie is the most unique to say the least. There are many two way relationships which have been portrayed with considerable depth on screen in such a small time that you start wondering by the time movie reaches its final moments that how was it even possible to experience so much in such a short time.<br/><br/>Every character leaves an indelible mark even though all it did in the movie was hit a few guitar strings or pick pocket at a restaurant. Every scene in the movie is a study in itself.<br/><br/>This is a must watch for anyone who has ever thought of himself as a movie fan. Casablanca without doubt makes its way in my all time top 5 list!<br/><br/>www.imnotafilmcritic.blogspot.in"

","For a long time I felt ashamed that I had never seen ""Casablanca"" which is among the most legendary movies ever made. Last night I finally had the chance to watch it and I was very surprised how good it actually was even this day when movies are so different. If you are going to watch this movie you honestly have to relate to the time when it was made, because if you're going to watch it like any other movie, you may be disappointed.<br/><br/>It was breath taking to see how detailed this movie actually was. Everything's just so precise, from the dialog to every single item that you see on the screen, even if it was only in the background. You can't even compare the acting to acting these days, it just isn't anything near it, as it's a totally different art form of its own, so significant and so great. Every single word spoken by every character is so powerful and compelling, every word is precise and carefully chosen. Humphrey Bogart is perfect for the role, a bad ass American, Rick Blaine, who owns a night club at Casablanca during the World War II, but yet he is surprisingly soft-hearted. Then there's the beautiful Ingrid Bergman, whose beauty shines through the screen in her role of Ilsa Lund, the woman who was Rick's one time love when they met in Paris. The story between Rick and Ilsa is filled with passion like no other, making the whole movie one of the most passionate movies ever made.<br/><br/>The screenplay's just excellent and it also compliments the whole directing of the movie. It progresses with scenes that are just so phenomenal, so legendary and so nostalgic. It includes one of the most legendary quotes in the history of motion pictures, for example; ""Play it once, Sam"", ""We'll always have Paris"" and ""I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship"". Even when I had never seen the movie, I just immediately recognised those sentences and smiled, as they are among the sentences everybody knows even if they've never seen ""Casablanca"" before. The whole plot is also surprisingly exciting, comparing to the plots nowadays it would definitely work in any movie, as it is just so thrilling from the beginning till the end and you just can't know how it ends before the last minute of the movie. The final solution's just genius and it's actually so good that I had to start clapping my hands together when the movie ended. Superb.<br/><br/>One of the best things now when I've seen the film is that I can finally be proud in saying ""I've seen Casablanca. And I love it"" Even after 65 years, ""Casablanca"" simply shines, making it enjoyable in every imaginable way. It's thrilling, it's passionate, it's flowing and it's just excellent. Throw away your thoughts of modernity and enjoy some real nostalgia with amazing role performances, superb directing and an excellent screenplay. A masterpiece."

","If there was ever a movie that proved the old saw, ""there are no small parts, only small actors,"" this is it. While I usually feel that directors are responsible for the greatness of films, not actors, this is certainly a case to test that rule. The more than capable cast give, almost to a one, riveting performances; consider how, in a very few minutes of screen time, Peter Lorre, or Sydney Greenstreet, capture not only our attention, but the essence of the shady, disreputable characters they play. There is an ocean of sublime performance in Lorre's deliver of the ""You despise me, don't you?"" line; hams like Costner, Cruise and die Caprio should be forced to watch him over and over, until they get it right.<br/><br/>Or consider Conrad Veidt (Major Strasser), who in life had fled from the Nazis, and despised them, but gave far more than a caricature or stock performance as an evil Prussian; watch how he probes Rick in the scene in the Café Americain and read the conflict in his eyes as he gives a truly nuanced read to lines that could have flopped in the hands of a lesser actor.<br/><br/>And then there is S.Z. Sakall's performance as the head waiter, Carl; we sense that the actor had, in his mind, a full back story that is barely alluded to in the script, save for a single time when a waiter calls him ""Professor"". That is richness at a Tolkeinian level.<br/><br/>Of course, a good deal of the strength of this movie, and the characters in it, derives from the excellent script; but this script changed and developed as the film shoot progressed (a very famous story), and as the writing team changed, and changed again. It is the actors fleshing out the roles that made the story and the brilliant ending. Not to say that Director Micahel Curitz was just along for the ride, but he managed to capture art by seeing what would work, and where to go next  an unusual kind of brilliance.<br/><br/>And, what can be said about the depth of Humphrey Bogart's or Ingrid Bergman's acting? Thank the gods of film that the roles were not given to Ronald Regan or Ann Sheridan; what a hash they would have made of this.<br/><br/>Competent camera work, lighting and set design show that it isn't a huge budget that makes a great picture; nor, at 102 minutes running time, can length be the key ingredient in a first class film. The self indulgent movie makers of today should take note  why insist of inflicting bloated budgets on the industry, and bloated 3 hour ordeals on the public when so much more can be done with so much less?"

","Any man who has a true love should rent or buy a copy of Casablanca. The look on Ilsa Lund's face when Rick walks into the lounge and their eyes meet cannot be described. I wish that someday a woman will look at me that way. The best movie ever made! Conrad Veight was the highest paid actor to appear in the film. Dooley Wilson could not play the piano a lick. There have been many bars with various names connected to ""Casablanca"" but they are all shams. ""Sixty Minutes"" on CBS did a segment on the movie with Harry Reasoner reporting. It was done on the set of the movie in Hollywood. Harry told the behind the scenes story about Ronald Reagan being cast as Rick but it didn't work out. At the end of the piece Harry spoke of the first time he saw the movie. He mentioned the lady he saw it with and finished - ""if you are watching tonight,'here's looking at you kid""."

Victor must get out, but Rick, who has accidentally gotten some papers of transit (which are widely known to be a nonsense concept in reality) Somehow, Victor's got to get those papers, and we're supposed to be entertained by a lot of people just standing around trying to be witty, and often (except Claude Rains a few times) falling flat on their face. <br/><br/>This has got to be the worst possible way to approach a story about World War Two. It's about a LOVE STORy, and, of course, a Hollywood type where affairs are justified so long as the parties are attractive enough. No real explorations into what was going on at the time are made, and frankly, the ""All Nazis Are Bad, But We Allies Can't Help But Be Good."" stance frankly was old by then: it's TRIUMPH OF THE WILL reversed only not as well made. I mean, yes the Nazi Party was the most blatantly evil in existence (maybe the Japanese one was as bad if you study what happened in China) but that doesn't mean every nazi was ready to shoot at a moment's notice, and not every officer a more arrogant version of Colonel Klink. <br/><br/>Wrapping up: This movie is obsolete trash not worthy of your time."

Old sentimental and patriotic rhetoric about the ""tough guy with tender heart"", helpless woman who ""suffers"" because she's torn between two lovers, manichean vision of the good (Americans), rather lost (French collaborators), and bad (the Germans) guys. Even Titanic seemed much more convincing. And why is it that Humphrey Bogart is supposed to be such a seductive legend? I find him dull and devoid of expression, much less empathy. I think the demographic breakdown of the vote on Casablanca explain in part the basis for the enthusiasm: most positive have been old-age men. Those who are still admiring the patronizing male."
"jimbo-53-186511","6","4","8","7 November 2014"," It's not a bad film by any means, but the hype surrounding it is ridiculous
","In some ways Casablanca is a very difficult film for me to review as there isn't really much technically wrong with it; it's well-scripted, fairly well-acted and the musical score is excellent. It's probably best to analyse this film by highlighting the good and the bad points of this film; <br/><br/>What I liked about Casablanca in the first instance is the story; refugees who have come from different parts of Europe to the neutral safe haven of Casablanca which is in unoccupied French Morocco. In the beginning. we see snippets of various people who are desperate to leave Casablanca and we see these people have conversations with various people who are prepared to take bribes in order to fulfil their dreams of leaving Casablanca. Although Casablanca is an unoccupied area, refugees are still at risk of being forced into concentration camps hence their desire to flee for proper safe havens such as the US for example. Rick Blaine (Humphrey Bogart) is an American expatriate who has fled occupied France and now runs a successful café/bar in Casablanca - he's a popular member of the community, but he becomes even more popular and important when several parties learn that he has acquired two exit visas - 1 of which is for Victor Lazlo (Paul Henreid) who the German Reich are very interested in and who are very keen on Lazlo staying in Casablanca. Blaine becomes pivotal to Lazlo's fate, but Lazlo's wife perhaps also proves pivotal to Blaine's fate as well. This creates a bit of a dilemma for Blaine which helps to increase the intrigue within the film. There was also the wonderful Dooley Wilson's portrayal as Sam - he only had a small role in the film, but I found him to be a warm and caring character and his voice was very soothing and I could listen to him sing 'As Time Goes By' all day - such a wonderful voice. So far, so good....<br/><br/>What I didn't like about Casablanca was how contrived and far fetched the romance was between Blaine and Lund; they fall head over heels for each other in a few days so much so that even 2 years later Blaine can't look at another woman or develop any sort of a relationship with any woman whatsoever. Please? Give me a break!! Don't get me wrong. I know that romances like this do exist, but they're usually built up over a long period of time and will usually come through several years of life experiences. I found it hard to believe that they would love each other that much when they both admit that they barely know each other; think about it. Would you fall in love with someone who you barely know? Remember don't confuse 'love' with 'lust'. It also didn't help that the film was pretty much devoid of any sort of tension or conflict - considering it is billed as a Drama, I didn't see much on screen that could be classed as Dramatic. Factor all of this with three unlikeable leads and you've got yourself a very flawed film (note that I said 'flawed' rather than 'bad').<br/><br/>Casablanca is a film that is worth watching, but you really need to ignore the hype and judge it on its own merits. If you're a sucker for a nice war time romance then this will do the trick. However, if you look at it a bit deeper, you will see the good, but somewhat 'flawed' classic that I watched."
"Poppybiscuit","6","4","8","7 March 2013"," Cringeworthy dialogue and humour - great cinema, embarrassing film.
","Lots to like in terms of defining what a classic film is all about, and there are certainly some memorable quotes but most of the dialogue is so camp and cringeworthy, it is hard not to feel a little embarrassed most of the time. Nobody escapes the terrible script which is saved because I think the writer is trying to make this a comedy or a parody. A bit like Carry on Casablanca might be. I like Rick's response to Ilsa's leading question on the veranda in Paris. Most men would have followed Ilsa's lead and moved to the bedroom after the ""Is that cannon fire or my heart pounding?"" But not our manly Rick who replies with his highly interesting knowledge of tanks. The dialogue between Mr and Mrs Leuchtag. What watch - ten watch - such much - is typical of the dribble that is all through this film. I can't write but I know what a cringeworthy script is and this is one. Captain Renault has the highest proportional of bad one-liners though. I think he got his script out of some Christmas crackers. But there are plenty of great lines too so overall it carries itself through along with some great music and plenty of earnest overacting. I like the film - I just can't take it seriously. An 8.7 rating is only because there have been few too many sheep voting - it's great cinema, just not a very good film."
"lee_eisenberg","10","4","8","28 November 2005"," Here's lookin' at you, film.
","Overall, ""Casablanca"" went a little overboard on being pro-American, but certain traits make it worthwhile. The plot of course has American expatriate Rick Blaine (Humphrey Bogart) owning a Cafe Americain in WWII-era Casablanca and meeting ex-lover Ilsa (Ingrid Bergman).<br/><br/>Much of the film's strength lies in its dialogue. Rick says ""I don't stick my neck out for nobody."" Alone, this helps the audience understand what kind of a person he is, but the movie also shows his other side. When Ilsa comes to the café, Sam (Dooley Wilson) tells her ""A lot of water been under the bridge."" This alone is enough to describe not only Rick and Ilsa's life, but also the events that had come to dominate the world during the past few years.<br/><br/>As for the other characters, Paul Henreid plays Ilsa's husband Victor Laszlo. Even though he has been fighting the Nazis, one wonders how much value he has in life. Capt. Renault (Claude Rains) is amoral but we grow to respect him. Conrad Veidt, Peter Lorre, and Sydney Greenstreet also provide great characters. All in all, ""Casablanca"" remains the embodiment of the phrase: ""They don't make 'em like they used to."""

","This is pure War Propaganda in disguise of a ""B"" movie, and as it happens with every politicization of art, it ages quicker. Not that Casablanca has too much to age though, as a film released as a somewhat vulgar piece. The scenarios are cheesy, to which my guess is they didn't have time nor money to elaborate on that. The acting from the two main characters, portrayed by Bogard and Bergson are weak at best. He has basically two face expressions, and switch from number 1 to number 2 when so circumstances dictate.<br/><br/>The two thumbnails to the trailers happen to show both. She doesn't glance that much neither. The close ups are there to highlight that, maybe. Saying more on Bogard, he is his predictable tough shell with a moral inner core, which in this particular case means to oppose the bad German guys. Not very inventive. The French Captain Renault (Claude Rains) is another painful figure to watch, an ugly caricature with a ludicrous accent, and his acting you can't buy as with most of these stagy-level-performance actors. One can save but one. Ugarte (Peter Lorre) is real amid fakes. And still on what brings this movie from a ""0″ to a generous ""4″. I save ones and twos for disasters and this isn't one. It is more a case of sketchy story-telling, with lowsy characters. What saves it from being ""3″ is the presence of some good camera angles, which in comparison to what had been done at the time in terms of US productions are quite innovative. And maybe on its release date it might have had some appeal, saying something like ""let's kick some Nazi asses"". It is an attempt at being glamorous as well; ill-faded completely nevertheless. Besides that, very little to offer with the pathetic ""Here's is looking at you, kid"".<br/><br/>The last sequence, the airplane one, sums it up.<br/><br/>Poor acting, poor Drama, cheesy carton airplane to end up an excuse of a classic. People are afraid of actually watching it and being critical, thus regarded as ignorant film-wise and hence the many 10 out of 10 reviews. It's easier to go with the flow ! with the bunch.

Certainly, the soundtrack is brilliant, and it probably is among the top films in soundtrack alone.<br/><br/>As a story and a film overall, my personal opinion is that this film is over-rated. Perhaps in the time it was made, it was among the best films. I think the majority of people would find the film tedious to sit through nowadays.

"TheMovieDiorama","8","2","3","23 February 2019"," Casablanca dances the war-driven night away with sweeping romanticism.
","Another classic that many critics and cinephiles believe to be one of the greatest pieces of cinema ever. And much like 'Citizen Kane', I unfortunately was not overly enamoured by it. That's not to say I didn't like it, in fact I thought it was a very classy romance amidst the prickly politics of World War II. The drama just lacked, well, drama. Rick, a nightclub owner, reacquaints himself with his former flame in Casablanca, to which her husband happens to be a famed rebel wanted by Nazi officials, leaving Rick with an ultimatum. Remain bitter and see these two lovers split due to the Nazi regime, or provide assistance in helping them escape but remain broken-hearted.<br/><br/>Set almost primarily in the club, director Curtiz successfully balances a variety of suave characters during a time of chaos. Refugees are overpopulating the city as they try to flee Europe, officials of the Third Reich wander the streets and local businessmen are constantly bartering with foreigners. The club and its customers acts as microcosm for the war, with the French consistently attempting to overpower the Germans and vice versa. Two opposing sides having to coexist in one large hall, with Rick acting as an overseer. The succinct dialogue and memorable quotes (""Here's looking at you, kid"") is all thanks to an adapted screenplay that essentially carries the film. Sure, Bogart and Bergman's performances were good, but they would not have got any recognition if it weren't for that beautiful script. It's easy to list everything that Casablanca does right, I mean we all know it's supposed to be one of the greats (and it is). Gorgeous cinematography, inventive scene transitions and wonderful tracking shots.<br/><br/>But at no point did I feel that the characters were in danger or even remotely having any engrossing drama between themselves. After all, it's set during a devastating war, and strangely that historic event is put aside for the romance. Yes, it's a mature love story, and the film succeeds in that sense. However much of the focus was set on Laszlo, to whom I believe was underdeveloped. It's only during the last twenty minutes that certain plot details are set into motion, consequently making the preceding hour watchable but inconsistently paced. Rick's nostalgic flashback in particular skews the pacing and unfortunately is drawn out, in an attempt to lay the foundations of his romance with Ilsa.<br/><br/>There is no doubt that Casablanca is an important film. It was back in 1942 and still is today. Yet the curse of having the acclaim of ""one of the greatest films of all time"" results in expectations never being met. Technically a perfect film, but lacks that ""oomph"" to push it even further."

That may sound strange, because I just labeled it as a terrific romantic movie, which it is, but ""Casablance"" starts out as a suspenseful cat and mouse game, between the german nazi's and a wanted resistance leader during World War II. The romance part stealthily sneaks into the movie later on and builds up in strength. And what strength of passion there is to be admired! Highly recommended.

It stars Humphrey Bogart as a no nonsense nightclub owner during the second world war who is haunted by past romance. Ingrid Bergman reenters his life and all the memories return. She is now married to a fighter-resistant man who wishes to shelter himself in Bogart's nightclub. He evaporates into alcohol reflecting upon the last time he saw her. A masterpiece that avoids the predictable and goes for the emotional struggle. Directed by Michael Curtiz who previously made The Adventures of Robin Hood. Bogart flawlessly portraying a man struggling with brokenness and a crossroad of right and wrong. Bergman is terrific as a woman emotionally entangled within the past and present. In supporting roles are Claude Rains as a police chief who delivers the cheerful and much quoted final line. Paul Henreid plays Bergman's underground husband who must rely on his wife's former lover's integrity to survive. Peter Lorre also appears briefly in one of his sinister roles that he plays so well.

Rick is the one single ingredient in the film, which is the pivot of all the riveting poignant drama that is superbly played by Bogart.

"estebangonzalez10","10","2","3","21 June 2015"," We'll always have Casablanca
","""Of all the gin joints, in all the towns, in all the world, she walks into mine.""<br/><br/>This is another personal favorite of mine and perhaps one of the most quotable classic films of all time. Directed by Michael Curtiz, Casablanca takes place during the early days of World War II in French Morocco where many European refugees were searching for a way to escape to the Americas and evade Nazi control. In Casablanca we are quickly introduced to the owner of a nightclub, an American expatriate named Rick Blaine (Humphrey Bogart). Rick is a bitter and cynical man who has decided to look out for himself and offer his clients a good time at his club. But when a man shows up and gives Rick a couple of transit letters that will allow the holder of these papers to travel freely through Europe in order to escape to the United States from Lisbon, they know they can make a lot of money by finding the right buyer. A married couple show up at Rick's bar to buy the letters and this is where we discover why Rick is so bitter. Victor's (Paul Henreid) wife Ilsa (Ingrid Bergman), had met Rick in Paris a while back when she thought her husband, a resistance leader, had been killed during the War. The two had an affair, but when Ilsa discovered that Victor was alive and that he had escaped the Nazi concentration camp where he was held she leaves Rick without giving him any explanation. Rick has never been able to get over the betrayal and seeing her at his joint with her husband makes him even more bitter. And so the adventure begins as Rick must decide if he wants to help Victor and Ilsa escape from the Nazis or if he should simply look the other way. Claude Rains has a supporting role as a corrupt French official while Conrad Veldt plays a Nazi Major.<br/><br/>Today we all praise the screenwriters for this film, but there was much skepticism during filming. Neither Bergman nor Bogart thought it was any good and some claim that they didn't want to work together. I don't think Michael Curtiz ever imagined this film would become such a beloved classic either, but somehow the film clicked in all cylinders and the story has stuck with audiences ever since. The on screen chemistry between Bogart and Bergman is the main reason why the romance works so well and the scenes they ask Sam to play their song on his piano is memorable. It's the best romantic film of all time in my opinion because it has it all: romance, betrayal, and sacrificial love. There are so many beloved quotes in this film and it only gets better over time. The ending is also one of the best in any movie and one of the reasons why so many consider this such a revered classic, but I can point out several other emotional moments such as the scene where Sam is ordered to play a German patriotic song for the Nazi soldiers in the bar, only to have Victor respond by asking the band leader to play La Marseillaise and drown out the song from the Germans. Even the revelation scene where we get flashbacks of Rick and Ilsa's affair and discover how she never meets up with him at the train station and instead he's handed a farewell note from her, is quite emotionally engaging. The film offers plenty of thrilling scenes as well for those that aren't interested in the romance so there is no excuse for anyone not to see this classic. In case you forget how brilliant the screenplay is let me just remind you of some of the best quotes in this movie.<br/><br/>""Louie, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship."" ""If that plane leaves the ground and you're not with him, you'll regret it. Maybe not today. Maybe not tomorrow, but soon and for the rest of your life."" ""We'll always have Paris."" ""Here's looking at you kid."" ""Play it, Sam. Play ""As Time Goes By."""" ""I remember every detail. The Germans wore gray, you wore blue."" ""Alright, I'll make it easier for you- Go ahead and shoot. You'll be doing me a favor."" ""Round up the usual suspects."" ""Mostly I remember the last one. The wow finish. A guy standing on a station platform in the rain with a comical look in his face because his insides have been kicked out.""

","This is one of the best films I have ever seen. Everything about it is absolutely perfect. The story is so rich with social meaning and significance. It portrays the absolute terror that was occurring during WWII without being grotesque or violent. It shows how desperate people were to keep their heads above water, and out of Nazi control. <br/><br/>The acting is phenomenal. Humphrey Bogart is effortlessly cool, and translates the idea of the isolationist mentality of Americans at the time before the war. Ingrid Bergman is so pure and honest, her character comes across through the incredible emotion she is able to express on screen. <br/><br/>All of this aside, the thing that absolutely sets this movie apart from others like it is the writing. The script is amazing. It might be the best script ever. Every line is carefully thought out. No line is a waste everything anyone says has meaning. <br/><br/>Please go watch this movie.

","Lovers from the past find each other once again in Casablanca during the early years of World War II. Rick, a tough and seemingly cold American ex pat is reunited with the love of his life Ilsa when she walks into his Cafe, years after she left him waiting for her at the train station in Paris. When Rick comes into possession of two letters of transit the two plan to leave Casablanca together but he instead chooses to make sure Ilsa is safe away from Casablanca and gives her away to her husband.<br/><br/>I'm sad to say that Casablanca was not exactly what I expected. Even with a little background information on what was taking place during the film, it was still rather difficult to follow with what seemed like lots of characters thrown into the mix. The flow of the film seemed a bit inconsistent; slow for long periods with small bursts of important information. Being referred to as one of the most romantic screen plays of all time, I was a bit let down to see little romance and was little there was, lacked in true on screen chemistry.<br/><br/>Although my first impression of the film was not the best, I believe it is one that deserves to be a watched a few more times in order to understand and follow it better."

","What can anyone say about Casablanca that hasn't already been said? It is one of the most prolific, successful, and critically lauded films in American history. It's also one of my personal favourite films. From start to finish, the dialogue is endlessly quotable without becoming obnoxious, and it maintains a keen wit that is unforgettably punched into film canon with Humphrey Bogart's legendary delivery. Bergman is angelically filmed in each scene with extreme attention paid to framing and lighting, and she flawlessly portrays a woman tortured by her situation. The special attention to the lighting, the bustling Rick's café, the unique period of American neutrality before involvement in WWII... The list of things I love about this movie goes on and on. Few films are more deserving of a perfect score than Casablanca."
"Emillion","9","2","3","13 November 2014"," ""I stick my head out for nobody.""
","Michael Curtiz's masterpiece, Casablanca, is easily one of my favorite movies of all time. The plot brilliantly demonstrates self sacrifice and ever- lasting love in a way that is untraditional and completely original. Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman have amazing chemistry that really brings the story to life. The lighting is perfect and natural, despite being filmed in a studio, the dialog has a good rhythm, and the composition was spot on. The image appeared to be very crisp and clear with no imperfections. The sets and prop designs were beautiful with a truly authentic Moroccan style. The flashbacks were very well shot and utilized effectively, there were a few comparison shots that were well thought out. Overall Casablanca is a movie far beyond its time that will be forever loved and respected."
"Mustaveli","9","2","3","18 October 2014"," Superb setting
","So far, this movie has the best lighting I've ever seen. Everything worked so well that I don't think I'd have to see the movie in color. My favorite thing about it was how the lights outside of the club worked so well. Nothing was too saturated, and you could tell what was what, and who was who. Even characters who were darker than others were seen well, and that's something big with me. <br/><br/>Sure, the movie was a little cheesy but I honestly liked it. Rick's character is probably my favorite, and both he and Lund were extremely good looking throughout the whole thing. It was a bit disappointing that they didn't get together in the end, especially with how their previous relationship affected Rick to become the cold man he was at the beginning of the movie. His development was interesting, and pretty good. The one thing I could say that I didn't like was how everything moved a little too fast for me. Though that in itself is great, a perfectly re-watchable movie. Casablanca had a wonderful setting, a well selected cast and I still can't get over the perfect lighting."

","Casablanca is the story of an American man in WWII era Morocco and his struggle in choosing between ""love and virtue"". Confronted by the woman he once loved and her new husband, a Czech resistance leader and important figure in the fight against the Nazis, the film focuses on Rick's internal conflict over deciding between his desires or the good of many others.<br/><br/>Casablanca is a testament to what you can accomplish with a spectacular cast and a beautiful, thoughtfully made set. The vast majority of the film takes place in Rick's Cafe Americain and focuses on a handful of characters, but even with it's relatively crowded story it never fails to feel well rounded and entirely better off than if were to use a wider array of characters and locations.<br/><br/>Humphrey Bogart stars as Rick Blaine, the owner of Rick's Cafe Americain. Bogart gives the film a career defining performance and makes his character the most compelling male lead I've ever seen in a love story. When dealing with the politics brought into the Cafe Americain he's cool, calm, and composed in his efforts to remain neutral in all matters, but when we see him alone after hours in his office he becomes very convincingly distraught over his love interest Ilsa. He is shown on multiple occasions alone in his office shrouded by the complete darkness of a Casablancan night, with only a thin ray of light shining through a window to illuminate his face. He drinks from a tall bottle of booze with a grim, haunted expression that gave me a real empathy for the toll his endeavors were taking on him. The rest of the cast performed well enough that there were no noticeable weak links, but there was really no way for them to escape the shadow cast by Bogart's performance.<br/><br/>My favorite thing about the film was Rick's Cafe Americain. The Cafe itself was just a series of sets constructed in Warner Brothers Studios in Burbank California, but it was so fitting and perfect for the film it left the same kind of impression that would be made by a well made fantasy location. Its stone walls were decorated in the shadows left by ornate lamps and intricate patterns made to shine light in from the outside. It was so packed full of extras during all of the scenes taking place there that it always created the atmosphere of a real bar. These things were vital to the film because so much of it was contained within these walls, and it was so great that I loved every moment of the scenes there.<br/><br/>Casablanca is a real classic. It's the sort of movie that feels like an experience and makes you glad you've seen it. It was all so excellent that I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to anyone who loves movies. When you see some of these scenes for yourself you immediately understand how they've had such a lasting influence to this day."
"JohnnyAces","10","2","3","19 June 2014"," Timeless Romance
","In the days of my youth I merely thought CASABLANCA was a wonderful movie -- exciting, hopelessly romantic and very satisfying. Humphrey Bogart was the man who more than any other I wanted to be and who, in occasional fantasies, I imagined I was. Ingrid Bergman was the woman I wanted to love and protect from all dangers. At first, Paul Henreid did not really fit into my calculations. The idea of the noble sacrifice was quite new to me then, but I caught on quickly and, having toyed with the idea that Henreid instead of Bogart should have gone off to Brazzaville with Claude Rains, I realized that things had to work out as they did, and I felt better for accepting the fact.<br/><br/>A half-century later, I love CASABLANCA not a whit less, probably even more because, like all the movies we loved in our youth, it now carries a rich frosting of personal associations and a sweet melancholy, born of the intimations of mortality -- the viewer's own, confirmed as it were by the passage of the film's wondrous stars.<br/><br/>And, after a half-century, I can see CASABLANCA, at least a little more objectively, as the apotheosis of the Hollywood romantic melodrama, a kind of fearless and perfected make-believe that you probably couldn't get away with today. Singing the Marseillaise in the face of the snarling Gestapo men! As I am frequently told (as if it were somehow my fault), they don't make movies like that any more. It's true, they don't, and I explain sadly that it's because they don't make the world the way they used to, either. Romantic idealism doesn't come as easily as once it did. Information, and rather too much of it, has led us toward being, in Oscar Wilde's formulation, cynics who know the price of everything and the value of nothing. We can't play make-believe the way we used to, and the loss is ours. Out of wartime reality, Howard Koch and the Epstein brothers, Philip and Julius, constructed a beautiful, tragic, heroic dream and no small part of its appeal now is that it arose and reflected the world in which things seemed to be simpler and clearer. (Whether they were or not is irrelevant.)<br/><br/>Thirty viewings later (at least), I still can't watch only a little of CASABLANCA; I have to stay aboard until Brazzaville. And I can't watch any of it without a tightening of the throat and a hint of moisture in the eyes, sighing for the kind of immortality the movies provide their stars and the savor they lend to our more transient lives."

","One of the greatest films of the 40's and one of the best American films of all times. This film gives you the view of WWII no body else can. From the little city in Morroco the story of Rick the bartender gives you the best story of life outside the U.S during the early years of WWII. I'm talking about WWII, but once you start watching this film you wouldn't be so sure if it really is about a war, a relationship, or fight within a war. This film can't be put in as just one genre because there is just so much different events happening nobody could put just one genre on this film.<br/><br/>This classic film gives the viewers everything you can want in a film. The film is mainly filmed at night meaning there is a need for lighting that is practically done perfect for every scene. The acting shows great chemistry between the main couple that really only has chemistry in flashbacks. The photography is done so well for dark scenes and even give you scenes from France that make you feel like your in France while the war is only miles away you feel like your there. This film was done as an A film and I agree that it is and found no problems with the editing or any other part of the film.<br/><br/>This film was intended to be a patriotic film, but today people who haven't seen would not know just by knowing the name of the film. This film takes the audience to the safe areas of the war and shows them how everyone in the film is affected by the war. The famous scene done with the two anthems being sung at the same time was done to predict the outcome of the war. In Ricks bar the German soldiers begin singing their anthem, but Rick gets Victor a man that was from France began to sing the French anthem and got the entire bar to sing along and got the band to get even louder, in which overpower the few German soldiers. As the film continues the German soldiers around the bar become more aggressive and show Rick that even though he is neutral they aren't afraid to stop him, but when Rick allowed Victor to sing the anthem really showed that Rick had picked a side and was going by it.<br/><br/>This film was put out in theaters before the war ended and became a very Patriotic film for just Americans and anyone else supporting it. This film was seen as a normal film to the creators but the viewers saw the film as one of a kind and really was in a way propaganda against the Germans in WWII."

The story is great, the atmosphere is great, and the photography is SPECTACULAR (I love the shadows and the lamps). And Bogart and Bergman are perfect. There's just enough mystery to keep it going at a steady pace. The dialogue is good too- - entertaining and witty, but it's not out of this world. <br/><br/>I also like that the ending differs from the expected, leaving the audience intentionally disappointed that Rick doesn't go with Ilsa (in a good and necessary way, I think). Okay, I lied; there is one little thing that bothers me. I appreciate this film more from an aesthetic standpoint —I don't get much emotional connection to it."

Casablanca is so captivating, and while watching it, it is hard to not feel like you are a part of the romantic drama that you are watching. There are so many emotions packed into this film, and there is not one scene in the film that you feel like could be cut out. The chemistry between Bogart and Bergman is undeniable. The two act flawlessly together which really adds to how great it is. I'm still amazed at how well this was made for the lack of technology that was available at this time.

"antagonist117","10","2","3","25 March 2014"," A simple formula never done better
","It's almost axiomatic that a ""prestige drama,"" the kind that contends for awards and aims to join the canon, must combine a love story with a weighty historical plot line. Best Picture winners ""The Deer Hunter,"" ""Out of Africa,"" ""The English Patient,"" ""Titanic,"" as well as countless films that didn't take the Academy's top prize, all fit neatly into this category. It is probably too simplistic to say that all these movies are on some level attempts to remake ""Casablanca,"" and certainly movies, not to mention plays and books, had discovered long before ""Casablanca"" that mixing romantic drama and historical drama makes for good entertainment. But ""Casablanca"" became a template and a benchmark. These facts are attested to by the number of its one-liners that became part of the cultural lexicon, and by its apparently permanent residence near the top of critical and popular lists of great films. One important element that sets it apart from run-of-the-mill, wanna-be historical romances is its humor, an ingredient many ""serious"" movies neglect to utilize. One moment the French national anthem brings us to our feet and tears to our eyes, and the next we are laughing at one of the funniest lines and most imitable comic deliveries in movies, Claude Rains's ""I am shocked, shocked..."" Every scene belongs almost to a different genre: the script rotates jokes, intrigue and espionage, a dreamy romance in flashback form, a will-they-or-won't-they soap opera in the present, musical numbers, and high-minded talk of war and freedom. But for all that, it doesn't feel like the movie is overstuffed or that there's even particularly a lot going on beneath the surface. It is tempting to read the studiously-neutral but soft-hearted American Rick (Humphrey Bogart) as a metaphor for the U.S.'s reluctance to intervene in European conflicts, and it is interesting to observe the ways this wartime Hollywood movie depicts European refugees of various ages, nationalities, and genders, but in this case it is more fun to simply be swept along by the movie as a great piece of entertainment. ""Casablanca"" is ""just"" a simple story well-told, set in an exotic and dangerous and alluring locale, and it might be that better than anything else has ever been that."

","It's quite a burden for a man to start writing a review for ""Casablanca"" (1942), the film loved and seen by everyone, and of which everything seems to be said a thousand times. The over-used statement ""we must fight for this film so that the future generations can enjoy it"" just doesn't work for ""Casablanca"" since no fighting is necessary. It doesn't need our help. Generations after generations have embraced the film and begun a beautiful friendship with it. This process has become a fundamental element in our culture which remains as time goes by.<br/><br/>A memorable line after another, stylistic noir-aesthetics and a bunch of amazing performances make ""Casablanca"" a true cult-classic in the word's most actual meaning. Everything is just right. Even the most die-hard supporter of the auteur theory must humble before this film and admit that it is a great piece of work without a distinct author. It is a sleeper whose success and popularity can only be explained by the equal input of the director, the many writers, the actors and the audience which cherishes it so. <br/><br/>One uniting element, a force which glues everything together can, however, be found, and that is time. ""Casablanca"" is so luminously a child of its own time that to neglect this aspect seems blasphemous. A big part of its timeless charm is its original fashion to deal with a historical moment, the relationship between individuals and even the mental events of a person at the same time and in the same equal eye. Thus ""Casablanca"" moves fluently from the general to the particular and back. Best known example is of course the beginning: the camera drills down into the globe, to Europe, to Casablanca, to Rick's Cafe Americain and finally to the privacy of Rick's mind. A conflict of reality and consciousness at the stage of the world, the café. As said innumerable times, the café is the microcosm of the world, of Europe at war. <br/><br/>""Casablanca"" was something that could only happen at one brief moment in the history of mankind. It is a work that was born from many factors which are forever admired such as Ingrid Bergman's natural beauty, Humphrey Bogart's powerful presence, his unique way of saying ""here's looking at you, kid,"" and an inimitable mood of solidarity. All this among many other things is veritably moving. The magical atmosphere and the mythical birth of ""Casablanca"" seem to capture the essence of an era, of a history. While it was being made there was no knowing who was going to win the war or how it all was going to end, but at least the many creators of this film had actual faith in a better tomorrow. <br/><br/>So what else can be said? Something coherent, something persuasive, something original? Nothing, I guess. All words seem to make ""Casablanca"" sound like a banal work of sentimentality which it only transcends. Watch it -- over and over again, and again and again. And once more."

","I never get tired of this film - no matter how many times I've seen it. And every player in this film - from S.Z. Sakall and Dooley Wilson to Bogart, Claude Rains, Paul Henreid and Ingrid Bergman - is absolutely brilliant. More emotion you'll never see in a film - for my money. These actors are fully vested in this film and more complex and nuanced performances you'll never see. Every aspect of this film is genius - from the story to the cinematography (and...I'm not sure...but could one argue that this was the very first and very best example of the film noire genre - does this qualify? It certainly sets the standard.) The tension is palpable, the dialog crackles with wit and intensity...for my money this is impossible to top. And it stays taught right to the very end...and who could argue that the very last line isn't the very best and most memorable in film history (in a film replete with memorable lines)? It's a great romance, a great thriller, a great War movie...it succeeds on so many levels - most EVERY level. And it is so riveting! It thrills from start to finish. And these are characters that not only love people and truly love each other, which makes you care all the more about their fates. These are characters you fall in love with and come to admire deeply, for the heroism they display in the face of almost insurmountable odds. (Can anyone not be moved by Sam's devotion to his bristly boss, Rick? That relationship defines the word ""true friend."" I had a friend like that once - they do exist - but they are a rare breed...and how moving is it to see this kind of thing in action in Casablanca?!) These characters are examples for us all - and though imaginary, they are recreations of real heroes who existed at the time and defeated the forces of evil in World War II. Bogie fans, of course, will love this film (it is arguably his finest...which is saying a lot, since his performances in The Treasure of Sierra Madre, Key Largo and many other films were brilliant too), as will Ingrid Bergman fans (her performance here rivals her performance in Notorious)...but you don't have to be a fan of any of them to recognize their greatness in Casablanca. (Peter Lorre deserves a mention too - his work here is memorable and noteworthy; it's a shame he wasted his great talent in too many lesser films afterward - except, of course, for The Maltese Falcon, his re-pairing with Bogie - which made for a wonderful chemistry.)

It was that song brought them together and tore them apart. However, it was the greatest love of all. Though their bodies were separated, there hearts were attached together forever and ever. Although Ilsa left Rick again, they were never far from each other. The best lover never asked anything. The only thing they hope is the one that they love is in happiness.

The plot is engaging, constantly moving and turning.<br/><br/>The acting is uniformly excellent. Bogart is the center of the movie, offering that classic jaded white knight Bogie. Bergman gives one of her best performances as well. Even small roles are beautifully done; Peter Lorre makes every second of his time on screen count. As for Claude Raines, he is so utterly perfect that he would have stolen the movie entirely if he hadn't been up against Bogie.<br/><br/>All that being said, I love some parts of Casablanca more than others. The early scenes are incredible, the finale is genius, but the Paris scenes, while necessary, feel a little slack, and Paul Henreid is a little bland for a charismatic resistance fighter. <br/><br/>But those are minor quibbles.

Many are transients trying to get out of Europe; a few are just trying to make a buck. Most of them -- gamblers and refugees, Nazis, resistance fighters, and plain old crooks -- find their way to Rick's Café Américain, a swank nightclub owned by American expatriate Rick Blaine (Humphrey Bogart). Though we learn later that Rick once harboured enough idealism to put himself at risk to fight fascism, he's now embittered and cynical, professing to be neutral and detached: ""I stick my neck out for nobody.""<br/><br/>What i love about this film is Humphrey Bogart. His ability to put himself firmly in a role and believe in it is extraordinary. I think Rick Blaine is one of the most cool and charming characters on the screen. Ilsa is also a true beauty on the screen. You can really feel for the love between Rick & Ilsa and how they will die for each other if it became possible. But in the end, their love can conquer all only not together and that is one of the most touching scenes in cinema when they have their final conversation.<br/><br/>The ending stands out as one of the best in Cinema.

I don't know that much of his personal life, but his contribution the classic days of movies is undeniable. Casablanca should be required watching in film school. The films now a day just seem to descend into gratuitous violence, sex and profanity. Each film seems to need to out do the previous when it comes to explosions. Some films makers should look back and review the classics like Casablanca and maybe be a renegade film maker and not give in to the Holly Wood lowered expectations. Mr. Bogart's delivery of sarcasm is second to none. And what he had to do for the woman he loved in the move. His to classic lines that still resonate even to this day, usually miss quoted, but there are still here. 1943 is long gone and the world has moved on, we have new dangers in the world, but the fad in movies is use bigger guns that expel more bullets. Writes of today could use a little education on imagination: one man with a .45, dry whit and a vocabulary void of any f-bombs can be very entertaining."

","This is the perfect movie.<br/><br/>Everything, from the script to the actors and the setting, screams quality.<br/><br/>The script is the tightest I've ever seen; not a word is wasted, and entire stretches of dialog are quotable more than 50 years later.<br/><br/>I enjoy each actor that shows up on the screen, from Humphrey Bogart as the nightclub owner Rick to Peter Lorre doing his best as a local lowlife.<br/><br/>The music, provided by Dooley Wilson, is memorable even today. For many films of that era, the songs lasted about as long as the next movie in the theater, so this is quite an accomplishment.<br/><br/>Overall, this is the best movie I've ever seen."
"vickramjsingh","10","2","3","28 July 2013"," Great Film
","This film is great because it gives the viewer a look into a period in history through the eyes of an ordinary man, a hero, a soldier, a woman and someone in love. It is simple and yet impossible to grasp at times and can be watched over and over again. The actors play their roles amazingly and leave the viewer speechless at times. This is one love story that can never be pushed to the side as a chick flick because any guy would like this movie as well. A real masterpiece in cinema. Personally, I appreciate and enjoy movies that are simple and not too long, but they still leave you breathless and wanting to watch them again when they are finished. Casablanca is a great movie that allows the viewer to personally take a stake in the plot and watch as events leave them sad, horrified, heartbroken and elated at the same time. I would recommend this movie to anyone of all ages."
"RyanCShowers","Null","2","3","25 July 2013"," Closest Thing To Perfection Possible At The Movies
","The first five minutes of Casablanca can be daunting to the viewer. So daunting that they may turn it off all together and go about their day. That's what happened to me my first time, trying to sit through Casablanca. I didn't walk away because I was bored by it, or uninterested in what laid ahead, it was the fear of something so beloved not holding up to its reputation or flying over my head completely. Thankfully, I returned to Casablanca and I'm forever thankful I did because it's one of the best films ever made.<br/><br/>In film schools, I'm sure Casablanca is the number one film analyzed for those future filmmakers waiting to make their mark on the industry. If it's not, it ought be. Casablanca delivers on every level technically, it's flawlessly constructed. It was made in the old-school Hollywood period where making movies like working in a factory, each part of the movie was put together by a specific person performing a specific task. The care and exertion put in by the set designer, costume coordinator, sound technician are all seen painted on the black and white, cinematography, which is my favorite part of the movie. The best photography ever put on film, playing with different camera angles, lighting, and emotional involvement like no film before it.<br/><br/>The direction is the other driving force behind Casablanca that makes it a movie that stood the test of time. Director, Michael Curtiz, juggles all the topics covered in the brilliant script making them feel effortlessly collected. He creates a swift, moving picture. Casablanca is the movie that defines great movie montages. The writing nails the contrast of love and war, which creates a finely tuned script. Humphrey Bogart and Ingird Bergman establish the precedent of war films being romantic and ""the"" movie couple of all-time. <br/><br/>Casablanca depicts the wartime world better than any film you'll ever find. Its romance has sparks that still fly today and the political back dealings of World War II play like a new story we would watch at this present time. Casablanca is about sacrifice and studies the character of Humphrey Bogart, as if the man's heart was speaking to directly to the audience. Being produced in 1942 without the technological advances today, the quality of the mechanical areas involved stunned me. It's an exceptional story that breathes long after its expiration date. <br/><br/>Rating: 10/10<br/><br/>Grade: A+"
"stefan_epangeac","10","2","3","22 June 2013"," The best movie ever made
","For me, the 40s and the 70s are are my favorite movie periods. I should include the 30s also. It is the period of the greatest scripts, they are great even in our days, and also the period of the coolest actors ever to appear on screen. Humphrey Bogart is one of them, and Casablanca is the film that shined most in the 40s. Casablanca has the best script including legendary lines i think 6 of them are included in AFI top 100 lines. It' not just a love story, it's that love story that seems impossible, due to the time when the characters met, and the circumstances in witch they feel in love. Probably, the best scene in the movie is the one with ""la Marseillaise"". It has such deep signification, it's the French national anthem played in a French region in Africa under German occupation during WW II, played while the Germans sang a patriotic song. The scene is presented in great detail, from the beginning, where the band look to Bogart for his approval, to Victor Laszlo' hand gestures and Ilsa's heavy breathing suggesting that she is proud of Laszlo's intention, to the end when a a woman in the crowd with a visible tear shouts ""Vive La France"". The song starts in a shy matter for the French crowd, but it increases immediately and the German are forced to stop singing because they can not be heard anymore. It has the meaning of freedom, of liberty. When you watch this scene you feel good, you think of what the public though when it was first released; back then the war was still on; maybe they though that the war will be over that the good will eventually conquer evil. To conclude, watch this movie, you will love it, you will love the French anthem scene even if you are not French. You will not find a better script or better actors."
"greggs_nbacon","10","2","3","4 June 2013"," Simply Timeless
","Casablanca is a film that never loses one bit of any emotion or wit that it was originally written with. This classic tale of romance contains the timeless theme of the nearly hopeless struggle of getting over that one ex that still captivates you, even though you ended poorly. Bogart gives the performance of a lifetime as Richard Blaine. There's a real sense of bitterness and dismay that no other actor could come close to capturing. Ingrid Bergman becomes one of the most beautiful creatures to ever grace the screen as the breathtaking Ilsa Lund. you can really see her heart breaking throughout the movie in the way her eyes move as she tries to pick between her husband, Victor Lazlo (Paul Henreid who gives a great performance as the well respected war hero), and her former lover, who now has become a crotchety old drunk. Claude Raines steals every scene he is in, and offers some of the snappiest dialogue ever seen in film. This is by far one of the greatest films ever made."
"FourStarFilmFan","10","2","3","22 May 2013"," Casablanca (1942)
","Considered one of the greatest films of all-time this well-loved classic deserves to be here. It is the hallmark of Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman's careers. It has one of the greatest scripts of all time and it has achieved legendary status over the years. Many consider it purely the best film ever made and in all honesty, I would never try to refute that. <br/><br/>This film holds such a tremendous presence in movie history it is amazing. Upon seeing the movie it made complete sense what all the hype was about. What more could you want than Bogey, Bergman, Casablanca, and some of the greatest quotes ever said? Do not forget the the French Captain Louis played by Claude Rains or the immortal tune of As Time Goes By. This movie has conflict and the uncertainty of war practically in every scene. We have a rogue gallery of everybody under the sun from Peter Lorre and Sidney Greenstreet to German soldiers. There is a broken romance and a forlorn hero who shows his courage in the end. If you take into consideration when this movie was made, it truly is wonderful to watch. You do not need explosions and violence only great characters and a story with both drama and humor. Up until the final moments of the movie you are captivated the entire time. Then fittingly you are left with the two men walking off into the night with the words, ""Louis I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship."""
"phbasketball6","10","2","3","5 May 2013"," Possibly the Greatest Romance Movie of All-Time
","One of the best romance movies of all-time. Casablanca made Humphrey Bogart a top star in Hollywood and Ingrid Bergman a respectable actress. Claude Rains is also great in the movie and is an important character. Michael Curtiz, who I believe is one of the greatest directors of all-time, directs this the same year as Yankee Doodle Dandy. Curtiz direction was flawless and the close-ups mainly on Bergmann shown the emotions were great. The cinematography was astounding which makes the viewer seem like they're in the room. Despite the screenplay not being 100% realistic and believable, I don't think anyone cares because of how well and effective the movie is. The dialog is one of the best in cinema history which contains many famous quotes. This movie shows how important romance, friendship, and politics could be. <br/><br/>The beginning introduces Rick (Bogart) who owns ""Rick's Café Américain"" which is a nightclub and a place for gambling located in Casablanca which is in Northern Africa.. Usually the Vichy French, Italian, and Nazi officials go there. Rick looks like a professional businessman but seems depress for a reason we do not know. <br/><br/>Ugarte (Peter Lorre), a petty criminal, arrives in Rick's club with ""letters of transit"" obtained through the murder of two German couriers. The papers allow the person to travel freely around German-controlled Europe and to neutral Portugal, and from there to America. Ugarte plans to make his money by selling them to the highest bidder. However that does not work out according to plan and Rick ends up with the letters. <br/><br/>Eventually Ilsa (Bergman) comes in with a man and Sam (Dooley Wilson) notices this and is not thrilled. She asks if Rick is there and Sam doesn't her to see Rick. She tells Sam to play ""As Time Goes By."" Sam seeming like he doesn't want to plays it anyway which angers Rick. Rick then realizes Ilsa is there and seems upset and happy at the same time. It is realized that the man with her was her husband Victor Laszlo (Henreid). Laszlo is refugee that is trying to go to America. <br/><br/>Later that night Rick seems really upset about seeing her again and Sam tries to comfort him. While they are talking flashbacks are shown about Rick and Ilsa as lovers in Paris. While in Paris Rick had to flee and Ilsa plans to go with him however the minute that he leaves Sam gives him the letter from her saying she won't. <br/><br/>Ilsa basically broke Rick's heart but now needs help along with her husband. Many viewers question who is going to get Ilsa, Rick or Victor? Is Rick going to help Ilsa after what she did to him?"
"bigcahs93","9","2","3","2 May 2013"," An American staple that stands as a timeless classic
","Casablanca is a 1942 romantic drama directed by Michael Curtiz, staring Humphrey Bogart as Rick Blaine and Ingrid Bergman as Ilsa Lund. In the realm of American films, Casablanca is as well regarded as Gandhi or Einstein, and for good reason. You can make the argument about the films political messages regarding the time period, but nothing overall hinders the movie, in my opinion. Like most other movies of the time, the cinematography is excellent, not very exciting but well made none the less. Curtiz also uses dark lighting in an excellent way, in fact one could make the argument that this film is total film noir because of Curtiz's obsession with shadows. Otherwise, in terms of content, nothing else about the movie really stands out, with maybe the exception of the mini airfield they made for the movie. What keeps Casablanca as a hallmark in our collective movie going memory is the love story. With the exception of the part where Rick just casually asks Ilsa if she wanted to get married, a truly boss move on Bogart's part, the love story feels very natural, and realistic. Even a violence craving, Scorsese/Tarantino loving person like myself can't help but feel the plight of Rick and Ilsa, two humans in an extreme rut. 9/10"
"zthaleb","10","2","3","29 April 2013"," A Classic
","Casablanca is the all time classic love story (besides Romeo & Juliet). The romance in this movie has everything. For people watching this movie for the first time without knowing anything about it will be shocked to see what happens at the end. I know I was the first time I saw this movie! At first it upset me because I wanted there to be a happy ending, but after realizing what Rick had done for Ilsa it made me so happy! The acting was amazing in this; very believable and very smooth. I think Humphery Bogart was really amazing in this movie. He played his character very well and made the character relatable! His character did a lot of developing in the movie as well! I would recommend this movie to any one! Such a great film!"
"BatmanAndRobyn","10","2","3","13 March 2013"," Obvious Instant Classic!
","Prior to seeing this in it's entirety, I'd only seen the closing scene where the plane is taking off and Bogart's infamous quote is spoken.<br/><br/>Needless to say, this film was fantastic. The characters and acting were flawless. The story line includes a love story of epic proportions and shows the audience what war and invasions can do to a relationship. It tears it apart. Also, for some reason, I really liked Sam's storyline-- I found him to be a very interesting minor character.<br/><br/>The use of one sided, low-lighting was present throughout and helped make some of the scenes seem a bit more dramatic. I also found myself admiring the photography from beginning to end. You could pause that movie at almost any spot and it could easily be used as a still frame or photograph. Still frames alone would be able to tell this story, obviously not as great as the film though. The cinematography and photography were absolutely beautiful."
"tyonkers1234","10","2","3","13 March 2013"," Well worthy of being a classic film
","Casablanca is easily one of the most famous movies of all time, so I had high expectations while watching it. As I expected, it did not disappoint in the slightest. The characters were great, the sets and accompanying visual elements were stellar, and it even gave me feelings of stress and fear concerning the Nazis. The storyline sucks you right in and stays that way until the famous end scene. The portrayal of the stress and fear that was overtaking Europe at this time was spot on and the personification of American neutrality in the main character, Rick Blaine, while everyone else needs his help is absolutely perfect. Overall, this movie is great and seems like the type of movie that gets better with each time you watch it."

","Seeing this movie for the first time in the 21st century, I asked myself, ""Well...was it as great as expected?"". I'd have to go with a yeah, sure! The movie was interesting. Was it the best movie I ever saw in my life? Uhh, not really. The main thing is that is kept me captivated (almost forgot I was watching it) and I was able to relate to parts of the film. When a movie is able to do that, create a relatable feeling for its audiences, then it's a winner. Casablanca was a real love story. Not this fluff that we see now a days that have the same concept and the same story line. I loved this films mise-en-scene. The props and effects used made the setting seem so real. There was great use of invisibility. Even though the scenes were not shot overseas, it kind of made you forget where they really were shooting."
"bcaulford","Null","2","3","13 March 2013"," Great cinematography
","This was a very good movie that highlighted an important part in history. There were many French citizens attempting to flee to America during World War II and in this film many were forced to stay in Casablanca waiting for a plane to take them there. During this period in time it was uncertain as to who would win the war. The photography in this film was awesome; there were many great lighting details and there was never a point where it was too dark where it covered actors and actresses faces. I noticed that shadows were especially never cast on female actresses faces and it was always shooting at the main actress, Ingrid Bergman, from the left side. This was great because her eyes were always glistening when the light was hitting her from that side. Even in Ricks cafe the lighting seemed natural as if you were sitting right in that very room watching everything take place. Overall this was a good movie with a good plot with great lighting and cinematography."
"kylebristol12","10","2","3","11 March 2013"," A Little Something for Everyone
","At one point or another, every film lover has heard someone utter one of the many infamous quotes from ""Casablanca"". Lines like ""Here's looking at you, kid"", or ""Louis, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship"", have entered American culture and become part of the language. The reason the film is so popular, even among modern audiences, is because of how personal the subject matter was to audiences - and the cast, too - at the time the film was released. It truly is a film for everyone. The cast features Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman in the leading roles, and is supported by an array of incredible character actors including Claude Rains, Peter Lorre, Paul Henreid, and Dooley Wilson. These actors don't just put on a spectacle for the viewer to watch; they create an organic, multi-faceted, and culturally diverse community. Rick's nightclub is home to this community where secrets are kept hidden – or discovered – and people are forced to decide where there loyalties lie. ""Casablanca"" deserves a point all its own on the timeline of American film history. It's romance and it's drama; it is an uplifting comedy and a geopolitical thriller. No matter how you describe it, it is a piece of history."

Max Steiner's music and Owen Marks' edited create a taut and always lovable cinematic experience.

","Casablanca is a 1942 romance/drama movie that focuses on a man named Rick who takes refugee in Casablanca where he then runs a famous saloon and a young lady with whom he shared an affair with once named Iilsa. The film follows the story of Iilsa, who is desperate to get out of Casablanca for her husband's safety and Rick, her former lover who secretly has these letters that will help him get anywhere.<br/><br/>Casablanca came out an year after the 'greatest movie of all time' Citizen Kane. I strongly believe that this movie is far superior to Citizen Kane in every way possible. This movie is one of the greatest movies ever made and deserves to be crowned the greatest motion picture of all time Everything in this film works brilliantly. The story works extremely well including the plot of the stolen documents as well as characters like Louis and Victor Lazlo. The characters in this movie are so much more interesting than that in Citizen Kane and the greatest thing about this movie is easily the romance and the amazing chemistry between Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman. That was a phenomenal relationship to which we are emotionally drawn in. It is as if our souls during the movie get sucked into the drama that is going on.<br/><br/>Citizen Kane being a movie of around the same duration as Casablanca felt far longer than Casablanca. The acting in the movie was just brilliant and the way the film was brilliantly directed and written just made the film all the better.<br/><br/>There were so many powerful scenes in the movie especially the scene where a drunk Rick has a flashback to him and Iilsa's relationship. That to me, is some phenomenal film making which immediately made me love the characters more and more.<br/><br/>The film to me was extremely emotional, extremely interesting and in the end, I just wanted much more. I don't normally say that to movies but this movie made me wish there was so much more going on.<br/><br/>In conclusion, Casablanca is an absolute must see as the film is flawless and absolutely remarkable in every possible way."

What really makes the movie is the importance and urgency of the time that the film is set -- for all the characters in this story, for this one small gin joint and this one very obscure city, for all of Europe and all the world. What is particularly important is the desperation of this moment in history. It is brilliantly boiled down into a tableau of detailed interwoven personal stories of greed, power and need, love and sacrifice, loyalty and betrayal. <br/><br/>The acting is flawless across the board with these iconic actors really shinning; the screenplay dialogue is smart, witty, with hardly an unnecessary word; the direction and cinematography are flawless, with each scene framed like a movie poster; and the musical numbers contribute the environment and the emotional gravitas without making the film be contrived.

It has so many different great themes such as politics, romance and comedy. The chemistry between Rick and Isla is fantastic and believable.

I love Rick as the anti-hero being the good guy but doesn't wear spandex and jump off buildings he's the guy that makes things happen. Ultimately giving up everything for the cause. Having such a heavy undertone leaves room to have a little comedy mixed in. The little one liners thrown in are so perfectly planned and in good taste.

""Of all the gin joints in all the towns in all the world she walks into mine"".<br/><br/>These famous lines are just a few amongst the many memorable lines in the 1942 blockbuster Casablanca that was re-released Wednesday, March 21st to commemorate the monster classic's 70th anniversary. I was not about to wait for Casablanca's 100th Anniversary screening to see the hit movie on the big screen so I purchased a ticket to enter a silver screen time portal to view the film the way it was meant to be seen.on the big screen. Unfortunately, the prices of the ticket, the popcorn and the soda did not go back in time but if there is a movie that is worth every cent of admission and snacks it is Casablanca.<br/><br/>For the very few of you who are not familiar with the plot of Casablanca here is a very brief synopsis of the classic. It is WWII and Casablanca is a haven for refugees who are escaping the stronghold of the Nazi military in eastern Europe. Escapees are willing to do whatever it takes to Get from Eastern Europe to Casablanca, Morocco to Lisbon, Portugal and finally, to absolute freedom in America. Rick's Americain Cafe is a hotbed of political corruption and refugee deal making in the tumultuous city of Casablanca. As interesting and complex the goings ons at Rick's may be it really just serves as a sub-plot to one of the most famous love affairs in movie history between the beautiful Ilsa Lund played by Ingrid Bergman and the timeless, cool, calm and collected Rick Blaine who owns Rick's Americain Cafe played by, of course, Humphrey Bogart.<br/><br/>I am not going to waste your time by going any further with the plot summary of this movie but I will say that with each time I see this phenomenon of a movie I am more and more amazed by the screen writing of Philip and Julius Epstein with Howard Koch. Incredible as the performances that are given by Peter Lorre(Ugarte), Claude Rains (Capt. Renault), Paul Henried (Victor Laszlo), Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman the ingenious screen writing of the Epsteins and Koch cannot be overlooked. To write a screenplay that embodies the beautiful complexities of love and the heinous complexities of WW2 politics is truly a feat of artistic genius displayed by the Epstein's and Koch. As the old saying goes, they don't make movies like this anymore.<br/><br/>Unfortunately time portals are not yet a reality but a movie theater is a great place to escape to another time, especially if you are seeing a classic like Casablanca. For those of you who have not seen Casablanca on the big screen please do not miss the next chance you have to do so. Here's to Casablanca being played again Sam.<br/><br/>Like what you see here?

","Let's not rehash the old accolades of Bogie & Bergman which still ring true. I watch this over and over because it represents a type of commitment and honor that I believe we all wish we were capable of. The dialog is full of the utmost courtesy, while the humor can bob and weave into the script that still manages to pull the romance through the end. The side characters are very strong, if not stereotypically played out, but ultimately memorable, none the less. Of all the quotes that echo, it is Ricks' heartbreak and bitterness wrapped up in his replying if he remembered Ilsa, ""The Germans wore gray, you wore blue."" War, romance, humor and dignity and all in seven words, that's class!"

","Casablanca is truly a fantastic demonstration of cinematic storytelling. Physically speaking, the film is beautifully constructed. The cinematography is consistently fluid and makes great use of both high-key and low-key lighting. The set design is seemingly flawless, as is the acting, particularly the performances delivered by leads Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman. Above all else, I think the writing made Casablanca the classic film that it is. There are countless quotable lines, and the film (and specific scenes) has been parodied into oblivion. The editing in Casablanca continues to contribute to the film's soundness. Various techniques employed severely impact the quality of the storytelling, particularly the film's famous flashback. A+ all around."

Most importantly, it juxtaposes what we want as viewers and what's actually the right thing to do in a way few movies do.<br/><br/>In short, even if you've received most of the plot and scenes through cultural osmosis, Casablanca is still worth watching, if only for that heart-wrenching climax."

He found that it is not going to end and decides to pick his side: against the Nazis.

That helps I guess, but it isn't necessary to know if a film is good or not. I liked it, a lot. It started off pretty unspectacular, but it does sort of give you a spin and it does let you accommodate to the characters after a while. I thought the standout was Ingrid Bergman, and I am surprised to see she wasn't even nominated.

"GoodBen","Null","2","3","16 October 2011"," Review for Casablanca
","Growing up, I'd heard a lot about this movie, but I've never actually seen it. Now that I have, I understand why Casablanca is so well liked. It has a strong, suspenseful plot, excellent acting, an exotic setting, great dialogue, and many humorous moments. Maybe it's best thought of as a drama/romance. It tells the story of two former lovers, America expatriate, and bar owner, Rick Blaine (Humphrey Bogart) and Ilsa Lund (Ingrid Bergman), who meet again and find themselves in a love triangle with the woman's husband, Victor Laszlo, leader of the Czech underground. It's set in the city of Casablanca in unoccupied North Africa during WWII. While the war actually hasn't reached Casablanca, the city is full of Nazi soldiers, who create a constant sense of menace and dread. They're after Laszlo, and he and Ilsa need to escape. In order to do that, they need transit papers. Rick has the papers and needs to decide what to do with them. The story is filled with moments of edge of the seat suspense as we wonder if Laszlo and Ilsa will escape or become victims of the Nazi's. We also wonder if Ilsa will stay with Rick or choose her husband. The acting is excellent. Bogart's Rick is a complex man with a past. A former freedom fighter himself, he's become a jaded man who claims not to care about anyone but himself. Bergman's Ilsa is obviously torn between Rick and her husband. The viewer is faced with asking if Rick will do the right thing and who Ilsa will choose. The movie is made even better by the frequently humorous moments, many offered by Captain Renault (Claude Rains), who does an excellent job as the cynical and corrupt head of the local police. From beginning to end, I found this film to be totally enjoyable."

","You cannot talk about all-time greatest movies without having ""Casablanca"" somewhere in the top 10. At least, until enough time goes by that the fundamental things don't apply! (Sorry.) In all seriousness, it pains me to think that there may come a time when this movie, shot in black-and-white and with nary a special effect and with all the limitations of the technology of its time (1942), will seem so primitive and unnatural that instead of being a classic, it will be considered a curiosity. That will be a very sad time indeed.<br/><br/>Bogie and Bergman are immortal, not just because of this film, but I cannot imagine a time when people who see ""Casablanca"" will fail to be affected by their story in the film. Bergman is indelibly and incredibly beautiful, completely believable as the woman caught between two men that she loves equally in very different ways. Bogie is the man that women want to be with, the man that men want to be: smart, suave, completely cool, admired and respected by everyone and feared by those who have a reason to fear him. And in this place called ""Casablanca,"" with the world crashing into war around them, they play out a story that's both intensely personal and yet universal.<br/><br/>The mythology that's sprung up about this movie is a story unto itself, and maybe some day someone will write a movie about that. Suffice it to say that the way the pieces came together, you have to believe that this was as movie that was meant to be.<br/><br/>""Casablanca"" was made back in the days when movies and live plays were pretty much the ""only games in town"" when it came to entertainment (other than sports), and since every small town had a movie theater but only big cities had live plays, EVERYONE went to the movies. I don't think young people who have so many options for entertainment now can quite understand what a big deal a movie like this was, and how beloved and what a stir it created. I hope that because so much of the dialogue in the movie is so well-known, maybe they'll get a feel for just how large this movie looms in American culture.<br/><br/>I love it. It was on TCM yesterday, and I watched it for what must be the twentieth time, and I still love it and can watch it without getting tired of it. Bogie and Bergman, forever luminous and forever saying good-bye there at the airport in a place called Casablanca. It never gets old and I never get tired of it."
"Kubris","9","2","3","5 June 2011"," A classic of classics
","Well, after sitting on my shelf for years, I finally watched Casablanca. As a young movie viewer, I have little experience with black-and-white films, so I was a little unprepared for what would happen next.<br/><br/>Casablanca is a Rom-dram set in Africa during World War II. It was also made during World War II, during a period of heavy fighting. Nowadays, it's like a time capsule from the most violent period in modern history. But enough with the history, and on with the film.<br/><br/>The first half hour was very faced paced, plot wise. Lots happened quickly, demanding your full attention. A viewer has to pay very close attention to figure out what's happening. However, it does slow down into a more gently paced movie. I'm not sure if that happens with all old movies, but very rarely nowadays will so much happen at the beginning of a film.<br/><br/>The acting is great. Rick's presence on screen is felt by all, Humphrey Bogart did an unrepeatable job as the stern yet sentimental hero. Everyone else plays their roles well, but it was hard for me to really tell what is and isn't good because acting has changed over the years. It seems that old movies have very dialogue-based acting, whereas new movies have action-based acting.<br/><br/>Speaking of dialogue, it becomes very apparent that Casablanca's is special. There's a reason it has the most number of famous lines on AFI's 100 lines list. But that's all I can say about that.<br/><br/>Lastly, the plot. *No spoilers* After the first 25 minutes, the plot becomes coherent and the story is very enjoyable. The pacing is very good, so the film never drags. The ending is very nice, and the buildup to it has several twists, some you will see coming, others you won't.<br/><br/>Ultimately, Casablanca is a classic film any cinema aficionado should see. 8.8/10"
"hrsvelgr","Null","2","3","13 May 2011"," A film that deserves all of the praise it gets.
","Casablanca is a romantic drama in a World War II setting that contains aspects that ultimately make it one of the greatest films ever made. The effective use of the drama and the development of each character makes the film a stunning example of how a movie should be made. The most impressive visual aspect (of which this review is mostly centered) is the lighting work found in the movie. The lighting ultimately sets the tone and mood for the film in a variety of scenes and is sometimes used just to impress the viewer. Early in the film a spotlight pans over our lead character, Rick, which helps expand upon the setting of a Nazi occupied and policed territory. There is also the scene in which we view Rick's shadow tinkering with and removing money from his safe. This allows us to feel imposed by Rick's presence and feel as if we are intruding upon his time. Mood is set extremely well with lighting in the scenes where Rick is drinking and remembering his past with Ilsa. The past seems bright and positive while the current seems much darker and the feeling of remorse and regret is played effectively while Rick is at the bar. Perhaps the best example of lighting enhancing a scene's mood and tone is when Ilsa appears in the café at night and the entire room lights up with her appearance, as if it was being produced by her. These uses of lighting enhance the film incredibly and engross the audience entirely. Light work aside ""Casablanca"" is an incredible film that more modern films should take notes from. It is without a doubt one of the best films ever made and no amount of praise can properly justify the unbelievable quality of the film."

","Until recently I've never seen ""Casablanca""(1942). The only thing I could tell you about it was that Humphrey Bogart was in it and there was a scene on a foggy airfield somewhere. Other than that I just thought it was some good classic film that simply got over hyped like so many others. Within 30 minutes of the movie I could clearly see I was mistaken. The story, acting, and sets were all fantastic but what really won me over was the amazing cinematography work by Arthur Edeson. Especially the scenes shot in ""Rick's Café Américain"". The use of lighting and shadows was fantastic and gave this film a sort of film noir precursor feel. This film knows exactly when to let information go at exactly the right time and when to add a little comic relief when things start to get tense; whither it be the delight wit and charm of Bogart or the antics of Szőke Szakáll. ""Casablanca""(1942) will keep you guessing with whats going to happen with the characters facing many moral dilemmas and you not knowing if their going to take the high or low road. This was one amazing film that lived up to its hype and for that I give it a 10-10"
"charlytully","10","2","3","19 April 2011"," Holds its own against most Shakespeare plays
","Looking at the list or compilation here on IMDb of notable quotes from the film CASABLANCA, I was reminded of at least 28 sayings that have become part of the American lexicon or our shared cultural literacy in the nearly 7 decades since this movie's release (a time period similar to the one that Abraham Lincoln observed had elapsed between the Declaration of Independence and his own Gettysburg Address). The 30-odd plays attributed to William Shakespeare have some advantages over CASABLANCA in terms of grasping ""market share"" in our collective mentality: namely, they've had six times as long to take root in our imaginative vocabulary, which consequently has yielded far more adaptations (think current release GNOMEO AND JULIET) than time has proffered to the script which earned screen writing Oscars for the Epstein twins. On the other hand, only serious Shakespeare scholars would be able to identify two dozen memorable turns of phrase from the entire body of the bard's work, and many of these professorial types probably would be stumped to repeat ANY bon mot from 10 or 20 of the lesser known plays (all of which necessarily suffer from archaic words or meanings caused by the passage of the centuries). As stated in the quote section here, some CASABLANCA trademarks (""Here's looking at you, kid"") predate the movie, while other famous lines (""Play it again, Sam"") have been ""edited"" for conciseness in the public mind. Back in school, I learned enough about Shakespeare to know the exact same thing applies to most of his famous one-liners: he was primarily popularizing stories and sayings that predated the dramas performed under his brand. (Much of the foregoing also could be applied to biblical scholarship, but I will leave it to the next reviewer to extrapolate between CASABLANCA and comparative religion.)<br/><br/>More likely than not, the works of Shakespeare will be much more obscure 100 years from now, while phrases and images from such movies as GONE WITH THE WIND and THE WIZARD OF OZ will be even more iconic then compared with now. But I have no doubt that CASABLANCA will remain right at the top in terms of defining how Americans think, speak, and remember a common lingo."

","There is nothing I can say about Michael Curtiz's masterwork Casablanca(1942)that hasn't already been said by thousands, perhaps millions, of cinema lovers over the past 70 years. There aren't enough superlatives in the dictionary to describe just how perfectly the story, the characters, the images, the music, the sounds and all elements of the film's production are presented. The thing that sets Casablanca apart from the other films universally considered as being among the greatest of all time including Citizen Kane(1941) and The Godfather Part I(1972)and Part II(1974), among others, is the comedy of the piece. To balance the heart wrenching and soul shattering effects of war, occupation, fascism, betrayal and lost love with so much high quality comedy and so many great jokes is just stunning. Importantly, the comic elements disarm the audience without distracting from the life and death tension of the surroundings of the film. The emotions of the piece all feel very real and genuine and the audience is allowed into the lives of these characters in a way that very few films allow. Bogart's Rick is just about the coolest guy in the history of the world and Bergman's Ilsa it just about the most beautiful and charming woman in the history of the world. Claude Rains contributes a masterfully enigmatic performance as the police Captain Louis Renault and the entire cast of characters makes the place and the era come bursting to life. Curtiz's use of light and shadows sets the perfect tone for this perfect film and all elements of production are perfectly on point. I can't say for certain that Casablanca is the greatest film that has ever been made as I haven't seen them all but there's a pretty damn good chance that it is."

One of my favorite things about this movie was the lighting. the lights and darks brought an aesthetic contrast that tuned me into what was happening in the scene. I thought that the two main characters were perfectly fit for this movie. The protagonist, Rick has certain suave air to himself, which allows the audience to like him at first sight. His attitude shows neutrality with a hint of passion at the same time. Ilsa, the love interest, makes one see a different side to Rick. I would have to say the police captain was my favorite character due to the fact that he brought comic relief while staying in the realm of being serious. In my opinion, I find this movie's script to be one of the most well written pieces of all time. I recommend this movie to anyone that wants to see a true piece of art."

","Ingrid Bergman & Humprey Bogart co-star in this drama of early WW-II intrigue that was nominated for 8 Oscars (& won 3: best picture, screenplay, actor). Its supporting cast was magnificent and huge (Claude Rains, Paul Henreid, Conrad Veidt, Sydney Greenstreet, Peter Lorre, S.Z. Sakall, Dooley Wilson). ""Casablanca,"" at this moment, ranks #16 of IMDb's All Time Best 250 films and it's also on Roger Ebert's list of Great Movies.<br/><br/>It's a tale pitting those who are (or have been) active in resistance to the Nazis mixing with those who are just trying to survive by hook or crook AND officials of Nazi Germany as well as those French officials with mixed loyalties to occupied vs. unoccupied France. <br/><br/>Rick (Bogart) was active in the French resistance to the Nazis during which time he met and fell in love with Ilsa (Bergman). Hurriedly fleeing the Nazi occupation of Paris but feeling unexpectedly deserted by Ilsa's failure to accompany him, Rick's moved into a 'survivalist' mode in French Morocco. <br/><br/>Ilsa has a husband (Henreid) with whom she's reunited after believing him to be dead; the couple show up unintentionally, unexpectedly, in Rick's café, searching for passage to a safer place. <br/><br/>Claude Rains' performance, in his role as the head of French military/ security forces in Casblanca, gives THE most pivotal of all performances in elevating this film into its stellar level in the opinion of some (see comments to this effect in the Message Board for this film). After reading and reflecting on this, I fully agree.<br/><br/>IMO, Ebert's review is VERY worthwhile & helpful (see IMDb's ""External Reviews"" of this film, then click on Chicago Sun-Times/Ebert's). In that, among other things, we learn the narrative/dialog wasn't written until they filmed it so Bergman (& others) didn't know the outcome until it was actually shot.<br/><br/>Also, IMDb's Bio on Dooley Wilson (""Sam, the piano player""--see IMDb's ""Cast""/""bio"") shows us that his career took off after this movie. <br/><br/>Sam's music in the café was seamlessly integrated into the narrative and becomes, essentially, a great, additional, supporting cast member. <br/><br/>I don't recall Bergman ever being so lovely--but how in the world did women of that time pack and travel with those hats?"

","What can you say about an American film classic like Casablanca that hasn't already been said? I'm not sure, but as one of my favorite films, I'll give it a try. Most of the film Casablanca takes place in Rick's Café Americain – a nightclub in the Moroccan city of Casablanca that lends itself to people looking for a way to escape the Nazis; these can include refugees, gamblers, even crooks. Rick's is owned by Rick Blaine (Humphrey Bogart). Rick has gone to Casablanca to escape the Nazi's, a lost love and ""sticks his neck out for no one."" The plot centers on some letters of transit that have been given to Rick for safe keeping. The letters will allow the bearer to escape to the United States, and freedom. Unknown to Rick is that these papers are the reason that his lost love Ilsa Lund (Ingrid Bergman) and her husband Victor (Paul Henreid) find their way into Rick's nightclub. Rick is torn between using the papers for him to get out of Casablanca and take Ilsa with him, or give the papers to the couple, so that they can escape the Nazis. Also central to the story line is the song As Time Goes By, a song that was special to Ilsa and Rick during their romance in Paris. Rick has forbid Sam (Dooley Wilson) his piano player to play the song since Ilsa left him alone at the train station in Paris. When Ilsa and Victor come into the club, Ilsa convinces Sam to ""Play It Again Sam, Play It Again."" When Rick hears it, he is furious, until he sees who requested the song. Thus begins the revival of Rick and Ilsa's love affair. Even though by today's standards the scenery and special effects are outdated and at times seem corny, it doesn't detract from the charm, romance, mystery and allure of the story of the film. The lighting and camera angles used to shoot the film contribute to the mystery and allure of the city of Casablanca as well. This can specifically be seen in the lighting and camera angles used for the close-ups of Ilsa. The soft, diffused lighting on her face, gives her an almost angelic quality. The emotions are so evident in her expressions, especially her eyes. While watching this film, the lighting used, reminded me of another of Ingrid Bergman's later films, The Bells of St. Mary's. The lighting used seemed to be similar, and in The Bells of St. Mary's, Ms. Bergman played a nun, so she was angelic in a way. I found that the film Casablanca still held the same allure, mystery and romantic adventure after viewing it for the 20th time as it held the first time."

During business hours the restaurant is a happening place and these scenes were always loud, bright, high in contrast and flashy. The scenes in Rick's office and when the restaurant was closed were usually dark and quiet; feeling more personal. The focus of the camera also had a different feel while shooting certain characters. A soft focus was used while shooting Ingrid Bergman's character Ilsa, making her even more gorgeous.<br/><br/>The ending of Casablanca is really quite amazing because it is meant to feel incomplete.

Certainly they didn't believe their film would go on to become one of the most beloved in cinema history.<br/><br/>""Casablanca"" is one of those movies that holds up so well because it has appeal to a broad variety of audience members. The movie's basic plot is a love triangle set in French Morocco in World War II. But it's so much more than that. It's a story about patriotism, about the defiance of Nazism, about the struggle of humankind's search for glory and freedom, it's a satirical and witty drama, its packed with characters so fleshed-out and strong that you couldn't forget them if you wanted to forget them.<br/><br/>I think you get the picture. And this is not a review coming from someone who just wants to jump on the bandwagon and praise what people like to call one of the greatest movies of all time. Because I don't have to pretend. ""Casablanca"" really *is* that good. From start to finish, the whole picture of full of instantly memorable moments, lines of dialogue such as ""Round up the usual suspects!"" and ""Here's looking at you, kid."" that just lingers in your conscious for the rest of your days.<br/><br/>But here's the ultimate reason why ""Casablanca"" has succeeded so well. This is one of those pictures that you can watch over and over again and never become tired of. Even after you know the entire story and have the entire movie practically memorized as I have, it's impossible to become sick of. Even after so many decades of existence, the movie has aged tremendously well and it's just as wonderful and enduring as it was when it was first released.<br/><br/>Usually in my reviews I like to describe the power of certain moments of certain films, but I will abstain in this case because I don't want to give away the movie for those who have never had the privilege to see ""Casablanca."" But I will say this. Roger Ebert's definition of a classic is the quintessential way to describe ""Casablanca"" for it's also for me a film I couldn't bear the idea of never seeing again.<br/><br/>""Of all the gin joints in all the towns in all the worldshe walks into mine.""

","Casablanca has always been one of my favorite movies. It is a bit cliqued, but perhaps it was not that way when it was first released, but over the years the lines have been repeated so much that it has become that way. This is a wonderful, complex story, which is one of the things I like about it and other movies with great plots. But it was not too confusing. There were things that I had not noticed on previous viewings, one of which is the use of lighting. I found myself wondering what it meant when they showed Rick's shadow much larger than himself in one scene. Did it mean that he was a mere shadow of himself after Elsa left him alone at the train station? I've never really paid much attention to the beginning scene and realize how it really set the stage for the rest of the film (the mise on scene). It really was quite disturbing how the German invasion impacted all of Europe and all of the refugees were forced to Casablanca. This sort of contrasted with the setting of Rick's-brightly lit, music, drinking. etc. The best scene is when Rick lets the young girl's husband win enough at the Roulette table to buy letters to allow them to leave Casablanca-a real tear jerker"

","Casablanca is a prime example of classic Hollywood. With your stars like Bogie and Bergmann, along with great writing, directing, and unforgettable lines, it makes for a movie that none other can compare to. This movie does not need big money effects or action sequences. The acting along will make you fall in love with this classic. It's a story of fate and romance, with a classic ending to die for. I may have been born many many years after, but it's a film that any generation can relate to. If there was ever a list of the top 10 movies never to be considered for a remake, Casablance would be there. Watch this film if you're a fan of the good old days and love a great production and don't forget, ""Here's looking at you, kid""."
"pip_2","10","2","3","10 September 2009"," 'This story doesn't have an ending yet...'
","About 2/3 into Casablanca, Humphrey Bogart's Rick says to Ingrid Bergman's Ilsa that this story doesn't have an ending yet. It is profoundly true, and this could be said of the ending of Casablanca also. Although Rick and Ilsa may well have said their very last goodbyes, the stories of these, and many other characters, in Casablanca are far from over at the 'end' of the film. What happened after Ilsa and Laszlo got on that plane? Did Louis and Rick's beautiful friendship last beyond the runway? And whatever happened to Sam? This is what makes Casablanca a truly unique film; you could make another three or four films about what happens to the characters after Louis and Rick walk off into the mist and it wouldn't get boring. It also gives Casablanca not just a great ending but one of the best in cinema history because it ties up the main story but leaves lots of other stories and questions unanswered before the events of the film as well as after like Rick's shady past in the US before he came to Casablanca.<br/><br/>It shouldn't have worked though and how it did is still a mystery. The script was changed on a daily basis during shooting and many people, including Ingrid Bergman herself, thought the film was second-rate and nothing more. Still, almost seventy years on the film still remains among the favourites of film lovers around the World and at the pinnacle of many people's film collections, mine included. It manages to capture the fear, the suspense and the intensity of the situation in and around Europe at the time and how it reverberated to places like Casablanca and eventually, the World. It encapsulates the power of film that it can take us back to this corrupt, dangerous and unsure World and this again makes Casablanca stand out from the crowd as it does this with such power and conviction. It is no coincidence that it was shot during the war and so this also adds to the air of realism the film has to offer.<br/><br/>Casablanca is one of those rare films that gets better with every watch. The pace of film is very much non-stop from the word go whilst the plot has many twists and turns, so it is almost inevitable that a first time viewer will miss something important or some of the smaller details that the film has to offer. On multiple viewings the film seems to become even darker and more cynical than I had thought before and yet it is still very uplifting in parts. In other words, it's a roller-coaster of a film. It needs to be seen if you have even a passing interest in film. It's one of the essentials and for good reason. Haven't seen it? Get watching!"
"JohnWelles","10","2","3","1 September 2009"," A Classic of Pure Escapism.
","Michael Curtiz's ""Casablanca"" (1942) would be impossible to remake nowadays. Most of the dialogue has passed into the public's conscience, so saying such classic lines like: ""Louis, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship."" would now be impossible to say with a straight face. What a knack the screenwriters, Julius J. Epstein and Philip G. Epstein, had for great dialogue! When seen today, ""Casablanca"" still holds a misty awe about it. Wholly studio bound it may be, but would you rather have the sprawling and ugly city it really is? An improbable classic where the (anti?) hero doesn't get the girl in the end, it is a film only Hollywood could make. A joy to behold."

","This is far and away my favourite movie of all time. I first saw it on some TV Sunday matinée when I was a teenager, and instantly fell in love with Ingrid Bergman.<br/><br/>The movie appears to be filled with clichés, BUT many of those clichés originated from this film. The dialogue is snappy, the characters are wonderfully scripted, and even the minor characters help make this a memorable experience. This was helped at the time by the casting of many refugee artists in minor roles, including the extras in the street scenes.<br/><br/>There is no scene wasted, no unnecessary aspects to the story-telling. The lighting is atmospheric when it needs to be. And the ending ... well, I won't spoil it, but it became an instant classic."

Although I've heard of many actors being up for the part, I can't think of anyone being better suited for the male lead than Humphrey Bogart. Ingrid Bergman is just beautiful. She doesn't need to do much, because her eyes are so expressive.<br/><br/>The supporting cast consists of great actors, including Claude Rains.<br/><br/>Here is a movie that didn't have any elements of action or sex or real violence, or any of the benefits of digital effects, yet it shines masterfully.<br/><br/>It's no wonder that Casablanca has made it on most critic's top ten lists."

"griffolyon12","10","2","3","19 June 2008"," A timeless classic, that is one of the finest films of all-time!
","Casablanca is one of those rare films that truly qualifies as a perfect film. There is absolutely nothing bad about this film, this is a timeless classic that is still as relevant to today's society as it was back in 1942. Many of the themes in Casablanca can still be seen in action in today's world, but what truly makes Casablanca transcend generations is the love story. The love triangle between Rick, Ilsa, and Laszlo is one of the finest triangles in movie history; as much as you want to hate Laszlo so Rick and Ilsa will get together, Laszlo is just such a likable character you can't hate him, and you just know deep down Rick will not take Ilsa away from Laszlo. Of course what truly keeps this film from being a monotonous three-way love story, is the colorful cast of characters surrounding the three leads, in particular the scene stealing Captain Renault played brilliantly by Claude Rains. Of course what has always made me love this film isn't the brilliant characters or the love story, it is in fact the screenplay. The screenplay is one of the finest ever crafted in the history of film, each scene flows perfectly, never feeling too long or too short; as well the film features some of the finest dialogue ever spoken in a movie, there are just so many quotable lines from this movie. Overall Casablanca is just truly a masterpiece, and if you have never seen it I suggest you do because it is one of the greatest films ever made.<br/><br/>I give Casablanca a flawless 10 out of 10!"
"Goodbye_Ruby_Tuesday","10","2","3","1 June 2008"," You Must Remember This
","It's almost unfair to lavish praise on CASABLANCA, for such universal praise comes the expectation of the masterwork of an auteur such as Welles or Hitchcock. The result could not be farther from that expectation, and indeed it is difficult to describe just how and why CASABLANCA remains such a beloved film. Here is a film that nobody wanted to make (especially the stars, who only bonded when trying to get out of the film), that was saddled with production problems from day one due to the incomplete script, and somehow has turned into the most brilliant accidental masterpiece in American cinema.<br/><br/>Humphrey Bogart stars as a cross between a Hemingway anti-hero and Jesus in a waiter's outfit. Richard Blaine, American, age 37 with questionably brown eyes and a sketchy past, runs a popular nightclub in Casablanca during the early days of WWII that attracts a rainbow of diverse characters from Italian thieves to bickering Frenchmen, from desperate refugees to German officers. Rick has all the right things to say (courtesy of the brilliant dialogue via the Epstein Twins, Howard Koch and Casey Robinson) but is deeply flawed, a cynical, selfish man with clearly no respect for himself or other people save the French officer Louis Renault and best friend, the piano-playing Sam. Just as the audience is wondering what made Rick such a complex character, the answer comes in the form of the beautiful Ilsa Lund (the ethereal Ingrid Bergman), who of all the gin joints in all the towns in all the world, walks into Rick's and turns his life upside down. As the woman he once loved and got away for unexplained reasons, it becomes clear that Rick still bears the scars of her leaving him--and that Ilsa still loves him. Now married to Czech resistance fighter Viktor Lazlo (Paul Henried), the couple try in vain to acquire exit visas and, believing that Rick has two letters of transit that would allow anyone to leave Casablanca without question, Ilsa and Viktor try to crack his outer crust, and Rick must choose between his love for Ilsa and his idealistic interior he only thinks he can hide.<br/><br/>When one looks objectively at CASABLANCA, there isn't a lot to rave about, and yet everything comes together so seamlessly. Michael Curtiz's fine knowledge of how the camera told a story was put to excellent use here, from the sweeping shots that pass through imaginary walls to the delicacy of Ingrid Bergman's face. The script, written by at least four different screenwriters while shooting was taking place, should've collapsed under the weight of its own multiple genres and chaotic preparation, but the actors say their lines with a conviction and believability it's difficult to realize that nobody wanted to be there in the first place. <br/><br/>Above all things, it's the characters and performances that make CASABLANCA what it is today. As Roger Ebert pointed out, all the characters are so good, and even the ones that are meant to be ambiguous (such as Renault) or crooks (such as Ugarte), they are so interesting and lively the audience feels compelled to follow them out of Rick's and see where fate takes them. At the center of all this is Rick and Ilsa's tortured love affair. Unlike almost all other love stories, the audience never knows how Rick and Ilsa first met. Unlike almost all other love stories, it doesn't matter; the audience doesn't need a meet-cute scene within the Paris flashback--we see it all in the way Bogart and Bergman look at each other with such love and understanding, and we feel their pain of witnessing their awkward encounter almost two years after Ilsa ran away from Rick. It is a testament to the actors yet again that makes a rather conventional love story so interesting and involving. The role of an anti-hero is one Humphrey Bogart could've sleepwalked through, but under Michael Curtiz's direction there's an understanding just beneath the surface that breaks through. And Ingrid Bergman more or less disowned the film that cemented her in film history (and objectively speaking Ilsa is a very underwritten character), but she was above all things a professional; she did her job and she did it so well she was never able to escape the praise that followed her to her death. Her most celebrated scene is perhaps when Curtiz lets the camera linger on her gorgeous face while Sam plays ""it,"" and memories of love and pain come rushing back. Any other actress would've overplayed it, but Bergman is almost doing what another famous Swedish import had done 9 years earlier, when Greta Garbo made a blank face and let the audience interpret the final close-up of QUEEN Christina, even though the audience *does* know what Ilsa's thinking, and it's all the more poignant for Bergman's performance.<br/><br/>How CASABLANCA has survived for over 60 years is a miracle, and it'll continue to inspire for another 60 years, because it's still the same old story: a fight for love and glory, a case of do or die. All great literature and films are still relevant because of their universal themes; in this case, the world will always welcome a great love story, terrific acting and classic storytelling as time goes by."

","Casablanca <br/><br/>Every time I watch this film every other film makes so much more sense. Over the years Casablanca has been referenced in more films then I can count, everything from the Muppets and film to the Simpson's and television. <br/><br/>I thought it was interesting that the entire film was shot in studio except the one scene at the start when Major Strasser arrives. This probably has something to do with the director Michael Curtiz who filmed primarily in the studio throughout his carrier, as well this was the common way movies were made in the early times of film. Michael Curtiz, a renowned Hungarian filmmaker, began his carrier in Hungary and Austria making silent films He later immigrated to America in 1926 and began a lavish carrier in Hollywood were he directed over 100 films including; Captain Blood (1935), The Charge of the Light Brigade (1936), The Adventures of Robin Hood (1938), The Sea Wolf (1941), Mildred Pierce (1945), White Christmas (1954), and The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (1960) to list a few. He has directed ever genre imaginable and is consistently one of the greatest directors of the 20th century. <br/><br/>The story Casablanca originated from the play ""everybody comes to Rick's"" by Murray Burnett & Joan Alison. It was later revised by Julius J. Epstein & Philip G. Epstein, who added more elements of comedy to the story. Later Howard Koch began writing for the film in conjunction with the Epstein twins, Koch highlighted the political and melodramatic elements of the story. As well the unaccredited Casey Robinson added some important scenes. I felt that because so many people worked and contributed to the script it formed a balance of genres it mixed comedy, romance, drama, and politics. Each writer wanted to do something different with the script and when they all collaborated together we sort of got the best of what everyone had to offer. <br/><br/>The director of photography on Casablanca was Arthur Edeson, who is well known as one of the founders of the American Society of Cinematographers. He is known for his work in film such as The Maltese Falcon (1941), Sergeant York (1941), and Frankenstein. Edeson is considered a pioneer of film and was one of the first to film a major wide-screen feature, The Big Trail (1930). Edeson enjoyed experimenting with light and different techniques. The dark film noir and expressionist lighting is evident in several scenes throughout Casablanca, particularly towards the end. When I watch the film the way the whole thing is lit and shot is fantastic the precision to details especially, for example in some shots throughout the film bars of shadows fall across the background and characters faces. This likely indicates their imprisonment, and emotional turmoil. It's details like this that makes Edeson one of the greatest DoP's in the 20th century, and makes Casablanca a masterpiece. <br/><br/>One of my favorite parts of the film is were the Germans start singing ""Die Wacht Am Rhein"" and the French begin the sing Marseillaise I felt that was the most powerful scene in the film. I thought it was amazing because it combined music and visuals perfectly, as well the French Marseillaise was played by an entire orchestra not just a small band like in Rich's café the powerful music combined with the great camera work really captures and emphasizes the first time the Germans get defeated by Laszlo possibly foreshadowing the end of the film. Music is always an important part in film you can take a great film but with the wrong music it just doesn't work I felt the score in Casablanca, by max Steiner, fit perfectly. <br/><br/>The casting for this film was excellent I could not imagine anyone else as the main roles in this film. Humphrey Bogart is perfect for this role; the chemistry between him and the lead actress Ingrid Bergman makes this story come to life. I find that dramas are always tricky to do you can have all the best filmmakers in the world but without good actors you can't have a good drama. Casablanca combined good actors with superb filmmakers to create an everlasting classic. <br/><br/>Casablanca is a part of film-making and that's the truth you can hate the movie or love it, but it will always be one of the greatest films of the 20th century. I would recommend this film to every filmmaker because even if you don't like the story, the film itself is such an important part of film history that it is a necessity to watch. I think this is a great film more for the technical aspects of the film then the actual story, which I find a little dry and uninteresting. Overall I enjoy this film every time I watch it, and I am sure I will watch it again."

I know that countless words have been written about this movie, so anything I say will probably be nothing new, but I'll say it anyway. This movie could have easily become some kind of corny and phony contrivance about some ex-patriot loser who is wallowing in self-pity because some woman led him on and then gave him the old ""heave-ho."" This movie could have easily become little more than just another World War Two movie, with the good guys vs the bad guys, with the latter getting everything they deserve. But this movie goes way beyond that, and is a work of art. Now this may sound like a cliché, but it isn't. This movie actually conveys a story that is both complex and compelling and contains some really great acting which transforms the script into something that the audience can actually listen to and follow without trying to figure out what's going on. Many of the characters in this movie are intrinsically unattractive and unlikable, but when mixed together, they emerge as some of the most memorable characters in the history of American cinema. I won't rehash this movie because anyone who knows cinema has undoubtedly already seen it. But suffice it to say, this movie is one-of-a-kind and should be treated as such."

I had returned home from seeing a movie which was so poor that I have no recollection as to what film it was. I got home just as Casablanca was starting, and -- in spite of, or maybe beCAUSE of having already seen a movie that day -- sat mesmerized through the entire film. When it was over I looked at my wife and said ""Do you think the guy who made that piece of crap we saw earlier has ever even SEEN a good movie?"" I suspect that some young film makers have not. Casablanca has, besides one of the great casts in film history: sharp, smartly paced dialogue; layers of true- to-life stories; superb black-and-white photography.

They are both stories of people falling in love - who shouldn't fall in love, and as with all great films you have to wait until the final scenes to find out who gets the girl.

We felt we could beat any invader that had the nerve to cross the east river and come into our neighborhood. thats the way we felt about our country at that time, I am 65 years old and I must have seen casablanca at least 20 to 30 times and I still get that same feeling I got back then. I consider this movie a national treasure and a work of art that could only have been made in the good old U.S of A. it will live on forever."

","Bogart is not exactly what one would call a handsome leading male. Bergman certainly is a beautiful leading actress. The softness of black and white film makes one feel as if you are in a dream but at the time the film was made, the reality of a world at war made the film even more poignant. The theme is just as important today as it was then and perhaps this is the reason it is a timeless classic. The classic good vs. evil The film makes a wonderful point of showing heroes are ordinary people called upon to do extraordinary things. The true beauty in this film is you just end up feeling good after it's all over. I never tire of watching it."
"ACitizenCalledKane","10","2","3","22 December 2004"," One of the greatest motion pictures of all time!
","When Michael Curtiz' film, Casablanca, left Warner Bros. studio and hit the silver screen in 1942, it was intended to be a well-received box-office success. It had a star-studded cast, a fine director, and very talented writers. What more does a film need to be successful? Needless to say, Casablanca more than surpassed all expectations. It won three Academy Awards (Best Director, Picture, and Screenplay) in 1943. That, in of itself, is impressive for a movie that was produced in much the same way as about fifty-one other pictures that were produced by Warner Bros. that year. Granted, this movie did have a lot going for it, but there was some confusion during the making of it, like, trying to decide on an ending, for example. The ending was a last-minute thought by the writers, and so Ingrid Bergman was likely just as surprised to hear it as her on-screen persona, Ilsa. The ending, like the entire film, has, of course gone down in movie history as being one of the more memorable endings of all time. In retrospect, all of the honors and success that Casablanca received was nothing in comparison to the impact that it has had ever since it came out.<br/><br/>As for the movie itself, what can be said about Casablanca that hasn't already been said? It is an extraordinary film. It is entertaining and powerful. It won't dazzle you with ""avant-garde cinematic expression"" or Freudian references. It is simply a well-crafted movie. Plain and simple. Michael Curtiz oversaw the making of one of the highlights of American cinema. The writing was exceptional, with humor sprinkled in between drama, romance, action, suspense, etc. The performances in Casablanca, though, are a joy to behold. Humphrey Bogart's bitter, vulnerable Rick is easily one of his greatest achievements, while Ingrid Bergman was more beautiful than ever as Ilsa, Rick's love interest. Paul Henreid supplies Ilsa's husband, Victor, with a dignity that makes him as honorable as any screen hero I've ever seen. Claude Rains gives a typically wonderful performance as the corrupt Captain Renault, who respects Rick, but must answer to Major Strasser (played by Conrad Veidt at his most sinister), a Nazi sent to Casablanca to find Victor. Sydney Greenstreet and Peter Lorre contribute small, but equally important and memorable characters, as Ferrari and Ugarte, respectively. Last, but certainly not least, is Dooley Wilson, who brought a warm sincerity to this movie that was just as powerful as any other emotion on display during the film.<br/><br/>It just doesn't get much better than this. I have recommended this film to everyone I have met who has missed out on this wonderful film. It has it all, and if you have not seen Casablanca, do yourself a favor, and see it now!"

","Just a few days ago, a friend ( same age range ) asked me what the best ever, greatest movie ever made was and with barely a thought, I said ""Casablanca"". <br/><br/>I really can't explain why but, to me, ""Casablanca"" is the best.<br/><br/>Casting, direction, lighting. <br/><br/>Bogart as Rick, Ingrid as Ilsa, that pairing was perfect. Rains as the Captain, Sydney Greenstreet was perfect as Ferrari and who of the time would have been better than Henreid as Victor Laszlo.

"mnjanco","10","2","3","6 December 2004"," The Best Movie Ever Made
","It's hard not to repeat others when commenting on the movie that many people consider to be the best of all times. The Film Institute ranks it number two behind Citizen Kane. I like Citizen Kane very much, but I do not think it is anywhere near as good as Casablanca. It is simply the finest blend of script, sets, characters, casting, music and photography that Hollywood has ever produced. Who can forget the shadow of the dancing woman on the wall? Has there ever been a funnier straight man than Claude Raines? Or an oilier villain than Peter Lorre? The scene where Paul Heinried leads the audience in the Marseillaise is rightfully one of the most touching in the history of the cinema. But what impressed me is how the French National Anthem blended with the German song the Nazis were singing, so well that it sounded like a round. As much as I liked the movie itself, I never appreciated it as much until I bought the VHS version showing the making of the movie. How many viewers realize that the writers didn't know which of the lead characters Ilse would go off with until literally the end of the movie? How many know that three different directors worked on various parts of the movie? Or that it was one of the most brilliant success stories of a movie put together by committee? Not too many years ago, the favorite trivia ""factoid"" was that Bogart never said ""Play it again, Sam."" He actually said, ""Play it, Sam."" I still get misty-eyed every time I hear As Time Goes By. It's very unusual that I remember the theme from a modern movie by the time I leave the theatre. Only the Ring Trilogy has come close to matching Casablanca in so many different ways. But who wants to watch something for ten hours when you can get the same effect in an hour and a half?"
"dougandwin","10","2","3","22 July 2004"," Two letters of Transit = Complete Entertainment
","This film has to be the most talked about movie ever, and yet when you look at it, there are so many holes in the story, but who really cares, when the entertainment contained in 100 minutes is so great.  I must admit that I still do not know after 60 years how "" two letters of transit"" enabled anyone to escape as did Ingrid Bergman and Paul Henreid, but again, why bother about such a minor detail.  The aforementioned stars, along with Humphrey Bogart entered into the mood from the start, and brought us one of the best movies ever.  The supporting cast, particularly Claude Rains, Sydney Greenstreet and Conrad Veidt were spot on, and added so much to it. Michael Curtiz did a wonderful job as director, while the black and white photography added so much to it.   I still shudder when I think how Jack Warner was considering Ronald Reagan and Ann Sheridan for the main roles."
"KubricksRube","10","2","3","1 July 2004"," One of Hollywood's best, Bogart's second-best performance (SPOILERS)
","This is a great movie, and one of the best examples of the Golden Age.  The movie works not only because of a great script, great cast, and great minimalist direction, but because it provides an excellent sense of time and place.  Few movies are so directly linked to the time in which they were made.  In 1942 the outcome of the war was a question mark, as was the Nazi threat.  This movie was made when nobody was sure who would win, and it shows.  The desperation of the characters, from Rick himself to bit parts that receive only five seconds of screen time, comes across perfectly without being over-stated or glossed over to give the love triangle more screen time.  In fact, forget the love triangle, the real struggle in this movie is in Rick (though as this movie's script is so heavily analyzed by every film school in the country, I'm probably not saying anything new).<br/><br/>Few major Hollywood productions have such human characters.  Nobody in this movie is an archetype, they are all flawed, they make mistakes, and most importantly they will all redeem themselves in some way (except for the Nazis, who would certainly not be shown redeeming themselves in a war-time movie).  Sydney Greenstreet is a criminal, and proud of it, yet he decides to give Ilsa and Victor some helpful information, admitting that he doesn't see how it helps him.  Claude Rains is a despicable pig who uses his authority to get sexual favors from desperate women, and he too is proud of this, yet at the end he also redeems himself.<br/><br/>Some people have said that this movie has the best supporting cast in history, and they may be right.  The Bulgarian girl, Rick's staff, Peter Lorre, Victor Laszlo, Claude Rains, Sydney Greenstreet, Sam, and the Nazi who looks like Porky Pig with a monocle.  I said in the header that this is Bogart's second-best performance, and the first would be Treasure of the Sierra Madre (you saw that coming, I'm sure).<br/><br/>Unfortunately a lot of the dramatic impact of this movie, especially the finale, will be ruined for many younger viewers like myself, because it is so endlessly quoted and imitated in other movies, books, tv shows, etc. This is a darn shame.  Nevertheless, I gave this movie a 10/10."

","The best movie of all time.  Romance, intrigue, mystery, and classic movie lines that have lasted over 60 years.  Thankfully kept in black and white ""Casablanca"" has all the right pieces in all the right places.  Absolutely my #1 movie on my list and believe me I have a short, short list.  Most of the modern movies are junk comparable to the fast-food lifestyle we in the U. S. have created.  Casablanca is not only a classic but has set the bar for movie-making so high that only a few movies can begin to approach it's level.  I play this game with my grown children; I ask them in 60 years what actors/actresses of today will be remembered and spoken of in high regard. NOT MANY MY FRIENDS! Who do you think will be the new classic actors of tomorrow?"
"JoeysGirl4Ever","Null","2","3","28 May 2004"," cool baby cool
","Casablanca, does it reflect society or does society reflect this little hole in the wall resort? When watching the movie, one can't help but notice all the lines that just seem so cliché and yet fit so well into the story; is it because the coolest cat of them all (Humphrey Bogart) is delivering them? Is it because this movie is completely satirical in nature so it just adds humor to the plot? Or is it because the clichés we hear everyday have come from this movie all 10 + of them. <br/><br/>Maybe not so much reason number 2 but definitely reason 3 and perhaps a little of number 1. Humphrey Bogart is THE definition of 'cool'; literally, look it up in the dictionary and his picture will be there. So when this swanky, hip guy says 'Here's lookin' at you kid' for the umpteenth time, it's acceptable because it's Bogey, and what Bogey does is cool, never overdone. <br/><br/>This movie is set during WWII and is about a leader from the underground movement (Victor Laszlo played by Paul Henreid), his wife (Ilsa Lund Laszlo played by Ingrid Bergman) and the owner of a little café, (Rick Blaine played by Humphrey Bogart). It is about when they have a chance meeting in Morocco, some for a first introduction and others for a surprise reunion. Of course, there is a lovely flashback set to the lovers' song and the story of what happened years ago and how things have ended up the way they are becomes clear. As a 15 year-old freshmen this movie wasn't enjoyable, but 3 years later this movie is absolutely adorable and very much recommended as a 'must-see'. Berlin and Bogart has such chemistry and the story has such an interesting twist, it's hard to accept but at the same time that's how things must be. It leaves you with a sense of completion but at the same time uneasy because there are other possibilities that will never be fulfilled. 3 weeks later, the lost dreams are still irritating to this reviewer. <br/><br/>American society is defiantly portrayed in this film, Humphrey plays a café owner that, 9 times out of 10, is doing something for his own benefit, but then he does something to help someone else and it just seems to completely mask the 'bad' things he may have done. For example, there is gambling going on in Rick's Café; there is a roulette wheel, in fact, a fixed one. This wheel is fixed so that Rick is getting more returns back and it isn't a fair game of chance. But then a woman in a desperate situation with a genuine need for money to save herself, her husband, and their marriage comes along and Rick gets soft. He then discreetly tells the woman's husband the winning slot number and color so that he can win money and they can get on to a better place. Rick saved that woman from a huge burden and it completely makes up for his owning a fixed wheel. <br/><br/>This is much in the same way reflective of American society. As a country we are constantly doing what we need to get ahead in life, even if for some people it requires cheating or lying; much the same way we have tremendous powers over other countries we didn't get it just by sweet-talking. But other people will come along once in a while and hit a soft spot in your heart and there is an urge to do the right thing and help them out, much like a country will be in need and we'll help them out, hopefully in the best way possible. <br/><br/>This movie is really a great one; it has love, danger, and politics, an interesting mixture of topics to keep every person interested in some way. Rated highly among movies it definitely has earned a top spot on this reviewers list. And if anything, it reminds us to help other around us make the best possible decisions for their lives, we need to follow Rick's example a little more often even if he does do a lot of dirty business he truly does care for those around him if they are good people."

","I saw this film for the first time when I was 17 years old and I rented it because I felt it was something I should have seen already.  I liked it and was surprised by how much of the film I had already seen in various forms of homage and mimicry (probably more lines have been immortalized in Casablanca than any other film).  But that was about it.  I saw it again when I was 19 years old and this time it blew me away.  The performances, the writing, the cinematography, the direction, and the music all seemed perfect.  I watched one more time a little later to confirm that this might be one of the best films ever, and I liked it even more.  I can't necessarily give specifics, but maybe it's the chemistry between Bogart and Bergman, or maybe it's the outstanding supporting cast.

What kind of magic was worked during this film can only be guessed at. Some unique synergy took place on that Hollywood lot that has never happened since. An ensemble cast that could never be reassembled; craft masters and artisans at the peak of their skill; a world situation of uncertainty and worry, infecting the set with its tension and clarities. Somehow it all gelled; Rick, the world weary warrior; Ilsa, the luminous and virtuous beauty; a cracking script, awesome cinematography, laser edge editing and direction, and That Song.<br/><br/>How do you define the greatest film ever made? The ability to watch it again and again without ever becoming sated? The continued discovery of new things to enjoy? The comfort of knowing that what you are about to see is just as good as it gets? The fact that the gulf between films like this and most of the dross turned out today just gets wider? The perfect mise en scene? I don't know.

"Lejink","9","1","1","2 January 2020"," Play it again and again
","Like all great art, ""Casablanca"" is a film that stands repeat viewings time after time, until you get to the point where you're saying whole lines of dialogue in lip-synch with the actors. I've just watched it again for the umpteenth time and still get caught up in the foreign intrigue, instinctive direction and superb playing of all the leads.<br/><br/>The film's screenplay has won awards as the best ever, which is of course ironic considering it was going through rewrites right up until shooting and the actors themselves didn't always understand the convoluted plotting. Perhaps their uncertainty helps give the film its edge, no-one quite knows how it's all going to finish until the pieces fall perfectly into place in the closing ten minutes at the airfield.<br/><br/>With more classic lines than any other film I can think of, including the most misquoted one ever, every plot and sub-plot is deftly handled and resolved. Moreover, it was undoubtedly brave of Warner's to take a patriotic stand at a time when the war was going badly for the Allies and one can only imagine the boost to morale the famous scene, when the patrons of Rick's Place drown out the provocative would-be triumphal and mocking singing of the German soldiers with their heartfelt rendition of the Marseillaise, gave to watching filmgoers in free Europe, especially France.<br/><br/>At its heart of course is a love story, a beautiful, twisted, dangerous and ultimately doomed love story, but it never upsets the balance of the film which helps it to ultimately satisfy on so many levels.<br/><br/>The acting, of course, is beyond reproach, Bogart as the cynical bar-owner with a conscience, Bergman, luminously beautiful but subtle and sensitive as she guards her heart, Rains, brilliant as the weather-vane local cop playing every angle and Heinreid as the noble, brave partisan who's also enough of a man of the world to forgive his wife's accidental transgression. Plus of course, even in the minor roles, some little more than cameos by Sydney Greenstreet, Peter Lorre, Dooley Wilson and others, there are eye-catching and memorable performances.<br/><br/>And let's not forget the astute direction of Michael Curtiz, often regarded and indeed derided by some critics as a journeyman, contractual director, known as a reliable and efficient studio-man who got the job done in an unflashy way. Be that as it may, I know he's directed many Hollywood features which are favourites of mine and if ever a movie needed an unflashy treatment, it was this one.<br/><br/>Curtiz knew that when it comes to great story-telling in celluloid, the fundamental things apply and that's why ""Casablanca"" will be loved and revered, as time goes by."

Just have a vague idea what it is REALLY about... but so what. Is it romance or a war movie? Dunno. I'm going to watch it now. Let's dive.""
And that was the best decision on how to approach that movie - without expectations. Yes, it is a super hyped classical Hollywood block buster. Yes, it is a great love story, so great, it sounds so unreal when you read about it. It is replayed over and over in TV at peak times (like Christmas?). Yes, it is over 60 years old, black and white and uses different cinematic styles than modern cinema.<br/><br/>What compelled me in this movie is how truly timeless it is. The usage of lenses, blurry fuzzy filters (to make it look more glorious and romantic at times, esp. Bergmanns face), the play of light and shadow, camera movement bring out the pure emotions of the actors so, so well... I wouldn't have expected that!<br/><br/>Timeless is, when the characters and the story feels real and 'possible' no matter the age or the black-white-colors or the different era. The dialogue is thoughtful, deep (and deserves a rewatch to truly appreciate it!) and the characters have these subtle, gentle movements and expressions that are salt and pepper to the story. The true intensity is written in their faces, like they were sitting across from us at a dinner table at candle light, re-telling their deepest, heart-felt memories.<br/><br/>I was IN love with Richard (Bogart) when the camera zooms in on Ilsa (Bergmann) with the warm, fuzzy light and her glowing eyes - and I fell for Richard when he expressed his sometimes truly life-affirming, sometimes cynical ideas. It is melancholic, sentimental and yet full of life.<br/><br/>Sure, it isn't a movie of 'our time', but it shows human nature and life, that is lived for centuries, no matter if it is in the 40s or today. It was a great journey into the past and ends with the present.<br/><br/>I truly appreciate this movie, even if it is not my favorite movie of all times. That's ok. It is timeless - and THAT is the true mastery here for me."

It's hard for me to believe he died almost 50 years ago. Every time I watch his films, it's like they were made yesterday. And that's why he is timeless.

","Casablanca is this type of movies that do not make anybody indifferent, of those that were remaining in your recollection forever. A precious history in times of war. A former romance that it remains in the hearts of those who cannot forget. The one who has not loved ever and to the time it could not have continued with the promises that once he said? Since this way it is Casablanca, which happened was the better of our life, but the time happens and everything ends.
"" Always we will still have Paris "" says to him Rick (H. Bogart) to Ilsa (Ingrid Bergman) this when it is going to divide towards America. A Paris that stays as this recollection that they have not forgotten throughout the years, a Paris that retains the love that was had and that there remained. Difficult what is ... truth? During the existence of the human this being it limits itself to promising things that in occasions it cannot fulfill, falls in love, looks for a reason by which to remain entertained until the sad end, that end that comes to all without differentiating any alive being of this planet, the death. "" Since the time happens "" he says the song that there touches Sam (D. Wilson) for Ilsa, it forms a of seeing that the facts of the present will transform in recollections of the future and when the death finally comes, it will be the recollection of us themselves what it will remain.
The presence on screen of H. Bogart is indisputable, becomes big in chamber and his action performs the better thing that transmits great classic this one, there is no way of resisting turn fascinated by his interpretation. His place is cozy and important in the plot. In fact, in this place it is where a scene takes place praises of great meaning. The German officials sing a military march and other clients of the bar remain quiet, listening until Lazslo (P. Henreid) sees what happens. It is admirable as Víctor, in this moment of supremacy Nazi, decides to intone the Of Marseilles one and the whole bar joins him, silencing to the German voices. An anthem for the freedom, the equality and the brotherhood.
Definitively, Casablanca is of the best movies that there offers us the wide range of the classic cinema and, since I have mentioned previously, it will remain always strictly between ourselves, will remain as what is, a nice recollection."

I wonder if some might interpret the love between them back in Paris is just all fleeting; a way to overcome (or rather forget) another heartbreak. A cruel cycle no doubt.<br/><br/>The actions by the characters in Casablanca seem flawed because they themselves are flawed. But we must also remember that it also makes sense from a narrative perspective given how Rick used to be a freedom fighter. And yet, what stirred my heart and I'm sure for a lot of people is that despite the logic, our emotions can't help but disagree, just like Llsa later on. So it's essential a role reversal in how the characters feel by the end of the movie.<br/><br/>From what I said in the first paragraph, La La Land owes a great deal to Casablanca."
"guedesnino","9","1","1","17 June 2017"," Casablanca is a utopian world, a great metaphor about life that is at once the limbo linking hell to paradise.
","In ""Adaptation"" by Spike Jonze, ""Casablanca"" is referred to as a masterpiece for those who want to study and create a screenplay, the consideration is made by screenwriter Robert McKee (Brian Cox), and without a doubt: it is.<br/><br/>The 1942 classic directed by Michael Curtiz, goes through the centuries as the reference of the seventh art, mainly for the development of its history, an exquisite script that follows the classic linear structure (beginning, middle and end), and who knows how to take advantage of it To provoke small breaks in linearity, in developing a dramatic history whose past we do not know but which is a fundamental part that interferes with the decisions and characteristics of a character, and an uncertain future, but with clear possibilities. We know the paths available to the protagonists, but which will be the chosen and the reason, this only know at the end of the film. The script is based on the play ""Everybody Comes To Rick's,"" being developed in three hands, by Julius J. Epstein, Philip G. Epstein and Howard Koc. A curiosity is that the text of the piece only got to be mounted (years) later, and the rights to the cinema was one of the highest values ​​paid at the time.<br/><br/>""Casablanca"" begins with an ironic narration, close to the comedies that parody wars, and at different moments we have this jocular air in the dialogues of the personages, such as Richard Blane (Humphrey Bogart ) That satirizes its condition of abandoned man or of the transitory condition and of waiting of the great room of connections that is the ""airport Casablanca"". However, the script makes the slide precisely by wanting to present the external world through flash black, a feature that does not add anything interesting to the film, but is an easy way out to try to clarify important facts of the past, yet something that a script So bright and a precise direction, could have solved with other means.<br/><br/>A thriving feature used to compose the illumination of the film is the idea of ​​a lantern of a lighthouse, which reflects its turn throughout that city, although spatially speaking, the light of this lighthouse reveals that Casablanca is as short as the extension between two open arms , But it is clear the proposal of director Michael Curtiz that with the direction of photography of Arthur Edeson, create an atmosphere of occultism, and that as the characters, we only have vestiges of shadows, they are not clear, as the lapses of illumination , Which little by little reveals something. Another point that contributes to the illumination and photography adopted is the total superficiality employed. We are in a city in Morocco, where sunlight is strong and abundant, but as ""Casablanca"" was shot in the studio, and also proposes the features of a Superficial city, its illumination is composed of lamps, chandeliers, lamps, glares and lighthouses and rarely we have reflections of the sun. This artificiality is also felt in the direction of art performed by Carl Jules Weyl, who in what would be internal and external scenarios, works with very definite oppositions, in the internal environments we have the richness of details, as in the bar ""Ricks Café American"" or "" Club Owner Signor Ferrari ""in these environments everything is very luxurious and grandiose and well explored in open plans or the close detail minutiae revealing a beautiful work of composition of images and Mise en scène.<br/><br/>The soundtrack is marked by the classic ""Like the Time Goes By"" and La Marseillaise, the national anthem of France. Both gain ""status"" in addition to soundtrack, become ""leitmotiv"", and generating some uneasiness, in the third strand of La Marseillaise more than to know that the French are there or that it is a quest to praise France, we know that It is an insecurity on the part of the director to clarify points that are already established as local skin frequented or by the uniforms used by the characters (eg differentiate German soldiers from the French). But the apex of exaltation of the national anthem of France occurs when it is used to provoke the Germans, capable even of uniting the French who are in the Rick café and under German rule.<br/><br/>Humphrey Bogart as Richard Blane, Ingrid Bergman as Ilsa Lund Laszlo and Paul Henreid as Victor Laszlo, stand out individually, and the alien origin of each actor favors the clandestine and migratory game inherent in the film. If separately each actor stands out, the combination in a love triangle works even more, and greatly divides the viewer to the lovable favoritism of Ilsa's character, for both the charming Blane and the heroic Victor are charismatic and with divergent qualities, but Together only complicate yet another position that helps in determining who Ilsa should stay with. None of these characters fall on a Manichean scale to the bad side. Some are cynical, some lie, some kill"

","I just watched Casablanca last night, and it's one of the greatest films I have ever seen in my life. Everything about it is great. For one, it is one of the most gripping love stories ever to hit the screens, and its romantic drama has rarely been matched since it was made. Same goes for the acting, which is some of the finest in film history. All of this and more will put together one of the greatest movies you will ever see. Period.<br/><br/>Rick Blaine (Humphrey Bogart) is an ex-freedom fighter who now runs a nightclub in Casablanca, a place filled entirely with French refugees seeking unauthorized transit passes so they can escape to America. Victor Laszlo (Paul Henreid), who is at the top of the Nazi most wanted list, comes to Casablanca with his wife Ilsa (Ingrid Bergman), a former lover of Blaine who departed him when the Nazis overtook Paris. She wants her husband to escape, but her love for Rick re-ignites, and she wants to stay in Casablanca. However, things become more dangerous for the Laszlos, and despite their revived love for each other, Rick convinces Ilsa that she must leave with her husband. He then sees her off on a plane on a fog-enshrouded runway in one of the greatest movie conclusions of all time.<br/><br/>
There are so many moments, many of which will forever be unforgotten, in Casablanca that stand out even when compared to greater or bigger films. Every scene is gripping, like when Rick has a flashback to his romantic times with Ilsa in Paris while piano player Sam (Dooley Wilson) plays ""As Time Goes By"", or when Rick walks out onto the runway and tells Capt. Renault (Claude Rains), ""Louis, I think this could be the start of a beautiful friendship"". But these invincible moments obviously don't need retelling, for almost everyone knows of them. As for the timeless cast, Humphrey Bogart is simply stunning as the leading man. The class, drama, and brilliance in his performance are impossible to match, although there have been countless attempts to try to surpass it. Ingrid Bergman is simply gorgeous, and contributes a performance that's worth cheering for. In fact, all of the performances in this movie will have you cheering.<br/><br/>
This is the kind of film that many other Hollywood movies have followed the footsteps of, yet probably very few have rivaled or suprassed. In a nutshell, Casablanca is a sweeping classic that will leave you breathless. From Humphrey Bogart's classy acting to the great ending, there is not a flaw to speak of. In the battle of the ultimate classics, it's not as good as Citizen Kane (despite a higher star rating, but star ratings don't speak all of the volumes in my book). But it's still a fantastic movie. Watch it and enjoy it. <br/><br/>`Here's looking at you kid!'<br/><br/>***** out of *****"
"tributarystu","9","1","1","11 January 2003"," Splendid
","I thought I had seen a very rare few of the great movies that have been made. I now trust, I was right. <br/><br/>SPOILERS<br/><br/>Casablanca, a place of transit. People come, people go, like a river that doesn't stop to flow. The circumstances make Casablanca a very important place: France already invaded by the nazi troops, America seems the only way to freedom. Humans reign that city, and humans always have two sides: a sentimental side and a raw picture of themselves. <br/><br/>Casablanca is a love story and it is a drama. It is not one of those love stories we get to see nowadays...it is something special, where actually love does not really prevail. It shows that the individual sometimes has to sacrifice himself in order for humanity to win. Some people are capable of such a sacrifice, others are not.<br/><br/>Rick and Victor are quite the same kind of people, or at least would've been if they had met sooner. Rick changed after Ilsa left him, and he lost his will to fight...probably because there wasn't anyone to support him, because Ilsa wasn't with him. So, when he took the decision at the end he knew why he did that, and he sacrificed himself. He adapted himself to the life in Casablanca, and was doing well there...until Ilsa came along with her husband...<br/><br/>Ilsa was for him Paris, not Casablanca. His time with Ilsa was in Paris. As she left him, he was destroyed, but found the power to keep going. Since then he didn't seem a very friendly character, but he was a good hearted one. His ""donation"" for the young couple was an act of greatness, and through that he avoided any ""less pleasent things"" for the young lady.<br/><br/>
Victor is fighting for freedom, has suffered a lot, but knows to keep his nerve. He has a great will, and psychical strength, and his role is of a pretty great importance. There wasn't only the war all could see, there was also the war of the already conquered countries. This was a more difficult one, and for the ones who dared to take part in it, it usually meant death.<br/><br/>
The ""poor"" corrupted captain Renault, is a nice character. He is funny, and he is the kind of guy who is on the side of those who have the power. Actually, that is quite cowardly, but he does his job pretty well. He's also got a sense of rightness, but until the end, his job is more important than that. He shows finally that he is a sentimentalist, and that he does know what is right. His decision at the end isn't quite glorious, as he at first warns Strasser, but then, as there weren't any risks involved, he decides to keep to Rick.<br/><br/>The actors are just great, and the whole atmosphere of the movie is unique. You will feel your heart beat, you might fall in love with the characters, and you will feel the tense situations. This movie is definitely one of the best I have ever seen, if not the actual best. In a world that hasn't changed much, where money still makes the laws, love is the thing that can make you survive, and win your battles. This movie is touching...this movie is the only real romance movie I have seen, and It showed to me that I was partly wrong asking myself why only older movies are in some movie standings."

I THOUGHT I knew the lines, I did, I THOUGHT I knew the music, and I did, but only when I see this movie over and over do I begin to appreciate Bergman's acting, Bogie's finesse, and Steiner's music. Ever since I saw ""Carrotblanca,"" I remembered that I should really try to see this one. So at the first opportunity, I bought it, watched it that very night, and unlike Doctor Zhivago, this one actually kept me entertained and sympathized with the characters. It's an amazing story, I'm surprised people have actually thought this was a boring film... though for action-loving dudes on motorcycles in leather and gold chains might find it so.<br/><br/>NO ONE PLAYS IT LIKE SAM!

After watching it last night I remembered what made me a movie fan in the first place.  Movies like Casablanca.  I was astounded with how influential this picture was.  I knew Raiders of the Lost Ark was inspired by the old Saturday Afternoon Serials, but I had NO IDEA how much it had taken from ""Casablanca.""  The shots, the cinematography, the staging of characters, even the clothing.  So many movies were inspired by this film (some were direct rip-offs).  I may go as far as to say that this is the most influential film ever made (along with Citizen Kane)!  I absolutely loved it.  No matter what type of film you favor, you'll find something to like about this movie.  Don't make the same mistake I did and put it off for decades.  It's well worth a rental or even a purchase!"
"gaityr","9","1","1","15 August 2002"," A film for everyone, even 'As Time Goes By'...
","How does one even begin to describe CASABLANCA? I know that there's nothing I can say to improve its reputation, or to make it any more well-loved. All I can attest to is the fact that I had the chance to see this film for the first time today, and just couldn't help falling in love with it. It's as close to perfect as a romance film could get, with elements of war, action, suspense, and good old-fashioned friendship thrown in to spice things up a little.<br/><br/>(Summary contains spoilers, beware!) <br/><br/>It's war-time, and Casablanca is en route to America and freedom. Rick Blaine (Humphrey Bogart), cynical and crusty owner of Cafe Americain, hides a softer, wounded side beneath his tough exterior. He says many times that he's never going to stick his neck out for anyone, that it's a policy of his not to drink with people in his cafe--all things that change when Isla (Ingrid Bergman) comes back into his life, unfortunately accompanied by her husband Victor Laszlo (Paul Henreid). Victor is a top man in the resistance movement, and needs desperately to escape to America to continue his fight for freedom. CASABLANCA isn't all about politics, however. It really comes down to the love of Rick for Ilsa, whom he met for a heady love affair in Paris, all set to the tune of 'As Time Goes By' (surely one of the most beautiful and memorable love songs ever written). His choice is the most difficult one anyone could ever be expected to make, and what's good about the film is that it keeps the audience guessing, even to the end, about just what Rick will do with the power he has over the fate of Ilsa, and most importantly, Victor (and as the film would have us believe, the free world!). I dare your heart not to break when Rick tells Ilsa, as he so famously does, ""Ilsa, I'm no good at being noble, but it doesn't take much to see that the problems of three little people don't amount to a hill of beans in this crazy world."" And then one realises just what war can do to people, and what people can do in spite of war.<br/><br/>It's a fantastic film to be discovering for the first time, since the directing, acting and script are all first-rate. Michael Curtiz pulls the entire film together beautifully, drawing an incredible performance from Humphrey Bogart (perhaps the only actor--aside from Spencer Tracy--who could come off as so apparently self-centred and cynical and yet reveal a believably vulnerable side) and capturing Ingrid Bergman in all her luminous beauty. The supporting cast is brilliant, especially Claude Rains as the parallel character to Bogart's Rick, Captain Louis Renault. He certainly rivals Bergman for screen-time, and justifiably gets the lion's share of the good lines. Moreover, the screenplay is one of the most oft-quoted ones ever written, and for good reason: you just don't get dialogue like this anymore, in any film, and it's a treat to be allowed to listen in on the lives of these characters. <br/><br/>CASABLANCA is often described as one of the best films ever made as well as one of the best-loved. Its reputation is fully deserved. Watch this for yourself to find out why!"
"dbohr","10","1","1","24 July 2002"," Best Romance ever
","Bogart and Bergman should be the standard by how all romances on film are judged.  Casablanca shows them at those heady early days of a romance, the tragic separation, the awkward second encounter, and the compelling story of how they resolve those feelings still inside.<br/><br/>Henreid should not be forgotten.  His style sets up an interesting contrast to the more gruff Bogart.<br/><br/>Rains gives a little comic relief to the film, and also contributes a great deal to the other side of this story: the onset of WWII.  His uncertainty of how much to follow Germany, and whether or not to go against the Nazis, was similar to how many Europeans at the time felt.  His ultimate decision at the end also makes this a great movie.<br/><br/>The final ten minutes of this film is some of the best work ever done in any movie.  If you're a fan of movies, you have to see Casablanca.<br/><br/>10/10"

The story is simple but effectively moving, and the movie is entertaining from beginning to end.  The musical score is magical.<br/><br/>Casablanca is simply a fine example of classical Hollywood cinema.  I watched it with a degree of skepticism, not expecting the movie to live up to its hype, but I was pleasantly surprised when if far exceeded my expectations.

","I can't see this one often enough.  Besides bringing back the team that made The Maltese Falcon and adding the unbelievable Ingrid Bergman at her most beautiful, Claude Raines as just the perfect corrupt slimeball bureaucrat Frenchy trading visas for sex with the cute wives of refugees and Conrad Viedt at his best creating the character upon which Colonel Klink was undoubtedly based.  Peter Lorre as a pathetic loser, Sidney Greenstreet is still ""The Fat Man"" and Bogey is still the hard boiled realist.  The difference to the MF is that instead of a Dashiel Hammet derivative detective story, this one is based on themes from what was the classic story of the early years of Nazi history - the transit visa.  That was the holy grail that meant survival to millions who fled between 1932 and when the borders closed shortly after the fall of Paris.  From this perspective, Ricks actions can be seen not so much as noble self denial but the hard reality that in such times the problems of two lovers ""don't amount to a hill of beans."""

To all of you, let me say: See it on the big screen!!!<br/><br/>It is an experience.<br/><br/>The acting is impeccable.  It is the best Bogart ever, the best Bergman ever, and the best Raines ever.  The script is part love story, part anti-German sentiment, part film noir.  The dialogue is extremely witty; it's comparable to the other film noir, detective films of the time.<br/><br/>The set-up is brilliant.  We have an isolationist American (Bogart), and evil Nazi, and a Frenchman who may or may not be on the side of the Germans. Hmmmmm, that sounds like what actually happened during World War II.  Do you think that means something?  Probably not.<br/><br/>The love story aspect is superb.  Bogart is a typical tough-guy (as we like to see), but that is only his exterior.  He has been hurt by women in his past (something we can all relate to) and has become hardened to his emotions (again, the isolationist).<br/><br/>For a movie that was filmed without a clue as to how it was going to end, it did pretty well for itself.  <br/><br/>In a word: Incredible"

","Is this really a love story? The leading man spends virtually all the film being really nasty to the leading lady, and the only decent thing he does is to give her away at the end to another man! I'd have thought that the real theme of this film is not really ""love"" - the private lives of a few people really don't amount to ""a hill of beans"" - it's heroism. In this respect, Paul Heinreid's part is superbly underplayed: the film would become unbalanced if he outplayed Bogie - he couldn't anyway - but, at the same time, we must think it right that Else ends up with him rather than with Rick. And Henreid is very convincing in projecting this heroism.<br/><br/>The whole thing is so irresistibly entertaining, that we often forget how finely crafted it is. The plot is complex, but we always know what's happening - there's even a little sub-plot included (about a young couple desperate to escape) that reflects the central plot. And, although Rick behaves badly through most of the film, director Michael Curtiz is careful to ensure that he never forfeits the audience's sympathy.<br/><br/>As for the rest, it's all been said before. The most entertaining film ever made? I wouldn't argue with that. On a par, in my book, with ""The Maltese Falcon"", ""The Third Man"" and ""Singin in the Rain""."

"kentig","10","1","1","26 June 1999"," My favorite movie of all time
","Casablanca combines an unforgettable romantic story with the harsh reality of war & danger.  Set in the city of the film's title, we have Rick Blaine, an American running from something (&/or someone), who owns a nightclub in Casablanca, where the Nazi's have taken over.  When Ilsa walks into the nightclub one night, we soon learn that they were lovers in Paris a few years earlier.  When the Germans march into France, Rick & Ilsa are to leave.  Ilsa never shows up at the train station, & Rick is forced to leave without her.  Rick's character in the present is a tortured soul, who is seemingly going thru the motions, looking for a reason to go on, or for a cause worth fighting for.  By the end of the movie, we find that, by doing the noble thing, it not only gives him the impetus to reconstruct his life once again, but also conveys a powerful message to those of us in the audeince, that message being that while you can physically lose the love of your life, spiritually, she will always be with you. The movie has just the right amount of intrigue, romance, and humor to make it the most unforgettable story ever put on the Silver Screen.  All of the characters, major and minor, are perfect in their roles.  Humphrey Bogart's portrayal of Rick has left an indelible mark on his entire career & life. Ingrid Bergman - Oh, those wet & hypnotic eyes at the climactic end. Claude Raines as Louie adds just the right touch of cynicism & change of pace humor.  Paul Henreid's Victor Laslo inflicts the needed patriotism into the film.  As a matter of fact, both Rick's & Victor's unyielding love for Ilsa is so genuine, that the ending, where Victor goes off with Ilsa, seems so right, as though there shouldn't be any losers in this ""game"".  The evilness of Major Strasser adds the right tone. Casablanca - an all time classic."

"Muldrake-2","10","1","1","15 June 1999"," On my very short list of must sees
","Casablanca has every right to be considered amongst the best ever made because of its timelessness. As noted in another comment, Casablanca remains as complex, funny, romantic, and full of suspense as it did when it first graced the silver screen nearly 60 years ago. I recommend it often, and rarely do my friends not thoroughly enjoy the film, despite the fact that most of my friends and I were not born until 35 years after it was written. Those few that didn't like it simply don't like anything in black and white, which is their loss I suppose (the colorized version, to be frank, sucks). In short, if you enjoy movies and can stand B&W, then you should watch this film. Even if you don't like most B&W films you should watch it; odds are you'll like this one."

Humphrey Bogart's bar owner cynic is hilarious and pathetic today as he was 55 years ago. Claude Rains's ambiguous little policeman is a delightful caricature. And Ingrid Bergman, whose beauty is to this day is unsurpassed, lights up every frame with her luminous presence. Definitely one for the library!"

","Though IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE, THE BEST YEARS OF OUR LIVES, STAGE DOOR, ALL ABOUT EVE, and many many others I can't think of right now are very close, CASABLANCA is my favorite from the so-called ""classic"" era of Hollywood.  It brings together all the elements of entertainment and transcends them into a work of art.  Story, direction, music, theme, acting, dialogue; all are operating at perfection here.  If studios were regularly turning out movies like these today, the movie industry wouldn't be in any trouble.  Pauline Kael once said CITIZEN KANE was more fun than any other great movie she could think of.  For me, it's this one.  A masterpiece."
"Don-102","10","1","1","19 February 1999"," Hollywood System Gem...absolute must!
","There is really not much you can say about the greatness of this movie because of its universal timelessness and appeal.  A famous love story with Nazis and war as a backdrop.  Rick and Ilsa, the interrupted love affair renewed, this time each knowing that they must sacrifice their love for a larger good.  The famous saloon, where international bravado rules and exit visas are rampantly desired.<br/><br/>This is undoubtedly the funniest and most cynical of Bogart's characters and Bergman is an absolute stunner.  My favorite shot in the film is that of Bergman as she looks out of the corner of her eye for Rick as Laszlo goes to the bar.  It is a quick dolly in to her right side, her look explaining everything.  This is a movie you must own if you're a film lover.  It can be watched over and over."

","Well, it is hard to say anything about this movie which has not been already said. But even though nowadays film makers have millions $ and thousands of hi-tech effects to film whatever they want, they should always come to movies like Casablanca to see how great performance can be done just with cleverly chosen music, brilliant acting and dialogues. Of course the movie is dependent on circumstances under which it was made and nobody would believe that things would really happen exactly like that, but the heck with it - it can easily be forgiven. And regarding the fact it was filmed in 40's when the war was far from being finished, the propagandistic aspect of the movie could have been far worse. The atmosphere of the movie is absolutely awesome and I think that nobody can declare himself to be a movie fan unless he saw Casablanca."
"cldavisj","10","1","1","28 January 2002"," Casablanca at 60
","With the possible, arguable, exception of Citizen Kane, this is THE finest piece of celluloid ever to exist. I give it a notch over Kane because it has the romantic interest of Bergman and Bogey (Elsa and Rick) as a second powerful sub-plot. The casting is perfect, the story is exciting, supporting characters have (in the ensuing 6 decades) become as memorable and important as the leads. If you buy DVD's, get this one or Kane first. These films will be the basis on which to compare all others that have come before or after. If they are dated..well then so be it. Great stories transcend time (how many remakes of Romeo & Juliet exist for example?) and Casablanca is such.<br/><br/>The multiple tales of human folly, fear, death, hate, love and living for a higher purpose are seamlessly integrated into a hundred-odd minutes of magical story telling. Will anyone make a film like this again? No...that would be impossible. Perhaps come close but never exceed this perfect example of the motion picture arts. And art it is. If it were a painting it would hang in the Louvre, if a song, comparable with Beethoven's 9th, if a book, it would be on the shelf next to Shakespear's First Folio. Enough...see the movie...again.

That they were not the first choice for their respective roles (Ronald Reagan, Dennis Morgan and Ann Sheridan were the first choices) challenges all understanding.

","The true value of a movie is measured by its ability to overcome generation gaps, time, and trends and still remain a true winner.

","It's hard to think of something new to contribute to the commentary on one of the best-loved and most-discussed of all films. But my affection for Casablanca prompts me to try.<br/><br/>I watch the film about once every two years, and every time I get something more out of it--maybe because I'm a little older each time. It strikes me as a very adult film, as opposed to most of the movies put out today that seem aimed at the 14-year-old in all of us. As time goes on, I find myself relating more and more to Rick and Renault: cynical, world-weary, but bemused by the folly around them and content as long as they're left alone. That is, until events conspire to present them with a choice: abandon completely any ideals you may have once held, or take a stand for them.<br/><br/>Rick's choice, his solution, is one that most of us hope we would have the courage and nobility to make. And what a brave choice for a Hollywood movie to make: the hero doesn't get the girl! Instead, he gets back his soul. Casablanca dares to say something that few artists or politicians in our self-centred, post-WWII age are willing to say: that sacrifice can be more important, more worthwhile, even more satisfying, than reward.<br/><br/>Granted, Casablanca may not be the best film ever made. The Godfather, Schindler's List, and Citizen Kane are, doubtless, ""greater"" films, more important films. Mention them to a film buff and you'll get an astute, respectful nod. But mention this one and you'll get a delighted smile."

Peter Lorre, Dooley Wilson, Claude Rains, Conrad Veidt, Paul Henreid and Ingrid Bergman are all fantastic, but none compete with Humphrey Bogart. The best word to describe his character, Rick, is simply...cool. Rick is the embodiment of cool, and Bogart plays him incredibly. How he did not win Best Actor for this movie, I do not understand.<br/><br/>There are so many powerful and fantastic scenes in this movie, it's difficult to list them all. I love the anthem showdown, Rick meeting Ilsa again for the first time in years, Sam playing the piano for a drunken and depressed Rick, and especially the ending. This is probably the most moving ending in cinema history. There are also so many great lines in this movie. My heart skips a beat every time I hear ""Here's looking at you, kid"", ""We'll always have Paris"", the ""Play it Sam"" lines, the ""hill of beans"" line, ""kiss me as if it were the last time"", ""maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow..."", ""I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship"", etc.<br/><br/>I don't think there has ever been better movie chemistry than that of Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman. Never, ever has a romance film been as powerful as this one.

","If you are a patriotic person you will ""know"" that to win a war requires great sacrifices of your own desires, wants, and needs. Here, in Casablanca we have a simple story, of which the movie producers themselves didn't think would become such a classic, which has captured the hearts of all who see this movie.<br/><br/>Humphrey Bogart as Rick Blaine is a man's man. He is courageous and fights a war on his terms with his own resources. The beautiful Ingrid Bergman portrays a woman (Ilsa Lund Laszlo) torn between her true love and her duty to her husband whom she once believed was killed in the war. The moral is that ""duty"" takes precedence over personal feelings.<br/><br/>Paul Henreid as Victor Laszlo the ""underground resistance leader"" plays his role straight with dedication to the cause of freedom and ""understanding"" when he learns of Ilsa and Rick's past affair in Paris, France. The most inspiring part was when Victor leads a song challenge with the French National Anthem in Rick's club against the boastful German Army. The emotion of this scene was so strong that it brings tears to the eyes of any true patriot.<br/><br/>If you are a lover of Peter Lorre, Sydney Greenstreet, and Claude Rains, you will find classic performances here! Conrad Veidt played the German Major Strasser to form. I understand that Madeleine LeBeau (Yvonne)is actually French and you can see the tears of patriotism on her face as she sings a most inspiring rendition of Le Marseillaise (French National Anthem).<br/><br/>Dooley Wilson plays Rick's piano player in Casablanca.

","Few people need an introduction to this movie, altho there is always a first time for everyone.  But also for those who have seen it already, I wish to share a few thoughts.  My favorite scene is the singing of La Marseilles; remember, this is a movie about passion and good and evil, altho the ending and many other scenes are also great.  I also find it interesting that this was a play before, and many did not think it as effective as a play, but it worked so well as a movie.  The backdrop and the skills of film makers can add a lot (and the acting).  But although Ingrid Bergman fit in well here, I thought that the acting jobs by Bogart and others, purely in terms of being convincing, were better.  Excellent scenery, elegant French culture, so well scripted, and idealistic.  Yet altho Rick changed at the end, his person throughout the bulk of the movie allows a good outlet for people feeling life's frustrations.  But even for those, it is rousing to have the good ending, isn't it?"

The movie sort of becomes a story of star-crossed lovers. The movie is both stylish and brilliant. This is a classic that well be with us forever. I give this move 5/5.

","Arguably the greatest movie that was ever made..now famous for all the problems on set and casting decisions that couldve been made..until the stars all met. Bogie, Bergman, Paris, War, love, romance, adventure, this movie has it all. When it was made - late 41 early 42 (it was released in late nov 42) - World War two was by no means decided so this film also serves as a morale booster as the seemingly uncaring Bogie for love of a woman finds a conscience and helps win the freedom of a country. The metaphors are present if one looks: Bogie being US Bergman and husband being the allies..and of course the Nazi being the Nazi. Casablanca, translated from french, White House. An absolute masterpiece of a movie. A must see for all. On a scale of one to ten... 10 Best drama i have seen and the second best film (behind only Dear America: Letters Home from Vietnam)"

","I first saw Casablanca on the big screen.  It was around 1993.  I was visiting a friend at the University of Missouri who had a load of work to do on her Master's Thesis.  So, her boyfriend and I went to see it in the student union.  It's a shame that, being a guy, I first saw this incredibly romantic love story with another guy, but it still jerked tears.  I was most amazed with how the familiar and famous lines, so many of which were already part of my psyche, just kept coming and coming.<br/><br/>Now, I own the movie and have most of it memorized.  I get a great thrill from introducing it to people, watching them hear those line for the first time in context.  I teach English now and use the film as a study in plot, foreshadowing, and Freytag's Triangle (or Climactic Triangle).<br/><br/>As a list maker, i have for years made favorite movies lists.  This went straight to number one after my first viewing and is so entrenched there that only an act of God would break it from that spot.

I've seen almost everything made from 1980 to today.  Recently, I've started to see more 70's movies.  Then I jumped back to the 40's with Casablanca.

I've never seen acting this good, it just doesn't exsist anymore.  The story is great.  This is one of the only romantic movies I've ever seen that I think both guys and women can like.  Mainly because the romance, while it is at the heart of the story, is not the ONLY focus of the film.<br/><br/>Seriously, how can you possibly not like this movie.  How I ask?  You can't, that's how.  If you haven't seen the movie, see it, because you're robbing yourself of something great.

","What to say of Casablanca? It's one of the most beloved films of all time, its romance and immortal lines have brought it into history. It's really an ordinary film, even Ingrid Bergman has so commented. The cinematography is nothing to gawk at, nor does the film possess any godsends of technical achievement, nor was it expected of run-of-the-mill director Michael Curtiz. The play it was based on, Everybody Comes to Rick's, was second-rate even in 1942. <br/><br/>But the acting is something special. At the time, Humphrey Bogart, Ingrid Bergman, and Paul Henreid were hardly household names. Bogart, then just establishing himself as a serious actor, nearly lost the lead role to actor George Raft. Raft refused to have a nobody like Ingrid Bergman be his costar. While Bogart lost that year's Oscar to Paul Lukas, this is his most famous if not best performance. Bergman was passed over come Oscar night, but she too gives a great performance, bursting with the tangible emotion necessary for her part. However, I must first tip my cap to Claude Rains, who plays Captain Louis Renault. He is one of great character actors, and never have I seen him more in character.<br/><br/>But the true star of Casablanca is the Oscar-winning screenplay, the brainchild of playwrights Julius and Philip Epstein. The screenplay has brought its lines to the lips and minds of even those unfortunate enough to have never seen the film. Lines like `Here's looking at you kid' and `Louis, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship'.<br/><br/>Lastly, there's that song, As Time Goes By. It's never completely played, in fact its almost just squeezed into the film. It's an ordinary song, but it's the song of Rick and Ilsa (Bogart and Bergman) and that makes it incredible; so much that my heart fills with remembrance of this beautiful film whenever I see it.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen it; see it. 10/10 Stars"
"ocishihara","10","1","1","5 October 2000"," I hate ""love"" movies but I love Casablanca.
","Call me cynical, but I hate romance movies.  Maybe it's because I'm tired of the usual familiar superficial love stories, where love is merely an abstraction of a self-centered/self-satisfying emotion.  Yet despite this, ""Casablanca"" remains as one of my all-time favorite movies.  It's hard to say what makes this movie so great.  Maybe its because it delivers a much more REAL romance, of self-sacrificial love; or maybe its more simply that Ingrid Bergman is possible the most gorgeous woman to ever walk on this planet since the great Helen of Troy.  Whatever the reason, ""Casablanca"" remains genuine, flawless, and an example of greatness."
"Tresix","10","1","1","29 September 2000"," THE Standard
","I can honestly say I know what makes a good movie because I have a standard by which to compare it:  CASABLANCA.  Adapted from a play entitled ""Everyone Comes to Rick's"", CASABLANCA tells the story of American Rick Blaine (Humphrey Bogart in the role that made his legend), a cynical saloon owner. His motto:  ""I stick my neck out for nobody.  I'M the only cause worth fighting for.""  We learn that, in the past, Rick was once an idealistic man who would fight the good fight for just causes.  As his ""friend"" Louie (Claude Rains) reminds him as he ticks off the underdog causes that Rick has championed ""The winning side would have paid MUCH more.""  Just when we are convinced that Rick truly is an insular hard-case . . . into his life returns Ilsa Lund (Ingrid Bergman), the woman who killed the idealism in him.  She is on the arm of freedom fighter Victor Laslo (Paul Heinreid). The sight of Ilsa sparks a flashback that shows Rick, Ilsa and Rick's piano-playing friend Sam (Dooley Wilson) in Paris before the arrival of the Nazis.  As Rick and Sam wait for Ilsa, she sends him a note at the train station saying that she can never see him again.  That is, until their paths cross again in Casablanca.  To add to the stress, the Nazis, led by the pinch-faced Major Strasser (Conrad Veidt), decide to march into Casablanca as well.  Their intent:  To capture Laslo and prevent him from stirring up strength against the Nazis on the other side of the world. CASABLANCA benefits greatly from a dynamite script, great directing and, for once, the perfect union of casting and character.  By now, most people know how the film ends.  This is even more impressive since the ending to the film was being written even as the cameras began rolling to shoot it.  Two endings had been written, but when the producers saw the ending that was shot (the one used in the film), they saw no need to shoot the other ending.  Needless to say, CASABLANCA is a part of my film library. If it's not in your's, you're only depriving yourself."

The heroes and the villains are equally revered. Probably the greatest assemblage of international acting talent filmed during the penultimate period of international stress. It reflected the contradictions people have between personal wants and needs, and those that encompass the greater good.<br/><br/>This film begs for young and old alike to be transfixed by the acting, the storyline, and an ending which leaves everyone a sense of honor and fulfillment. I strongly recommend, if you become or are a fan of Casablanca, to read the book...Round Up The Usual Suspects. It'll give you insights into the filming and the accidents of fate which helped create this American movie legend and made Bogart a film icon forever."

","Is Casablanca one of the great movies, or is it a cheesy WWII propaganda film.  For the record, it was a propaganda film. Art and propaganda do not generally mix. This movie has a tremendous cast, a good sound track and great director. But all the characters on ""our side"" were stereotped as generous, heroic or lovable. The characters on the ""other side"" are pathetically sterotyped as evil in Nazi uniforms. My critque of this movie is not about Nazi's and the good guys. As time passes, and this movie is viewed by generations who have no personal contact with the period portrayed in this movie, the major defect that I see in this great film will become evident to more people. Movies made during war time, on all sides had to overcome this hurdle. Stanly Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove, made during the early 60's at the height of the cold war, is a better movie because his characters and plot are not plastic imitations of good or evil people."

"mivince79","10","1","1","7 July 2000"," A tale of the burnt out idealist and the redemption of his soul.
","Casablanca is an enduring epic about the indomitability of the human spirit. Beside the obvious charisma and passion of the leading actors, Bogart and Bergman, it is also a glorious tale about the human condition. It is a tale about idealism, and idealism gone stale. It is a tale of greed, fear, resignation, smugness, indifference, and re-birth. In short, this is a monumental film about the vortex of human emotions that make up life as we know it, day in and day out.<br/><br/>Bogart and Bergman elude an electricity and a tension that permeates the entire drama. But these brilliant performances are enhanced by the wonderful supporting cast of real, down to earth, ""just plain folks"" character actors of the day. In their stellar performances we see Everyman: the idealists; the hopeful and the hopeless; the greedy, the needy, the brutal sadists, and the tender hearted. It is ourselves we see in the craggy faces which surround Rick and Ilsa. Unfortunately, we no longer see such faces in today's cinema. For it was their genuine ""ordinariness"" which shone so brilliantly from the screen, that grabbed us so tightly and swept us up into the turmoil of the story. It was the plainness of these supporting characters that framed the swirling epic raging round them, so unlike today's performers, who seemed to have stepped out from the pages of Elle and GQ with their polished good looks and vacuous performances.<br/><br/>Casablanca is also an epic tale of the burnt out idealist in all of us who have pulled against the grain, but who, like Rick, have lost once too often. It is the tale of the twentieth-century. It is about a man who has spent all he had to spend, whose spirit which once burned with the fiery idealism of youth, is now but a flicker, only to be re-ignited once again by a lost love. It is an idealism rekindled by memories of joy and heartache, of a love lost and now regained--for a brief moment. For Rick is like all of us, far from perfect. In the deepest recesses of his heart, there is a war raging, one which rocks him to the very depths. The better angels of his long suppressed idealism struggle with his cynicism, his burning desire and his passion to be reunited once more with Ilsa, his first and only love. The good of the many takes precedence over the good of the one. It was that spirit that characterized the times, times long past and long forgotten. But times, nevertheless, whose idealism and generosity of spirit are sorely missing from our world today."

There were holes in the plot and the romance was deeply expressed but unconvincing because it was undeveloped.

The 50 year-plus film has aged gracefully, and stays just as entertaining as the last time I watched it.<br/><br/>I honestly can't say what I like the most about it: The cast, the dialogue, the humor, the story, the romance, the national pride....  There's not just one thing that's great about this movie; each part is so integral to this film that it would be impossible to imagine anything altered in the slightest.  This is the best film that I've seen Bogart in, and his sarcastic, no-nonsense attitude makes him the perfect ""anti-hero"": A man who seems cynical to the world, yet risks it all to do what he believes is right.  This was a very ""noble"" film in its principles.<br/><br/>There are very few films that I'll give a ""10"" on the rating system.  This was a no-brainer for me.  This didn't just set the standards for future movies, this IS the movies.  My only regret is that it took me as long as it did to see it originally two years ago.  A perfect movie if one ever existed."
"mermatt","Null","1","1","30 July 1998"," One of the great films
","I have seen the film many times. It is an amazingly durable piece. It endures because of the underlying meaning -- a man is faced with the choice of being a responsible person or simply following his emotional whims. Every character has some interesting quality or quirk. I have used the film in my classes to make the point of how a good story can have a deeper meaning without coming across as a sermon."

","OK.. I don't understand why people praise this as the best movie of all time? I just don't find anything special in this movie. The film starts real sloooooooow and I almost fell asleep waiting for Bogart's character to appear and I waited half an hour for Ingrid's character to appear. A real disappoinment!"

","The acting is cheesy (Bogart is his usual plastic self), but acceptable considering the time it was made.  The dialogue is only good if you pretend that it's done tongue in cheek (which it isn't -- and if you are of the opinion that lines like ""Is that cannon fire or the beating of my heart?"" and ""I can't think anymore, so you think for both of us!"" are not laughable, then you are wallowing in self-denial.  I'll bet you saw Titanic more than twice in the theaters, too...)<br/><br/>This is often called a war movie, but don't be fooled -- it's even less about war than Gone With the Wind, which is to say that there *is* a war happening, but it's largely irrelevant as a plot contrivance (which, incidentally, is entirely inaccurate from a historical prospective.  There was no such thing as a letter of transit).<br/><br/>In essence, a glorified chick-flick which will hopefully fall away into nostalgic obscurity as my generation continually thrusts spectacular films by Kubrick (may he rest in peace), Fincher (well, Fight Club and Seven, anyway)and Ridley into the forefront."

","Even though people think it is one of the best films out there, I just think the accents in it were terrible. The only two persons accents I could understand, was Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman as their main characters. I cant understand why I understood them better than the other characters because, the actors who did the fake thick Moroccan accents, were just so hard to listen to! I just had to skip to the ending where it was only just the characters Rick and Isla saying farewell to each other so, she was able to get away from the war. <br/><br/>I would've liked to enjoy it but, unfortunately that wasn't the case with watching this movie.

","WARNIG! Don't watch Casablanca because you will regret it, ""Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but soon and for the rest of your life.""<br/><br/>The biggest travesty and atrocity a kid could ever be inflected with, is when you're given the crushing blow that Santa is not real. Well take that dreadful feeling and then multiply it by a thousand, and you might just be able understand the heart wrenching pain that I felt after so many years of eager anticipation to watch supposedly one of the greatest films of all time, only to find out the hard way upon watching Casablanca, that the film doesn't live up to anywhere close to all the hype surrounding it. Trust me finding that Rudolf, the elves and Santa workshop didn't exist was a walk in the park compared to this! <br/><br/>1941 was in the grips of a deadly second world war, but while the rest of Europe was going up in flames, Rick Blaine (Humphrey Bogart) was living it up in the sun, sea and sand of Morocco where he remained entirely neutral whilst cozying it up in a nightclub and gambling den in Casablanca. But trouble is at foot as the Germans come looking for a famous Czech Resistance fugitive leader by the name of Victor Lazio. But then to shovel another tone onto Ricks plate; ""Of all the gin joints in all the towns in all the world, she walks into mine."" The love of his life Ilsa (Ingrid Bergman) that once broke his heart returns to cause trouble again. <br/><br/>Okay so what's wrong with it, gosh there is so much to point out, I'm going dizzy just thinking about it. Now I'm sat down, let me make it easier for myself, what's good about it...umm well? I'm stumped, I've literally scratched my head so much, I think I've left myself with a bald patch. The first blatant criticism is the rotten acting that leaves a wretched smell in the air and horrible unsavoury taste in the mouth. Like come on if I wanted to see such wooden performance I would go to a Shakespeare in the park where all the character are played by actual trees! Imagine how many times in the entire film did Rick ever show even a flicker of emotion in the film, the answer is (drum roll please) zero, cero and null. But this ain't an episode of who wants to be a millionaire and I'm not Terry Crews, so don't be expecting any cash prizes. Instead from Rick all you get is one long continuous monotone delivery of each and every line, which unfortunately to my ears sounds similar to a heart monitor flat lining. But don't think for a moment that Ilsa will resuscitate the morbid desolation that becomes of Casablanca at the hands of Rick. Because Ilsa has the habit of always turning smiles upside down, her character has no backbone and merely sways back and forth between both Lazio (Husband) and Rick like she were a hula skirt in the wind anytime she sees fit. In the entire film I'm pretty sure she doesn't have a single thought in the film that doesn't involve either one of the two men. <br/><br/>However on a good note, while the acting was crummy, the words coming from their mouths were surprisingly rather good. I've used quite a few quotes from the film in my review because the dialogue in Casablanca was clever, witty and enjoyable to hear and thus quite right the scriptwriter pair of the Epstein brothers and Howard Koch received Oscar recognition for their exploits. Also what I do applaud is the way Michael Curtiz weaves into the film the ethos of always having the courage to resist and triumphing against whatever evil the world may try to put in your way. Anytime you see inside of Rick's bar it is constantly brimming with joy and happiness, which is a refreshing sight to witness when you consider that above all their heads is suffocating Nazi shaped black cloud. The best illustration of this is in the scene where Victor he spurs the customers in Rick's cafe to a deifying yet beautiful rendition of Marseillaise, effectively drowning out the chorus of Nazis singing. But don't confuse my compliments with me softening up to Casablanca, the film still sucks!"
"dunmore_ego","6","5","12","17 December 2010"," We'll Always Have Overacting.
","Leonard Maltin calls CASABLANCA ""The best Hollywood movie of all time""; it won the 1943 Best Picture Oscar; voted #2 film of all time by the American Film Institute; Roger Ebert effuses, ""Casablanca is THE movie""; it boasts one of the most regal Hollywood stars in Ingrid Bergman (in the movie that would catapult her to stardom), and the cynical founder of the Holmby Hills Rat Pack, Humphrey Bogart, one of the eras manly sex symbols, even though his face resembled the underside of a running shoe.<br/><br/>Some movies were great back then, and stay great: CITIZEN KANE, SEVEN SAMURAI, GENTLEMAN'S AGREEMENT. Poor CASABLANCA has dated badly - due to censorship at the time not allowing the filmmakers to solidly portray a married woman cheating, censorship on what could be shown on screen to denote ""passionate affair,"" contention over the nihilistic lead character necessarily having a heart of gold, the faults go on. After decades of progress in American film, CASABLANCA, though it has insinuated itself into popular vernacular as a ""great film,"" is nothing more than a talky cardboard romance thriller, with overacting threatening to send us into a melodramatic swoon and enough soft-focus on Ingrid Bergman to make us cross-eyed.<br/><br/>During World War II, Rick (Bogart) and Ilsa (Bergman) had a steamy love affair in Paris, which involved lots of kissing with their mouths closed and lots of hugging with their clothes on. Years later, Rick runs a gin joint in Casablanca, The Café Americain, a stopover in Morocco for refugees from Nazi-occupied Europe on their way to America. It's kinda like the Cantina in STAR WARS, except all the aliens are illegal. Peter Lorre cameos as Chewbacca, and Sam the piano player (Dooley Wilson) plays As Time Goes By by flapping his hands up and down on the keys like a seal. ""You badly synched it for her, you can badly synch it for me."" <br/><br/>When Ilsa and her activist husband Victor Laszlo (Paul Henreid) seek egress through Casablanca to The States, they seek out Rick at his Café (""Of all the gin joints in all the towns in all the world, she walks her pointy bra into mine""), knowing he has Letters of Transit that would confuse the Nazi stormtroopers hunting them due to Laszlo causing a great disturbance in the Resistance on Tattooine. ""These aren't the droids you want. Move along."" And Rick and Ilsa reignite their love affair by meeting in dark rooms and talking a lot with their clothes on. Rick's refrain, ""We'll always have Paris"" makes us wonder why he doesn't tear off her pointed bra and make Casablanca the new Paris. <br/><br/>Everyone constantly drinking and smoking, yet no one ever gets drunk enough to have a Sexy Party. Censorship, thou frigid mistress.<br/><br/>Claude Rains is an unscrupulous, stylish weasel of a frog, a French officer who is nonchalantly AC/DC when it comes to helping either Rick or the Germans - whoever can benefit him the most. Conrad Veidt is Nazi Strasser, bedecked incorrectly in a Luftwaffe uniform.<br/><br/>Evidence abounds that CASABLANCA would not make it through today's muster onto the silver screen. Based on the play by Murray Burnett and Joan Alison, Everybody Comes to Rick's, IMDb trivia tells us ""in 1980 this script was sent to readers at a number of major studios and production companies under its original title. Some readers recognized the script but most did not. Many complained that the script was ""not good enough"" to make a decent movie. Others gave such complaints as ""too dated,"" ""too much dialog"" and 'not enough sex."""" According to actress Geraldine Fitzgerald, Bogart and Bergman themselves ""thought the dialogue was ridiculous and the situations were unbelievable...""<br/><br/>Yet the movie remains a classic for most film aficionados. Back when they were starstruck kids it was ""the beginning of a beautiful friendship."" Ah, to me, ""the problems of three little people don't amount to a hill o' beans in this crazy world."" <br/><br/>I couldn't have melodramatically stated it better, Humphrey."
"parhat","1","30","113","6 April 2005"," Looks like the story was written by a six year old
","The movie is predictable, the lines are predictable, Bogart chain smokes all the time. The ending is predictable. The acting is stiffed. People watching the plane flying over looks like they were acting.<br/><br/>I went to comatose over 10 times. Rewatched it by hanging myself upside down with my pet bat and still couldn't feel anything for the movie. I was again forced fed to watch to understand why these monkey brained movie critics liked about the movie and I still couldn't stand it. It is obvious that Ingrid Bergman is running away, and why is it that Bogart don't get a bit suspicious? He could get suspicious and just still like the woman with a double feelings for her by reminiscing that incidence.<br/><br/>Oh yeah bitter Bogart, and yeah cynical Bogart became idealistic in the end. And good friend the stupid cop also decides to become idealistic also, but what are the mathematical odds against this scenario? But isn't that stupid? Isn't the ending a bit messy for Bogart and the cop just for just silly women? I mean the ending is so predictable and I guessed the ending of the movie since the beginning of the romance, breakup and welcome back and another (I will not mention the ending)... but you could have guessed.<br/><br/>Couldn't the ending be like this: Bogart doesn't even have to sell his entire business - he can just get a partnership and still retain the interests, and what happened to poor Sam the piano player - throw away an old pal and cop and Bogart become fugitive? No way! Even in real life, it would be fair to say that if I were Bogart, I would dump the woman anyway since she had a previous boyfriend. It just not credible. And what to do if Bogart shot the police who tries to inform the authorities? Simple just pay your local cop under the table and it's business as usual.<br/><br/>Do you really need to sell the ownership of Cafe Americain? That would be a stupid idea. Even if Bogart was under house arrest, he can still escape and yet still maintain his control through his old pal the Piano player Sam and if that's not possible just get another partnership to run the show. He can also retain control by through his banks and his check signing, etc. without having to be physically present at Cafe Americain.<br/><br/>Again poor choices of Bogart a cynical man should have some business shrewdness like him should have been a bit more practical in his business affair without having to sacrifice any idealism for love, romance or anything else that comes his way.<br/><br/>Is there other ways to NOT SELL Bogart business? Yes there are other ways. You can lease the business on a 10 year basis with furniture, equipment, Sam the piano player etc. and once the lease is over, he can get the ownership back. Or how about another idea, franchising? Just franchise Cafe Americain to your competitors and collect royalties. I mean there are a lot of ways out here, but no one who watches the movie tries to imagine the best way out for these poor creatures (Bogart, cop and Sam). <br/><br/>The cop in the end of the story is very unlikely to run away, but he can be just part of the cover-up. In fact there weren't any witness anyway. And why would he do the cover-up? Simple: he also gets the commissions from the Roulette wheel.<br/><br/>Because of the messy ending and see-sawing of story, I can see clearly that the writers were a bit messy and undecided and therefore decide to put every trash into the movie and crossed their fingers, while making sure the main point of the ""fair ending"" is o.k. but did not clear all the loose ends.<br/><br/>So much for a story that is poorly written! Get real. The story is not even close to realism!"
"jldmp1","6","4","9","9 September 2006"," The Eyes Have It
","To get straight to the point as to why I don't give this special praise: it's obsolete. Not the plot - I mean the whole manner of storytelling. It's passé, where something like ""Citizen Kane"" still speaks to us. <br/><br/>The center of this, of course, is Bogart - an old-style Real Man, not unlike John Wayne. His acting is tight and mannered, to reflect what was expected in those days - tight control of emotional expression, control of the situation, no irony whatsoever...All sentiment is quickly dissolved in alcohol.<br/><br/>That said, what IS worth watching is how Bergman carries emotional content - specifically, within her eyes, which tell all. ""Here's looking at you"", indeed. It's honest, and Bogie feeds off of it.<br/><br/>And how the musical 'accompaniment' moves the pieces on the chess board. The famous ""As time goes by"" and ""La Marseillaise"" are the expressions of this force which buffets the actors within the romance, and the actors within the political intrigues. The musical performances are both 'staged for us', as was de rigeur back then, but also is indispensable to the larger narrative.<br/><br/>Worth at least one screening, but do take it with a grain of salt."

","I can see why men like this movie. How great to own your own bar, have a cool reputation for cynicism and dry wit, and most of all, have a desirable woman so in love with you she's ready to leave her war hero husband for you if you just snap your fingers. Of course, it's even better to be Rick, when he makes the great sacrifice of putting her on the plane with her husband. Ahhh, sit back, have a smoke.<br/><br/>But why on earth do women like this? Ilsa is a completely passive, spineless thing who stands around sipping drinks while the men make all her decisions for her. What a total lack of moral courage, to let someone else determine whether or not she leaves her husband? Even the mix-up in Paris seems rather lacking in initiative on her part -- couldn't she have made some excuse to slip out long enough to send a telegram to the train station? I didn't even enjoy identifying with Ingrid Bergman's fabled beauty, because, frankly, without the soft focus lens she's just a round faced, thin lipped woman with a jutting nose.<br/><br/>I love old movies, the ones made in the forties are my favorites. Paul Henried, Claude Raines and Bette Davis were wonderful together in ""Now Voyager."" Barbara Stanwyck made dozens of great movies during those years. Joan Crawford and Lana Turner played strong women. Gene Tierney and Hedy Lamar were breathtaking beauties.

","I had seen many films, but none were like Casablanca, it's duologue never failed, and it can touch the hearts of many without being too too touchy and romantic. It also has many plot lines, which is no mistake to the directors, because for some of them, it answers them as soon as you see them, it answers them in the middle, it leaves it for the end, or cliff hangs you on with not a single intention for a sequel. Besides, a sequel will destroy it's premise. While many actors are excellent in the supporting cast, Humphrey Bogart is spectacular as the selfish, money loving, one-woman, man, but gets his heart at the end. It's shocking that he didn't win the Oscar, (well he was nominated.) And this film never gets too predictable, when you pause, you still look at the single frame, looking for clues. This film is to be enjoyed for people of all ages, for the present and future."

","This is my favorite movie of all time. Absolutely stunning direction, fabulous script, fantastic cast, and timeless love story of sacrifice to a greater cause. Bogart's Rick is possibly the best anti-hero in cinematic history (""I stick my neck out for no man!""). The quotes (and MIS-quotes) from this movie lend credit to its timeless appeal! From the first entrance into Rick's café (expertly done through the use of a moving camera) you are drawn into a world of intrigue, love, lust for power, desperation and hope that was North Africa in the WWII era. The black & white photography allows the director to create and use shadows to set mood and tension. The script moves along at a breakneck pace until the final scene when our hero's true colors are revealed. Let's face it. If you don't see this movie you'll regret it. Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but soon and for the rest of your life."

It's fun to spend two hours in Casablanca with Rick and Sam and Ilsa and all their far-flung friends. But when you come down to it it's not much of a story; whether it doesn't make logical sense or is just too boring to follow is something I've never decided, and lines like ""Play it, Sam"" and ""I stick my neck out for no one"" are famous because of who said them in a gorgeous white linen jacket, not what's being said. Like ""Dracula"" or ""Titanic,"" it's appealing as entertainment. But to label it ""great"" is to give this little fluffy war romance more weight than it was ever meant to bear."

I have never been a fan of black and white movies, and this is exactly why. The storyline moved quite slowly with very little action. The acting was predictable and hollow. The love story seemed rushed. You never get the sense that the two really cared about each other while courting in Paris.

","I'm a fan of almost everyone who appears in Casablanca, at least in every other movie they were ever in. Bogart, Bergman, Rains, Greenstreet, Lorre, and so on. But I think that Casablanca made its biggest impression when it came out, in the heat of WWII, and its reputation has carried it along ever since. I'm certain that very few will agree with me on this, but I think that many occasional movie watchers and many would-be experts like to chatter about this film's ""greatness"", when in fact, it has very little of that. Number one problem for me is Bogart as anyone's love interest --- think about this: his very best performances weren't romantic, or anywhere near it(I give ""African Queen"" a comedy designation). The other problem is the dated silliness (in the so-called comic characters) that I suppose was put in to balance the seriousness of being stranded in Casablanca with Nazis buzzing around everywhere. Then there's that ever-present song...not bad, but very over-used. Since I know I'll stir up a lot of folks, I apologize for criticizing the ""perfect film"", but there are just too many truly great ones out there to get all blubbery about this one. Entertaining for its time period, but not great. But cheer up, Casablanca fans, we'll always have Gaslight, Notorious, Maltese Falcon, and Treasure of the Sierra Madre'."

"majikstl","8","3","7","9 May 2007"," ""The fundamental things apply ....""
","CASABLANCA is one strange little movie. It takes place in French Morocco and is populated with characters and actors from all over war-torn Europe, yet it is quintessentially American. It is rich in humor, but it isn't a comedy. It is a war movie, but its one great battle sequence is the singing of rival national anthems. It is plotted like a soap opera -- indeed, it is essentially a ""woman's picture"" -- but is directed like a spy movie. It is a film filled with intrigue, but offers only a vague sense of danger -- mostly it is about people standing around talking. <br/><br/>Considered one of the most romantic movies of all times, there is little romance and only fleeting moments of passion. Romance and heroism are defined not by what the characters do, but what they don't do. It is about sacrifice, doing without now in the hopes that it will benefit the greater good. The great triumph at the end finds two lovers parting ways, probably never to see each other again. And, yet, that is the happy ending as nobility conquers cynicism. <br/><br/>Long before I actually saw CASABLANCA, I had already seen bits and pieces, read about it in reviews and film history books, and even owned the screenplay. It was parodied in one of my favorite films, Woody Allen's PLAY IT AGAIN, SAM. Its famed dialogue had long since become beloved cliché. So, when I finally saw the film, it was anticlimactic; I knew the story, the dialogue and even the ending -- watching it was like watching a rerun, nothing seemed fresh. I was vaguely disappointed. <br/><br/>But over the years I've viewed it again and again, and liked it a bit more each time. I'm still not ready to concede that it is one of the great films, yet it succeeds at being something more; any failings it has as drama are inconsequential compared to its status as a cultural icon. It transcends being a mere movie and is as much of the American pop psyche as ""Yankee Doodle Dandy,"" ""Tom Sawyer,"" Norman Rockwell's paintings, Graceland and the '57 Chevy. America would be just a little less great without it.<br/><br/>Basically, the film is a standard love triangle: Ilsa (Ingrid Bergman) finds herself torn between the dark, mysterious Rick (Humphrey Bogart) and the pure and noble Victor (Paul Henried). Yet, Ilsa isn't the film's central character nor is the film from her perspective; Rick, the ""other man,"" ultimately controls everybody's destiny. In a broader sense, Ilsa is the world at large, torn between Victor and his resistance to Nazi aggression and Rick, an American defiantly striving to remain, if not neutral, at least isolated from the encroaching war. Rick's decision to ""stick his neck out"" is America's decision to enter the war. It is said that while filmming, no one knew just how it would end; in reality it couldn't end any other way and still be true to the American spirit. <br/><br/>One thing that repeated viewings reveal is just how well the film is acted. It has a notable cast of character actors from the era -- Sydney Greenstreet, Peter Lorre, etc. -- and the inimitable Claude Rains practically steals the film as Captain Renault, the cheerfully pragmatic ""poor corrupt official."" For Bogart, it was the pivotal role of his career, bridging his persona from tough guy roles to a more heroic image as a leading man. His Rick is an enigmatic character, who he plays with cynical restraint and the occasional flash of sly wit. Bergman's role is remarkably small, yet she plays Ilsa with cool intensity that borders on cunning. She shows Ilsa to be a woman who is use to being quiet, almost subservient, as a means of camouflage. Bergman does most of her acting with her eyes, studying other characters and reading their motives. And she is absolutely gorgeous throughout. <br/><br/>But perhaps the film remains so beloved, not because of the romance or its nationalism; but because it is quite funny. Humor in a film can be a sign that the material isn't being taken seriously, but when it is done this well, the opposite is true. Here wit defines the characters and reveals not just their attitudes, but their intelligence. A film that so easily could have fallen into the trap of easy patriotic platitudes instead uses humor to define cynicism and enhance conflict. More than just one-liners, the crisp dialogue defines the characters as intelligent and complicated individuals.<br/><br/>Though CASABLANCA remains a beloved film, I wonder just how much of that reverence is based on nostalgia; so much of what the film represents is passe, or at least politically incorrect. A submissive woman who begs a man to think for her would be declared an insult in our post-feminist society. Few believe in the nobility of war any more, regardless of the circumstances; and fewer still see the value of self-sacrifice. Maybe that is the secret of CASABLANCA: it isn't about who we are or who we once were, but about who we would really like to be."

Casablanca is really not much better that Gladiator (which was pretty bad).<br/><br/>
I wish people would stop believing that old movies are good. It's just something producers do to get you to buy movies. Not that all old movies are bad. On the Waterfront is a really good movie, but Casablanca is just another mediocre Curtz film. So stop pushing it at me."

","Noir: the word brings movies like this to mind, but where's the depth behind the fuss?  IMDB reviewers have this in the Top 10.  I suspect this has to do with a weepy end.  So much for thinking.<br/><br/>If I recall correctly, they tried colorizing this in the 80s and failed entirely because 'Casablanca' exists totally in Black and White.  Others that cannot be duplicated in color include 'Schindler's List', 'THEM!', 'Third Man', and 'King Kong'.  When placed in color, the tone is lost. Speaking as a photographer, I can easily say ""I love B&W"".<br/><br/>The lighting here is dynamic, even when Bogie is his bored with himself. Morgan Freeman has borrowed a lot from Bogie.  It's those shadows that make the film more than anything else.  There is competent editing here, but that doesn't help the simple script.  <br/><br/>Like 'Rambo', there is 'Casablanca' the movie and 'Casablanca' the phenomenon.  If you don't catch with the latter then you are stuck with the former.  If only the relationships had been less caricature, more detail, then it would be real learning material.<br/><br/>Final Analysis = = Midrange Material"

","I would say this is definitely a classic by all definitions but I also do not think it is a masterpiece by any means. I feel as if those who would call this movie ""the best"" are more likely older and have respect for writing, lighting, acting, story but that's it. The black and white is limiting but is utilized well to create stark contrast. Sam is such a fun character and Rick is one of the most subtly complex characters in any movie. It is an incredibly well made film but is definitely filled with a lot of dead-space and moves slowly at times."

","A ten score if there ever was one! It is difficult to say anything that hasn't already been said about this classic. Humphrey Bogart was in his early forties when CASABLANCA was made, but this kind of romance is ageless. Ingrid Bergman couldn't have been more attractive.<br/><br/>No man could have been more love smitten than Rick, and he finds solace in the bottle and the ballad, AS TIME GOES BY. This movie and that song are inseparably intertwined to many viewers.<br/><br/>Claude Rains heads a fine supporting cast. As Captain Renault, he walks a fine line between disrespect and reluctant obedience in dealing with the Nazis. His whimsy and humor are just a pleasure. Paul Henried is quite subdued in comparison.<br/><br/>Many of the one liners are well known. One of my favorites is, "" He's like all men, only more so."" Figure that one out. At the very end, ""This is the beginning of a beautiful friendship."" leaves you with a warm, positive feeling.<br/><br/>Oh, I have some trivial comments about CASABLANCA. Nobody is ever seen eating in the CAFE AMERICAINE. Perhaps all the action took place after 10 pm.<br/><br/>There never was a more desolate airport in the final scene. Only one airplane and not a single person around. Neither do Rick and the captain seem in any particular hurry in leaving, after Strasser was shot. Surely the Nazis would soon be in hot pursuit.<br/><br/>Do they make them like this anymore? I don't think so. This is one that no one should miss, young or old."

","In December 1941, American expatriate Rick Blaine is the proprietor of an upscale nightclub and gambling den in Casablanca. ""Rick's Café Américain"" attracts a varied clientele: Vichy French and German officials; refugees desperate to reach the still neutral United States; and those who prey on them. Although Rick professes to be neutral in all matters, it is later revealed he ran guns to Ethiopia during its war with Italy and fought on the Loyalist side in the Spanish Civil War.<br/><br/>Casablanca is a 1942 American romantic drama film directed by Michael Curtiz and based on Murray Burnett and Joan Alison's unproduced stage play Everybody Comes to Rick's. The film stars Humphrey Bogart, Ingrid Bergman, and Paul Henreid; it also features Claude Rains, Conrad Veidt, Sydney Greenstreet, Peter Lorre, and Dooley Wilson.

","This wartime romance is one that seems to consistently be referred to as a classic and one of the best Hollywood films ever. Whenever I watch it though, I can never really work out why. It's a good film, no doubt, but I can never truly get to grips with why it is so beloved. Whereas, the previous year's Citizen Kane is one whose excellence is very obvious, Casablanca seems more like a very well made yet conventional bit of cinema. Not that this is a bad thing of course.<br/><br/>It does have a pretty impressive cast though, that is one thing for sure. Humphrey Bogart as the cynical Rick and Ingrid Bergman as the woman, Ilsa, who changes him make for a memorable screen couple; while the support cast is even better, with Claude Rains, Peter Lorre and Conrad Veidt all at the top of their games in this one. The North African setting provides a nice exotic feel, while the World War II backdrop ensures that there is a definite menace underpinning everything. But this film is probably most famous for its romance, with a final few scenes that have become incredibly famous, with lines of dialogue that have been repeated and misquoted ever since.<br/><br/>A good film but I still don't really get the unadulterated love."
"dfiscaletti8","Null","2","4","12 October 2012"," Review for Casablanca
","Casablanca is a movie title that everyone has heard of and many talk about, so naturally I was excited to see it. Well yet again this ""classic"" let me down. I would not say it was a bad movie in anyway it just was not all that exciting or interesting. It seems to me that they focused on the something miniscule and the message the movie was portraying wasn't all that important, it was not until the very end when my attention was actually grabbed and I was enjoying the movie. I suppose because the movie didn't follow the traditional build up, climax, fall down set up it kind of threw me off. There were moments throughout the movie that grabbed me though, there was also a little bit of surprise here and there which I also enjoyed. Although the movie itself did not impress me that much, the art work within the movie was astonishing. Inside Rick's café it was beautifully decorated, especially in the scenes when looking down from the balcony stairs looking over all the guests and performers. The movie also played with shadows very well, casting the right mood and making everything look flawless. I wouldn't say the acting was amazing, actually I really didn't even like Humphrey Bogart . It may just have been his character, but I flat out didn't like him. Ingrid Bergman did an alright job, but once again nothing special. Just like the entire film, not impressive. The ending was another thing I found disappointing, I like love stories to have a happy ending, not a practical one."
"b_rannells","8","2","4","30 September 2012"," Of All the Gin Joints. . . She Had to Walk Into Mine
","The first thing that comes to mind when watching ""Casablanca"" is the elegance and simplicity allowing it to be a timeless classic. The movie has a peculiar magic to it, and it's in the richness of its details that the viewer finds them self engrossed. The director's use of foreshadowing makes those aha moments that come later on in the film even more exhilarating, and allow one to wonder if these events are happening within a 24 hour time frame. While it's fascinating to examine and dissect all that went into the making of Casablanca, the greatest pleasure anyone can achieve from this movie comes from simply watching it. <br/><br/>There are several events that occur throughout the film that allow us to make generalizations because these little peculiars add up. One of the many events that stick out in my mind is every time the plane to America flies overhead, the refugees look up, their faces longing for escape from Hitler's tyrant rule. We're reminded that old Hollywood was populated with those fleeing from Europe, and the creases in their faces say more than any studio narration used to set the scene. The use of facial expressions sets a common tone displayed throughout the movies. Another form of symbolism one can draw is that Rick represents the image of America during World War II. Rick did not want to get involved in other individuals business much like our war tactics during this time. Towards the end of the film he has no choice but to get involved and make sure Ilsa gets on that plane out of Casablanca, representing the protection of Pearl Harbor. Much like those refugees at the start of the picture, his life experience is written on his face throughout the film. The use of music also plays an important role in building emotion through the movie. Rick's saloon sets an atmosphere of paranoia, exoticism, and liveliness, and then comes romance, in the form of piano player Sam's rendition of ""It Had to Be You."" The paranoia is a result of those individuals trying to obtain traveling papers so they can flee the country, the exotic rush from gambling at this speakeasy which allows for liveliness during a time of despair. <br/><br/>The underlying message throughout the film is Rick's building relationship with Ilsa. The story takes place about a year after the Germans invaded France. Ilsa and her husband, Czech freedom fighter Victor Laszlo, wander into Rick's Cafe in Casablanca. Her husband's character feels more like an abstract idea rather than an image of freedom, unlike the letters of transit that allow people safe passage out of Casablanca which are concrete items. The two are on the run from the Nazis, and have come to the American-owned nightspot to lie low. But the German government is on the move, and Laszlo has to act quickly to get the letters of transit he came for, then escape. Little does Ilsa know that the café is run by Rick Blaine, the one true love of her life. When the two see each other, sparks fly, and memories of an enchanted time in Paris come flooding back. Through the use of flashbacks,we find out that Rick and Ilsa had a romantic experience in France and Ilsa leaves Rick with nothing but a broken heart and an extra train ticket. This draws us to conclude that this is a major struggle for Rick and may be the reason why he ""sticks his head out for nobody"". <br/><br/>It's not much of a stretch to say that Hollywood doesn't make movies like this any more because the bittersweet ending is almost uncommon in today's society. If Casablanca was produced today, Rick and Ilsa would escape on the plane after avoiding a hail of gunfire from the police. Who knows what would have happened to Victor Laszlo, but he wouldn't have gotten the girl. One of the things that makes Casablanca unique is the way it stays true to itself without giving into crowd-pleasing tactics. And because of this, not despite it, Casablanca has become known as one of the greatest movies ever made."

There were some funny one-liners throughout the script though. I can see how this is historically significant, due to its events set during World War 2, and the actual story being set in Nazi-Germany occupied Europe, which probably boosted this movies popularity.

"j-catanzaro","Null","2","4","13 October 2011"," Highly overrated
","Ugh. Top ten movie of all time? That is a joke. This movie belongs no where near the top 200. First off, this movie starts off slowly, very, very slowly. I felt as if all this dialogue and practical eventlessness in ""Rick's cafe' Americain"" would lead somewhere, but I was let down. Although I do not care much for this film, I will give credit where it is due. Casablanca relates to many with the story of Rick and his former lover meeting by chance after many years, only to stir up problems and confuse his feelings once again. The story itself is interesting, I just don't believe it was dramatic or eventful enough to keep anyone interested throughout. I wasn't really sure what this movie was aiming for, and that's just the problem. There were serious scenes that demanded my attention, there are bouts of comic relief (albeit not overly funny), there are suspenseful scenes, and there are flat out mixed up scenes where I had no idea what to think. This movie tries to be too many genres at once. If it was more focused I believe it may have made more sense. <br/><br/>OK- Just about the entire film is set in one single spot, that being Humphrey Bogart's Cafe, as I would venture to guess 80% or more of the footage you see is in one single building. YAWN. I actually fell asleep at TWO different points while watching this film. It is an absolute snorefest. The acting was good, the casting and script were nice, but there is just something missing from this movie that I cannot put my finger on. Overall it is very dull and dry, and I do not recommend it to anybody. I think it takes a solid 30 minutes before anything actually happens, and by that time we have already lost interest. Do not watch this film, do not recommend it to anyone, it will bore you to tears. Highly overrated, I cannot fathom how this film is considered an all-time great. It absolutely blows my mind. To sum up 'Casablanca' in one word---> YAWN."

","Casablanca is a persuasive pro-American film. It's fictional yet accurately portrays events that took place during world War II. The film has a large political influence, even Rick's character represents America's isolation from the war. The film is beautifully written and shot. Music plays a huge part in the film. It emphasizes the setting and feel of the film. As the mood of the characters change, so does the music. Even when the French sing their national anthem this adds so much to the film, and it becomes even more clear how passionate the French are about their country. The accents of the actors add to the mise-en scene, as well as the lighting in many of the scenes, such as the lighting in the restaurant, when everything is dim, the candles on the table are the only form of light, creating a certain mood. The movie is very fast paced, you can't look away for a moment or get out of your chair for a snack. There's always some new twist. Casablanca is a thrilling film to watch, and one that really lives up to it's expectations."

","I think you can judge a movie by how many times you watch it...I have watched Casablanca over 50 times! The characters, the location, the music and the story all come together perfectly to form a masterpiece that never grows tiring. This is a movie that definitely grows on you. The first time I watched it I was somewhat confused by the story but after a few more viewings I fell in love with the movie and all the personalities. Rick is a character that exudes leadership and it shows by how much his staff at Rick's respect and love him so very much. They seem so genuine and that feeling of love rubs off on you and suddenly you find yourself loving and respecting Rick as well. It's these types of emotions that make this movie so powerful. The music is another element of the movie that stirs up your emotions from the scene at Rick's where Laszlo is singing of the Marselliase and Yvonne's 'Vive La France!...just so very inspiring. You must see it for yourself...but please don't judge it on the first viewing...give it a few tries on a cold dark night and I promise you will fall in love with this movie."

As the movie went on I started to get lost and confused and couldn't really follow what was going on. I would defiantly want to watch the movie again because I think I would get more out of it. What I could follow was the love triangle that was going on, I thought that was interesting how Ilsa was running back and forth between then men. I thought the setting of the restaurant ""Casablanca"" was really pretty and I felt like I would want to go to that place. It had a really elegant feel to it with a little upbeat twist.

Humphrey Bogart brings his tough but cool persona, Ingrid Bergman brings an elegant but fragile charm, Claude Rains steals every scene he's in with his quick wit and impeccable comedic timing, Conrad Veidt plays the antagonist beautifully and menacingly, Sydney Greenstreet and Peter Lorre provide solid support in smaller roles that show off their shadier sides. The story is just perfect, its complicated so it requires constant attention but it moves by so fast and and never lets up that it is a real joy to watch. This film never has a dull moment, it will have you laughing in one scene and in the next it will have wrenched your heart out. Its shot in a romantic but noir type style that is impossible to take your eyes off of. The music is so moody and romantic it fits the music perfectly and it comes in at all the right moments, never taking away from a scene. The acting never goes over the top or anything, it just stays perfect. The person who I think sticks out the most and embodies the feel of this film would have to be Claude Rains. In one moment he can be so riotously funny and in the next he's as serious as he can be, just like the pace of the film. This really is the perfect movie and I strongly urge anyone who has not seen it to see it."

","Casablanca, according to AFI, is the 3rd greatest film, number 1 most passionate, and 37th most thrilling. Personally my favorite movie. Casablanca starts out with the death of two Germans carrying exit visas, the key for someone in Casablanca to go to Lisbon then the Americas. We then enter Rick's Cafe American, where most of the story takes place. Ugate(Lorre)told Rick(Bogart) about the two exit visas that were stolen and needed Rick to hold them for a few hours. Capt. Renault(Reins) speaks with Rick about the exit visas. He informs him about Victor Laszlo(Henreid) and his wife(Bergman) that they need to go to America to spread the news about Europe. Rick doesn't care until he meets and finds out that Laszlo's wife was Ilsa Lund, his lover in France that left him. Now, he must choose between his feelings, or the countless lives that hang in the balance. Casablanca carries such great performances such as Sydney Greenstreet, Dooley Wilson, Conrad Veidt, and many more. This movie went through some major trouble while being made with the script and it won an Oscar for best screenplay. Overall, movies like this aren't made anymore. It touches you forever. After you watch this film, it is just the beginning of a beautiful friendship as time goes by."
"Otoboke","Null","2","4","11 October 2008"," An experience you will never forget.
","'Casablanca' is one of those films that you may already know all about even if you haven't seen it. It is widely recognised from critics and movie lovers as being one of the greatest achievements made to date, and not without reason. Although I wouldn't name it as one of my favourite films of all time, there is no denying its brilliance, its mesmerising charm and influential impact it has had on cinema ever since.<br/><br/>Last night I was lucky enough to actually catch a special Valentines Day screening of the film at my local cinema, for what was my second time seeing the masterpiece. I have to say, I enjoyed the experience far more than my first, not just because of the quality of the restored version or that wonderful cinematic atmosphere you get when watching old classics, but because I believe 'Casablanca' is a film that gets better every time you watch it; You already know the characters and you already know the plot, and so the whole experience feels like a distant and personal memory that you share with the characters, something that ties in with the nostalgic tone of the film itself.<br/><br/>With its captivating photography, soundtrack and long segments of real-time shots, the film is one that engages the viewer and sucks them into its world. The whole experience to me was fantastically surreal; there were moments where I would be totally connected to the movie, where I actually felt like I was back in the 40's. Every now and then my attention would be broke by the usual toilet goers etc., and I would realise where I was and as I said; it was surreal. The reason I mention this however that is it is testament to how immersive 'Casablanca' really is.<br/><br/>Undoubtedly the two things that make the film what it is lie in the performances from the whole cast, and the absolutely solid script that was based on the early play ""Everybody Come to Ricks"". First of all, if watching the film for the first time, you will undoubtedly feel like you've seen it before, and this is no coincidence for you've probably heard a lot of the dialogue quoted elsewhere. Many people have claimed 'Casablanca' as having one of the most influential and well-written scripts in film history, and I would be inclined to agree. Throughout you'll bear witness to some of the most famous lines to be shown on the big screen, and also be treated to perhaps the greatest ending monologue ever written for film, which is just as eloquently delivered by Bogart himself. Then there's the absolutely wonderful use of hard-bitten dialogue throughout, mixed with its very classy equivalent, which provides for some intense scenes whether evoking humour, pity, anger or pride; 'Casablanca' manages to achieve it all.<br/><br/>I can't remember of the top of my head who once said this but whoever did was clearly getting at Michael Curtiz, under-appreciated director of 'Casablanca'. He said that the greatest directors blend into the fabric of their movies, never making their presence openly obvious; they make the rest of the crew look good. As time has gone on to prove, this is certainly the case here as Curtiz is a director who rarely gets mentioned when discussion on the movie is taking place. When watching the film for a second time however I kept this and mind, and noticed the superb amount of skill that did indeed go into making 'Casablanca' the masterpiece it is, and a lot of that comes down to Curtiz, who does a brilliant job bringing the entire production to life.<br/><br/>The people whom he really brings out however are the cast, who unquestionably give some of their greatest performances here, creating characters that are fully dimensional and likable without being submissive to conventional 'hero' stereotypes of the time. Bogart plays 'Rick', the owner of a saloon in Casablanca, outcast from his homeland, and a man with a broken heart, unwilling to 'stick his neck out for nobody' as a consequence. Throughout, Bogart performs expertly, showing his brilliant screen presence that he has become known for, letting his character flow through naturally and with constant emotion. Ingrid Bergman and Paul Henreid play 'Ilsa Lund' and 'Victor Laszlo' respectively, delivering equally emotive and powerful performances that only go to compliment Bogart and the rest of the cast magnificently, creating chemistry that never lets down.<br/><br/>I have deliberately avoided going into too much detail in this review merely on the basis that I feel I cannot and could not fully do this film justice by doing so. Instead I merely state what many others have done before me and advise that if you haven't done so already, be sure to watch 'Casablanca' as soon as you can; it's an experience you will never forget and you'll want to come back to again and again.<br/><br/><ul><li>A review by Jamie Robert Ward (http://www.invocus.net)</li></ul>"
"zardoz-13","10","2","4","15 June 2008"," ""Casablanca"" Deserves Cinematic Immortality!
","What can anybody say about this classic film that hasn't been said? Okay, it isn't my favorite World War II Warner Brothers film, but it is a grand movie. Yes, ""Casablanca"" is worth watching, and I've lost track of the number of times that I have seen this splendidly made black & white film. Undoubtedly, the Warner Brothers film Casablanca ranks as one of the most famous and most written about commercial films that the studio produced during World War II. Aljean Harmetz dedicated an entire book to this classic romantic melodrama, ""Round Up the Usual Suspects: The Making of Casablanca."" Her work is the seminal account about the production of the film. Ironically, according to Harmetz, MGM producer Sam Marx wanted to buy the unproduced play ""Everybody Comes to Rick's"" by Murray Burnett and Joan Allison, which was the basis of the movie, but MGM studio head Louis B. Mayer ""didn't think it was worth the money.""<br/><br/>Warner Brothers wound up buying the Burnett and Alison play for $20,000 on December 8, 1941. The studio assigned brothers Philip and Julius Epstein to write the script for this ""A"" budgeted picture, which they began on March 17, 1942. Howard Koch signed on later to rewrite their material.<br/><br/>The American Film Institute noted that the studio hired Robert Aisner as technical adviser, because he had ""served on the Maginot Line and escaped from a concentration camp by way of Casablanca."" According to Harmetz, Koch--not the Epstein brothers--provided the protagonist, Rick Blaine (Humphrey Bogart of ""High Sierra""), with the controversial background of running guns to Ethiopia. ""Casablanca"" concerns a saloonkeeper in Casablanca and Ilsa, the wife of Czech resistance leader Victor Lazlo trying to escape to Lisbon. A flashback revealed that Rick and Ilsa had met in Paris and fallen in love. When Hitler's troops entered the city, Rick waited for Ilsa at the train depot, but she did not join him. Instead, Sam, Rick's piano-playing friend, brings a note from Ilsa to Rick. In the note, Ilsa says that she loves him but cannot go with him. Rick is devastated. He and Sam escape from the Nazis, and Rick opens ""Rick's Café Americain,"" a bar and restaurant in Casablanca. The establishment has illicit gambling tables in the back. He befriends the womanizing Prefect of Police, Captain Renault (Claude Rains of ""Now, Voyager""), and lets him win at his roulette wheel. Rick's refusal to leave Casablanca when he could easily arrange his own departure puzzles the inquisitive Renault. Rick minds his own business. A rival café owner, Ferrari, who dabbles in the black market, chides him about such a shortsighted attitude. ""My dear Rick,"" Ferrari observes, ""when will you realize that in this world, today, isolationism is no longer a practical policy?"" In another scene with Renault, Rick replies when Renault cautions him about warning a man Renault plans to arrest with Rick's by now signature line of dialogue, ""I stick my neck out for nobody."" Renault congratulates him for his stance and confides in him that he has never arrested him because Rick does mind his own business. Meanwhile, thousands of refugees from war-torn Europe stream into Casablanca searching for some way to reach neutral Lisbon. Before people can leave French-ruled Morocco, they must show an exit visa signed by a French authority. A smalltime thief named Ugarte (Peter Lorre of ""M"") has slain two German couriers and stolen two letters of transit signed by General de Gaulle. Actually, the letters of transit served as a plot device that the Epstein brothers contributed to the screenplay. No such letters of transit existed in real life. Anyway, Ugarte entrusted the exit visas to Rick for safekeeping. In search of the visas, Ilsa (Ingrid Bergman of ""Spellbound"") and her husband, Victor Laszlo (Paul Henreid of ""Now, Voyager""), walk into Rick's bar. Ilsa recognizes Sam and persuades him to play an old tune ""As Time Goes By."" Reluctantly, Sam plays it, only to have an outraged Rick storm in and reprimand him for playing the song that he had ordered Sam never to play again. Ilsa intervenes, but Rick wants nothing to do with her, not after the way she deserted him in Paris. Rick is surprised when he learns from Ilsa that she had been married before they met, but she had believed at the time that her husband had died in a Nazi concentration camp. She explains that her spouse's surprise appearance prompted her to break her date with Rick. Ilsa tells Rick that Victor and she are desperate to reach Lisbon, but they lack exit visas. German Major Strasser threatens to arrest Victor. The resistance leader reminds him, ""You won't dare to interfere with me here. This is still unoccupied France."" Ilsa suspects that Rick has the letters of transit. Desperately, she threatens him with a gun, but knowing she could not shoot him, he ignores the gun. Later, Rick forces Renault to come to the airport where Ilsa and Victor appear. Forcing Renault to cooperate, Rick gives the letters of transit to Victor and Ilsa. At the last minute, Strasser appears at the airport and tries to detain Ilsa and Victor. Rick shoots Strasser. ""Well, Rick,"" Renault observes, ""you're not only a sentimentalist, but you've become a patriot."" He and Rick watch as the plane lifts off with Ilsa and Victor on board. The film ends as Renault and Rick walk off into the fog, and Rick says, ""Louis, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship."" Director Michael Curtiz never lets the action slacken. He stages everything with this customary efficiency. His use of shadows is good. The only flaw in ""Casablanca"" is the treatment of Sam. Spike Lee could rattle some cages over Sam's treatment. Rick sells the club without a word with Sam."

","This is simply the finest movie ever made. EVER. The plot is perfect. The cast is sublime. The ending is fantastic. The performances by Bogart and Bergman are their best work. There are so many classic lines still used 65 years later. Here's looking at you kid. We'll always have Paris. This may be the beginning of a great friendship. The problems of three little people don't amount to a hill of beans in this world. Play it Sam, play As Time Goes By. The evil German's are perfectly evil. The dueling national anthems are timeless. The corrupt French Captain is perfect in a corrupt nether world like war time Casablanca. The relationship between a young star struck Elsa in learning to love her underground hero husband. her pain at learning of his death. Her finding love in a new man - Bogey. And her distress at learning her husband was still alive and needed her. It all made up for the pain felt by Bogey at being left in the rain at the train station with her dear John letter dripping away. Perfection in plot, in casting, in shooting in black and white for effect. What more can be said. You can watch this movie every day and pick up something new each time you watch it."
"jem132","10","2","4","7 March 2008"," It just gets better with every new viewing!
","It is very apt that my 200th IMDb comment (I review classic films on here) should be for CASABLANCA, a film that is surely the most iconic of the Golden Age of Hollywood. So much has already been written and said about CASABLANCA that to add anything new would seem perfunctory (even this sentence sounds a little trite!), but I'll just add a few points in as to what makes this film so wonderful.<br/><br/>-Curtiz's direction. Understated, almost invisible and never intrusive, Mike Curtiz directed what seems like hundreds of Warner Brothers studio films without ever letting personal style intrude upon great story-telling. Curtiz was not a showy director, and CASABLANCA is hardly a showy film. Yet I can hardly think of any director who could have handled the final scene of the picture (the airport sequence) with such a fine sleight of hand. Bravo, Mr Curtiz.<br/><br/>-The script, with so many quotable lines. CASABLANCA's script is such a thing of perfection, even more astonishing when one learns that it was re-worked almost daily. Nearly every line (save Bogart's line to Henreid ""It seems that destiny has taken a hand""- it really does feel ""written"")is crisp; the screenplay is a mastery of the art of constructing film dialogue.<br/><br/>-It is still such a ""cool"" film. Bogart is perhaps the most ""cool"" of all classic film stars, and CASABLANCA still feels so fresh and modern, despite all the now-classic clichés.<br/><br/>-The duelling anthems scene is the highpoint of the picture, even more so than Bogart and Bergman's romantic scenes. It is truly an inspirational film moment, and has enormous power. Just one more reason to see the film.<br/><br/>-The supporting cast feel as if they haven't been cast in the film, they simply ""belong"" there. Even bit-characters like Yvonne are so perfectly cast and balanced with the protagonists. Rains is especially superb as Captain Renault, delivering many of the film's best lines.<br/><br/>-Of course, the romance between Bogart and Bergman...forever Rick and Ilsa. For lovers of romantic films, CASABLANCA is a doozy (and if you don't like romantic films, there is still much to admire here). I cannot fail to be drawn in by Bergman's ""Kiss me as if it were the last time"" of Bogie's ""Here's looking at you, kid"" every single time.<br/><br/>A film treasure."
"sddavis63","8","2","4","28 February 2008"," A Classic War Movie That Doesn't Seem Like A War Movie
","Having somehow never seen this classic movie, I was glad to have finally had the chance to watch it, and understand why it's seen as a classic. What I liked most about it was what it wasn't. Unlike most war movies that I've seen that were actually made during World War II, this has no battle scenes and no overtly patriotic binges (and what patriotism there is is French rather than American, which I found refreshing.) It comes across not as propaganda, but as a very human and very well done story about the struggles of living in Casablanca (governed by Vichy France) during the Second World War.<br/><br/>Humphrey Bogart seemed to me to be perfectly cast as Rick Blaine - the owner of an American cafe in Casablanca who for the most part tries to stay out of politics, although his contempt for the Germans clearly comes across in a variety of scenes. Ingrid Bergman also did a great job as Ilsa, a former love interest of Rick's who desperately needs Rick's help to escape to America with her husband (played by Paul Henreid) who is a leader of the anti-Nazi underground and has escaped from a Nazi concentration camp. Bogart and Bergman were great together; to be honest I thought Bergman and Henreid were less so, although what I sensed as the awkwardness between them may well have been a deliberate way of portraying Ilsa's confusion about her feelings for Rick. Claude Rains I thought did a great job playing Police Prefect Renault. He seemed to capture the dilemma of most officials of Vichy France - as he said himself, he blows ""with the wind, and for the moment the wind is blowing from Vichy."" His relationship with the Germans is deferential, and yet one gets the impression that basically, trapped in a tough situation, he's looking out for himself, which is probably what many Vichy officials did.<br/><br/>With a strong cast and a strong story featuring believable characters you end up with a very strong movie. It's interesting rather than exciting, and much better than most of the standard anti-Nazi patriotic binges that I've seen from the war years. (Having seen ""Casablanca"" I may now be inclined to watch some of Bogart's other war era movies.) 8/10"
"dead47548","10","2","4","8 January 2008"," Simply amazing.
","Possibly the most iconic picture in cinematic history. It's a film that doesn't rely on subtext and deep symbolism in order to impress the audience. This one is all about the story, and it's a magnificent one at that. Another picture that focuses on the lives of people who are indirectly involved in the war and how it changes them. Rick and Ilsa are two of the most complex and beautiful characters ever brought to film, in my opinion. Their romance is beautiful and the effect that leaving one another has on them is utterly tragic. Watching Rick brood while throwing back shot after shot the night after his first encounter with Ilsa in years is one of the most brutal and well acted scenes I've ever witnessed. He pours his heart and soul into the performance, as does Bergman, and everything about watching them is just sensational. You just know that you're watching magic. Their final moments together are some of the most shattering I've ever seen. It truly ripped my heart into a thousand pieces. Bergman delivers one of the greatest female performances I've ever seen, and Bogart is simply phenomenal as well."
"Robert_duder","8","2","4","2 January 2008"," 600 Reviews and now I am tackling what many consider the greatest film ever made
","I have never seen Casablanca until today. I had planned for some time that this would be my 600th review and I think it's very fitting. Is Casablanca truly the magnificent piece of cinematic history or does it simply have something that many classics are fortunate to have...cine-magic as I will call it. Some films just have this style, this charisma, the perfect balance of the something special that makes them endearing to millions and I think Casablanca is the perfect example of this. Furthermore Casablanca is often known as one of the 'greatest romance films of all time' but despite the romantic undertone the film is more of a World War II drama about patriotism and escaping the Nazi grip on the area. For its time, and the film certainly is timeless, but the gritty, dark setting sets a tone for danger and intrigue and mystery and even that romance. The characters are so sleek and have so much depth and you are just immediately enthralled with this story and this beautiful Casablanca world. The true brilliance of watching Casablanca now is feeling the classic aura. This film has SO many lines that are now truly pop culture history and so many moments that you will immediately recognize even if you've never seen it before.<br/><br/>This is my first Humphrey Bogart film and 'Bogie' is one incredible guy. He brings a whole new meaning to macho. Rick Blaine (Mr. Rick) is definitely a cinematic character you won't ever forget. He's rough and rugged and smart and has a deep history that unravels through the film and Bogart is terrific. He embodies the character and brings it right to the forefront of the film. From his drunken stupor as he cries for his lost love, to the final moments of saving lives he is amazing. Ingrid Bergman is beautiful yet her character is very subtle. She plays the mysterious and illusive Ilsa Lund. I can't say her performance is on par with Bogart's because her character is much more withdrawn and less bold but her magic performance comes from the fact that her and Bogart have incredible, unmistakable chemistry the likes of which you never see on screen anymore. For this reason no one else could replace her. Paul Henreid is also very good as the tough but decent Victor Laszlo. Henreid holds his own opposite Bogart, which is an impressive feat, and still creates a very impulsive and interesting character. Claude Rains also deserves mention as the menacing and self involved Nazi, Captain Renault.<br/><br/>Casablanca is the perfect example of the all the right ingredients lining up to create something completely magical. It would be hard to not have a brilliantly directed film like Casablanca with a director like Michael Curtiz who has no less than an astounding 170 plus films to his credit. Casablanca might be one of his most famous credits but for good reason. Casablanca isn't a perfect film...hence my lack of a 10/10 on it...or even a 9/10. I think some movie goers especially nowadays might find Casablanca slow paced, maybe even with some less than stellar dialog and it does reek of it's anti Nazi moral (not that there is a problem with that) but it definitely has that tone. The terrific romance that is always talked about is slowly unraveled and never really hits a climax but is more about romance in the past and love lost. Its actually more of a tragic romance and in that respect might turn romance fans off. Still the romance that once blossomed between Bogart and Bergman is still fiery and the story is sweet AND tragic. Regardless of how you look at it Casablanca stands the test of time and is something everyone must see at least once and I am glad to have seen it and will most definitely see it again. If nothing else you must watch the final scene on the air strip which is packed full of more classic lines and moments than any other part. Simply brilliant. 8.5/10"

"pyrocitor","10","2","4","8 November 2006"," Play it again, Sam
","One would be hard pressed to find a list of ""Best films ever made"" without Casablanca included on it - indeed, if any movie was to be singled out as the most laudable and classic picture of all time, there is no doubt that Casablanca would be right up there in the running, if not bestowed the title itself. But don't be scared off by thinking Casablanca has coasted by all these years on its hefty reputation - even now, more than 60 years down the road, this film stands the test of time as one of the most influential, inspiring, quotable and just plain well made creations Hollywood has ever come up with. <br/><br/>But one could go on all day listing different adjectives detailing Casablanca's classic status, so I'll try to bite them back and give a bit more of an analysis of the film. Director Michael Curtiz brings the film together with a touch which is daring, yet steady as a rock, presenting a powerful yet entertaining portrait of the days of Nazi occupied France, a message of hope shining through and the tumultuous love affair which grew in the midst of them - in short, the perfect period piece. <br/><br/>The cinematography is excellent for the time, sporting a simply beautiful, film noire sheen. The movie's high point (if one could be selected) is its wonderful screenplay, which is without a doubt, one of the single best of all time - both witty, bitingly political, classy, and filled with too many endlessly quoted lines to count. (""Here's looking at you kid"" ""I think this could be the beginning of a beautiful friendship"" and ""Of all the gin joints in all the towns in all the world, she had to walk into mine"" only being the tip of the iceberg) The endlessly referenced ending actually comes as surprising, but fits the tone of unrequited love perfectly, and shows how daring and unique this wonderful movie must have been in its time. <br/><br/>Humphrey Bogart is at his stoically iconic best here, creating a touching portrait of an infinitely complex and flawed man with layer upon layer of exquisitely written characterisation (""what's your nationality?"" ""I'm a drunkard"") to peel away. The beautiful Ingrid Bergman also gives a timeless performance as Bogart's mysterious past lover, and Paul Henreid makes a wonderful addition to the most classic love triangle of all time. The movie also manages to include several incredibly entertaining character roles, including the superb Claude Rains as a sympathetic police officer, Sydney Greenstreet as a corrupt club owner, and the deliciously creepy Peter Lorre in a far too brief supporting role. <br/><br/>Suffice to say, Casablanca is one of those films one can shamelessly say they have enjoyed time and time and time again - there are far too many subtle nuances to be caught and enjoyed in a single viewing, and the movie has a replay value next to none, making them easy to catch. Casablanca is billed as the most classic love story of all time, yes, but there is ultimately so much more to it than that. Safe to say, the term ""must see"" applies here if you have yet to do so, and if you are among those who have already experienced the classic, there's not the least bit of shame of wanting to play it again, and live the magic one more time. <br/><br/>-10/10"

It has something. Something like charm, thing that can't be produced by modern technology or cutting edge effects. Casablanca is a film that you will never want to end. The perfect example of Noir, every scene can be considered a separate piece of art. How actors move, what they say, how they say, everything is PERFECT.<br/><br/>And it was filmed more than 50 years ago. During war. Unthinkable.

","Casablanca is certainly one of the best and admired American films ever made. A subtle yet enthralling adventure set against the backdrop of World War II in Morrocco, it simultaneously plays as a romance film, an exotic intrigue film, and a wartime drama. However, the sum of it's parts produce a film that eludes straightforward classification.<br/><br/>Directed by the talented Hungarian director Michael Curtiz and shot almost entirely on studio sets, the film moves quickly through a surprisingly tightly constructed plot, in spite of the fact that the script was written each day as it was filmed and no one-not even the director-knew the ending. Curtiz debated up until the last day of filming who would use the two exit visas in order to escape. Apparently three weeks after the principal shooting ended, the producer Hal Wallis contributed the famous final line, and the last shot was taken on a fog-shrouded runway.<br/><br/>Casablanca is such a flawless film and a testament to the fundamentals of film-making, cinematic narrative, acting, directing, and editing, it is inconceivable that it could ever be remade."

There's something deeply human and personal about the story of Rick and Ilsa, and though even the most cynical viewer may be skeptical at first, one glance at Ingrid Bergman's downy and soulful eyes will dispel any doubts.

"SAMTHEBESTEST","9","0","0","3 May 2020"," Every time i watch Casablanca it leaves me SPEECHLESS !
","CASABLANCA (1942) :-<br/><br/>Every time i watch Casablanca, it leaves me speechless. This isn't the first time i am watching Casablanca and i am not reviewing it in typical manners i do for other films but this is just an appreciational essay and haters please stay away. There has been so much said about Casablanca for 7 decades but when someone like me as an young audience in 2020 says that this film always leaves me speechless, you know something is more than special about this film. I have seen so many classic films from Hollywood and recently i have been watching daily 2-3 films during lockdown. Then i just thought, let's watch Casablanca again to realise what other films are lacking, and somehow i am intended to write these words not to review Casablanca but just to appreciate it little more.<br/><br/>One thing i am sure about is, there will never be another Casablanca. For many reasons, Casablanca remains one and only of it's own kind. There were so many classics made on Love Story, Love Triangle, War, escape, Drama, Sacrifice and Emotions but none of them could make one perfect mixture of all them like Casablanca. The writing of Casablanca is a lesson for every writer who wishes to write an Intelligent film that will be remembered forever. The conflicts in Casablanca are summed up so cleverly. There is Love story, there is betrayal, there's Love Triangle, there's crime, there's Patriosm and then there is Mind Blowing climax that stayels with audience forever. I have always wanted to see at least one film that will use sentiments intelligently in the climax and my search ended with Casablanca. When everything seems like going Perfect in the film all you expect is a perfect Climax and Casablanca hits the best shot ever in those 15 minutes of Mind-blowing climax. It also taught some positive fellas that a sad, negative, intellectual and unparalleled ending works much better any typical happy ending. I don't think there will ever be any film which will beat those ""Intelligent Sentiments"" of Casablanca's Climax. And believe me nobody does it better than Humphrey Bogart.<br/><br/>I just can't imagine anyone else saying, ""We will always have Paris"", and ""Here's looking at you kid"" the way Bogart did. I am still trying to understand that why didn't he won Best Actor at Oscars for Casablanca? Ingrid Bergman's character Ilsa is another fine example of classic writing. While most of the films make the woman look weak and dumb under love theories, here comes Ilsa the as one of the most balanced woman character ever. Ingrid Bergman just doesn't look Gorgeous but she performs gorgeously which is more important. There are several other important characters in the film like Victor, Renault, Ferrari and Sam. These characters are also written with same conviction despite the fact that these have minimal parts to play but they do leave an strong impact.<br/><br/>Coming to the dialogues, Casablanca deserves one special seminar just to praise the Dialogues. I already mentioned two quotes from the climax but there are so many memorable quotes in the film. Even a small character like Sam went away saying one of the most honest and powerful dialogue, ""Please leave him alone Ilsa, you're a bad luck to him""<br/><br/>I don't remember Michael Curtiz's name for any other film except Casablanca. He might have been unaware of what he was going to achieve with Casablanca but my friend nothing can beat the glory of people knowing your name for that one Masterpiece you make in lifetime.<br/><br/>Films like Casablanca doesn't come often but when they come we must feel blessed. I was born in 90s, almost 5 decades after Casablanca but i still love this film more than any classic film of my era. The film has had an unmatchable impact over the years and i am sure it will continue having so even after completing 100 years. I am almost finished with most of Classics from 40s decade and there's no hesitation to say that, Casablanca is the Best film of 40s decade"". That's a big compliment when you know that it was the golden phase of Hollywood. If someday i catch a better film than Casablanca from 40s decade then I will surely let you know but for now this is it. A Masterpiece that changed typical mindset of Hollywood folks on Romantic Dramas, love trainglesa and noir (if i can say).

","As the protagonist of Casablanca, Rick runs an American coffee in Casablanca, the pearl of North Africa. It can also be said to be a bar. No one knows his past, no one knows why he came to Casablanca. Rick 's coffee shop became the main trading location for the Casablanca pass, and because of his management, police chief Renault turned a blind eye to it. It wasn't until the arrival of the leader of the Resistance Army Victor and his wife Ilsa that all this was broken, followed by the German major who was staring at him. When Ilsa stepped into Rick's cafe for the first time, all of their memories returned to Paris. The two people admired each other and loved each other. Rick's romance moved Ilsa, and Rick's silent support for the rebels also made Ilsa appreciate. But Ilsa has entrusted Victor with him for life. Soon, the Germans captured Paris and Rick decided to take Ilsa to Casablanca. At this time, Ilsa accidentally learned that Victor had escaped from the German concentration camp. The dilemma, she chose to leave Rick, leaving Rick to wait alone in the rain. Over time, Ilsa is still the former Ilsa, but Rick is no longer like the previous Rick. He looks cold and ruthless, bureaucratic, and profit-seeking, and because Ilsa's betrayal can not be relieved for a long time, this image of Rick undoubtedly makes Ilsa feel lost. But Rick actually didn't change at all. He first agreed to hide the exit certificates of the Victors for the arrested dealer Ugarte, and provided the money for the exit certificate for a couple who wanted to leave Casablanca to settle in New York. Director Renault 's gun forced him to let Victor and his wife leave the country, and at the airport Ilsa expressed Rick 's willingness to stay in Casablanca with him for the rest of his life. The German major who was going to block was sent to Xitian, and he left Casablanca with the tacit consent of the police chief. In the troubled times, Rick loves Ilsa so persistently. At the Paris station, he continues to wait even if he is soaked. Even if he thinks that he is hurt by Ilsa, he still wants to listen to her explain the matter. Under the cold mask, Rick is willing to pay any price for the beloved person and career, and is also willing to accomplish the career and love of others. Pleasant bureaucracy has become his amulet in troubled times. Rick is clever and hides his enthusiasm with coldness. He insists on pursuing love but is tolerant to his lover who hurt himself in the past. Rick has no handsome appearance, but his charm is infinite. As Renault said, no woman will fall in love with Rick. Maybe the highest state of being is like Rick"

","Every time I watch this, my estimation of it grows and grows. The story, of love found and lost and then found again, of choosing principle over expediency, of deciding what really matters, is timeless. The performances are top notch, aided by the fact that many of the actors were actual refugees from the Nazis. I think of the look of hatred and pain on Bogart's face when he sees Ilsa again for the first time, of his look of loss at the train station, of his look of nobility when he tells her that the ""good fight"" is worth what they have to give up as he says ""here's looking at you, kid"". A bittersweet romantic outcome for the ages. I think of how luminous Ingrid looks, and how expressive her eyes are as she experiences love, pain, sorrow, joy, and regret. Great, crackling dialogue. It amazes me that the script was essentially written on the fly, and they didn't even decide until late how it would all turn out. One of the all time great films."

"renegadeviking-271-528568","9","0","0","16 February 2020"," Casablanca review
","Let me be frank: I love Casablanca, the film directed by Michael Curtiz and released in 1942 starring Humphrey Bogart, Ingrid Bergman and Paul Henreid. I've seen it multiple times, and each time the ending makes me cry and I find all its plot twists still exciting. Everything is amazing: its fervent anti-Nazism, the perfectly constructed sets in the Warner Bros. Studios, the memorable soundtrack, the acting, the black and white cinematography... everything! So be aware that my review is based on my enthusiastic opinion of the movie.<br/><br/>Let's start from an introduction to the plot. Casablanca is part of unoccupied France and, although it's ruled by the Vichy government, it's the destination of many who want to flee the seemingly unstoppable Nazis. Rick (Humphrey Bogart) is an American who runs one of the busiest bars in town employing people of different nationalities including the talented African-American pianist Sam (Dooley Williams). Rick is a man without ideals who only cares for himself, as we understand from his conversations with Louis Renault (Claude Rains), the corrupt French soldier who rules the city. One night Rick comes into possession of two precious passes (stolen from an Italian called Ugarte and played by Slovak actor Peter Lorre: in 1940s' Hollywood they didn't know much about Italy). The passes could allow anyone to get to Lisbon and from there to reach safe-heaven in the United States. Shortly thereafter, the Czechoslovak refugee Victor Laszlo (Paul Henreid) and his wife Ilsa Lund (Ingrid Bergman) arrive right at Rick's in need of these passes. Will they get them? And what to do with Major Strasser (Conrad Veidt), the Third Reich representative who keeps Renault on a leash like a puppy?<br/><br/>I don't want to write anything else about the plot. If you haven't seen the movie, be aware that the plot is anything but trivial and it's interesting from beginning to end. Despite being a film made almost 80 years ago, it is still incredibly fresh and it's worth watching without a shadow of a doubt. As I wrote in the beginning, everything works beautifully, including the story. I also find amusing how us Italians are treated: servants who go completely unnoticed (the military at the airport waiting for Strasser), mafia-related (Ferrari is the head of the underworld of Casablanca), and criminals (Ugarte). That's it, thank you! On the other hand, in 1942 Italy was ruled by a fascist dictator, so it seems to me that the least we could expect was to be treated well overseas! In fact, this is a very political film, which is not surprising given that it was produced by Warner who at the time was openly anti-Nazi. The film was given the green light two weeks after the attack on Pearl Harbor!<br/><br/>And coming back to the film itself, how many unforgettable dialogues! ""Play it, Sam"", ""We'll always have Paris"", ""Here's looking at you, kid"", and ""This is the beginning of a beautiful friendship"" not only are spoken in the movie, but have been reused everywhere in homage to Curtiz's masterpiece. And how many unforgettable scenes! La Marseillaise sung loudly to silence the hideous Nazis in the bar (although it must be said that this particular scene was copied from a similar one in the movie The Great Illusion, La Grande Illusion, 1937), the ending in the foggy airport, As Time Goes By sung by Sam a few times, the flashback in Paris with Rick and Ilsa...<br/><br/>Ingrid Bergman is really beautiful in this film, and she has great chemistry with Humphrey Bogart. Apparently, and surprisingly, none of the main actors involved in the film believed particularly in the project... But it is well-known that anecdotes about films dating back to the first half of last century are not particularly reliable! Casablanca is a beautiful black and white film shot with spectacular sets, legendary actors and actresses, and its messages on freedom and on the need to fight fascism are still powerful and, unfortunately, very relevant today. Ciao!"

That being said, he does it very well, and it is still endearing to watch (although these movies have to be spaced out by other movies otherwise it really does become soul-sucking.""

","What can you say that hasn't been said before.<br/><br/>There are a few films that have a lot of sycophants that talk rubbish about so called top films when they are nothing of the sort, this is not one of those films.<br/><br/>I am not a fan of Romantic Drama's but this is not a run of the mill film, this is Casablanca, probably the best Romantic Drama ever.<br/><br/>Humphrey Bogart is excellent, as is Ingrid Bergman and the rest are good as well, Conrad Veidt was good as the nasty German, it was directed well and excellent dialogue, photography is poor though, but that is the nature of the times and type of film, music is spot on.<br/><br/>It is not perfect though, the dialogue is a bit too sharp early in the film and there are several scenes where people order drinks and leave either before receiving them or after only 1 sip, so that was a bit forced, but it relaxed a bit later on, like as if the characters were getting used to each other, but the slow build works up to an excellent ending, the photography is a bit dark and it would have been nice if Peter Lorre stayed in the film a little longer, I think they could have lengthened the movie to 2hrs from the 1hr 45mins it is, and it would have been better.<br/><br/>Nevertheless it is still a great film, worth the plaudits and its place in movie history.<br/><br/>Bogart did say ""Here's Looking at You Kid"" a few times, and the "".....not worth a hill of beans...."" sentence, but never said ""Play it again Sam"", however he did say ""Play it Sam, You played it for her so you can play it for me""<br/><br/>Sam you can play this again and again."
"davidmvining","10","0","0","21 November 2019"," One of the greatest studio films
","Out of all the movies in my top ten, this is probably the one that pops up most in others. It's been a staple of American cinema pretty much since its release and when it won the Oscar for Best Picture of 1942. It's well loved by nearly everyone who sees it, and I think it's easy to see why.<br/><br/>In my mind there are two major reasons why both I love this film and why it's so beloved 76 years after its release: dialogue and the expert mixture of cynicism with romanticism.<br/><br/>First Things First<br/><br/>The movie nominally takes place in the city of Casablanca during World War II, but it's a version that seems fairly divorced from reality. The central plot device in the movie are a pair of letters of transit signed by Charles de Gaulle that will allow anyone carrying them to leave the city on the plane for Lisbon where they'll be able to find a way to America. The letters of transit were a complete fabrication of the writers of the original stage play that the movie was based off of.<br/><br/>The movie's larger geopolitical picture is, quite simply, a fantasy. It makes a certain amount of sense that the wildly corrupt Free French prefect would allow almost anything to happen in the city as long as he got his cut, but the Nazi presence feels almost benign compared to what one might expect from what a Nazi would actually do with that kind of presence in a city and confronted with possibly losing a high priority target like Victor Laszlo.<br/><br/>But, that's not the point. Casablanca isn't about World War II, the political realities of the war, or even the relationship Free France had with Nazi Germany. No, the movie is about two people, and those around them that affect their relationship.<br/><br/>Dialogue<br/><br/>That being said, I'm hoping we all know the story of Casablanca, so I'm going to skip a plot summary. Instead, I'm going to dive into the qualities that have helped the movie last so long.<br/><br/>Apparently, the cast thought the dialogue was silly and unnatural as they filmed it. One thing's for sure, no one speaks with this much wit in real life.<br/><br/>The script for Casablanca is the sort of high-octane, clever, dialogue driven script no one really writes anymore. Diablo Cody was in the same league with Juno a while ago, but audiences seem to want naturalistic dialogue in most circumstances. They'll allow some room for things like period pieces, but overall there's an insistence that everyone talk like they would in real life.<br/><br/>Which is a shame, although if everyone had the kind of constant one-liners that Rick, Ilsa, and Renault life could be significantly more fun.<br/><br/>The movie is well-known for its great exchanges, having six quotes in the AFI's list ""100 Years...100 Quotes"", more than any other movie in the list. There's the simple stuff like ""Here's looking at you, kid,"" (an invention of Humphrey Bogart as he taught Ingrid Bergman English on set), but Claude Rains' Renault has all of my favorites. Out of context, the ""shocked"" line is funny for the pure absurdity of it, but in context it's even funnier.<br/><br/>I also love Renault's response to Rick threatening to shoot him in the heart as his least vulnerable spot. The movie is stuffed full of this fantastic sort of stuff that makes just listening to the dialogue a pleasure on its own outside of any other parts of the film.
Cynicism vs. Romanticism<br/><br/>I think this is really why the movie endures through the decades. It portrays a rather complex portrait of balancing the cynicism brought upon by loss and melancholy with the need for Romanticism in the world.<br/><br/>Rick starts the film as, what looks like, a pure cynic. He doesn't talk about his past and seems only concerned with keeping his bar open in such a tumultuous city with such a (poor) corrupt official in Renault. In the opening act, though, we see signs that there's more to him than that. Renault talks about some of Rick's past. He participated in two smaller wars by running guns, and in both the side he chose lost. The implication is that Rick was a romantic, but his behavior in the scene is designed to make it look like he's left it all behind. He says, ""I stick my neck out for nobody,"" twice in the first twenty minutes.
All things considered, he probably would have continued on this path with the kind of behavior that leads him to idly stand by as a man he's friendly with is rounded up and taken away to surely be shot, but the source of his cynicism arrives. Ilsa (Ingrid Bergman) arrives in Rick's place and Rick immediately begins to change. He drinks with customers (which he never does), he helps a young Bulgarian couple win at his own roulette tables so the young woman won't have to sell her body to Renault for the help they need to leave Casablanca.<br/><br/>Eventually, it all culminates in that side of Rick, that he has tried to suppress for years since Ilsa left him to return to her presumed dead husband Victor Laszlo, completely taking over. He removes himself from his shell and becomes completely selfless. Instead of using the letters of transit for himself, he gives them to Laszlo.<br/><br/>This move could mean one of two things, both related. It could mean that Rick has become a patriot, as Renault calls him, and is now fighting for a cause much like he used to, but it could also mean that he simply knew that Ilsa would never be happy with Rick if she knew that Laszlo was dead. He'd have her, but he'd be the architect of her husband's death. There couldn't be any love there, so he does what's right and walks away. The yearning to be a better man amidst a hostile world is appealing to many people.<br/><br/>Casablanca 2: Electric Bugaloo<br/><br/>Let me take a moment to talk about the very end of the movie. Ilsa and Laszlo have flown away. Rick has shot the main  character. Renault has covered for Rick's actions, and the pair walk off into the fog, beginning a beautiful friendship. I don't want to be the ""get off my lawn"" cynic, but if that got made today there'd be work on a sequel before the movie opened, just in case it was successful. That sequel would possibly put Renault as the main character because he'd test really well in screenings, and Rick and Ilsa would end up together.
It wouldn't destroy the original, but it'd spit on it.<br/><br/>The beauty of that ending is that it allows us to imagine what could be, but also it ends that part of Rick's story at the exact right moment. He's completely changed from cynic to romantic, and we don't need to see anymore.
Warners wanted a sequel immediately after release (called Brazzaville), but they never made it. Also, can you believe that Madonna tried to remake it once? Ashton Kutcher would have been Rick. At least studio executives have one movie they refuse to try and remake, at least for now.<br/><br/>The Studio System<br/><br/>The making of the movie, which seems to wonderfully designed and assembled, was apparently a mess. Aside from the aforementioned distaste the actors had for the dialogue, there is the famous story of Humphrey Bogart being called to set to stand in a place and nod, for a reason he had no idea. It ended up being Rick telling the band to play the Marseilles. There were also rumors of multiple endings for a while that are largely untrue (although this joke from The Simpsons always puts a smile on my face), but there was an attempt to extend the ending with shots of Rick and Renault on an Allied ship invading North Africa (ugh, just try to ruin everything why don't you). I'm glad Claude Rains was apparently unavailable.<br/><br/>But, it was a studio picture and probably the best example of what the studio system did well. They had contract players they just pulled into pictures they thought would fit, hired directors who were technically competent and unflashy, and writers who could churn out quality work. When this system came together well, it ended up creating absolutely wonderful entertainments. It's not how every movie should be made, but it could work very, very well."

Casablanca is a classic love story dealing with war ad violence as well. This film was truly phenomenal and engaging throughout its entirety. The story was good because it was compelling the entire time. Bogart was amazing in this movie as well. Overall this movie is highly recommended."

","I know the clichÃ©s always fly fast and furious when this film is mentioned but I think it deserves all the praise and attention it receives.<br/><br/>One of the things that I think makes Casablanca so special is when it came out - while World War II was still being fought and the Allies could have lost. To me that gives it more emotional appeal than the many many post-war films that depicted anti-Nazi heroics once it was safe to do so.<br/><br/>I realize all fans of this film have their own favorite lines but one that always sticks out for me is when Victor welcomes Rick ""Fought in Ethiopia and the Spanish Civil War"" Blaine back to the fight and reassures him that ""This time I know our side will win."""

","Casablanca, is not my favorite movie. Though in many ways it is a very well rounded movie. Ingrid Bergman is a beautiful women, that plays Ilsa and she falls in love with Rick ( Humphrey Bogart). During this movie you see a man and women in Casablanca, that can not get out unless they have a visa. Well they end up going through a lot of things, and encountering many problems as the movie goes. I know that the movie ends sadly, but the movie would not have been the same I think if it did not end the way it did. I particularly do not like this movie, because it felt very drawn out, and the plot was not too entertaining to me. I enjoyed the facial expressions that they have, its kind of funny because most of the time if you don't listen you can still kind of interpret what they are talking about. I do not know many movies that deal with this type of thing. The visa's and the war and such, but I do know that for what this movie was about it was well done. The music they have with it, goes along with all of the scenes plus I like the fact that for an older movie that they have live singers in it. The music is fast in tense moments, and slow in romantic moments. This movie has romance, war, some comedy, sadness, and in a way worth while watching. I have seen this movie a few times, and I can still say that each time I watch it I remember pretty much almost everything that happens in this movie for a while."

","""Casablanca"" is everyone's favorite film when they say 'Of course, it's not a great work of cinema, but...' No, it is not, but it is a great textbook on how to make a film that is successful from one medium to another: stage to screen.<br/><br/>The camera is so fluid that we do not realize that for most of the action we are in one set. The cutting is good and unobtrusive. We are watching a play with two cafes, an airport tarmac and some flashbacks. At no time do we feel claustrophobic.<br/><br/>This film, this movie is not really about WWII or its love story or even North Africa but it is definitely about Hollywood and the refugees who came to act and live there from Europe, along with the Americans who were already there and how the studio system worked. Some of the actors played major roles in great works of film abroad by major cinema artists and now are reduced to medium featured or small but telling supporting roles, and others, like Bogart, fought their way up through a series of type casting roles to become major actors and icons of American culture: the commentator on American life. Ingrid Bergman is enigmatic and opaque; we know no more about her at the end than at the beginning but we do know considerably more about Humphrey Bogart. She is Continental Europe and he is America. Claude Rains, as the Englishman,playing a Frenchman, is the mediator between the two countries and has some of the best movie lines of his career. Paul Henried, as the almost unbelievably understanding and detached underground resistance hero is not so much a person but an emotion, the voice of the oppressed and is also enigmatic. Many, many actors of the period can be seen in quick flashes; the film is great fun to watch.<br/><br/>And is also very well written with some memorable dialogue. Howard Koch was to write a book with a similar theme, the clash of cultures and getting out of a tight place on the verge of exploding that was made into an excellent film in 1984, ""The Year of Living Dangerously"",by Peter Wier, about journalists waiting it out in the Far East.<br/><br/>For a picture of Hollywood and the United States during WWII as filtered through for the running time of the film, a part of America stands still for its portrait in ""Casablanca."""

","Whoever discovered Humphrey Bogart as an actor, was a genius; someone that noticed a great talent and persona when they saw it. If Bogart hadn't been introduced into the movie business, one of the greatest love stories ever filmed couldn't have been possible. Without Bogart, Casablanca as a whole, probably would have failed. 	 This is a movie for big love story fans, (which this reviewer is not.) A finely crafted plot with all the little bumps along the way, which modern audiences have become accustomed to. With a cohesive cast including the stunning Ingrid Bergman and the man himself, Humphrey Bogart, Casablanca makes a very believable romance out of the era's biggest stars. An original mold for the all too familiar `love triangle'. 	 Even though Bogart is the main star of the movie, he doesn't quite steal the picture. There are numerous other great performances, like that of Claude Rains as Capt. Louis Renault, and the slightly eerie portrayal of Ugarte, by the fantastic Peter Lorre. The direction isn't astounding, but it does well not to distract the viewer from the great story. Who really needs fancy camera tricks if you have some of the best actors and a really enthralling story? 	 Perhaps ranked a little too highly by critics, (AFI #2) Casablanca is still the original love story. It has been copied by many imitators for its tension, legendary wit and quotable quotes. Not the greatest American movie ever made, but is has been very influential upon the genre and on countless other films since. A must see for any film buff.<br/><br/>

","The writers of Casablanca put the history into the movie which I found was unique, because how many writers do that today? Not many. One thing the writers could have done was show more of the history instead of talking about it. The war shoots were incredible because they looked like real war footage. Rick (Humphrey Bogart) was a young man who ran away from the law and government once in America and wasn't afraid to loose all of his money and/or his life in Casablanca. Rick (Bogart) plays a big role in the movie, in a way he was a symbol, a symbol of freedom. The Captain Renault (Claude Rains) also is a symbol, he is a symbol of command and conquer, meaning he can control every one and everything. In Casablanca his role is an officer that make women sleep with him in order to allow them out of Casablanca. He even broke couples, and husband and wives break up because he would only give them one visa allowing only one of them to go. By him doing that caused a great love to come and then go which comes to bite Rick (Bogart) butt, So Rick (Bogart) prevents it from happening again to the newlyweds. Rick (Bogart) was a softy and now wanted what was once his, by setting him up and ends up helping in the end. The last scene was also a symbol because one, the part where Captain Renault (Rains) was going to drink water that had a label that said `VISHI' which means it was French, and he throws it away showing Rick (Bogart) that he is a freedom fighter. Another symbol part was when his ex-lover Ilsa Laszlo (Ingrid Bergman) and her husband Victor Laszlo (Paul Henreid) walk into the darky fog, this means that she is out of Rick's (Bogart) life forever, And the finally symbol part was when the Captain Renault (Rains) and Rick (Bogart) walk into the fog saying one of the many famous lines ` this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship'. Other noticeable famous line is `here's looking at you kid'."

Now the sad thing is people here are cheap. Any minute they can get taken away and found guilty of a bogus crime. Well, what is there left to do? Go to Rick's All-American Night Club. Though trouble is brewing as Rick (Humphrey Bogart) runs into an old love Ilsa (Ingrid Bergman), with many others plot spins thrown into the mix.<br/><br/>At the time this film came out it was current events. Well, sort of cause after it was released into theaters the Germans invaded Casablanca. Rick's bar was quite a novel place surrounded by crazy foreign stuff. Funny how most people want to go to Rick's as opposed to any of the other bars? This is sue to the fact of `anything American' is the best thing in the world. Take for example McDonalds; since they have gone overseas people treat the store as a high ritzy spot. <br/><br/>Rick's past is sort of a mystery. He was kicked out of the U.S., lived in France, and is now in Casablanca. He doesn't stick his neck out for anyone, but things start to change as his old mistress comes to Casablanca with her husband Laszlo (Paul Henreid) trying to escape to the U.S.<br/><br/>This is a love story that came out shortly after radio stations were regularly broadcasting. Which means there was more put into the dialogue than in the effects. It did not take away from the experience, but recent generations will most likely find this style too out dated.<br/><br/>Recommendations: Yes to people who know how to enjoy a real movie, and not something like `the Fast and the Furious.'"

","Casablanca is extremely realistic in that it is the only movie I have ever seen that portrays the true hierarchy of values. All important existential problems are more or less depicted. Casablanca is a genuine art performance.<br/><br/>The plot spans history, love, human condition, existentialism, problems of meaning. Romance in the plot is the common denominator in the sense that it appeals to everyone's emotional memories. The purpose of this stratagem is that of perpetrating a deep channel into everyone's heart so that larger issues can be approached from a human, more delicate perspective.<br/><br/>In the end, romance is discarded. Rationality wins over love. Rick sees through Ilsa's cunning scheme. I found Rick's final explanation the most emotionally loaded part. He and Laszlo behave like two firmly grounded men and no offense is taken. This is hugely symbolic-laden because Ilsa is reduced to her romantic affair. Nothing more.<br/><br/>Casablanca is solid as a rock. There are no useless shots. Procrust's bed is a concept very well handled by directors. Sadly, in only one direction. Casablanca is the opposite around. Too many things had to be said in such a short time to let sequences extend more than needed. Action flows, hints are everywhere, the people behind the movie did not want to play with your patience. You can actually go along the movie.<br/><br/>Would you believe that the classic love story AND the propaganda behind Casablanca do not impede with it?

","There is very little doubt, except from some of the younger people who have not seen much  and to them the first Star Wars film is almost ancient history that feel Casablanca is perhaps the greatest film ever made, bar none. It is that good and that great. It could be viewed as probably the most perfect movie ever made. The direction, the acting, the script, the casting, the setting, and the way things were shot is without a doubt, of the highest calibre ever made. You have great direction, great casting with even the smallest roles played by the actors to perfection. Every character is there for a reason and adds to the film even in the smallest capacity. Bogart's Rick is the perfect anti-hero as is Bergman as the woman he still loves and lost. The love story is timeless, worldly and yet surprisingly fresh. Some movies age with time, Casablanca only gets better  and more timeless, like fine wine. There can be a debate about which film is the greatest. Some may view Citizen Kane or Gone With the Wind as having the top spot and that is fine, both are worthy films and belong in the top ten. But in my humble opinion, Casablanca is the best simple because it is the perfect movie. It has stood the test of time and is the Greatest of the all-time Great films! There has been and will be nothing made that can compare to it. Casablanca is simply the greatest film ever made!"
"cariart","Null","0","0","25 August 2003"," A Classic, Never Out-of-Date!
","So much has been written about CASABLANCA that you can get the uneasy feeling that any comment you make about the film has been made before, and better! It is the most cherished classic in film history, number two on the AFI list of the '100 Greatest Films of All Time' (only CITIZEN KANE, arguably the most influential film ever made, topped it); it's leading man, Humphrey Bogart, has been declared by the AFI as the 'Greatest Star of All Time', and 'Rick Blaine' was Bogie's greatest role; it has more phrases that have become part of our lexicon than any other film (""Round up the usual suspects"", ""Here's looking at you, kid"", ""We'll always have Paris"", ""I stick my neck out for nobody"", and the erroneous but immortal phrase, ""Play it again, Sam"" are just a few); it has influenced pop culture for three generations, making fedoras and trench coats (and, unfortunately, cigarettes) essential elements of 'cool'. CASABLANCA is the definitive film about sacrificing for the 'greater good', with characters who are clearly flawed, yet find redemption and a higher purpose. Oh, and it is maybe the best romance ever made, to boot, without resorting to 'R' rated dialog or nude love scenes (a lesson sadly lost on film makers, today!)<br/><br/>Despite paying a record sum for the unproduced play (""Everybody Comes to Rick's"") that became CASABLANCA, the production itself was considered routine, just another of the 50 or so films the WB produced each year. Despite the presence of Ingrid Bergman (on loan from David O. Selznick) and Paul Henreid (from RKO), there was no finished script at the time of the shooting, and the cast would often not know what their lines would be until the cameras were about to roll. While this gave the film a kind of edginess that 'worked', it drove everyone crazy, particularly Bergman, who was anxious to finish and move on to the film she expected to be her 'classic', FOR WHOM THE BELL TOLLS, with Gary Cooper. (CASABLANCA's ultimate place in film history, far greater than the Hemingway adaptation's, always stunned the actress!) Certainly, as filming 'wrapped', and Bogie returned to the sound stage for a last time, to record an added line, written by producer Hal Wallis to provide a warm, wry coda to the film (""Louis, this could be the start of a beautiful friendship""), all the participants moved on to their next jobs, unaware of what had been achieved.<br/><br/>Some films are born great; some are 'touched by the Gods', with the elements that created them combining with the timing of the release to make them 'classic'. CASABLANCA was such a film. When the finished production was assembled, the Epstein brothers' brilliant dialog (written, often, at the last moment) blended perfectly with Howard Koch's dramatic and Casey Robinson's romantic script elements. Under the sure hand of director Michael Curtiz, with a wildly romantic Max Steiner score, and Dooley Wilson singing 'As Time Goes By', the WB knew it had a hit...then, as the film was released, the invasion of North Africa began, and suddenly the word ""Casablanca"" was on EVERYONE'S lips! CASABLANCA went from being just a 'hit', to being THE film of 1942. That it won the Oscar for 'Best Picture' surprised no one; what surprised everyone was the fact that film gained in luster and popularity with each passing year, winning whole new generations of fans with it's timeless tale, and charismatic leading man. As John Huston told an interviewer, in the 60s, ""Bogie is more popular today than he ever was"", and the same can be said of CASABLANCA, today.<br/><br/>To borrow a quote from HIGHLANDER, ""In the end, there can be only one""...to film lovers, around the world, CASABLANCA is the one!"

","!! SPOILER !! <br/><br/>Without doubt a work of genius. Full marks, 10 out of 10. When this film appeared in 1942 Bogart was yet the great Star he was to become. During the 30s he had regularly featured in Warner Bros. gangster films as a typical hoodlum; all churned out on the WB assembly line with little of interest in them. His reputation at the time was on a par with that of the dependable B-movie actor Lloyd Nolan, perhaps even lower. However, recently he had been cast in The Maltese Falcon where he had displayed a previously unknown potential; Casablanca, in retrospect, transformed his career for him. It also enhanced that of Ingrid Bergman. Others on this website have said much in praise of this film which screams out for its missing sequel (did Hollywood fear a flop so they shied away from it?) a prequel would not come amiss either. So many things are unexplained in the story that there is ample material for further development. Was it coincidence that the man who showed Laszlo the Cross of Lorraine ring, Berger, and Ilsa were both Norwegian? Why does Laszlo, the great underground leader want to go to America at a time, 1941, when all external resistance movements are centred in London? Signor Ferrari is a very mysterious character, is there something more to him than just a clever black marketeer and owner of the Blue Parrot bar? What really took place between Ilsa and her lost lover Richard on that last night together? What happened to Ilsa and Laszlo after they left for America? Did she and Richard ever meet again? Why was the attitude of Laszlo towards her so cold? What was the powerful force that tore the recently reunited lovers apart when they could easily have stayed together? As for a prequel, there are the untold stories of Ilsa and Laszlo, Ilsa and Richard (briefly related in the film) and Laszlo himself.<br/><br/>Here is how I see the story continuing. After Ilsa and Laszlo depart on the plane, Berger goes to Ferrari who turns out to be a British agent and the contact man for all agents operating from London in the region. Berger identifies himself as a Norwegian resistance member sent out from London and requests help in getting back urgently. He gives Ferrari a brief coded message for radioing to London. Ferrari promptly sends this off and routinely adds the information that Ilsa and Laszlo are en route for Lisbon. He also requests that Rick and Captain Louis Renault, who have gone into hiding, should accompany Berger as they are in mortal danger from the Nazis who are seeking revenge for the killing of Major Strasser. The next night a small boat takes the three men out to sea where they rendezvous with a Royal Navy warship which carries them safely to England.<br/><br/>After arriving in Lisbon, Ilsa and Laszlo go to the American embassy to get the required travel documents and are whisked into the office of the ambassador who tells them that he has been urgently informed by the American ambassador in London that Laszlo has been requested to fly to London by the next plane to participate in a top secret high level conference of senior resistance leaders. However when the couple reach the Norwegian resistance HQ in London, Ilsa promptly denounces Laszlo as a Nazi plant who has infiltrated the upper echelons of underground movements throughout Europe; he holds the rank of colonel in the SS. She learns from Berger that Richard is in England serving in General deGaulle's Free French Army; so the lovers are brought together again. The beautiful, alluring Ilsa is, in reality, a member of the Norwegian secret service who had been deployed as a honey trap to bait Laszlo when suspicions first arose about him following the Nazi take over of Czechoslovakia. Ilsa entered into her sham marriage with Laszlo in England before the war in order to get evidence of his duplicity and, later, his links to the Norwegian traitor, Quisling. Ilsa had explained all this to Richard on their last night together. The two promised each other that they would marry but first she had to complete her work on exposing Laszlo. Richard was sworn to secrecy. Afterwards when the waiter, Carl, escorted Ilsa back from Rick's place she had given him a note in Norwegian to be delivered at once to her compatriot, Berger, instructing him to inform London that she had all the evidence against Laszlo. This was the coded message that he sent via Ferrari. Berger's mission all along had been to ensure the safety of Ilsa.<br/><br/>It takes a few months in England before Ilsa's marriage can be annulled on the grounds that it was not consummated due to the impotence of Laszlo (this explains the puzzling brother and sister like relationship between the two in the film). She and Richard married shortly thereafter with Louis as best man. A few weeks later she gives birth to Richard's son, conceived on that last night of passion at Rick's place.<br/><br/>Laszlo, still a Czech citizen, was imprisoned under the notorious British regulation 18b as an undesirable alien. His true reason for wanting to get to America had been to set up an underground sabotage ring to undermine American aid to Britain. Major Strasser's secret assignment had been to ensure that Laszlo ""escaped"" to America and to prevent his cover as an underground leader from being blown. In doing this he willingly sacrificed his own life by deliberately aiming wide at Rick so allowing Rick to fire the fatal shot. <br/><br/>Postscript: after the war Rick opened a bar in the sleazy Soho district of London, laconically calling it ""Bar of the American Patriot"".<br/><br/>Sam's piano playing was performed by Elliot Carpenter http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0139325/bio."

He is a romantic and idealist whose spirit has been crushed by the harshness of the world.<br/><br/>Soon we learn the exact circumstances of his disillusionment.  Ilsa Laszlo, played by Ingrid Bergman, wanders into his restaurant, accompanied by Victor Laszlo (Paul Henreid a hero of the anti-Nazi resistance.  They need letters of transit to escape Casablanca, and continue to fight the good fight, and soon learn that Rick has got them.  Rick however wants to retain his political neutrality, and we soon learn, is bitter that Ilsa walked out of him during a love affair that they had in Paris years ago.<br/><br/>At its heart, the film is about the need to sacrifice personal happiness for the greater good.  It probably cannot be divorced from its historical context. It was released in America when the country had just plummeted into World War 2.  In order to prevent the world from being annihilated or enslaved, ordinary people had to put aside their petty grievances and find within themselves that which is heroic.  That's what this movie is about.<br/><br/>It's also enormously entertaining. The film boasts wonderful performances by Claude Rains as Captain Louis Renault, another idealist trying to pass himself off as a cynical profiteer.  Peter Loore is delightfully slimy as Ugarte, a petty thief who tries to turn every situation to his advantage. As countless others have already said the dialogue is second to none, providing a plethora of instantly quotable lines.<br/><br/>Casablanca, is rousing, thrilling and deeply moving.  It gives us the great themes within a framework small enough to feel personal.  This is moviemaking at it's best."

","`They don't make em like that anymore!' is a well known saying normally associated with an older person commenting on something done by the younger generation. In the case of 1942's Casablanca, the comment is sadly true. That Casablanca is one of the all time great films is accepted fact. That it is a great story set solidly in its unique times and was done by several of the finest actors and actresses of any era is also accepted fact. What is not well known today is that expectations were low for this film before its New York premiere in November of 1942. Casablanca was a great war time morale builder for a United States of America still reeling from the sucker punch of Pearl Harbor. It remains today a film of intrigue, patriotism, love and human drama. That it holds up so well after 60 years may be its greatest accomplishment, and among Casablanca's many accomplishments are three academy awards. Rick Blaine (Humphrey Bogart) owns Rick's Cafe in Casablanca, a port city in French Morocco with no small amount of  back-stabbing and double dealing going on, but an important one because it is a major gateway to freedom and the west. Into his cafe and life walk freedom fighter and ex-concentration camp prisoner Victor Laszlo (Paul Henreid) and his beautiful wife and Rick's ex-lover Ilsa (Ingrid Bergman). Soon we are caught up in a three way love triangle, desperate escape attempts, menacing Nazi officers, roguish police officials (Claude Rains) and Casablanca `business' men (Sydney Greenstreet). I believe I can assume that most people reading this have seen the film so I will just say that Casablanca has a semi-happy ending as we learn that there are many situations in life that we do not understand because they are not always what they seem. In the end, 60 years after its release Casablanca holds up because it is a fine human drama made oh-so-believable and real to us by its all-star cast. The wartime atmosphere is really only icing on the cake, but what fine icing it is.<br/><br/>And what a cast. Humphrey Bogart. What man would not pay a hefty price to be able to look into the mesmerizing eyes of Ingrid Bergman and say, `Here's lookin' at you, kid.' Ingrid Bergman, the finest actress of her generation and, in the history of cinema's Grand Dames, perhaps the Grandest Dame of all, for those innocent dark eyes could make any man melt in his shoes. Claude Raines, dapper and elegant even in within the roguish role of the corrupt police Captain Louis Renault. (Isn't it interesting that yesterday's `bad guys' are in many ways more admirable than the so called `heroes' of today? Another sad commentary on our jaded times. However, in fairness I should point out that, although we suspected it all along, by film's end Renault turned out to be a better man than director Michael Curtiz wished us to think). Peter Lorre, in a small but important role as the weaselly Ugarte, gives the impression he would knife his grandmother for her church donation. Last but not least, Sydney Greenstreet, in my opinion the most menacing presence ever on the big screen, as the opportunistic Senor Ferrari turns in his usual masterful performance. It is a pity that Mr. Greenstreet's body of work in film was not greater. Still, many of the dozen or so he appeared in before his death in 1954 are considered classics today. So -- great story, superstar cast, wartime propaganda (slanted toward America and her allies. I wonder, what would have happened to Casablanca had Germany been victorious? I suspect it would be known only to a few film historians and most copies would have been destroyed. But, Germany didn't win and we do have one of filmdom's greatest readily available on VHS and DVD). Allow me a last comment on one of Casablanca's most memorable scenes. Late in the story, the Nazis are drunk in Rick's Cafe and singing loudly. I can just imagine the reaction of the 1942 theatergoers when suddenly Laszlo appears in the cafe, sees what is happening, and leads the rest of the cafe patrons in an impromptu singing of the Marseillase. The scene is powerful today, in 1942 it must have been emotional beyond description. As Bogey might have said, such is the stuff that film legend is made of!

Full of beautiful, desperate people who will do anything to make some money, get a plane ticket or get some information about the Resistance. It's seething with spies, secret agents, Nazis and Free French. The staff are quirky and witty, the piano player is sublime and over it all there is Rick's brooding presence.

","Undoubtedly the happiest of accidents, which doesn't make it any less admirable - the movie has a perfect note of romantic fatalism, a wonderful balance of comedy and drama, and a staggering array of memorable lines and incidents: however often you've seen them or heard them quoted, the moments when the screen settles into one of those legendary bits have a privileged electricity about them. The film is highly dependent on its players - apart from Rains, none of the support really has  ample time to sketch much of anything in depth, but they	re all such strong, persuasive types that the movie feels like an extraordinarily deep canvas. Compared to some other movies, Bogart's hard edge is too much a pose, too obviously ready to be wiped away; and although the movie draws strength from its almost mythic location, it's also a way of reducing the actual political elements to the point of near-abstraction - the elements of personal morality flourish here, but then they have an unnatural advantage. None of this matters very much. The movie has such huge emotional depth, representing such an enormous array of incident, that it's a triumph of economy at 100 minutes or so. Bogart is at the absolute peak of anyone's form here - there's no strained sentiment, no apparent grasping for charismatic distance or charm - he's the peak of moral self-definition interacting with a complex world on its own terms."

From the fake Casablanca town, to the fake airport scenes (which were filmed indoors) this movie is a true special effects masterpiece. They were used not to impress the audience, but to create a believable world instead. Many modern movies could have learned a lot from Casablanca.<br/><br/>And then there is that out of this world photography in black and white, which created some of the most beautiful lit closeups i ever saw in a movie so far, and made Bergman into one of the most beautiful women that ever appeared in a movie screen. Another masterpiece.<br/><br/>All this combined with a magnificent screenplay filled with memorable lines, a perfect soundtrack to each scene and a great cast. This movie will never go out of date, because of the magnificent atmosphere it has. And the characters are great, everyone in this story has some human weakness, something that we don´t see much this days. It´s this imperfections that end up creating the suspanse in the movie, because when we see it for the first time we know that anything can happen.<br/><br/>This is a fantastic movie for every reason, but at the same time for no reason at all.<br/><br/>Maybe it´s because no matter how many times we see it, this film still makes us feel something diferent.<br/><br/>This really is a masterpiece, and the best part is that it wasn´t intented to be.

The camera work progresses from normal shots in the beginning, to close-ups that fill the screen near the end.

","The only pre-MPAA rating system movie that holds its popularity and cult status from the very time it was released (even ""Gone With the Wind"" had a minor period of neglect), ""Casablanca"" is most people's primary association when they hear the word ""classic"". And rightly so: all aspects of the production have no glitches whatsoever. Plotwise, the film recounts the aftermath of a romance undermined by a disaster (in this case, a devastating war): a theme forever exploited for its box-office potential. Here, the three-hankie quotient is relatively low due to an intelligent script which concentrates on Europe's reaction to a near-apocalyptic threat to its way of life and its freedom of spirit. We also have some unforgettable musical moments (and an answer for why the Beatles used ""La Marselliase"" in ""All You Need Is Love""), the inspiration behind the Mos Eisley cantina in ""Star Wars"", the only representation of a black character up to that time that wasn't somehow demeaning, references which are widely speculated to be bisexual, and so much more! Some characters, one has to admit, are better developed than others (Bergman, who pimps herself back to Bogart in order to help the Resistance, is considerably more interesting elsewhere), but the writing is flawless and works of cinema and literature are still being named after the movie's lines of dialogue, one as recently as '95.

","Rick Blaine is perhaps one of the greatest movie characters I've ever had the pleasure of getting to know. Why? Simply because he's not perfect. At certain points in the film he perfectly embodies the cynic, the grouch, the moral coward, even the jerk. But the fact is, almost every human being who ever lived has been capable of cynical, grouchy, or cowardly behavior - and yes, all of us have been jerks at one time or another. You see, CASABLANCA is about much more than just intrigue and romance during World War II. It's about a selfish man who overcomes his self-hatred and finds the long-dormant goodness at his core. It's about overcoming obstacles and making amends for past wrongs, about rejoining the human race and rediscovering idealism. I watched this movie last night on DVD following a family Christmas party, and Humphrey Bogart made the perfect Grinch. But instead of stealing Christmas, Bogie ended up stealing victory from the jaws of the Nazis - and stealing our sympathy as well. I will never forget CASABLANCA."

"budmassey","10","0","0","6 July 2001"," Can a movie be PERFECT?
","Little can be said about this masterpiece that has not been said. Every superlative applies. The people involved in the making of Casablanca were convinced they were making just another movie meant to inspire patriotism in an America teetering on the brink of war. Indeed, in many ways, this is precisely how the movie was planned. But somewhere between then and now, Casablanca emerged as the most iconic movie of all time. <br/><br/>The story takes place shortly before America's entry into WWII. Casablanca, while unoccupied, was controlled by Vichy and was a dangerous place for enemies of the Reich. Rick Blaine (Humphrey Bogart) runs a café where everyone comes, and where shady transactions are conducted by the French Resistance. Rick maintains a delicate neutrality, with duplicitous cooperation from the local police captain, Louis Renault (Claude Rains). <br/><br/>Then the Czechoslovakian resistance leader arrives with a woman in tow, but not just any woman. She is Ilsa Lund (Ingrid Bergman), his wife, although we discover she had a passionate affair in Paris with Rick some time ago. <br/><br/>The rest of the story revolves around what Orson Welles called a McGuffin – the letters of transit. That no such papers could have existed is immaterial. The McGuffin helps the central characters discover their true nature and make decisions that will change them forever. <br/><br/>But the story is in the experience of it. As you are drawn into Casablanca, its intrigue, love, betrayal and redemption, you are transformed by it utterly. Long before postmodern deconstructionism made it de rigueur to send up treasured metaphors only to bring them crashing down, Casablanca wove them into a story that fills you with nostalgia only experienced in the collective memory of our culture, as if each event happened directly to you. <br/><br/>Embarrassingly rich with talent, the film's gravitational center is the bristling energy that radiates from Bogart and Bergman. They are luminous beings whose monochromatic images will haunt your memory forever. Paul Henreid's Victor Laszlo, like his portrayal of Jerry Durrance the same year in Now, Voyager, in a lesser movie would have been legendary. The fact that Casablanca engulfs him, as well as Claude Raines, Peter Lorre and Sidney Greenstreet, is a yardstick against which Casablanca must be measured. <br/><br/>The cast of Casablanca, in fact, is its true treasure. Humphrey Bogart appears in his first romantic lead, yet maintains the toughness and cynicism of the thug image Hollywood manufactured for him. His shell of cynicism notwithstanding, Bogart's character reveals himself to be a wounded, vulnerable man, consumed by bitterness and regret. Yet he manages, from within despair, to reinhabit his former self, rising to an epic heroism which, the film suggests, is within each of us. <br/><br/>Bergman's astonishing beauty illuminates her character. Who could gaze into those vast, glistening eyes and not be moved? Although, apropos of the time, she is portrayed as a possession to be won or lost, she transcends that image with each glance. Her immense beauty is an almost desperate counterpoint to the struggles taking place before her. <br/><br/>Paul Henreid has been roundly criticized for not being the thespian equal of his costars. But he plays his role perfectly as the self-righteous prig who represents Ilsa's tragic alternative to the man she truly loves. Had he been otherwise, Ilsa's choice would have been easy and the story would not have worked. Henreid, like every aspect of this masterpiece, is an archetype without which the story could not take place. <br/><br/>The second tier actors were equally amazing. Claude Rains, Conrad Veidt, Sidney Greenstreet, and Peter Lorre were stars in their own rights. In fact, Veidt was the highest paid actor in the film. They are delightfully complex, and yet necessarily abstract, providing still more archetypes around which to anchor the story. Rains, as the servile Vichy toady, provides delicious moments of comic irony. Much has also been made of the repressed homosexual overtones of Renault's relationship with Rick, and Rick's relationship with Sam. Whether intentional or not, this aspect merely deepens the humanity of the characters. <br/><br/>Even the supporting cast was extraordinary, many of them actual refugees from Europe, lending the story an aching realism. The famous ""Battle of the Anthems"" scene plays so real because the extras were truly moved by it, each recalling his own real-life exodus from the war. <br/><br/>If director Michael Curtiz was not a peer with contemporary auteur directors, his signature is nonetheless present in Casablanca's taut, scintillating structure. The numerous screenwriters each provided something unique. Even the cinematography was inspired, masterfully playing with images of captivity and conflict produced by shadows precisely placed for effect. <br/><br/>In the end, everything flows seamlessly, the very definition of synergy. It would be criminal, though, after considering the details of perhaps the greatest film of all time, not to come back to the personal, visceral experience of it. No matter how many times I watch Casablanca, it never fails to move me. Far from diminishing over time, the full experience matures and deepens with each viewing. I still hold my breath as each iconic moment unfolds. I still gasp when I look into Ilsa's eyes the first time. <br/><br/>But the true measure of Casablanca is the enduring respect it garners from film buffs the world over. Delicately dancing around the easy epic of World War II, the film shows us instead how great events can conspire to make even the most reprobate existence monumental.<br/><br/>This is, in my mind, the closest thing to cinematic perfection we are ever likely to see. Unfortunately, the rich cultural references will seem somewhat abstruse for viewers not familiar with history leaving the full appreciation of Casablanca beyond reach. But if you are equipped with both a brain and a heart, this movie will move you and thrill you like few can."

"clydefrogg","Null","0","0","7 March 2001"," Casablanca - In my words (MANY SPOILERS!!!)
","The other day, I read a debate of sorts where some people were questioning the greatness of Casablanca.  They went so far as to call it ""overrated"" and ""overacted"".  I had been meaning to watch it again, so I thought this time, I'd dig a little deeper to see if it perhaps is an overrated movie.  I first saw Casablanca was about 5 years ago, and I've have seen it about six or seven times now.  My first experience with Casablanca was very enjoyable. It was a pleasure to finally hear the lines and see the scenes that are so famous.  Plus, I thought the movie was very good, and that Ingrid Bergman was the most beautiful woman I'd ever seen.  Multiple viewings ensured the movie as one of my personal favorites, especially since the characters, scenes and acting seemed to get better every time.  It had been a while since I saw it before last night, and my goal was to try and figure out why I like it so much and whether or not it is ""overrated"".<br/><br/>The verdict?  Casablanca, at it's core just an anti-war propaganda film, is still arguably the best film ever made.  It (as a film, not an idea) is flawless in every way and pure joy to watch for the first time or the eighth time.<br/><br/>Surrounding Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman in Casablanca is the greatest collection of character actors ever put together in one movie.  Together, along with director Michael Curtiz, they craft a complex and layered plot against the backdrop of the greatest movie plot manufacturer, World War II.<br/><br/>Basically, Casablanca asks you to believe that Rick, a man seems to have a great setup and who claims to stick out his neck for no one, is willing to give up EVERYTHING for the cause of the movement.  To make this truly believable, the movie HAS to be perfect.  We are to believe that Rick's love for Ilsa was so great that he would have risked capture in France to follow Ilsa if she had told him the truth at the train station.  We believe that Ilsa's love for Rick is so great, that she's willing to go through years of torment knowing what she's done to Rick, but that she did it for his own good.  Then, we find out that she actually did it because her love (was it love?) was so great for another man, she had to give up Rick for him.  When all three clash in Casablanca, Ilsa gives into Rick because her love for him is so great.  But ultimately, Rick's desire to stick his neck out for no one, which had been questioned throughout the film through other characters, is abandoned and he makes the ultimate sacrifice in giving up Ilsa, his livelihood, and maybe his freedom and life for ""the cause"".<br/><br/>Do we believe all this?  Well, I do.  Primarily, it's the acting of Humprhey Bogart, Ingrid Bergman and Paul Henreid that does it for me.  The looks that Bogart and Bergman give each other are more than enough to convince.  Bogart gives us incredible insight to how painful his parting with Ilsa in Paris was, and the incredibly hateful way he treats her in Casablanca shows how much he was hurt by her actions.  Bergman, when looking at ""Rick"", expresses all the desire and regret in the world with the far away look in her eyes. On the other hand, her eyes and actions express an incredible admiration, respect and plutonic love for ""Victor"", but not a sensual love.  It's Bergman's emotion in her portrayal of Ilsa that convinces us of these feelings.  Words alone would not have sufficed.  When she makes the decisions she does, I buy them because she is so convincing. <br/><br/>
All that being said, the character/actor that really makes the whole thing work is Paul Henreid/""Victor"".  Henreid depicts a person that is so passionate about his calling (leader of the French resistance against Germany), but at the same time, loves Ilsa so much that he is and has been unwilling to leave her no matter what the cost.  He did not leave her side when she was sick for two weeks despite the danger it left him in, and he won't leave her in Casablanca.  And she won't leave him.  Henreid's Victor is a great leader, and unafraid of anything.  For such an important character, again, the words are not enough.  Action and emotion was essential to the believability of Victor's character, and thus, the whole story.  An example of this, and of what makes Casablanca so great, is the scene at Rick's when Victor leads the patrons in the French anthem La Marseillaise.  At the time, the members of the German Third Reich that are present at Rick's are singing a rousing Nazi song, The Watch on the Rhine. Victor goes to the band and instructs them to start La Marseillaise.  The band members look at Rick for his guidance, and he quietly nods his head in approval.  Remember, this is the guy who sticks his neck out for no one. Victor then sings unabashedly, and inspires the predominantly French and French sympathetic crowd to join him, and they drown the Nazi's out.  I am sixty years and an ocean removed from this time and place, but am still incredibly moved by this scene nonetheless.  <br/><br/>We are convinced with an episode like this that Victor is indeed a great leader, and it is ESSENTIAL that he get out of the inevitable danger that lies in Casablanca.  We know this, and more importantly, Ilsa realizes this. She will do ANYTHING, as evidenced by her pulling the gun on Rick to try and force him to give up the letters of transit.  But EVEN MORE importantly, Rick realizes what a great leader and important man Victor is, and that Victor loves Ilsa.  Rick knows that Ilsa is essential to Victor, she's ""the thing that keeps him going"".  So he must help Victor, and to do so, he must give up Ilsa, who has previously given into him.  Remember Rick must ""do the thinking for all of us"".  And not only does Rick have to give up Ilsa to help Victor, he must sell his cafe, hold the prefect at gunpoint and eventually kill a Nazi to ensure Victor and Ilsa leave.  He risks the sacrifice of everything for Victor and his cause.<br/><br/>Lost in all this, again, is the great array of characters in the movie.  Not the least of which is the Prefect of Police Renault, played by Claude Rains. He behaves much like Rick throughout the whole movie, looking out only for himself.  He, like Rick, isn't entirely on the up and up.  In the end, of course, he and Rick turn out to be not such bad guys, after all.  And Rick and Renault's mutual respect for each other leads, of course, to possibly the most famous line to ever end a movie.  Simply magical.  Great comic banter is provided by Sydney Greenstreet, who plays Ferrari, a competitor of Rick's, as well as S.Z. Skall, playing the Carl the head waiter. <br/><br/>
Great direction by Michael Curtiz, photography by Arthur Edeson (who also did The Maltese Falcon) and a score only add to the perfection of this movie.  The real magic is in what was created by Bogart, Bergman and Henreid.  Bergman, in particularly, is simply radiant and electric.  I can't think of a more beautiful woman that I've ever seen in a particular movie. I also find it simply amazing that the script for Casablanca was practically written as they went along.  The movie was shot in sequence with an unfinished script, and the actors and crew didn't know how the whole thing would end.  It's amazing because every thought and action exhibited by the principal players, even those early in the film, are consistent with the ultimate destinies of the characters.  HOW did they do that???  Casablanca is a flawless work of art and seems almost as if it was destined for greatness by how it all magically comes together.  Not only is it great, but it's flat out incredibly fun to watch."

The worst thing that has ever happened to this movie was the issue of a colorized version several years ago, which is actually difficult to find.

","After a long time waiting, I finally sat down and made the time to watch Casablanca. Always hearing about the greatness of this film I knew that it had to be good, however, I still had my doubts. After all, Bogey playing a suave, yet hard-nosed romantic? After watching this film, all of my doubts were erased and I realized that this was one of the top films of all time.<br/><br/>I find the fact that Casablanca was just another film (one of 50 films made by Warner Studios each year) amazing. The fact that the script of this film was made as the film was shot is also amazing considering that this is one of the greatest scripts ever written. For a romantic picture of the '40's this movie moves incredibly well. The war sub-plot of the film to me is what really kept the film moving at such a pace. Even though the film takes place over one day, the feeling of the war going on at the same time increases the sense of speed in the film. The war makes the flashback scene which also really completes the film. Perhaps some of the greatest film moments of all time occur in these short three minutes which contain more than most films do in two hours. The chemistry between Bogart and Bergman has such a presence in this film that makes the ending such a tragedy followed by such a redemption. Few films have neared the closeness of the two actors in this film. Throw in Paul Henried and his charming performance and you have a deadly love triangle that has been rarely surpassed. The song and score of this film are two more elements that make it so enchanting. The way that ""As time goes by"" is heard throughout the film gives it that haunting, yet subtle undertone that makes this movie so great. I feel that more than anything else, it was the music of this film that held everything together.<br/><br/>Casablanca's cast of such variable characters has also been rarely if ever matched by another film. Three performances struck me in this film as being more than supporting characters, even though they were only supporting characters. Claude Rains as the Chief Renaud now ranks as one of my all-time favourites, Sydney Greenstreet as Ferrari has a short but poignant role, powerful enough to match up with Bogey and Dooley Wilson as Rick's best friend Sam plays another subtle, but powerful role. It is the personality mix of the characters that makes the film so overwhelming and interestingly enough, there is no true antagonist (Strasses comes close, yet still doesn't truly fulfill the role of the antagonist). The theme of lost love in this film is what made it so special for myself and many others.  However, the ending leaves the viewer with the feeling that what had happened was the right way to end the relationship, because after all ""they had Paris.""<br/><br/>The values, themes and ideas of this film will always hold true for me and I am glad that after all I was able to see this great piece of filmmaking.<br/><br/>9/10 stars."

","An example of true greatness in film, Casablanca is, perhaps, the most popular film of all time.

"das-7","10","0","0","22 January 2001"," The Classic Romance Thriller
","An exceptional ensemble cast, a richly textured script, and director Michael Curtiz's gift for observing rather than passing judgement upon the behaviour of ordinary people in extraordinary circumstances make Casablanca an outstanding film nearly a half century after its release. The film itself takes its tone from the Richard Blaine character with its deft blend of cynicism and engagement, ironic detachment and the dormant capacity to Believe. Coming as it did in the early years of the Second World War, when the outcome was far from certain, Casablanca stands as an astonishing act of bravado that offers a measure of hope without collapsing into propaganda slogans about the inevitability of victory. The particular ambiguity of the Vichy regime (that arresting opening, with the fleeing man shot under the the wall portrait of Marechal Petain proclaiming ""I keep not only my promises, but those of others"") is vividly captured in Casablanca, embodied in Capitaine Renault. The central romance has perhaps become a cliche in the eyes of modern viewers, because there have been so many parodies, reinterpretations, imitations. Yet there is something thrilling about a romance in which the carnality is implied rather than displayed in numbing (dare one say dull) detail, the easy way out taken by so many modern directors. Indeed, the most recent modern parallel to the plangent sexuality of Casablanca is the prison cell scene in Gladiator. Altogether a marvellous film of abiding quality, and just as a bonus, it offers the second-most blood-stirring version of the Marseillaise you will hear (first place is still claimed by Jessye Norman, draped in the French tricouleur, moving down the Champs Elysees, bringing tears to the soldiers of the honour guard during the bicentenary of the French Revolution)."

She is now married to resistance leader Victor Laszio (Paul Henreid) on the run from the Germans.

","Citizen Kane and Casablanca are two innovative films from the 1940's, yet they differ in genre and style.  While Casablanca has a relatively straightforward love story complete with wartime propaganda, Citizen Kane has a narrative structure as a dialectical montage. Casablanca has depth of characters, themes of love, power, valor and sacrifice put together with straight narrative: Boy meets girl, boy looses girl, boy tries to get girl back. Citizen Kane, on the other hand makes use of rich differing styles. It begins with the expressionistic death, then is interrupted with the newsreel and booming voice-of-god, then moves into the projection room with reporters, shadows and smoke.<br/><br/>Casablanca, however, makes great use of good dialogue and strong focus on the actors as deep characters.  Redemption is also something achieved at the end at the cost of love.

","I have usually been bored or disappointed with the so-called ""timeless classics"" I have bothered to watch, but not with this one. It has its flaws, but for some reason it just works anyway. Some of the flaws are: Laszlo's character, which is so totally virtuous you just want to take out a gun and shoot him immediately (it was fine for the 40's, but I think we expect a bit more ambiguity in nice guys nowadays); the ridiculous final scene where we're expected to believe that Renault continues obeying Rick's instructions even though Rick has forgotten all about pointing his gun at him because he's too busy saying sweet nothings to Ilsa; and just generally I'm afraid the film is a bit sappy and full of cliches (and don't tell me this film invented the cliches, it didn't: they're as old as corny love stories, and those go back very far indeed). The reason it just works anyway is, I think, simply Bogart. No one ever incarnated so perfectly the man every man wishes he was and the man every woman wishes she could meet. And he smokes so beautifully... Bergman is great too, but her character isn't nearly as well developed.<br/><br/>A word of advice: if you haven't seen the film before and you happen to get hold of the ""special edition"" with 1/2 hour of ""making of"" stuff before the feature, fast-forward to the film and watch it before watching the introductory material, because it is spoiler city."

","One thing is for certain: Humphrey Bogart is the man who speaks for himself. I just watched this movie at last, after trying to find an opportunity to watch it for quite some time now.  I've never watched Bogart before, and Casablanca was as good a start as any.  Let me say that I am quite impressed!  We are living in a world today where men try to emulate and women are quite taken by those men who are the paragon of the tough, solid man, often with an attitude, which is all the while a somewhat thin front for a sense of sentiment and nobility.  Or, to put it another way, we love the bad-ass with a heart and a sense of right.  With all the actors that we see nowadays, and all the characters that they portray, it's easy to forget who many of these Hollywood molds owe their respects to.  And, in this movie, Bogart is the man, one of the originals, a 1942 tough act, class act, a man who shows others how to be a man.<br/><br/>This is his movie all the way, and he makes it a man's movie.  Don't get settled in on Ingrid Bergman too much, however beautiful she may be.  She's plays a tough woman, but Bogart is control.  And nevermind Paul Henreid, taller and perhaps more handsome than Bogart.  He may have the heroic reputation, but Bogart's cynicism makes him identifiable.  The things that Bogart's character, Rick, went through, and the new situation he is presented with, were very familiar to me and, I'm sure, to others.  What do you do when the one you love is with another?  What do you do when there is nothing wrong or, worse yet, it is the better thing to do for her to be with the other?  What do you do when the power then lies within you to decide whom she will then belong to, you or him?  Weaker men would fold.  Bogart takes the situation and tells it where it can go.<br/><br/>I was quite happy with what I saw as the movie finished up.  It was a movie, as others have boasted in its name, that required no special effects, no fancy twisted storyline, and no distracting side plots.  It's a tight package, wrapped up nicely and presented almost as straightforward as could be.  Best of all, though, it's a story told about the strength of one character, and one character alone.  It's about his point of view, his dilemma, his solution.  It's about Rick, and only Bogart could have pulled off Rick in this memorable way.  This is Bogart's movie.  Watch the screen portray the strength of the man."

","Casablanca remains one of the best loved films ever. made at a time when the world was in crisis, it shows that the affairs of some little people actually can amount to a hill of beans. There are of course moments of superb dialogue, much of which is taken by the supporting characters Louis (Claude Rains) and also Urgarti (Sydney Greenstreet). Lines such as (I'm only a poor corrupt official"" and ""I'm shocked, shocked!"" have not become as famous as Bogart's ""of all the gin joints..."" line, but they always manage to raise a wry smile, worthy of Bogie himself. Of course it seems slightly clichéd, but imagine how terrible it would have been, were it not for the wonderful acting, and often stiring direction of Curtiz. The McTiernan of his day, Curtiz manages to keep the film moving at a quick, but not too quick pace. We bleed with Bogart, sing with Sam and idolise Henried. When I first watched the film, I longed for there to have been a sequel, but that would have missed the point. ""Casablanca"" was a   one off. It could not have been repeated, as it was a curious mixture of atmosphere and something impossible to define. It is easy to imagine falling in love with Bergman, but it is impossible to imagine the torn identity of Blane. We do not live in a world such as this, and perhaps no one ever did. Casablanca is a fairy tale. If it were not, Berger would have shot Rick, but he did not. It is a clichéd tale about love, redemtion comradship and war.

While the whole world seemed to be crumbling, the city provided a sanctuary from the madness and doubled as a way-station for refugees leaving one war torn part of the globe trying to make it to America. By every account however, the law in this place was a matter of opinion and could be bent or even broken for the right price.<br/><br/>Traveling papers are like gold.

Here goes...<br/><br/>The Humphrey Bogart we all came to know and love first appeared in this crown jewel of Hollywood's Golden Era. Virtually everything we ever associated with a Bogart character (cynicism, romanticism, disrespect for unjust authority, doing the right thing in spite of himself) came from this film. My favorite scene of his has to be when he refuses to let the German banker into the gambling action:<br/><br/>""Your money's good at the bar.""<br/><br/>""Do you know who I am?!""<br/><br/>""I do! You're lucky the bar's open to you!""<br/><br/>Ingrid Bergman has never been so lovely. The charming lilt in her voice never ceases to be music to my ears every time I hear it. I'D fall for her, no doubt about it. Peter Lorre's role is small, but vital to the plot. Let's face it, nobody ever played a spineless, underhanded wimp better than Lorre. Dooley Wilson will forever stay etched in my mind for ""As Time Goes By"" so long as I live. Claude Rains, the only person in the entire cast to show off more cynicism than Bogie, is an utter delight, doesn't care one way or another until that last moment at the airport. Paul Henreid, one of the most underrated actors of the '40s (check him out in ""Now, Voyager""), is superbly sublime as the principled, eloquent Resistance fighter. Contrary to some reports, he's not a sap who has no idea what's going on between Bergman and Bogie. My suspicion has always been that he knew a lot more than he ever let on. Finally we have Conrad Veidt, the very epitome of the sadistic Nazi commader. Veidt had inpeccable credentials for such a role: he'd been imprisoned by the Nazis during the 1930's. Plenty of opportunity to study the real thing up close and personal, one would agree.<br/><br/>Lest I forget, I feel a special mention should go to director Michael Curtiz, who keeps the plot rolling along at the pace of a bullet train. Anyone who likes this one should check out his other great classics with Errol Flynn, ""Captain Blood"" and ""The Adventures of Robin Hood"". A director of good taste and great skill, he should be remembered as well as anyone else for his contribution to this cinematic masterpiece."

","There are so many reasons why this is the greatest movie ever made. Here are some of my main reasons:<br/><br/>1. There is not one single poor performance.<br/><br/>2. The film surpasses a mere love story. It contains some splendid jokes, political intrigue, acts of war, corrupt officials, black marketeering, violence, and moral courage.<br/><br/>3. As for that love story, can you think of any more mature exposition in movie history of the classic love triangle? The dynamics between Rick, Ilsa and Viktor are perfectly judged: Rick wants to hurt the woman who left him for what he sees as an inferior man (but whom he secretly admires); Ilsa is torn between her duties as a wife and the partner of an international hero, and the genuine passion she feels for Rick; Viktor knows exactly what his wife is feeling, but finds it easier to be a martyr, because he thinks that's his duty.<br/><br/>4. The photography is terrific (example: when Rick opens the safe to get the money out just before Major Strasse arrive - we see only his shadow on the world, dwarfing Claude Rains).<br/><br/>5.

I found it so gripping when they were on screen together. What a dynamic duo. The story between Rick and Ilsa was so compelling in every way. The story also led into the narrative of Victor Laszlo (Henreid) and Sam (played by the superb Dooley Wilson who sang ""As Time Goes By"").

"Cosmoeticadotcom","6","4","12","26 December 2008"," Good, not great
","First, let's go with the performances of some of the leading characters, and let me start by stating that most of the characterizations of the acting abilities of the actors in this film, by critics, are often quite wrongheaded. Let us start with the three top billed actors, Humphrey Bogart as club owner Rick Blaine, Ingrid Bergman as his ex-lover Ilsa Lund, and Paul Henreid as Ilsa's husband, the Czechoslovakian Nazi Resistance outlaw, Victor Laszlo. Virtually all critiques of this trio leave Henreid as the odd man out, mainly because the film focuses on the love angle between Rick and Ilsa. But, from a purely technical standpoint, Henreid gives, by far, the best acting performance of the trio (and, it's not even close). Because it is the most restrained and understated, however, it usually gets dismissed as stiff acting, rather than good acting of an intentionally stiff character....one need only look at the cheesy scene in the bar, where Victor hears the Nazis singing their song, Die Wacht Am Rhein, and dares to get the band to play La Marseillaise, then look in Victor's eyes, to see that, far from what critics claim, Victor is a man of great passion and principles from the get go, and this break from his usual restraint gains in power precisely because it is a break, but one that seems wholly natural for a man who has been frustrated for the bulk of his scenes in the film, and then feels he is having his face rubbed in it. While the political implications of the scene have lost their resonance (as do most blatantly political gestures in art), Henreid's volcanically restrained performance in that scene has not. And, as an asides, compare that scene with a similar scene toward the ends of the aforementioned Paths Of Glory, where a captured German girl is put on stage, in front of drunken French soldiers seemingly willing to ravage her, until she starts singing a plaintive German tune of a soldier and his lost love. The drunk soldiers quiet down, and eventually start humming along with the 'enemy,' and slowly show that they have not been totally inured by carnage. A comparison of these two scenes (their structure and placement) neatly and clearly shows why Casablanca is mere entertainment, while Paths Of Glory is great art. Simply stated, without the character (in his physical being and internal composition) of Victor Laszlo, Casablanca does not even reach being a good prose melodrama.<br/><br/>Now, contrast Henreid's Victor with Bogart's Rick. Rick is rather one dimensional, despite the film's early evocations of depth. His attraction to Ilsa seems quite superficial; after all, in the flashback scenes in Paris, and even those in Casablanca, does he ever speak of higher purpose? Despite some wittier lines....is Rick Blaine sufficiently different from the Sam Spade Bogart essayed in The Maltese Falcon, or any of the rather stolid thugs he played throughout the 1930s? No. <br/><br/>That brings me to the last and least of the trio of star performances: Ingrid Bergman's rather mediocre portrayal of Ilsa Lund. First, it's not a bad performance, but it's nowhere near great. One need only look at contemporaneous performances by a Katherine Hepburn, Joan Crawford, Bette Davis, or even Judy Garland, to see how much Bergman pales in contrast. And, it's rather apparent that Ilsa really loves Victor, not Rick, because anyone who's ever really been in love knows that she would have stayed with Rick, no matter. <br/><br/>But the biggest thing that prevents the film from greatness is that it simply plumbs no depths, it simply has no great themes. There is nothing in the film that is so overwhelmingly great, technically or performance-wise, that can put it in a class with many of the other highly praised great films of the past. Seen next to Citizen Kane, Tokyo Story, Seven Samurai, La Dolce Vita, or 2001: A Space Odyssey, Casablanca comes up short, way short. <br/><br/>On the plus side, Casablanca is quite a modern film, in terms of pacing (and in some aspects of editing), for within the first ten or twelve minutes, you feel as if you know these archetypal characters (for good or ill), as if you'd already had a full movie's worth of them under your belt, and this is part of the reason why the film sucks you in to its vortex, and gets better, subjectively, as it goes on, even if, objectively, it's a fairly static film, in terms of plotting. <br/><br/>Film critic Andrew Sarris claimed that Casablanca was, 'the most decisive exception to the auteur theory,' but he was wrong, and wrong for several reasons. First, auteur theory generally applies toward films or filmmakers that are great, and while Casablanca has been claimed as great, no one has ever made that claim for Curtiz. Secondly, greatness is part and parcel of a vision, and vision is, almost by definition, a property only a singular person can have, not a group; thus Sarris's very admission that Casablanca had more than one 'auteur' makes it also outside the scope of auteur theory, by definition, not an exception to the theory....the film lacks vision, and is a stylistic and narrative hodgepodge. Still, it does entertain, and is an interesting piece of Americana. Also, the lower the expectations you have of the film, the more entertaining it seems. Ah, the flicker of illusion!"

","Many years ago, I went to see this classic as a part of the series ""The Masterpieces of the World Cinema"" in one of the best Moscow theaters. I fell asleep. I never tried to see it again until couple of weeks ago when I did not fell asleep but I wish I did. I wish I have not seen it, so, I would have beautiful illusions that the film was incredible - now I know it is not. I understand that I am against the best part of international movie watching community that believes ""Casablanca"" is one of or even THE Best film ever made. I feel like I am witnessing the largest case of ""The King Is Naked"" here.<br/><br/>Of course, there are some parts of the film that I like but I did not find it brilliant, inspirational, breathtaking, moving, deep or stunning. I confess I am guilty of using some memorable quotes of the film, like ""We'll always have Paris"" but after hearing Bogart saying, ""Here, looking at you, kid"" for the third or fourth time I thought I would explode. I did not find the film very romantic and I don't believe that Bogart and Bergman played the best roles of their careers.<br/><br/>For me, the worst scene that left me speechless in disbelieve was the one where Rick (Bogart) became a ""cynic with the heart of gold"" and helped a young Bulgarian couple to win the money for the visas. I know it should feel good but it was so false and unnaturally acted by all actors involved I could not believe my eyes and my ears.<br/><br/>I love Ingrid Bergman but she was so not herself in the film, IMO, so not passionate. And that perfectly arranged tear on her cheek - like in the movie...<br/><br/>My beloved film-maker Woody Allen adores ""Casablanca"" and he even wrote a love letter to it in the form of a play, and later a movie called ""Play It Again, Sam"" (1972) which I saw recently. In the movie which Allen did not direct himself but which is still his from the first to the final shot, he plays Allan, a neurotic movie buff who writes the film reviews (what else?). Allan not just loves movies; he lives in the movies' world and constantly takes advices on how to get the girls from the legendary hero of his all time favorite movie ""Casablanca"", Humphrey Bogart's Rick. I am not a fan of ""Casablanca"" at all and I am not going to see it again but if my favorite Artist is so much in love with it, I admit that there may be something special in it.

CASABLANCA is a case in point . Anything I or anyone else writers here is entirely superfluous because any insight has already been said and anyone saying anything negative is instantly considered a contrition merely for the sake of it . CASABLANCA is cinematic legend . End of . It should be noted however that despite being broadcast on a relatively regular basis in the 1970s on British television it hasn't appeared very often in recent years . It might be wrong to point out that it was a mainstay in the top ten of the IMDb top 250 but nowadays it's sliding down the list as more people are exposed to it and perhaps think its legendary status isn't as deserved as it could have been . Perhaps I too belong to that camp <br/><br/>The reputation means so many people have actually forgotten what the film is about . Slightly patriotic flag waver where the forces of democracy get one over on the vile Nazis , slightly romantic pot boiler , and very much redemption plot it's a film that does have a feelgood factor . The story revolves around Rick , an embittered cynic who is only interested in profiting from the war and as events turn out he's about to discover that there's somethings far more important than money . Everything could have been done a little bit better especially when you consider Michael Curtiz is very much a contender for best film director of the 20th Century who made a lot of differing genre films and was always very good at what he did . His problem was that his films weren't marketed for a bitterly cynical audience in the 21st Century and seem a little bit too old fashioned when seen today . That said the up side is you enjoy classic Hollywood with its emphasis on stardom , dialogue and feel good factor there's a lot to admire in CASABLANCA but you have go in to it with the certain knowledge that it's not quite the masterwork its legendary reputation suggests it is <br/><br/>That is the main problem with Michael Curtiz in general and CASABLANCA in particular . A film like ANGELS WITH DIRTY FACES doesn't contain one single scene or line of dialogue that can be classed as realistic in anyway and a film like that which has lines such as "" Okay fellas let's say a prayer for a kid who couldn't run as fast as me "" would see pop corn and drinks thrown at the screen in 2014 .

","On the form, one can't deny that the actors are all rather accurate and most importantly that the cinematography is so refined it doesn't give the impression the movie was shot in 1942.<br/><br/>Now the problem lies in the content. The first half of the film is pretty annoying, endeavouring to set the tone of a plot that struggles to really initiate its development. The pace accelerates in the second half, reviving the interest, but the dramatic progression remains quite difficult, and the movie overall doesn't turn out to be convincing enough despite well written dialogues. Moreover, it falls sometimes a bit too easily into melodramatiscim, with for instance a much too grandiloquent soundtrack that tires quickly.<br/><br/>Anyway, for sure Casablanca was a pioneer in its time, but like a lot of other old classics, critics seem to favour too much this aspect compared to the intrinsic quality of the movie, which would explain why it is so highly regarded."

One would be hard-pressed to discern anything particularly radical about the film's primary components. Though captivating in their own way, the story, the characters and the direction are modest and unassuming. Yet it is a modesty tightly wrapped in excellence and precision. Simply put, this is as good as conventional cinematic storytelling ever gets. <br/><br/>During the height of World War II, Rick Blaine (Humphrey Bogart) is the impervious American owner of a Casablancan nightclub, serving as the epicenter of social unease in what is still unoccupied France. The unexpected arrival of Czechoslovakian resistance organizer Viktor Lazslo (Paul Henreid) and his dazzling wife Ilsa (Ingrid Bergman) forces Rick to revisit his painful past and take sides in a war he had previously tried to ignore.<br/><br/>The alluring, cosmopolitan backdrop of colonial North Africa compliments a remarkable cast of three-dimensional characters, who exhaust and renew their humanity amidst war's cataclysmic turmoil. Negative elements, including the unfortunate absence of native characters, as well as the demeaning treatment of the nightclub's black entertainer (Dooley Wilson, condescendingly referred to as ""the boy"" despite his advanced age), are not strong enough to withstand the overwhelming intensity of a truly exceptional film. Seven stars out of ten."

Each scene is so jam packed with information about either the love story between Rick and Ilsa, or the café, or the Nazis. Each scene is very busy with so many people; your eyes do not know where to look first. It is almost as if it is too many stories in one film. All the the sets of the film were rather beautiful. In the city of Casablanca there are stone sidewalks, and dim lights. Ricks Café and the Blue Parrot are just two of the many ""cool"" places to be in Casablanca. The characters also fit in well with the story. Although I did not care much for Ilsa. This is because it always seemed as though she wanted to ""have her cake and eat it too."" She was married to a caring and loyal man, and she decides to cheat on him with the mysterious Rick. For this reason I very much so enjoy the ending when Rick forces Ilsa to go on the plane with her husband. We expected the opposite out of such a suave love story.

One thing this movie made clear is that they use to drink and smoke a lot. Just about every scene there doing both, constantly. The relationship between Rick and Ilsa Lund does get a little more interesting when you find out there history but in the end Rick doesn't end up with here so who care's? yeah he did the right thing because he knew she'd have a better life with Victor Laszlo but that just ruined the movie for me.

","I've had this DVD sitting on my shelf for a while, and I'd been working my way through all of the other movies surrounding it. I finally forced myself to watch it using the logic of ""it's ranked high on the IMDb Top 250, how bad could it be"".<br/><br/>To clarify, I am not saying that Casablanca is a bad movie, I'm just not saying it's fantastic. I can see how it might be ""groundbreaking"" and ""innovative"" back when it was made in the 40's, but in todays world, it is not amazing. It's very difficult to compare a movie from the 40's to a movie from the 21st century, in fact the only way I know to compare movies is based on my afterthoughts. <br/><br/>What qualifies a movie as 10 stars for me, is a movie that either gives me the chills at the needs because of how amazing the ending was, or if the movie keeps me thinking about it for days afterward. It's a movie that has an ending that is permanently engraved in me. Movies like The Shawshank Redmption, The Sixth Sense, The Intouchables, Memento, The Green Mile, Full Metal Jacket, etc...<br/><br/>A 9 star movie is a movie that I find to be entertaining, but not quite as memorable as a 10 star. The 9 star category for me has a lot of good movies in the category, such as Pulp Fiction, American Beauty, One Flew Over The Cuckoos Nest, Fight Club, etc... <br/><br/>However, Casablanca is not as memorable as any of those movies either. The movie is not, I just don't find myself challenged by the movie. The acting was okay, but nothing that blew my mind. I understand the message of the movie, and how powerful it was supposed to be. The movie was slow, too slow for me. It left me with the same problems as the Godfather; I think that the movie is building up to some dramatic ending, but then it just mellows out. <br/><br/>This seems like the kind of movie that was regarded as the best of all time for many years, but, unfortunately for fans of this movie, there are many other movies that surpass this one. My opinion is that people tend to rate movies they consider ""classics"" higher than the new blockbusters, even if both eras are capable of producing movies that are equally as good as one another. <br/><br/>Honestly, the only reason why this movie doesn't get a higher rating than it has (from me) is because there was never a part in the movie where I felt like I couldn't take my eyes off the screen, but there were scenes where I began to fall asleep. Five minutes after the movie was over, I found myself thinking about my plans for the following day, and what I planned on having for dinner. When I watched higher rated movies, for example Into The Wild (10 stars), I found myself putting myself into the protagonists situation, and then i found myself running to the bookstore to get the book about the true story. This movie didn't have that lasting impression on me.<br/><br/>Even though my opinion is most likely contrary to every other movie watcher on here, I think that i have a valid point by saying that this moving brings nothing ""revolutionary"" to the table, and by that I mean that there is no part of this movie that leaves me teary eyed, laughing hysterically, or piece together a complex mystery. The movie is just... ehh..."

","The acting was great. But honestly, I felt that was about it. I don't know why this film is up there. Perhaps it is a classic, but just because something is classic and used to be popular is good doesn't mean it is good in the current day. By current day standards, the plot is sub-par.<br/><br/>Sure, the plot is alright, but compared to the plots of modern films, it isn't great. Of course it made a major contribution to films of the time and to history, but it doesn't mean that it is a good movie to watch for entertainment now.<br/><br/>Storyline was decent and writing was pretty good, but not really interesting.<br/><br/>Acceptable, to watch for historical value, but I wouldn't show this movie to someone who wants entertainment."

","Casablanca is about a club owner (Bogart) who has in his position to paper that will let anyone leave WWII Casablanca no questions asked. Bogart tries to keep everyone happy, which included the French police, Nazi officers, customers, and his one competitor. Through out the movie Bogart is is debating weather or not he should help the husband of his past lover, who happens to be a leader of a large underground movement against the Nazis. In the end he helps them escape just in time, before the Nazi officers arrive at the airport, and he and the police chief become friends once again.

","War is not that bad, I get defeated, you occupy me. How dare they are, with the world crumbling, they pick to fall in love. there is war out there, there is pain, sorrow, hopelessness.but surrounded by death and fear, they decide to set their hearts free, to enjoy their very life no matter how much overwhelming. In any category sorted by anyone, Casablanca definitely is included as one of the classics. Its genre is combination of war, romance and drama, and that is exactly what makes it so delightful. Humphrey Bogart (Rick) undoubtedly was one of the finest actors of all time and unanimously speaking, Casablanca is his best. Rick is an excellent epitome of a guy who gets tough and tougher without loosing tender. His former love leaves him high and dry in a train station in Paris and after countless restless nights of pining and sorrow he has moved on and began to run a night club in north of Africa. He is a prominent man in the town ,witty, arrogant, disdainful, clever and showing no interest for politics in spite of his former records .but deep down inside he is so heart-tender ,one of a kind lover and caring about people's lives. Then, one they out of blue, Ilsa (Ingrid Bergman) , his ex, walks into the bar, with her husband, demanding Sam(piano player) to play ""as time goes by"", and what is more instigating than a piece of music that reminds you of a sacred memory?! Greater the love, greater the tragedy when it's over In this movie there exist two distinguished epic scenes that emotionally for sure will change your heart beats. Once approximately in the middle of the movie there was a scene aka as 'The Battle of the Anthems' in which a group of German soldiers had come into Rick's cafe and were intoxicatingly singing the German National anthem loudly. Victor Lazlo(Ilsa's husband), the leader of the French Resistance, cannot stand this act and while the rest of the club stared reluctantly with fear at the Germans, ordered the band to play the French National Anthem, accompanied by a confirming nod from Rick, the band begins playing, with Victor singing at the top of his voice as a pioneer. This inspires the whole club to begin singing along and the Germans are forced to surrender and sit down at their table, humbled by the crowd's dedication. In my book, this was the most appealing part of the movie.<br/><br/>In the second place, in the half way through the film a Bulgarian girl comes to Rick asking if Captain Renault is trustworthy. She and her husband are refugees. there is war in their country, they have left their house, they have no money, they are fleeing from death, from misery from fear. they need visas or something and it is inferred that captain Renault has promised her to trade the paperwork they need with couple of minutes of her time .now she is in a dilemma. Frightened, hopeless and fragile. suspended between their security and her self- esteem, now she wants to know if she grants her body to Captain Renault will he do them the favor back or not. And in the case if he does in Rick's opinion what she is going to do is forgivable?! Ilsa flashes in Rick's mind and he replies the Bulgarian girl in a line:"" go back to Bulgaria"". Stating that in his idea it's better to suffer and murdered than selling one-self. Though he afterwards he does a marvelous thing and helps the husband to win in gambling and provide the money they need to regulates their migration.<br/><br/>To put the whole thing in a nutshell, Casablanca is a mixture of all life giving elements. overlapping of humor and drama, love and war, toughness and heart-tenderness. And hell yeah it is amusing."

","Casablanca cannot be fully appreciated until its audiences realize just how much it relates to history. Being one of this movie's audience members of today robs me of exactly what the feelings of society were when this movie came out. During my cinema history class, we discussed the significance of this film which served great importance. Although the movie had a bit of a dark view to it (well, it was in black and white) and it seemed a bit confusing at times, it was overall a great movie. I must admit, I did get a bit lost and I felt that the storyline tended to be a bit clear. However, this tale of a war-based romance is gripping and intriguing. The main character, Rick, faces huge life hurdlesincluding facing and finding his long lost love. It is a universal theme of abandoned love, with a historical twist of World War II. Overall, this wartime romance and adventure is worth the watch."

","In Casablanca, Morocco, during World War II, there is a place called Rock's run by an American where fugitives can meet safely and enjoy a refreshing drink and soothing music. Think of it as a 1940s Mos Eisley Cantina, if you will. And at the center of it all? Rick, played by Humphrey Bogart.<br/><br/>It really goes without saying that this film is a classic, and probably one of the most famous and highly acclaimed films ever, as well as being Humphrey Bogart's biggest role. It is quotable, the scenes have been emulated or parodied scores of times... what more can I say that hasn't been said over the last sixty-odd years? <br/><br/>So, I will say two things: one, this film loses nothing to time. Despite being a clear period piece (filmed during WWII and taking place as a war film, sort of) it resonates just as strongly today with audiences as it did the first day. And also, it exceeded my expectations. Surely I thought it would be good. But often when films (or anything, really) have something of a legendary status, the hype is difficult to match. ""Casablanca"" matched the hype and at times went above and beyond. From the opening scene with the spinning globe, I knew this was going to be the next step in film history -- perhaps ""Casablanca"" is the first modern film?"
"redryan64","10","2","5","8 December 2007"," Universally Loved Film, Rated at Top of American Films! (whisper) And, don't tell the Guys; but it has all the markings of a ""Woman's Picture""!
","Well now, let's begin at the beginning, for what do we say about this most favourtie all time Romance-Adventure that hasn't been said already? It seems that just about everyone has this at or near the top of their own list of films to own and watch over, now and again. And any commentary mad is complicated by the multi-plane storyline. <br/><br/>On a seemingly lightweight amusement level, we have the story of a highly unique Night Club, ""Rick's Café Americaine."" It is owned and operated by the expatriate American, one Richard Blaine (Bogart). The Club owes its large and loyal crowd of supporters to the American Style of Music provided by the Orchestra, particularly by the Black American Pianist, Sam (Dooley Wilson). All would appear to be a fine, relaxing and enjoyable to pass some leisure time and forget one's mundane existence, even for a little while.<br/><br/>But the Café is in the city of Casablanca, the principal city of Morocco, then a French Colony, in North Africa. Along with Tunisia, Algeria and French West Africa, Morocco formed a huge, contiguous French land mass which would be in control of the Vichy French Government. The what, I hear out there?<br/><br/>Following the defeat of France and their surrender to Hitler, the Country was partitioned. The Northern part was designated as being Occupied France, being completely run from Berlin by Hitler. The Southern portion of the Country was designated as ""Unoccupied France"" and was allegedly free and independent. But it was proved to be anything but free and certainly not independent. It was headed up by the World War I Military hero; Marshal Petain (now considered to be a stone traitor). The new government was headquartered in the City of Vichy; hence, the term Vichy France or Vichy French. With all of that business attended to, we can now get on to CASABLANCA.<br/><br/>OUR STORY..As we enter into the story, we find that the city of Casablanca is over-run with all ethnicities of Refugee people caught up in the Never-Never Land of the Post 1940 French era. All of this occurs after the Fall of France and their surrender to Nazi Germany. That subject matter alone would certainly be enough to give more substance (or even 'gravitas' *) to the story.<br/><br/>That Casablanca had become a terminal for the unfortunate, but seemingly all Bourgeois Refugees, is a fact that turns its already Local Prefect of Police into more than his self- description as being ""a Poor, Corrupt Official."" As in any such degrading, seemingly hopeless situation, we see the heroic and the despicable side of humanity; one offering comfort and aid to those in need, the other feeding on their misery. <br/><br/>In contrast to those who would flee, we have those who fight to make things better, the ""Underground"" movement. They are in evidence in the city, and hail from everywhere in war-torn Europe. All it seems are present in ""Rick's"". <br/><br/>The initial important events of the story are revealed rapidly, which might leave on without the realization of their effect on the rest of the story. First, we see the Police Radio Operator and hear the All-Call bulletin reporting the murder and robbery of two German Couriers on board the Train from Oran to Casablanca. The other is the arrival of special German Envoy, Major Heinrich Strasser (Conrad Veidt) and his staff. The Double Homicide-Robbery was of interest, but mainly they are there to apprehend one Victor Laszlo ( Paul Henreid ), a fugitive from the Nazi Concentration Camps and Leader of the Czechoslovakian Underground.<br/><br/>The Stolen Documents, ""2 letters of transit, signed by General DeGaulle"", are given to Rick by the perpetrator, one Monsieur Ugarte (Peter Lorre). Ugarte is arrested and killed by either the Casablancan Police or by Major Strasser's men, it's not clear whom. From then on it's all a matter of hunting the Letters, evading the Nazis and trying to figure out just who is the most treacherous; Monsieur Renault (Claude Rains), the Police Captain or Signore Ferrari (Sydney Greenstreet),the self-proclaimed ""leader of all illegal activity in Casablanca.<br/><br/>We also learn that even those who are less than virtuous can be Heroic and even Patriotic. That applies to even ""just a poor corrupt Public Official"".<br/><br/>NOTE: * Boy, I've wanted to use that word ""GRAVITAS"" ever since all of those news pundits said that V.P. Dick Cheney had it. I think he's still got a touch of it!"
"pdeeley2006","10","2","5","21 January 2007"," My review
","Casablanca (1942) Michael Curtiz<br/><br/>In a bar fight, I'll take Rick Blaine as my wing man any day. Casablanca's leading character played by Humphrey Bogart is the stud I have always wanted to be. He is measured in his action, passionate without being strident, and his principled actions are imbued with tremendous courage. Even approaching the least savory of actions, the better angels of his nature win the battle.<br/><br/>Moreover, any man that can pretend to let Ingrid Bergman out of his sight is beyond my comprehension (I would have given the Oscar for that alone). There are only a few characters that I really which I was as cool as (not that I am cool to any degree right now); Rick Blaine is the alpha dog of that imaginary group.<br/><br/>The moral universe of Casablanca is one that I want to inhabit. The spirit of the law is adhered to, rather than the letter. Truth is valued over accuracy. And people seek to treat each other with respect and love that exceeds there own need to be comfortable.<br/><br/>If Casablanca is new to you, I think you will find it easy to watch and surprisingly contemporary in its editing. You'll likely learn where some of our cultures clichés come from (he never does actually say ""Play it again Sam"" and now you'll know where Bryan Singer got the title The Usual Suspects). In short, Casablanca is mandatory viewing for cultural citizenship in our beloved country.<br/><br/>MySpace.com/200WordCritic"

","""...a kiss is just a kiss, a siiiiigh is just a sigh...."" Ah, don't we just love ""Casablanca""? Is it not one of the best films of all time, perhaps even one of the greatest romances? The answer is, of course, yes. But why? Well, there are a number of factors to this. <br/><br/>The first will be the story. ""Casablanca"" has a fantastic script, filled with intelligence and quick dry wit. It is genuinely surprising as well, at least the first time you watch it. The twists and turns that Humphrey Bogart's character Rick goes through keep us on the edge of our seat.<br/><br/>The second factor to the greatness will be the backdrop. The war, although only serving as just a backdrop, plays an incredibly important part in the story. Some people might argue that Rick's involvement in the plot signal's the need for America to enter the war. It also gives us our villain - that of Strasser (Conrad Veidt), the Nazi General sent to arrest Laszlo (Paul Henreid). Although this no doubt dates the film a little, it still provides a fantastic atmosphere. Casablanca itself is a seedy world of scum and villainy (That sounds familiar...) and the many characters that inhabit it bring it to life vividly, from the pickpocket to the street seller.<br/><br/>The characters are the third reason why ""Casablanca"" is remembered so well. Rick, Ilsa (Ingrid Bergman), and Laszlo get drawn into the love triangle easily. Bogart and Bergman are superb, as is Claude Rains as Louis Renault, the head of police there whose lines are great comic relief when we get into the nitty gritty of the romance.<br/><br/>The one person we don't see enough of, I feel, is Sam (Dooley Wilson). For a character who seems to be regarded by Rick as a good friend, he disappears halfway through the film and is sold like slave labour along with the bar - one can only hope that he had a good rest of his life.<br/><br/>The last and most important reason as to why this film is so good is the ending. It's one of the most famous endings of all time - it has a surprise twist, a wonderful score, and then tension builds up as Strasser arrives to stop the plane to Lisbon. The ending also supplies us with perhaps some of the most parodied lines in film history - I'll leave that up to you whether you think this is a good thing or not.<br/><br/>By the way, although it is standard belief that no one ever says, ""Play it again, Sam"", I reckon that Rick does when he whispers to Sam the second time Ilsa and Laszlo arrive at the bar. I have a feeling Sam would know what he was on about somehow...<br/><br/>8/10"

","This film is one of the best classic pictures I have ever seen. An interesting story line and compelling performances are what I found so attractive about this movie. Kudos to Curtiz. The set was nearly perfect and was very convincing. I felt the heat of the Moroccan town as the camera swept through the markets in the streets. I was amazed to hear that this was shot almost entirely in a Hollywood studio. I wouldn't have noticed unless I was told otherwise. The song ""As Time Goes By"" was moving even to a former punk/grunge rocker like myself which says something for its power.<br/><br/>The topic is very interesting in that it deals with the mystery and intrigue of WWII and the efforts to defeat Nazi tyranny. A beautiful love story was also mixed in with the political refugee plot which held my interest for the entire length of the film. The dialogue was excellent, the best I've seen from the era. This picture was so well written and directed that it would have been great without big name actors and actresses but it was because of the big name cast that it has become the timeless classic that it is.<br/><br/>Humphrey Bogart as ""Rick"" was stellar in his performance. I believed the character to be a heart-broken man embittered and buried in self-pity all hidden under the mask of congeniality. This mask is rudely removed by a bottle of liquor. ""You played it for her you can play it for me!"" is only one memorable and dynamic line from this movie that launched the Bogart cult and mystique.<br/><br/>Ingrid Bergman as ""Ilsa"" was adorable. I could easily see why two men would both share a common love for her. I was enamored by her delivery and found myself sympathizing with both Rick and Lazlo for losing or almost losing her. This movie has sparked in me an interest for the work of Ingrid Bergman.<br/><br/>This was a film I would recommend for anyone who loves the cinema. It has truly lived up to its reputation as a dramatic film for the ages."

The setting of Morocco town Casablanca, where refugees fleeing the Nazis wait up to years to secure letters of transit to America, sees cold-hearted nightclub owner Rick Blaine (Humphrey Bogart) get involved in the wartime struggle when his old flame Ilse Lund (Ingrid Bergman) walks into his club on the arm of her husband Victor Laszlo (Paul Henreid), a sought-after resistance leader.  Blaine is in possession of two letters of transit, and Ilse and Lazslo persuade Blaine to hand them over, all the while eluding the attentions of the snake-like German Colonel Strasser (Conrad Veidt) and Captain Renault (Claude Rains), the duplicitious chief-of-police...<br/><br/>The script is a joy.  Not a word is wasted, and nearly every line is memorable.  The acting is excellent.  Bogart is well-cast as Rick, and Claude Rains enjoys himself as the jovial Captain Renault.  Ingrid Bergman is divinely beautiful and as a leading lady has an onscreen grace denied most of her modern contemporaries.  Paul Henreid acquits himself well as the honourable Laszlo.<br/><br/>The only problem with the story today is its political undertones, which implies that America is an isolationist state that should be more involved with world affairs.  That may have been true during World War II, but it isn't the case now.  The recent war on Iraq, along with a history of US interventionism, renders this part of the story dated and misguidedly patriotic.<br/><br/>Regardless, it is hard to find a film today as well-written and acted as ""Casablanca""."

","I have seen this enough times to have the same opinion every time, it could be a little better, nevertheless I did see this film featured in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, from Oscar winning director Michael Curtiz (The Adventures of Robin Hood, Mildred Pierce). Basically, set in World War II, many Europeans are trying to get into America to escape the threat of the Germans, but to do that they have to go to Casablanca, Morocco and get a visa. A hot spot in the town is Rick's Cafem run by American exile Rick Blaine (Oscar nominated Humphrey Bogart), who is shocked to see his past lover Ilsa Lund (Ingrib Bergman) walk into his place. He has a flashback about what he and Ilsa used to get up to when they were in love, and now she is married after running away to Paris. He has other problems however, Ugarte (Peter Lorre) has given him important transit letters, Nazi officer Major Strasser (Conrad Veidt) is snooping around, and police Captain Renault (Claude Rains) tries to make the Nazi happy detaining Czech underground leader Victor Laszlo (Paul Henreid). In the end, to save her husband's life, Rick forces Ilsa to board a plane leaving the country, the letters are given to the right people, and when Rick looked like he was going to be in trouble he was saved by his new friend. Also starring Sydney Greenstreet as Signor Ferrari, S.Z. Sakall as Carl, Madeleine Lebeau as Yvonne and Dooley Wilson as Sam. I personally think that this film is a little overrated, Bogart is really good, Bergman is beautiful and the supporting cast all do good too, and the score is great. My concern is that the only thing I will ever remember are the memorable catchphrases and little love story in amongst everything else which I find a little confusing and too political, but it's not a bad film at all, it is a classic wartime romantic drama to see. It won the Oscars for Best Writing, Screenplay and Best Picture, and it was nominated for Best Cinematography, Best Film Editing and Best Music for Max Steiner. It was on 100 Years, 100 Quotes at number 67 (""Of all the gin joints in all the towns in all the world, she walks into mine.""), number 43 (""We've always got Paris.""), number 32 (""Round up all the suspects.""), number 28 (""Play it, Sam.

","I found ""Casablanca"" to be pretty unentertaining, funny at moments(sometimes unintentionally), but not worthy of being called a movie classic. Hell no! It's just another movie where Bogart is trying to look like he's to cool for school, and Bergman isn't anything special either. The best moments come from Claude Rains as Captain Louis Renault and the best acting is played out by Paul Henreid. However, the story's what really sucks here. If that's really how people used to live half a century ago, then thank god for the 60's and the 70's. And if I'm is supposed to believe that in real life the love triangle would unfold as it does on the big screen or that Bergman just goes along with Bogart's last minute decision that she's in love with Victor Lazslo after all, leaving Bogie, the love of her life behind, well, then I'm offended. If that young couple just needed money to buy their way out of Casablanca, then why the hell didn't Bogart do the same. He was loaded. We're supposed to believe his character's background of being so terribly in love, experiencing a loss of that love, an over acted performance of going through pain when he rediscovers that love, yet in the final scene he doesn't show any sign of true heart break or any kind of pain. He decides he's going to cling to the past and let the love of his life, the only woman he ever loved and will ever love fly away forever. Pretty cheesy. But with some good one liners.     7/10"

It is simply a matter of differentiating what the public has made legendary and what actually works even today."
"jose-cruz53","5","3","11","29 September 2012"," I found it mediocre
","Set in the early 1940′s, when WW2 was ranging and the outcome of the conflict was still far from clear. Casablanca is the name of a town in the coast of North Africa that was a focal point in gathering people from all the countries involved in the war, from refugees from occupied France to Americans seeking to make out a living out of this growing consumer market generated by this focal point. The main character is an American that owns the most popular bar in the town, where ""the action happens"".<br/><br/>I found this movie to be rather boring and mediocre, it's a typical love story movie. Nothing special and is a film full of clichés. True, it is from 1942, which may not have been cliché at the time, and in fact may have become clichéd due to this film massive influence over the next decades on the rest of Hollywood. However, I am not interested in originality and influence here, but on the pleasure that I derived from viewing the film. Regarded by many as among the greatest films ever made, I found it completely mediocre. Maybe it is this high degree of mediocrity that allows to be so highly regarded. As something that pleases everyone is something that cannot be really great to anyone.<br/><br/>Anyway, I am not a great fan of very old films. I generally find them either clichéd and/or technically inferior to relatively more recent films (i.e. made in the 1960′s onwards). However, I found Citizen Kane, from 1941, to have been excellent. This, on the other hand, I found to be the definition of a mediocre cliché ridden film."

","I really didn't like the movie. I watch plenty of movies both new and old. <br/><br/>Its also not that i don't like oldies(really liked City lights, Roman Holiday, 12 angry Men) and i am huge fan of classics. But this was a really weird movie and I certainly dint get what the movie was all about. Boring to hell, very slow and lots of talk. Though i agree that acting was great, specially of the Rick character, actress was really beautiful and therefore I gave this movie a 5 rating or i would have been 1. <br/><br/>Maybe I don't have the correct vision for these type of movies so I couldn't get it. But still i would say, this movie sucks."
"wahn06","5","2","6","22 October 2017"," Highly Overrated Noisy Movie
","I believe this movie has been given a high rating because it is OLD! Otherwise, there is nothing much interesting in it. Acting is mediocre, music is just noise. Story/plot can be easily guessed. Only direction compensates a bit, for which I give this five stars. Not recommended. If it had been produced in today's movie world, it would have been in danger of being a B movie."

","I can see why everyone makes such a big deal about this movie because it has a little bit of everything and it has the predictable happy ending. The acting wasn't bad but I found it to be average of the time. The story wasn't bad either but was more extravagant than realistic. I'm bias against movies that take place in a foreign country though; for some reason I don't like them. Maybe I just don't understand different countries and different governments so I can't follow what goes on when I watch it in movies. But either way, I found it hard to relate to and just didn't enjoy watching it that much. I don't see it as one of the greatest movies of all time."
"The-Sarkologist","7","2","6","12 November 2011"," A Film-noir classic
","This is considered to be one of the greatest movies of all time. I loved this movie but I found that there is a lot of hype surrounding it. The hype does not say that the movie is better than it is, but rather tries to entice us to watch the movie when we don't need it. Casablanca can and does stand on its own. It is a movie that does not need advertising for if it appears on television people will watch it.<br/><br/>The year is 1942 and France has fallen to Nazi invaders. People are fleeing Europe to America to escape the war and it is only through Lisbon that they can do that. So they go from Paris to Marselle across the Mediterranean and then across the Sahara to Casablanca where they catch a plane to Lisbon. Casablanca thus becomes a refugee city and a haven of pirates and thieves and people desperate to get to Lisbon. The only way out is by plane which is controlled by the local police through the Nazis. Casablanca is called neutral territory but in reality the Nazis have a lot of control over the city.<br/><br/>The movie is based around a man named Rick (Humphery Bogart) who runs the Cafe Americain. He was a mercenary who fought for the Royals in the Spanish Civil War and ran guns into Ethiopia during the Italian invasion. He now sits in Casablanca, after fleeing France, remaining strictly neutral. The movie is about how Rick is pulled by both sides and the desire he has for a woman that is forbidden to him. A woman who he knew and lost in Paris and now returns with her husband. Rick is torn by anger and frustration with the woman that he loved who left him alone in Paris.<br/><br/>Rick struggles with the side that he is on. He is a successful business man but he remains aloof from his customers. His only friend is the piano player Sam (though the line ""Play it again Sam"" does not seem to appear in the movie). He has been emotionally hurt by this woman and because of this he cannot have any other relationships. Yet we see his character change when the woman appears. The chief of police notice this when Rick sits down and has a drink with her and Victor Laslow, the head of the resistance. Rick struggles with love and hatred for this woman to come to the end realising that his love for her means that he wants her to be happy and that is to have her leave with Victor. Even though he wants her, and suggests betraying Victor so that he might escape Casablanca with her, he realises that he cannot and sends her off in the airplane at the end (though the airplane scene at the end isn't as sad as people have made it out to be).<br/><br/>I don't think I need to say how great this movie is. It stands up on its own. It is a movie where the characters interact in a real way and grow and change. They have a solid background, one that rises up and brings them great pain when they face each other again. Casablanca is not as dark as the Maltese Falcon, yet it is a great movie and little more needs to be said."
"likesknives","7","2","6","25 February 2009"," Ignorance in Reviews
","I would like to say first that this movie is not super realistic or would I consider it the best of all time, but it is a very very good movie, despite some unrealistic factors, and I find it so ridiculous reading some of these comments from people who rate it with 1 star or something of the like who write about it as if they have never seen it. I read things such as ""Ilsa is seen almost jumping out of the plane to get to Rick"".. and i think ""did you actually watch the movie? or did you want to just say you didn't like it because everyone else does?"" You should really watch it before you write down comments about that make you seem like a child. Sure, some people don't like it because of the accents, the black and white, or for their reasons, but a lot of people do and you sound stupid talking about things that never happened in the movie. Black and white is okay in movies, there are a lot of good black and white movies, and a lot were made when colour was around but they wanted the effect of black and white. Directors and producers have their reasons, and the Casablanca would look stupid in colour anyways. Think before you talk because the people who like this movie, don't appreciate your useless aspects of a movie that you seem to know nothing about."
"onepotato2","8","2","6","26 May 2008"," Idealism behind cynicism
","When I first saw this as a young film snob, I liked it, and said it was important, but I didn't really know as much about human emotions, or the topics depicted as I thought. I found some scenes (the ones I was too young to understand) to slow it down; the ""morning after"" dialog at the bazaar, the sale of the club to Greenstreet. All I really knew was that the surprise ending was regarded as a sentimental powerhouse.<br/><br/>Now I find its storytelling structure to be so sleek and on-track that I seriously doubt the lore that says that pages of the script only arrived minutes before they had to be shot. It is a speedy, singular-minded machine that doesn't have an ounce of fat, that manages to be Bogart's best role and performance to boot.<br/><br/>Fans attend viewings to hear iconic lines within a context that ingeniously frames its well-known, pithy phrases in relation to selflessness, patriotism and sentiment. The electrifying smack-down of the Nazis delivered to 'Le Marseilles' is one of the most rousing moments ever put on film. And it's kept in good company by boatloads of other famous scenes.<br/><br/>It portrays patriotism in terms of idealism (not narrow-mindedness, victimization and/or hate) so even a liberal (the more idealistic of the two political viewpoints) can love it. This movie is a classic because it's an ennobling pleasure."

","Because anyone with even a small thinking brain will realize that Casablanca is one of the all time greats.

Are you an idiot or what. There were several sub plots and the main plot which was Lazlo's needing to escape to America to evade the Nazi's and continue his resistance work. How could you miss that unless you were too busy with you game boy or your computer to notice.<br/><br/>To MAITREG from Minnesota: Anything this silly would be laughed out of the theater and to video in a week.

And nothing is convincing???? Open up your eyes and ears and watch it again!!!<br/><br/>To SELFPARODY from the USA: It was not a story about WW2, it was a story about people in a time of crisis, and how they handled themselves during that crisis. You are a real dolt!!<br/><br/>To AVALEN1: ??????????????????? What are you babbling about. 60 plus years later and this flop of a movie is still finding new audiences. Will your childish 2 fast 2 furious be finding new audiences in 60 years??<br/><br/>To PLSJ from the USA: Next time you watch this movie you should turn off your IPod and your Game Boy and your computer and watch it with 100% of your attention.<br/><br/>To JAMES P.

Anyone can strip naked to get the guys and the lezzos into the theater.<br/><br/>To SPUD-48 from Idaho: The reason for the ""No Questions"" was to protect Ilsa from the Nazi's since if they knew she had a relationship with Lazlo they would try to use her to get to him!! Do you now understand??? Rick does not hide the letters while the spotlight is on him, he waits until it is moved and then slips them under the lid of the piano. The Nazi's can not arrest Lazlo in Morocco because they have no authority to do so. Only Capt. Renault can make that arrest, and he is content in knowing that Lazlo and Isla will never get out of Casablanca, and only does a reversal of sorts when Rick tricks them all into thinking HE will be going to Lisbon with Ilsa and leave Lazlo to rot in Casablanca. Renault basically switches sides when he lets Ilsa and Lazlo board the plane. That choice is cemented when he tells his deputies to ""round up the usual suspects"" after Rick shoots Strasser!<br/><br/>This is as far as I will go in this diatribe. I am sure the remaining 50 pages of commentary have more childish remarks like the ones I have taken to task above. They are all idiots too!"

","Casablanca is one of those films who's hype blinds people from giving their real opinion on it, because if you don't say it's one of the greatest then you can't be taken seriously.  I'll admit that I think it's a very good film with some very good performances and the romantic chemistry created by Bergman and Bogart is awesome, but being a massive Bergman Fan I've so far got 20 of her films and I wouldn't include Casablanca in her top 10. (Casablanca is in my opinion not as good as Gaslight, Notorious, Arch of Triumph, Under Capricorn, Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde, The Inn of the Sixth Happiness, Goodbye Again, Indiscreet, Joan of Arc, Voyage to Italy, Cactus Flower, Anastasia).  There are some great moments like when Bergman tells Sam `play it, Sam' then Bogart walks in.  The Paris flash back. The Le Marseillaise bit and of course the ending.  Bad acting by some of the support actors is the only real downer. Out of 10 I'd give it 8."

","Gone with the Wind, Citizen Kane,Brief Encounter and Rebel Without a Cause. All of these films are classics,but I don't think any of them can topple the legacy and transcendent beauty of the masterpiece that is Casablanca.
The terrific script works unbelievably well with Humphrey Bogart's character Rick, as he moves through life with cynicism and sarcasm. ""I don't stick my neck out for everybody""sums up the Rick we meet in the first quarter of the film.He is courteous to his customers,but for a mysterious reason he is only really concerned about himself and doesn't seem worried about others.Then,our queries are answered.Ingrid Bergman arrives,and it is then we understand the true reason behind Rick's underlying sadness and cynicism.As the film progresses,the audience experiences some of the best on screen chemistry ever seen;Bergman and Bogart are incredible together,in the few scenes they share,their emotions and love for each other is reflected extraordinary by the actors. The fantastic script merges in with their characters so well,as they toy and wonder where their love will take them. The supporting cast of Paul Henreid,Claude Rains and Peter Lorre provide terrific performances to shine with the two co-stars.Now,the ending. Most romance films often end with a conventional happy ending.Michael Curtiz and the Epsteins gave us so much more. As we hoped for Rick and Isla to reunite,Rick's sacrifice in the airport unfolded, and we realised that the ending is not so gloomy after. Rick's sacrifice of letting Isla go with Victor,was undeniably heartbreaking for Rick,yet his sacrifice to do the moral thing for the right cause internally left him redeemed and ultimately content that he did the right thing for his nation. The screenplay in this film is so magnificently woven together with the performances of the actors,iconic dialogue and soundtrack,that it firmly distinguishes itself as the greatest romance film that has graced our screens. It is simply the epitome of great cinema, a preeminent work that is perhaps the most phenomenal film to come out of the Golden Age of Hollywood."

The Acting (from Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman), as well as the Direction, Screen writing, Production, Editing, Cinematography, Musical Score and Art Direction/Set Decoration is all a Masterpiece of Cinematic Quality. There are techniques that Curtiz uses to pull off each and every scene, whether if it be the shadowing of Humphrey in one scene, or the usage of light for another scene with Ingrid. What is really striking about the film is how it holds up. The Filmmakers were in fact making another Hollywood Film, but in a different time.<br/><br/>The Second World War broke out. American was uncertain about their future and what was to become of it. Some have said that this film is considered as a propaganda film; which is slightly true with most Hollywood films. the point is that Casablanca is masterful in every aspect.

He uses certain Camera and lighting tricks to get the audiences involved with the moment of each scene. What is interesting is that we don't know this, but critics do.

The characters in Casablanca are so well played and well rounded that it would be hard not to build a bond to each of them by the end of the movie. Humphrey Bogart's role of Rick Blaine is my favorite character by far. His gritty attitude is accompanied by a softer side. The love triangle between Rick, Isla, and Victor really portray Rick's softer side when he ends up choosing to help Ilsa and Rick instead of himself.

He never falters or stumbles over his words. I also really like how he doesn't lie either, he has nothing to hide. But once the conversation switches to talk of politics, he politely but firmly excuses himself from the conversation, refusing to discuss politics at his café.

","We are often accused of being nostalgic, of irrationally defending the works and achievements of the past in detriment of keeping up with the times, accepting the changes as a natural part of life, a sign of evolution and growth. Take « Casablanca », for instance. The story is constantly placed at the top positions in specialized lists that name the best movies ever made. Michael Curtiz never managed to become one of the greatest directors of all times. Visually, « Casablanca » is not at all very different from many of the other movies made during its era. Can it really be so? Can it really be that in more than seventy years of movie-making ever since, few pictures can come close to claiming this spot?<br/><br/>Set in the title city, « Casablanca » centers itself on the story of Rick Blaine (a majestic and sombre Humphrey Bogart), a seemingly cold and cynic north-American bar owner living in the midst of World War II and who wants to state, above all, his political independence. Different nationalities find in the bar owned by Rick a meeting place to relax, listen to some music, or design escape plans to other destinations. Being able to leave Casablanca seems, to some, just a wish, and Rick's bar is the place where they can allow themselves to dream, or see their wishes of freedom crumble due to the prolongation of the wait.<br/><br/>Enter Ilsa Lund (the always perfect Ingrid Bergman) and her husband, the activist Victor Lazslo (played here by Paul Henreid). The reencounter between Ilsa and Rick brings back memories of a romance that has passed, a story that came to pieces on the same day the city of Paris fell to the Germans during the War. Romance and politics appear heavily interlinked, and start to expose that certain things may be beyond our control, that personal sacrifices may be called for when one faces the War.<br/><br/>« As Time Goes By » played by the pianist Sam (Dooley Wilson), the great friend of Ilsa and Rick, becomes a character in itself, larger than life, and reminds all of the characters that certain feelings do not change with time. The expressions in their faces reveals all of the feelings that they so strongly tried to suppress.<br/><br/>Rick, however, is the only alternative for Ilsa and Victor to reach safety. He will have to struggle between keeping his widely defended neutrality, recovering an old love or turn Lazslo in. The story delivers in every single aspect: it brings together politics, romance, betrayal, action, friendship and melancholia while exploring the historical context and presenting a magnificent story that certainly resisted the test of time. The script and dialogues are on point here - emotionally heartbreaking and exciting. <br/><br/>While certain movies can indeed be considered technically superior to « Casablanca », few have managed to conquer, snatch up and connect with the viewer as well as this one. Built with a fantastic cinematography work based on chiaroscuro and sublime close- ups, mythical scenarios and superb use of mise-en-scène, it adds something to every new viewing. The city of Paris becomes a place to represent dreams and heartbreaks and Casablanca a place where we may never want to leave."

","In the 80s, Casablanca's script was sent to a number of studios under the title ""Everybody Comes to Rick's"". It was almost unanimously rejected for being boring, dated, wordy and lacking sex.<br/><br/>What a boring, cheap world we live in.<br/><br/>Casablanca is a masterpiece of what can be achieved with the written word. It is no surprise that this won the Oscar for Adapted Screenplay, or that six of its lines are among the most memorable of all time. The words woven by Julius J. Epstein, Philip G. Epstein and Howard Koch from Murray Burnett and Joan Alison's glorious play are hypnotic in their beauty. That Casablanca is considered one of the greatest films of all time gives hope that dialogue driven films can be great once again.<br/><br/>Humphrey Bogart is Rick Blaine, a man driven to cynicism by heartbreak when he opened his heart to a woman for the first and last time. When the same woman (Ingrid Bergman) returns to his life with her husband in tow, complications arise - especially when he learns that the husband is a famed Czech resistance leader. Rick finds himself in a position to help them, exact revenge on the woman who broke his heart, or steal her away for himself. The word romance has been denigrated to the ""rom"" in ""romcom"" or to cover crap like 50 Shades of Grey these days, but Casablanca is a standing tribute to the word and what it means. Rick, Ilsa and Victor are all extremely relatable for the roles they play in this tale.<br/><br/>We believe every moment of Blaine's cynicism thanks to Bogart's commanding performance, and yet it feels completely natural when he shows himself to be a fine moral character. Paul Henreid is excellent as well - in one scene where a defiant Victor leads the room in patriotic French song to drown out drunken Nazi singing, it is impossible not to want to follow him. Bergman has little to do with her character but she does it well, while Claude Renains was my personal favourite as the unscrupulously corrupt Moroccan official Captain Renault. Each character has become an icon in their own right, and upon watching this film it is impossible not to see why.<br/><br/>The film is glorious in no small part thanks to Michael Curtiz's skilled direction. His swells the music where needed, the camera swims around effortlessly and the scenes are crafted to perfection. The recurring song ""As Time Goes By"" fits the film perfectly, and as we watch the final scene roll to a close its impossible not to be moved."

","""I like to think you killed a man. It's the Romantic in me."" muses Captain Renault as he tries to prise open the complex puzzle that is Rick Blaine. Claude Rains' role as the jovial and mild mannered captain of the police is often under-appreciated. He is the arbiter of the political tension in Rick's bar, with his profession of feigned neutrality that eventually becomes genuine empathy, even he succumbing to that same temptation of redemption that Bogart's character goes through. Casablanca is after all a romance, and like Captain Renault, many expected a romance. On the second time around, that ghostly stare of Rick and the nervous smile of Ilsa become laced with much more tension than the first time because our expectations of the film are no longer shackling us from believing of that sunset ending. <br/><br/>There's so much to be taken from the two lead's performances. Bogart is enigmatic is his first romantic role outside of his usual typecast. He portrays Rick with a sense of cynicism and disillusionment that speaks for itself; why else would a man remain in Casablanca, on the brink of invasion? We never find out why he has been barred from returning to America, nor do we get that fateful ending of the taking of the city, but we know from Bogart that Rick is man who sticks out his neck for nobody. Opposite him is the radiant Bergman, so often in the right of frame as she considered her left side the better of the two. Her beauty is enhanced by Edeson's used of a softening gauze filter and catch lighting to further add nuance to her character; each wayward glance, each subtle eye catch with Rick is full of humanity and tenderness. Bergman emotes so effortlessly that we can gaze into her gleaming or glistening eyes with ease and see scenes of Paris racing through her mind, and this is even before we witness that famous flashback with Steiner's stirring theme ushering us into a dreamlike memory (on a second viewing of course).<br/><br/>Last of the top billing is Paul Henreid as Victor Laszlo, the identified hero of the story. It's been often said that he is the weaker link of the acting, that perhaps his character is less substantial within the love story that Rick and Ilsa fleetingly have. But Laszlo is a vital piece of the film and the moral centre that drives the changes in our other characters. In that famous battle of the bands where a rousing round of La Marseillaise brings even the despairing Yvonne to tears, we admire Laszlo for his bravery and defiance but also Rick for his sly nod of approval. Wasn't this a man who only stuck out for himself? <br/><br/>Later, in a sub-plot that is nevertheless important and evocative, a woman from Bulgaria approaches him with obvious fear and apprehension. She is desperate to obtain exit visas for her and her husband and even subtly offers sexual favours in return. Rick is unable to disarm her intentions or convince her otherwise, but decides to help her in his own way: ""Have you tried 22 tonight?"" This little gesture not only points to Rick's changing sympathies but also tells us about other characters; see the gleeful reaction of Carl the waiter, or the observation of this act of goodwill by Renault. Casablanca is full of little moments that tell us lots about our characters. Ilsa arrives at night to plead with Rick for the papers that will grant their freedom away from the city. Rick refuses and when he turns back around, it's not an seductive open dress that we might expect from other films, but a gun pointed at his chest. Ilsa is so in denial she cannot afford a moment of weakness towards her former lover, so desperate for those papers. She admires Laszlo for his many deeds, but cannot say I love you in the same vein as the way she says it to Rick. <br/><br/>Despite it's troubled writing history, Casablanca has one of the finest scripts in film history. Curtiz's direction is impeccable and fully serves the narrative; there isn't a single shot that doesn't contain visual storytelling. An anguished Rick sits in his dim office, the chiaroscuro lighting illuminating his despair against the dark backdrop as the loyal Sam plays a simple rendition of As Time Goes By, leading into the score swelling as we fade into Paris. The Production Code of Hollywood at the time forbade an ending of Ilsa departing with Rick as it would depict a married woman leaving her husband, an immoral act. And how ironic that ruling turned out to be, because it's the self-sacrifice of Rick which ensures that magnificent ending. Love, after all, does not conquer everything. But we'll always have Paris."

","This is one of the greatest films of all time. There will be spoilers ahead: <br/><br/>I doubt that there's anything I can add about this film which hasn't been said before (and likely said better than I'll say it) but I'm going to throw mt two cents in the pot in any case.<br/><br/>There are many ways to comment on a film. One can discuss the storyline, summarize the plot, talk about the filming techniques/technical aspects or just say what you love about the film. It becomes both harder and easier when you're discussing one of the most widely seen films of all time.<br/><br/>You can watch the film and notice the clichés, but then you should remind yourself that most of those clichés are clichés because of this film. I choose to discuss some of the supporting cast in this review, because Humphrey Bogart, Ingrid Bergman, Paul Henreid, Sidney Greenstreet and Claude Rains have undoubtedly been justifiably praised to the skies enough already.<br/><br/>This film is peppered with supporting characters, some of whom have notably sized roles, like Peter Lorre as Ugarte, S.Z. Sakall as Carl, Leonid Kinsky as Sascha (the last two providing much of what comic relief there is in the film) John Qualen as Berger, Marcel Dalio as Emil and Conrad Veidt as Major Strasser, the serious heavy of the film.<br/><br/>Then there are bit characters-there's a pickpocket early in the film, there's Rick's girlfriend Yvonne (almost the only other female role of consequence in the film) and two married couples, an older couple who have a nice scene with Carl which is hilarious and a young couple, who are Bulgarians basically trapped in Casablanca without an exit visa. Their vignette permits the audience to see Rick's softer side and offers a nice bit of character development.<br/><br/>All of the characters here have their moments and the only performance which just misses the mark is Sakall's as Carl. For me, the scenery-chewing Sakall does here is just a bit too much to completely work for me. Even then, he still does a serviceable job.<br/><br/>Last, but by no means least, there's Sam, played by Dooley Wilson. Sam more properly belongs in the significant players with Bogart, Bergman and the rest, as he's probably been highly and frequently praised, as he should be. But I just had to say a few words about Wilson's performance as Sam. It's extraordinary. Most of Wilson's scenes are with Bogart and the two work together marvelously. The musical numbers Wilson performs are highlights of the film, particularly ""Knock On Wood"" and ""As Time Goes By"". Wilson's supporting performance makes the film stronger.<br/><br/>This film is available on DVD/Blu-Ray and is well worth watching. Most recommended."

Nothing bad, absolutely. This movie left one of the biggest mark in the history of cinematography. I just don't discuss about movies with people who didn't watch Casablanca. That movie is unavoidable.<br/><br/>I'm so sorry that Humphrey Bogart didn't won Oscar. He has a fantastic role, and he act that absolutely genius. On the other side is Ingrid Bergman who is gorgeous and selfish women. She is very good too.<br/><br/>The main action in movie begins like many movies, and i can bet that everyone expect that Rick will stay with Ilsa in the end. That buy me so much. Rick as a character showing us that no one can outwit him.

","Almost 75 years later and Casablanca still contends with the best of them. Movies you've seen in the past five years fade from memory while Casablanca will forever stick in your mind. It is the epitome of a classic and will never be outdated. <br/><br/>Casablanca tells the story of an American ex-pat night club owner, Rick Blaine (Humphrey Bogart), during the early days of World War II in unoccupied Africa. While following his usual tact of lying low his ex lover, Ilsa Lund (Ingrid Bergman), shows up at his gin joint in Casablanca with her current lover, underground leader Victor Laszlo (Paul Henreid). <br/><br/>The film expertly relays subtleties of the War and depicts the disarray that ensues following the appearance of two letters of transit. Nazi Major Henreich Strasser arrives in Casablanca for this reason following Lazlo and the police Captain Louis Renault (Claude Rains) does what he can please the Major but always looks to help himself. <br/><br/>Things escalate from here, and Casablanca continues to be one of the most memorable films to date. Skeptics see a release date of 1942 and a film that touts black and white cinematography. But for most this film will always be viewed as one of the best and considered timeless."

","I didn't like this movie as much as I thought I would. I was a little bit confused at times about who was who, what they wanted, where they were from, and where they wanted to go. Casablanca is about a man from America named Rick who owns a very popular nightclub in Casablanca, a town full of people from all over the place trying to get to America but it's not that easy because World War II was going on. The beginning of the movie involves the police rounding up suspects who might have possession of letters of transit because they were stolen after the murder of two German officials. The letters of transit allowed whoever had them to travel freely which would make it easy for whoever had them to get to America. Rick met a girl, Ilsa, while he was in Paris before he came to Casablanca who he really loved and she planned to run away with him but when Rick went to leave she was nowhere to be found. One night Ilsa and her husband showed up at Rick's café. He was shocked, he thought he would never see her again. Rick was tipped of that she was there when the piano player at his café started to play a song that he told him never to play but Ilsa requested it. Ilsa needs the letters to get to America but Rick didn't give them to her at first. She then held a gun to him and demanded he give her the letters and when she didn't shoot him she admitted that she still loved him and that when they meet in Paris she thought her husband died at a concentration camp. However, she found out he was actually alive and that was why she didn't go with Rick that morning and didn't give him any explanation. At the end, it seemed like Ilsa was going to stay with Rick but when they got to the airport Rick made her get on the plane with her husband even though she wanted to stay with him. He told her she would regret it if she didn't get on the plane so she eventually did but not before an officer got in the way and tried to stop them from boarding the plane. Rick shot him and Ilsa and her husband got on the plane. When the other police arrive, the officer who witnessed the shooting told them to round up the usual suspects in order to protect Rick from getting in trouble for shooting him. The end shows Rick walking away with the man who didn't turn him in and Rick saying the famous line of ""Louis, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship."" I didn't hate this movie but it definitely wasn't one of my favorites. The acting was great but I thought it was kind of boring and it didn't really change setting too much, the whole movie pretty much took place in Rick's café."

","Humphrey Bogart is the coolest actor ever. Sure there are actors that are better than him, but none have his spunk that only he can deliver. After first starting off with movies, the world fell for his bad guy gimmick and he changed his birth-date to Christmas to make himself seem nicer (or so I read). His breakout role was in the complex mystery The Maltese Falcon, where he plays cop, Sam Spade, with an edge. Every cop after has just been trying to match Spade in toughness and coolness. Casablanca was the role that really made his versatility grow and made him one of cinema's greatest heroes.<br/><br/>During this time, there was roughly a movie a week that was released. All of them blended in together very well and nobody really cared about Casablanca. It was based on a relatively unknown play and the actors treated this as if it was just another movie. Nobody knew this would stand the test of time and become more loved over the years. When Orson Welles made Citizen Kane, he knew it would become the best movie ever. The people in Casablanca could not say the same thing.<br/><br/>Casablanca is said to be the greatest film of all time more than any other. The only other movie that's a worthy contender as the best ever is Citizen Kane. The Godfather is also a good rival. But Casablanca is a nicer and more feel-good movie than Citizen Kane and The Godfather,but it has mostly been Citizen Kane and Casablanca that have been rivals since the beginning. Citizen Kane changed the way movies are made with unbeatable camera tricks and the best delivery of a life lesson ever, whereas Casablanca uses just great acting, a great story, and great dialogue. It is about a tough nigh club owner in Casablanca, Morocco named Rick (Bogart) who re-encounters his old flame (Bergman) with her war hero husband (Henreid) laying low. Rick is the only one with letters of transit that can help them escape, and only she can convince him to do it.<br/><br/>What makes a movie so good? It has to have good acting, a good script, a good look, great filming, be relatable and emotionally connecting. Casablanca has all of those, minus great filming techniques. What makes Casablanca so special? Awesome swing music a none swing fan would like; great acting by a star-studded ensemble; a wide variety of emotions such as comedy and excitement and drama; unbeatable and quotable dialogue, more than any other in film history; and the amount of love that's in this: he is willing to sacrifice himself for her, she wants to be with Rick, and Rick reawakens his love for her. This is raved as being the most romantic movie ever. There's crappy Zac Efron movies these days that are more romantic than this. But this has the best and most original love story ever.<br/><br/>Since Casablanca's release, there have been various copycats and adaptations of it, but none have ever been able to capture its magic. It is the best movie that did not rely on any special effects or filming usages.<br/><br/>4/4"

Humphrey Bogart plays the perfect leading role as Rick Blaine and Ingrid Bergman plays heartbreaker, Ilsa Lund.<br/><br/>While watching the film, you get a feeling that Rick Blaine is a cynical man, who holds little value and respect towards women. Maybe it's because his heart was broken after his lover betrays him in Paris, leaving him to wonder what went wrong with their relationship.<br/><br/>After leaving Paris, Rick opens up a casino/nightclub in Morocco during World War II. This night club is a refuge for those trying to escape German (Nazi) leadership.

I found it interesting that the film had a double meaning. One: it's a love story and a man who only wants to do what's best for him but later has a change of heart, Two: Humphrey Bogart is America and America is basically keeping to themselves and doesn't want to ""stick its neck out for no one."" It was great to see how it all played out. The plot/ story was great in itself, but the setting and layout of the film was great. There was one point when I felt like I was a patron in the saloon. I also notice how in the scenes when Rich (Bogart) was wearing white while everyone else had black on or gray.

","'Casablanca' was just another movie to those making it, one of 200 pictures that Warner Bros. released in 1942. In the decade before television, the major studios had a movie a week to get into theaters and so with that schedule one movie was just as important as another. 'Casablanca' was not expected to do well (or rather not nearly as well as it did) even though the cast was first rate – Humprey Bogart, Ingrid Bergman, Paul Henreid, Claude Rains, Peter Lorre and Sydney Greenstreet. It doesn't comfortably fit a genre, its plot is too complicated to put into an ad and, in the maelstrom of World War II, movies about the events overseas were a tough sell unless they had John Wayne or Gary Cooper blasting the Axis powers back to the Stone Age.<br/><br/>When it was released late in 1942 it quickly found audiences lined up around the block to see it. Part of its appeal I think was the timeliness of the subject. This was a time when Hitler's armies were spreading across Europe and a time when no one knew what the Nazis were going to do next. That uncertainty is present in the film. There is a desperation that is always present just beneath the surface of 'Casablanca', the pervasive dread of the Nazi death grip on the world.<br/><br/>The movie takes place in the tiny village of Casablanca in Northern Morocco, one of the last French occupied countries not in the grip of the Nazis. As the movie opens it has become a human traffic jam of refugees trying to get money and transport to Lisbon where they can catch a plane to America. Few opportunities arise to book such a passage so many find themselves stranded for days weeks and even months. At the center of this chaos is Casablanca's most popular nightspot Rick's Café Americain which is run by Rick Blaine (Humphrey Bogart) a man who remains steadfast at staying out of political affairs ('I stick my neck out for no one' he says).<br/><br/>One day he is given an order by police chief Louis Renault (Claude Rains) that a man wanted by the Reich is on his way to Casablanca and that Rick is to make sure that he stays in Casablanca. The man, Victor Lazlo (Paul Henreid), escaped a concentration camp and is now a major figure in the French resistance and his passage to Lisbon would be a bit detrimental to the Reich. Rick isn't interested but in the interest of humoring Renault he agrees. What he doesn't know is that Lazlo is currently married to Ilsa Lund (Ingrid Bergman), a woman that left Rick standing alone on a rainy train platform some years earlier with a Dear John letter soaking in his hand (this is part of the reason that he has retreated to Casablanca). He has held a deep resentment for years so naturally this reopens old wounds as Victor and Ilsa enter Rick's club and Rick grieves that 'Of all the gin joints in all the towns in all the world, she walks into mine'.<br/><br/>There is a legitimate reason that Ilsa left Rick and when she reveals it to him, he understands but she falls into a quandary. She loves Rick and can't bear to hurt him again but she loves Lazlo and she must she knows that he needs her now more than ever. Bergman's performance as the emotionally confused Ilsa is due in part to the fact that during filming she was never told which man she was going to end up with. She twists and turns with confused emotions and we never see her leaning one way or the other. When Rick tells her in the end that she is getting on the plane with Lazlo her face reveals confusion as she tries to comprehend it. The moment is very real. If she knew how the movie was going to end, I don't think that the subtleties of her performance would be as present.<br/><br/>Bogart, known at this point for his cold tough guy roles, showed a sensitive side here and hereafter is where he flourished as a leading man. As Rick, he is cold to those who come looking for a favor but in Ilsa's eyes he simply melts. This was a side of Bogart that was new to audiences and it changed his image for the rest of his career. This was his best performance so naturally he lost the Oscar to an unworthy contender Paul Lukas in 'Watch on the Rhine' (heard of it? Me neither?). Bogart would win the Oscar for 1951's 'The African Queen' continuing the academy's strange habit (after Cagney in 'Yankee Doodle Dandy and Gable in 'It Happened One Night) of giving Oscars to Hollywood tough guys for sensitive pussycat roles.<br/><br/>I greatly admire the screenwriters Julius and Philip Epstein and Howard Koch for their restraint. It must have been tempting to present the Nazis dominating the screen but the presence of too many might have lessened the credibility that Lazlo could escape. Also, it must have been so tempting in a movie with this much star power and this much emotion to supply an ending that would find Rick and Ilsa in each other's arms. That would have been a mistake. Rick's change of heart is the most important aspect of the film. He realizes that he must let her go in the interest of the greater good, that Lazlo, off on his mission, needs her now more than ever. The script allows the characters to follow their hearts rather than some kind of crowd pleasing convention. It took nerve to allow the characters to find the courage of their convictions, that the cause of stopping the Nazi's is far more important because they realize that their personal problems just 'don't amount to a hill of beans in this crazy world'."

","To begin with a review for what is considered a great movie of all time by many, I would say, ""Play it again, Sam"". The line is in the movie itself.<br/><br/>This movie is revered by many and indeed comes out as a great love story, but in fact apart from few minutes of a montage or a flashback, it never really revealed how they did fall in love, they here is the hero and the heroine. The protagonist, is apparently not a human here but they are the transit papers that drive the whole story and to get hold of them will be each character's will. Played extremely well by all the characters involved, the acting is a text book for many aspiring actors even today and shall be there forever. Ingrid Bergman as Ilsa Lund just paints the screen with her eyes, so well captured those eyes are that they made me desire for them and to have a faint touch of those to wipe those tears. This movie shall always be a tribute to her. Humphrey Bogart as Rick Blaine has done well and what I learnt from him was how to be expressionless and to derive an expressionless face also needs an extremely tough expression.<br/><br/>The writing is pretty accurate but the reasoning's are minimal, why a certain character behaves in a way is not completely revealed in the film. It is highly unconventional a love story for 1942 coz, Ilsa is seen kissing Rick many a time as he is the one she loves but is not by Victor Laszlo, the man whom she is married to and the man who loves Ilsa the most. That is an irony and brings an uncertainty to the way characters act. One scene where Ilsa and Rick are in Paris, embracing each other breaks up where they have to part and another scene turns up that Ilsa is manipulating Rick later to escape the country and even then she says that she loves Rick only. That is an inconsistency I observed but nevertheless, the story she reveals to Rick as to whom she was and what has actually happened to her makes up for it. But for today's viewers most scenes may seem like to have been cooked up and not so fluid and even I felt the same, the climax escape which Rick sets up is a bit truly altruistic and actually not very much appreciated by me. If I love a woman, she comes back I would rather stick with her then let her go again. My love is of prime importance to me but here, Rick has other plans so I did not like the climax much had it been the other way portraying a selfish human being as protagonist, surely the movie may not have received this much appreciation.<br/><br/>The music is excellent and the one song As Time Goes By is poignant and relevant to the movie narrative and even for normal reference. That is a high point apart from the acting of the film. The cinematography was simple and so are the settings which are mostly shot within studio.<br/><br/>So thus, I would say, this movie accounts as a great one by many and is loved by many more and I would love Ingrid play the role again and again too. But writing should have been tight and the characters should have been driven by selfishness rather than selflessness.<br/><br/>My Rating 3/5. A good one to watch for sure but not the greatest for me."

While the romance and sacrifice elements were present, the premises and outcome are totally different. In the early years of WWII, Rick (Humphrey Bogart) runs a very successful restaurant-cum-bar in Casablanca, neutral French territory where Europeans pay a fortune for exit papers to get to America. One day, his former lover Ilsa (Ingrid Bergman) appears, with her husband political activist Victor Laszlo. Rick and Ilsa had a whirlwind romance some years back in Paris but she disappeared on the day they were supposed to depart together, leaving only a note of apology and a devastated Rick.

When the young French girl that Rick's jilted realizes that a rebound liaison with a German SS officer is a futile and degrading gesture; when the Bulgarian newlywed is faced with the choice of betraying her husband to gain their freedom and Rick rigs the roulette wheel to save her from living a lie; when the French resistance operative is caught without papers and shot under the motto "" Liberté, Égalité, Fraternité"" (which sets the tone for the story); we are reminded that this type of intelligent screen-writing is very nearly a lost art. <br/><br/>This and two of Chaplin's talkies (The Great Dictator and M. Verdeux) caught the spirit of the world that was in the grips of real evil. But Casablanca hits all the moral/ethical hot topics. Would anyone still care about this film if Rick had run off with Ilsa? There were many films made during WWII that exploited the issues, but this one made it very personal on a lot of levels. The Epstein brothers earned that Oscar. Bogart should have gotten one as well. And it's traveled well. <br/><br/>If you don't have a gut-level reaction when Paul Henreid's character risks his life to urge the house band to play ""La Marseillaise"", check for a pulse, because you may have a fatal heart condition, mon ami.<br/><br/>Pull up a chair, and let Dooley Wilson (who had a long history in vaudeville and the theater with Orson Welles) take you away--the fundamental things apply..."

","It's up for debate whether or not this film holds up.<br/><br/>If forced to pick a side, I say it does.<br/><br/>The reason I can't commit to a hard and fast argument is because I've seen the film twice. Once in high school, six years ago.<br/><br/>The second occasion is yesterday night at the Music Box Theater in Chicago. The print is being screened as a promotion for the upcoming Turner Classic Movie Festival.<br/><br/>And the crowd is so eager to laugh at every minor joke, they completely overcompensate and ruin much of the movie.<br/><br/>The uproarious laughter is loud enough it stifles half the dialogue, and serves as a constant reminder we're in a theater. There are some who will give pre-emptive laughs, chuckling during the buildup and destroying any comedic timing.<br/><br/>I sure hope the devil reserves a special place in Hell for these people. But I guess I should talk about the movie at some point or another.<br/><br/>Casablanca is very good, especially considering it's release in 1943.<br/><br/>It is the epitome of a 'classic movie.' Yes, yes?<br/><br/>Humphrey Bogart as Rick Blaine and Claude Rains as Capt. Louis Renault steal the show in this film. It's a lot funnier than you might think.<br/><br/>There are lovable and despicable characters (which is always helpful) and dare I say it, some heartwarming moments.<br/><br/>In black and white! Can you believe it – kids in my Proverbial Audience?<br/><br/>(I'm prolific in the single-digit demographic.)<br/><br/>It's a film about cynicism and impression, and can be surprisingly upbeat. The narrative is truly exceptional, and the ending is more than satisfactory.<br/><br/>This might be the most misquoted piece in history. Nobody ever says, ""Play it again, Sam.""<br/><br/>I have no idea why that and, ""Badges? Badges? We don't need no stinking badges,"" from Blazing Saddles are so commonly misquoted. It's a rather strange phenomenon.<br/><br/>For some odd reason I thought Victor Laszlo was an antagonist, but I sure was wrong on that one. The role's played by Paul Henreid, and he's rather excellent as well. Peter Lorre, too, as Ugarte, is pretty great.<br/><br/>The hardest scene to swallow is his attempt to escape the police. The chase is a little silly.<br/><br/>What is it about Humphrey Bogart? Soon as I hear that brusque tone, I think, ""Gee I like this fella.""<br/><br/>Maybe it's him smoking that cigarette in the white jacket, or his ever-sustained calm.<br/><br/>He's a great protagonist. And the movie's a lot of fun.<br/><br/>I think you'll like Casablanca.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen it yet, check it out!"

","In my opinion this was a very well made film. Although I was not much intrigued with the plot following Rick Blaine and his attempts to help a former lover escape pre world war two Europe, I still found that other aspects of the film outweighed this shortcoming. The photography and cinematography are outstanding, especially during shots within Rick's Café. During these scenes, the use of contrast, hard, and soft lighting along with the visual effect of shadows stands out to the viewer. The director also creates a sense of realism within the café. The acting is also notable, especially that of Humphrey Bogart who plays the lead role of Rick. I would definitely recommend this film to anyone interested older films, despite the weak plot, the quality of movie making shines through."

All films renouncing Nazi terrorism tend to be highly respected, but this one is especially so. The music, both diegetic and nondiegetic, is beautiful and touching. The lighting is soft and fitting, and all of the characters who should be are rounded out well. Ingrid Bergman is unbelievably gorgeous, which makes it a little hard to concentrate on the witty, fast-paced dialogue she's involved in, but it's worth it. Humphrey Bogart portrays his supposedly cynical lead character perfectly. There are so many factors that make this the classic it is, and I don't think I could put my finger on all of them.<br/><br/>Overall, ""Casablanca"" is exactly what you would expect a film this reputable to be: beautiful and inspirational."

Set in Morocco, this film has a beautiful sense of composition and lighting, setting the stage for films to come. The characters are rich, and while not all of them are complex they are still a treat and do not feel trope-y.

The film was shot in black and white but, the characters were so colorful. The scenes have very low lighting and there was a very smoky look.

Also, the photography shots are really nice. There were lots of shots that could be useful for photography, like the side lighting, diffused lighting, and more.

Since then, I saw this masterpiece five or six times and every time I watched it, whether alone or with friends, I found something new, something different, something great... The brilliance of Casablanca is undisputed, and the Humprey Bogart's character, Rick Blaine -- the greatest ever. I mean, to do what he did... It's unbelievable! He is a definition of a great man.

","Casablanca---the beloved classic of love, sacrifice and usual-suspect roundups---is 71 years old. The movie could've started earning a pension 6 years ago, yet it endures. Somehow this picture never gets old. I think one big reason is its sense of humour about an ultra-sensitive situation. For all the Nazis and the talk of concentration camps, there's Claude Rains cracking wise with Humphrey Bogart. People love Bogie and Ingrid Bergman in Casablanca, but the real romance is between Rick and Louis. Beautiful friendship?

Even if you don't know much about Casablanca, you've heard 2 or 3 of the legendary quotes. That's not even taking into account how the AFI ranks ""As Time Goes By"" as the 2nd best movie song ever and the movie itself as the #1 romantic flick.<br/><br/>But this picture is so much more than high rankings on Top 100 lists and witty bon mots. You've got tension, drama, romance, witticisms, love songs, duelling national anthems, flashbacks, drinking, rigged gambling, and Nazi death. Good ol' Morocco.

"bkrauser-81-311064","9","1","2","23 October 2013"," The Most Accessible ""Greatest Film""
","In preparation to write a review for a film considered one of the best ever made, I read snippets of reviews and glanced though numerous history books looking for that crumb of objectivity that can excuse my love for the Hollywood film named after a Moroccan city. A semblance of greatness that can give even the most flippant a moment of pause and appreciation for the world created by director Michael Curtiz and cinematographer Arthur Edeson; populated by Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman.<br/><br/>Alas my mind and eyes are not as well trained as the myriad of critics, actors, directors and industry specialists who call Casablanca the end all be all. I can't convince the average film-goer that a black-and-white movie made and 1942 can change your life; even though I wish people would at least sit and watch it through just once.<br/><br/>All I can do is explain, in my own words, and through my own experiences why to me, Casablanca comfortably sits on my list of Best Movies ever made as well as any other list goodly enough to feature it.<br/><br/>Casablanca means so much too so many generations of people. During its initial run, its popularity was goaded by America's participation in WWII. Rick's changing of values and heart is the same change of character that American's faced i.e. one of isolationist, laissez-faire shruggery to one of sacrifice and honor.<br/><br/>The next generation of Americans enjoyed the TV boom which Casablanca was a universally prime choice for consumption. It was made almost entirely in a studio and its fine acting and episodic plot lines made it ideal for TV unlike say the large and majestic Lawrence of Arabia (1962) or the colorful animation of Disney. At one point in the 80's Casablanca was the most syndicated movie on television.<br/><br/>I first watched Casablanca on VHS around the age of seven or eight. My mother, always the movie musical buff sat me down around that age to watch Singin' in the Rain (1952), Hello Dolly! (1969) and The Sound of Music (1965). They were all magnificent and all in Technicolor. They were bright, funny and exuberant which is exactly what kids that age should be watching. Then she introduced me to Casablanca; a darker though still syrupy love story set in WWII. It wasn't like going from What Women Want (2000) to Eraserhead (1977) but it was a pretty big jolt for an eight-year-old.<br/><br/>Memory around that time is fuzzy but I believe Casablanca was my first full-featured black-and-white movie. I had seen the grittiness of 35mm black-and-white before while watching Frank Capra war shorts spliced with narration and veteran testimonials on the History Channel. Without that exposure Casablanca probably wouldn't have had such an impact; primarily because I'd be without context.<br/><br/>Did I like the film at first? Well I didn't dislike it. The memory of the story stuck with me until I saw it again a few years later, then again a few years after that. In fact over the course of my life time I must have seen Casablanca at least ten times; each time building a layer of understanding and subtext.<br/><br/>There is universality to Casablanca the shines through no matter who you are or how old you have become. Anyone willing to give it a try will at the very least will be entertained by it, if not moved by it. Surly one of the most accessible films pegged as one of the greats.<br/><br/>http://theyservepopcorninhell.blogspot.com/"
"StevePulaski","10","1","2","1 October 2013"," Worthy of a title so few films have
","NOTE: Casablanca begins my four-month long movie watching series simply titled ""Film Studies,"" where I provide reviews of all the films I have watched in my semester-long film studies class in my senior year of high school. Reviews will not be read aloud in class unless otherwise stated below, at the end of the review.<br/><br/>I've stated in previous reviews how difficult it is to review a film regarded as ""one of the best ever made"" or a classic because it would appear from constant analysis, its permanent mark in the minds of millions, and its loyal following that everything that could be said about the specific film has been said again and again. My thoughts on Casablanca aren't atypical or contrary to the public's consensus on the film. It's a bold picture with a lot layers and an engaging romance story all around.<br/><br/>The film concerns American expatriate Rick Blaine (Humphrey Bogart), who owns and operates a nightclub in Casablanca which has now been considered a haven for French refugees (""no one really lives in Casablanca,"" so the saying goes). People gather at this nightclub in hopes of purchasing ""letters of transit,"" which will allow refugees to leave the area and flock to America. One day, out of the blue, Victor Laszlo (Paul Henreid) and his wife Ilsa (Ingrid Bergman) show up to Rick's nightclub, much to Rick's surprise, as Ilsa is one of the only women he has ever fallen in love with. Ilsa, from the start, is a beautiful, almost angelic woman with incomparable charisma and beauty. Upon her return, Rick must question if he still has feelings for Ilsa, as does Ilsa, all while remembering that Victor does have the ability to get her to safety in America.<br/><br/>Like many films of its time, Casablanca was made, released, well-received but, at the time, thought of as just another drama made in the wake of another world war. It wasn't until the war ended that the popularity and the great reception of Casablanca began to flourish and expand before the film earned its place as one of the top American films ever made one of the reasons for this, I believe, is how many angles from which one can view this film. It can be seen as a morality tale, a romance (both which I find to be the strongest ways to see the film), an allegorical picture with Rick representing America's neutrality during the time of the war and Ilsa representing France as a country tempting to sway the U.S. in one particular direction, or as a period piece with only a handful of characters.<br/><br/>Moreover, I'm instantaneously reminded of one scene in particular whenever I think of Casablanca and its true emotional power that scene comes later in the film when the French national anthem is sung in a room full of refugees, many of them French, who authentically show emotion due to the entire scene being an act of improvisation. The shot of a young woman bawling in part nationalistic pride, part shock hits right in the soul.<br/><br/>Something must also be said about the black and white photography in the film, which is purely utilized to generate an effect and an emotion on the viewer. Consider the scene where Ilsa attempts to get through to a clearly weary and slightly drunk Rick. Director Michael Curtiz fixates the camera so that both characters can be seen, but the left corner of the screen, where Rick lies, is darker and bleaker than where Ilsa is, which is the top right part of the frame. In Ilsa's corner, it's brighter and the lighting alludes to a more optimistic feeling. This is a brilliant example of doing the difficult task of capturing two moods in one single shot.<br/><br/>Intricacies like that, the beautiful chemistry between Bogart and Bergman, the harsh morality at the center of it all, the controversial ending, and the immensity of emotions is why Casablanca is regarded as such a classic picture.<br/><br/>Starring: Humphrey Bogart, Ingrid Bergman, and Paul Henreid. Directed by: Michael Curtiz."

","A couple of years ago, romance used to be my least favoured genre for every film I'd seen until then had a predictable storyline, over-the-top melodrama, the same repeated idea of love & nothing much happened in them plot-wise throughout the runtime. The exceptions were too few but they were so because of reasons which had nothing to do with romance.<br/><br/>Not much has changed in the past two years but having come across some extraordinary films in that time, including 2013 releases like Richard Linklater's Before Midnight, Spike Jonze's Her & the Palme d'Or winner Blue Is the Warmest Color which made me see this genre with an entirely new perspective, I do have a new-found respect & appreciation for romantic movies.<br/><br/>Now Casablanca is a defined, engraved & universally embraced masterpiece. In my opinion, it too has a predictable storyline & some melodrama but then, it also has something that typical examples of its genre lack... and that's quality. Whether it's direction, writing, score, camera-work, cast, performances or narration, Casablanca writes a new chapter in each one of these departments.<br/><br/>Set in the titular city during World War II, the story of Casablanca concerns an American expatriate & former freedom fighter who now runs the most popular nightclub & gambling den in the city. Things are set in motion when his old flame arrives in town with her husband who's a renowned Czech Resistance leader wanted by the Nazi & asks for his help but he's got plans of his own.<br/><br/>Directed by Michael Curtiz, this one film engraved his name in the annals of cinema for it is expertly crafted from start to finish, is filled with memorable lines, introduces its characters wonderfully, is crisply photographed in black n white which provides a timeless sense to the story, is steadily paced throughout its 102 minutes of runtime & features a heartwarming, mesmerising & evocative score.<br/><br/>Coming to the performances, Casablanca has a pretty huge supporting cast but it's the top-billing of Humphrey Bogart & Ingrid Bergman who deliver the film's strongest performances. Bogart plays his role with effortless charm & has an infectious screen presence while the ever so beautiful Bergman leaves a lasting impression with a sensational work that's also the most memorable & finest work of her career.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, over 70 years have passed since this love story made its debut on the silver screen & yet, Casablanca has neither found an equal nor aged a day. Just like a good old wine, this timeless classic is only getting better & more profound as time goes by, continues to inspire & influence various works of romance even today, and it looks like it is going to remain a benchmark for its genre for a foreseeable future, if not eternity."

","As a child, I fondly remember watching the a Looney Tunes short which was a homage/parody to Casablanca, named Carrotblanca. I didn't think much of it, but it greatly gave me an idea of how iconic Casablanca was and knowing of Humphrey Bogart. Fast-forward to adulthood and now I've finally watched it and seen what the fuss was about.<br/><br/>Did it live up to the hype? I think so, but as I was watching it, I was starting to think I might not really like the movie by the time it ends. When things were getting too sentimental, my cynical side was cringing, but then once the story opened up more, I began to see that the story was addressing themes of love and virtue that we all can relate to as human beings. It's the two things that make a human being human and we as human beings know that those two things may require things of importance of us to be sacrificed and that can be either good or negative. It's a character study of one person's struggle with those two ideals.<br/><br/>What I love about Casablanca is that it is not at all cynical, but at the same time it's not all sunshine and rainbows. What it does have, most importantly, is a lot of heart and it is a film that can remind us all of our humanity in that we're all susceptible to our vulnerabilities to the people we cherish the most and that could potentially destroy us, but Casablanca finds triumph in that and asks each and everyone of us to find triumph in our adversities for the sake of keeping our hearts pure. Any film that asks something like that is a film that is sure to be remembered and to remain in the hearts of not only people looking for entertainment in movies, but also heart. And that is what makes Casablanca a pure classic, in my opinion."

","After going on Walt Disney World's Hollywood Studios ""The Great Movie Ride"" I knew that Casablanca needed to be next on my watch list. Perhaps one of the most beloved movies of all time, Michael Cortiz's ""Casablanca"" (1942) takes place during World War II in unoccupied Africa. Truly a timeless film, it has absolutely superb casting starting with Humphrey Bogart as Rick Blaine and Ingrid Bergman as Isla Lund. Filled with romance, personal tragedy and war, it covers anything any man or woman would want to see and stays with you for far longer than most movies. In my opinion, while it is an exceptionally well written show with dialog people are still quoting today, it is the acting that really makes it stand apart from others. It has a great story line but every single person involved with this film seems to have consumed themselves in a way that is not often found. They inhabit the role they are portraying and it just makes everything seem that much more real and that much easier to relate to!"

","I could quote more lines from this movie than many others without having seen it because of its popularity and importance to popular culture. Yet having seen it a second time I was drawn in more and appreciated the acting and cinematography of the film. I was particularly taken with Humphrey Bogart and the nonchalant Rick, such an American as most of the world sees us! Rains' Renault was also a treat, not to mention Sam. The superimposition of maps was a nice touch, and the contrasting darkness of most of the action in Casablanca against the idyllic glimpse we are given of Paris makes their love despite the short time together convincing. I was told a back story about the time this was made and how it tied to the US involvement in the war before watching the film, and this made the anthems scene quite poignant. Needless to say, it's clear why this is a classic."

","It has a very good story of a careless man always looking out for himself eventually finding purpose.Played by Humphrey Bogart who does an excellent job in his role. There are a lot of foreign actors in this film as well. It was a great way to portray the message the director was trying to get across which was that the world needed Americas help during the war. This movie although iconic and well known can have its true purpose easily looked over by a viewer today. But back when the film was made it had a huge impact on the views of the war. The sets for each scene are done very well even though most take place in the main characters night club. It has a bit of an eerie feeling added to it from the dim lighting which increase the suspense of the film and add a shady feeling to it. All in all a classic film that should be seen by every movie lover."

","Honestly the first time I saw this movie I didn't like it as much as most people did, and I just wasn't sure why. At the time I don't think I really got into the story like I had looked forward to, hearing so much about it. But the second time I felt a little better about it. There was a lot of qualities I learned to appreciate in this film, especially the political symbolism and the interesting character development, as well as the artistic perspective involving camera work and editing. I can understand why this is a classic, it is absolutely memorable and unique. I enjoyed the humor and I liked the interesting conflict. But it has definitely one of my most favorite endings."

","I normally do not enjoy romances, however, there are a few exceptions, and Casablanca is a major one. This film has to be the best romance that I have ever seen, and even when not looking at the romantic elements it still is a fantastically written and performed film. Humphrey Bogart is still one of the best actors to ever grace American film, and from my experience rarely had a performance that was less than stellar. The dialogue is expertly written, and the camera work and lighting make the viewer feel like that they are almost there with the actors, feeling what they feel. This movie is essential to see for anyone claiming to enjoy movies, and is the quintessential romance and drama."

","This was my second time seeing Casablanca, but this time I saw it to the fullest. It was a good movie! It had a lot of hidden details in it that could have been missed. The fact that everyone and everything is not what it seems to be was one of the messages. Also, doing the right thing and the best thing is not always the easiest thing to do. Which makes a lot of sense when the audience actually pays attention and thinks about that moral. The black and white aspect didn't bother once. The film was set to make a person believe that their imagination got the better of them and the film was in color. It was very interesting, to say the least. Casablanca is a film I'd recommend to another person, for sure!"

","I only heard of this movie before watching it, and I heard mixed reviews. The movie deserves to be played over and over again. You just don't see such quality in movies anymore. Movies like Casablance pertain to what was going on in the world at the time. It is one thing to just entertain, but quality entertainment is the best. Casablanca had a great cast and Bogurt absolutely made the movie. He gave Americans a tough guy look back in the 40's when this was released. He had a good sense for what was authentic and what was phooey. He also did a good job portraying what heartbreak is like for men. The way he tricked everyone but in the end saved the say for everyone and made some characters realize what they should represent. Overall, a great movie that deserves all the hype associated with it."

","Adam Roberts ENGL 110 MA 1 Kopplin Due 2/19/13 Casablanca<br/><br/>There was a time when movies did not have to be gory or intricately produced to score big at the box office. Though some will say that time has since passed, it is always nice to look back at how the modern movie scene came to be. Perhaps one of the finest movies of the mid-20th century exemplifying early movie styles is Michael Curtiz's Casablanca. If it were to be released today, many modern movie goers would shrug it off as ""old grandpa crap"". However, due in part to its portrayal of refugee lifestyle, direction, and unique take on current events, it cannot be argued that Casablanca has earned its place among the early classics.<br/><br/>The very thing that puts Casablanca in a unique position is its borrowing of the current state of political turmoil that existed in the early 1940s and making a side story to it. Many actors were refugees from Europe who had come to America to escape the German Reich. The cast features such top-notch actors as Ingrid Bergman, who plays the tender Ilsa, and the star Humphrey Bogart as Rick, a bitter and sarcastic club owner who can't quite let go of past love. It is clear from watching that every viewpoint is shared in the story; each refugee shares a different look on how the events of the time affected them. The mix of French, German, Austrian, American, Czech, Hungarian, and even Moroccan refugees adds a sort of cohesion to the movie; it is telling a tale of the 1940s human experience. <br/><br/>The setting of World War Two is quite honestly not the greatest setting for a love story, yet at the same time Curtiz sees a prime opportunity. The theme of sacrifice, one of the common ideas behind true love, is notably present in Bogart's character. Curtiz looks at the picture as a series of moral dilemmas that need solving one at a time, starting with Rick overcoming his disgust with Ilsa. It shows a passion for revealing a character's interior struggles one at a time. <br/><br/>Warner Brothers had a knack for mass producing movies during the Second World War to entertain citizens during a time of great emotional toil. Casablanca captures the attitude that many held during wartime, but wraps these views around the central plot of a love story. Love is hard to find in a war environment, and in the end Rick has to allow common sense to overtake his emotions, but in a way this is the greatest show of love in the entire film. <br/><br/>""Here's looking at you, kid"". It is one of the most recognizable quotes from a highly recognizable movie. In a time when everybody desires to get what they want when they want it, maybe some of us should examine what it means to sacrifice for the greater good."

","What can I say about ""Casablanca"" that hasn't already been said countless times before? The mere fact that a supposedly run-of-the-mill production like this somehow coalesced so exquisitely is nothing short of miraculous. What started out as a simple love story/wartime thriller ended up developing into a sublime blend of cinematic mastery.<br/><br/>The actors are a big part of the film's allure. Humphrey Bogart is simply 'the man' and his chemistry with Ingrid Bergman is legendary. They are perhaps the definitive screen couple, which might sound like hyperbole but I'm being completely serious. Meanwhile, the dashing Paul Henreid completes the love triangle and Claude Rains provides exceptional support as Captain Renault. As if that's not enough, the supporting cast also features such distinguished character actors as Peter Lorre & Sydney Greenstreet.<br/><br/>However, all of these considerable talents could have easily been wasted on a mediocre script. Thankfully, these actors were working from a crackerjack screenplay that was amazingly still being pieced together while shooting was in progress. Winning an Oscar must have been the furthest thing from anyone's mind. Yet the screenwriters not only won an Oscar for their efforts, they also introduced countless memorable (and enduring) quotes into popular culture.<br/><br/>The direction by Michael Curtiz is perhaps the only area of the film that's unexceptional. It's well handled, mind you, but I'd be lying if I said that it's at the same level as the performances, script, music, etc... Speaking of music, Dooley Wilson's rendition of ""As Time Goes By"" is nothing short of iconic and Max Steiner's score references it beautifully.<br/><br/>In the end, ""Casablanca"" surely must be considered a serious contender for the title of best American film of all time. Don't let the fact that it's considered one of filmdom's great romances dissuade you from seeing it, though. This is really one of those movies with something for everyone. There's romance, action, comedy and drama, all encapsulated in 102 minutes of cinematic bliss."

","Casablanca is a classic film that is very well known. Even before I had seen it, I knew it was very famous and said to be one of the greatest films in Hollywood. It was created during WWII and the plot is based on the oppression of one side and the heroism of the other. I would have to say that one of this films many strengths is its cast. Humphrey Bogart is amazing, as well as the rest of the cast. This film is filled with drama, humor, and romance all rolled in to one. The photography for this film was amazing as well, from the lighting to the editing, it was all done very well. This is definitely one of the greatest films of all time."

","There isn't much that hasn't already been said about ""Casablanca"". The movie is one of the all-time greats and for good reason. It not only redefines the classic love story but also provides a riveting plot with a truly blockbuster cast. The generally low lighting in the whole of the film really captures the dark, heartbroken, and lonely life of the stoic-faced bar/club owner Rick (Bogart). There is never a dull point in the plot and the characters provide memorable dialogue with flashbacks providing background details of their pasts throughout. A beautiful set and tremendous camera-work round out the other great points of what is arguably the greatest movie of all time. Easily one of the best movies to watch for those who want to experience a real classic."

","What can you really say to describe such a perfect classic movie? If you have to watch one movie from this era, my recommendation would always be Casablanca. It has romance, politics, comedy, action, drama... everyone can find something about this movie to like. Except maybe horror movie fanatics. Bergman and Bogart give fantastic performances and there's a chemistry between them that really makes the lost romance believable.<br/><br/>The movie is meant as a commentary on America joining WWII, set just before Pearl Harbor and would have been extremely relevant and emotional for the first audiences. As a modern viewer, it's not emotional in the same ways, because we are separated from the political conflict of entering WWII, but in the time period, even the cast was emotional during the singing of the national anthems."

It was great to find out just how many people he really would help in times of need. The way he would let people win in roulette was great. Michael Curtiz did a great job of having the audience feel as though they were at Casablanca at the time, that was done by great acting as well as scenery necessary to get the job done. Ingrid Bergman did an excellent job as well, her facial expressions and the way she spoke, she fit the role perfectly. She had an innocent tone to her voice which created more of a dramatic sequence to every scene she was in, it gave the sad and happy pieces to the film an extra boost of emotion which was great."

","When I first heard of this movie I thought I was not going to like it because of how popular it is. I was mistaken, I can now see that it is popular for very good reason.<br/><br/>This is the first movie I have ever seen Humphrey Bogart in and I was impressed. His nonchalant, yet bad ass attitude makes him an amazing actor to watch. He perfectly represents the United States at the time that this movie took place.<br/><br/>But the best thing about this movie is the writing, every sentence of dialogue is a work of art and the actors delivering them clearly respect those works of art."
"callirose102","9","1","2","27 September 2011"," Social and Emotional Relevance
","Casablanca has long been referred to as one of ""The greatest movies of all time."" With the help of an awe-inspiring cast, this film directed by Michael Curtiz really strikes a chord in the hearts of the American people. In my opinion, this is for two reasons; its social relevance and emotional, relatable characters.<br/><br/>Casablanca was filmed during a period of political indecision. At this time, America was struggling in its decision to enter WWII, and I believe it was Warner Bros. intention to stir the American public to action. Rick's slow build up to Ilsa's reluctant hero is a strong representation of America's decision to uphold those virtues our country holds dear: Courage, justice, and sacrifice. This rings especially true in today's post 9/11 society, which, like the attack on Pearl Harbor, ignited our decision to enter the war.<br/><br/>It is easy for people to see pieces of themselves reflected in the emotional struggle of Rick and Ilsa. I believe most men can relate to the stoic, jaded, yet innately sensitive rogue that Humphrey Bogart portrays. Likewise, Ingrid Bergman represents a noble woman of conviction, who gives her whole heart to those she loves. I cannot think of another actor in the same era who could deliver the level of performance displayed by Ingrid Bergman. Everyone who has ever loved and lost feels the tear she sheds during ""As time goes by"". The sacrificial love of Rick and Ilsa is that of which any romantic would claim to aspire to.<br/><br/>Overall, I do not find it surprising that Casablanca is movie that has stood the test of time, and it is my belief that its popularity will never die."

","To the director Curtiz you did an amazing job on this film Casablanca. The story written is just unique and i absolutely enjoyed the film. i like all the turns in the film, have you thinking one thing and then before you know it something else happens that catches you off guard. i do a good job of seeing how films are going to turn out but with this one i couldn't. the storytelling was off the charts, the rising action and climax. the actors did a really good job as well, i just loved everything about this film. it was a true story that could really happen to anyone. i liked how you used the WWII with it too. this film relates to me in a way that i understand. its hard trusting people, you cant jump to conclusions. i learned that in this film, it really stood out to me because Rick had all the right in the world to feel what he felt about Ilsa. Ilsa had no excuse and i was agreeing with Rick. but after she told the story about what happened and why she wasn't on the train it made a lot of sense, and i understand why. man once again i just commend you on this film. you turned a negative into a positive, I'm sure people loved watching this to take their mind off the current situation that was going on. smart move. this was all about sacrifice and you will do dang near anything for the people you love. i really respect Rick for what he did, at first he was all about himself but at the end of the movie saved a lot of people. he was considerate of not only himself but of other people as well.

"pontifikator","Null","1","2","18 September 2011"," One of my 3 all-time faves
","This is the best movie I've ever seen, ranking as one of my three all-time favorites.* Bogart and Bergman are pitch-perfect in their roles, Rains is debonair and corrupt, Veidt is snakely and villainous as he should be, and Henreid is forgettable, but who cares? We even get Sidney Greenstreet and Peter Lorre, along with S.Z. Sakall.<br/><br/>The typical movie is boy meets girls, boy loses girl, boy gets her back. In this version, Rick has already lost Ilsa, he gets her back, then he gives her up for the greater glory of France. Well, okay not France but for democracy and all that's decent. The dialogue is excellent with more memorable lines in each minute than most other movies generate in the whole show.<br/><br/>Sigh - they all come rushing back: ""Round up the usual suspects!"" ""Oh, he's just like any other man, only more so."" ""'I came to Casablanca for the waters.' 'It's a desert - there are no waters.' 'I was misinformed.'"" ""Louis, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship.""<br/><br/>The movie presents Rick as a cynical egoist, interested only in preserving himself. But we learn from his dossier that he's been involved with freedom fighters in several countries, then we learn of Ilsa. We decide that Rick is a cynic because she broke his heart, and he thinks he was a sap. Cynicism is a shell. Ilsa walks into his gin joint and back into his life, and Rick's shell thickens before our eyes. Of course, as the movie goes on, we see his shell melt away, and Rick emerges as the hero we knew was hidden deep inside all along. <br/><br/>The dialogue is excellent, and so is the directing (Michael Curtiz). ""Casablanca"" is full of minor characters who add to the richness of the world Rick lives in, adding depth that his character hides. Through his interactions with them, their affection for him and his gruffness toward them, we see his cynicism for the shell it is. Inside that steel exterior beats a heart of concrete.<br/><br/>The ending is superb, melodramatic, and heartbreaking without being maudlin and tearjerking. Noble, but not overdone, maintaining the breeziness and snappy dialogue in the face of Nazi jackboots. (Okay, so jackboots don't have faces, but you get the point, see.)<br/><br/>Everything works. It all comes together and stays together throughout the whole movie.<br/><br/>*I call ""Casablanca"" a movie because it's a great romantic movie about a guy and a girl. I call ""The Dresser"" a film because it's about marvelous characters, and we get to watch their development during the film; ""The Dresser"" is art on a high level. ""The Princess Bride"" -- I dunno where it fits. It's just my favorite fantasy epic swashbuckler that rises so far above whatever genre it is that it doesn't fit anywhere."

","I had always heard that Casablanca was one of the greatest movies of all time. However, anytime I had seen a movie that had received such high praise, such as Citizen Kane, I was disappointed. Maybe my expectations for Casablanca were lower because of that, or maybe because for some reason I always assumed it was nothing more than a girly film, but the movie far exceeded my expectations, and I must agree that it is one of the greatest films of all time.<br/><br/>The movie is so much more than a love story. Elements of suspense and conflict between good and evil make this story work. Bogart's character is even a social commentary on American isolationism, and what good can be achieved when he opens his heart and sticks his neck out for someone.<br/><br/>The dialog is not only brilliant, but masterfully delivered by Bogart and Rains. I think Rains performance is highly underrated, and my favorite in the film. <br/><br/>This is a must see for everyone, especially for people like me who think it will be nothing but a romance movie."
"mhonorsenglish","10","1","2","5 April 2011"," One of the greatest movies ever made
","This film is clearly one of the greatest of all time. It's genius lies in the perfectly delivered emotions of the actors. After years of playing gangsters and tough guys, Humphrey Bogart used Casablanca to establish himself as romantic lead, and cemented his place as one of the best actors of all time. He plays Rick Blaine, the bitter saloon keeper with a heart of gold, still madly in love with the one who got away. When she shows up in Casablanca, the passion between them reignites, but he learns that she is married to one of Nazi Germany's greatest enemies.<br/><br/>Ingrid Bergman acts as Ilsa Lund, the wife of Victor Laszlo, an escaped enemy of the Third Reich. She arrives trying to find a way out of Casablanca, but meets Rick, and is torn between the two. In the end, both realize that they must sacrifice each other for the fight against the Nazis.<br/><br/>The writing in Casablanca is superb. Many of the lines, ""Here's looking at you, kid"" or ""We'll always have Paris"" have become legendary. Casablanca holds the distinction of having the most quotes on the AFI's top 100 quotes list. The writing perfectly conveys the emotion and tension between these two characters, as well as the supporting actors.<br/><br/>Many of cinema's most famous scenes are in Casablanca, including arguably the greatest scene of all time, the airport scene. In the final scene, Rick, Ilsa, Lazslo and Renault arrive at the fog-covered airport. Rick knows he and Ilsa love each other, but realize that in the end, they can never be together. He convinces her to join her husband and continue the fight. In the end, she agrees, and the two lovers part, assumingly, never to meet again.<br/><br/>Casablanca stands as one of the greatest movies of all time simply because of the raw pure emotion that these actors brilliantly convey, a love that is real and true, but a love that can never be."
"tinyredspoons","8","1","2","25 March 2011"," Refresing take on an old theme
","Casablanca is a refreshing deviation from the usual romantic drivel that Hollywood now produces. This is probably because more than anything it was a propaganda piece urging America to enter the war. This is most apparent in the last scene when Humphrey Bogart tells the ""love of his life,"" that them being together is unimportant in the grand scheme of things, that there are much more important forces at work. Tha they must embrace the cause they believe in, and go their separate ways. Quite a different approach when looking at films now, where feelings and love are all encompassing and one's duty in the face of adversity should take back seat to falling in love."

To see a character so stoic and unemotional and then to know that a single woman is able to break him down to nothing is so groundbreaking to the mind. Beside the amazing acting, my other favorite aspect of this movie is the lighting. The lighting on this set of this movie was so moving, that it was hard to tell that they were trying to tell the emotional and romantic story with just the lighting. For example, the brighter lighting was reserved for when we saw Rick and Isla in France when they were happy and in love. The darker lighting was reserved for when Rick is alone without Isla and especially when he was alone and drinking the night she came back into his life. The lighting also told Rick's mental state as well. Such an amazing movie and deserving of every award given to it."

Of course the story, plot, and characters are also very well done, but in my opinion it is the presentation of everything that really grabs your attention. i'm sure this film was substantially more powerful at the time it was released during the war, but today one can still feel the struggles of the time period in this movie. i really enjoyed all the humor that is tucked in to such a serious subject it takes the edge off."

Although I'm not one of those people that feels Casablanca is the best film ever made, it is enjoyable. The quality I liked most about this film was its ability to suck me in, although I must admit there where parts where I got lost a little bit.There's a lot going on this movie, World War 2, the running of his club, double crossing, and of course you cant forget the ultimate love story. for being a movie thats older, well not from my generation,i didn't find the dialog to be overly cheesy.The ending of this movie is pretty awesome.I like that you think you know whats going to happen but you don't, (at the airport situation, who gets blame etc).There's also some great cinematography in Casablanca. The use of lighting to set up shots for the camera is magnificent. They also tend to focus on a searchlight in the movie as well.The actors in Casablanca are just magnificent, they really add a certain well, realistic element, for lack of a better term. Humphrey Bogart is enjoyable as usual. I've only seen a few of his films, but this is my favorite by far. He does such a good job of keeping his character in line, invulnerable and cold at times, but heartfelt at others. now i can really understand the line ""of all the jin joints in all the world."""

Then she wanted to go to America with Rick, but Rick makes her stay with her husband. For the story of the movie I believe this works.

","""Leave him alone, Miss Ilsa. You're bad luck to him.""<br/><br/>There's not much I can say about Casablanca that hasn't already been said countless times in the sixty-eight years since it was released. The story about a chance meeting of former lovers in French Morocco during World War II is as classic as any movie can possibly be. It's endlessly quoted and nearly universally beloved, and my opinion after seeing it doesn't differ from popular opinion. This is a fantastic movie.<br/><br/>If not for Grace Kelly, Ingrid Bergman would be my favorite classic actress of all time. Stunningly beautiful and as talented of an actress as there ever was, she's the heart of this movie to me, even more than the central character, played by Humphery Bogart. Casablanca is my introduction to him, and he gives an expert performance of a brooding, bitter man with a past that's covered his true soul with cynicism. His character was layered and complex, and he delivered the amazing dialogue expertly. Paul Henreid and Claude Rains were also excellent in their roles, with special mention going to Dooley Wilson, who has probably the best role of any black actor that I've seen from that film era.<br/><br/>You see old movie trailers describing their respective films with bold proclamations of ""Danger!"", ""Intrigue!"", ""Mystery!"", and ""Romance!"", and those all are perfect descriptors of Casablanca. It just feels like a film that was made to endure across the ages. The music is brilliant, I've already mentioned the acting, the characters are memorable, and the story hooks you with mystery and delivers an ending that couldn't be more perfect. Seeing Casablanca should be mandatory for every movie fan, it deserves all the critical and fan acclaim and every award it's ever gotten, and more."

","I still have so many great classics I've yet to see, but after catching this on TCM recently I can see why Casablanca is so highly regarded. The dialog in this film blows so many modern films out of the water, being at the same time witty, in some cases laugh out loud funny, and powerful. It's amazing how many of its iconic lines have become permanently engraved in film history. This is only the third film I've seen of Bogart's but he continues to impress each time. His delivery of each quick witted remark keeps a permanent grin on your face and he plays the hard boiled ""cool guy"" with a heart of gold and a sketchy past flawlessly. I hope classics like this are not lost to my generation brought up on Micheal Bay and torture porn."

","SPOILER ALERT! This film is over a half-century old. If you have not yet seen it, do not read the following review.<br/><br/>I cherish this film. There are films I love, but I cherish Casablanca. The premise of the film is about doing the right thing. Fighting the Nazis, giving up your one true love, making sacrifices, etc. How can a person not identify with such a film? The dialogue is priceless, many of the phrases and lines have made it into our common speech. There was even a movie made called ""The Usual Suspects"". How many films have had a whole film made, from a line in the film? And my all-time favorite line, is when Captain Renault tells Rick to be kind to women ""Someday, they may be scarce""! I must say I cringed when I learned that there was a ""colorized"" version of this film released in Australia. This film must be seen in monochrome. The issues, love/jealousy, and freedom/tyranny are black-and-white issues.<br/><br/>The ""battle of the anthems"" scene, is one of the most powerful scenes ever committed to film. The band strikes up ""La Marsellaise"", and the people sing it with fervor. Many of the actors, had recently escaped from Europe, and they cried real tears. I always weep profusely, when I see this part of the film.<br/><br/>One of my pastimes is hookah smoking. This film is one of the very few films ever made, which show a smoldering hookah. Every time I smoke a hookah, I channel ""Casablanca"".<br/><br/>I am delighted that the AFI voted ""Casablanca"", as the #2 all-time greatest film of the past 100 years. It deserves the honor."

","This film has elements of any great film, romance, action and suspense. The cast is just wonderful and they fit so well together. Humphrey Bogart plays Rick so well changing from the reserved night club owner into a man in love and willing to risk everything. Peter Lorre who is a fabulous character actor plays Ugarte so well, his character is endearing in a way but a the same time you are always worried what his next move will be in fear that it will endanger the characters. The slow build up of the suspense between the German soldiers and the patrons of the night club makes this movie one that you can't take your eyes off of. From the beginning scene in which Ugarte tells Rick that he has the transit papers I was on the edge of my seat. The scene in which Rick allows the French to sing their national anthem while the German soldiers are singing theirs is one of absolute triumph. The lighting throughout the film mimicked the feelings of the characters. During the scene in which there is tenderness between Rick and Illsa the lighting is soft and seems to frame their faces but in the scenes with suspense the lighting is much darker. It is no wonder that this film has gone down in history it is remarkable."

","This classic love story really delivers. I may even venture so far as to say it is the best romantic movie of all time. Humphrey Bogart's acting is once again phenomenal. He delivers his lines soÂ…coolly. He is very suave and is equally matched by Ingrid Bergman. They have so much on screen chemistry. The flashbacks to Paris add to the whole romance. The audience gets the treat to see their love come full circle. Their final moments together rip your heart to shreds. However, even if you are not into romance as a genre, there is still something to be gained in ""Casablanca"".<br/><br/>Curtiz's direction is understated and subtle, but that is one of the movie's strong suits. He doesn't let his personal style and need to creatively express himself overpower the plot and take away from the movie. Curtiz's direction adds to the movie and compliments it beautifully. Furthermore, the screenplay is the second cherry on top when it comes to the production.<br/><br/>The scene where the national anthems are dueling each other is powerful. The story is strong because it is about the war but also not about the war at the same time. ""Casablanca"" instead focuses on people indirectly involved in the war and how this moment in history shapes them.<br/><br/>""Casablanca"" is all-in-all a very well crafted movie. A must see."
"jmzalanka","Null","1","2","28 November 2009"," Blaine Makes A Decision Under Duress
","When Rick Blaine decides to put Victor and Ilsa on the Lisbon plane instead of going with Ilsa himself is problematic. That decision is the key piece of the film. Whatever happened before didn't matter and the outcome had not yet been revealed. The decision probably comes sometime after Ilsa confronts Richard with a variety of offers for the letters of transit alone in his apartment. The offers included appeals to patriotism and friendship, and when that failed, sex. Ilsa decided to stay with Rick. Ilsa's decision frees Lazlo to leave Morroco and the threat of German reprisal, capture, and execution. Ilsa is a confused woman and a human being in a hard situation. What would you do? Is Ilsa's decision right or moral? Her heart is a dark forest and I fear her wolves had gotten her down. I do not believe Ilsa could think straight in Blaine's arms which is where she ended up begging for the letters of transit. Just when Rick decided to cut his ties with Ilsa puzzles me. It happened some time during the night. The wonder of the film is how someone can make a smart and doubly painful decision in hurricane of emotions. Rick's decision will cut him off from Ilsa a second time. Rick predicted sorrow when Ilsa would begin regretting her decision to stay with Rick. To Rick's great credit, he could see just a little bit ahead despite the emotions Ilsa brought out in Rick. How and where does Blaine identify and come to such a decisive moment? The answer is in the film somewhere. I keep looking for it. Blaine will think about Ilso every day. He's traded one torture for another. But at least Ilsa will be safe. Blaine is my guy. How did you do it Rick? And I see you are still standing. I bet it hurts like hell. Here's looking at you.<br/><br/>I've seen Blaine referred to as a soldier of fortune. That probably referenced the line that Blaine fought in the Spanish Civil War. Those Americans in that war were generally not soldier of fortune types, mercs. They were idealistic volunteers, thrown into the front lines. They died in droves. The Americans fought together in the 15th International Brigade in Spain. Them that got out would have become cynical, defeated, and convinced that they would not stick their necks out for someone."

","I first tried to watch this film a few years ago and shut it off because I thought it was extremely boring and slow. When I saw it in full this time around I must say I regret that it took me this long to finally watch it. Even though its kind of a ""cheesy love story chick flick"" I thought it was a great movie. It was fairly simple and easy to understand, whatever action sequences no matter how small were good, the filming was great, there was a good balance of light and dark and finally the characters and acting was phenomenal. Everyone was so good although I do think Humphrey was the best. I was surprised at the end of the movie when Rick didn't get the girl and that he didn't act selfish for once and let her go I really thought they were going to end up together but oh well what can you do maybe that's why some people love this movie so much. 8 stars a must see."
"baddman316","Null","1","2","1 November 2009"," Casablanca review
","Casablanca is said to be the most popular film. It is maybe the most quoted film as well. One of the film's well-known lines, ""Here's lookin' at you, kid,"" was not in the original draft but was actually added in as the result of Bogart and Bergman's poker playing between takes. So with that said, that line became famous and maybe probably quoted to this very day! The movie is one that I would recommend to others. Its scope is simply amazing and it plays an incredible melodrama. Casablanca is all about sacrifices and about the good that human beings can do. Some say it is a sappy love story but it really isn't, even though some of the notions in the film are relatively romantic."
"elshikh4","10","1","2","26 October 2009"," Falling in Love With a Movie !
","OK, there are some movies that you love nearly every bit of them. Back to the Future, E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, The Guns of Navarone, Annie Hall are few from my list. Casablanca maybe comes before all. It is pretty hard to say what's great in it, but anyway, let me elaborate from my heart on that.<br/><br/>""A franc for your thoughts""<br/><br/>I love humming birds, the taste of Mulukhiyah, the winter afternoon, seeing Marilyn Monroe and this movie. There is Ingrid Bergman loving Humphrey Bogart while the music of ""You Must Remember This"" is on, so who needs more?!<br/><br/>""It seems that destiny is taking a hand""<br/><br/>It is my only time, yet, to watch one movie for more than 20 times (consecutively). Since the first meeting, February 1998, I'm crazy in love. I recorded the dialogue on a tape to listen to it for endless times, making a parody for maybe all the scenes, and writing about it as my favorite movie ever in the acceptance exam of the high cinema institute. Simply this movie made me ask myself how they did it?, pushing me to study how they ""do"" it.<br/><br/>""Round up the usual suspects""<br/><br/>Here the formula magically worked. The drama, the actors and the music; everything and everyone clicked perfectly. The 10 out of 10 is being given to nearly all the elements. This is about to be the utopia of movies.<br/><br/>I think that the cinema was so ahead of its time in this movie. For instance, the camera just moves in unusual ways for the early 1940s. I didn't feel any 40s, meaning the worst of the time or even its usual stuff.<br/><br/>What a story with complicated: global situation, love story, and moral choice. You have to love the way all the characters pilgrimage to their noble truths at the very end. The way Rick Blaine, the anti-hero, becomes a hero. The way Captain Renault saves him as well. And the way they, Rick and Renault, find friendship in the last time, place and people.<br/><br/>Btw, that *twisted* end was made during the shooting, to harmonize with the new political circumstance (Pearl Harbor). That could have turned it into loud naive patriotism, luckily it hadn't!<br/><br/>""What an amusing little fellow""<br/><br/>Rick is the man. Playing chess with himself, refusing the tune that tortures him, being the model slaughtered lover for the 20th century. He looks indifferent towards the tense circumstances. But basically he's an ideal romantic guy, who was shocked when knew that love couldn't be that ideal, personally and generally, in real life; so he acted as a stone, fighting for nothing, suppressing his heart to give him agony all the way. Though, lastly, his unspoken self-moralities end the situation philanthropically even if that meant more personal agony for him, to not represent the beauty of unexpected sacrifice inasmuch as alive yet hidden ideal man inside any of us. Remember too that we don't love Rick because he preferred the welfare over his happiness only, we love him because he tricked all the parties during the road to that as well!<br/><br/>I can't forget the way Bogart throws his love's crying letter off the train, the way he sets smashed at the night of seeing Ilsa after many years, or the way he makes the ""hellabeans"" speech at the end. He was the prince of sadness on Casablanca's throne, the original Mr. exiled in the movies, and the guy who chooses Not to win the girl in the end. Bogart as Blaine, or Blaine as Bogart, is so-ugly-yet-so-noble-he's-more-charming-than-prince-charming. And if you looked up the source of this equation, then you've just found it!<br/><br/>""I came here for the water!""<br/><br/>This is a dialogue to be taught, with so serene comedy; it comes in certain places to lighten smartly the hard atmosphere. I adore many clever lines and strangely I don't get board despite how many times I rehear them: ""I'm shocked, shocked to find that there was gambling in here/ Your winnings sir / Thank you very much!"".<br/><br/>""Play it""<br/><br/>It got one perfect music score. And the song, ohh; with the warm voice of Dooley Wilson it sums up the story of every movie and rather every life: ""Well, it's still the same old story. A fight for love and glory. A case of do or die. The world will always welcome lovers as time goes by"".<br/><br/>""Here's looking at you, kid""<br/><br/>I adore the ""He just a lucky guy"" situation & double-meaning remark. I know that my tears go while the last 10 minutes, not because the lead leaves his love, NO, but because the rebirth of heroism inside of him, and the pretty solidness at portraying that cinematically in such immortal thrilling moments. Plus the last shot, in which Rick and Renault walk among the stars; this is one of the best endings ever.<br/><br/>""A lot of water under the bridge""<br/><br/>My friends used to hate me for talking about it non-stop, though, surprisingly, they loved it when saw it. It got me not seeing movies for nearly 8 months after I first watched it, according to hypnotizing feel it caused and one real stunned question it gave: ""Is there any movie better than this?!!"". I hated only Paul Henreid's dryness, the fact that Bogart was shorter than Bergman so they had to hide that all the time, and the way anyone looks at this as ordinary movie. If only every movie tried to have something from it.<br/><br/>""Does it got a wild finish?""<br/><br/>Though I've loved a lot, but I think I've never loved a movie like I loved Casablanca. It makes the dream so true."

","I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, not unlike the 95% of the population that has seen it and claimed it arguably one of the best films ever made (along with ""Citizen Kane"", of course, and maybe some others). So what can I say about this great success of a film that has not already been said? Yes, this movie is one of the best love stories ever filmed, along with some of the best actors doing their best acting, beautiful lighting, camera techniques and loaded with heavy moments and metaphor. <br/><br/>I would have to say that every aspect of this movie reached my expectations. But the most enjoyable part for me was getting to observe all of the famous phrases, which I have heard many times throughout my life but not known their origin, in their correct context. On numerous occasions I have seen my grandfather raise his glass, after saying grace before dinner, and say, ""Here's to looking at you kid"" and then chuckle to himself. I never new what he was quoting (I never usually do) so it was so great to discover (after twenty years of hearing it) that it was Humphrey Bogart my papa was in fact quoting. In conclusion, it is so interesting to see Casablanca's permanence and the effect that it has had on so so many people. And it was certainly thrilling for me to finally experience along with them."

","The 1942 American film, ""Casablanca"" directed by Michael Curtiz, is one of romance and drama. This winner of 3 Oscars, including that of Best Picture, is set during World War two. It stars Humphrey Bogart,Rick Blaine, who is faced with a dilemma, in which he must decide between love and virtue. Since I had already seen this movie before, I was able to study it when we watched it in class. I really like how the lighting was used throughout the film. A great example of this, is shadow usage, for instance when Rick goes and gets some money from the vault, and we only see his shadow on the wall. Also i loved the plot. This has become one of my all time favorite films, and I am proud to say that I give this movie 6 out of 6 chicken nuggets."
"james-m-donohue","9","1","2","21 October 2009"," As good as people say it is.
","I usually find it hard to watch Bogart movies. It is not because I don't like him. It is because he's such a good actor that he usually makes everyone else look like a horrible actor in comparison. This is especially the case in Maltese Falcon. Luckily, most of the other main characters were good enough to compete. Ingrid Bergman was a great female lead. Peter Lorre was able to break out of his self-made cliché and become more than a simple sidekick though it still seems impossible with his character voice.<br/><br/>The sound was really good as well. A piano would often be played in the background to help create a feeling that there was a lot going on that wasn't being seen which made the world around them feel more rich and alive.<br/><br/>The special effects were good for the time as well. Considering the time period, scenes which would show the characters watching a plane fly looked pretty realistic. The lighting was the true visual gem. The whole movie felt like modern painting. I always had my eye trained on the screen looking for how my attention would be grabbed. There was one shot where Humphrey Bogart was opening his safe. To bring attention more towards Bogart while also showing and establishing the other character's presence, Bogart only had his shadow shown to imply his presence while making him look more highlighted. Every shot in some way was supposed to trick the viewer into seeing what the director wanted to be seen and only that.<br/><br/>It also had a great yet subtle message about honor and what someone or some people should do just because it is the right thing to do like go to war and that sometimes it is selfish to not enter a war rather than not.<br/><br/>I could probably go on and on for 10 pages, but this is the best I can do while being concise and also while not revealing too many spoilers. This should be seen by almost everyone just so that an opinion can be formed. It is that important of a movie."
"chrisj893","9","1","2","20 October 2009"," A Truly Iconic Film
","Casablanca (1942) is a great film that uncovers the pain and hardship that individuals had to deal with while living in a world that was at war. Humphrey Bogart's character, Rick Blaine, acts as the self-tortured protagonist, someone who ""doesn't stick his neck out for no one"". His character is powerfully dynamic and gripping, one cannot predict his actions. The casting and character writing are quite superb, everyone complements each other and Rick and Ilsa (Ingrid Bergman) create a powerful, passionate foil. The direction and lighting of the film are also very complementary to the great final product. Throughout the film there seems to be two different color and light schemes. The flashbacks offer bright and pretty light to go along with the uplifting flashback storyline. Once back in the bar the lighting is dark and ominous, giving the watcher the idea that something is not right in Casablanca. Casablanca has become an iconic film for numerous reasons, but one reason stands out. This film is about the struggle in a worn torn country and the struggle with ones past. To put it simply this film is real. There are very few false ideas and false feelings. Only films like this can stand the test of time."

","This is the near-pinnacle of classic film.<br/><br/>I first saw Bogart in ""The African Queen"", and was very interested in his other roles.<br/><br/>Most of the movie plays out in a café. ""Rick's American Cafe"" is as classic and memorable of a setting as perhaps the library in The Breakfast Club or the resteraunt in My Dinner With Andre. Me and my fiancée have even gone to the extremes of emulating/replicating Rick's Cafe in the Sims games.<br/><br/>This place is a little piece of glamor and refuge away from the troubled north-African continent. People flock to Casablanca to get hooked up with transport to the USA, most of them escaping WW2 ravaged Europe. It's a cultural epicenter. The Nazis understand the town's significance and use it to exercise their influence on the region. They work together with the local French authority to maintain the flow of people (more notably, money) through this port to the western world.<br/><br/>Things go a little haywire when a wanted Czech resistance leader decides to show up at Rick's café. With this resistance leader, is the woman Rick has been drowning himself in booze over for years. He becomes drawn to her, and struggles with the task of sticking his neck out for her (and her friend, who has the Nazis on his trail).<br/><br/>That's pretty much it.<br/><br/>In-between all of the plot twists and sparkly-stuff, there's a few characters you actually care about. There's a setting as classic and campy as only this period of cinema could provide. Bogart is the man, he's one of the biggest on screen bad-asses I've seen in awhile."

Casablanca is the ultimate classic, and that's a fact. From its memorable and ever-repeated quotes to Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman, all the way through its music (the enduring As Time Goes By), the postcard scenes and the mix between a drama about the always attractive Nazi subject and occasional ironic jokes. How could we ever forget the scene in the airport, ""Play it, Sam"", ""Here's looking at you, kid"", ""We'll always have Paris"", ""Round up all the usual suspects"" and ""This is the beginning of a beautiful friendship""? We never will, not only because of what they represent, but because we'll keep on hearing them and watching them in every movie, TV show, book and every single artistic expression. Casablanca marked a before and after in art history and opened a whole new theme in it. In fact, every Hollywood movie we watch has some element of Casablanca, and it will always be like that. Every movie heroine is, in some way, Ilsa, and every movie hero has something of Rick in him, as well as every movie love story has something of theirs. But all this doesn't mean at all that this is a cliché, and that's because this one started it all. Casablanca will endure in time and will always be in our hearts and memories. That's why it's a classic. It is where it all started. I'm sixteen years old, I absolutely LOVE this movie, I cry every time I watch it. This movie is for all audiences."

","CASABLANCA of course needs no introduction, being hailed by many as one of the finest movies ever made, albeit accidentally. I have to say it's been many years since I watched it and I'd forgotten just how good it is. The dialogue is slick, witty and economical and has rightly, with allegedly a little rephrasing from Bogart, spawned some of the most quoted lines in movie history. I lost count of the number of frivolously double-edged and charmingly barbed lines delivered by Rains' Capt. Renault, to whom everyone is a target at the beginning of the movie, almost as if he were unsure of exactly whose side he was on, which is most likely the case as the script was constantly being re-doctored and changed during filming. Even Bergman, who was already preoccupied with the prospect of her next film, FOR WHOM THE BELL TOLLS, had to ask which guy she was meant to be in love with. With the typical ambiguity evident in the rest of the production, she was told to 'play it down the middle'. In fact none of the actors had any more idea of how the whole thing was going to end than the audience did on first viewing.<br/><br/>Everything that makes CASABLANCA a great film seems to have been by happy accident. Originally cast in the three lead roles were Ronald Reagan, Ann Sheridan and Dennis Morgan. Doesn't bear thinking about does it? Thankfully they were unavailable. The now classic 'As Time Goes By' was an established hit that was specified in the original play, but score composer Max Steiner (KING KONG, GONE WITH THE WIND) tried hard to have it replaced by one of his own compositions. Bergman however had by this time had her hair cropped for FOR WHOM THE BELL TOLLS, which made it impossible to reshoot the necessary scenes (at least that's what they told Steiner). As it is, as the NFT said in 1974, 'the sum of all its many marvelous parts far exceeds the whole'."

The screenplay is just as amazing with flawless and quotable dialogue and amazing twists and characters. The performances are the best part of the movie. Humphrey Bogart gives one of his best performances and is amazing but it is Ingrid Bergman who is the standout. She gives one of the best performances in movie history. The direction was also flawless and deserved the Oscar for sure. The visual effects are very good but not as flawless as the rest of the movie.

In the depths of this small town reigns the most popular night spot in Casablanca known as ""Rick's Café Americain."" And let me tell you, this is the place to be. Everybody comes to Rick's.<br/><br/>Our famous hot spot is run by Rick Blaine (Humphrey Bogart), exiled American and freedom fighter. Normal will cease to exist after Rick comes about two letters of transit. All of a sudden, Czech Underground leader Victor Laszlo (Paul Henreid) arrives in Casablancawith Rick's old love Ilsa (Ingrid Bergman). Past memories arise causing love, friction, and much more.<br/><br/>Noted director Michael Curtiz, 56, took over the direction of this filmand did a magnificent job if you ask me! Also having directed films such as The Adventures of Robin Hood (1938), Daughters Courageous (1939), and The Sea Hawk (1940), Casablanca still acts as my favorite of his collection.<br/><br/>Many exciting technological features have been shown in this movie. There are shadow effects that bring out many points of the motion picture. A neat fading transition sought out my attention.<br/><br/>The acting in this film was excellent. Humphrey Bogart, also starring in The Maltese Falcon (1941) and High Sierra (1941), portrayed his character extremely well. Co-starring Ingrid Bergman, who clinched stardom in Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (1941) and Adam Had Four Sons (1941). Together, these two made the show on the big screen. I was compelled by the chemistry between the two.<br/><br/>All in all, this movie was right in the right areas. It was a tremendous love story with drama mixed into it all. It is a great date movie and I would give it 5 stars! ""Here's lookin' at you, Casablanca!"" *****"

","I think I've seen this film about eight times. And every time there's something new: a gesture, a detail, a remark. Of course the statements of Rick are... 'awful' but... so special. ""This morning dear? That's so long ago I don't remember"". And how romantic is Ingrid Bergman's remark in Paris: ""Are those the bombs or is it my heart beating?"". I believe the feelings of a woman in love are so wonderfully said in one sentence. Repeating all those statements will be boring here. The high voters will know them all. Amazing fact that this film is made in 1942...and now (end 2005) after watching 50, 75 of 100 films 'Casablanca' still is my favorite's!"

","In regards to the classic film ""Casablanca"", Mr. Doyle erroneously stated that Victor Francen appeared in the film. Tho Mr. Francen was an excellent character actor, he never appeared in ""Casablanca"". All in all, for a film that was shot on a less then large budget, it still remains one of my all time favorites. Ironically, two actors who appeared in the film were ardent anti-Nazis, Helmut Dantine and Conrad Veidt. Mr. Veidt died in the mid 40s and never returned to Germany. Mr. Dantine who would play many roles as a Nazi after ""Casablanca"" , unfortunately lost both his parents in Nazi concentration camps. But as the line goes in ""Casablanca"", ""everybody meets at Rick's"" and all their performances were top notch."

","I thought Casablanca was going to be one of those over-hyped classics that's boring to watch. I couldn't be more wrong. The first thing that grabbed me was Humphrey Bogart. He did an excellent job portraying his character rick. Rick was a smooth, calm, collect kinda guy which set the mood. All of the actors/actresses contributed some very good acting too. The lighting was top notch and the music will stick in your head. The story which took place in the ww2 era, was very exciting to follow and did not let up once in grabbing your attention. The movie was full of dialog that I've heard in other films and TV shows but never knew it until I watched it. I recommend this movie to just about anyone with a heart and half a brain. So heres looking at you Casablanca."
"horatiohornblower","10","1","2","5 May 2005"," The most important aspect of this film, is its historical importance.
","The most interesting aspect of this film (and something to keep in mind as you watch it) is the tone set early on, that this is a period in which, and a film made while the world still was not who would win the war!! It was filmed in 1941-2, while Nazi Germany still had a FIRM grasp over Europe, the Allies were behind in many aspects in the conflict, and it shows in the film! The insecurity of the people watching this film at the time about how things were going to turn out is the most fascinating part of watching Casablanca! Think about it: When this film was being made and even during its release, people were wondering daily if Europe was going to remain in the hold of the facists, and if the Americas (North and South American Continents) were going to be the last part of the world left as ""free"" nations! Whenever one of my friends asks me about this movie when they see it on my movie shelf, that is what I tell them---and it makes them all the more interested in seeing it. Just to be able to get a glimpse of the Insecurity the allied nations & citizens felt about the future, is perhaps the biggest reason for people to watch it. <br/><br/>So much is made about its perfect style, dialogue, acting, etc---which is true and certainly helps---but to me, the most important thing to keep in mind while watching Casablanca, is that at this time, people were really concerned that the Allies might not be able to 'totally' win the war. By totally I mean, being able to not just stop the Germans and Japanese, but be able to push them out of the tremendous areas of the world that they controlled when this film was made! Add to that, that at the time there was such an Isolationist movement in the US, that there were millions who felt the best that could be achieved was a stalemate which would keep the western hemisphere free, with the eastern hemisphere under the influence of Germany and Japan. Thats part of the reason why you hear the actors make comments about ""Isolationism is no longer practical in todays world"" etc.<br/><br/>Just watching Casablanca with that perspective, should make even the people who aren't thrilled with noir movies, at least view THIS film a little differently from a historical perspective---since it is literally a snapshot of the Allied uncertainty at the time. Just my two cents, but thats really the main reason I love watching this film, and why I repeat view it to watch for that feeling within it. If you haven't seen this film yet, you're missing a piece of history!"

","I must say I loved this movie. Humphrey Bogart is outstanding, as is Ingid Bergman, and Claude Rains goes beyond almost anything I could imagine. One scene in particular stands out, in which a number of drunken German officers are singing a German anthem very loudly. People just stand and watch them, not daring to anything about it, but obviously not pleased. Then Victor Laszlo decides that he has had enough of this, and instructs the band to play Les Marseilles (please excuse my probably incorrect spelling), the French anthem. After a nod from Rick, the band starts up, and Victor begins singing it at the top of his voice. All the rest of the café joins in, and it swells to such a noise, that the Germans can no longer be heard, and they promptly sit down, looking angry. This (in my opinion) is one of the best scenes ever shot."

I have seen just about every single Ingrid Bergman film and have never been disappointed. And Bogie? There never has been or ever will be another like him. His performances will always stand out, no matter how many years pass. Another outstanding performance in this film is by Paul Henreid, who plays Victor Lazlo, an underground hero and bane to the Nazis. There is a part in this film that always overwhelms me. At Rick's place, the Nazi soldiers have all gathered and start singing their ""National Anthem"" much to the chagrin of the rest of the customers, who are mostly French. France has already fallen and is occupied by the Germans, so these people are very downhearted at hearing this Anthem being sung. At that point, Lazlo (Henreid) walks over to the band and demands that they play ""La Marseillaise"", and they do, causing everyone to stand and sing, showing their allegiance to France. The German singers are then drowned out by the French. It is overwhelming and is like a look into the future of the war and Hitler's ultimate defeat. If you want to see a war film, without the blood and guts, but with fine, intelligent and outstanding performances, look no further than ""CASABLANCA""."

","Casablanca was a mystery to me until a few weeks ago. Somehow I never felt great interest about it, although I'd heard for a long time that it was a great movie. Now it's difficult to explain how I feel about it. I understand why it is a great movie: the actors, the background, the characters, the storyall of that. Although it was not a ""love at first sight"" the movie left something in me. However  and I must apologize to those that are true fans of the movie  when I started thinking about it I felt it was very difficult to appreciate it to the fullest, simply because of it's age. I know this has more to do with me that with the movie itself, but the format, the direction, the acting, well, the structure of the movie, is very related with it's time (obviously). This is not a critic, just something that I'd noticed for a long time and now had the opportunity to express: most of the movies below a certain date (for me maybe 1970) report to things that a younger generation has some difficulty apprehending ( it was in the mid nineties that I became more aware of the movie world), mostly because what was interesting and new 60 years ago is not necessarily so now. This feeling is more about all the other movies than about Casablanca itself. It's very natural to see it, without thinking it's an old movie; somehow it feels right. Only with Citizen Kane have I felt the same. Of course it's remarkable that so many years after it was made it still holds something special. About the restwell, forgive the relief."

Love is the thing that can make you survive, and win your battles, you could really feel this tense atmosphere in the movie.<br/><br/>The actors who made this film a success had tremendously superb screenplay, leaving us with some memorable and touching lines such as ""Round up the usual suspects"" and ""We'll always have Paris"", it made me feel sad with these words and the emotions on Ilsa and Rick's face.<br/><br/>Another thing you must pay attention to is the movie song ""As time goes by"", I loved the way they used the song whenever they could throughout the whole movie, and when Sam played the song, the expressions on Ingrid Berman and Humphrey Bogart's faces showed the sadness and struggle of their memories together through that song. It was also so relieved to see that Rick's Cafe had so many connections and Rick was quite kind in some situations such as helping the young Bulgarian couple.

","I'd seen ""Casablanca"" many times before taking Robert McKee's ""Story Structure"" workshop several years ago. His artful dissection of the film--the centerpiece of his presentation--served only to increase my admiration for its many levels of significance. Its narrative design, its psychological subtlety, and its effectiveness as propaganda early in World War II make this a film that offers new insights with each new viewing. Like great literature, its richness remains superlative but never superfluous, and its economy of expression articulate, not taciturn. When I occasionally teach scenes from the film in theater and literature classes, students often note how even very minor characters with only a few lines achieve a presence that exceeds their roles. For many of my students, ""Casablanca"" becomes the beginning of a ""beautiful friendship"" with their own capacities for appreciating the kind of artistic integrity it embodies."
"TKnight_1","Null","1","2","11 August 2004"," The Greatest Film Ever Made
","A bold statement, especially considering I haven't seen every movie that's ever existed, but as far as the classics we all know and that latest new epic or new teen comedy is concerned, Casablanca is simply the greatest film of all time.<br/><br/>It is honestly difficult to say this, especially when The Godfather, Gone with the Wind, and Lawrence of Arabia are taken into account. Out of these three I'd say The Godfather is probably the most interchangeable with the greatest of all time, however The Godfather does lack the ""go out to the movies and take your mind away for a hour and a half"" aspect that is so necessary in films. <br/><br/>When you go to something like 2 Fast 2 Furious you are going solely for escapism and entertainment. When you go see Darren Arnofsky's ""Pie"" (if you could have found it in a theater) you are seeing it solely for it's artistic value. Neither aspect of going to the movies is better than the other. There are those high-brow, art house people who watch nothing but Pie, Transpotting, and Fight Club who say 2 Fast 2 Furious or anything like it is utter crap and has no value. Then there are those teeny-bopper idiots who watch nothing but TRL, American Pie, and think black and white movies are boring and they are just as wrong.<br/><br/>The best movies ever made are certainly not those starring Paul Walker or Sean William Scott and feature nothing but explosions and fart jokes. Nor do the best movies ever made have actors you've never heard of and deal with the deep, dark issues of the human mind or make as many jabs at pop culture, or any culture for that matter as they can. Such art house movies negate the purpose of movies, which shall always be at its core, escapism. However, escapism at its extreme negates the power and meaning movies can transmit.<br/><br/>The best movies ever made are those that combine these two aspects. Art and Entertainment. People should never be extreme one way or the other with almost everything in life and movies are certainly one such thing. <br/><br/>Casablanca does everything I've mentioned that makes a perfect film. Those who love Brittany Spears and American Pie probably have never heard of, nor will they ever appreciate this film because their parents have taught them black and white=boring. Those modern critics who look back at movies like Casablanca or filmmakers like Frank Capra and call his work meaningless, sensationalist tripe are just as wrong and closed-minded as the teeny boppers.<br/><br/>Casablanca contains great performances from the greatest actors, wonderful cinematography, intelligent dialogue, and the greatest classical love story ever told on screen and the greatest, realistic ending of any film ever made as well. Just as the romantic comedy would not exist without Shakespeare, the modern romantic drama and film noire, would not exist without Casablanca. <br/><br/>See it and many other films of the past. <br/><br/>The greats of today would not exist without the greats of yesterday."

","I watched a series of Humphrey Bogart movies within a span of two days: To Have and Not Have, Casablanca, The Maltese Falcon, and, Dark Passage. While the first two movies have lots of similarities, I rate Casablanca to be better. (Of course, I'm totally fascinated by the face of Lauren Bacall; but yet the role of Ingrid Bergman was more firmly planted.). My main reason for liking Casablanca over To Have... is that, in Casablanca, Bogart is a defeated man, a man running away from himself, a man who would put his ""neck out for nobody"" (mainly because he's too scared to be hurt again; or in other words, his past experiences have left him synical.)...but yet he has full control over his faculties...to such an extent that when circumstances put everything at his feet, he can see through it and can decide that the victory that is waiting there to garland him won't be his triumph, but rather another, a greater defeat. And then he decides the most logical, rationale course of action that transforms him into the winner we all would like to be, and allows him to come to terms with himself.<br/><br/>This movie deserves a place in the wish-list of every movie lover; and once it's watched, I'm sure, it would naturally be in the list of one's all-time favorite movies."
"naim81","10","1","2","22 July 2004"," Casablanca isn't Casablanca without Humphrey and Ingrid!
","Casablanca, starring the cool Humphrey Bogart and the angelic Ingrid Bergman is more than just a movie. It is a landmark film, transcends deep into American culture, and become the most popular motion picture of all the worlds of all the times. What makes Casablanca so popular? I can't explain it, so does everybody I supposed. I sincerely don't think that the pairing of Bogart and Bergman made them the best of all time. Bogart is better with his real life partner, and Bergman is far better with Cary Grant, her match in terms of good-looks and sexual tension. Nevertheless, Rick is Bogart's best role, the role really suited him. Bogart typically played smart, playful, courageous, tough, occasionally reckless characters who lived in a corrupt world, anchored by a hidden moral code. Rick seemed as cool as cucumber, but didn't dare to hear somebody played 'As Time Goes By'. Other than Casablanca, his best films are The Maltese Falcon and The Treasure of Sierra Madre. If you want to appreciate good acting, Bogart's Rick is the first to start. Ilsa is hardly Bergman's best role. She's more convincing as a tortured wife in Gaslight or an alcoholic woman in Hitchcock's Notorious. But when the most beautiful woman in the history of films played the role of Ilsa, Ilsa too had become the most beautiful female character in the history of cinema. I can't remember seeing a face more beautiful than hers; she is breathtaking, illuminating every scene. To watch Casablanca is to fall in love with Ingrid Bergman. Both Bogart and Bergman wanted to quit during filming, because they thought the story was ridiculous and unbelievable. Bergman was more critical, she hoped that nobody will ever screened Casablanca again after she died. The whole production was a chaos; nobody thought that they were making the best film of the 20th century. Bogart having problems with his third marriage, Bergman worried about her future role in her next film, the producers didn't know the ending yet and so on. For those who might think of remaking Casablanca, just forget it. For the greats Bogart and Bergman have long been dead, and for Casablanca isn't Casablanca without the two of them."

","Casablanca is one of the most highly-regarded films of all time, by critics and viewers alike. There is something in it for everybody: action, suspense, humor, and romance. Though that may sound like a line ripped from a movie poster, Casablanca deftly balances its time between these varied roles to emerge as one of the most well-rounded films in all of cinema.<br/><br/>The story is simple: Rick runs a café in Morocco, a haven for those oppressed by the Nazi regime in 1940's Europe. ""Rick's Café Americain"", as it is called, is a refuge for both Americans and those simply down on their luck. One day, Rick's old flame, Ilsa, arrive in Casablanca, her husband in tow. She is not exactly welcomed. As Rick puts it, ""of all the gin joints in all the world you had to walk into this one"".<br/><br/>Above all, Casablanca is vivid. Though that may seem like an inaccuracy, given that the film is in black and white, there are other ways for vividness to manifest itself than through color.<br/><br/>Monochrome though it may be, the contrast between blacks and whites, between sunlight and shadow in Casablanca is intense. Rick seems trapped in darkness as he stews after hours in his café. Ilsa seems nearly angelic in many scenes, her white face and clothes shining in soft focus.<br/><br/>The film seems itself to sweat. Outdoor shots appear muggy, humid, and uncomfortably warm; many shots seem intentionally blurred, ever so slightly, to give the impression of heat in the air distorting the picture, or perhaps salty sweat obscuring the vision of the camera.<br/><br/>The performances in Casablanca are top-notch. Talented character actors such as Peter Lorre, Sydney Greenstreet (both of ""Maltese Falcon"" fame) and Claude Rains create convincing and memorable characters, while leading stars such as Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman shine as the main characters, Rick and Ilsa.<br/><br/>Casablanca endures as a pop culture icon, many of its lines achieving catchphrase status. The never-uttered ""play it again Sam"", Rick's oft-repeated ""here's looking at you, kid"", and the movie-ending ""this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship"" are all well-known, and frequently referenced in other works. It endures because though the story may take place in a specific time, the idea of the film is timeless: to sacrifice what you want most for what you know is best. It is the ultimate human ideal, and just as that ideal is held high, so is Casablanca."

","Casablanca, does it reflect society or does society reflect this little hole in the wall resort? When watching the movie, one can't help but notice all the lines that just seem so cliché and yet fit so well into the story; is it because the coolest cat of them all (Humphrey Bogart) is delivering them? Is it because this movie is completely satirical in nature so it just adds humor to the plot? Or is it because the clichés we hear everyday have come from this movie all 10 + of them. <br/><br/>Maybe not so much reason number 2 but definitely reason 3 and perhaps a little of number 1. Humphrey Bogart is THE definition of 'cool'; literally, look it up in the dictionary and his picture will be there. So when this swanky, hip guy says 'Here's lookin' at you kid' for the umpteenth time, it's acceptable because it's Bogey, and what Bogey does is cool, never overdone. <br/><br/>This movie is set during WWII and is about a leader from the underground movement (Victor Laszlo played by Paul Henreid), his wife (Ilsa Lund Laszlo played by Ingrid Bergman) and the owner of a little café, (Rick Blaine played by Humphrey Bogart). It is about when they have a chance meeting in Morocco, some for a first introduction and others for a surprise reunion. Of course, there is a lovely flashback set to the lovers' song and the story of what happened years ago and how things have ended up the way they are becomes clear. As a 15 year-old freshmen this movie wasn't enjoyable, but 3 years later this movie is absolutely adorable and very much recommended as a 'must-see'. Berlin and Bogart has such chemistry and the story has such an interesting twist, it's hard to accept but at the same time that's how things must be. It leaves you with a sense of completion but at the same time uneasy because there are other possibilities that will never be fulfilled. 3 weeks later, the lost dreams are still irritating to this reviewer. <br/><br/>American society is defiantly portrayed in this film, Humphrey plays a café owner that, 9 times out of 10, is doing something for his own benefit, but then he does something to help someone else and it just seems to completely mask the 'bad' things he may have done. For example, there is gambling going on in Rick's Café; there is a roulette wheel, in fact, a fixed one. This wheel is fixed so that Rick is getting more returns back and it isn't a fair game of chance. But then a woman in a desperate situation with a genuine need for money to save herself, her husband, and their marriage comes along and Rick gets soft. He then discreetly tells the woman's husband the winning slot number and color so that he can win money and they can get on to a better place. Rick saved that woman from a huge burden and it completely makes up for his owning a fixed wheel. <br/><br/>This is much in the same way reflective of American society. As a country we are constantly doing what we need to get ahead in life, even if for some people it requires cheating or lying; much the same way we have tremendous powers over other countries we didn't get it just by sweet-talking. But other people will come along once in a while and hit a soft spot in your heart and there is an urge to do the right thing and help them out, much like a country will be in need and we'll help them out, hopefully in the best way possible. <br/><br/>This movie is really a great one; it has love, danger, and politics, an interesting mixture of topics to keep every person interested in some way. Rated highly among movies it definitely has earned a top spot on this reviewers list. And if anything, it reminds us to help other around us make the best possible decisions for their lives, we need to follow Rick's example a little more often even if he does do a lot of dirty business he truly does care for those around him if they are good people."

I haven't seen many movies this old, so who am I to judge, but there is no doubt this movie has aged like a very fine wine, even today, black and white as it is, this is still a movie that will always stand as a remarkable romantic movie, maybe even the mother of all romantic movies. I can at least say that even now, so many years after, and my young age taken in consideration, this movie still has an effect on me, and it never gets boring at all, it keeps the perfect pace for all 110 minutes, which is quite outstanding.<br/><br/>Now for those who think Casablanca is just a romantic movie, it's not, actually it has many others aspects to it. And i think that is why this movie works so well, we see other problems being taken up, perfectly they are adjusted so there are not too many of them and the romantic issue is still the main theme, but the sub problems works well. Especially i noticed how the movie always got our interest opened for something that feels kept as a secret, for example the past of both Rick and Ilsa, before they met in Paris. That single thing was never revealed until very late in the story, which for me meant that i was constantly curious to find out more throughout the movie.<br/><br/>The movie is quite good directed, the director have found an nearly perfect pace for the movie all along, it never gets boring and manages to be entertaining and interesting all the way through, something that i think is quite amazing, the time flew by so fast I was amazed when it ended. And that is indeed a good thing, i hate it when movies have to bring up boring sequences, and it's something that for me drags down a lot in my overall opinion, but Casablanca really impressed me on that.<br/><br/>The acting is also quite good for this movie, acting in the earlier days are usually very different than modern days. That goes for this movie too. Best was Mr. Bogart, i actually thought he did a very good job playing a cynic man, who deep within had a heart of gold, all it took for it to open was the one woman. Ingrid Bergman played a fine role too, although i disliked her false tears, they didn't look very convincing to me.<br/><br/>To sum it all up a bit. There is no doubt this one of the greatest romantic movies of the history, and it is the work of a perfectionist, every single detail seem to be thought through, and the movie works fantastically well and has very few flaws. The movie has aged perfectly, I think one of the main reasons to this is that there are barely any use of special effects in the movie, something that is very easy to spot now a days, but this movie can be watched without problems, even now a days. If i had to point a negative side out, which I have to do naturally, the movie didn't make me cry and really feel with my heart as I was hoping for, the movie is good no doubt, but i never really fell in love with the characters. Something that i think is necesarry for a romantic movie to succed to a top grade, but there is no doubt anyway, if i get the chance, then I will watch this movie again.<br/><br/>8/10"
"Rosebudsthesled","Null","1","2","10 May 2004"," The greatest movie ever made
","When one closely analyzes a movie, they find that it is even better.  Such is the case with ""Casablanca,"" in my opinion the greatest movie of all time. While studying this movie, I've noticed many interesting things which shows how brilliant this movie really is.  For example, when Renault meets Major Strasser at the airport, he says, ""unoccupied France welcomes you to Casablanca.""  Now think about that.  UNOCCUPIED France.  He clearly has no respect for Nazis.  That's just one of the little things that makes this movie great. <br/><br/>But how can I write a review of ""Casablanca"" without commenting on everything else?  Humphrey Bogart--the greatest tough guy in movies.  Ingrid Bergman--a hottie with a brain (take that, Denise Richards!).  Paul Henried--manages to get the scene stolen from him at every turn, but when you watch the movie, it's hard to think of it without him, Claude Rains--fantastic!!!  Peter Lorre--Possibly the most memorable small character in movies.  Even the dialogue should stand out as a performance. Julius and Phil Epstein were so good at writing lines that the actors could say and show that the movie was getting into their heads.  Who doesn't know the line ""Here's lookin at you, kid?""  Few films have ever been better. Wait a minute, no movie has ever been better.  It is the greatest movie in the American cinema."

","With a classic that mirrors a time period as well as Casablanca does, it really sets a standard as to what a romance drama should be, as well as a pretty tough movie for others to follow.  The dramatic story line of two lovers torn between uncontrollable circumstances is a touching one indeed, but instead of focusing on the obvious attention grabber, the love story, director Michael Curtiz added other elements to this movie such as current events to make for a movie that the audience could relate to better, and get a better perspective for what was happening in the world around them. 	<br/><br/>Set in a little town in Morocco during WW11, Casablanca was a town for refugees to flee to  while in search of  exit visas in order to gain a new life.  Even with the fictional story, the history is true, which is something that audiences could watch and learn more about during a time when so much  chaos was about.  Not only that, but audiences today can watch Casablanca and get an idea of what people went through only a few decades ago.<br/><br/>
Along with the history, the characters in this movie add a whole other element which makes it unforgettable.  Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman are one dynamic duo.  The chemistry between them is so intense, that one could only guess that the two were actually together.  Also, Bogart's tough guy persona keeps the audience guessing, one never knows exactly how he'll react to the situations he faces throughout the movie because the whole time he is battling a decision to do what he wants, or to do what's right.<br/><br/>
All in all, this was an incredible movie.  From the history to the characters, everything was great.  There were no bad parts, all the elements tied together so nicely that classic is the only word to describe it, which is what the movie is, a classic."

","Casablanca, the `All-American' film.  Here is the story of two accidental lovers, a classic story line of any movie.  Thinking of a love story you think simple sappy love, yet Casablanca is no where near simple, nor sappy. <br/><br/>	Being made in 1942, this film isn't your everyday movie with sex, alcohol and more sex.  It actually contains a thing called (GASP!) dialogue to reveal how a character is feeling or to explain a situation. And yes, this does get quite long at times, causing any viewer to become quite confused and on the verge of sleeping.  Taking this into consideration, a younger viewer would not appreciate this movie as much as an older viewer would. <br/><br/>	Getting used to the ambiance of the movie is the hardest part.  After that, you may find yourself at the edge of your seat wanting to know more and more of what happened to this couple, Rick and Ilsa.  Rick, a `tough, New York American,' isn't the type of guy that would come off as sympathetic or capable of love.  Yet, as the movie progresses, you realize that he was once a lot happier and certain events have hardened his heart.  Ilsa happened to come into his life at the wrong time, causing her to choose between Rick and, we later find out, her husband.  The movie goes on and, once again, in Casablanca, Rick and Ilsa are reunited. 	Other than just a love story, people don't really realize that this was also about the political issues going on in 1942, causing people to be able to relate more to the movie then than anyone would be able to now. <br/><br/>	Being loved for the past 62 years, this movie is an amazing classic.  A great movie for anyone to enjoy and love.  I would give this a 9/10 because it is simply great."
"eyeluvhotboyz","9","1","2","29 April 2004"," Americana at its best
","Casablanca is the epitome of `Americana' films.  You have to lost lovers, the tough guy persona, and Humphrey Bogart.  There is nothing in this movie that this reviewer doesn't like. <br/><br/>One of the most highly used story lines is in this movie, the lost lovers. A perfect romance spoiled for some reason.  This was the story in Casablanca.  Rick, played by Humphrey Bogart, and Isla, played by Ingrid Bergman are these two characters.  They could not have picked a better duo for this movie.  The chemistry between Bogart, and Bergman was fantastic. Because they worked so well together, it made the story very realistic.<br/><br/>This movie also includes the `tough guy.'  Bogart's character, Rick, is the ultimate example of this.  The best way to describe him is using one of his quotes from the movie, he sticks his head out for nobody.  He also never drinks with his customers, which shows his detachment from others.<br/><br/>Last, but not least, this movie's star is Humphrey Bogart.  This man is Americana.  He is looked upon by many Americans as `the epitome of cool.' Although he is not an incredibly attractive man, his presence makes many people love him.<br/><br/>This review gives this movie a 9/10.  It is a movie that many people would enjoy.  Casablanca is not recommended for children, simply because they may not understand the movie."
"Jennydavis131","9","1","2","28 April 2004"," a great classic film
","Love, passion, corruption, lies and murder are only a few things that are contained in Casablanca's story line. Made in 1942 it remains a great film that people still talk about today. Rick Blaine (Humphrey Bogart) is a man bitter about love, and doesn't stick his neck out for no one. He lives in the city of Casablanca in Morocco and owns his own American café which is more like a saloon than a good place to sip coffee. A long love Ilsa (Ingrid Bergman) revisits Rick unexpectedly and leads to a lengthy flash back to better days in France.<br/><br/>As the Germans are trying to take over the world during WWII people flee to Casablanca to try and get to America for a free and safe life. The plot speeds up as a customer of Rick's asks him to hold on to papers that will lead anyone out of Casablanca and into America with no questions asked. When the man gets killed by the corrupt police, Rick is stuck with something he doesn't want and does not know what to do with it.<br/><br/>Casablanca is one of the most emotional movies the viewer will ever see, from love and lust to murder and deception you're always on the edge for your seat and wanting to know more.<br/><br/>The actors could not have done better. Humphrey Bogart's detached emotion adds a lot of comedy to the film, but when he loosens up sentimentally you can't help but to cheer. Ingrid Bergman is a great actress who can love you one second then pretend to hate you the next. Claude Rains who plays Capt. Louis Renault is a man who gets what he wants when he wants it even if it costs other peoples lives, but some his cold heart unthaws.<br/><br/>The dialog in the film is lengthy and somewhat confusing at points, but normal for those classic films that try to be sophisticated.<br/><br/>
Casablanca is a film to watch over and over again without it getting old or boring, and can still connect to its audience 60 years later. So here's looking at you kid."
"ericglunneborg","9","1","2","27 April 2004"," This movie proves how hurtful a love triangle is
","Casablanca is one of the most popular films ever made. The movie takes place in French Morocco just before the start of World War II.  This is a place filled with rich Europeans who wanted to escape the war,  crooked officials, and criminals who are trying to profit from the war.  The movie starts with the murder of a  German courier who had been ambushed in the desert.. He was carrying two transit visas. These were extremely valuable travel documents, that meant free passage to Lisbon, and from there to America and freedom. An American night club owner, Rick Blaine, is stopped  by a passport dealer who has the transit visas. He asks Rick to keep them for him for a few hours. Rick agrees and hides the documents in a piano. <br/><br/>Rick Blaine, an  American who owns and operates the nightclub/casino is the main character. The part is  played by Humphrey Bogart. Rick has not taken sides in the fight for control by the French resistance and the  Nazi officials. Bogart plays the part in his usual calm, collected self until his lost love from the past walks back in to his life. She is not alone, but is with the most wanted man in the resistance. They have come to Rick's place to hide out from the Nazis. When the two see each other, memories of  their time together come flooding back. Ilsa  Lund, played by Ingrid Bergman, needs Rick's help. Rick is the only link to obtaining the necessary exit visas for her and her husband ,Czech freedom fighter Victor Laszlo , played by Paul Heinreid,  to get out of Casablanca safely. The German-controlled local government, headed by Captain Louis Renault (Claude Rains), is moving in, and Laszlo has to move fast to get his visa. It is a classic love triangle: Ilsa  is still in love with Rick but feels compelled to support her husband, while Rick controls the future  of the man who is married to the woman he loves. This is very disturbing for Rick. After all, Ilsa was the one to walk out on him when they were in Paris.  Bogart plays the part of a tough guy who hides his hurt behind a shield of cynicism. Ilsa's arrival in Casablanca rips through in this shield. One scene that sums it all shows Rick,  drinking alone in his bar, wondering why of all the places in town, she had to walk into his. Other supporting cast members are: Conrad Veidt as the Nazi commander on Laszlo's trail, Peter Lorre the black marketer who sells the letters  of transit,  and Sydney Greenstreet who is the head of the citys black market.<br/><br/>When you watch this movie, you can almost see the conflict on the actors faces. The truth is that they themselves did not know until the final day of filing who Ilsa would choose, he husband or her former lover. By playing whole movie without knowing how it would end, the scenes became more convincing because the actors themselves were in in the dark about the ending of the movie.<br/><br/>Casablanca is a classic movie that has something for everyone. It is filled with romance, intrigue, mystery, and suspense.  This film deserves five gold stars."
"brower8","10","1","2","22 January 2004"," Masterpiece of understatement
","Without doubt the cast is incomparable, but even so the script is the real star of Casablanca. Everyone has a sob story to tell (except for the Nazis who have given people the material for their own sob stories), but the movie would sink into the most depressing experience possible if the script didn't cut off the sob stories before people started to show self-pity. The only self-pitying character is Rick Blaine (Humphrey Bogart) -- who doesn't realize how lucky he is to be an American. <br/><br/>Such is the genius of this movie, the explanation of its location in both the AFI's ""100 Best Films"" and IMDb voters' choice of it -- both in the Top 10. Today it is impossible to imagine anyone not delving into one's own abyss of hurt feelings under such circumstances. Casablanca in 1941 is Purgatory; occupied Europe is Hell, even if it is a man-made Inferno, and the Nazis intend to make their Hell more fearsome than any that Dante thought up.<br/><br/>Casablanca succeeds because it forces us to feel empathy for the victims of nazism -- people who have been sent into concentration camps, rich people who have become paupers because the Nazis confiscated their fortunes, people displaced. We are left to our own devices to imagine what Rick Blaine and Ilse Lund (Bergman) did in Paris. <br/><br/>We find comic elements, but the comic scenes underscore the desperation that people feel, as in the pickpocket vignette; as the pickpocket fleeces a patron of Rick's bar, the pickpocket gives a smarmy lecture ""there are vipers, vipers..."", and the Dutch banker feels his pockets. Happiness is entirely to be found in nostalgia for better days, or hope for the future for a restoration of things as they were before the war. Who can forget the scene in which the Germans sing ""Die Wacht am Rhein"" (actually, an innocuous patriotic song from the 19th century), only to hear almost everyone else break into a rousing ""Marseillaise"", with the resolution of the situation with the police prefect ordering the bar closed for ""gambling"", the police prefect collecting his winnings. <br/><br/>Casablanca relates one moment in time -- arguably the most desperate moment in time for refugees from the Hell of nazi Germany and its empire, when Britain stood alone or when Russia seemed on the brink of collapse, before the United States was in the war and sealed the fate of nazi Germany, and before the fullest horrors of nazism became known.<br/><br/>This is an absolute must see. A basic rule for any collection: it is far better to have one great movie than five ""fair"" ones, and forget the bad ones altogether."
"nscmovieguyj","10","1","2","2 January 2004"," BEST MOVIE OF ALL TIME!!!!!
","There is no doubt in my mind that Casablanca is the best movie ever made. Its absence of flaws and abundance of excelences makes this movie irrisitably good. The chemistry between Bogart and Bergman only adds to this films excellence.  Also, the comedic relief in a somewhat dark plot from Claude Rains and Peter Lorre never fails to amaze me.  Many people say that Citizen Kane is a better movie, but that film, although excellent, does not have the quality that Casablanca does.  What I mean by that is most people know numerous lines and scenes from Casablanca(some who haven't even seen the movie) and I frequently hear it quoted n everyday conversation.  I cannot say the same for Citizen Kane. The combination of these elements makes the perfect formula for the greatest movie ever made, CASABLANCA!!!!"
"ssparling","10","1","2","1 January 2004"," A timeless classic and one of the great films of all time.
","Shot as just another film in the days when Hollywood was pumping out movies like an assembly line.  Indeed, the film is not shot as an epic with sweeping scenes of battles or with elaborate sets or special effects.  So why all the fuss?<br/><br/>This film has grown in stature because of the brilliant acting of the two lead characters, the remarkably witty and clever dialogue, and the war-torn romance that is the heart of the picture.  In other words, it is an actor-driven film with a terrific script and a story about love, war, and politics, i.e., a formula for a masterpiece.<br/><br/>Put simply, Ingrid Bergman is electric in this film.  She is stunningly beautiful and turns in a remarkable performance as the brave and sensual Ilsa.  Her facial expressions alone convey more than most actresses can do with monologues.  She convincingly plays a young women torn between her ideals and affection for her husband-mentor and her passion for Rick, the one true love of her life.<br/><br/>Not to be outdone, Bogart's performance is probably the strongest of his career.  He simultaneously manages to play a self-absorbed sulking saloon keeper, passionate lover, and sentimental patriot.  Rick is a complex and deep character, deeply wounded by Ilsa's choice to leave him at a train station in Paris to tend to her once forsaken husband.<br/><br/>On top of this passionate romance, the film is paced by its political subplot, which is all the more interesting since it was filmed during World War II.  The script deftly weaves jabs at the Nazis and packs political themes throughout.  Moreover, the superb script conveys complex character interactions and messages without hitting the viewer over the head with explanation or narration.  Nowhere is this more apparent than in the underlying negotiating between Captain Renault and Rick on a variety of topics throughout the film.<br/><br/>Bolstering the performances of Bogart and Bergman is the heady acting of Henreid and Rains.  Indeed, Rains' performance as Captain Renault is one of the great buddy-womanizer roles of all-time.  He is simultaneously charming and without conviction.  Henreid delivers a terrific performances as the political icon Victor Laszlo.  He is both dashing and courageous without ever trying to overshadow Bogart.<br/><br/>This is a great film that gets better each time you see it."
"Mr_Mirage","10","1","2","1 January 2004"," About as flawless as film as any made...
","I am normally loathe to agree with anything written by Roger Ebert, but in this particular case I am 100% in agreement with him: this film gets better each time you sit through it.<br/><br/>Flawless performances by a superb cast, from a cobbled together script that should not work, and yet it does. With each viewing, this film resonates deeper and deeper. Each character starts to show the signs of the strains that they are under, inflicted from without and within."

Cultures mixed together arabs, russian, csezhs, a black pianist. We heard the Reichs hymne en the Marseillaise as time went by.So many live were is such danger, countless people searched for a better life, noone could expect what lay ahead. But Rick and Ilsa had a memory, a secret, a lost love on which both of them tried to hold on, and then again she had to let go. He wouldn't let go, but let her go. A description of love that no longer can hold. We know better now. At the end even the bad guy turned out to going to be the partner in Brazzaville. Looking back, felt strange. It made me happy that I grew up in the seventies."
"agmoldham","10","1","2","22 December 2003"," A cliche is appropriate - This is a timeless masterpiece
","Anybody that likes movies must know this story. What really makes this film stand out from so many others is the chemistry between Bogart and Bergman. The ending is classic since Ilsa and Rick are separated even though Ilsa wants to be with Rick rather than war hero Victor. Nowadays, the films ending would probably change and even if it didn't a sequel a couple of years later would see them together. The great thing about Casablanca is that we never know what became of these three."

"gordonriot","10","1","2","6 June 2003"," As time goes by...
","...this remains one of the very best films ever made. Whether or not it is *the* best is open to debate, but it's easily top ten.<br/><br/>Humphrey Bogart gives the performance of a lifetime - understated yet full of passion and rage simmering under the surface. At first we only see the hard-headed side of him but it isn't long before the artifice starts to crumble and we see the romantic idealist coming through. We realise that the cool, emotionless exterior is really a mechanism for self-protection - protection from the hurt of his own past, but also protecting him from the Nazis, who would probably kill him if they knew where his true sympathies lie.<br/><br/>In the end, he becomes a true hero - sacrificing his own desires for the woman he loves and risking his life to help the Resistance cause. And all the way through, Bogart's acting shows remarkable restraint - it would have been all too easy to play it like Jimmy Dean in Rebel Without A Cause or Marlon Brando in On The Waterfront, but while he is just as much of a free spirit as those young hotheads, Rick Blaine is a man of immense wisdom and experience.<br/><br/>On top of all this, we have one of the most memorable scripts Hollywood has ever produced - there's a classic line in every scene. The film also has plenty of humour, and some great characters played by some great actors. Claude Rains is wonderful - he plays his part with a light touch so you can't hate him despite his apparently treacherous exterior, though it only really becomes apparent in his actions in the closing scene that, like Rick, his collusion is mostly an act of self-preservation.<br/><br/>At under 100 minutes, the film manages to cram an awful lot in to a very neat package - there is no padding at all, every second is made to count, and that's one of the reasons why you can never tire of watching it over and over again.<br/><br/>In short, there is nothing to fault with this film. It's perfect."

The characters are great, even after many viewings, the acting is perfect, and barely a scene goes by without a classic line or moment.  If that isn't enough, just think about what it must have been like in 1942 watching this movie, before anyone knew how the war would really turn out."

"andrew7","10","1","2","25 February 2002"," what can I say?
","I have practically nothing to say about this film.  Apparently, some people seem not to like it.  This is utterly baffling to me.  The vast majority of people seem to love it, which is my idea of justice.  This film deserves to be adored. <br/><br/>There are two different kinds of Great Films, in my mind.  One is the film that quite obviously sets out to be great, and succeeds.  Something like ""Lawrence of Arabia"", ""Citizen Kane"", ""Schindler's List"", just about everything Kubrick ever did.  That sort of thing.  Films that are oozing with ambition, and manage to carry it off.  ""Casablanca"" isn't like that. ""Casablanca"" is a small film, a simple film, and it doesn't have that ambition behind it.  This film isn't trying to make a statement, or to do something bold, new, and shocking.  It's great simply by virtue of being very, very good.  <br/><br/>The primary credit for this goes to those responsible for the script, including the actual scriptwriters, and the authors of the play upon which it was based.  The central premise of this film is the bizarre tangle of motivations involving Rick, Ilsa, and Victor.  That idea is both elegantly simple and breathtakingly effective.  [There again, a common theme in my reviews of late... simplicity and power are natural allies.]  The performances by Bogart, Bergman, and Henreid are fully up to the task, bringing out every nuance of the situation.  <br/><br/>This film also sports one of the all time great supporting casts, including big names like Claude Rains, Sydney Greenstreet, and Peter Lorre.  But there isn't a single performance in the entire film which rings false.  This also has a lot to do with pulling this film up from a good one to a great one. <br/><br/>
For those who don't like this film, well, I don't know what to say.  The attitude is incomprehensible to me.  But that's all right.  As long as you've seen it, that's enough.  I think there are a few things that are so good, so useful, and beneficial, that everyone should do them at some point. Take piano lessons.  Study elementary economics.  Watch ""Casablanca"".  And if you don't like it, fine, you don't like it.  But you just have to see it."

"marcheroffaith","7","2","7","24 May 2005"," Casablanca- A classic movie that must be seen
","Casablanca is included on the list of the top ten movies that everyone should see in their lifetime. This is a classic movie that is loved by many. The plot and genre is very appealing to many people and I believe that Casablanca is definitely worth seeing.<br/><br/>The plot of Casablanca is a classic love story and focuses on a women torn between two men. This plot has been demonstrated in many other movies and books, but it is presented especially well in this film. Even for people who do not enjoy a good love story, this movie is still appealing. It takes place in Africa during World War II and can appeal to audiences who enjoy films in this setting. The plot depicts the trouble that people went through to come to America and be free during this time. Overall, Casablanca is attractive to all audiences and is accepted as a classic movie.<br/><br/>To enhance the excellent plot of the film, director Michael Curtiz used many filming techniques to make the movie more appealing. The cast was carefully chosen and the actors and actresses did a very good job in depicting the characters that they played. While the film is older and there are not many special effects, Casablanca is still appealing to younger audiences today due to the plot, cast, and other techniques.<br/><br/>Many other filming techniques used in Casablanca that help to enhance the movie include the use of sets, scenes, shots, and lighting. All of these characteristics must be present to make a good film and all are apparent in Casablanca. The lighting in the movie is especially well done to enhance the mood of each scene. Without even listening to the dialogue, a movie viewer is able to decide the mood being conveyed through the lighting of the set.<br/><br/>Flashbacks are also an important part of this film. Instead of starting the plot in France when Ilsa and Rick first met, the writers began it when the lovers met a second time in Casablanca. Effective flashbacks were used to show the past and make the movie more interesting. Through the use of fading from one time to another, the film has more excitement and keeps a readers attention.<br/><br/>Overall, Casablanca is an excellent film that should definitely be seen. The movie uses many good techniques to appeal to viewers and is a classic love story and war video."

","'Casablanca' exceeded all my expectations, when I watched it this morning! I mean before I didn't think I would like it at all, but I know it's revolutionised cinema, and I can now see exactly why. I watched this film in my Film Studies Lecture at Kingston University with about 200 other people. I haven't seen many films that are that old, but I now appreciate that these films were for another generation, and used all the technology available at the time to it's fullest, and if it wouldn't of been for these films, we wouldn't see the sort of films we love today. I thought Humphrey Bogart was extremely good in this film - he came across as a very cool character, and by the end I wanted to emulate his unforgettable lines such as: 'Here's Looking At You Kid', and of course the very final line in the film. This film also teaches many valuable lessons, that all of us can learn from. Finally, I recommend this film to everyone because of the epic values it portrays.

I just wish that Orson Welles would get more credit than Bogart ever did. At least Welles directed his masterpieces. I'm sure that this post will anger some people, but I'm intitled to my opinion. But if you like Casablanca, and you've never seen ""Citizen Kane"" or ""Touch of Evil"" you have no idea what you've been missing"

","I am flabbergasted that this totally boring load of rubbish could become such a major classic! Humphrey Bogart is obviously a great actor, but this movie almost put me to sleep!

This film has absolutely no right to be considered a classic, nor should it ever be considered anyone's all time favorite movie!"

","Few movies had a greater impact on popular and cinematic culture than the immortal love story of Casablanca"". Hence, the expectations from it were huge and, alas, only semi fulfilled. The story is just plain straightforward, revolving around the American expatriate (Bogarth) squirming his ways around Morrocco during the Second world war. When the old love steps in (Bergmann), the cliché won't stop until the very end that is just too expected and pathetic. However, Humphrey will set the standards for the male cool behavior and some of the most memorable lines in the history of cinema will be delivered during the course of this spy and love story. Casablanca"" is a good movie, but not an excellent one as the majority of ratings and reviews claim to."
"Blueghost","4","2","8","17 September 2016"," A film with some plot holes, but okay entertainment.
","I'm sure I'll get voted down for this review, but oh well.<br/><br/>Here's the reason; as pointed out in the commentary by the late great film critic Roger Ebert, what does anyone need with ""letters of transit"" to get out of Vichy / Nazi occupied Morocco? Just hijack a vehicle of some kind and get the hell out of there. How come nobody thought of that?<br/><br/>As I sat through the entire movie many many years ago I kept wondering why Boggie didn't whip out his gun and just force some cabbie to take him and Garbo out of the nation ... south along the African Coast to some sleepy village and wait out the war, or at least long enough to book passage to the states for the both of them. But then again I attended SF State and not USC nor UCLA, so what the heck do I know?<br/><br/>But the whole films like that. It's a reflection on a romance gone sour by the fact one of the parties, all those years, had a romantic obligation to someone else. So the whole film boils down to how much bitterness is in the lead character, and does he let that win out over ""the greater good"" to fight fascism. That's pretty much the film in a nut shell.<br/><br/>Does it work? Well, again the plot holes arise. If this film had been true to form, then the lead character might have been thrown in the slammer or just shot on the spot without the formality of an arrest. And the woman and her husband detained without question and given to the nazi soldiers. I mean, this is war. Right? <br/><br/>But, for some strange reason there's this whole thing about dealing with formalities of getting papers and rekindling old flames for the sake of ""the greater good"". I think a better script would have been a bit more gritty, forgone the whole parading of male egos to impress the female audience, and just let it be the shoot-em-up film that it was probably in its first draft, because otherwise this makes all parties, even the allies, look like complete idiots.<br/><br/>I mean, come on, there's an enemy of the state who's trying to escape. You know his name, what he looks like, where he's staying, who his girlfriend is and everything else. You've got some troops there and the Vichy government operates at your blessing. Are you really going to just let that dude and his lady wait it out until he can get some passport saying he can leave? No. You wouldn't.<br/><br/>Would you throw your weight around town pretending not to notice them? Probably not. But again the film is engineered for a female sensibility. The female audience largely bought into the notion of needing a stamp of approval from an enemy power to leave. It's complete and total nonsense, but there you have it.<br/><br/>I don't get how and why this film was made, nor why it's called a classic, because if you think about it for a couple of seconds, then the whole thing should fall apart on its own premise.<br/><br/>Still, I suppose I should add that if you can suspend your disbelief (or even belief) for this thing, and you can buy into the whole plot to begin with, and then really wonder if Bogart's character is going to give a rat's backside about the plight of a couple of wanted people.<br/><br/>And, finally, I'm going to get dinged for this too, but the nazi military is not the only set of bad guys we've vanquished throughout our history. They're one of the most notorious, if not the most notorious we've ever come across, but if you look at other films about international conflict, you'll note a high degree of staging put into this film. And I think that should set the intelligent viewer to wondering about this film's merits in the first place.<br/><br/>Watch at your own risk."

","I'm like Stepp, who posted similar comments on Sept 16th. We watched it for the first time last night and I failed to see what all the fuss is about. Was it a good movie? Yeah. Was it a classic? Not that I could see. First, I felt like I was watching the 1942 verison of the Gilmore Girls because the dialog by the actors was at a lightning pace. I couldn't understand half of what was said at the beginning. Unfortunately, a storm knocked out our signal for about 15 min so that added to the confusion.<br/><br/>The acting was OK. Again, they talked to fast at first, which is crucial when you're trying to figure out the plot. After that it went along fine. I even enjoyed the relationship between Bogart and the Chief of Police.<br/><br/>Bottom line, hundreds of movies have come along since then that could hold Casablanca's candle."

","I specifically watched this movie because I had heard so many good things about it, most of them coming from imdb. I went into this movie expecting something good because of how many people (including my parents) said it was great and since it was up so high on the top 250 I had much confidence for it to be great.  I am only speaking honestly though when I say that it wasn't that good. I mean I guess I could say I enjoyed it and all. But I just don't see what everybody is so crazy about.  It had some good moments and all but what else was so good? I didn't even think Bogart was that good. This is the first Bogart movie I've seen though so maybe he has better performances. I just recently became interested in movies and I am trying to watch many of the really old greats.  I recently watched The Third Man, Ben-Hur, Gone With the Wind, and Lawrence of Arabia.  Comparing all of these to Casablanca, they are all better.  And Casablanca and Gone With the Wind are constantly feuded over and I have to say even though I didn't like the four hours of Gone With the Wind, it was still a better movie.  I mean I think saying number 6 is so wrong.  There is no way it could be number 6. But please I would like someone to e-mail and give me some of their thoughts and maybe we can talk just movies.<br/><br/>Overall Rating for Casablanca: 7/10"

","Casablanca (1942) <br/><br/>**** (out of 4) <br/><br/>Michael Curtiz's all-time classic about a war-torn city, a local bar owner (Humphrey Bogart) and his former love (Ingrid Bergman). There's really nothing new I can add to this film because it's certainly one of the greatest classics to come out of Hollywood but on a personal level, I enjoy The Treasure of the Sierra Madre more in the Bogart canon. I know a lot of people feel Bogart was just an image and not really an actor but I've never bought into this theory. Sure, he once again plays a tough guy here but the flashback sequence shows another side of him as does the smaller moments between he and Claude Rains. Bergman is very good in her role but I feel she's the weakest character in the film. It's not that she's bad but I feel the supporting players are a lot better here. You've got Rains, Peter Lorre, Paul Henreid, Conrad Veidt, Sydney Greenstreet and of course Dooley Wilson. While this film wouldn't make my #1 movie I might put it down as having the greatest dialogue of any film made."

","As much as I loved the story, and as much as I respect the great actors in the movie, the actings seemed a bit forced and unrealistic in some scenes; maybe not as good as the movie itself. That said, they still did a great job.<br/><br/>What I loved the most about the movie is how characters' personality in the movie are introduced, but not changed as story goes. As if they were rigidly written first, and then the scenes and the storyline were adapted to fit those personalities. Seems easy to understand why this might be the best thing about the movie, not the amazingly depicted cafe, not the fantastic markets, and not even the beautifully played and sang musics.<br/><br/>The Paris flash-back in my view was either too short to be of any signifacnt importance, better said, too short for demonstrating any glorious memories, or too long for such an obviously implied back-story and, of course, chemistry and romantic tensions observed in prior and further scenes.<br/><br/>The battle of sentimentalism is a never fought one here. This is how well-written the characters are.<br/><br/>Thank you for making such a great movie Mr. Curtiz."

","There are some undertones of male dominance to the romance that don't necessarily work, especially considering that there's only one proper character involved, but the rest of the picture is a layered, vibrant and sometimes quite dark portrayal of a unique setting that's heightened when you remember that the flick itself was made long before it was clear that the Nazis it portrays weren't going to win the war. 'Casablanca (1942)' is a cynical but well-drawn piece with a gruff lead who's callously charismatic and charming in that straight-talking kind of way. It manages to make you care for quite a small story while highlighting that, no matter how insignificant it may actually be in the grand scheme of things, it means the world to the characters caught in the middle of it. 7/10"
"richard-1787","10","1","3","11 September 2016"," The Great American Movie - historical context
","I don't know how many times I've seen this movie. A lot, because every time it's on TV and I start to watch it, I can't stop. It is, indeed, the great American movie.<br/><br/>Other reviewers have offered reasons why it's so great. There's no point in my going over all that.<br/><br/>What I thought I would add here is the historical context.<br/><br/>Rick makes it clear, in his scene with Sam, that the movie takes place in December, 1941. At that point the U.S. had not yet entered the war, though of course it would on the seventh of that month when Japan bombed Pearl Harbor.<br/><br/>By the time the movie was released in November, 1942, however, the U.S. had not only entered the war but invaded North Africa, successfully. Whereas the prefect, Louis Renault (Claude Rains), still acknowledges the Germans in December, 1941, as a good employee of Pétain's far-right dictatorship, by the time the movie opened, at the end of 1942, the French in North Africa were quickly siding with the Allies. Curtiz foreshadows this brilliantly at the end in one of the many famous scenes when Renault, rather than turning Rick in for killing the German Major Strasser, diverts the police and throws a bottle of Vichy water (Vichy was the capital of the Pétainist government) in the trash.<br/><br/>American audiences therefore had the advantage of seeing this story with the hindsight of current events, a knowledge that the Renaults of Northern Africa would, indeed, ignore the Germans and side with the Americans.<br/><br/>But they also knew that the outcome of the war was still undecided. D-Day, the June, 1944 invasion, was still far in the future. In November, 1942, the Germans would not have looked at all funny to them, but very real and very dangerous."
"Emmajoy93","10","1","3","3 May 2016"," Casablanca amazing piece of American film
","Casablanca was an amazing piece of film, and has become such a great classic. It was some very famous scenes, and lines, that I have actually heard from people or television shows or movies mimicking Casablanca before I even saw the movie. Such as "" Here's looking at you kid."" And the famous line at the end that Bogart tells Ingrid to get her on the plane. The song ""As Times Goes By,"" became very well known I think because of Casablanca. Casablanca had such a cultural significance because it was filmed during World War II, there were many people who went to Bogart's restaurant for his help to get them out of Casablanca so that they could live, because the Nazi's were starting to invade it. Casablanca was a classic romance in which Ingrid tried to chose between to loves of her life but knows she can not stay in Casablanca or she will do, so Bogart tells her to leave in that famous scene at the end and risks getting killed himself for shooting one of the Nazis. This film is very enjoyable, and I highly recommend it to anyone who has not seen it."

","I had never seen this film until very recently, however, I can surely say that this is one of my favorite films of all time. Although it is certainly a classic romance, the fact that such a serious even was occurring around it made it a lot darker than romantic movies commonly are. I thoroughly enjoyed the use of black and white in this film, as well. Arthur Edeson did a wonderful job making sure that the way this film was shot, really captured everything that was going on around them. Flashing back when Rick and Ilsa were together and madly in love, the tones were so much lighter than the present time heartbroken and troubled pair. When Rick is sitting alone in his café listening to Sam play ""their song,"" there isn't a single light directly on him. The brightest lights in that scene came from the cars passing by outside the bar. This film was so incredibly beautiful, and so beautifully shot, I can certainly understand the common hype about it. Here's to looking at you, kid."
"Challenger2013","10","1","3","20 April 2015"," One of the Best Films of All Time
","I'm going to tell you all what you already probably know: ""Casablanca"" is one of the greatest films of all time. However, there is something that most probably have never even considered. If you look at all the elements that make up this film, it could be considered the best of a number of genres. It could be considered the best noir film, the best thriller, and even the best war film ever. And I'll tell you right now that it sure as hell is the best romance ever put on screen. ""Casablanca"" has it all and it never gets old. <br/><br/>The plot is timeless. Humphrey Bogart plays Rick Blaine, a self-proclaimed ""drunkard"" and American living in Africa during World War II after being forced out of Paris by Nazi oppression. He's a mysterious fugitive, and he runs a bar and gambling joint as a loner. One day, a woman named Ilsa (Ingrid Bergman) walks in with the famous Victor Laszlo (Paul Henreid). The scene that follows between Rick, Ilsa, and Rick's piano player Sam (Dooley Wilson), is perfect. Rick is shocked to see her and emotion flows from the scene from all three characters. These emotions include surprise, fear, and anger. As we learn the backstory, a romance between Rick and Ilsa in Paris, we become closer to each character. Not just Rick and Ilsa, but Victor too. We are caught in a love triangle for the ages. Both men love Ilsa and Ilsa loves both men. Should she stay in Casablanca with Rick or should she go to America with Victor? Should Rick give Victor the transfer papers he is hiding from the Germans or keep them for himself? These are the questions that appear and it is thrilling to see them answered. <br/><br/>The biggest strength of the film is the plot, driven by an excellent screenplay. There's a reason this film contains five or six of the most famous quotes in film history. We never get tired of hearing Bogart say ""Heres looking at you, kid."" Speaking of Bogart, he and Bergman give tremendous performances as the star-crossed lovers and they are supported by some wonderful supporting performances, especially that of Claude Rains as Captain Renault. The film is shot beautifully. Other than Citizen Kane, it is probably the best display of black-and-white in the history of American cinema. Nothing is particularly spectacular or special about it, but it is done so flawlessly. <br/><br/>""Casablanca"" is deservedly heralded as an ultimate classic because it does so much near- perfectly. Ultimately, its influence is still felt everywhere today. We've all heard the lines from the film. We all think of the film when we hear of the location. The problem is that so many people today reference these influences without ever seeing the film or even knowing that they come from the film. It really is a shame, considering how well the film has aged and could still affect audiences of this generation. ""Casablanca"" was and still is a film ahead of its time and will continue to amaze us all as we watch it over and over again."
"Cinemarker","10","1","3","11 March 2015"," Truly a Timeless Classic
","Casablanca is a movie that most people hear about. A lot of Cartoons give a nod to it in some way, it has been parodied multiple times, and it has influenced numerous other films. Casablanca is a movie I had thought was always over-hyped and placed on a pedestal for no reason other than it being a ""classic"". After watching the film however I understand the hype. It is a timeless movie filled with romance, drama, and the occasional witty line. Bogart and Bergman have an electric chemistry and just look well together overall. Although they do not end up together in the end, Ilsa (Bergman) and Rick (Bogart) share a romance on screen that truly shows that ""if you love something set it free."" Rick risks it all to help the woman he once loved, and still probably does love. Aside from the romantic relationships, the friendship that binds Rick and Captain Louis Renault (Rains) appears genuine. They are two men who become entwined with due to unfortunate circumstances and what becomes of them after the film is something that I personally would like to know about."

","Casablanca starring Ingrid Bergman, Humphrey Bogart, and Paul Henried was an all-around great movie. This is a romantic film where Ilsa was falling for Rick and Victor. Rick was Rick and Ilsa had the stronger relationship. Victor and Ilsa seemed to have a plain relationship. In the end, Rick forces the captain to allow Victor and Ilsa to go to America while he stays behind. This shows how much he loves Ilsa because he wants the best for her even though it meant her going with Victor. A scene that was good in the movie was the national anthems being played in the café. The German's started singing their national anthem. Then Rick cued everyone else to do the French national anthem. This is a key scene because it shows the people actually standing up against the Germans and their invasions. The relationship with Rick and the Captain was also good too. Most viewers at the end would actually think that Rick turned on him but he didn't. He used the captain to help Victor and Ilsa to get away and then the captain stood up for Rick when the Germans came to try and stop them. It shows how strong their relationship was."
"Patti-Gaston","10","1","3","5 March 2015"," Timeless classic
","Truly one of the most remarkable films ever made; from the witty dialogue to the stunning photography to the beautiful acting, I cannot praise this movie too much. Almost immediately you enter into a visual spectacle from the beautiful reflections on the walls of the Cafe Americain to beautiful women dressed in sparkly costumes to Rick in his perfectly pressed, white dinner jacket we enter a world of sophistication and beauty. We quickly learn however that there are real troubles just beneath the surface. Immediately we learn that 2 German couriers have been murdered. The police suspect the murderer is at Rick's café but before the police arrest the suspect he asks Rick to hold the transport papers he stole from the Germans which are the keys to freedom from the German controlled, but unoccupied French Moroccan city of Casablanca. Rick is suave, sophisticated and clever until Ilsa walks in,the woman who broke his heart. We learn that the two had a love affair in Paris and as they were about to leave Paris together right before the German occupation Ilsa did not meet Rick at the train station when she was supposed to. She sent a note along with Sam that said she was not coming. Needless to say Rick was bitter when she shows up in his Cafe but over time he does find out why Ilsa left him. He is also inspired on how to use the transport papers. While the overall focus of the movie is the love story between Rick and Ilsa and the sacrifices made for love, the Nazi threat is made all to real. The release of the movie 6 months after the United States' involvement in WWII, shined a light on how terrifying it must have been for people trying to escape. I think everyone should watch this movie again and again to remind us all that even in the absolutely worst of times love can conquer anything."
"ppilf","9","1","3","4 March 2015"," A Classic - great acting, directing, dialog & music - but has bad story flaws
","Like all movie fans, I love the movie Casablanca. It's in the top 15 of my list of favorite movies. It is truly a classic. Its great actors, director, music, dialog, and romance arouse deep emotion. According to the film's makers, Casablanca was one of those amazing unexpected successes that fate occasionally surprises us with. Apparently no one involved in making this movie expected it to be the famous classic it became. Reportedly, some of the actors and film makers nearly turned it down because the script just seemed like another unremarkable war movie. What I find amazing is that it is set in late 1941, less than a year before it was written, filmed, edited and released; long before World War 2 even ended. Some reports claim it was a propaganda film; not sure that's true.<br/><br/>Casablanca contains two scenes that are among favorites of mine. The scene in which Ilsa and Laszlo first meet Sam and Rick in Rick's nightclub. And the scene in which Laszlo tells the nightclub orchestra to play the French national anthem to counter a group of Nazi officers loudly singing a patriotic German song; all the patrons then join in singing the French anthem, totally drowning out the Nazis. The emotion aroused by these and many other scenes in this film attest to the talent of the director, actors, film editors, music composers, and production staff.<br/><br/>But, although Casablanca is a very moving experience that captivates its audience, its story plot and subplots have very bad faults, at some points downright absurd. These are known among critics, authors, and even war historians. I'm a terrible stickler for detail by nature and I can't help but absorb all aspects of a movie. I consider these story flaws unfortunate because the screenplay is otherwise beautifully written; it won an Academy award. Casablanca also won Academy awards for best picture and best director, all very much deserved. The main criticism with the story is the fictitious ""letters of transit"" which are supposed to be some sort of super passport, and would certainly have to possess supernatural powers to wield the effect and great value depicted in this story. The letters (plural for some reason) play a key role in the plot. There are many flaws in this concept and in the entire story; it really becomes ridiculous at points. So, being the admitted (nearly anal?) stickler for detail that I am, I've actually listed some of those flaws below for anyone interested:<br/><br/>1) First, of course, there's no such thing as letters of transit, never has been. It would seem that a simple forged passport or visa would be a better travel authorization in 1941 unoccupied Morocco.<br/><br/>2) If there were such documents, they could easily be revoked and made useless, just as any document can, and just as governments routinely do with passports that are reported lost or stolen. The purported rareness of these letters, which is supposed to make them so ridiculously valuable, would actually make them much more a risk and a red flag in travel rather than an aid (unless they cause inspectors and soldiers to go into magical trances).<br/><br/>3) Suppose the far-fetched premise is true that these letters are worth over 200,000 francs in 1941 (about $100,000 in today's U.S. dollar). One could easily have them forged for far less. Passports and exit visas are being forged throughout this movie. If government passports can be forged, with their special paper, cryptic engravings and invisible watermarks, then letters and signatures can easily be forged.<br/><br/>4) Again, assume the letters really are that valuable. You'll realize, as I think everyone watching this movie realizes, Ugarte's dumb assumption that by handing the letters temporarily over to Rick somehow safeguards these valuable papers, is absurd. Ugarte could protect them a thousand times better by simply burying them or hiding them in a bush or under an old shed. And savvy Rick would certainly know this. But of course it's important to the story plot for Rick to possess these magic letters. As for Rick's piano hiding place, a 10 year old kid could find a more secure place.<br/><br/>5) Lastly (but not least), Rick's plan proposed to Renault is nonsense. He tells Renault to release Laszlo from petty charges so Rick can lure him into buying the transit letters. Renault is then supposed to arrest Laszlo and turn him over to the Nazis who can then supposedly imprison Laszlo for many years for the serious crime of possessing the letters. In the meantime Rick and Ilsa will be on the plane to Lisbon, using the omnipotent transit letters for travel. What's wrong with this picture? The absurdity is that Laszlo won't be in possession of the letters, Rick and Ilsa will. How will this incriminate Laszlo? Or are the Nazis going to give the letters back to Rick after Laszlo is in prison so that Ilsa and Rick can flee? Totally absurd. Even Renault would be smart enough to see that.<br/><br/>But, again with all of that said, Casablanca's other qualities are so great that they outweigh the drawbacks. It is still a brilliantly directed and beautifully produced classic. It's just a bit of a shame that more time wasn't spent developing a more realistic plot. That would have made it a near perfect film."

"JosephPezzuto","8","1","3","14 January 2015"," Reel Look: 'Casablacna'
","""Here's looking at you, kid."" The year 1940 signaled a final turning point for isolationism. German military successes in Europe prompted nationwide American rethinking about its posture toward the war. Even if America did manage to repel invasions, its way of life might wither if it were forced to become a garrison state. Isolationism now became involvement, as thousands of brave soldiers battled their way through many historical battles and a fight for ultimate freedom. Franklin Roosevelt convinced a largely isolationist Congress to pass the Land-Lease Act, allowing the U.S. to sell or lend war materials to ""any country whose defense the President deems vital to the defense of the United States."" A true war was occurring, and the American people would never dream of succumbing to the Nazi way. However, it seemed that people across the world were all in a whirlwind of discomfort and desperation to survive. These changes, also portrayed by Rick Blaine (Humphrey Bogart), truly captivates what terror has been wrought upon the souls of Europe, and how anxious people captivated by dread and by just living one more day was a miracle in and of itself. But how did this whole outbreak of escaping and massacre soften Rick to a point where he finally did stick his neck out to a desperate couple in breaking free from the world in which he knew that ultimately became a matter of life and death? Let's take a look.<br/><br/>From the play 'Everybody Comes to Rick's' by Murray Burnett and Joan Alison, the film opens to early December 1941, where we meet American expatriate Rick, the proprietor of an upscale nightclub and gambling den in the titular African district entitled ""Rick's Café Américain"". From here we eventually learn that Rick is the sole ticket out of this place back to the States, of whom Rick looks over concerning problems of his own. He is suave, cool and likable, but sticks his neck out for no one. But that all changes when a long-lost love Ilsa Lund (the beautiful Ingrid Bergman) appears in his section of Morocco after a hiatus of many years (Play it, Sam.). Later, Rick sits in his darkened café at the counter of his bar, a drink in front of him to numb the pain of the memories of his past love life that and dwindled away to the present war that soured and choked out the world he once knew to cherish around him only to be replaced with death and despair. A puff of smoke dances and swirls around him as he pounds his fist down on the countertop in frustration to when he recalled simpler times to the tinny tunes of his house pianist Dooley Wilson's (Sam) somber melody (the clinking of champagne glasses compared to the sounds of gunfire). ""Of all the gin joints in all the towns in all the world..."". Rick can simply not get his mind off of Ilsa, of whom he had seen earlier after years of absence, this time with a new lover by her side named Victor Laszlo (Paul Henreid). But Ilsa, still having feelings for Rick, needs him only to transport her and her husband back to America via passports. Rick, as mentioned before, sticks his neck out for no one, and is internally bitter at Ilsa for marrying Laszlo do to his unspoken feelings he has still kept for her all these war-torn years but has yet failed to confess. When Isla points a gun point-blank at Rick much later in the film out of utter desperation after asking him over and over for the letters of departure, Rick still keeps his cool. He knows that he would soon die anyway there and tells her that she would be doing him a personal favor. Near the end of the film a gun is pointed again, this time by Rick at a German captain as he tells him to get away from the phone. Upon refusing, Rick shoots him and the captain falls to the ground in cold blood. As Claude Reins' Captain Louis Renault, after witnessing such an act orders to his troops when they arrive on the scene to ""Round up the usual suspects!"" with Rick standing right beside them, is priceless. With flashbacks of Rick and Ilsa to easier times and days when they could enjoy each other's love and company to their present departure as Ilsa is about to head back to America on a plane with Laszlo, a story like this can still have some romance amidst a murky world surrounded by war, can't it? It's at least something Rick has left to hold on to when its all he has to stay sane in a flavorless period in history. <br/><br/>Ranked as one of the greatest films of all time, winning Oscars for Best Script, Producer and Director by the great Michael Curtiz, 'Casablanca' is a spectacular film in and of itself and a truly remarkable albeit bittersweet love story with a mix of humor of a beautiful bond that can never be between two estranged souls but remains alive and unbroken for both to share and to hold forever in their hearts. This film, for me, will always remain a true classic and for all movie lovers alike, and, with each viewing, will only become more wonderful as time goes by."

","Casablanca is a difficult movie to review because there is nothing particularly wrong with it, but also nothing particularly excellent. It is more about whether or not you like its style.<br/><br/>Its style is very misty-eyed. The insisting violin vibrato in the high register tries to cut into your heart, as the main hero talks harshly to the damsel, but inside we all know that in actuality he really loves her. This film can be impersonated by a lady who sighs as she holds her wrist against her forehead in a gesture of fainting.<br/><br/>Is it cheesy though? Well, no, it does not go that far. It stays tasteful and professional, but its style is very clearly defined and may not appeal to all.<br/><br/>The undertones of the story are about a refugee crisis and anti-Nazi resistance, but the movie is really about the relationship and conversations between the main characters, and to its credit those interactions are good.<br/><br/>Humfrey Boghart is not my favorite actor. He is the poster child of the over-stylised acting that was so persistent in the first part of the 20th century, but this is probably one of his best roles. The most interesting is probably Claude Rains who plays an opportunistic French officer.<br/><br/>It is competently made but there is nothing that strikes as particularly special about this film. There are worse ways to spend an evening than watching a good quality film, but all the hype that goes as far as perceiving this film as the best ever made is really unnecessary."

That makes this brand new VHS copy 22 years old.

","My dad loves this movie. He truly loves it. He has tried to get me to watch it with him many times, although, I'll admit, I have been resistant. He even says that it is his favorite movie of all time, despite having it come out more than a decade before he was born. I did like it. As always, I tried to pay attention to as many details as possible, and also, as always, I found it easy to find my favorite characters (Both of them more minor, in this case). I was not particularly fond of the topic, mainly because I at first did not see much conflict in the movie, but I understood it further as I went on. I did admire some of the shadow work throughout the film and Humphrey Bogart gave a great performance. I personally greatly enjoyed Sam, the Piano Player, and I thought that the romance that occurred between Rick and Ilsa was a nice touch. In conclusion, I say that it is definitely a movie worth watching, and that it is a classic movie for good reason, I also greatly enjoyed the ending."

","Having often heard this title thrown around for years it does live up to its hype. This takes place in the south of France during WWII. The main character is an American who has chosen to start up a club in the city of Casablanca. Humphrey Bogart plays Rich, the American as he is split between choosing the love of his life or saving her and her husband who is a resistance fighter against the Nazi's. The movie was a little controversial because it was released to the general public after the attack on Pearl Harbor and after we entered the war against the axis powers; but before we knew that we were going to win the war.This is reflected in the movie and shows our hopefulness as by the end of the film Rich chooses to step up and fight against the Nazi's as he once did before opening his club.<br/><br/>I believe this was a reflection of the WWII era as his actions reflect the action the USA took during the years prior to Pearl Harbor. What I mean by this is during the early years we would sell guns and supply the allied powers with aid but when the war came to our doorstep we stepped up and did what was right. I think movie goers at the time really enjoyed this movie for that reason. Overall I would have to say this was a very good film for the earlier 1940's era of film making. The use of light in the film was done brilliantly as an almost precursor to the Film Noir genera which would come later in that decade. By this I mean the use of light to set the mood of the scene as either a dark gloomy feel with very little light and the use of shadows to open shots with much light to show a lighter more comical side of Rich."

","I have spent years upon years being told that this is one of the greatest movies of all time in detail. And while, now that I have seen it, I can absolutely see where those feelings are coming from, they didn't translate for me personally BECAUSE of the detail in which people discussed this film. I knew the big ending and pretty much the entire plot going in. It made it a little harder for me to get emotionally connected to what was happening. <br/><br/>The best surprise for me was just how much I loved the relationship between Rick and Louie. I can see now why this is an iconic friendship. Tied to this, I loved the message that every ending has its own beginning as Rick and Louis walk off into the mist together. It's a nice change of pace in a day where the end of every film ends with the couple riding off into the sunset. Here, we have the opposite, but it didn't leave me feeling remotely sad or cheated. I was satisfied with knowing Rick had made the right decision and that he had Louis at his side."
"Natybug97","8","1","3","8 April 2014"," Certain Expectations
","After hearing so much about Casablanca and about how great of a film it was for it's day, I have finally been able to watch it. For a long time it has been on my Movies To Watch list but I've just never had the opportunity or just never got around to it until now, and honestly though it was a good movie, I guess I was expecting more. When you hear about how great a movie is, you have high expectations and you expect those to be met, sadly, this film didn't meet those expectations. The film is a well shot film and the lighting is remarkable how it singles out characters or makes their face look just so, but the story is not necessarily what I expected. I fully expected a sappy romantic movie that you couldn't help but like because the characters were so genuinely in love. Definitely not a man who owns a saloon and is secretly pinning away for a girl that left him at a train station who then pops back into his life very much unannounced and undesired, especially because she is with another man. The story itself is not all bad, don't get me wrong, just not what I was expecting. Though the hero did not end like I would have wanted him to because of his selflessness, he does have a happy ending to a certain degree, and he certainly isn't all that alone in the end. Despite my expectations for the film, it is a rather good film and I would probably watch it again."

","Just watched Casablanca and really enjoyed it! I like the atmosphere of Casablanca itself, a place where no one intends to spend much time but many people get stuck. I like how we meet the characters first and then find out the events that have shaped their uncomfortable looks. Rick is a great character.<br/><br/>Casablanca has tons of classic lines - here's looking at you, of all the gin joints, maybe not today maybe not tomorrow, etc. Also, Ingrid Bergman is gorgeous :) A very chivalrous ending too.

","The diegetic and non-diegetic music in the film created so many different atmospheres. Humphrey Bogart ""Rick"" always has a cast of shadow on one side of his face, but ""Ilsa"" Ingrid Bergman face is always so well lit and beautiful. I know it's a big famous line, but really It creeped me out that Bogart's character kept saying ""Here's looking at you kid"" to Ilsa. She looked like a women to me. Doesn't seem right for an older man to be romantic with a kid? It was impressive how so much was going on between so many different characters and it all blended together smoothly. Wonderful film that i would like to watch again, to understand more of the politics involved."

At first I could not understand why some odd romance film was so important but after watching it now I see. Part of it is writing, the excellent dialogue that ranges from somber and disheartening to clever hilariousness. Another piece of it is the beauty of a story that always keeps you guessing right up to to end with twists. Last is the top notch acting, this is the film that made Bogart's career and it is easy to see why. Realizing now the significance of WHEN this film was released in relation to its content makes me understand how valid the social commentary was."
"tkubas1","9","1","3","19 January 2013"," A Classic Tale
","I've recently got in the habit of watching very old movies. I was scanning through the IMDb top 250 as I often do when I spotted a movie from 1942, Casablanca. I didn't know anything about it except the description. The reason I stopped was because of the extremely high score it had. How could a movie this old be as good as my many favorites? Weeks later I spotted it at the thrift store for fifty cents. I thought I might as well give it a shot for that. I'm glad that I did. Yet another old movie that sheds its age simply because of the compelling story telling.<br/><br/>The story takes place in a city named Casablanca. The Germans are trying to arrest two men; Ugarte and Victor Laszlo. They suspect Ugarte has two letters of transit which allow the holder to move freely through German controlled countries so they can get to America. He plans on selling them to Victor Laszlo. Ugarte and Laszlo plan on meeting at Rick's Café Américain a night club of sorts. When they arrive to make the exchange is when the story really takes off. The owner of Rick's Café, Rick Blane, is a very interesting character. You can't quite tell what he's going to do next. He's played by Humphrey Bogart, who does an amazing job playing the cool customer from New York. You don't know whose side he's on, as he says ""I stick my neck out for no one"" The other characters all have great performances as well. Laszlo, Isls Lund and the French captain all add a lot of character to the movie. One person that I loved was the piano player at the club. He didn't have many lines, but with what he did say I found him to have excellent character. You could tell that he's a great friend of Rick's. The French Captain Louis Renault was great. You'll hate him, love him, and back again. He had a great acting dynamic with Rick; they played off each other so well you would think they actually knew each other for a long time. Conrad Veidt, the German leader was more of a political threat than a physical one. He was always bothering the heroes of the story, always trying his best to make their lives miserable. One of the best scenes was when Veidt was leading a sort of pub song with his men at the nightclub and Laszlo leads a chorus of his own overpowering the German's voice. I thought that scene was particularly funny.<br/><br/>The storyline is what really shines in this one. Movies made this long ago couldn't rely on special effects. The dialog and script really are delivered perfectly. If you like a story where you can try to figure out how everything all fits together than you'll like this. One aspect of the story involves a love triangle. As you might know I'm not too big on love stories, but this one actually makes sense. A lot of movies have a love story shoe horned in just because; in this one the story truly is interesting. I was honestly wondering what was going to happen with this love triangle believe it or not. My only gripe with it was in the execution. Sometimes it had a small cheese factor. The eye rolls weren't as prevalent as most films for sure. I also want to mention the ending of the film. It tied everything together perfectly. We got closure on all the major plot points. The major characters get their subplots closed. In the end, I felt like everything ended the way I wanted it to end and I felt satisfied.<br/><br/>There isn't much to say about the technical aspects of the film. Basically since it's so old all I was hoping for was that graphics wouldn't subtract from the movie. For the most part it's not too distracting. A few of the gunshots looked really unrealistic. Hey, in the end it was more about the story anyway.<br/><br/>If you're looking for an old movie that will surprise you with its complex story and great acting you won't be disappointed with this one. You should definitely see it.<br/><br/>tkubas1.wordpress.com"

I heard this film was very funny, I didn't find it to be very funny, however their are a few times I found it slightly humorous. The relationships between the characters was strong. I thought Rick was one of the best characters, he was so complex and always showing another part of himself.

I don't say this is a bad movie because I'm not in position to but I was so bored throughout it. It didn't captured me. And believe me I really wanted to love it. I was like ""oh so much people say great things about it I'm sure I'm going to love it"" but unfortunately I didn't. I'm a girl who LOVES romances believe me. But I don't know, I didn't get it, I didn't feel the magic... Anyway I guess the acting was good for a 1940s movie. But I think I'm the kind of girl who definitely prefers recent movies like The Notebook. This is the only movie I'll never get tired of watching, again and again. I could watch it all day long it wouldn't bother me, on contrary. So if you like the same kind of movies that I do, maybe you won't like it either. I think it's good to watch ""a classic"" though."

There are also a lot of people looking over their shoulders it's like nobody's safe. You tell this one girl has feeling for the main guy even though she's with someone else.

","Casablanca is an excellent classic. I don't know any other movie which could stay in the same set for most of the movie, and yet still be captivating. The opening of the film is creative with the voice over as we travel along the globe from Germany to Casablanca to Lisbon. A great opening sets us up for a great film; one of the greatest of all time? Perhaps, but nonetheless a wonderful masterpiece.<br/><br/>Humphrey Bogart was excellent. This was the first movie I've seen of his, and everyone said this was a challenge because this was his first lead romantic role. Being my first movie, I could not tell that this was his first role in a romantic lead. He was excellent, and nothing but excellence showed. Bergman was excellent and beautiful in her lead actress role and really made Ilsa who she was. She took the role and made it her own.<br/><br/>The storyline was interesting, but contained a lot of dialogue, and most of it took place in Rick's. This was the only downfall, but despite this it was still entertaining."

There is a deep feeling of raw, pure emotion that basically the entire cast convey convincingly. Secondly, the cinematography is captivating. The dark lighting and heavy shadows add a dramatic feel, while the use of close-ups help focus the viewers attention and get a better understanding of the thought and feeling behind the story. My only problem with the film was that at times it seemed a bit hard to follow. If the situation hadn't been explained to me beforehand, I might have been completely lost.

The whole movie is a memorable scene, but since there are so many memorable ones, its hard to name them all. The battle of anthems when the drunken German Nazi officers are singing the German national anthem in Rick's cafe and then Victor gives the cue for the French National anthem and Rick approves and the club soon drowns out the Drunken German officers. This is truly one of the most memorable scenes in the movie and of all time. <br/><br/>Also the performances in the movie are top notch.

Rick had to make the choice between trading out Victor and keeping llsa for himself or doing the right thing and helping out his old flame and her one true love. The film is great in all aspects. The directing is also incredible. Curtiz did a great job. Overall I would recommend this movie for any movie lover.<br/><br/>10/10"

","From its opening scene, it isn't difficult to see there's something special about 'Casablanca'. The feeling that this is how movies are meant to be made. And from beginning to end, this is an epic romance for the ages. A timeless and gripping picture, it still resonates more than 65 years after its release. Anything you could ever ask for in a motion picture, 'Casablanca' has it and plenty more.<br/><br/>The simple and subtle beauty of 'Casablanca' is mystifying. The romance. The intrigue. The cool sleight of hand. Few films have been able to manage such massive and broad appeal. It is a picture of the utmost mastery. Pick it apart, every scene and every line of rich dialogue, or simply allow yourself to be swept away by its mesmerizing story of love and enduring hope. It is without a doubt a cornerstone of Hollywood cinema, a film that forever raised the bar.<br/><br/>Let us say that a moment is never wasted with the fantastic on-screen talents. The performances are pitch perfect, from the film's headlining stars to small supporting appearances. The legendary Humphrey Bogart plays his cards so incredibly well, every line of dialogue delivered with such subtlety but undeniable authority. Ingrid Bergman, Paul Henreid, and Claude Rains all deliver superb and notable performances, and after so much that has been written about them, you just have to sit back and admire the golden memories these individuals make on-screen together.<br/><br/>Whether it be its terrific performances, a beautiful score, flawless direction, or sweeping cinematography, 'Casablanca' never misses a beat and never disappoints. A classic story of love with the perils of war and politics acting as the key antagonists, there are too many unforgettable moments to count on one hand. The classic 'battle of the bands' between the French and Germans will forever live on as a truly hair-raising and defining scene not only for 'Casablanca' but the entire scope of film. And with one of the most recognizable and memorable endings in history, we will always have 'Casablanca'.<br/><br/>'Casablanca' is a masterful work that lives on today stronger than ever. It's a classic, and rightfully resides amongst the best films ever put to screen. Vintage Hollywood, the way it ought to be remembered. It's true that they just don't make films today the way they used to. And as I continue to make my way through the classics of years gone by, I remember to savor every moment of it.<br/><br/>More reviews at rottentomatoes.com/vine/journal_view.php?journalid=219276&view=public"
"ackstasis","10","1","3","11 June 2008"," ""I remember every detail. The Germans wore grey, you wore blue.""
","Ah, 'Casablanca.' What other film can evoke such powerful feelings of nostalgia, can exemplify so completely the golden period of Hollywood film-making? The year was 1942, and the world found itself in the midst of the bloodiest conflict in modern history. Unlike anything our generation could possibly imagine, citizens were faced with an incredible uncertainty about their future. The Nazis marched across Europe, an astonishing, seemingly-unstoppable enemy, and the United States watched with bated breath from across the Atlantic. Most Hollywood productions responded to such ambiguity with fully-fledged, unabashed patriotism, and war-time filmmakers became obsessed with validating audiences' beliefs that the Allied forces would inevitably win out against Germany, and, indeed, many often concluded their pictures with unnecessary epilogues in which we've apparently already won. Such propaganda, while no doubt ensuring commercial success from war-weary cinema-goers, has regularly tarnished and outdated even the most otherwise-impressive contemporary WWII pictures, as the directors' willingness to simulate a happy ending strikes distinctly false from an era in which the overwhelming atmosphere was that of uncertainty and insecurity (see Billy Wilder's 'Five Graves to Cairo (1943)).<br/><br/>This is not to say that 'Casablanca (1942)' is not a work of American patriotism; indeed, it might just be the greatest example. The film owes its enduring legacy to how seamlessly director Michael Curtiz, and his troupe of writers and actors, was able to encapsulate the sentiment of the time in which the picture was made. The story ends with Rick and Renault strolling resolutely into the thick mist, their futures obscured by the fog of uncertainty that hovers before their faces. What will the next few turbulent years have in store for these heroes? Will they be overwhelmed by the enemy, or continue their noble fight for freedom? Following Operation Torch, the 1942 Allied invasion of North Africa, there were plans to film one of those dreaded propagandistic epilogues, showing Rick, Renault and a detachment of Free French soldiers on a ship. Owing to Claude Rains' fortuitous unavailability for filming, the original ending was left intact, and producer David O. Selznick was never more correct than when he concluded ""it would be a terrible mistake to change the ending.""<br/><br/>When 'Casablanca' was first conceived, the filmmakers apparently had little idea they were about to produce one of cinema's best-loved pictures. A prime example of the studio-bound exotica that was popular at the time, and obviously a war-time off-shoot of Howard Hawks' Colombian aviation adventure 'Only Angels Have Wings (1939)'  perhaps also John Cromwell's 'Algiers (1938),' which I unfortunately haven't seen  the film reproduced the stuffy, humid climate and seedy, corrupt personalities of Morocco on the Warner Bros. sets, which ironically communicate more romantic charm than the real location could ever have provided. The film was shot by veteran cinematographer Arthur Edeson, who had previously worked on the wonderfully-atmospheric 'All Quiet on the Western Front (1930),' 'Frankenstein (1931)' and 'The Maltese Falcon (1941).' His perfectly-framed photography suggests a mixture of stuffy melodrama, glamorous adventure and shadowy noir, though, interestingly, he avoids the sordidness of the latter style's successors, despite the wealth of suitably-seedy characters to be found in Casablanca. Framed through Edeson's lens, it seems that even the most squalid and repulsive of personalities can take on a curious facade of nobility.<br/><br/>No less than six people had a hand in the film's justly-celebrated screenplay. The story was based on a then-unproduced play by Murray Burnett and Joan Alison, ""Everybody Comes to Rick's,"" and was adapted for the screen by Julius and Philip Epstein and Howard Koch, with uncredited input by Casey Robinson. The Epstein twins were initially keen to give the film a few comedic elements; this would, no doubt, have made for entertaining viewing, not unlike a Howard Hawks picture, but might have detracted from the story's core themes of love, loyalty, regret, moral responsibility and self-sacrifice. Koch had perhaps a clearer understanding of the director's preferences  another wonderful film from Curtiz, 'Angels with Dirty Faces (1938),' also poses a vital moral dilemma  and chose to focus largely on the politics and melodrama of Burnett and Alison's play. That so many conflicting artistic ideas somehow melded together, not only into a cohesive narrative, but also into history's greatest screenplay, is a miracle to be credited only to the cinema gods, particularly in view of the fact that Curtiz commenced filming with an incomplete script that was updated daily.<br/><br/>Perhaps another possible explanation for the film's unlikely legacy lies with the distinguished cast, borrowed from all over Europe. Humphrey Bogart, Dooley Wilson and Joy Page were the sole American ""imports,"" and assorted supporting talents were plundered from the United Kingdom (Claude Rains, Sydney Greenstreet), Sweden (Ingrid Bergman), Austria (Paul Henreid), Hungary (Peter Lorre) and even Germany (Conrad Veidt). Bogart, who had been typecast throughout the 1930s as a lowlife gangster, had been given the opportunity to show some humanity in Raoul Walsh' film noir 'High Sierra (1941),' but it was 'Casablanca' that proved his first genuinely romantic role, and, with several notable exceptions, the remainder of his acting career would comprise of similarly-noble yet flawed heroes. Bergman, despite having a rather passive role, was never more enchanting than as Ilsa Lund, and, photographed with a softening gauze filter and catch lights, positively sparkles with gentle compassion and a tragic sadness. Perhaps it's just the romantic in me, but 'Casablanca' represents one of Hollywood's most unforgettable accomplishments. Even as the film draws to a majestic close, and two men forge a lifelong friendship in the fog-ridden uncertainty of War, we immediately feel like asking Sam to play it again just for old time's sake."

","This is it. There is no movie I've ever seen I love like this one. My all-time favorite.<br/><br/>In the first place, it is not a huge, earth-shattering epic. It is a tiny little story, about a small handful of people. It doesn't have a life-changing moral. It is merely the most perfectly cut, perfectly polished gem Hollywood has ever produced.<br/><br/>Humphrey Bogart is Rick Blaine, the burnt-out American who has found a place to die after his heart has died in Paris. He runs a saloon, living more from force of habit than anything else, and his granite cynicism makes him irresistible to others, men and women. When the love whose loss drove him to such despair returns, his mask cracks, and his agony is so wondrous to see. We get to watch his struggle, and he gives no hints as to his final decision until he announces it at the very end.<br/><br/>Ingrid Bergman, as Ilsa, is, clichéd as it is, luminous. She so loves Rick, she so loves her husband. The scene where Victor, her husband, leads that stirring demonstration in Rick's, shows her face full of unadulterated adoration for him. What wouldn't I give to have any woman look at me like that! Her agony is beautiful. We all want her, and all wish we could be either of her heroes.<br/><br/>Paul Henreid, Sidney Greenstreet, Peter Lorre, Conrad Veidt, all gave such performances that they have become stereotypes.<br/><br/>But I must pay worshipful tribute to Claude Rains. I think he has the very best lines in the movie. His cheerful cynicism, his unbridled lust, his proud greed, never bowing to the embarrassment of even acknowledging his naked hypocrisy, make him my favorite part of this great movie.<br/><br/>This is the only movie I've ever seen I love more each time I see it. There are no great depths to plumb here, no hidden pieces of trivia for aficianadoes to find. Just a very nearly perfect story that is enjoyable time and again.<br/><br/>""Who's On First"" is the only comedy routine that is just as funny every time you hear it. ""Casablanca"" is the equally-miraculous movie, just as golden every time you see it, and maybe increasing in value with every viewing.<br/><br/>You don't have to know a thing about the time. You don't have to remind yourself, as you do with ""Citizen Kane"", that this is the movie that started all these things. It shines like a star. The perfectly cut, perfectly polished gem of Hollywood."

","Casablanca is an unbelievable movie that contains one of the greatest love story's ever. Casablanca is a passionate movie and its two leads Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman make this happen in a spiritual way. Their chemistry is the greatest seen on screen. The movie is touching and the scene that touches me the most is when Sam plays ""As Time Goes By."" The North African Location is exotic and adds to the feeling of romance. Humphrey Bogart as Rick is great and you can see his longing for Ingrid Bergman. The flashback scenes in Paris are the greatest expressions of romance ever filmed and you can see the love they shared and how it comes full circle in Casablanca. A lot of famous line are from this movie such as ""Sing It Sam"", ""Who are you really? And what were you before? What did you do and what did you think? Huh?"" and the most famous line ""Here's looking at you kid"". Casablanca is a beautiful story of love that will be shared forever."

","I have watched this film so many times that I thought I knew it inside out, back to front, top to bottom, etc. There is barely a line I can not quote when watching it, and I never tire of the relationships between Rick, Lisa, and the rest. I have wallowed in some of the finest performances ever captured on film, from Bogart's world weariness through to Claude Rains pragmatism, via the slimmy character of Peter Lorre and the largeness of Sydney Greenstreet. There is hardly a foot put wrong by any cast member, and the film is as near perfect as any film can possibly be.<br/><br/>I used the term 'thought I knew it' above quite deliberately, because I was recently privilege to see a brand new digital print version of this classic movie. As the camera moved around the interior of Rick's Cafe American for the first time I thought something was wrong, the scene seemed 'foggy', then it clicked, what I was seeing was the smoke from the cigarettes! The print was so crisp and clear that it was like watching the film for the very first time. The exterior shots were incredibly bright, the dialogue clear and wonderfully full of crack and cackle, exactly as you would expect in a busy place as Casablanca! I have no need hear to go into the narrative, if you have seen the film you will know it backwards, and if you haven't, then why have you never watched this masterpiece? If you fear the digital age of cinema, fear not, if the digital version of this film, which I will always maintain is the best American film ever made, and amongst the best world wide, then I have seen the future, and it works!"

I'm sure you already know what this film is all about, so I'm just going to say this; If there is anyone who hasn't seen this film yet should really start moving to the couch and turn the DVD-player on...

Epstein, Phillip G. Epstein, Howard Koch.<br/><br/>""I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship""..""We'll always have Paris""......<br/><br/>Director Michael Curtiz's Casablanca, released in 1942 as World War II raged in Europe, has enjoyed the reputation of the quintessential classic American movie for more than 60 years. It was Curtiz' crowning achievement, despite having made several successful films for Warner Bros. Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman attained Hollywood immortality in their roles as American ex-lovers who cross paths in Casablanca, Morocco, North Africa during Nazi-occupied Europe. Rick Blaine (Bogart) is an American ex-patriate who owns a jazz nightclub/cafe frequented by many, including thieves, prostitutes, singers, and of course Nazis and Resistance good guys. One such Resistance activist is Victor Laszlo (Paul Henried) who just happens to be married to Elsa (Ingrid Bergman), Rick's former lover. Their romance was played out in Paris, presumably before the war, but she opted to marry someone else for financial stability. When Rick and Elsa reunite, their old flame is rekindled. Much has been said of how terrific the chemistry between Bogart and Bergman is in this film, and they represent a kind of film noir pair which means despite burning hot for one another, they cannot be together as one of them has to answer to a greater good. In this case, Rick must give up Elsa and allow her to remain married to Victor. The ending, made famous through the lines ""Here's looking at you, kid"" finds Elsa leaving with her husband to safety in America, as they are fleeing the Nazis who wish to capture them. Character-actor Petter Lorre was popular at this time and despite being a bit of a ""foreign guy"" stereotype, seems to fit into the cynical, darkly humorous world of Casablanca, which remain not just a love story, but a film noir sample. Warner Bros and Michael Curtiz were strictly old Hollywood studio system but while some films were forgettable during this time, Casablanca is a prime example of the system's success. Great script lifted from a play (Everyone Comes To Rick's), irony, cynicism, humor, comedy, romance- all in the dialogue. Some action including chases and gun fire. The cinematography by Arthur Edeson is typical of film noir - mostly night scenes- but the scenes of Casablanca marketplaces and cafes is exquisite. The prolific film composer Max Steiner, beloved by Hollywood and especially Warner Bros, provides a beautiful score, filled with American themes such as jazz and patriotic songs and French music such as the anthem Marseilles. Claude Rains, in an early film role, plays the stuck-up and somewhat sinister French Captain Renault, who harbors both dislike and envy for Rick. Costumes are by another Hollywood costume designer now forgotten Orry Kelly and provides a look at fashions in the early 40's/WWII Era. This film is worthy of being studied and scrutinized for how to make a great film."

","'Casablanca' is a film every person in the world should see. Even if they're not going to like. This film is simply a must see, to say the very least. But what is it that makes 'Casablanca' a classic? One of things would be the acting, which mostly stands out by Humphrey Bogart. He plays Rick Blaine, a man who lives between two constantly opposing sides - Germans and the french. He watches them tare each other apart and he is like the battlefield. Always stomped over.<br/><br/>Other things that make this film superb are the beautiful music, excellent story line and great portrayal of Casablanca in WWII.<br/><br/>Yet, there are quite a few things that turn me off in this movie. Only one, actually. And that would be the cinematography. It's kind of stiff, uninteresting, lacks a touch of originality, but that is just a minor glitch.

","If Casablanca is only 8.8 out of 10, this is a really tough crowd.<br/><br/>I have seen the movie over 50 times and I find something new every time. It always amazes me what moods and shades the directors and cameramen could create with black-and-white. (The only good thing about seeing the colorized version is that I had never before realized that the thing hanging on the wall in Capt. Renault's office is a map of Africa.) If I ever own a bar, it will be called ""La Belle Aurore"".<br/><br/>Much as I love Bogie and Bergman, my favorite actor in the movie is Clusde Rains. He gets very few gags, but he's the perfect straight man for the zingers written for Bogie."
"bobbaxter","10","1","3","10 July 2006"," Here's Looking at CASABLANCA
","Occasionally, great films are happy accidents. A HARD DAY'S NIGHT and SINGIN' IN THE RAIN were written and produced in unconventional ways. So was CASABLANCA. It was a wartime romantic melodrama based on an unproduced play. Everybody thought that it would be good, but nobody considered it special.<br/><br/>Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman weren't part of the original cast; their roles were originally slated for Ronald Reagan and Ann Sheridan. George Raft was also considered for the lead. Raft and Reagan were unavailable, though, so the role of Rick Blaine went to the only man who could have played it.<br/><br/>The screenplay is another oddity. Julius and Philip Epstein began by extensively revising a stage play called ""Everybody Comes to Rick's"". When the Epsteins were called away to another assignment, Howard Koch took over. Later, the Epsteins returned to collaborate with Koch on the film's final act. Despite the multiple writing credits, the film is very unified.<br/><br/>The film is set in French Morocco in 1941. The port city of Casablanca is a stopping point on the refugee trail. Refugees are pouring into the city, but they can't leave without exit visas. Cafe owner Rick Blaine is accidentally left with two letters of transit, documents which allow the bearer to travel without a visa. No sooner do the letters fall into his hands than his former lover, Ilsa Lund (Bergman) arrives with her husband, Victor Laszlo (Paul Henreid). Laszlo is a charismatic Underground leader sought by the Nazis. Their only hope for escape from Casablanca is the letters of transit held by Rick.<br/><br/>Ilsa is torn between the two men. She loves Rick, but she also loves Laszlo. She realizes that she is the inspiration for his work against the Nazis.<br/><br/>The background for the love triangle is the film's array of memorable supporting characters. Louis Renault (Claude Rains) is the local police chief who trades exit visas for sexual favors. (The film is surprisingly frank about this.) Ugarte (Peter Lorre) is a small-time thief who is arrested for murder. Ferari (Sidney Greenstreet) is a rival club owner and a key figure in the local black market. There are also the employees of Rick's Cafe, led by Sam (Dooley Wilson). The Germans are led by snarling bully Major Heinrich Strasser (Conrad Veidt). All of these characters and their various story threads are introduced in a long series of scenes depicting a typical night at the Cafe.<br/><br/>Movie plots usually follow a three-act structure. CASABLANCA has a more Shakespearean five-act structure. Act 1, which introduces the various characters and subplots, ends with Ilsa's reunion with Rick. Act 2 consists of Rick's reminiscences of his affair with Ilsa. Act 3, which shows Laszlo's futile attempts to get exit visas, ends with his confrontation with a group of Nazis at Rick's. After this, the events of the last two acts (the night of the resistance meeting and the resolution of the love triangle) are inevitable.<br/><br/>Some of the film's plot points are pure fiction. For one thing, there's no such thing as a letter of transit. It's a plot device, a McGuffin. Besides, if the Nazis really wanted a person, no document would prevent them from arresting him. For another, even if Ugarte did get letters of transit, he wouldn't have sold them. He certainly would not have given them to Rick. He would have used them to leave Casablanca. These plot points don't make sense. The Epsteins slide them past us with great dialogue and wonderful characters. After all, if Rick doesn't get the letters, we don't have a movie.<br/><br/>CASABLANCA is a movie about love and sacrifice. It has one of the greatest endings in movie history. In fact, it has the only ending it can possibly have."

","At this point, Casablanca is so universally beloved that it's almost not worth giving it a positive review. But how can I not? Not only is it brilliant on almost every level (except the feminist one-""You'll have to do the thinking for both of us""), but it was the film that first made me into a movie geek. At the end, when Bogie gives up Bergman for the sake of the war, I was just completely stunned. Movies were allowed to end that way? I suddenly realized how much potential there was in the art of the moving picture. It also started my great love affair with Humphrey Bogart. Not conventionally handsome, still he can induce swoons with one heartbroken look."

Another unforgettable lines are ""We will always have Paris"" and ""Roun up the usual suspects"". Wonderful.

"tupchurch","10","1","3","29 May 2006"," fast paced, keeps you guessing, most quotable
","Casablanca is among the most hyped movies of all time. The current generation of viewers who have never seen it will undoubtedly wonder what all the fuss is about. Could a movie that old really be that good? Typically in black-and-whites, the characters are stick-figures, the acting is stiff, the pace moves too slowly, the plot is predictable, the dialog is naive, the production is dated, and therefore the total package will be found lacking in excitement to today's generation. Casablanca has almost none of those traits.<br/><br/>Indeed, the plot of Casablanca is as thick, as multi-layered, as timeless as any movie or play ever written. ""Shakespearean"" comes to mind as an adjective. It has drama, comedy, romance, history, mystery, and you can't guess what will happen next, much less how it will end.<br/><br/>Also as in Shakespeare, the dialog of Casablanca is as quotable as it gets. One liners abound: ""Here's looking at you, kid"" -- is to movies what ""To be or not to be"" is to plays. And the best part is the one-liners come at you not once, twice, or three times, but repeatedly and frequently throughout the movie. Even the very last line is a memorable, quotable jewel for the ages.<br/><br/>But it's more than the quotability factor that makes the dialog great. It's smart. It's so smart that it still sounds ""cool"" by 2006 standards.<br/><br/>The acting in Casablanca, while stiffer that what the current generation sees in movies today, and the production, though Hollywood stage set, are good enough and convincing enough that it would be foolish to try to improve upon them by making a new version of the movie. The best that a modern production could do is borrow or steal from the original--parody it, even, to make something totally new--Indiana Jones being the prime example.<br/><br/>Reviewers often use such superlatives as ""perfect"" or ""near perfect"" when describing Casablanca. They are correct to do so. Anyone watching this movie who finds serious and major flaws, or who gives it a thumbs down, is just not grounded in reality. They must lack a panoramic sense of movie history. . . or just plain history. Concerning movie history, it is not fair to hold a movie made in the 1940s to the exact same standard as a movie made in 2006. For its time, it was as get as they came; and it stands the test of time.<br/><br/>Concerning just plain history, the viewer must have a basic understanding of World War II for the setting of Casablanca to make sense. One doesn't have to be super-knowledgeable about history, one just needs to understand that the Germans attacked France, the French government fell and then (under the name Vichy France) cooperated with the Nazis, but a strong French resistance continued to fight the Germans. Many people were dislocated by the war--some French, some Americans, some from every nationality. This film just happens to portray a few such characters--mostly regular Joe's and Jane's caught in the wrong place at the wrong time and thus stuck in the middle of nowhere in Morocco. Very believable from a historical perspective.<br/><br/>Viewers who don't understand this basic outline of history may not ""get"" the movie the first time (my wife, 42, a very smart, educated RN, but who just ""don't know much about history,"" for example).<br/><br/>Casablanca is, to repeat, one of the most hyped movies of all time. But it lives up to the hype. The reason it gets such high marks from so many millions of viewers is, simply enough, it deserves them."

","This is one of my top 10 favorite films, and it is a landmark in Hollywood history. No one may have known it at the time, but Bogart, Bergman, and the rest of the marvelous crew were putting together a near-flawless script by the Epstein brothers as well as superb acting by the leads. A lot has been made about Bogart and Bergman never talking to each other off screen, but I think that only helped their chemistry. Watch the film again and you can't help but wonder if this isn't the best love story duo ever. Every scene together is so heartwarming and tender it grabs your emotions and doesn't let go. Of course, the ending is perfect since true love contains self-sacrifice, and Rick does just that for Ilsa. A remarkable picture that will stand the test of time. ""Here's looking at you, kid."" - Rick Blaine"
"Hitchcoc","10","1","3","9 March 2006"," One of our most quotable movies
","Not only have countless responders talked about this film; geniuses of the film criticism have picked it apart. Like so many of my most highly rated films, it's all about character. Someone said that modern film audiences don't see it as a classic. I love all kinds of movies. I am disappointed much more with contemporary films than older ones because filmmakers were forced to us a lot more imagination. Granted, there are many bad films in every era as well as great ones. When I see every reviewer start with an evaluation of special effects. Why is it that so many films need to rely on special effects. This movie is a romance of the highest order. It asks so much of its stars. The incredible lighting that accentuates the faces of the characters makes it all work. Then you have real stars in Bogie and Bergmann. Todays actors are so bland and interchangeable for the most part. There was a reason for a star system. Even today, I want to see the less glamorous actors: Hackman, Eastwood, etc. When Bergmann is on the screen, there is no one who can show the passion and pain that she does. Also, consider the vignettes concerning war embattled Casablanca. There is a force at work to destroy all that is good and right. The singing of the French national anthem is antithetical to that scene in Cabaret where the young Nazis sing ""The World Belongs to Me."" See this if you never have."
"kevinmanf","10","1","3","5 March 2006"," It embodies the magic of classic cinema - one of the most watchable of all films
","Casablanca is a fine example of the truism that the great classics never lose there power. With a plot that is apparently simple yet delves into universal themes that are still true today, a series of wonderful characters, some joyous and witty dialogue, a nostalgic score and a great melancholic setting, Casablanca is rightly regarded as one of the treasures of this art. Watch this film as much as you can and you will realise that it achieves what is only in the reach of great movies: it improves with time, uplifting you, purging you, and giving you a taste of what people call, the ""magic of cinema."" The film uses World War II as a device to set two lovers' personal tragedy against the greater larger tragedy that was the war. We have Rick (Humphrey Bogart), a charismatic, cold, hard hearted bar owner who sticks his neck out for nobody and who is going by his duties until one night, his wounds are re-opened with the arrival of Ilsa (Ingrid Bergman). In a series of flashbacks that have always seemed poignant to me, we learn that Rick and Ilsa were once lovers in Paris. Well, that was what Rick thought until the entrance of the Nazi regime in Paris when he was suddenly abandoned by her without any precise explanation. Seeing her in Casablanca accompanied by her husband Victor Laszlo (Paul Henreid) after all those years since Paris brings back those memories he tried so hard to avoid confronting. Why Casablanca, why ""of all the gin joints, in all the towns, in all the world, she had to walk into mine?"" Being hunted by this question is what avoids Rick handing Ilsa and her husband the letters of transit - letters Victor needs to flee the grasp of the Nazi in Casablanca so that he can carry on his fight against this evil.<br/><br/>Rick's cafe is, metaphorically speaking, the other great character in the film. It's exotic in look and evokes a feeling of fascination. I've always thought that the contrast between the nazi terror the outside world is embroiled in with the mostly joyful and the adventurous atmosphere of Rick's Cafe provides an element of hope and security the film needs. It also provides the setting for which a series of fascinating characters and adventures are displayed. In it, we have Major Strasser, the German officer who will do all it takes to make sure Victor never leaves Casablanca (that would be too dangerous for the Nazis), Ugarte (Peter Lorre) the strange thief who stole the letters of transit and gave them to Rick arguing that ""I (he) have many a friend in Casablanca, but somehow, just because you despise me, you are the only one I trust."" But of all the characters (including Sam the piano player whose song ""As Time Goes By"" remains immortal and Sydney Greenstreet as Signor Ferrari, the man who can get you anything), none is more fascinating nor brings me the most pause than Captain Renault (Claude Rains) in a landmark performance. He is a corrupt officer, but likable, funny and because he attempts to understand the persona of Rick, he provides the ultimate link between the audience and the movie's hero. Humphrey Bogart gives what is perhaps his most recognised performance; there is a certain charm in the way he talks, smokes, sidesteps adversities and pretends he is a tough guy whilst we can sense a hidden wound inside him. And Ingrid Bergman just shines the screen: she is the innocent beauty the film needs to emphasize Rick's initial cruelty towards her and in the end, his courage and kindness.<br/><br/>Casablanca is above all, about self sacrifice; sacrificing personal interests for a better universe, for the defeat of the Nazi regime, for a better society in a world filled with evil. The famous final sequence is so direct in its manifestation of this that it works more like a parable than a sequence in a movie. In times of despair when there is little hope, Casablanca is one of the film's I turn to for hope and redemption. There are countless of great sequences each with something exciting happening. To me the greatest and most meaningful is when some Nazi soldiers gather round the piano and sing an ominous song to the ""Fatherland"". It makes everyone in the Rick's cafe very uncomfortable. That's when Paul Heinried instructs the orchestra to play the French national anthem, the""Marseilles"". Everyone starts to sing. The Nazis are silenced. The music takes over. I found my eyes on the verge of tears.<br/><br/>This is an undisputed masterpiece, a treasure that remains fresh with each viewing."
"creekin111","10","1","3","12 February 2006"," My #10 favorite film of all time
","To see Casablanca's poetry on screen is like witnessing the Sistine Chapel for the first time. Like a fine bottle of perfectly aged wine, its complexities are seemingly endless. It only gets better with time. To quote Bogart in The Maltese Falcon, this truly is the ""stuff that dreams are made of."" Easily the greatest romance ever to be produced on celluloid. Casablanca blends the genres of musicals, drama, romance, war, film noir, suspense, a little comedy, and a touch of mystery so seamlessly it is easy to forget that at its very heart and soul is a romantic picture.<br/><br/>It pacing is almost frantic from beginning to end. The use of shadows and lighting are so vivid and fascinating that it is probably the best looking beautiful B&W film ever made. The most memorable lines in movie history and the most amount of memorable lines in movie history.<br/><br/>I don't expect people who dislike romances to like Casablanca. Its dialogue, characters and songs have been so familiar, it hardly even seems as fresh as it should be. But like witnessing the Sistine chapel for the first time, you know what its like. But its another thing to see it completely for yourself."

The script is deliciously witty and full of drama, the characters wonderfully crafted and 3-dimensional, the cinematography and sound as classy as anything in its day.

As great as the cinematography and editing is in Citizen Kane, the writing and acting in this film is of another order of magnitude. There is one unforgettable performance after another- Bogart, Bergman, Claude Rains, Paul Henreid, Sidney Greenstreet, Peter Lorre, Conrad Veidt, Dooley Wilson, S.Z. Sakall.

"hall895","8","1","3","12 January 2006"," Still a classic as time goes by
","It is easy to see why Casablanca is one of the most beloved films of all time. There's something for everyone...romance, intrigue, suspense and humor. There's a great story here, driven by some truly memorable characters who are brought to life by terrific acting performances. Everyone will remember Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman in the lead roles but the performances of a number of actors in smaller roles are brilliant as well and vital to the film's success. A film about a rather unique city and unique situation during a very specific time period, World War II, Casablanca still holds up today as a terrific achievement.<br/><br/>In the film, Casablanca, a city in the French Morocco, serves as an exit route for refugees seeking to escape the encroaching Nazis. Freedom is not easy to come by. In a plot contrivance created to drive the story forward two letters of transit, which will allow anyone to leave Casablanca with no questions asked, end up in the hands of Rick Blaine, played by Bogart. Rick owns the café in Casablanca which will be the center of most of the activity in the film. He has carved out a comfortable existence for himself amongst all the chaos the war has created around him. As we meet him, Rick is cynical, jaded, not interested in sticking his neck out for anyone. Bogart brings all of this out with a truly memorable performance. Then Ilsa, as played by Bergman walks into his life. Or shall I say, back into his life, because we shall soon see that Rick and Ilsa are far from being strangers. Here is part of the genius of Casablanca, as by going back in time we learn so much more about the man Rick was and begin to understand why he is the man he has become. Soon, Rick's rather comfortable life will be turned upside down as the film moves toward its truly memorable conclusion.<br/><br/>Bogart is undeniably brilliant and his scenes with Bergman are remarkable, filled with passion, intrigue and some of the most memorable dialogue ever put to film. But all the Bogart-Bergman hoopla ignores so much of what makes Casablanca great. As resistance leader Victor Laszlo, the other man in Ilsa's life, Paul Henreid is easily overlooked, perhaps seen as the third wheel. But his character is undeniably vital to the story and Henreid plays it with great conviction and talent. Conrad Veidt as the requisite bad guy, Nazi Major Strasser, gives a fine performance. As Sam, the piano player at Rick's, Dooley Wilson provides some memorable songs you may well find yourself still humming hours after the movie ends. Peter Lorre, Sydney Greenstreet, S.K. Sakall...all have small but memorable, well-acted roles. And stealing quite a few scenes is Claude Rains as Captain Renault. Much of the humor in the film comes from Rains' terrific performance.<br/><br/>A classic for its time, Casablanca holds up remarkably well today. Some of the dialogue and situations may seem a little hokey by modern standards but that doesn't really detract from the experience at all. Casablanca gives us truly memorable characters, places them into a unique situation and then races towards a fascinating conclusion. One would think that Casablanca will always be remembered fondly, no matter how much time goes by."

So quintessential, so replayed, again and again and again (Sam)?<br/><br/>This is a myth, an archetype, a riddle.<br/><br/>For my money this is Oedipus Rex. I like Freud, hell. Indeed it is better than Freud or Sophocles, but it is dealing with the same issue. <br/><br/>Dad: Lazlo <br/><br/>Mum: Ilsa <br/><br/>Son: Rick<br/><br/>The love triangle that repeats in our culture forever is played out perfectly in this movie. <br/><br/>Rick and Ilsa had the perfect relationship, before them Nazi's arrived. <br/><br/>Man and woman before the arrival of oppression, rules, the crunch. They lived, in the permanent idyllic past of Paris. A Paris always in spring. No need for anything there except love. Champagne every day. No promises. <br/><br/>But we, viewers, live in a real world. We need ideals. We may reject the signs, we may live in a Morocco of our dreams, but that only leads to an alcoholic, moratorium. Victor Lazlo bit the bullet. He is the man. The man that Rick has not, at the beginning of the movie, become. <br/><br/>Were it not for the ultimate hard boiled machismo of Humphrey Bogart, this film would have been unbearable.

Of going out with a yes saying, ""okay anything goes"", woman, other, mother. <br/><br/>So much for Freud. But what about Lacan? Jacques Lacan tells us another Oedipal story via Edgar Allen Poe's ""purloined letter."" <br/><br/>Personally I don't understand Lacan at all. But Casablanca is the story that makes me want to.

","This is one of the best movies of all time. Anyone who claims to be a fan of the movies needs to see this film. The story, ostensibly about people fleeing the nazi's in World War Two could be set anywhere there are refugees today. There are oppressors, people seeking a better life, those that prey on them and the cynical ones that float with the tides. The whole range of human emotions and activities are seen in this movie. <br/><br/>Bogie was never better than he was as Rick, the owner of a cafe in Casablanca where the refugees hang out gambling and drinking and waiting for their chance to leave. Ingrid Bergman was never better than she was as Ilsa Lund, Rick's former lover and husband of resistance leader Victor Lazlo(Paul Henreid). The interplay between Bogie and Bergman would make this film one of the best. But there's more. The ensemble cast includes some of the best character actors together in one film. Peter Lorre and Sydney Greenstreet put in strong performances(albeit brief ones) as those who prey on the refugees. Claude Raines, the chief of police, is the perfect bureaucrat who rolls with the tides supporting whoever is on top and knowing it will change. While Bogie never did say 'here's looking at you, kid,"", Raines did say ""round up the usual suspects.""<br/><br/>I won't spoil the ending, but if you're not crying because of Bogie's nobility and Bergmans pure love for both Rick and her husband, you're not human. This movie is a 10."
"loza-1","10","1","3","5 July 2005"," I'll tell you what this film is about.
","What is this film about? All sorts of explanations have been put forward. It's a romance, a melodrama - even the intriguing explanation that it was the representation of a love triangle involving the director, a notion which falls flat, because the director did not write the script. In fact, it is a good old fashioned war propaganda film. Why should the Americans enter the Second World War?<br/><br/>Although the film is set in North Africa, all the principal characters are either American or from somewhere in Europe. The Americans are from a country that is ""neutral."" Most of the others, the French, the Czech with the Hungarian name etc, are embroiled in the war somewhere.<br/><br/>Among all the turmoil in Casablanca Rick Blaine has built himself a little neutral island. It's cosy, with his chess set in his little office, with Dooley Wilson at the piano, and Sasha the Russian barman. The turmoil can go on but Rick Blaine, like the USA, is strictly neutral.<br/><br/>But Rick cannot remain neutral for long, and sooner or later, the second world war - in the shape of Ilsa and her boyfriend - turn up at his door. Rick must now take an active part in the war, just as the USA have to join the fighting.<br/><br/>The final scene show the beginning of a beautiful friendship between the reluctant collaborator of a Frenchman and his American ally.<br/><br/>The film may have been a message to the people of America or even a message to the President (casablanca is Spanish for white house). But the message is there. It's 1942, and it's off to war for the USA; because it is inevitable that the USA are going to get embroiled in this one way or another.<br/><br/>Those who have read some of my other reviews know that I am quite capable of slitting the throats of sacred cows. In this case I am quite happy to give it 10 out of 10, because it IS a good film; and it is not the pseudo-intellectuals who will tell you it is a good film; it is the ordinary filmgoing public who will tell you. It is heavily layered, well acted, competently directed, and Orson Welles is nowhere to be seen!<br/><br/>There are some reviewers who say that the acting in this is bad. When did Bogart, Bergman, Claude Rains or Conrad Veidt ever act badly? They couldn't if they tried.<br/><br/>No other director but Curtiz could have directed this. Interesting is the scene where two factions sing against one another, a device he has used in at least one other of his films. For this film, Curtiz won an about-time-too Oscar for best director.<br/><br/>Another great thing about this film is that it is so rich in content that you can play it again, Sam, as often as you like."

","As Leonard Maltin says, ""everything's right"" in this movie about Vichy-occupied Casablanca in World War II. Bogie is the ambiguously ex-patriot proprietor of Rick's Cafe with Wilson as his loyal sidekick; Rains is the amoral (or is he?) local constabulary; Greenstreet is the owner of a neighboring saloon; Lorre does a stretch as a conniving weasel. Then Bogart's old flame Ingrid blows into town with resistance leader Henreid in tow and everything goes upside down. Almost every line is a gem, whether it bristles (most of them) or is so overdone as to be awesomely camp. The only arguably slow part (and it suffers only in comparison) is the extended Paris flashback. I think this is Bogart's signature performance, a notch or two above his (or pretty much anyone else's) best work. Bergman is breathtaking as his old girlfriend; and all the supporting characters shine in their own way, particularly Rains, who may actually have as many memorable lines as Bogart. Worth multiple viewings, it gets better each time. I've seen lots of great movies but never really question whether this was the best."
"jay4stein79-1","Null","1","3","3 November 2004"," The Greatest?
","Leonard Maltin and his gang say that Casablanca represents the greatest achievement in the history of Hollywood movie making - the zenith of the Golden Age Dream Factory. Roger Ebert decided to make it the first in his series of reviews entitled The Great Movies. Lists of the ten best films of all time place it generally in the top-5. It even made the top ten best films on a list that places the Lord of the Rings trilogy higher than, oh, just about anything.<br/><br/>Is Casablanca that great? Briefly, yes it is. Is it my favorite film or would I ever describe it as the greatest movie ever made? That is unlikely, but I will concede that they may be right to anyone who wants to argue that point. If you tell me it's the greatest movie of all time, I will say, you might be right. If you tell me the Lord of the Rings trilogy is, I will challenge you to a duel a la Zell Miller.<br/><br/>Truth be told, Casablanca is my third favorite movie and I believe it is one of the greatest motion pictures ever created. It is one of the few true works of art the Hollywood system ever created. Like most great movies, though, it always begs the question - what's so special? Well, for starters, Michael Curtiz had, perhaps, the greatest cast of characters ever. You have the greatest male movie-star of all time playing the lead; you have a truly gifted and beautiful female lead; you have three of the greatest character actors ever in Sydney Greenstreet, Peter Lorre, and Paul Henreid.<br/><br/>Second, you have an epic story condensed into a two-hour run time. The story has everything - murder mystery, war time thriller, espionage tale, love story, etc. As Umberto Eco pointed out in an essay, Casablanca is a collage of story types and moods; it has something for everyone.<br/><br/>Third, and most importantly, it has the greatest movie ending of all time. As Rick watches Illsa's plane taxi down the Casablancan runway and he spouts that memorable line, you are shot through with a feeling that you have just been privy to something that is so perfect and right and you are amazed because, really, that ending would never make it to the final cut of a Hollywood film today. The bittersweetness of that ending is exactly what the narrative to that point calls for. Rick needs to stay; Illsa needs to go. Anything else would be trite and contrived.<br/><br/>(As an aside, I was once at a bar having drinks with these two girls, one of whom I found incredibly attractive. I contemplated making a move with her and then the conversation turned to movies. She said, ""Casablanca is my favorite movie. It's soooo wonderful. I would just change the ending, though, so Rick and Illsa stay together."" I gagged and discontinued any plans for romantic pursuits I had intended to embark upon with her.) Casablanca is as close to perfection as Golden Age Hollywood ever came. It's a perfect, timeless movie that, I believe, every one can and will enjoy. If you have not seen it, do yourself a favor and rent it. It's wonderful."

","A perfect example of how a great script carries the movie through along with the most apt choice of actors. Bogart is brilliant and Bergman is arguably the most beautiful actress to have graced the silver screen. Bogart's characteristic dialogue delivery coupled with a well matched background score add to the atmosphere of a romance gone bad in the midst of the war. The genius of Casablanca lies in the fact that instead of introducing many characters, the makers of the movie have concentrated on just a few and developed them completely in the movie. At the end you feel as if you know Bogart, Bergman, the French detective and even Sam, the piano player. One of the best movies ever made - only to be matched 53 years later by the greatest movie of all time - Pulp Fiction."

","Favored among many movie enthusiasts, Casablanca is a well-made American classic. The film gives the audience a taste of the atmosphere that existed in Casablanca, Morocco during the Nazi regime of WWII. In the film, Casablanca is the destination for anyone who didn't want to be found. For the criminals, escapees and the refugees fleeing from Nazi oppression, Casablanca was not only a safe haven, but also a gateway to a Hitler-free world.<br/><br/>There in Casablanca, exists a popular nightclub called Rick's, where most of these stowaways end up as they wait for their ticket out of the country. It's a trendy gin joint with gambling, music and drinking that ironically reflects the atmosphere of the country or 'safe haven' Rick originates from, America, 'The Land of The Free'. At Rick's, the only 'American' nightclub in Casablanca, people from all backgrounds and cultures are welcome to relax and hang out without being persecuted, prosecuted or detained. It retains the party atmosphere and indulges in the carefree lifestyle that America commonly depicts. But beneath it all, lies the underground network of allies made up of intrigue, meticulous scheming and corrupt officials. In the middle of this soup of deceptiveness and illegality is Rick, standing neutral and bold.<br/><br/>Rick Blaine (Humphrey Bogart) is a man who stands alone and looks out for no one but himself. By holding onto that pitiless tough-guy persona he reveals to the crowd, he's able to hide emotion and stray away from heartache, which as the film progresses, takes the focus away from the romance and the Nazis and places it on Rick's struggle to redefine himself. Bogart's brilliant characterization harmonizes beautifully with the performance of the stunning Ingrid Bergman, who plays Rick's old flame Ilsa 'Kid' Laslo. Together this romantic duo set the screen on fire as the sexual tension mounts between them.<br/><br/>Technically speaking, the film didn't use any groundbreaking techniques with the lighting, camera work, or sound. For this film in particular, simple was good. No special effects, innovative camera movements or directing methods generated an uncomplicated love story that the audience could easily focus on.<br/><br/>With quotable quotes and original an story line, there is no wonder why this film is a favorite to many. It's perfect for anyone who adores a good love story. Certainly not one of the greatest films ever made, it is however, one of the most influential films ever made, which justifies its status as an American classic."

","`Casablanca'<br/><br/>	You can find the color in this black and white movie's dialogue.  The writers produced script with deep characters that exchange witty dialogue throughout the movie's interesting plot.  `Casablanca' opens in the foreign city of.....Casablanca.  The world is in turmoil and the drama flares inside the city walls.  European emigrants flee from the German war machine to Casablanca, the gateway to America.  But in the midst of the carnage and despair of the world war, Humphrey Bogart is having some love troubles.  And the personal demons Bogart struggles with has entertained audiences for decades. 	Bogart plays the character Rick who is perfectly cynical.  He is a man who `sticks his neck out for no one.', and it would seem that Rick doesn't love for no one either.  Not since Ilsa (Ingrid Bergman) broke his heart in Paris.   Rick is soon dragged, kicking and screaming, into a love triangle worthy of Jerry Springer when Ilsa comes to Casablanca with a husband on her arm.  Rick must face his demons, define his values, and make a choice between his happiness or the hope of the world. 	In a film that oozes with Americana the viewer might find an allegory in Casablanca.  Rick could be a neutral America who tried to keep their feet dry when the world around it was drowning.  And Ilsa could symbolize a desperate Europe, who's only hope is in America.  There are striking similarities between the characters and the world at the time of World War II. 	When combined, the acting, the original and complex story, the clever writing, Casablanca holds all the elements of a classic film.  It has entertained audiences for years and therefore transcends time. Though Casablanca may be for a more mature movie goer, it is worth seeing if your ready to be weaned off of Hollywood's recycled movies.  There is a very good reason why Casablanca is one of the most quoted movies in film history, and that reason should compel everyone to see a piece of American history.  Or, `You'll regret it.  Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but soon and for the rest of your life.'"

","Rick escapes war-torn Europe to open a dubious night-club in Africa, but his life is turned upside down by an old flame.<br/><br/>So regularly viewed and reviewed, that I'll keep it short for fear of sending you to sleep; but I'd like to make three quick observations.<br/><br/>1. Is Bogart (Rick) really in love with Bergman (Ilse)? If so why does he act like he does? Sacrifice means doing something you don't really want to do, but you do it for the general good. He has moved on with his life (he could have returned to the USA after Europe) and maybe doesn't want to turn back the clock? Equally, in the final reel, he merely acts to expedite the moment. This doesn't mean events could not progress later.<br/><br/>2. Casablanca has the same smoke (fog, in Africa?) and hardboard sets that Warners used for every production around that time.<br/><br/>3. Bogart never indicates who's side he is on until the picture winds down. Through image and viewing film we learn the truth, but that would be no good for a person watching the film for the first time or not being prive to the Bogart image. Surely things should have been at least hinted at earlier?<br/><br/>We are among pro's here - and better still pros having acres of luck. Great casting (every one a winner!) and non more so than having the king of cool in the lead.  Also a  lesson in scripting with enough wisecracks to lighten the load, and the wisdom to keep build to a (great) climax<br/><br/>(Many ""great"" films are merely great intro's and climaxes. This is what the audience remembers. Just look at Jaws, for example.)<br/><br/>This is movie making from a factory, not an art-house. Here you didn't politic for two years before you even start on production, you just got on with it. People involved here made three movies a year and thought nothing of it. This produced a lot of dross, but it produced just as much quality as the more measured and indulgent systems that followed."

","Casablanca is a great movie with strong acting and script.  But I don't think it's THE best or top 10 movies of all time. I haven't seen that many classics, but in comparison, it lacks the complexity and inventiveness of Citizen Kane.  Gone With the Wind, as melodramatic as it is, has astounding cinematography/sets, strong performances and 2 memorable characters instead of 1 (i.e. Rick.  Ilsa and Victor are rather 1-dimensional, the script's fault, not acting).  With the same strong ensemble performance, All About Eve's wittiness would blow Casablanca's script away.<br/><br/>Of course, Casablanca is a nice package of romance, suspense and action, but it is not without its flaws.  The Paris scenes felt subpar and corny to the rest of the movie.  Besides, Rick already seems cynical back in Paris.  So it hinders the supposed transformation after Ilsa left him.  As mentioned above, Ilsa and Victor are bland characters.  Louis' transformation in the end is incredulous.  The plot is predictable.  Can't you see it coming that Rick still has a golden heart, that Victor & Ilsa would escape Casablanca, that even the bad Nazi gets what he deserved.  All in all, it feels more ""black and white"" and dated than other classics, and it's not just because the movie is set during WW2."

","CASABLANCA is probably Hollywood's most famous, slickly made (but corny) WW 2 propaganda film, and it is somewhat amazing how decades of promotion have made people think it is a love story between Rick and Ilsa. It is a love story between Rick and his mercenary soldiering and how that love is rekindled.<br/><br/>When we meet Rick he is running a club, but we are told that he used to fight fascists in Spain. When he meets Ilsa in Paris he has given up his military duties. She disappears and he is miserable, but he seems to have forgotten about it until she shows up.
But it is Victor who is the focus of Rick's attention. He admires Victor Lazlo--as a rebel leader. When Rick puts Ilsa on the plane, he says it plainly--Victor needs Ilsa for his work, and that is more important than their love. If Ilsa leaves Victor, it could lead to the fascists winning WW 2. Preventing that is more important to Rick.<br/><br/>The message is in essence, war trumps love. In EL CID he gets married and then has to leave his wife to lead his men--but in that case, it is loyalty to his comrades and his nation--they ask him to lead him. Rick, on the other hand, is an international idealist--going to Spain to fight Franco had nothing to do with American patriotism. And we see in the story that money doesn't mean everything to him either.<br/><br/>He remains committed to his anti-fascist beliefs, but he lacks the desire to get back into fighting--until he spends time with Lazlo. Ilsa is the catalyst for him realizing that fighting is more important to him than their love.<br/><br/>It also seems that Ilsa loves Rick more than Victor--but Rick is telling her she has to stay with Victor out of duty to the war effort!<br/><br/>Maybe this is why Renault comes across as the most genuine character. He is corrupt but compelled by self-interest. He changes sides like a pragmatist, and he likes Rick, so he can't turn him over to the Germans. The rest of the movie's characters are puppets for a heavy-handed message."

It has a lot of scenes that just feel to me like filler, as they don't contribute in any truly meaningful way. The action, especially the shooting, felt stiff and unnatural.

","Casablanca was designed to encourage the USA into war against Germany in WW2. It failed wholeheartedly, but it didn't matter, the Japs and Hitler invited them in to the fray.<br/><br/>It was also a vehicle for the stupendously subservient actress Ingrid Bergman. Her eyes water every time a male performs a miraculous act such as serving a drink or lighting a cigarette, or god forbid singing a national anthem. The use of cigarettes and booze to create an atmosphere is the primary reason why this movie is so detested today. Those habits simply don't gel with the health-conscious viewers of the 21st century. <br/><br/>But see past that and the characters in this movie are still absorbing. Asides from Bogie, Claude Rains and Peter Lorre represent people we all know. What is a bit of mystery, is why the movie was not set in Lisbon rather than Casablanca. Lisbon was infamous as the spy capital of the war and was the historical source for Ian Fleming's James Bond romp in Casino Royale(re-located to western France in the book). Perhaps it was because it was already known that the Torch landings were to take place in Morocco.<br/><br/>One of my favourite Bogie movies, but only 3rd behind To Have And Have Not and Key Largo.

The romantic aspect of it was enjoyable and the twists at the end. It wasn't really my kind of story, but I liked it regardless."
"kendraocon","7","1","4","11 October 2012"," Not as good as I expected!
","This movie was not as good as I expected it to be. I think that the cinematographer's moves were great though. He had a lot of techniques involved in it. He used a tilt shot, showing the plane in the sky then the camera was tilted to show the men and women watching the sky. I thought it was a nice move, it was missing any pieces there because it was a nice clean shot. They use low key lighting, were the shadows were almost over emphasized. The women were highlighted and shown in a beautiful way, especially Isla. They also made sure she didn't have too many harsh shadows on her face. They had the perfect tonal range in the light, that helped show the emotions of the characters the best. The director had used a lot of minor characters , which confused me a bit. I was confused between Rick and Victor, I found that there was not much a strong difference between the two of them that really stood out to me.The cinematographer always used the best techniques to show of the characters, in the beginning showing off Sam in the restaurant they start off at a far distance, but then gradually zoom in almost as if it is a slow motion shot of Sam singing and playing the piano."

","This was a pretty okay romantic drama film that I would never watch again. However, I was not moved by this movie at all. I mean, it was long and boring not keeping my interest what so ever. I can say there were some parts that had me wondering but then it just fell apart in front of me as I watch. Most people say this movie is also a classic but because I'm not a fan of movies like these, I say different. I did understand from the ending, the man that let the lady go was torn between love and virtue. He only did what was right for her and didn't think of himself. The ending of this movie was really delightful. I like how at the end he and the man walk together into the fog. In all this movie was acceptable but I will never think to watch it again."

The photography was excellent and uses many different types of shots to really expose the film as much as possible and give you good views on conversations and the actions by following the 180 - rule. The sound was in sync and sounded great and not muffled or distant like some movies seem. I'd just like to note that I saw the original black & white film and it had a great picture.<br/><br/>Overall I rated it an 8 out of 10 because it was was a great movie however it just doesn't tell as good of a story as many other drama's that I have seen including ""Seven Pounds"" and ""Forrest Gump""."

","The director of this really knew what he was doing from lighting to camera angle. Every shot seemed well planned out before they even started filming. In some movies you can tell when they just threw in another scene here and there but not in this movie. Also the lighting on the each characters face was right on the money and allowed the viewer to really connect with every character. the camera angles allowed you to really enjoy the back ground as much as the characters in them, giving you a whole new spectrum of feeling. The feelings of World War II is also well shown in Casablanca (1942). The they talk about the war and the actors really doing a good job channeling the feelings of war and really there characters. Over all I would highly recommend this movie to anyone!"
"paul2001sw-1","7","1","4","18 September 2010"," Surprisingly modern
","Watching 'Casablanca' for the first time one is struck by a number of things: the already-known dialogue (though of course, not including the exact line, ""Play it again, Sam"", which no-one actually says); the swanky nature of Rick's bar, the very un-African nature of Casablanca in general and the fact that Sam, although a minor character, is a black man presented as intelligent and even a friend of the Humphrey Bogart's hero, in a way that can't have been completely normal in 1942. I also like the way that Sam's music is integrated into the film, although in places the soundtrack overdoes the romantic notes. It's also interesting to think about the story-lines chosen by film-makers before the war was won, although the film isn't quite as detached from the allied cause as it first suggests. Overall, it's aged much better than most films of its era, probably because it's mainly a character study, albeit one supported by a heavy dose of wisecracking; and it's stateless characters, drifting through a world that has lost it's certainties, live beyond the bounds of conventional morality in a very matter-of-fact way. Of course it won Oscars, but a comparison with the modern day is telling; in how many contemporary blockbusters does the hero let his girl go?"

","A truly perfect movie, the 1942 Casablanca still wows viewers today, and for good reason. Its unique story of a love triangle set against terribly high stakes in the war against a monster is sophisticated instead of outlandish, intriguing instead of garish. Humphrey Bogart plays the allegedly apolitical club owner in unoccupied French territory that is nevertheless crawling with Nazis; Ingrid Bergman is the lover who mysteriously deserted him in Paris; and Paul Heinreid is her heroic, slightly bewildered husband. Claude Rains, Sydney Greenstreet, Peter Lorre, and Conrad Veidt are among what may be the best supporting cast in the history of Hollywood films. This is certainly among the most spirited and ennobling movies ever made."

"johnnyboyz","9","1","4","20 July 2006"," A lot of people say: 'Casablanca is the greatest film ever'  Well, it's definitely one of them.
","Casablanca has stood the test of time in a number of different ways. Given the time and circumstances under which this film was made, it's very easy to see why so many generations have warmed to it.<br/><br/>Casablanca leaps into action very impressively; in-fact there is hardly ever a dull moment in this film, contrary to what some people say. The beginning is quick and sets everything up very nicely. We're made aware of the situation, the setting and exactly what goes on here. The little thing the narrator mentions about the German soldiers being killed and some papers missing whets our appetite. It stays at the back of our mind for a while. We also get a good look at our hero's bar/casino and what goes on/who goes there. It's done fairly quickly and very professionally. Never boring, and that's the key adjective to mention. In-fact, the amount of characters we are introduced to is rather effective as we don't really learn too much about them all at once, creating an eerie suspicion about them.<br/><br/>The technique of building up a yet unseen character through dialogue is at large here, albeit briefly. The person in question is the eventual 'girl' of the film and we are told that she's been through hell already with a certain someone yet didn't leave them creating the atmosphere that she's someone special who sees things through to the end. This adds to the surprise our hero and us feel when we realise just exactly who it is.<br/><br/>The hero's bar is the setting for most of the early exchanges and the mellow music that flows throughout is very nice and adds to the on screen atmosphere. The dialogue Rick (Bogart) is given also adds to the film as we're forced into believing he's a certain type of person: witty, cynical, quick and clever. He doesn't stray away from habits and routines, either. So, when the bombshell arrives and he's suddenly breaking these traits we've come to see him never stray away from, we know something's wrong. Something or someone has forced him into straying away from his own self and suddenly become more serious about things. The dialogue mentioned earlier has done its job and we're hooked.<br/><br/>This is shown to us through an effective flashback sequence, which are memories in Rick's mind. The thing here in a filmic sense is that this could've happened at the start of the film, followed by a caption: 'xx years later'. The fact the makers didn't use this standard technique is evidence enough it's different for the good. Similar to 'Citizen Kane' a year earlier; the story is told, briefly, through means of time/space manipulation and it works very well if you've already been caught up in the film.<br/><br/>Casablanca never wonders away from its story line or characters. The routine romance plot is maintained throughout and comic quips are thrown in as well once Rick is forced to change. With a script which has stood the test of time like no other and that feeling of tragedy and emptiness flowing throughout, it's no wonder 'we'll always have Casablanca'."

"silverscreen888","7","1","4","22 June 2005"," A Stirring and Splendidly-Made Wartime Film; Very Well-Acted
","Julius Epstein, one of the writers of ""Casablanca's"" screenplay, has called his script bad names. On philosophical grounds, I must agree with some of his honest objections. However, the production values and general storyline are so beautifully done in this famous cinematic work of art that the film's sterling qualities easily outweigh its relatively minor defects. Of course, the film is somewhat overrated by most moviegoers; but, its scenes and human relationships rank with some of the finest achievements in Hollywood's history. And the acting is far above average, every last line of it. It is to this presentational aspect--and to the characters' motives within the film that perhaps viewers have always responded unusually favorably. The film was set in occupied North Africa during wartime. Between the Vichy French government and the Nazi occupiers, the criminal element and those desperate enough to be driven to commit crimes, the city was a deceptively-calm-appearing and yet a very-dangerous place to be living in those years. And, incidentally, it provided a fine milieu in which to set a dramatic film whose theme is how men ought to face their responsibilities in emergencies. The only way to escape from Casblanca's oasis of deceptive peacefulness was to have ""papers""--legal permission to persuade the authorities to permit such a departure. In fact, the storyline begins with visitors having such papers stolen, by a desperate man who is later killed. The remainder of the plot line can be summed up in two sentences. In the city, an expatriate named Rick runs a large nightspot to whom sooner or later, because he is neutral and accommodating, everybody comes. Enter Ilse, and Viktor Laszlo, she the woman who inexplicably left him in Paris and the man she left him to go back to, a man wanted by the Nazis everywhere as their chief opponent... What happens after this is the outcome of the sorts of people Rick, Ilse and Viktor are, and an enigmatic French police captain beautifully played by Claude Rains. As Rick, Humphrey Bogart is at his best, investing a neutral and too-much-unaccounted-for obvious ex-racketeer with intelligence, a sense of honor and melancholia for his lost love. Ingrid Bergman has little to do but look beautiful and say she is sorry, but she does both wonderfully, as always. Paul Henried as Laszlo is straightforward and capable Others in the very fine cast include Syndey Greenstreet as a rival nightclub owner, S.Z. Sakall the bartender, Leonid Kinskey a larcenous employee, Joy Page as a desperate refugee, Peter Lorre as the unfortunate thief, Dooley Wilson as Rick's segundo and piano player, and able Conrad Veidt as the Nazis' chief. Michael Curtiz's bravura direction controls the film's pace and draws very good performances from his cast. Every element of the film glows with intelligence; the lighting is extraordinary, and the costumes, sets, art direction by Carl Weyl, and Arthur Edeson's cinematography are textbook-class work. Mention should be made of Max Steiner's music and the song ""As Times G By"", first heard in this feature. Scenes such as the entry of Ilse into Rick's, the roulette wheel payoff, the rival singing of the Marseillaise to drown out the Nazis' song, the killing of the thief, the closing of Rick's and the justly-famous climax at the airport in the fog need no elaboration by me. What is questionable is the ending, in which Rick gives up Ilse, at least for now, because Viktor Laszlo needs her; the stronger ending would have been for Laszlo to give her up to Rick and say, ""Do you think so little of me as to imagine I'd let you do a 'sacrifice'? I need only my liberty, as every man does. I have my work--it's enough for me for now. Happiness such as yours and the freedom to enjoy it again is what I'm fighting for. What we're all fighting for! So, we go on together or not at all."" But this flaw is less important than the careful build in tension achieved within the film, less vital than the gradual awakening of righteous anger in men who had stayed out of the battle between brutality and justice too long already. The film has a great deal to say about what men should do in the face of evil; and much of the time, it says it very well indeed."

"SnoopyStyle","9","1","5","4 October 2014"," Movie romanticism at its best
","Casablanca is a desperate place during WWII. Refugees escaping the Nazis travel a back route through Casablanca to Lisbon and then to the free world. Some can go no further than the French colony which is home to scoundrels, smugglers, double dealers, and freedom fighters. Rick Blaine (Humphrey Bogart) is a world wearied expat American who runs a popular nightspot Rick's. He sticks his neck out for nobody. Captain Louis Renault (Claude Rains) leads the local police. He's eager to catch the underground leader Victor Laszlo to please the Germans. Ugarte (Peter Lorre) is a sweaty people-smuggler who is selling 2 letters of transit stolen from 2 German couriers. He gives the valuable letters for Rick to hide. Much to Rick's surprise, Lazslo arrives with his old flame Ilsa Lund (Ingrid Bergman).<br/><br/>It's hard to quantify everything that is so great about this movie. Bogie as the Rick is one of those movie icons that transcends even the movie world. The desperation is well projected. This is melodrama of the highest order and the best of the genre. Sometimes movies come along at the right time. This is a propaganda film at the perfect time where the theme of sacrifice hit hardest. This is the standard bearer for movie romanticism as much as Romeo and Juliet for plays. Some can complain about Paul Henreid's stiffness as Laszlo but that's the point of his character. Some others can complain about the effects but that's missing the point of the movie entirely. Some can complain about all the clichés, and I agree that this movie is one big cliché. So what? In the end, this is a movie that deserves every bit of its iconic status."

","In World War II Casablanca, Rick Blaine, exiled American and former freedom fighter, runs the most popular nightspot in town. The cynical lone wolf Blaine comes into the possession of two valuable letters of transit. When Nazi Major Strasser arrives in Casablanca, the sycophantic police Captain Renault does what he can to please him, including detaining Czech underground leader Victor Laszlo. Much to Rick's surprise, Lazslo arrives with Ilsa, Rick's one time love. Rick is very bitter towards Ilsa, who ran out on him in Paris, but when he learns she had good reason to, they plan to run off together again using the letters of transit. Well, that was their original plan.... <br/><br/>During the first few scenes in Rick's nightclub, issues of World War II are shown through the mixed customers of Vichy French and Nazi officials, refugees, and thieves. On top of that, tensions between the Vichy French and French patriots are shown in one pivotal scene, where a group of Nazi officers, led by Strasser, sing a German patriotic song, while Laszlo and the rest of the crowd sing the French national anthem, eventually drowning out the Germans.<br/><br/>Casablanca is a classic, with Citizen Kane and The Godfather. Everyone knows that. But if you know me, I usually find classics like these overrated, because I set high expectations for these films before watching the movies that, in the end, I am left disappointed. Casablanca is no different. No, the movie isn't bad by any means. In fact, I think the movie will grow on me after I watch it several times. However, right now, I don't seem to be getting the hype.<br/><br/>I liked the performance by Humphrey Bogart, as the unemotional, bitter man. He plays it quite well. Ingrid Bergman plays decently alongside him, both having a good chemistry with each other. The others, including Paul Henreid and Claude Rains, are decent in here too. The score is pretty memorable but what I love most about this film is that each character seems to be well in the end because throughout the film, they all seem to be miserable people that have gone separate ways. These are good people and it's good for us, the audience, to know they aren't angry in the end because they each deserve their happiness.<br/><br/>The film is also shot in black and white, even though the use of color was an option for the filmmakers. Sometimes, certain films are better to be told in black and white, while others are better told in color. No doubt, Casablanca works well being in black and white, although there is a colored version out there. The scenes are heightened with the use of shadows and key things being pointed out are the advantages of this filter.<br/><br/>Overall, although I may find Casablanca to be overrated, I enjoyed it. I liked the love story and I was really satisfied in the end. If you have yet to see this film, see it. Although it may not be as good as its reputation holds, it's still a pretty great romance/film noir for any movie lovers to enjoy."

I just didn't find it as good as a lot of other people would think. The acting was great, as Humphrey Bogart always is. The story was also very interesting. I liked the twist at the end. So simple, yet so complex. Thats kind of what the whole movie is. Very simple, but yet at the same time somewhat complex. And i think what makes it complex is Bogart's character.

","`Casablanca' is a very well known movie by people of all ages.   A lot of whom enjoy the movie quite a bit and some who maybe don't enjoy it as much. This reviewer liked the movie for the most part.  It has an interesting plot, but one that mainly people of an older age would understand.  It has romance (and that's always a good thing) and it may even teach it's viewers a little something about history that they might not already know.  One of the only problems with the movie is that it's slow moving.  It's a lot of talk and no action.  Movies don't have to be all about blowing things up and killing people to be good, but `Casablanca' involved maybe a little bit too much talking, at least at one time.  At one point in the movie one of the main characters was talking for so long that this reviewer found herself starting to drift off.  Movies should grab the audience's attention and keep it.  `Casablanca' is a good movie, just one that could maybe be improved a little by picking up its pace.<br/><br/>All of the acting was very good.  Most of it was rather believable and didn't come across as too cheesy.  At the times when an actor/actress was supposed to be making a really long speech, they did so very well with a lot of the right emotion needed to convey what they were saying.  Rick, played by Humphrey Bogart, is supposed to be a bad boy who deep down inside has a heart.  Bogart did a very good job of portraying this.  Throughout the film Rick just seems to be cool and self-confident.  It's like he's what every boy wants to be, especially since the ladies like him.  All of the acting done in `Casablanca' only helped to make the movie what it is today, a timeless classic.<br/><br/>A big portion of the film is set in Rick's American Café, which is just about the only American thing in Casablanca.  Because of this almost all of the music is a piano playing in the background or someone singing.  There is music that has been added in, but a lot of it is music coming straight from something in the movie.  The whole idea of doing that gives the viewer more of a feel like they're there with the people on screen and not just watching them.  It should be used in more movies these days.<br/><br/>`Casablanca' came out in the 40's and, of course, the special effects back then weren't as good as they are now.  There was one scene in particular where the movie was really lacking in this area.  Ilsa, played by Ingrid Berdmen, and Rick (Bogart) are driving in a car together only they're not really driving.  There is a fake background behind them and it seems like they're just jumping up and down in their seats and smiling.  This whole thing is in other old movies too.  It just shows how far Hollywood has come with their special effects.<br/><br/>`Casablanca' is a good movie that could be improved a little.  There are a lot of movies out there that this reviewer would love to own and `Casablanca' just isn't one of them.  Yes, it is a classic and a great movie, but it's just not the type of movie that this reviewer enjoys."

","Yes, it is classy and a classic but personally, though I adore World War II movies, Casablanca is simply not my favorite. I love both the stars, the unique and immortal Humphrey Bogart, also the perennially wonderful and sympathetic Ingrid Bergman. And they have tremendous chemistry together here. That's the problem, there's just not enough of the love story and too much indecipherable wartime intrigue that I could never really quite fathom.<br/><br/>The plot revolves around a cynical, enigmatic American expatriate, Rick Blaine (Bogart) who runs a nightclub in Nazi occupied Casablanca. An old love, Ilsa (Bergman) arrives there with her husband, Victor Laszlo (leader of the European Resistance). Rick holds some bitterness toward Ilsa as she ran out on him years earlier in Paris. Meanwhile, there is assorted intrigue regarding some vital letters of transit that Rick has in his possession. He has the chance to turn his love's husband, Laszlo, over to the SS and be free to leave Casablanca with Ilsa. The question is...will he?<br/><br/>As I mentioned, the intrigue befuddled (and bored) me. For me, this old black and white wartime classic is all about three things, the amazing song ""As Time Goes By"", the memorable and famous closing scene (which I won't give away) and the following...<br/><br/>Much of the interaction between the characters occurs at Rick's nightclub, the Cafe Americain (the setting around which the film sort of revolves). There is one unforgettable scene there in which some drunken Nazi soldiers are singing the German national anthem. Resistance leader Laszlo orders the playing of the forbidden Marseillaise, the band starts up (with Rick's permission), Laszlo bursts into the French anthem, and the other club patrons gradually chime in, drowning out the Germans. It's fabulous! You can't help but cheer.<br/><br/>It's a famous old classic which I really should watch again. Maybe now that I'm older (and smarter?), I can ferret out all that intrigue!"

It was interesting to learn about all the different film techniques used throughout the movie. The girl who played Ilsa Lundt was quite a bad actress in this movie in my opinion. As a history student also, it was very interesting to see through the eyes of people living during this period of time, the use of lighting and camera angles is dominant in this film.

So say u watch a movie when you are s teenager and you live it, but then watch the same movie in your 40s and think the movie is horrible, most likely the movie is horrible you just didn't know any better when you were a teenager.<br/><br/>sorry but Casablanca is slow, boring and the dialogue is terrible. Now maybe the problem with most the older movies is the didn't have a lot of money put Into production, so every movie is like watching a play on the big screen. They relied heavily on dialogue, charcter development and good acting. Casablanca fails on all of these."

Besides the predictability, the plot was boring, the acting was average, there is no character development so you don't get attached to any of them. I know this was a propaganda movie and this actually sell's well the ideia of patriotism and victory against Germany, but the fact that this was for propaganda purposes should say a lot about this, the movie was rushed and the expectations were low but by some miracle everyone came to think that this is a masterpiece.
To me this is an american (propaganda) popcorn movie and nothing more then that. It's also one of the most quoted movies but I found a lot of the dialogues to be boring and unnecessary to the story development.<br/><br/>It was well made but it wasn't a cinematography masterpiece if you ask me, in the first minutes we have a scene where a guy gets shot and then there's no blood no bullet wound no nothing he just drops himself awfully on the floor and when the police go to him he has nothing but a little bit of blood in his mouth... now I know it was 1942 but they could've done it better.

"Horst_In_Translation","6","0","3","8 March 2020"," A pretty decent film that gets better towards the end, but hardly a classic
","""Casablanca"" is an American black-and-white film from 1942, so this one is already almost 80 years old and it was directed by Michael Curtiz. He won an Oscar for his effort there and the movie also took home the big prize, namely Best Picture. Another win was for the screenplay and three writers received a trophy there, even if we have a total of 7 writers listed here on imdb because this movie is based on a play. The actors and a few other nominees managed ""only"" nominations, but no wins. The year was 1942 like I already said, so of course World War II was a huge issue and this was a truly contemporarily relevant movie. Maybe this is why many mistook it for a great movie. It is not bad by any definition, but it is also certainly not the classic many people say it is. The subject here is also fairly unusual for a war movie and I cannot really remember any other film that focused primarily on the issue of people getting visas in order to be able to leave Europe/Africa and get to the United States where war hadn't arrived yet. Maybe this uniqueness in terms of subject is another reason why many people like it. We don't get military action or Holocaust stories (obviously because the entire mess was not known at that point yet) here, but something else. As for the cast: The lead actor here was Humphrey Bogart. He was okay overall, but not good enough for an Oscar nomination I'd say. I am glad Ingrid Bergman did not get any because she really was mostly forgettable here and honestly her scenes with Bogart were not the best the film had to offer, but maybe the worst, so it is really bizarre how some talk about this being the biggest romance story ever. If it really was this big, she would not have left him behind (twice!) and he would not agree that it is the right thing to do towards the end. The only solid moment there was when he said that now they have Paris again because he knows her real motivation for letting him go. Actually, I like the idea of this motivation in the sense of a greater cause, even if it is of course debatable if it makes sense that the two split up although they have major feelings for each other, which clearly she does not have for the Hungarian fella. There were at least two occasions when he says he loves her, but she does not say the same back. As for the cast, the second Oscar nomination went to Claude Rains, one of the most influential supporting actors of his time. He was okay too I'd say, but again not good enough for an Oscar nomination. I guess many mistook his surprising twist at the end (when he helps Bogart's character after seeming more like an antagonist all the way before that) for a great performance. But surprising does not equal sublime. His nomination was probably more about the writing than really about the portrayal. And of course that he was a good guy eventually. I must also say something about him becoming good did not make sense entirely. I can see why he was not too angry at Bogart's character for the fact that he let him not have the Bulgarian girl (by the way how did he even know the roulette numbers?), but he says earlier that they have not decided yet if a prisoner committed suicide or was killed while trying to flee (implying murder), which shows that he is definitely one of the bad guys, even if he is not German. The one who is German here is actor Conrad Veidt and his character was pretty much the main antagonist, even if he did not have too much screen time. Really sad how Veidt died shortly after this film was made at a relatively young age. He could have head a great career in Hollywood ahead of him. I think he was sublimely talented. Another (somewhat) German actor here was Peter Lorre. Many people immediately think of ""M"" when they hear his name, but they do not remember he was in here too and he plays a victim once again. I think his character is a Spaniard? With the black hair it kinda works. Luckily he lives on for a while afterwards. The supporting players are all pretty good here, for example also Sydney Greenstreet, who was nominated for an Oscar too the year this came out, so a fairly impressive cast for sure. It surprises me that Rains is the one we are supposed to believe stood out.<br/><br/>Well, I would not include Lebeau there. She was featured early on only, really early on, to basically show us how all the women love Bogart's character despite (or because of) his shenanigans, but she added nothing. And I already said that I did not like Bergman one bit here either, so this is not a film at all that shows us great character writing for females back then. Also kinda telling when we see how Bogart's character acts towards women and I am the last person who would say something like that if it wasn't entirely true. Snowflakes must melt. Anyway, what else can I say about this one here? I personally felt that it needed a little while to get going and draw me in with the action. I still was not too big on the overall plot, but preferred individual scenes and moments instead, even if some of these scenes also did not make a huge amount of sense. The best example is the shooting at the end. Are we really supposed to believe absolutely nobody saw who pulled the trigger? Oh well, still a good scene, one of the better. There are many other scenes. I liked the Ugarte/Lorre moments. The flashback scenes in Paris were fine too. The two epic quotes of course (""We'll always have Paris."" and the recurring ""Here's looking at you, kid."", which did not become remotely memorable before the second mention). The scenes with the Black musician were fine as well, even if I must say I am not too amazed by how they treated him, especially Bogart's character. Here and there, we also get an ounce of comedy in this otherwise pretty serious movie and that stems from a pickpocket doing his job. Then there is of course the lengthy sequence with the Bulgarian girl and her lover that was supposed to show us what a good guy Bogart's character really is. Annina is her name. And by the way, she is already living evidence of how the quote that there was never a more beautiful woman than Bergman's character coming to Casablanca is complete nonsense. Oh yeah, another scene I really adored was the big spectacular music scene. This clash between German traditional music and the French anthem was one of the most powerful moments of the movie and showed the resistance against the Nazis in a pretty interesting fashion. Speaking of the music, the film's soundtrack was also nominated for an Oscar and the one who came up with it (Max Steiner) won several Oscars in his career, already had 2 by then and many many more nominations and you can see from the title he was also German (well, Austrian to be exact), but it shows how many German-speaking people were a part of this film, from both cast and crew, and of course all of them are people who had turned their back on Hitler by then. Okay, I guess this should be all then. I enjoyed the watch overall after the film gained pace and the first rather weak 30 minutes were over. So I certainly recommend checking it out and I give it a thumbs-up. You can surely have a pretty decent time seeing this one. Just don't think you will be in for something truly extraordinary because otherwise your great expectations here could end up unfulfilled. Just enjoy it for what it is!"

","A 2nd-rate melodrama and promotion-film whose lasting power is only exceeded by Coca-Cola's famous sales slogan, 'the pause that refreshes (29).'<br/><br/>Highly-hyped since it premiered in November of 1942 (Hollywood), less than two months prior to the first-rate Allied powers conference held in Casablanca, Morocco in January of 1943 (""unconditional surrender"" decree), then in national release one day prior to the meeting's end (1.23.43). Now how's that for a go-getter public-relations department? Yet, it is the perfect Classic for the new millennium as its greatness lies not in its story or any real sentiment but its still sizable celebrity.<br/><br/>Not only is Blanca a bad romance, it's a bad war film, too. To think that Ilsa (Ingrid) would even consider leaving her husband, the tall, handsome, brave Czech Allied operative, Victor (Henreid), for the older, bow-tie wearing, bar-owner Rick (Bogart), hits the height of implausibility, though, Laszlo may run a bit short himself in the smarts department, leading an oddly-timed rendition of La Marseillaise in the Cafe, even as he tries to stay one step ahead of the Nazi thugs. But that Lund does flirt with infidelity in such circumstance makes a mockery of any claim at sentiment and romantic worth.<br/><br/>To the film's war image, that Blaine, supposedly a former a freedom-fighter (Spanish Civil War) and gun-runner (Ethiopia), has decided to sit out the Big One (WW2) is hard to figure. Just as hard to appreciate is Rick's chummy relationship with the local Vichy authority in Renault (Rains), a position which in any reality would've had the prefect putting countless Allies and innocents into the clutches of the SS (Veidt), but has now decided to risk it all for his Yankee pal on a spontaneous infusion of conscience? C'mon.<br/><br/>But more disappointing than the story and script (Renault: ""I'm shocked, shocked to find there's gambling going on in here!"") (oy), is that I admire so many of the artists involved in the cooking of this over-baked ham. A cavalcade of Classic greats in leads Bogart (The-Haves African-Queen), Bergman (Gaslight) & Henreid (Now-Voyager), characters Veidt (Dark-Journey), Rains (Invisible-Man LoA), Lorre (M), Qualen (Grapes), Greenstreet (Maltese-Falcon), Sakall (YDD Summertime), Dalio (La-Grande-Illusion), Dantine, Page, LeBeau, Steiner, Wallis produced and director Curtiz who developed so many stars in films like Noahs-Ark The-Adventures-Of-Robin-Hood Mildred-Pierce Yankee-Doodle-Dandy The-Breaking-Point Trouble-Along-the-Way, just to name a few. Under-utilization of great talent was never so apparent.<br/><br/>The clincher: Had Woody Allen not revived interest in the film on Play-It-Again-Sam (72), it may've settled into a more fitting state. According to TCM host Robert Osborne, two of its three leads in Henreid and Bergman, both who'd out-lived co-star Bogart (d.57) and were afforded time for reflection, had expressed ""surprise"" at the great acclaim that continued to heap upon the picture. Like Meatloaf sang, ""two outta' three ain't bad,"" but this movie surely is .. bad, haughty AFI rank notwithstanding (2/4)."

"CubsandCulture","7","0","1","7 October 2018"," Mostly very good but the romance robs the intrigue...
","While the love story between Rick/Ilsa is rather well done I feel that the amount of space it takes up is too much. Specifically there are two scenes early on that allow Rick to get the letters of travel and Victor to know of their location. Both scenes have to hang a lantern on the character motivations to make them believable. Unfortunately in retrospect it is rather obvious what the screenwriters ended up doing to get the plot to work. It makes the entire film feel a bit off.<br/><br/>Similarly, while the love story is engaging, and this might be a consequence of the film's influence, it is no where near as engaging as the political intrigue. The film is at its best when the political context is at the forefront, such as the dueling national songs scenes. I was far more interested in how Rick and Renault navigate the German demands. The spy stuff is just better polished.<br/><br/>It could be because I think Renault is easily the best part of this film. Rains is a delightfully self-aware cynic and there is a dark joy to that character. I wish the screenplay spent more time on him. <br/><br/>Nonetheless this is a fine film and a classic of Hollywood."

That is achieved through various filming techniques, such as characters being different heights to display their inferiority/superiority in a relationship, various clever angle uses, well written dialog and of course, great acting.<br/><br/>The mood, i think, is set quite well, you can feel like you are in this Rick's saloon, there is really a lot of attention given to detail to make it a believable place.<br/><br/>There wasn't, at least for me, any confusion as to what exactly is going on on the screen, which sometimes happens for me with some of these older movies, so that's a plus.<br/><br/>At first, as I was watching the movie, I thought that the relationship between Rick and the girl didn't have much going for it, but when the film was over, I understood everything, where Rick stood, where the girl stood and where the other guy stood.

"weezeralfalfa","7","0","1","11 March 2017"," An American in wartime Morocco: pretty good, but too many contrivances
","I've seen this film, in part or whole, a number of times over the years. Used to be I thought it was pretty boring, until the climax at the end. Now that I analyzed it in some depth,I appreciate the whole film more, despite various major contrivances. I'm still not convinced that Humphrey Bogart was the right actor to play the main character: American, Rick. He was good in the climactic sequence, but often rather boring before that. I'm not sure how much was due to the script and how much was due to Bogie's basic personality. I suspect some of both. <br/><br/>The plot is divided into 2 parts, both of which are relevant throughout most of the film to the end. There's the question of how Czech resistance fighter Victor Laszio(Paul Henreid) was going to get out of French Morocco, needing a letter of transit to do so. He was considered very dangerous by the Germans. Hence, they sent a patrol, headed by Major Strasser, to Casablanca, where they guessed he would end up, to make sure he didn't leave for a safe haven(the USA). Secondly, the present and future status of the past love affair between Rick and Scandinavian Ilsa(Ingrid Bergman), wife of Laszio, needs to be worked out. Rick and Ilsa had met in Paris, after it was reported that Laszio had been killed by the Germans. When the Germans were about to take over Paris, it was decided they needed to leave France. But, mysteriously, Ilsa didn't show up at the train station where she was supposed to meet Rick. He went south by himself, on to Morocco. Now, she showed up in his café with Laszio. Rick didn't find out until later that they were married before she met Rick, and she only learned that he was alive the day she was supposed to go with Rick. She explained to Rick that she didn't tell him she had been married because it was a secret to help protect her from harm by the Germans. This eased his mind somewhat. This type of love triangle is always difficult to work out, especially if the woman has married her new love: not a factor here. The screenplay keeps the audience guessing which man Ilsa will end up with, whether she makes the choice or it's made for her(it is). I think Ingrid was an excellent choice for Ilsa, having grown up in Scandinavia, her English speech was so European, and she was a lovely and good actress. The occasional close-ups of the faces, especially Ingrid's, helps to define their emotional state.<br/><br/>The all important travel document which we are bothered with from the beginning to the very end was an invention of the script writer, having no historical relevance. In the first and last parts of the film, this document is called a letter of transit, whereas in the middle portion, it's called an exit visa. I'm assuming these are the same thing, but it unnecessarily confuses the audience(at least me).<br/><br/>We have a fairly interesting group of secondary characters: not too many, and of various nationalities and allegiances relating to the war. Renault(Claude Rains), the French chief of police, says he doesn't have strong feelings about the Vichy vs. free French choice. He will bend with the prevailing wind. Rick similarly claims neutrality. But, like the US, still officially neutral, there are several indications that he's not as neutral as he claims.<br/><br/>Clearly, Rick is very depressed about something through most of the film. His café seems to be thriving, so what is it? Partly, the uncertainty of the war, I believe. Also, the void in his romantic life after Ilsa disappeared. He hasn't found an adequate replacement, taking up with a floozy in the meanwhile, and uncertain about what Ilsa wants for the future. When Ilsa pulls a gun on him to hand over the letters of transit he inherited, he remarks ""Go ahead and shoot, you'll be during me a favor"". He's also cynical about the war, and the world in general. When Laszio answers ""If we stop fighting, the world will die"", Rick responds. ""What of it. That will put it out of its misery"". With his depression and cynicism dominating his personality, he's a hard man for audiences to like. That's a big problem with this film. But as Renault observes, despite his cynicism and depression, occasionally, he's a sentimentalist. This is shown when he orders the roulette wheel to be 'fixed' so that it comes up the number for a young Bulgarian refugee so that he will have the money to buy a letter of transit, so he and his wife can go to the US. Similarly, in finally providing letters of transit for Laszio and Ilsa, and giving up claim on Ilsa, he demonstrates compassion. <br/><br/>""Casablanca"" is not only a love story and wartime drama, it can be considered a musical! Of course, the most remembered song is ""As Time Goes By"". I was surprised to learn this song had been kicking around for a decade before. Of course, its inclusion in this film much increased its visibility. Another prominent song is ""Knock on Wood"": the only song specifically composed for this film. Then, there's the famous competition between the Germans, singing a German song, and the much more numerous other patrons of Rick's cafe, drowning them out with ""La Marseillaise"". Many others were played at least a little, mostly by Dooley Wilson, as listed under 'Soundtracks' at this site."
"theocharous_an","8","0","1","1 March 2017"," A timeless classic
","Yes, I've finally watched Casablanca and I felt like I reached another milestone. Saying that the film is famous is just an understatement. Casablanca is undoubtedly one of the most loved, influential and timeless pictures in the history of cinema. Yes, even 75 years later, this classic continues to mesmerize the audiences with its captivating story and compelling characters.<br/><br/>Filmed and set during WWII, Casablanca focuses on Rick Blaine (Humphrey Bogart), an American expatriate who owns a club in the city of Casablanca, then in French Morocco. He is introduced as a powerful, rich and cynical man who only cares about his own good. Everything changes though when Ilsa Lund (Ingrid Bergman) walks into his club. Rick's past, as well as his well-hidden emotional nature, start to unfold and the events that follow lead him to a great dilemma.<br/><br/>Do you know anyone, at least half-interested in cinema who has never heard of Casablanca? Probably not. Now, there is reason why a film so old is still famous today and frequently appears in ""top 10 films of all time"" lists. So what distinguishes Casablanca from its contemporaries? I would say its story. The characters seem to have been taken out of an ancient Greek tragedy as they find themselves caught between love, duty and honour. The plot and pace are excellent, especially the way the timeline unfolds raising questions and then revealing the answers one at a time while the action is building and the climax is drawing closer. A love triangle or a love story with sad (or even bittersweet) ending wasn't something you saw much in films back then. Casablanca was bold, affecting and included characters much more realistic and relatable than the conventional of Hollywood's golden age.<br/><br/>Of course one could by no means ignore the superb acting. Humphrey Bogart is outstanding as the overwhelming Rick Blaine, indifferent on the outside, but a romantic sentimentalist on the other. Ingrid Bergman also shines in what is probably her most famous performance. She did a remarkably good job considering that she was still learning English. The supporting cast is solid, nothing less expected from actors like Paul Henreid, Claude Rains and Peter Lorre. The surprising fact is that nobody had any great expectations about the film. The story is an adaptation of a not so successful play, the production was rushed and used limited budget due to the war and both Bogart and Bergman tried to get out of the film at some point. Well, they couldn't be more wrong. Surprisingly, everything worked perfectly for Casablanca and the result continues to inspire actors and film makers to this day.<br/><br/>More reviews on https://reflectingoncinemablog.wordpress.com/"

","Well, maybe it's not the expected way to talk about this movie but at last, it's objective and it's not the one-sided opinion about classic, cult, magic. In addition, it's great way to analyze movies evolution : so in the two movies, we have a frontier neutral town before liberty, bad guys and rebels, a saloon-keeper who doesn't take side, a police officer who is not very clean, a fat guy managing black market, two tickets for a plane and for sure an old love getting hot again ! With that, i would say that the most recent movie shows more but as it's silly contents (nakedness, violence), the effect to the movie is useless. Here, we just have the characters speaking and interacting in a civilized way, so the old movie is thousand more thrilling because it's only psychological ! So those old movies in black and white and using out-of-date technology are not finally boring but are rather more punchy than the actual ones because they cut to the essential : humans feelings and relationships ! Anyway, this old one has indeed a fabulous cast : as said by Lynch, it's true that Isabella looks like her mother, Bogart shows than less is more but for me, the magic lies with the black and white : it's so full, so complementary in costumes, the white saloon, the black night, the shadows that it was like seeing a color movie ! For sure as a french, i really appreciated when our hymn mutes Nazis songs and regarding to the date of production, i keep in mind the line « Even Nazi can't kill so fast », which was proved totally worst a few months later !!"

","""Casablanca"" is a truly classic American picture. Michael Curtiz takes us to an important time in history at the time during WW II where Rick Blaine, who owns a nightclub in Casablanca, Morocco, discovers his old flame Ilsa is in town with her husband, Victor Laszlo. Laszlo is a resistance leader from Czechoslovakia, and with Germans on his tail, Ilsa knows Rick can help them get out of the country. This historical icon with stars Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman is a testament of love and international affairs. Few classics can be so engaging and historically vivid like ""Casablanca."" This film is still talked about to this day not only due to the historical Hollywood icons that lead the film, but for its portrayal of important Americans in a foreign land who come across dangerous obstacles."

","OK, I admit it, I'm a sucker for all things Bogart. No, not all his movies stand out as masterpieces but among the actors who epitomize the Golden Age of Cinema, Bogart is at or near the top. That having been said, Casablanca stands apart. The story perfectly captures the complications and confusing ideals of the time. There are some characters who are clearly on the wrong side of good vs evil but so many of them (just like in life) are caught somewhere in the middle. Knowing what is right, and, doing what is right, becomes complicated. Casablanca is riveting cinema and stands as one of the top movies of all time. As with so many Golden Age movies, the acting is incredible and the pace is spot on. If you haven't seen this wartime classic, it's a must."

","Casablanca was filmed and released before the end of World War II, making it an interesting time capsule. A look at history, at time period where everything hung on balance, where everything was uncertain. United States had already joined the war effort by this point, but there were still years of war ahead before victory could be claimed.<br/><br/>And as it is, it really works. World War II provides the background, the drive behind almost all of the characters, but it's not really on the foreground. It's there, certainly, but the story is more about the characters than it is about the war. And I find that to be the right decision. These characters are driven to their breaking point by the war, but it's much more interesting for us to see what they do in that breaking point than it is for us to understand exactly what that point is.<br/><br/>And the characters are really good. Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman are both phenomenal actors, legends of their field, and it really shows here. Bogart especially steals the whole show, and it's no wonder that the whole film is pretty much one iconic quote after another. The lines and deliveries are just that good.<br/><br/>Casablanca is one of those films where everything just works. The story, the dialogue, the characters, the style, the pacing, the whole nine yards. One of the classics for a reason and definitely a must see film for all fans of the moving pictures."

He's the kind of guy that you'd follow orders from regardless what they were, he has that kind of influence on the others in the movie.<br/><br/>But our Rick also has a soft spot and this is for Ilsa Lund, his former lover, and when they meet again he'll do everything to help her and her husband Victor Laszlo from escaping Casablanca and going to Lisbon, like so many others would like to.<br/><br/>Seeing an old black and white movie really made me want to watch more of this genre and I'll surely will.

","This film caught the nation's attention mid war, it showed Rick, the isolationist, and the woman that would come back into his life, Elsa, that would be the strong enough to prompt him to reconsider his decision and stance on the war. As an isolationist, he refused to get involved, even in the beginning when someone he was familiar with got arrested in his establishment, right in front of him. Even as the man was gripping Rick's shirt pleading for his assistance, Rick remained nonchalant about the whole matter. And when someone else he was familiar and friendly with saw his lack of involvement and said, ""When they come to get me Rick I hope you'll be more of a help"", to which Rick calmly and nonchalantly says, ""I stick my neck out for nobody"", walks away, and goes back to work. But when a blast from the past comes back into his life, Rick is flooded with emotion. First with a piano piece Elsa asks the piano player to play, has Rick storming out of a back room heatedly saying ""I thought I told you to never play that song"". At which point the player points to Elsa, and from then, a switch is flipped within Rick. The use of heavy shadow or lack of it tells the story almost as much as the words of this timely significant film does. The crime for which Rick was pleaded to aid in exempting the man from political consequence, the crime is to be committed by someone very, very close to Rick's heart. This film follows the change (or lack of) in Rick's mind through use of flashback and the course of action he takes in the film to get to the ultimate end of this film in which the ever changing analytical side of Rick becomes set, in which his motives are brought to light, and is 100% decisive in his ultimate decisions. This film was so extremely culturally significant as there were many Rick's in the world, many Americans in the USA and elsewhere making the decision to distance themselves and be thoroughly uninvolved in the events of war; not even wanting to hear about it and those who were very patriotic, fighting and aiding the war effort. This movie explores that in a very realistic way, and on the surface, a very straightforward way, but more in depth, had an all too common complexity that made it very relatable to its audience."

","It's not hard to figure out why 'Casablanca' is such a classic. Its characters, themes, plot development and music will speak to anyone with a heart. But I'd also understand it if some people find it somewhat overrated. Its characters, themes, plot development and music also may feel a little contrived and over the top, especially nowadays. Personally, I'm somewhere in the middle, with a tendency to sympathize more and more as the story progresses.<br/><br/>The opening of the film is pretty fast. A lot of things have happened before the main characters are even introduced. That's not really a bad thing. The flashback scenes in Paris are not all too convincing, though, in terms of building up a truly captivating, romantic atmosphere. There's some sweet talk, some cuddling, some kissing, some happy (studio) driving and... then there are the Germans. Again, things go pretty fast, and here it's not really helping.<br/><br/>The last half hour of the film is visually much more appealing to me than what preceded it (with more of a film noir feel to it - which must be intentional, to emphasize how Rick gets more and more involved with everything and has a better sense of what is what in more than one way). Also, in the first hour, there are simply too many characters and there is too much talking going on for my taste, I suppose.<br/><br/>It's still a thoroughly enjoyable classic, even it is a minor one in my modest little book. A good 7 out of 10."

On my second time watching the film, I picked up many subtly elements that truly improved the overall feel of the film that I did not see when I watched the film many years ago. The dialog that the characters use is also very realistic to the time period so is not necessarily easily understood by viewers from this century. The characters also speak very fast and can be quite often hard to understand. Despite these few caveats, Casablanca ultimately does not disappoint.

The film's lead (Humphrey Bogart) does an incredible job of playing a kind of mysterious, hard to crack his shell, kind of protagonist. However, I feel the films hype may have lessened the impact of it for me. I liked it and enjoyed myself overall, however, I found myself bored at times as it was mostly the same location.

","Casablanca was one of the most beautifully filmed and acted and deserves to be considered one of the best movies of its era. The use of light in this film in showing the seriousness of the characters was very prevalent. It showed the uncertainty of the characters. As the story progresses we learn more and more about the characters pasts and after a while you start to think you know a character but, their motivations and intentions turn out to be different then originally thought. I enjoyed that aspect because it kept me on my toes. The acting was very very well done especially by Humphrey Bogart, his take on Rick Blaine was seemingly tough and hard to crack but as the movie continues we see his more emotional side and who he is as a person. Overall the film was very beautiful in its camera-work, acting, lighting, and even the sets and costumes.

The use of shadow and what seemed like dim lighting really added to the tension and drama of the plot. I also appreciated the use of flashback in the film which was not common at the time. Everything about this movie was great for capturing the attention of the audience.

","Michael Curtiz's ""Casablanca"" was, to me and to many people in the world, one of the greatest movies ever created. What made the movie so amazing in my eyes had to be the story, dialogue, and cinematography throughout the film. The story was a relatable one, disenchanted lovers who meet again one day but seemingly cannot be together. The movie is magnificent at showcasing the highly interesting story of Rick, Ilsa, and all the dynamic characters they continue to meet along the way. Every main and supporting character in the movie was interesting and had depth beyond the surface. The story wasn't predictable and it kept me engaged throughout. The dialogue is one of my favorite aspects of Casablanca. Famous quotes such as ""Of all the gin joints, in all the towns, in all the worlds, she walks into mine,"" sum up the characters' feelings, emotions, thoughts, and the type of person they are all through their dialogue. The cinematography is also a key to success for Casablanca. The attention to detail with shadows and soft lights creates beautiful scenes that convey tenderness in characters such as Ilsa or sadness in Rick. The movie, overall, is a piece of art that has and will continue to stand the test of time in cinema, and rightfully so."

While nothing crazy and whacked out happens in this film. It stays true to its strengths and delivers a solid film.

It's just one of those things you hear a lot about throughout your life, but don't really get where people are coming from until you see it for yourself. Casablanca has something for everyone: action, drama, romance, etc. The movie itself is timeless. Rick is a strong, confident character and handles certain situations rather effortlessly. It's interesting to watch how everyone gravitates towards the character with a strong sense of independence. The characters are what really make the film.

This movie was loved by everyone who watched it. It was released at the right time in history to catch the eye of every one.

In a time of despair for the nation, this movie was made to show hope for the loyal citizens. This movie showed that there was a light at the end of the dark tunnel that people were living in. The love story definitely adds to the effect and serves as a distraction from the overall message. The use of light in this movie adds to the way it is perceived. In many of the dramatic scenes, the entire room is dark except for a light that shines perfectly on the face of the actor in frame.

","Nearly every aspect of Casablanca is striking and impressive. From the sound design to the lighting to the performances, the film doesn't even give you time to stop and process the imagery, witticisms, or technical tricks. This is not to say that's a bad thing. Casablanca, as a result, has great rewatch value.<br/><br/>That's not to say that the film has too fast a pace, either. It moves a long logically, just packs so much into each scene. It respects its audience and their ability to ""understand,"" or at least think about what they have seen. Personally, this makes a film that much more enjoyable for me. I think its cultural significance and peoples' timeless care for Casablanca speak to that as well.<br/><br/>The chiaroscuro in Casablanca is a constant source of awe. The lights and shadows work off each other in ways that are menacing, playful, and even romantic. The tone-setting and story-telling done with the lighting alone could (and probably has) be the subject of a long, thoughtful paper.<br/><br/>The performances, too, are so impressive in their subtext. It isn't typical to see such nuanced emotional storytelling layered in with the more blatant acting we're used to seeing. The backstory between Rick (Humphrey Bogart), Ilsa (Ingrid Bergman), and Sam (Dooley Wilson), is told (in addition to the flashbacks) in reactions and facial expressions (such as Rick's reaction to the song Sam is asked to play by Ilsa, or the scene where Ilsa confesses her love to Rick after holding him at gunpoint for passports), rather than ham-fisted ""remember when we all met?""

"eabakkum","7","0","2","19 November 2015"," A review should stick to the facts, and bar emotions
","I inherited the DVD Casablanca from my father. My parents belonged to the war generation and were liberated from the German occupation by the American army. Consequently in the fifties and sixties they received every American novelty with awe. American films had a cult status, and certainly Humphrey Bogart, and definitely the war film Casablanca. Bogard has a good name. He said rightly: ""You are not a star until they can spell your name in Karachi"". Dave Chasen said of him:""Bogey is a hell of a nice guy until 11.30 p.m. After that he thinks he is Bogart"". In Cacablanca an American hero turns out to be a veritable chevalier as well. So these are my tender emotions, when I watch the film. However, all generalizations are false. A review should stick to the facts, and bar emotions. And in the light of day the script of Casablanca looks a little shaky. The town is portrayed as the center of human trafficking, which is evidently a dirty business. Therefore it seems slightly unlikely that the local bar owner would have a heart of gold, like Bogart. Joke to make this review even better: a penguin walks into a bar, and asks the bartender: ""Have you seen my brother?"" The bartender replies: ""I don't know. What does he look like?"" In addition the film characters of Bogart and Bergman are somewhat unpleasant. Bogart keeps reproaching Bergman how she has hurt his feelings. A normal person would be glad to have gotten rid of her. Never buy a car you can't push. And Bergman is unable to chose between her two lovers. In the end she leaves the decision to Bogart, which is either preposterous or cunningly clever. Sometimes the best helping hand you can give is a good, firm push. A normal person would assume, that apparently her two lovers are both inadequate. Fortunately, even when a film has an unconvincing narrative, it can still be saved by the quality of the separate scenes. In this respect Casablanca has definitely some excellent moments to offer. A face can say so many things. Especially the mouth part. Therefore it still deserves a positive recommendation. Play it again. Don't forget to leave comments. I love it."

It may be a little overly dramatic, but it's a drama so I expect it to be that way. I love the part where Humphrey and the French Police officer are watching Ingrid and her husband walk away into the fog on the airport runway. The cinematography is great also. A lot of shots were very unique but the most spectacular thing about this film is the use of it's dramatic lighting. It's used constantly through out the film. 3-Point, Back light, Key light, and Fill light! Always, nearly every shot seemed to have some sort of lighting factor in it. The lighting also persuaded the mood of the film immensely to me. When it was dark it seem mysterious and when it was normal light it just seemed neutral. I didn't find anything in this film to be a bit boring and I was consistently following the story."

","I've heard only good things about Casablanca and it is easy to see why. Already have been told major things to pay attention to, already have been told memorable parts of the film such as the French National Anthem being played, allowed me to appreciate the film in a more personal way. The love story between Rick and Ilsa was loving, sad, surprising and memorable all wrapped into a nice little bundle. There are indeed some great moments such as the piano playing, the incredible lighting techniques, and even the message of the war time world. Rick, the owner of a bar in Morocco and the main man in the film, is reunited with a former love, Ilsa. You can sense the tension between the two because of Ilsa's new man, and the hurt Rick feels from their days spent together in Paris (which is expressed through his alcohol consumption and late nights after hours at the bar). Though bitter, he still manages to get her, and her boyfriend, to America to ensure their safety from the dangerous Morocco. The story and plot are fantastic, and the wartime message to beat the Nazi's is extremely powerful, and the new lighting/shadows techniques was second-to-none for its time. A watch I recommend for every movie lover."

","This movie was really good. The whole look of the film was awesome. The movies shot in black and white and with the lighting in the movie, it gives an awesome looking image. When I first saw this movie i thought it was going to be just a love story and i wasn't to interested but it ended up being way more interesting. The characters i thought were really good as well. The movie stars Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman and was shot in (1942) and is directed by Michael Curtis. Its its 102 minutes long and is rated Pg. I highly recommend this film. Real good movie. The way the film looks is really cool, it doesn't look like other black and white movies either. Its different."

","This film is very original and well done. The characters did a great job and the story was excellent. Casablanca is one of a kind and being such an old film it still brings in so many memories. The saying ""Play it again Sam"" is still used in this day and age. This film unleashes thrilling romance, humor, and a bit of suspense. At a time when the United States entered the second world war this film really hits the spot in the audiences minds filled with excitement and joy. Director Michael Curtiz really did a great job with the use of artistic and dramatic aspects as well as playing a key role in the use of visualization. Casablanca would be highly recommended to watch."

","Not truly a fan of Love stories like these, very dramatic and for me that can get kind of annoying after a while, personally I felt like it dragged on for a little to long. Though I can see why so many people fell for i, trust me if I would have been more into romantic stories I would have fallen for this one and possibly even called a favorite, the story was really well written with a lovely twist at the end that would make any girl swoon.There was lovely use of Lighting, like really good, with showing both characters and their emotions by the darkness, the lightness, the different shapes the lights took on the characters, all of it was so well put together it definitely helped make the movie. The cinematography and setting also created the alluring romance of the movie. With the great bar scenes and busyness of the town, as well as the airplane scenes, it was all really well done."

","When a lot of people think of ""Casablanca"" they think mostly of the romantic nature of the film and focus all their attention on this, but this film was much more than just a great romance. The film has elements of action, suspense, and is a comedic goldmine with plenty of iconic quotes and memorable scenes. All of the acting was excellent in this movie with special recognition going to Humphrey Bogart as Rick and Claude Rains as Captain Renault, who both made up the two most dynamic characters in the film and really made it a winner. In addition to the excellent characters and cast, the story was also very interesting and dynamic, and the ending was a pleasant surprise."

","Personally I thought this was one of the better movies that I have seen in years. The acting was incredible the characters seemed so perfectly cast in their role. Humphrey Bogart delivers his lines perfectly and smoothly. Speaking of that all of the dialogue spoken in this movie just seems as smooth as butter. The lighting throughout the whole movie was very expressive and this film to me had a perfect setting. The setting was away from the war but in it at the very same time. I went into this movie that I had never seen before with certain expectations of what it would be like. Different those expectations are but this film went above and beyond and delivered."
"billylarrick","10","0","1","15 September 2015"," The greatest movie ever made
","Casablanca is the pinnacle of what filmmaking can achieve and stands as a testament to the power of phenomenal acting and the power of a compelling story. A timeless classic, this movie stands above all others and should be watched again and again.<br/><br/>Characters<br/><br/>The brilliance of Casablanca begins and ends with Humphrey Bogart. Rick Blaine is the performance of a lifetime given by the world's most skilled actor. Here we see Bogart's incredible range on full display; he is the cutthroat and cynical saloon owner, the romantic in flashback, the jilted lover, and the heartbroken man who is torn between choosing the woman he loves and doing what he knows to be right. Bogart is entirely believable in this role, so much so that it's hard to imagine Bogey isn't the cynic with the heart of a sentimentalist that he portrays. When watching Casablanca and seeing the story of Rick's past romance with Ilsa unfold we feel his pain, we share his anger and his confusion as if it was our own, whether we are watching for the first time or the hundredth time. Rick is every man who has ever been in love, who has turned cynical after having his heart broken, and who will do anything—even sacrifice his own happiness —to ensure her happiness. To be able to connect with such a complex character is possible because of Bogart's genuine delivery. Bogart's role as Rick will stand the test of time as one of the most legendary performances in film history.<br/><br/>Along with Bogey, the support he receives from every other actor in this film is astounding. Ingrid Bergman is flawless as Ilsa Lund. Her cold demeanor towards Bogey throughout most of the film combined with the frustrated love of his character creates the perfect chemistry. Bergman holds her cards tight to her chest and keeps us guessing as to whether she will choose to rejoin Rick or escape with her husband Victor Laszlo and even more importantly, which man she loves more. <br/><br/>Rains portrayal of the French captain whose loyalty ""blows with the prevailing wind"" is brilliant in its own right and in no way overshadowed by Bogey and Bergman. Part of what makes Rain's performance so impressive is that he is able to add a level of comic relief to the film while still maintaining the seriousness of a captain of the police when the occasion calls for it. He is both the man who can shut down Rick's Café for gambling while collecting his winnings. <br/><br/>While Rick, Ilsa, and Rains are the primary focus of Casablanca, what puts this movie over the top is the depth of talent it receives from its secondary actors. There are strong performances all around from Sydney Greenstreet as the profit oriented businessman Senior Ferrari, Peter Lorre as the sleazy criminal Ugarte, and Sam as the warm-hearted and amenable pianist. These characters may not contribute on a large scale but their performances maintain the film's high quality of acting.<br/><br/>Dialogue: Along with acting, what separates this film from all others are its lines. Not just the half dozen that appear in the American Film Institute's most famous movie quotes, twice as many as any other film, but lines like ""You'll get along beautifully in America,"" ""There are vultures, vultures everywhere,"" or ""I stick my neck out for nobodyA wise foreign policy"" are what make this movie not only powerful but enjoyable to watch. It all starts with great acting but to be the best movie of all time you have to have a great script and Casablanca has the best.<br/><br/>Music: ""As time goes by"", ""Knock on wood"", and ""The Marseilles"" deliver a lot for just a few songs. The Marseilles scene is arguably the most emotional musical performance is cinema history, made especially powerful by the fact that many of the French citizens in the café were real-life emigrants during the war and shed real tears as they sang in the movie. While ""As Time Goes By"" may be the song most famously remembered for Sam to play again, it is ""The Marseilles"" that marks the turning point in the film. Showing the French citizens overpowering the Germans serves as a powerful symbol of the French resistance to the Nazis and was also written for an American audience that had just entered the war following Pearl Harbor only months earlier. The audience feels the genuine struggle of war-torn Europe instead of the artificial feel of propaganda that made some other films feel like a war time commercial and a cheesy ploy for enlistment. This scene is also of significant importance to the story because of what happens right before it. While it is Laszlo who tells the band to play the Marseilles, the band does not do so until Rick nods for them to go ahead. In this moment Rick does much more than tell the band to play, he breaks the last and most important of his precedents that he had maintained before Ilsa arrived: his neutrality. By nodding for the band to play, Rick knows that he is symbolically siding with the French and that the Germans will now view him as a threat to their mission to arrest Laszlo. It is in this moment that Rick makes the decision to help Laszlo and to give up Ilsa and his café. Scenes like this display the powerful acting at work in Casablanca and the beauty in the power that one look and a simple nod can have.<br/><br/>Casablanca is simply the greatest movie of all time. Citizen Kane and The Shawshank Redemption cannot hold a candle to this movie and with the current trend towards emphasizing CGI over acting, it is possible no film ever will. <br/><br/>Check out my full review at http://windreelandprintmoviereviews.blogspot.com/<br/><br/>Or just search Wind Reel And Print Movie Reviews"

","Before watching this movie, I have seen Casablanca mentioned as one of the greatest movies ever made. I had huge expectations for this movie and after watching it I can see why it is such a widely loved movie. Set in the backdrop of World War 2, the story revolves around Rick who is the owner of a gin joint in Casablanca. The dialogs are what truly make this movie memorable as a number of them have become fixtures of popular culture. The acting is marvelous and Humphrey Bogart is exceptional as a man with a broken heart who is a sentimentalist. Even though the movie is very old, the themes of love and heartbreak still resonate in the present day. I believe people can enjoy this masterpiece for centuries to come."

","Casablanca is a 1942 romantic drama directed by Michael Curtiz, but the strength of the film is that classification does not entirely do it justice. The story could also be called a war movie, even though there isn't any traditional war action and has a film noir feel at times.<br/><br/>The film stars Humphrey Bogart as Rick and Ingrid Bergman as Ilsa. There is some terrific dialog and many famous lines, such as when Rick toasts Ilsa saying ""Here's looking at you, kid"". Delivered perfectly of course.<br/><br/>The cinematography is excellent, and I thought the filming of the scenes inside the bar were very impressive. The lighting was very interesting, with some film noir style lighting at times. Bergman was often filmed with a very gauzy look, but it was subtle, in fact it was beautiful, but it didn't distract from the film. The music is perfection, and is the acting.<br/><br/>I need to see this again as I am sure I missed a lot as the story is a little complex and there is a lot going on on screen."
"cleigh115","10","0","1","11 May 2015"," One of the best!
","Time seems to date some movies badly, while it has worked greatly in favor of some movies, like Casablanca. It was made in the day when color was rare, yet, used black and white so well that it seems to be a great example of a movie that should have been filmed in black and white, even if doing such were to have cost more than color. Casablanca is a real classic. It's the sort of movie that feels like an experience and makes you glad you've seen it. It was all so excellent that I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to anyone who loves movies. When you see some of these scenes for yourself you immediately understand how they've had such a lasting influence to this day. For the leading characters, their relationship meant hope, which was exactly what was needed throughout the bleak time that was World War II. Every character leaves an indelible mark even though all it did in the movie was hit a few guitar strings or pick pocket at a restaurant. Every scene in the movie is a study in itself. Casablanca without doubt makes its way in my all time top 5 list!"
"larkinadrienne","10","0","1","4 May 2015"," Favorite Of All Time
","I am a 22 year old female, and I have no qualm in saying that Casablanca is my favorite of all time. And here is why. I did many a research paper on this cinematic gem. The reasons behind its success, the movie stars and their issues, the complete misunderstanding that they NEVER say ""Play it again, Sam"" (come on people, get it right) but nothing will ever speak to me as much as the nostalgia that comes with the Black and White motif and seeing Rick smoke a cigarette while playing craps as Sam plays ""As Time Goes By"". The softness of the movie, along with its Nationalistic overtones was so important to America is the WW2 times. It created soldiers so soon after the devastation of WW1. But besides that part of it, the love story of 2 who were so destined to be together that time could only keep them apart for so long. And the ending. Ah, the ending. That is my favorite. A man choosing to save the people he loves and cares for, more than save himself. What a groundbreaking and creative masterpiece."
"GeoPierpont","8","0","2","9 April 2015"," For the Corrupt Poor
","What a cast of characters, if you are familiar with the careers of the major and minor leads, this is old school film buff heaven! I treasure a delicious intrigue and Casablanca delivers on all fronts. There is the foreign affairs effect, tense drama, fear filled moments, historical references, comedy, music, and a conflicted romance. For 1942 or thereabouts, not much competition imho.<br/><br/>My major issue lies with the semblance of a decision for Ilsa regarding leaving her husband. Who could ever find this a plausible plot given she is already married, in love with the cause, comprehends her role in it, and deeply admires him since childhood. I did not find anything believable in a suspense ending given the aforementioned elements, but only the possible Nazi confrontation before the plane departure. <br/><br/>The unexpected one liners were truly hilarious amidst the tense drama of escapes, persecution and liberation. The many representations of foreigners aligned as allies was inspiring, to wit the German vs French hit parade performance. I had not heard ""La Marseillaise"" since High School and was impressed I was able to recall so many lines. <br/><br/>Although many consider this a propaganda film, it accomplishes this with subtlety. The drop of the Vichy water bottle in the trash bin hints at the power of many countries aligned to defeat the Axis.<br/><br/>High recommend for foreign war POV, star performances, life in French Morocco, and a black and white blue parrot."

","A great filmmaker once told me there are two kinds of films. Slick and sloppy. I don't like to watch films more than once but I have seen this film 10 times and it never gets old. The dialog is sharp, the photography is great, the acting superb, the editing is right on. I'm not even a fan of B&W but this one shines. I don't know if it's because of the war (it was made in the middle of WWII) or Bogart or Claude Rains (the casting is perfect)but I cannot find anything wrong with this film. I especially like the searchlight effect that can be seen outside the windows. Peter Lorre, Sidney Greenstreet are excellent supporting cast members. The ambiance is so smooth.

","After seeing this film, it's no question as to why this is widely considered to be one of the greatest films ever made. Director Michael Curtiz did essentially everything perfect. The plot, lighting, sounds, and even the political message was clear and well done. Humphrey Bogart (Rick Blaine) did a great job playing a character who is quite powerful and doesn't like to get involved in other peoples affairs. What makes this film so significant is the political message at the time. At this point in history, America attempted to stay out of the affairs of other countries of the world. Rick Blaine represents America in this film. As time went on and the war started to become a threat to our everyday lives, America became involved. As the story of Casablanca goes on, Rick becomes more involved as well. What I also enjoyed about this film is that while so many different things are going on, a simple love story is unwinding and it is quite a good one. Overall, this is one of the best films of that era and would recommend to anyone."

","Casablanca seems to be one of those films you've always heard about but don't really know why. It's a household movie title, while many people may have never even seen it. This movie is definitely one to watch though. The way this movie was able to bring real world issues to the movie screen and turn it into a movie full of different genres is incredible. Between the tragic love stories and mysterious plans of the main character this film was definitely meant to be a classic. Director Michael Curtiz's vision for this film was to bring the real world issue surrounding Nazi France was brought forth very will. The use of lighting in this movie was really key to making it what it was. There were uses of silhouette, darkness in certain places, and the lighting of key characters to explain the great importance of different scenes and or characters. Overall this movie is on of those classics that is a must watch. As well as one of those movies that you can watch over and over again and find new things every time."

Desert played for night even at day, Bogart the beautiful and Bergman the brusque, convoluted and borderline irrelevant WWII backdrop that buoys the main action... I love movies that can blend genres and feelings seamlessly, and this one is what -- romance, noir, thriller, comedy, war movie?

Every character had an agenda and it was up the audience figure it out. I have to say although the plot was explained to me, there was just so much going on and I am sure there were many subtle jokes that I missed.

Where the movie really shined was in it's camera work, the shots, angles, and lighting were fantastic.

","Casablanca directed by Micheal Curtiz is certainly one of the best films of the 20th century and perhaps of all time. Casablanca takes place in a Vichy controlled part of Africa during the early years of WW2. Rick, the main character is played by Humphrey Bogart, who knocked the role out of the part with this ground breaking performance. Rick is sort tough guy who owns Ricks Cafe Americaine, he eventually runs into an old lover named Ilsa played by Ingrid Bergman. Bergman left him heart broken in Paris and now is asking for his help. Casablanca is one of the greatest romance films of all time, the acting of Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman were astounding. The movie caught many by surprise because it was not a highly anticipated film, and did not really have a huge budget, however the acting and story makes Casablanca a Hollywood perfection."
"aladar-219-783287","8","0","2","10 March 2015"," Casablanca - My Review
","I remember viewing this on iTunes a long while back, when I was in high school. I had obviously heard of it and I was curious about it as a film. I rented it on iTunes and watched it for myself, but at the time I didn't get into it as much as I did now. I couldn't quite follow the story and it was hard to discern because of the history in which this movie was made. Now is a different story.<br/><br/>I was very impressed with how this film was presented, because the darks and lights in this film was wonderful, especially with Rick in the bar; very aesthetic and lovely to look at it. That, and having known some of the history now, the movie was so much more enjoyable to watch now that I had a better understanding of what was going on. It was still a bit hard on occasion to catch up to the story but its progression was an interesting one.<br/><br/>The one thing that put me off was Rick's character. The actors were apparently German, so his NYC accent was a little funny. I enjoy British TV Shows and notice that some actors who do American-based characters tend to go with this monotone-sounding accent to distinguish an American one from the Northeast. It wasn't bad, but I could tell that he was foreign. That put me off just a little bit, but his acting in general was what made it for me.<br/><br/>Witnessing that famous scene at the end was a like a blast from the past. My family has a Disney Vacation membership and I used to go to Disney World every year for several years before stopping when I was 15, and at the time (before MGM was renovated) the Great Movie ride in what is now Hollywood Studios featured that scene from the movie with the airplane and all. I loved the Great Movie Ride, which has since been revised from what I remember from my childhood, but that part of Casablanca was something I could not describe in words. It really made me smile, like it did when I was in the Great Movie Ride. I will return there for my 21st birthday, but I'll miss the way the Great Movie Ride used to be.<br/><br/>For the film, though, the rating I gave is not based on what I think it is, but what it deserves. It's a classic of its time and I found its characters so engaging and interesting that I felt like it was an apt rating."

","Being that it is a renowned classic I had a lot of expectations when going in to watch Casablanca. But if I'm being completely honest I believe that it was a bit over sold, not to say that I didn't enjoy the movie; I really did enjoy it. I found the plot of the movie to be very engaging and not too hard to follow and the acting was absolutely amazing. I thought there was so much to take in, which I really enjoyed and there many round characters that had great character development. I really enjoyed the character of Rick and how he progressed throughout the movie. I also very much so loved all of the quick witted humor that filled the movie and you either got it or you didn't, it wasn't highlighted at all. And besides the writing and the performances of the cast I really loved the lighting used throughout the movie and thought that it helped to amplify the story significantly. Overall, I really enjoyed the movie and will most likely watch it again because I believe that there is a lot more that I could take from the movie, if I were to go back and re- watch it."
"dougdoepke","Null","0","2","9 March 2015"," An ""All-Time Best""-- A Critical Perspective
","I'm not sure what makes this WWII film still an all-time best. Nonetheless, I can certainly see why audiences continue to like it. But an all-time critical best should include more than audience popularity.<br/><br/>There're a number of assets on the movie's plus side. Certainly, the effort's an outstanding production from a number of standpoints. The cast amounts to a real slice of serendipity. Aside from the compelling leads, just about every colorful Warner Bros. support player gets a turn, including that mad Russian Leonid Kinskey (the bartender). Then too, the screenplay amounts to a triumph of individual moments that happily evolve into a satisfying whole, while the script itself manages a number of well-known throw-away lines that still resonate. Moreover, direction under Mike Curtiz keeps things moving in what's often a single set (Rick's Club). Plus Curtiz has an uncanny knack of coming up with the right close-up at the right emotional time. In short, the production's a masterpiece of Hollywood craftsmanship, the elements fitting darn near perfectly together.<br/><br/>Perhaps more importantly, the film's theme strikes a key audience chord. Rick's a wounded idealist who for cloudy reasons has closed himself off to all emotions and commitments. He's become a complete political cynic, even after fighting against the fascists in Spain. Why this has happened is not made clear (unless I missed something), but it also has to do with his unhappy affair with Ilsa (Bergmann). Now his club in Casablanca has become a gathering spot for characters of all political stripes-- Nazi, Vichy French, Free French, anti-Fascist, or plain refugees fleeing a war-torn Europe. But it's really his relationship with Ilsa and Vichy cop Renault (Rains) that's pivotal to the story's outcome.<br/><br/>Now, there's an apparent subtext to Rick's evolution that's symbolic of events in the early stages of WWII. Rick's disengagement from politics mirrors America's tradition of isolation from European conflicts. (Note here how Rick has fought in Spain mirrors America's exception by fighting in WWI.) As a result, neither Rick nor an isolationist US makes a moral distinction between the various parties (England, France, Nazi Germany) to WWII in its earliest stages. Thus, only by overcoming his cynicism can Rick recognize the evil Nazism represents, in the same way that only by breaking out of an isolationist stance can the US combat the menace Nazism poses.<br/><br/>Here the analogy between Rick's behavior and US policy breaks down. As I see it, Rick comes to see Victor's (Henreid) anti-Nazi moral value through his recurring love for Ilsa, even though Ilsa is married now to Victor. But if Ilsa is willing to sacrifice her happiness so that Victor can lead people against the Nazis, then Rick the cynic must reckon with Victor's ultimate moral worth. And by so doing, he recovers his own moral compass, which in a noble act of selflessness, enables the married couple to return to the European struggle. Thus Rick has taken a stand just as the US would do.<br/><br/>I think this is a satisfying climax to events, but it wouldn't be nearly so memorable without the foggy airport staging, and cop Renault rejecting his Vichy authority and departing with Rick into what may be the ""Beginning of a beautiful friendship"". Both have now seen the light even amidst the foggy future.<br/><br/>Now, if ranking movies were simply about craftsmanship, I'd rate Casablanca one of the best. But all-around bests have to include more than craftsmanship. There is an essential area where I think the movie falls short. That is, it's tied very much to its time period. Finding a moral compass may be a universal challenge, and in that sense, a human condition. But here finding that compass is tied too specifically to the historical evils of Nazism, not to a more trans-historical condition that would have universal application.<br/><br/>In that specific regard, compare Casablanca with 1951's award winning A Place In The Sun. Both are expertly cast and produced. However, it's hard to think of the 1942 movie without thinking specifically of the Nazis as the catalyst. The 1951 film, on the other hand, concerns no particular time period. Instead, it's about the corruptive appeal of wealth and glamour on a particular individual (Monty Clift's character). The seductions of wealth and power, of course, are trans-historical. So, the lasting impression of that movie has application now as well as then, even though the ending, unlike Casablanca, is no crowd-pleaser.<br/><br/>My overall point is not to derogate the 1942 film. It remains a triumph of studio movie- making. On the other hand, I don't think it qualifies as an all-time critical best, even if it does star filmdom's favorite covert idealist, Humphrey Bogart."

The love story seemed kind of cheesy; although, I did really enjoy the main character and who he represented throughout the film. Humphrey Bogart, Richard, represented the Americans throughout the war, which represented isolationism. Richard shows isolation in the film by never drinking with anyone. My favorite line throughout the movie was ""I'll stick my neck out for nobody"" and then the General replied with ""Ah, a wise foreign policy."" I think that was totally great. Another great aspect of the movie was the lighting. I think it was great when the light reflected off the sides of their faces and off the tops and brims of their hats.

Shooting had begun on May 25th of that same year -- with an unfinished script. The myths over who wrote what, and when, have become as much of cinema lore as the film's plot itself. In an interview on Dec. 3, 1987, Jules J. Epstein -- one of the three credited writers on the film -- said even he was uncertain: ""To tell you the truth, it's almost impossible to tell who wrote what now. I read somewhere that (producer) Hal Wallis said he wrote the movie's last line -- when Bogart says to Claude Rains (a Vichy minion who helped Ingrid Bergman and Paul Henreid's characters escape the Nazis): 'I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship.' And that could be. We originally had Rains saying that line, then Bogart finishing with, ""Yeah, but don't forget you owe me 10,000 francs.' We writers thought that last was more typical of him, but it was changed and it may have been Hal who changed it. At the time there was much confusion because the studio had a deadline -- 52 films were released each year, and this was just one of them. We were like any other film -- we took 30 days to film, maybe a couple of days more, and that was it."" Jules Epstein, his brother Philip and Howard Koch won screen writing Oscars for their work on the film, which also earned Academy Awards for best picture and best director (Michael Curtiz). Said Koch in a separate interview: ""Looking back, the picture seemed to have a life of its own. Whatever happened to it seemed to be for the good. I had an almost mystical feel to it."" Jules Epstein and Koch said two endings were considered. The first -- and the one that was used -- had Bergman flying to Lisbon with her husband (Henreid), leaving Bogart behind. The second had her staying with Bogart. Contrary to Hollywood legend, only the first ending was actually shot. ""Bergman was the one who was worried about which ending we would use,"" Epstein said. ""It didn't bother Bogart -- nobody looked at it as a classic film, and he made four or five pictures a year anyway. Bergman came up to us on the set and asked, 'How can I play love scenes without knowing which man I end up with? Which one will it be?' And we told her, 'As soon as we know, we'll let you know.'"" In yet another interview Henreid said he knew all along what no one else knew -- that, under terms of his contract, he had to wind up with Bergman, something which even the writers didn't know. ""There were no two ways about it,"" Henreid said. ""That was written in the contract and signed by Warner Brothers. You musn't forget, they were very unsure of Bogart at that point. The film that brought him 'Casablanca' was 'High Sierra,' and the star of 'High Sierra' was not Bogart -- it was Ida Lupino."""
"Paddy-49","9","0","1","27 June 2014"," A serendipitous masterpiece
","Casablanca is a perfect artistic creation. It is a film which cannot be improved upon and one that, more than 70 years on, still has the power to surprise, amaze and entertain. It is not, and was never I think meant to be, realistic. By this I mean not just that it is not a true story but that it could never conceivably have been seen to be. The broad canvas of the city of Casablanca in the early years of the Second World War is authentic but the story which unfolds, the characters and the detail is of course fiction. This in no way negates the legitimacy of the movie which is far deeper than just telling a story would be. In this respect it is very akin to a painting or a sonnet. A painting is constrained by the two- dimensional static format and a sonnet by the rules of verse. But that doesn't mean that powerful messages cannot be conveyed. So it is with Casablanca. <br/><br/>This is a film about love, betrayal, honour, sacrifice, loyalty, friendship, man's capacity for evil as well as for goodness. It is about judgment, weakness, kindness, passion, greed, and how even the most venal power can be overcome with courage. Put like that it sounds a bit pious but, of course, it is not pious at all. It is exceptionally humorous at times. The constraint is imposed by the need to reduce complex human emotions to filmable moments. It is full of metaphors which help this along. ""As time goes by"" is not a theme song but a symbol of times past not time present. Rick had forbidden Sam to play the song because it stirred too strongly the memories of his and Ilsa's time together in Paris. When Ilsa turns up in Casablanca she insists that Sam plays it and so signals her wish to return in some way to Rick. <br/><br/>The playing of the Marseillaise in the bar to rebut the Germans is symbolic of the struggle between good and evil. It is a courageous and provocative thing to do. And it contrasts neatly with the character development of Rick and the police Chief Renault. Each of them has to be pragmatic to survive and they cheat, lie and deceive as part of this. But as we suspect from the start with Rick, and come to learn with Renault deep down these are good men. The means justifies the ends if those ends are honourable. Rick, like many great heroes (there is an intriguing parallel with Oskar Schindler here) has to be tough and do things he would prefer not to do. But when tested he comes up trumps. There is an illustrative sub plot with a young Bulgarian newly married couple who Rick helps to get exit visas to Lisbon, he doesn't need to do this and there are risks. But inspired by his inherent sense of decency he does it. <br/><br/>Casablanca is a love story - or actually two. The one between Humphrey Bogart's Rick and Ingrid Bergman's Ilsa and the one between Ilsa and her husband Victor Lazslo. Bergman's performance is sensational. The close-ups show her astonishing beauty and make Rick's passion for her wholly credible. There is an intriguing moral sub plot about Ilsa and Rick's brief affair in Paris (shown in flashback). We learn that Lazslo was missing presumed dead when this happened. This reduces the adulterous nature of the liaison - maybe a nod to the moral precepts of Hollywood in 1942? We also learn that Ilsa's failure to escape Paris with Rick is because Viktor has turned up - something that Rick was unaware of. <br/><br/>Casablanca is a highly moral film - ironically because few of the characters seem to have strong moral principles at all. But, as we have seen, this is artifice. Lazslo is a man of high moral attitudes with a track record to match. Ilsa supports him and loves him for this and when it comes to the crunch she chooses her husband over Rick. Though Rick himself makes this easy for her by insisting at the end that she fly off with Lazslo rather than stay in Casablanca with him. <br/><br/>The greatness of Casablanca comes from the ménage a trois and from the colourful key supporting characters. It comes from the juxtaposition of good and evil all within the claustrophobic tight world of wartime Casablanca. It comes too from the tight, pacy direction and a clever evocation of time and place. The film is iconic with dialogue that has entered the vernacular ""Here's looking at you kid"" ""This is the beginning of a beautiful friendship"" ""round up the usual suspects."" ""We'll always have Paris"" ""Play it Sam, play 'As Time Goes By'"" ""Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but soon and for the rest of your life."" But above all it comes from the characters and from their portrayal by a cast all at the top of their form.<br/><br/>Movies unlike paintings or poems are collective endeavours. Assemble the right actors. Write a filmable script. Get a good Director. And yet, and yet. It isn't enough. Casablanca works because these basics are right. If is a masterpiece because, serendipitously, what is in part a random collection of elements somehow works as a whole. The whole far exceeds the sum of the parts."

","Aside from being one standout film with respect to the technical aspects Casablanca also entertains some very high quality characters. Through use of lighting, both high and low key the film creates a powerful ambiance that enhances the audiences perception of the different emotions characters are feeling at a given time. Regarding significance Rick Blaine exhibits a persona that reflects a man with noble character. Although he originally planned to flee a soon to be Nazi invaded country with his ex-lover and at the same time frame her husband for a crime, he realized the error of his ways and acts in great redemption before his lies destroy the life of an innocent man. Initially when his ex-lover and him reconnected, after they had spent some time together when she ended up in the same town as him, they orchestrated a plan to have her husband arrested for stealing exit visas and then use those exit visas to flee the country together. During the time in which the plan was to be carried out Rick does otherwise. He sees to it that the husband is not arrested and that he and his wife get a plane with the exit visas. Although his ex-lover demands to stay with him he persuades her to leave with her husband by telling her she will regret it. What is noble about this is Rick overcomes his sense of lust for the women and assets that she carry out the life she promised her husband by marrying him. This deviates from the common result of films that have forbidden lovers. Whereas most movie characters subdue to the lust they feel Rick acknowledges the importance of faithfulness and respect for another man over desire. This type of significance is seldom found in films but Casablanca is an immaculate display of such. Among other messages I feel this was the films most important and iconic one."

I thought the story line drag a little in some parts, and I may stand alone in that however the visuals I think made up for my lack in interest. This movie was shot in black and white and I don't think it could have been better in any other way, the black and white added glamor and beauty to a lot of the scenes. Also the lighting was key in this movie, a lot of the lighting was soft lighting especially when Ingrid Bergman was the focus of the frame. The image had a soft filter and it gave Bergman this innocent and glow. Using the soft lighting in this movie also added to the romantic mood of a lot of the scenes. The use of shadows was also very apparent in this movie. One scene that used low key lighting was when Bergman is up in Humphrey Bogarts room hiding, the lights are off and she has a large shadow casting across her, this use of shadow gives us the tone of the scene, and really insist that she must stay hidden in the shadows. Casablanca also uses high key and hard lighting in the film to create crisp and clear pictures as well. Soft and hard lighting will even be used in the same scene. An example of this being used is in the ending scene when Bogart is saying goodbye to Bergman's character. The camera will do a close up of Bogarts face and it will be in hard lighting, the image is very clear and crisp of his face, we can see every wrinkle under his eyes and such, however when the shot switches to a close up of Bergman's face we see her in a soft lighting like I have mentioned before. This make her look young and glowy. The contrast is very apparent and really sets the two characters apart. Casablanca is a classic movie and I urge you to pay a lots of attention to the images and photography on the screen!"

He took influence from German Expressionist films of the 20s and this influence is definitely well represented with all of the beautiful lighting and shadows and every range in between that he was well in control of. The cast was perfectly picked for these roles, each of them seems very natural in their expressions and reactions. Each of the sets are extremely detailed, and the special effects like the airplane would have been a big deal at the time.

","""Casablanca"" is worth the praise it receives, and perhaps more. It's nearly easy to pick up and settle into, and, if patience pays off, you'll be rewarded with mixture of great characters, wonderful atmosphere, and a dramatic plot. Humphrey Bogart comes of as one of the most interesting characters in movie history. He displays both his organization and his corruption. He plays both a winner and a loser, and I think that shows how different he is from the other characters. Ingrid Bergman also shares these traits, but the overall outcome of the story is in Bogart's hands, so all Bergman can do is reflect on her decisions throughout the film. Another character worth a quick shout-out is Dooley Wilson. He wasn't given as much clever or reflective dialogue as Bogart, but that's not to say he's pointless. Wilson is the shadow that follows Bogart: He plays songs for him that can even sometimes reflect on what he thinks about (""As Time Goes By""). He stuck with Bogart from France to Casablanca and continued working for him. In a way, he acts as a symbolic reminder of Bogart's life with Bergman."

The film takes place in Casablance a free French run city in the early stages of WWII. Casablanca is a stop on the best escape route from Europe to the United States,and is therefore home to a diverse group of people from all of Europe. While the events, and people in the film are historically significant, at its core the film is a love story. It is a story about Rick Blaine, played by Humphrey Bogart, an American bar owner in Casablanca. He is a no nonsense man's man who sticks his neck out for no one. Rick finds himself in the middle of a political mess when he is secretly entrusted with valuable documents that are sought by the authorities, and desired by many. The story turns when Ilsa (Ingrid Bergman) shows up at Rick's bar. Ilsa had loved Rick and broke his heart turning him into the hard man we see. Rick, Ilsa, and the other characters are entertaining as the plot twists and turns to its unpredictable finish. Bogart's performance is the best I've ever seen on film. As a viewer you feel his emotions deeply, and relate to him wholeheartedly. His character is a complicated one, which makes his performance that much better.

The plot, which was about World War 2, was very relatable to those during that time of crisis. It shows how much power the Germans really did have over other countries and the people. This love story is very compelling and edgy because the two characters are in a funk that they had a love for each other before, but cannot seem to ever be together because of certain circumstances. The love that Rick has for Ilsa is so unselfish that he makes decisions for her that will affect her life in a good way, causing him to lose the girl he once and does love. This goes to show that many people are willing to give up their feelings for another person's well-being."

","So, like my summary would suggest, all I can truly say about this film is wow. While that is certainly not very articulate, that was the initial feeling I had after watching this film. Everything about this film, the unique location, plot, scenery, and outstanding performances worked in conjunction to make this film great. Obviously Humphrey Bogart stood alone in his portrayal of American freedom fighter/idealist turned bar owner, Rick Blaine. The little nuances he is able to bring to the character turned Rick from just another person on the screen to one that I could not take my eyes off of. In addition, and this is the one thing that really made the film great, was the comedy. It goes without saying that World War II and the horrors that accompanied it are nothing to take lightly; however, this film was genuinely funny almost all the way through. For instance, in the scene where the young couple approached the French officer Louis, and says they will be at his office at six, and he in turn replies,"" OK, i will be there at ten."" I mean, come on, to be able to interject such a humorous tone into a film that deals with issues of considerable weight is nothing short of great. Another aspect of the film that is particularly worth mention is the somewhat cheesy, but necessary love story, for it allows the audience to experience the full range and emotions of the actors character development. As a viewer, you feel for Elsa and Lazlo, even though Rick is obviously the first choice for Elsa's affection. Moreover, it is this same ""cheesy"" love that allows Rick to make the necessary sacrifice of allowing Lazlo and Elsa to escape to Lisbon with the documents they had so severely coveted. If Rick were a man of lesser character or measure, he could have simply withheld the documents and let the chips fall where they may, so to speak. Lastly, the films overall feel is superb. As I stated earlier, the unique choice of location, the sets, and hegemony between all of the characters, french, German, and others, makes for an excellent viewing experience. I had only previously heard of this film and how good it was, but I am glad that now I have had the experience firsthand. I definitely recommend this film."

","This is a beautiful and memorable movie and is a classic film for a reason. The plot is about a cold and selfish nightclub owner that meets his long lost love and thus slowly shows the reason behind why the way he is. There is a lot of other things going on, especially since it has Nazi official and refugees wanting to reach the United States all while taking place in Casablanca. This movie has very iconic scenes that will be portrayed in other films and TV shows, there will be a lot of parodies as well. Simply put this is a magical film and is the epitome of what a classic film-making is. Humphrey Bogart was just phenomenal playing the nightclub owner Rick, his voice is also iconic, especially for a film like this. I still think this movie might be slightly overrated since it's not as powerful or emotional as I thought it would be but for it's time I can see why some people would think this is a masterpiece.<br/><br/>8.1/10"

","The cinematography in this movie is unparalleled. The dark lighting and heavy shadows create that classic film noir feeling that gives this movie the dramatic effect. One thing that I really liked is that there are a lot of close up and medium close ups that really focus the viewers attention on who is speaking and allow us to concentrate on the story. A very creative aspect to the movie is how we don't find out the story between Rick and Ilsa all at once. Flashbacks and the use of the character Sam allow us to slowly figure out the situation between the two. The dramatic twist at the end comes as an unexpected but valiant move and shows Rick to be the character that we didn't quite see him as throughout the rest of the movie."

","I don't know that it's possible for a 19 year old kid to say anything new about this movie. Is it a classic? Ehhh, maybe but probably not since i'm going to have a hard time stretching this review out to 10 lines. Luckily, Bogart's performance gives me something to talk about because, as always, his acting is captivating. Without he and Bergman this film would fall flat. The romance is pretty cheesy and formulaic. Plug in any attractive blonde and she could play Ilsa and any big brute of a man could play Laszlo. Hell, the fact that Peter Lorre's character was more interesting than Laszlo speaks volumes to the nature of this film. It's a good movie without a doubt but i just don't get the common tag of greatest film of all time. The only thing really stopping me from giving this movie lower than a 7 is Bogart. He just draws you in as an actor and i can't remember the last bad film i watched with him in it."

","Casablanca (1942) was directed by Michael Curtiz and started being filmed right after the Pearl Harbor bombing on December 7, 1941. The movie is about two Germans who were killed in the very beginning in Morocco (Then occupied by France). The main character (Humphrey Bogart) obtained Letters of Transit that he was going to use to escape Morocco before the German invasion. This movie came out in the midst of the U.S. arrival in World War II, and the way it showed how the Nazi's would lose and the American's would win in the movie. At the time, people had no idea who would win the war.<br/><br/>In the very beginning of the film when they first showed Rick's Cafe, they showed police spotlights that flashed by the main door in a very distinct way. Lighting was specifically used later in the film they had Rick behind a curtain and you could see his shadow and all of the motions that he was making too with inverse lighting effects."

It might not seem that good at the beginning but don't just shut it off really watch it and trust me you will get into it. I didn't think I would but I did. This is a romantic film.

","The lighting and photography in Casablanca (1942) was phenomenal.In the beginning when we are shown the streets of Casablanca, the shot contains so much activity and movement it appeals visually to the viewer almost immediately. The same can be said when we first are shown Rick's club, the amount of contrast and so many things moving at once (and bright) in one shot. There is a scene when the police chief is talking to Rick while Rick is out of the shot. Rick's shadow is seen clearly against the wall and it appears as if the chief is talking directly to Rick's shadow. A good visual effect. In the scene when Rick is drinking and sulking in the middle of the night, the lighting (or lack of) and shadows totally set the depressing mood for that scene. The protagonists are mostly seen wearing brighter/lighter colored clothing. I like that the social message of the film was one of anti-Nazisentiment, especially because at the time of the film's release the war had not been won yet. The dialog was witty and fast paced. Very good film."

","Casablanca is a great movie. There are many things that make this movie what it is. From the lighting to the timeless quotes I believe every aspect of this movie was done excellently. The two areas besides what the average viewer would notice that I would like to comment on are the lighting and the camera movement. First off the lighting through out the film helped to set every scene and the search light at night especially served as a reminder that despite the night clubs and the open markets Casablanca was not a totally free town. The other technical aspect that set this movie apart was the camera movement. The director managed to always have the cameras in the perfect place and all movements were very smooth. This film will always be a must see for any movie buffs."

","Great film. Humphrey Bogart really makes it. This movie is so exceptionally well done. The storyline in so complex but is conveyed in such a simple form. Bogarts character is so round that his emotions and character development is what makes this movie so complex but exhilarating. He starts off being carefree, doesn't care for anyone, Shows no concern towards death or the war and hates just about everyone. He's a true gambler. He's just a bar owner who only cares for himself. But then when he finds his true love the story twists to an entire new perspective and Bogart develops character, just something you have to see. Another exceptional feature to this film is the lighting, some of the darkest scenes are lit so appropriately. I also really enjoyed the mood that was conveyed in Casablanca, it was really fun to watch. Good photography, exceptional acting and a very developed story with twists and turns all over. Very good movie."

","The lighting in this movie is phenomenal and very expressive. Rick's Café Americain provided the perfect scene in which to express various lighting techniques that foreshadowed the pasts and the futures of the characters that found refuge there. Particular attention was paid to Ingrid Bergman's character where the light dazzled in her eyes, caught the top of her hair, and shadowed her face in the reflection of a mysterious woman with pain and sorrow as much as happiness and joy. The bars that shadowed the walls in the scenes that peaked into Rick's office, as if we were spying or stumbling onto something forbidden, portrayed the secret lives of Rick and Ilsa and the cage that not only they, but others caught in the net set by the Nazi's, lived in."

","The film Casablanca was directed by Micharl Curtiz in 1942. This American romance drama tells the story of how fate tried to bring two people together. The main character(played by Humphrey Bogart) is faced with a major dilemma. HE can either run off with the girl whom he has feelings for or he can let her go and potentially help fight the good fight. The movie was released around the time of world war 2 so there is a strong military presence during the whole thing. The dialogue and screenplay are remarkable adding to the power of the story.

","Casablanca is a film made in 1942, the film was directed by Michael Curtiz. The film has many themes and issues that are easy for viewers to relate to. Morality and self-sacrifice are two of the most common themes in Casablanca. The main character Rick Blaine is torn between doing what he knows is right and staying true to his love. Rick Blaine is not the only character willing to give up everything for there love. Victor Laszlo and Ilsa Lund are intertwined with the character Rick. Ilsa is the object of both Victor and Rick's affection. In the beginning of the film Rick is a cynical character who has no interest in helping anyone. In one of the scene Rick says "" he doesn't stick his neck out for anyone."" Speaking about himself in regards to giving Victor the transit letters in order for him to leave Casablanca. As the film progresses Rick has a change in heart, double-crossing people in order to assist Victor and Ilsa in their escape. Rick forgets about his love for Ilsa and resentment for Victor and gives them the transits in order for them to have safe refuge away from Casablanca.<br/><br/>There were some scenes in Rick's café that the cinematography was excellent. The light and shadows were especially intricate on the side of Ilsa Lunds' face. Creating a soft tone against the left side of her face. Another scene that I found the lighting absolutely phenomenal was at the end of the film with Captain Louis and Rick. The dark shadows along the left outer edges and the lighter shadow on the right part of the frame creates a light dark frame in which the two men are seen. The light and dark shadows create almost of fog around the scene."

","I wouldn't say it was the best film ever made because it isn't. On the contrary though, it is a classic film that anyone would love and it is to me the grandfather of clichés. First off saying someone doesn't have a soul is clearly cold in my opinion because maybe they are literary, don't watch movies or just didn't understand it and they don't need to be penalized for it. It's an old film noir with really great dialog and amazing acting ( ahead of it's time) and it brings in what most cinema's have today, the art of clichés. First of all the main character Rick is a prime example of a tough guy, not buff, but he proves muscles don't make the man. Then you have Ilsa, the love of Rick's life and she bring the acting game up well. Now Ilsa is married to a guy named Victor Laszlo, and things get very complicated as the German police start to threaten throwing him in an isolation camp and you just have to see it for yourself. It starts with the atmosphere as the Warner theme plays and the map of Casablanca fades in, which loads of films used a lot later and gives that it is an action adventure romance. Next is the dialog, which strongly is by far the best I've heard in a movie to date which adds both mystery, romance, drama and most important humor which is kind of lacked in movies today. To continue we have the battle of the instruments (used in comedies), the mild bar fight which looked incredibly stunning for 1943( though it only lasted about 40 seconds) and finally a signature in westerns, the who shoots first duel at the very end which was fast paced but timed and played out very well. All in all a great film and as Rick said "" This looks like the beginning of a beautiful friendship"". It's worth it."

It is most certainly a movie I would enjoy to watch again to pick up the little details I had missed the first time. From what I saw and what I had gathered from this movie, I can see how iconic it really is.<br/><br/>With everything that was going on in the movie, there was a nice love story that was just as fast paced as the movie was. The character Rick at first just seemed like a stubborn and not so emotional man but he starts to unravel over the course of the movie. The audience starts to see he is hurt that the love of his life is gone and now back in his life but is conflicted with what to do even though she is married. It is obvious the two still love each other and the tension and bitterness between the two of the them is apparent but, I felt the love story still worked within this."

Going into the film my expectations were a bit high, so that could have something to do with my final thoughts. I expected my mind to be blown, and to a certain degree i suppose it was. This was my first exposure to the legendary actor, Humphrey Bogart, and i was surely impressed. His acting is simply legendary and for me, he made the entire movie. The visuals were also very eye appealing. I must admit that about midway through i did get a little lost, and tried to regain focus but just couldn't.

","Strictly speaking Casablanca is not about WW 2. It is not about living in a foreign land and not knowing if you will ever get to a better place. It is also not necessarily a love story, at least not in the sense that it is about whether or not to people will fall in love and end happily ever after. At it's core Casablanca is about the effect that two people can have on each other and what effect the crossing of two paths can do. In almost every conceivable way Casablanca was one of the best technical cinematic works ever made. Every shot was elegant and extremely thought out. Weather it was a scene with one person in a dark room or a crowded street in the bright of day, nothing is out of place. Nothing is over or under done. While the story is well done it is also, in a way, boiler plated. I don't mean to say this negatively, rather as a complement to how timeless this story truly is. It could conceivably happen anywhere or any time in history. With all this said, I believe the most compelling and significant part of this movie is how it helped vault the American cinema to the top of the world."

The love story you see take place in the film is already half over when the film starts. I thought that we were going to be able to see the two characters meet and fall in love, however they had already met and are already in love from the beginning of the film.

"ostergaardof4","9","0","2","3 July 2010"," It's a classic for a reason
","Casablanca Michael Curtiz (1942)<br/><br/>Casablanca is many things, but mostly it was a perfect storm of production values at the time it was made. In 1941 the world was just getting to the worst of its second self involved war and Hollywood was at the height of production studio centered glory, open and ripe for the attention of the power-jealous paranoids of the 50s. The people making Casablanca had everything needed to make the most popular movie in history (sorry Titanic, lets see you attract people over and over at festivals –what? You can't? Oh, that's right, you blew your load.).<br/><br/>They had exotic settings, a ready made situation to forever tug at people's heartstrings, timeless leading actors (there is no era in fashion history that Bogart and Bergman would look bad in) ridiculously awesome supporting cast of character actors—the breadth of which I doubt will ever be seen again (a rant for another day!).<br/><br/>Best movie ever made, no, not critically or technically. Critics tend to allow Casablanca into the annals of Best Films Ever because it is so enduringly and solidly good. Nothing big. Nothing fancy. No great arguments about hubris, mortality, social issues – what have you – like Citizen Kane or All About Eve. Just Nazis and unfulfilled sex. I ask you, what is wrong with this?<br/><br/>The direction does nothing but build tension and alert viewers to whose a baddie and whose a goodie. What you don't see, in fact, is the direction. Casablanca is seamlessly plot-tastic. <br/><br/>And what a plot. Few works of fiction sell unrequited love so convincingly or realistically. Not only do they acknowledge that a person can love two different people equally and still retain honor and nobility and all that, but we actually buy the motivations behind all three people in the triangle. AND! It is resolved in a perfectly tragic pit of hope for the future without relying on the ""babies = hope"" crutch. <br/><br/>More intricately, political intrigue and double crossing are never going to get old. The only thing that would ever truly date this movie is the political intrigue. Because Nazis are actual, historical bad guys, and tied to a very specific place and time, it's possible that cultures outside of SUA, and/or a couple generations down the line will not care so quickly or easily for ""the troubles of three little people"" on the run from the Third Reich. Luckily! There is a slick little intro with a model globe and voice-over which introduces the time and place very nicely. If you were an alien and knew nothing of earth history, but were profoundly human—sentimentally—you'd get it. <br/><br/>Where the direction picks up after all this awesome, is in the details. Every time I watch Casablanca I find a new detail that reinforces a character or setting. Usually they're shadows. The shadow of Rick opening his safe, the dancing girl shadow in The Blue Parrot, the shadow of scurrying French underground braves... They add depth to otherwise static blocking and cardboard sets. <br/><br/>The continual usage of shadow is probably my favorite, non-plot related thing. When combined with the fact that everyone smokes constantly in this movie, the world of northern Africa is orientalized in the sexiest of all possible ways—subtly. <br/><br/>Two things I've noticed that can actually be considered mistakes: Hand- wound mending. One of the shadows shows Rick opening a safe...he does not close it in the same scene... hm... <br/><br/>First viewing, I fell asleep. Bored. Hated it. I don't know when I watched it the first time and liked it. I honestly don't remember, but by my first year of college I couldn't stop watching it. Bought a poster in an antique store, hung it in my dorm room as a declaration of my superior taste to all the Animal House posters. Consequently I become immediate friends with the girl across the hall who's choice was Cool Hand Luke. We were so damn cool. They were destroyed by asbestos and we had to buy a new ones, not vintage. Sad."

","This was the first time I have ever watched Casablanca, I thought it was alright. Yes, I know it's a classic, but I was really liked the plot a lot and the story line. I liked how it was places during World War 2. I thought that the directing and camera work was great. The picture was clear and the camera movement was steady. Also the acting was amazing, I especially enjoyed the most of the characters, I did like Humphrey which I guess a lot of people didn't. I thought the movie did go a little slow and could have been edited a little bit better in some places. I think this movie would have been better to watch in color for the first time."

","There's so many reasons to like Casablanca, it's almost immeasurable. But I'm going to try.<br/><br/>You've got two acting greats in Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman, which play their roles so admirably and naturally you'd swear they were born for these parts.<br/><br/>You've got Michael Curtiz, who, besides being an filming legend, went overboard in this film. He used, instead of his great actors, the scenes and shots themselves to move the plot along, a person watching wouldn't necessarily need to know the exact happenings of the entire plot to appreciate the scene - he uses diagetic off-screen sounds perfectly, and the frame always gives you the sense of exactly what's going on in a scene instantly, a rare feat in cinema that I may have seen once or twice prior to this.<br/><br/>And of course, there's the thematic overview of what's going on in Europe, at the release of this film swamped in the mire of World War II, this film provides an allegory for what the United States was doing up until that point - staying out of it until they were forced to act. The movie makes it look just as noble when Bogart stands up to the Nazis (this time taking place in a music vs. music overpowering scene), then when the United States actually invades Europe on D-Day.<br/><br/>Simply excellent."

People are doing what ever they can to escape and the town is about to implode. The story centers around a club owner, Rick, who has in his possession transit letter that offer a trip out of Casablanca.

","Before watching Casablanca I had a small idea what the movie was about but not truly sure of the whole movie. Once I watch it I liked it.<br/><br/>The plot is about a bar owner named Rick played by Humphrey Bogart who once live in New York City. After running from the Germans in France he ended up in Casablanca. Were he runs a bar that many powerful people come in to and business is talked about. Rick is kind of the leader if the mafia leader. People end up in Casablanca to try to get away back to in America. Many powerful people come in to place and try to get Rick to sit down and talk to them, but he never does till one day he hears a song that has not heard since France. This is doing to a long lost friend that he never thought he would anymore. Ilsa Ricks love in the movie is on here way to try to find a way to get out of Casablanca and back to New York. She just needs the help of Rick to do it.<br/><br/>This puts Rick in a hard spot. With all that is going on with Llsa and her friend Victor brings out the try style of him.<br/><br/>This movie uses a lot of music to build the mood and show you the mood. Its show the mood of the characters or scene that is taking place . Since the movie was in black and white there uses a lot of dark lighting or light lighting to show good or bad people. As well as misty or even love. For the 40's it is well done and can compare to today's movies. The made it looks like love. They love. Over all this is a great movie that draws you in from the begin to the end. You never really know what is going to be coming around the corner. You think you have a clue what is going to happened then it changes on you before think you figured it out. I know understand why this is an American classic and I would tell any more to watch it. If you wanted to know what kind of movie them it is I would say it's a suspenseful drama. Not a lot of action but still keeps you on drown in to the movie. If you're looking for a good movie to see I would say this is a good one to think about."

","In the beginning of the movie, the filmmaker attracts the audience by telling the story which is about the world war 2. However, I noticed something in the scene that the man who had expired passport tried to escape ,and he was shot, but the people around him did not be frightened or feel anything. After that, the story was focus on the bar, and there was the performing of music that was really fantastic. When the camera moved through the instrument or the singer, you would hear the sound of that thing was louder and louder. Besides, I think the vision of this movie is very clear; I can see many details on the background. Furthermore, the filmmaker added the story about the past; I think this is interesting way to tell a story and create the attention of the audience because the audience has to think what was going on, and this also fulfilled the love story perfectly."

","Casablanca was directed by Michael Curtiz and released in 1942. The film, starring Ingrid Bergan and Humphrey Bogart, is one of the all-time classic movies. The themes in Casablanca include love, loyalty and sacrifice. Ilsa is a married woman who learns that her husband has been killed in the war. She meets Rick in Paris, and the two fall in love. As they are about to leave Paris to avoid the Nazi's, she learns her husband is alive. Torn between her love for the two men, she learns that her husband needs her, and decides to remain loyal to him. However, she does not tell Rick, but just leaves instead, for she feared he would be not leave Paris and be captured. Time passes, and their paths cross again. This time, it is Rick that sacrifices his feelings for her, in an honorable and noble gesture. <br/><br/>The film is realistic in what happens in the storyline. During wartime, many men were said to have died, only to find out it was mistaken identity. For the time period the movie was filmed, Ilsa's decisions may have been very common. <br/><br/>The lighting and camera angles in some of the scenes, as well as some of the classic writing/quotes, has made the scenes memorable. The scene where Rick was in despair sitting in the dark, soft highlight lighting was used, making showing how distraught he was. This was the scene of his famous line, ""Of all the gin joints into the world, she walks into mine."" The final scene is one of the most famous scenes from a movie. It shows the love, the loss and sacrifice. The scene was shot with fog and dreariness. The playing of the theme song as the two interact the close-up shots with a soft focus of the camera add to the scene."

Even those who have not seen this film yet still know and have heard about it.<br/><br/>Casablanca is a film about love and war. This film was created just before world war II. During it there are some between the lines showing that Germany will lose the war, before they even knew who would win and lose. Which I personally believe to be as something very magnificent and special.<br/><br/>The acting in Casablanca was one to be unforgettable. Humphrey Bogart plays Richard 'Rick' Blaine and actress Ingrid Bergman plays Lisa Lund. Together they play wonderful roles.<br/><br/>The cinematography is something amazing. some of the best for its time. The lighting and camera long takes and zooming is awesome. Can't be better.

There are many scenes involving many people doing different things. For example one group of people is watching the band play, while at the same time they are other actor doing something.

","By the time I finally got around to watching Casablanca, only a few days before watching it again in one of my classes, I had already known so much about the movie, hearing it quoted millions of times, knowing the whole plot, and even what happens in the end, that I didn't even want to watch it anymore. But when it was on TV, I felt compelled to, and even though I was watching it a few days later, I am definitely glad that I did. The story is absolutely timeless, and it is something that could even happen nowadays. Bogart's Rick is still in love with Bergman's married Ilsa, who has come to Casablanca with her husband (Laszlo) so they they can escape to America, and away from the Nazi's who are after Laszlo. Throughout this time, Rick is torn between whether or not to help them escape, while wanting Ilsa all to himself. Bergman and Bogart both display such amazing acting skills, making the viewer really feel that they are in love. You can see Ilsa being torn between Laszlo and Rick and not knowing what to do as much as Rick doesn't know what to do. Aside from the story, the setting is really quite beautiful as well. The town of Casablanca, was just a really nice place to set the movie, and whenever anyone hears the name of the town, all people seem to think about is love."

","I have a poster of Casablanca on my wall because my fiancé has seen it and he made me put it up. I never thought that I would see the movie, but now that I have, I am glad. I thought that the lighting was outstanding. The use of the spotlights outside the windows gave it a suspenseful tone. The spotlight on Sam, the piano player, definitely made him stand out. The camera was very versatile, with close-ups and long shots combined in a very artistic and meaningful way. I noticed that the face of Bergman seemed almost perfect through the use of lighting as well. Rick was definitely the protagonist in the movie, but he was not a hero at all. He was mostly concerned about his own well-being throughout the entire movie. The antagonist in the movie was the Nazis. I enjoyed the fact that the movie touched on the fact that the Nazis were human beings as well. It showed the weaknesses that they have. I don't think I have ever seen a film in which the Nazis are portrayed in this way. I also noticed that there was a lot of sound in this movie. The piano was playing almost the entire time, there was singing, and there was humming. It really brought it all together and significantly contributed to the verisimilitude of the film."

","This film is definitely not overrated. I have never gotten the chance to see ""Casablanca"" since last week when I finally saw it. My mother constantly urges me to see it (she is a huge Humphrey Bogart fanatic). Rick Blaine's character is interesting. Rick is a cynic. He is very sharp and commonly snaps back with a witty one-liner. The cinematography in ""Casablanca"" is interesting. Ingrid Bergman plays Ilsa Lund. Ingrid is commonly shot from her left side. The Turner Classic Movie channel referred to her left said as her ""good side."" Shadows are used nicely in this film. The scene with Humphrey and Claude Rains (Captain Renault) utilized this. Bars of shadow often cover the faces of the actors to perhaps to insinuate imprisonment. The film also shows an interesting interpretation of pre-World War II. Casablanca is a basically neutral area at the time. People from all over the world end up in Rick's gin joint. I find it interesting to see how all of the people from nations at war react with each other interact in another part of the world. A great movie, overall."

I found the end incredibly disappointing; not that I feel it should be changed, its magnificent as is.

Some of the scenes in Rick's bar I had no idea what was going on and who wanted what because there were so many different uniforms walking around...

","Individuals are always dealing with war inside themselves. Whether it's a war between jealousy, self-centered behavior,neutrality,fear, or love, it's important for people to let go of those emotions and go for those feelings that are within your heart, even if it hurts you, or if you have contradicting feelings about someone or something. People can't always hide from their feelings. They have to go out into the world and release them to the person that an individual cares about.<br/><br/>Bogart's acting portrays all of these characteristics well in this movie. The entire acting in the movie was great and well timed. The romantic twists throughout the film were good,romantic, and very suspenseful as the viewers are glued into the interesting triangle between Rick,Ilsa, and Victor.The cinematography throughout the movie was good with a balance of soft lighting on the lead woman,bright, sharp focused contrast on the leading men as throughout the interior and exterior scenes, and the dark, gloomy, climatic clear contrast on Bogart's face was well shown to display his saddened angry mood at Ilsa's betrayal at the train station. The use of the piano, live bands, and recorded music was used well throughout the film. The use of depth of field was used well.<br/><br/>If you're interested in watching a romantic suspenseful drama, then this movie would be a great film to watch."

","This is such a classic movie. So many quotes that I have heard throughout my life I now know came from this film. I believe the overall message of this film was that you should do what is best for those you love even if you don't want to. Sometimes you have to be selfless. Since it was set in December of 1941 when Pearl Harbor was happening another over all message to the film was that America needs to join the war. This movie was such a similitude- I really believed in the movie and the characters. I felt the movie was heartfelt and certain parts I really felt like I could feel the characters feelings. The sound was wonderful. The scene where the plane was taking off in the beginning was great. As the plane rose over them on the porch you could hear the engine steady, the roar the higher the plane went. The protagonist in this film was Bogart. He was also the main character, you just felt him. Felt his pain, his sorrow, his love, and throughout the whole film the view was on his side. I noticed there was a lot of layering with the camera and the back round scenes. Some were very good and detailed and others you could tell the background was just a back drop that they altered in some way or another. This was a captivating movie. I believe the beautiful lighting had a lot to do with that. There were many parts in this film where there was low key lighting. Very few high key lighting scenes, but the low key made the movie that much more believable. I noticed, and i may be wring, but the only spots where there was a lot of high key lighting was when the theme song played. The lead woman in the film had very distinct lighting throughout the film. It was background lighting to soften her face. Over all I thought this was a good movie. It was quick paced, kept the viewer involved and interested in the film and the characters."

The final image is always illusion. Fruit of a cloudy afternoon or a broken friendship, heavy memories or only a indigestion. Color of bovaric touch and few tears. A love story with aristocratic perfume. Bogard, Bergman, a warm music and some popcorn. And than a pink sleep. The life is beautiful. The medicine is strong. And wars - shadows of a dead period.

I really do not know the reason other than maybe my approach to this film is that it is like visiting a relative who although I like lives many miles away. It will always be there unlike the relative though and that makes it even more special. This film grabs you very early but you need to pay attention because there are so many subtle facial changes of expression and body language movements that you can easily miss something. Like most of the great films it is timeless in that although it was made almost seventy years ago it can still captivate the viewer. It is a deceptively simple story but as always it gets complicated for all sorts of reasons. The film was of course made during the second world war but this has a series of emotional battle scenes and the whole experience is riveting and without doubt a masterpiece for all times."

","What else can I say about 'Casablanca' that hasn't already been said? Truth is, there isn't much; but there is a lot to be said about this movie, so I'm gonna give you my opinion on this legend of a film.<br/><br/>'Rick's Cafe Americain', 1941: War erupts throughout Europe and the US. Cynical bar owner Rick Blaine (Humphrey Bogart) will not help anyone in need of assistance: He ""sticks his neck out for nobody."" He is visited in his Cafe by a German trouble-causer by the name of Ugarte (Peter Lorre) who is on the run. Ugarte asks Rick to safeguard two letters of transit (or VISA's) to leave Morocco which have been reported as stolen. Rick holds these in the piano of his entertainer and good friend, Sam (Dooley Wilson).<br/><br/>Ugarte is tracked down and immediately killed by the authorities. Meanwhile, French resistance leader Victor Laszlo enters the bar with his lady, Ilsa Lund (Ingrid Bergman), Sam panics and hopes that Rick stays out of the way - knowing that it will only cause a fuss - Ilsa also knows this, but she desperately wants to see Rick, so she asks Sam to play 'As Time Goes By' (a song that Rick banned soon after his and Ilsa's break-up). Rick storms out of the back, he goes berserk; only to look up at Ilsa. He gives a shy smirk, and in that 5-10 second freeze the audience feels their pre-existing passion and love for each other as the camera switches from face to face.<br/><br/>Ultimately, the decision lies with Rick as to whether he takes the two VISA's for himself and Ilsa, or for Ilsa and Victor. His subsequent decision to leave himself in Morocco is a heartbreaking, but nevertheless honourable, one.<br/><br/>Everyone and their cat should know that 'Casablanca' is one of the most often spoofed/quoted movies in film history. Here are a few of them:<br/><br/>""Play it, Sam, play 'As Time Goes By'. You played it for her, now play it for me!""<br/><br/>""Round up the usual suspects.""<br/><br/>""Here's lookin' at you, kid.""<br/><br/>""We'll always have Paris. We didn't have, we got it back last night.""<br/><br/>""Louis, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship.""<br/><br/>(Rick) ""This gun is aimed directly at your heart."" (Captain Renault) ""Lucky for me, that is my least vulnerable spot.""<br/><br/>(Rick) ""I came to Casablanca for the waters."" (Captain Renault) ""The Waters? You're in the middle of a desert."" (Rick) ""I was misinformed.""<br/><br/>""I stick my neck out for nobody.""<br/><br/>""I'm the only cause I'm interested in.""<br/><br/>(Guest) ""What nationality are you, Rick?"" (Rick) "" ...I'm a drunkard."" (Captain Renault) ""That makes Rick a citizen of the world.""<br/><br/>...So now you see why this movie is a major motion picture classic? It sure does speak for itself. the 60-some years since it's release has brought some of the greatest cinematic minds lots of inspiration; and for this, we thank the makers of this wonderful film.<br/><br/>Excellent Film - *****"

","Firstly the plot. The story of Rick, a man who is ravaged by despair and regret running a bar in Casablanca, a city run by occupied France. Enter a resistance hero, Victor Laszlo, needing two letters of transit to escape to America to carry out a propaganda war against the Nazi's after fighting and resisting them as they marched through Europe unopposed. As Rick winds up with the letters and has fought for noble causes in the past it should be relatively easy to get out for the hero. But as the resistance fighter's escort is Rick's long lost love, Ilsa Lund, nothing is going to go smoothly. <br/><br/>Let's get one thing straight about this film, while the plot is fantastic, The cast do make it better. If you take some of the moments of bad dialogue in this movie and look at it on face value, then what you've got on paper is a contender for one of the hammiest films of all time, and sadly Ingrid Bergman gets landed with all of the crap lines.<br/><br/>However, the classic moments thankfully outweigh the bad ones, Peter Lorry and Bogies chat at the chess table and subsequent arrest ""I stick my neck out for nobody"" the superb moment with Captain Renault as Rick looks after the plane leaving with longing etched into every line on his face, the incredible scene at the roulette table which makes my stomach do somersaults every time I see it ""Have you tried 22?"" and my personal favourite, the underrated Victor Laszlo's impassive response when informed that the man that would save him and Ilsa has been killed in custody ""Is that all?"" is a great response when you consider what he has just heard.<br/><br/>Overall, for me, this is not in the league of ""The Big Sleep"" which matches Casablanca for classic moments and arguably has the better lines, but it still does not take away the fact that this is a classic, albeit a flawed one."

","I have to say ""Casablanca"" is a bit overrated. While displaying technical genius on many levels, the film has not aged too well. Maybe it blends in with other films of the era. It was entertaining, but I'd say pales in comparison to other classics from the golden age like ""The Treasure of the Sierra Madre,"" and ""The Maltese Falcon."" Unlike those two, ""Casablanca"" fails to deliver any deep message. There is no moral and there is nothing terribly memorable about the film. Well actually, there is Bogart...<br/><br/>Without him, I think ""Casablanca"" would have been pretty dull and forgettable. It just didn't grab the way I hoped it would.<br/><br/>This all being said, the story is fun, the humor is ripe, and the acting is superb. Technically speaking, a nine.

"nancy_the_bitch","8","0","4","18 February 2008"," General Comments on Casablanca
","I thought this film was good, but yet still it didn't live up to the hype that surrounds it. Everyone always writes about Casablanca with a romantic view, that it is one of the best 'Classic Hollywood' films made, yet I thought that at times it could be slightly slow and dull.<br/><br/>For example all the main action takes place in Rick's Café Américain, which modern viewers, especially the younger generations, will find odd and it can seem boring. As we are used to action packed films where the scenery changes every few minutes and this seems very theatrical as most plays are set in the one place and this has the consistent setting of the bar and the fact that the main part of the action takes place here, makes it seem rather monotonous. This was proved, by one of my friends at least, by the fact that she fell asleep during it.<br/><br/>There are also elements of historical inaccuracy, as looking back at the film now and knowing what we know about what happened in the concentration camps and Europe under Nazi rule, it seems that even if Lazlo had managed to escape from one of the concentration camps, he wouldn't have looked as healthy as he does in the film. This again goes back to the fact that as a younger viewer, I find that now actors are more likely to change their appearances for their film roles, even losing vast amounts of weight. For example, as Christian Bale lost weight for his role in 'The Machinist', yet Paul Henreid didn't lose the weight to look like a concentration camp survivor.<br/><br/>The film is often seen as one of the most romantic films for longer than the last half a century. The romantic content is unusual, in the sense that in modern films, the couple spend the entire film trying find the other, before finally getting together at the end of the film. However, in this film, the couple have already been together and spilt up before the film has even begun (although you do see this relationship in flashbacks). Another point that makes this aspect of the film unusual is that this couple are separated at the end, where Rick tells Ilsa that they cannot be together and that she would regret it ""for the rest of (her) life"" if she didn't leave with Lazlo. So, as the main couple don't get together at the end of the film, it is different to many of the modern 'greats' in the romantic genre.<br/><br/>However, overall apart from the differences between modern Hollywood films and Classic Hollywood films, making it, in my opinion, slightly dull at certain points during the film it was still much better than a lot of modern films."

","Casablanca (1942)<br/><br/>Number 1 - 1943 <br/><br/>Top 10 - 1940s <br/><br/>Perhaps the most loved American film of all time, if not, then definitely the most talked about film. Casablanca has been analysed, re-analysed and evaluated over and over again. No doubt this is a great film and one of the finest achievements of early cinema.<br/><br/>Featured in hundreds of top ten lists and reigning in the AFI's top 5 films of all time. I am not sure whether people have so much appreciation and respect towards this undisputed classic, or whether it is placed so highly out of sheer cinematic affection, love and respect towards its status. In my opinion 'Casablanca' is vastly overrated. While a great and often powerful film with great characters and old style over the top acting, I cannot see this film in the top 5 of all time. There are countless films I could mention that have a harsher, colder, funnier more powerful message and display it equally and better than 'Casablanca'.<br/><br/>'Casablanca' very much belongs to the old, glamorous times of Tinseltown a film that could have been the best at its time but not anymore - not in the modern order of cinema, where gritty, uncompromising pictures dominate the industry (along with a collection of other forgettable trash), where performances move and shatter human emotion. Anyway, it is unfair to somehow criticise the importance and quality of this film, because it is still an entertaining and very good film.<br/><br/>Humphrey Bogart plays Rick who owns the most successful joint in Casablanca, Morocco. 'Everyone comes to Rick's', corrupt officials, business men, locals - entertainment and gambling are at full force in Rick's place. Little note - Count the number of cigarettes that Bogart smokes during the film! A story of love, complex feelings, vivid characters under the shadow of war all in Casablanca. Watch it, enjoy it, cherish it. Casablanca is great and yes a masterpiece, but no way one of the top 10 or 20 films, but then again it is personal opinion that is what makes film so wonderfully beautiful.<br/><br/>9/10"

","I am staggered that it took me so long to finally get round to watching this movie! Casablanca has always been one of those movies that I've always wanted to see but never got around to it. Now that I have finally watched it, I am sure to be watching it again and again.

But let's just say that this movie is definitely a classic and you WILL watch it over and over again.<br/><br/>I do have one little gripe though - the movie is slightly tainted by the fact that there are German officers in it and it was made in 1942 - the height of World War II. So I got the feeling there was a little bit of blatant Allied propaganda put in there - the devious Germans and the heroic Resistance, that sort of thing. But saying that, the movie also portrayed the French Vichy regime in a kind of positive light, which I'm sure didn't go down too well with the Free French.<br/><br/>But these are just minor points. On the whole, this is an excellent and timeless piece of film-making!<br/><br/>Play it again Sam!"

","""Casablanca"" (1942) made by Michael Curtiz is something like a romantic preview of a nothing to do waiting for a failed encounter in flashback, because a lady didn't came when the town was almost surrounded just after he was searched by enemies. An action movie as ""Casablanca"" is still like a labyrinth in the confused story told by this B picture, within a mythic atmosphere behind the history itself as too surcharged by a post-colonial era cult now. The comic scene for instance - like one of the countless - that is one of the best of this movie, as while it is pretext for describing on the local market a tent with the bargained artifact seeming a trousseau, whose price is reduced almost for less than a half since the short beginning of the purchase, but which never occurs because the lady doesn't want it. <br/><br/>Meanwhile Rick comes at her across the tents, nevertheless the local trader is still insisting for selling it, because he knows him and his reputation as a kind of protector - in such a matter, as business as usual, like an expert of the town - also it is of course of a great value, from the colonial folk state of moving facts under the rule of the Casbah and like it occurs also in any black market of the kind, as too for the traditional searching of the lost documents, for buying the tickets further going away from this purgatory. Mrs. Ferrara is the real mastermind of the alternative power in the Casbash mystery way of living, an acculturated Italian with a store with coffee-shop rivalizing by day with the night-club of Rick concerning searching a way to go away from this land and having always in his hands a kick-flies to close each time his interventions as if human beings in transit were less important than immediate sanity around him because the heat, backgrounded maybe by his past in Tunis by his local hat and way of talking from a fat man with a dangerous and quite hypnotical smile, whose to make common affairs with Rick leave Rick cool in a quick ambiguous answer for another next meeting. <br/><br/>Back in the middle of the movie, there is a set nicknamed the Rick's Américain Café, a kind of store for foreigners and else station bar, where the brothers Epstein and Koch improvised in a daily basis the story lines, as in the studio itself during the shootings for the next scene. That never happens after the plane take-off and the unusual suspects are spelled since then, when someone like a dull with uniform as in the flux of events said ""round up all the usual suspects"" and finishing it after the noise of the Dakota plane going slowly far away. Even the bottle of mineral water open by the French police officer, after the customs and hangar zone outside where the telephone is with the German corpse nearby, but not at all drink to the bottom because we saw only one or two swallows by the mustache that thrown it one quarter empty with a chock on the box near the ground without broken it as resistant it was the kind of glass of this Vichy it seems to him by chance."

It was this movie by the way that cemented Humphrey Bogart's fame as a maverick Hollywood icon and in the history of motion pictures itself.<br/><br/>""Casablanca"": Is there any other movie more Americans can agree on? In one perspective,you'll always find dissenters with ""Citizen Kane"", ""Gone With The Wind"",""The Wizard Of Oz"",and even other films like ""It's A Wonderful Life"",""The Best Years Of Our Lives"",not to mention two other Humphrey Bogart classics like ""Key Largo"",and also ""The African Queen"",not to mention the other Hollywood epics of their day. Somehow for those who have never seen ""Casablanca"",or those who have never heard of Humphrey Bogart or for that manner his co-star Ingrid Bergman,not only love the movie,but love it more as--what's the phrase--as time goes by. Do not experience this movie on either Video or for that manner DVD or for other reasons do not see this on television either. The best way to experience this Humphrey Bogart masterpiece is on a projected screen in a movie house with a capacity audience. It was meant to be seen on the big screen. It sometimes plays in selected art-houses where it shown as a part of a midnight screenings,or as part of selected screenings at some prestigious colleges and universities.<br/><br/>""Casablanca"",was one of the top grossing films of 1942,and was the winner of three academy awards including Best Picture,Best Director and Best Screenplay,and it is Number 2,after Orson Welles'""Citizen Kane"",on the American Film Institute's list of the greatest movies of all time. ""Casablanca"" has achieved an iconic status way out of proportions to its celluloid scale:a wartime melodrama(that takes place in the Middle East,since this movie was released at the height of World War II),at a running time of 102 minutes long,and was made for less than one million dollars on a essentially one set.<br/><br/>Those famous lines!(""Here's looking at you,kid."") Those stars! (Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman at their most magnificent and their most magnetic.)That style!(Trench coats on a airfield tarmac.) That song! Will always go down in music history(""You must remember this,a kiss is still a kiss,a sigh is just a sigh.........."" Basically,you know the rest of it.<br/><br/>It was a perfect product of the Hollywood factory at its golden peak during the early 1940's and in the midst of World War II. A film that was brilliantly cast,with skill and dignity and it shows in some of the most memorable of all characters. This was a film that came from the golden-age of the talent pool from the studios of Warner Bors. Pictures. This was when Warner Bors. was a pioneering force in Hollywood and a major perennial powerhouse. ""Casablanca"" is not only the best film to come out of a major Hollywood studio,but also to point out it is a work of art and sheer genius. A melodrama-adventure spectacle that is flawlessly directed(by Michael Curtiz),subtly played,and excellent performances throughout. It is a cinematic classic to behold. See it sometime at a nearby theater. Do not catch this film on neither video or playing on television. Experience it at the movies."

","The film revolves around the lives of WWII refugees who use Casablanca as means of getting out of war torn Europe and into the United States. Humphrey Bogart is excellent as the cafe owner Rick and Ingrid Bergman superb as Ilsa, Rick's old lover who abandoned him in Paris without explanation, and then shows up in Casablanca with her husband. The script is well written and the dialogue flows effortlessly and believably between characters. Ingrid Bergman brings a fantastic amount of complexity to her character's emotions and the mystery surrounding her true feelings for Rick is smartly never fully resolved. Even when Ilsa claims she thought her husband was dead and that's why she had an romance with Rick, I'm not sure I believe her. Ilsa, whether its out of guilt or love, desperately wants to get her husband Victor Laszlo out of Casblanca and on his way to the USA. The Germans are trying to keep Laszlo in Casablanca indefinitely due to his anti-war activities. Claude Rains as Captain Renault is wonderful and leaves a indelible mark in cinema history for his witty retorts throughout the film. The movie was the birth of the often repeated movie lines ""here's looking at you kid"" and ""this looks like the start of a beautiful friendship."" I highly recommend this film."

","Casablanca is appealing to me, for only a few reasons, one being the setting. The fact that is takes place in still-unoccupied France gives it a sense of danger, letting the viewer know people are going to Casablanca to get away from the war. The love story is amazing and classic, and this is coming from a guy that doesn't like romantic movies. Ingrid Bergman as Ilsa is beautiful in this movie, and it's not hard to see why Rick fell for her so hard. The music-especially a certain song-you know what I'm talking about-is still a classic. This is possibly Humphrey Bogart's most well-known role, and only a cynic couldn't see why. And the final reason, this movie has some of the most famous quotes in movie history. Just look them up and you'll see what I mean. <br/><br/>It's a shame more people my age can't appreciate great movies like this anymore. This movie has stood the test of time perfectly, and it will continue to do so throughout the years."

","The one you love is already taken. The people who need help can't get it. The country you love is thousands of miles away. The only person you can trust is yourself. The only way out is through bribes and lies. This just a typical scenario for Casablanca.<br/><br/>In Nazi oppressed Casablanca, everyday could be your last. Your life isn't safe as long as you have enough money. For Rick Blaine, Casablanca is as far away from home and his past that he can get. Troubled by a lost love, Rick has become the owner of a night club. With the help of his friend Captain Renault, his business of drinking, entertainment, and illegal gambling make Rick's the place to be. His life long friend and piano player Sam is with him until the end. What seems like a decent existence in the desert is about to be thrown into a whirlwind of trouble.<br/><br/>One evening at Rick's, a distinguished guest arrives. It is the leader of the underground Resistance, Victor Laszlo. He and his companion arrive shortly after one of Laszlo's comrades, Ugarte, is captured and killed. Rick has no intention of helping Laszlo and his underground movement until he meets his wife Ilsa. When their eyes meet, it is as if a freight train has ran right through Rick. The one thing he has been hiding from has found him. The woman that left him alone on that platform in Paris after the Nazi invasion is back.<br/><br/>His only solution is to start drinking, but drowning his sorrows solves nothing. After the first night, Rick must make a decision. Does he give up Laszlo to the authorities or aid him in escaping the Nazis? Rather than halting all illegal activities that make Rick's the place to be, it is business as usual. Giving Laszlo the information he needs would help win the war. It would also mean giving up the only woman he would die for. Now the weight of the war rests on Rick's shoulders, as well as his heart.<br/><br/>This is not just a love story, Casablanca has everything. It has action, comedy, thrills, as well as romance. The background is the second world war, but the story could have taken place earlier, later, or even today. The Epstein brother's winning screenplay cannot be compared to anything of its generation or future generations for that matter. The flow of conversation goes back and forth like it would in real life Casablanca. Witty remarks, memorable lines, and dialogue that would be considered ""cliche"" today are ""cliche"" because films of this archetype copy Casablanca in so many ways.<br/><br/>Where would Casablanca be without its cast? The film, although virtually flawless, is illuminated by its fantastic actors. Humphrey Bogart, with his charisma and overwhelmingly powerful screen presence, stars as Rick, the lost soul. His lover Ilsa, portrayed lovely by Ingrid Bergman, doesn't know what is right anymore. Claude Rains as Captain Renault tries to make a living off of the illegal activities at Rick's. Ilsa's husband Lazslo, Paul Henried, is ever defiant of the Nazi oppression, after surviving one of their concentration camps. His cause is stronger than ever. Thorwn together, this ensemble, accompanied by some nice appearances by Peter Lorre, Sydney Greenstreet, and Conrad Veidt, cultivate a story that is fueled by desires and overflowing with energy.<br/><br/>Casablanca has been captivating audiences around the world for decades. It can only be assumed that director Michael Curtiz and his team of writers figured out how to make a film. All the pieces fit to get this picture churning. From the opening frame to those last lines by Bogart ensure that this will not be the last time you see Casablanca. The film will only keep growing stronger through the years. As new generations of filmmakers are born, there are a select number of films that can inspire. Casablanca certainly ranks high on the list."

","It is a fact that Casablanca is one of the greatest films of all time. You can see it all around you. It has inspired remakes, and sequels. It has been turned into a Warner Brothers cartoon, it has been quoted and misquoted in countless books and films, commercials and ""lists."" I am willing to go as far as saying that there is not a person in the United States that has not either heard, quoted, or seen a scene from this film,. Whether it be the timeless, ""Here's lookin' at you kid"", or ""Louie I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship"" scene. We have all heard itthe question to ask is why has this film stayed on our screens and in out hearts.<br/><br/>The answer is believe lies in two places, the first is the acting. Humphry Bogart and Ingrid Bergman are truly legends in Cinema. There faces and careers are known to all, they were part or Hollywoods Golden age and forever will remain there frozen for all time, and that without a doubt helped the popularity of the movie. But more than that is their chemistry, which is reflected whenever they are together on the screen. When Rick takes Ilsa at the end and tells her that should she choose not to go with Victor on that plane, she will regret it, that maybe it will not be today or tomorrow but soon, and it will be with her for the rest of her life. In that moment you see some amazing acting by two truly great actors. You feel the bond and love between them, and the realization that despite that they must do what they have to. A moment like that is so rare and in my opinion audiences realize that.<br/><br/>The second reason I think the film has endured is that it deals with a complex story, or stories rather, all wound together in this time period that truly shook the world (World War II). At the start of the film you see Rick and Ilsa, two lovers that while in Paris are broken apart. The scene then moves forward, Rick is now closed, interred within himself, heartbroken. Then his story is met with Peter Lorrie's which involve the letters of transit. Once he dies, the two become one. The movie then progresses and we meet Ilsa again, changed by the same heartbreak that affected Rick but who at the same time has become part of something great and moved on. At the same time Victor comes in, and his work with the underground resistance. As times goes by (no pun intended) another story is added, which lies directly between the coming together (again) of Rick and Ilsa. That in turn binds all of these tales together. Buried inside this is the stories of Sam, Rick's buddy, and Captain Renault the Chief of Police. Then you have the internal conflicts, Ilsa doesn't know what she wants, Victor is steadfast in his beliefs, Rick knows what he wants but is confronted with what must be done. This multitude of characters (the casting of which as stated was truly perfect) and stories allows everyone who watches it to relate. An whenever a film presents that option it is destined to succeed.<br/><br/>Granted all this is my personal opinion, but the simple truth is Casablanca has proved itself. I mean seriously when you have a phrase attached to a film like ""Whoever you watch Casablanca with is the person you will marry"" you know the movie has really succeed. I guess all I can say is give it a chance, sit down and let the magic that is this film wash over you."

","As a 1980's generation movie fan, I haven't got my sense of ""classic"" until I see this one. The whole story is very touching, and all the cast have given shining performances to the audience. When you see Rick's frown, you will be able to tell how much pain he suffered and concealed in the deep heart while you don't know whether he will return to the ""bright side"" or not. All the other actors also done quite well. They may amuse you in a serious way or in a comic way--that is to be discovered by yourself. As time goes by, the song AS Time Goes By has occupied a part of American culture or even a part of the whole world's culture. I have heard it in a couple of advertisements or in the beginning of a TV programme. That was before watching the film. However, it is always like a warm stream running out of my heart each time I hear the song, after I saw it. Everybody has something within, which is extremely unique, precious and beautiful. No matter how many years have past, we can still remember it as something shining. That is the emotion held by Rick and other two main characters in the ""crazy world"" of WW2, as individuals, as human.<br/><br/>Most people defined it as ""perfact"", while I think it could be better if the ending is not so dramatic and comfort and ""with everyone satisfied"". Rick has chosen to fight again for the bright side, maybe for the last time. So he deserved the very punishment that Nazis would give. So Rick could have turned away after the plane's taking off, leaving his fate to audience to guess.If the movie had gone in this way, I could have been even more satisfied because I am quite realistic. However, it is actually made during the war and people need more hope as Rick needed, as time needed. I am also not supposed to question the origin arrangement......<br/><br/>My rating is 9/10"

The only criticism that might make any sense at all would be that when compared with modern films, it doesn't have great special effects. But then, it's not a ""special effects"" picture, and the cardboard cutout airplane with midgets working on it was a stroke of genius in itself.<br/><br/>The story of the making of the movie that appears on the DVD is very interesting- the plot evolving during the shooting, writers coming and going and coming back again, the last minute (and beyond) work on the ending.<br/><br/>The cast is outstanding, the sets are perfect, everything about this timeless classic works. Watching this film, to me, is an almost religious experience into the capabilities of the human species to use fiction to show the best and worst that we humans can be.

","Casablanca is one of those films that have been mentioned so often that I have became extremely curious about it. I had extremely high expectations for this film  maybe because this film deserves such high expectations from younger audiences. Casablanca is about Rick (Humphrey Bogart), a nightclub owner who is a lonely man and has a life filled with one-night stands and glasses of wine. He does not want to be attached to anything personally or politically, but he has receive hold of two transit letters. Victor Laszlo (Paul Henreid), who is a Czech nationalist writer and his wife, Ilsa (Ingrid Bergman) has come to Rick's in search of exit visas because on their way to America, they must arrive at Casablanca first, and visas are hard to come by. Surprisingly, Rick and Ilsa were former lovers who met in Paris, and Ilsa was also the only woman Rick has ever loved. Their relationship ended when Rick flees the city from German armies and the plan was that they leave together. When Ilsa did not come to the train station, Rick left without Ilsa and hasn't seen her since. Rick is both angry and frustrated when he sees Ilsa, but he finds out that he still really loves her and might be also willing to help her and her husband.<br/><br/>One of the great things about Casablanca is that it has a great story, rich in detail and is nicely done. This is why it is often cited as one of the Best Films Ever Made. Not only that is flourishes with romance but, it transforms into a worthy epic that moves quickly along the plot. As we watch the film, we find that Rick and Ilsa still love each other very much and are perfect for each other, but the two searches for the right thing to do, which is probably the hardest thing for both of them to do. They must leave each other because that is what is best for them.<br/><br/>The problem in this film is that everything happens quickly. (Yes, I complain about Lost in Translation being too slow but now I'm complaining that Casablanca is too quick  how the heck can people please me?) This is one of the films that I wished that just went a little longer and maybe  just maybe  I would be pleased. I also wished the plot delve deeper into the characters because apparently, the flashback scene of Rick and Ilsa wasn't enough for me. I wished the story explored the characters a bit more, but of course, I think Ingrid Bergman's drop of tear coming from the edge of her eyes is quite enough for the film.<br/><br/>The performances are really good. I don't think any modern movie stars can really compete with Bogart and Bergman. They are fantastic together. There is also Henreid, who has terrific scenes in the film. Conrad Veidt, who plays Strasser whose only goal is to capture Laszlo and is far more than the typical Nazi villain. Claude Rains plays Louis, who has always secured his and Rick's friendship (""Louis, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship.""). There is of course, Dooley Wilson, who played Sam and I think one of my favorite songs of all time has to be ""As Time Goes By."" I really enjoyed this film. I don't love it as much as I thought I would, but I really enjoyed it. Casablanca is often compared to Gone with the Wind and unfortunately, I think I still like Gone with the Wind a lot better. Casablanca is gorgeous for a black-and-white film. (But face it, all black-and-white films are gorgeous.) The ending closes with some promise of a world of less regrets, but more memories. It is nice to know that Rick and Ilsa will always have Paris and Casablanca."

","The reason that this movie lists as my most favorite movie is that ""Rick"" is very much like a real person: a little cynical, rather practical, and even a tiny bit ""the romantic"". And despite his identification as a jaded and possibly bitter person from a past relationship, he does the one thing that I hope I, and more people, can do someday. He shows that true love is unselfish.<br/><br/>I certainly do not expect everyone to appreciate my singular view of this movie. But I believe the things we take from a movie (besides the aesthetics) are the ideas and images it presents to its viewers. These are the things we compare and contrast in our own lives."

","""Casablanca"" is a film that came out in 1942--a time of war and uncertainty. Nobody knew who was going to win the big one, and I believe that is the reason ""Casablanca"" became so popular and has remained so popular ever since. This film is about sacrifice--about doing the right thing even if it is at the expense of one's own happiness. ""Casablanca"" takes place in Morocco towards the beginning of WWII. At this time the Nazis had captured France, but Morocco, a French colony, was still considered to be free; however, Nazi influence over the nation was growing ever more. In fact, it could easily be said that Morocco had become a Nazi puppet nation. It is in this atmosphere that we meet Rick (Bogart in his greatest role), a cynical night club owner who doesn't give a damn about anyone or anything. We soon learn that his miserable outlook on life was caused by a woman named Ilsa (played brilliantly by Bergman) who had jaded him long ago. It is here in Casablanca that Rick plans on spending the rest of his days in isolation--his love of life has been sucked right out of him. However, Rick's world soon comes crashing down when Ilsa comes walking into his ""gin joint"" with her husband Victor (Paul Henreid). Victor is a part of the French Underground and is on the run from the Nazis; his escape route led him directly to Casablanca where he is now searching for two visas to America: one for him and one for Ilsa. In an ironic twist of fate, Rick happens to come across two visas when a friend of his, played by Peter Lorre, gives them to him to hide. Lorre's character was supposed to sell these very visas to Victor and Ilsa, and had arranged for a meeting at Rick's bar. Unfortunately, Lorre's character is arrested and thus Rick gets the visas. However Rick does not realize that these visas are for Ilsa and her husband, and Ilsa does not realize that the bar belongs to Rick, so when they meet it is by complete chance. Soon enough, Victor and Ilsa learn that it is Rick who has the visas and thus they try to persuade him to sell the visas to them. Rick is still bitter about being jaded by Ilsa long ago and therefore refuses to give them any such pleasure--Rick wants revenge. However Ilsa plans to persuade Rick, and in doing so she falls back in love with him--she is prepared to leave Victor for Rick, so long as Rick agrees to give Victor the visa. Rick agrees to the terms, and we soon have an uneasy feeling about the whole situation. This good man, Victor, may be getting a visa, but he is loosing a wife, and we know from Rick's experience that when people suddenly loose lovers they also loose their interest in life, and Victor cannot afford to give up his fight against the Nazis. It is here we see Rick's true character shine through all the cynicism; he engineers a plot that ensures that both Victor AND Ilsa get on that plane to America. Rick not only gives up any chance of getting out of Casablanca, but he also gives up Ilsa so that Victor may have her and that the both of them may continue their valiant underground fight against the Nazis. Rick also realizes that Casablanca has become too dangerous a place for Ilsa, and at the same time too dangerous a place for him as he is going to be punished for helping Victor, who is an enemy of the Nazis. Rick is prepared to sacrifice everything for a cause larger than himself, and that is why this film was so appropriate for the time in which it was made. ""Casablanca"" reminded America that they were now in a war and that sacrifice was going to be necessary of everyone--even those who wanted nothing to do with the world. Rick is the kind of person that we should all regard as a hero, for he puts aside his bitterness and even his own happiness for the sake of something vastly more important. Rick ensures that one of the underground movement's most valuable figures escapes the Nazis grip. However, Rick needed some inspiration in order to perform this valiant act. I believe that he was inspired by Victor, and came to realize that this man was an incredible human being. I also believe that Rick comes to realize that true love is doing what is best for a person, and not what is best for one's self, and thus he gives Ilsa up in order to ensure her safety. Rick was inspired by both patriotism and his devout love to Ilsa. Although Rick's actions may have been the result of some inspiration, they too would come to affect someone else: the chief of the French police in Casablanca (played wonderfully by Claude Rains). Here is a man who hates the Nazis but obeys their commands because it is in his best interest. However, when Claude's character sees the valiant actions of Rick, he too decides to denounce the Nazis. Besides the wonderful message and a host of intriguing characters such as Rick, ""Casablanca"" offers so much more: wonderful lighting, cinematography and acting, suspense, drama, romance, and some of the best lines ever written. Even the end of the movie is more than just a message; it also leaves us with a bitter-sweet taste, as Rick receives nothing and gives up everything. As stated, this was the kind of sacrificial attitude needed during WWII, and it is an attitude that continues to ring loud and clear throughout all desperate times. ""Casablanca"" deserves and receives: 5 out of 5 stars.<br/><br/>Copyright 2006 Imaginist"

","Round up the usual suspects! This account of the profound ambiguity at the heart of the universe grabs us dramatically, and then keeps on turning the kaleidoscope through which we see Rick and the other characters, as well as the socio-political, geopolitical, and historical context. Rick is among those blessed ones who finally make the right choice against all the odds. (But just why did he act rightly? What makes his choice the right one?) Do consequences make an action correct? Do motivations? Do both? What other aspects of person, situation, choice, decision, action, and context make an action good? Incidentally, this film brought me to my feet for the Marseillase with tears in my eyes. Usually, remembering how the French Revolution so quickly became a tyranny, and how France welcomed the invaders in the War Against the Jews, my attitude toward France, no matter how much I honor her thinkers, is lukewarm at best.

","The film that made Bogart a major star is not what I expected the first time i saw it. After seeing him in the Maltese Falcon which I thought was a brilliant film I decided to give this a try, although I am not really into romantic films as this certainly is. The love story is truly one of the more memorable ones but it would have been contrived without the war time setting. Everything the characters do may have long lasting effects on their lives or in some cases may even claim their lives. The Rick character, who is supposed to be completely neutral, can't escape being an accomplice in what the Laszlo character is deeply involved in. It's not only because he loves Ilsa (Bergman) but you can see that he hates the Germans as much as anybody when he first meets Major Strasser. That aside the Bogart character would never send a decent man to his doom as Laszlo essentially is, even though he is a rather cold hearted bore.<br/><br/>The film could have done without the Renault character, who is simply there to make commentary about Bogart's character. Will he or will he not sacrifice Laszlo or his lady love? The comic relief is minor and I suspect that even people who love the film will find anything novel in Rains' appearance.<br/><br/>Then finally there is Bergman. Except for being beautiful she must have had some other qualities as well and that is extremely underused in this film. To see her crying every five minutes is not what you would expect a modern woman character to do and indeed her character is simply a hanger-on and besides being the object of affection for both Rick and Laszlo she is supposed to stay in her place.<br/><br/>The whole film can be described as being more entertainment than of actual historical importance and on that level it delivers but it is still funny to think that it was being made at a time when the whole world could have been crushed by the forces of evil and that this could have very well been the last time you would ever see a movie that criticised Nazism."

","Look no further than some of the memorable quotes listed here to begin to understand why this film is so beloved. At 60+ years of age the dialog is still a thing of beauty - quick, funny, cutting. Rick casually cuts down important figures of the community with the briefest of comments. Watching this movie today you are instantly reminded of other modern classics, but then you have to know that this one launched them all. The dialog of Pulp Fiction - comedic banter about topics ranging from foot rubs to french cheese burgers are interspersed with scenes of high drama - how different is it here when you are looking at the possible collapse of a city at the hands of the Nazi's in the midst of WWII. <br/><br/>Rick: Your cash is good at the bar. Banker: What? Do you know who I am? Rick: I do. You're lucky the bar's open to you. <br/><br/>Woman: What makes saloon keepers so snobbish? Banker: Perhaps if you told him I ran the second largest banking house in Amsterdam. Carl: Second largest? That wouldn't impress Rick. The leading banker in Amsterdam is now the pastry chef in our kitchen. <br/><br/>Concepts of ""rounding up the usual suspects"", ""of all the gin joints"", ""This is the beginning of a beautiful friendship"" have been parodied, stolen re-used and homaged in many good films since. <br/><br/>This film was mad during the height of WWII - it is not a look back at the Nazi horrors - it takes on the Nazi's head on. The scene where they sing the French national song is terribly moving in 2005 - imagine what it would have been like in 1942.<br/><br/>Watch the film again and think of how many films it reminds you of and realize that this was the film that helped make those others possible."

","I absolutely agree with user kdyran. This is a Classic, a Masterpiece. This is what real acting and real film making is about. Casablanca is, in my mind, the pinnacle of American cinema. It is rather depressing to go from Casablanca and look at what is coming out in theaters now-American cinema has really declined in quality since the age of Casablanca. Perhaps this is because the film industry was just starting out, and money could only be devoted to movies and ideas that really deserved it. Today, the film industry is so huge that even the trashiest films get funding and viewer time. The American Moviewatching Association ranks Casablanca #1 or 2 as the best American movie ever made, trading places every so often with Citizen Kane (another great classic). If you don't like Casablanca, either there is something really wrong in your head, or you have absolutely no taste. What a fantastic film!"
"rowmorg","Null","0","3","1 July 2005"," On which hit list does Casablanca belong?
","The world's Number One movie, shown almost nightly on US cable TV, stands wildly at odds with current US policy.<br/><br/>Casablanca was greeted by fanfares and eulogies when it was launched in 1942, and it has been praised to the skies ever since, with all the fat movie encyclopedias rating it either Number One, or in the top five movies of all time.<br/><br/>How are we to view this picture now, as it gets played almost nightly on the US/Canada cable TV channels, and as the US war machine goes pointlessly berserk in Iraq, commanded by a man of no known military worth? Firstly, Casablanca was about the absurdity of standing aside in World War Two, which is exactly what the USA was doing when the film was prepared and made. The film's schizophrenic hero, Rick/Richard, is profoundly corrupted by his offshore, semi-detached posture (read: American neutrality), which contrasts sharply with his previous committed left-wing adventures (read: the New Deal).<br/><br/>His bitter non-involvement has been induced during the panic of the invasion of France, when instead of joining the resistance he had a rash fling with an emigree half his age. He was happy to stick his neck into her, but after the coitus getting interruptus, he is holed up in a huff in Morocco, no longer willing to stick his neck into politics.<br/><br/>Our heroine is no less corrupted by detachment, because it was her husband's absence, locked up in some concentration camp, that led to the affair, his instruction to keep the marriage a secret for her own security that led to the consummation, and his being holed up outside Paris after escaping, that led her to go to his side, thereby abandoning ""Richard"".<br/><br/>In addition to the unhitched position of the two leading characters, the ending of Casablanca further drives home the message that Rick/Richard is not willing to commit, either to Ilsa or the war, as he slips away with the cock-hatted Casablanca police chief to a safe hole in Brazzaville where they can drink themselves to death. Even Ilsa and Viktor are heading into exile in brightly-lit New York.<br/><br/>So, America's favourite film is all about neutrality and not sticking your neck into other peoples' wars, although you are willing to give a leg up to the good guys as long as it does not cost you. This is bizarrely at odds with the USA's current imperialistic posture of pre-emptive war and proactive engagement overseas. Why does Casablanca still play so big on all channels? The only positive character fully engaged in the war, Viktor Laszlo, is a loving husband and practising idealist, but he is also an insurgent leader bent on bringing down the occupying authorities across Europe. Today, Laszlo's face would be on one of the USA's notorious hit-list playing-cards. He would probably have $25m on his head, offering the Ricks of this world a fabulous opportunity for sour treachery.<br/><br/>Second, Casablanca has at its heart a major investment in wild and fulfilling extramarital sex. This is hardly a topic that promises to bewitch Jesusland and the Monica baiters.<br/><br/>With many marriages broken by war, such overwrought romances were reportedly widespread, but the scriptwriters carefully contrived Ilsa's position so that she was as guilt-free as possible while parting her legs and allowing intro-mission. Mitigating circumstance: the husband had been removed by force majeure for the best part of a year, time enough for the loinal urges awakened by a happy wedding night to make their legitimate physical demands on the wife.<br/><br/>Furthermore, Paris was about to fall, an in-extremis situation tailor-made for frantic fornicating all round. Plus Richard, dressed by matrimonially-inclined wardrobe for a wedding, is another idealist who has smuggled arms to Ethiopia (against the Mussoliniites there) and fought with the Loyalists in Spain. Why, he probably drinks with Picasso in Pigalle, where the lovebirds are shown swilling bubbly. Above all, Richard's subservient comrade is an African American jazz musician in whom Ilsa has a fall-back position that hints at yet darker urges.<br/><br/>Interracial sex, seduction, fornication, pornography (""Here's looking at ya, babe!""), the only sins overtly missing here are buggery and abortion but we feel that, with his underground contacts, Richard/Rick would have no problem procuring either.<br/><br/>Does this seething id-nest at the heart of the film prevent it from being family entertainment? Of course not, because Rick heartily endorses marriage in the denouement, when he tricks the police at gunpoint into allowing that marriage of political and sexual ideals, Viktor and Ilsa, on to a plane to Lisbon.<br/><br/>But this sudden lapse into huge decency has a hidden motive. With the marrieds out of the picture, Rick is free to head off into a Buddy-bonding road movie with the chief of police, far from all wars, preemptive or otherwise. Instead of imposing freedom, these two rogues would rather practise it.<br/><br/>It's high time the pundits of America's corporate media removed Casablanca from the Top Five and put it on the hit list instead."

","Ah, ""Casablanca."" Is there a line from the film that hasn't become a cliché? That's not a criticism of the movie. If anything it's the reverse. What greater compliment to a film screenplay can a film audience make than so completely absorbing every word of it into its common cultural consciousness? It took me a long time and multiple viewings before I warmed up to Michael Curtiz's 1943 film (by some accounts a 1942 release). I'm not particularly a fan of either Ingrid Bergman or Humphrey Bogart, and the film-making techniques didn't strike me as anything inventive or unique and they still don't. At best, ""Casablanca"" exists as an example of the classic Hollywood style of film-making working at its slickest and most polished.<br/><br/>But then on about the fourth viewing, it struck me. The people who love this movie don't love it for the striking visuals or the daring narrative or any of the elements that make, say, ""Citizen Kane"" such continual fuel for film discussion. People still love ""Casablanca"" for coming out at exactly the right moment in our cultural history, and somehow it's retained that ""right place, right time"" allure. America had been involved in World War II for at least two years by the time of this film's wide release, and many women had seen their men leave to face uncertain futures. So no wonder a film with such an intense nostalgic glow about it would strike a universal chord. No wonder the forbidden romance between the Bergman and Bogart characters seemed so intensely poignant. And no wonder the patriotic, ""do whatever you must for the good of the cause"" propaganda (for let's call it what it is), seemed so stirring (and still does).<br/><br/>Is ""Casablanca"" a great film? I won't attempt to answer that, though it's not one of my personal favorites. But any film that carries its legacy with it the way this one does can't be completely dismissed either.<br/><br/>My grade: B+"

The film's issues and themes are very much on the surface, and one is able to notice how poorly some of the characters are constructed when it is known already what is to happen on a second viewing.

","Casablanca, does it reflect society or does society reflect this little hole in the wall resort? When watching the movie, one can't help but notice all the lines that just seem so cliché and yet fit so well into the story; is it because the coolest cat of them all (Humphrey Bogart) is delivering them? Is it because this movie is completely satirical in nature so it just adds humor to the plot? Or is it because the clichés we hear everyday have come from this movie all 10 + of them. <br/><br/>Maybe not so much reason number 2 but definitely reason 3 and perhaps a little of number 1. Humphrey Bogart is THE definition of 'cool'; literally, look it up in the dictionary and his picture will be there. So when this swanky, hip guy says 'Here's lookin' at you kid' for the umpteenth time, it's acceptable because it's Bogey, and what Bogey does is cool, never overdone. <br/><br/>This movie is set during WWII and is about a leader from the underground movement (Victor Laszlo played by Paul Henreid), his wife (Ilsa Lund Laszlo played by Ingrid Bergman) and the owner of a little café, (Rick Blaine played by Humphrey Bogart). It is about when they have a chance meeting in Morocco, some for a first introduction and others for a surprise reunion. Of course, there is a lovely flashback set to the lovers' song and the story of what happened years ago and how things have ended up the way they are becomes clear. As a 15 year-old freshmen this movie wasn't enjoyable, but 3 years later this movie is absolutely adorable and very much recommended as a 'must-see'. Berlin and Bogart has such chemistry and the story has such an interesting twist, it's hard to accept but at the same time that's how things must be. It leaves you with a sense of completion but at the same time uneasy because there are other possibilities that will never be fulfilled. 3 weeks later, the lost dreams are still irritating to this reviewer. <br/><br/>American society is defiantly portrayed in this film, Humphrey plays a café owner that, 9 times out of 10, is doing something for his own benefit, but then he does something to help someone else and it just seems to completely mask the 'bad' things he may have done. For example, there is gambling going on in Rick's Café; there is a roulette wheel, in fact, a fixed one. This wheel is fixed so that Rick is getting more returns back and it isn't a fair game of chance. But then a woman in a desperate situation with a genuine need for money to save herself, her husband, and their marriage comes along and Rick gets soft. He then discreetly tells the woman's husband the winning slot number and color so that he can win money and they can get on to a better place. Rick saved that woman from a huge burden and it completely makes up for his owning a fixed wheel. <br/><br/>This is much in the same way reflective of American society. As a country we are constantly doing what we need to get ahead in life, even if for some people it requires cheating or lying; much the same way we have tremendous powers over other countries we didn't get it just by sweet-talking.

","Favored among many movie enthusiasts, Casablanca is a well-made American classic. The film gives the audience a taste of the atmosphere that existed in Casablanca, Morocco during the Nazi regime of WWII. In the film, Casablanca is the destination for anyone who didn't want to be found. For the criminals, escapees and the refugees fleeing from Nazi oppression, Casablanca was not only a safe haven, but also a gateway to a Hitler-free world.<br/><br/>There in Casablanca, exists a popular nightclub called Rick's, where most of these stowaways end up as they wait for their ticket out of the country. It's a trendy gin joint with gambling, music and drinking that ironically reflects the atmosphere of the country or 'safe haven' Rick originates from, America, 'The Land of The Free'. At Rick's, the only 'American' nightclub in Casablanca, people from all backgrounds and cultures are welcome to relax and hang out without being persecuted, prosecuted or detained. It retains the party atmosphere and indulges in the carefree lifestyle that America commonly depicts. But beneath it all, lies the underground network of allies made up of intrigue, meticulous scheming and corrupt officials. In the middle of this soup of deceptiveness and illegality is Rick, standing neutral and bold.<br/><br/>Rick Blaine (Humphrey Bogart) is a man who stands alone and looks out for no one but himself. By holding onto that pitiless tough-guy persona he reveals to the crowd, he's able to hide emotion and stray away from heartache, which as the film progresses, takes the focus away from the romance and the Nazis and places it on Rick's struggle to redefine himself. Bogart's brilliant characterization harmonizes beautifully with the performance of the stunning Ingrid Bergman, who plays Rick's old flame Ilsa 'Kid' Laslo. Together this romantic duo set the screen on fire as the sexual tension mounts between them.<br/><br/>Technically speaking, the film didn't use any groundbreaking techniques with the lighting, camera work, or sound. For this film in particular, simple was good. No special effects, innovative camera movements or directing methods generated an uncomplicated love story that the audience could easily focus on.<br/><br/>With quotable quotes and original an story line, there is no wonder why this film is a favorite to many. It's perfect for anyone who adores a good love story. Certainly not one of the greatest films ever made, it is however, one of the most influential films ever made, which justifies its status as an American classic."

","Casablanca, does it reflect society or does society reflect this little hole in the wall resort? When watching the movie, one can't help but notice all the lines that just seem so cliché and yet fit so well into the story; is it because the coolest cat of them all (Humphrey Bogart) is delivering them? Is it because this movie is completely satirical in nature so it just adds humor to the plot? Or is it because the clichés we hear everyday have come from this movie all 10 + of them. <br/><br/>Maybe not so much reason number 2 but definitely reason 3 and perhaps a little of number 1. Humphrey Bogart is THE definition of 'cool'; literally, look it up in the dictionary and his picture will be there. So when this swanky, hip guy says 'Here's lookin' at you kid' for the umpteenth time, it's acceptable because it's Bogey, and what Bogey does is cool, never overdone. <br/><br/>This movie is set during WWII and is about a leader from the underground movement (Victor Laszlo played by Paul Henreid), his wife (Ilsa Lund Laszlo played by Ingrid Bergman) and the owner of a little café, (Rick Blaine played by Humphrey Bogart). It is about when they have a chance meeting in Morocco, some for a first introduction and others for a surprise reunion. Of course, there is a lovely flashback set to the lovers' song and the story of what happened years ago and how things have ended up the way they are becomes clear. As a 15 year-old freshmen this movie wasn't enjoyable, but 3 years later this movie is absolutely adorable and very much recommended as a 'must-see'. Berlin and Bogart has such chemistry and the story has such an interesting twist, it's hard to accept but at the same time that's how things must be. It leaves you with a sense of completion but at the same time uneasy because there are other possibilities that will never be fulfilled. 3 weeks later, the lost dreams are still irritating to this reviewer. <br/><br/>American society is defiantly portrayed in this film, Humphrey plays a café owner that, 9 times out of 10, is doing something for his own benefit, but then he does something to help someone else and it just seems to completely mask the 'bad' things he may have done. For example, there is gambling going on in Rick's Café; there is a roulette wheel, in fact, a fixed one. This wheel is fixed so that Rick is getting more returns back and it isn't a fair game of chance. But then a woman in a desperate situation with a genuine need for money to save herself, her husband, and their marriage comes along and Rick gets soft. He then discreetly tells the woman's husband the winning slot number and color so that he can win money and they can get on to a better place. Rick saved that woman from a huge burden and it completely makes up for his owning a fixed wheel. <br/><br/>This is much in the same way reflective of American society. As a country we are constantly doing what we need to get ahead in life, even if for some people it requires cheating or lying; much the same way we have tremendous powers over other countries we didn't get it just by sweet-talking. But other people will come along once in a while and hit a soft spot in your heart and there is an urge to do the right thing and help them out, much like a country will be in need and we'll help them out, hopefully in the best way possible. <br/><br/>This movie is really a great one; it has love, danger, and politics, an interesting mixture of topics to keep every person interested in some way.

Rick an owner of a cafe is in Casablanca for a reason that know one knows.He is very professional and is strictly on business with customers.

","Casablanca is a monumental film in the history of Hollywood and film-making itself. As many of following films have borrowed a similar story line and people all over quote lines from it lacking the knowledge that Casablanca is the film form which it originated. This is a subtle blend of love and loss along with the underworld gang politics. It takes place in a town called Casablanca in Morrocco. This is the place known to be ht elast chance of reaching the dream of a ticket out to America, the land of freedom, this being specified by the fact it takes place during WWII. Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman make a beautiful on screen couple, who give off incredible chemistry not only romantically speaking but also acting wise. Bogart could't have added or taken away form his portrayal of a top man in the underground during those times. His natural charm shone through and there is such a mysteriousness to him that not only catches the audience but also captivates many women who surround him. Ingrid Bergman possess a flowing beauty that aided her performance of the only woman sane enough to break Bogart's heart. Casablanca is not only about a romance gained and then lost, but is deals with life back in WWII, when so much was kept as secrets and people lived in fear for their lives and future. Director Michael Curtiz and the writers definitely reflected their ingenious creativity by subtly placing a good amount of symbolism in Casablanca. Now aside from the shining stars Bogart and Bergamn it can not be left unsaid that what really made Casablanca spark was the presence of Sam's soothing piano playing. All in all the day Casablanca was introduced to its faithful fans was ""the beginning of a beautiful friendship."""

","`Casa Blanca,' is a film directed by Michael Curtiz and released in 1942, which stars Humphrey Bogart as Rick Blaine, Ingrid Bergman as Ilsa Laszlo, Paul Henreid as Victor Laszlo, and Claude Rains as Captain Renault. `Casa Blanca' is a classic love story, set during WWII, which stars Rick as the main character. Rick owns a club in Casablanca, which is a popular spot to come for all people wanting to escape to America for a better life. It just so happens Rick's former love interest shows up with her husband who is a very important man as far as the war goes, which interests certain people in very high places. Rick is a very emotionally detached, `tell it how it is,' honest kind of guy, with a mysterious carisma. Some would say what a REAL man is. Rick seems to hide a lot about himself, which draws in viewers in on how Rick will react to situations. Which in itself foreshadows Rick ultimate choice, the right thing to do, or what he feels is right to do. Viewing this film in black and white really brings out the feeling of when this movie was set. Overall, I give this movie an 8.5 out of 10 because it's a classic, and will bring a tear to anyone's eye. This film brings the viewer closer to characters, because the director, as well as the actors, bring their characters to life, making it seem as if this story could have been true."

","Casablanca takes place in the little town of Morocco during WW11. Casablanca is a city that many refugees flee to, in search for a new life and a new world. When first watching this movie, the viewer (especially if the viewer is a female) cannot help but notice the romantic plot, the perfect romance plot at that. However, Director Michael Curtiz, focused on other elements in the movie to add more relevance that the viewer could better understand, and relate to. Though the entire story was fictional, the information that you receive from the plot is 100% true information about how life truly was during the war. The reality of the war really sets in, and it's inevitably that the audience will have compassion on what people went through during this time. 	Not only was the history and received information of this film outstanding, the characters were as well. Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman are a phenomenal asset to the film. There connection was so intense, that the whole room of viewers only just assumed that they were together. Bogart's stern and strong character keeps the viewer on the edge of their seat only guessing what he will come up with next. His constant battle to do what is right or to do what he wants adds constant guessing to viewers mind.<br/><br/>	All in all this film was amazing. Sure the acting was rather exaggerated at moments, and the characters really lacked in their depth at times, but this movie has been viewed and talked about for years, only proving that it is a classic. Man quotes from this movie are being used in people's vocabulary, and they don't even know where the quote came from. All of that can be found in the classic and phenomenal story of Casablanca."

","Casablanca shows the goodness of American freedom. The movie is set in a small town named Casablanca where Europeans would escape to get away from the turmoil of war during WWII. They would hopefully from there escape to America. This film has a little bit of everything. It has drama, comedy, and of course a love story to add a finishing touch to this great film. Humphrey Bogart who plays Rick Blaine is one of the star characters of this film. He did a great job portraying the cocky, yet sweet guy who is willing to help anybody. Just watching the film you would want to give him a huge hug. Ingrid Bergman plays Ilsa Laszlo. She is Rick's old flame she also did a great job. When the love story heats up between the two of them and they worked very well together. They had great on screen chemistry. It is not only the acting that makes this such a great picture, it is the script. It has the infamous phrases just as.. `Here's to looking at you, kid' and most likely you've heard this one.. `This is the beginning of a beautiful friendship'. It's phrases like that, that makes it such a classic. It is also a trendsetting movie. If it weren't for Casablanca there wouldn't be catchy phrases put into movies now. This film impacted America in many ways, not only for films and culture but also in music. The famous song `As time goes by' became popular from that movie and it is still popular today. It is definitely a movie to see.  This film truly describes Americana and there is no other word to describe this movie than classic and it always will be."
"JPTaylor","9","0","1","29 April 2004"," What more can be said?
","While not a perfect film, Casablanca achieves what few other films have.  It completely immerses the viewer in the era and the atmosphere, offering a journey to the ever distant (yet all too close) world of Casablanca, Morocco during World War II.  It is the hope of thousands (if not millions) of refugees, yet for so many who live there it is a prison - a last, impossibly difficult gate to freedom from the war-torn European countryside.<br/><br/>In Casablanca is a night club, Rick's.  It's a self-indulgent gambling, music and drinking joint that's a parody of the American dream in a foreign land.  The piano rings with Sam's melodious delivery of universal themes of love, pain, and cheer.  Below the surface is a circle of intrigue - few tell of their allegiance to the Allied cause, and yet fewer live to spread the word.  Rick Blaine, the owner of the club, walks the fine line of neutrality.<br/><br/>Humphrey Bogart, in his portrayal of Rick, is no longer a character but an American icon.  Many of his lines can be quoted, verbatim, by people who have never even seen this film.  His cynical, callous, chain-smoking personality is a mask to hide emotion and protect himself from pain  this is clearly an archetype for countless characters since.  His key philosophy is ""I stick my neck out for nobody.""  Thus, the ultimate struggle of the film is not a frenzied firefight with Nazis or a an elaborate chase scene, but one man's struggle to define himself.<br/><br/>Many of the other characters in the film are equally interesting - Casablanca is a film of choices. Ilsa is a French dame who must decide between the man who will never forgive her and the man who needs her more than anyone else.  Victor Lazlo, the leader of an underground resistance movement in Czechoslovakia, must make a choice between his love, and his sense of honor.  Captain Renault is a Vichy officer who must choose between serving the winning side or his own true loyalty.<br/><br/>Casablanca is deserving of its near-universal and prolific praise.  It is a film of memorable characters and lines, filled with subtlety and complexity. Once it grips ahold of the viewer, it never lets go.  Aside from a bit of over-acting and some characters somewhat lacking in depth, it is a triumph of cinema."
"meggs212","Null","0","1","29 April 2004"," The best love triangle movie
","`Here's to looking at you, kid' was probably the most overused line in the movie, but nevertheless, Casablanca was one of the best love triangle/war movies that I have ever seen.  The movie is set during WWII when people from Europe are traveling to Casablanca to try to get to America, where it was safer.  This was a very hard and risky thing to do. 	 Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman lit up the screen playing Rick Blaine, an exiled American and owner of a well-known cafe and Ilsa Lund laszlo, Rick's love interest that left him in Paris when she found out that her husband was alive. 	 Meeting in Paris, Rick and Ilsa fall in love and plan to spend the rest of their lives together, until Rick receives a letter from Ilsa before boarding a train saying that they can't ever see each other again.  Rick is torn apart, especially when he sees her again unexpectedly at his café and is obviously very bitter towards her.  He later finds out that she left him in Paris because she found out her husband was alive. 	 I really liked Humphrey Bogart in this movie.  He played the bad boy, which seems to be a reoccurring role in the older classic films.  Although he was perceived as a rebel who `doesn't stick his neck out for no one', he was the kind of guy who would do the right thing in the end that was best for everyone.  I think he's a great actor who delivers his lines well and makes the scene seem very realistic. 	 I thought that the movie was well done.  The were many scenes in which there was mostly talking and a lot of information was given at one time making the movie somewhat confusing at times, but for the most part it was a great film.  There were many parts that movies today copy, which made the movie interesting to watch.  Although I am not a big fan of war/love movies, I thought that this was a classic because of Bogart and Bergman's incredible performances.  Even the corniest parts such as the flashbacks and the famous line, `Here's to looking at you kid' were well done. 	 Everyone should see this movie at least once; it's a classic that has been an inspiration to many filmmakers for many years."

","Casablanca has inspired many, including Woody Allen with his 1981 movie titled, ""Play it Again, Sam"". Even though it is a movie made in a time when production studios were pushing out roughly a film per week. No one could have known what an impact it would have on the movie world.<br/><br/>	Like the very first line in the movie says, the only thing the refugees in Casablanca could do is wait, and wait, and wait for the chance to make their way to Lisbon and finally to the place they had only dreamt of going to, America. As an American watching this film, one must have some sort of pride. To think that people from other countries would do whatever it took just to come to the place that so many take advantage of. Talk about a reality check for us spoiled Americans. Being Michael Curtiz's goal or not, a viewer may stop and think for a moment about how much they appreciate their country. In the time of war that the movie was released, maybe that is what the American people needed. A reminder of what thier loved ones were fighting for. 	            <br/><br/>       One doesn't normally think of love and personal struggles that people go through at a time of war. But Casablanca incorporates the personal tragedies that went on behind the big picture, without losing sight of the big picture. People who watch Casablanca now get to see what love may have been like during war, even though not many people can say that they have been in the same situation as Rick Blaine (played by Humphrey Bogart). But many can say that they have had a lost love, or if they can't relate to that, that may be able to relate to letting true love go, no matter how much it hurt. That's a reason why Casablanca is a classic, it deals with issues that real people go through, and when people can relate to what they see on the big screen, they'll keep watching. 	<br/><br/>        Of course being made in 1942, Casablanca has some things that make it a little dated. The backdrops from when Rick is thinking back on the times that he and Ilsa had shared back in Paris are horrible and hard to look at. The acting isn't exactly perfect, but still believable. Humphrey Bogart does a wonderful job of being cool in every sense of the word. Ingrid Bergman also does a wonderful acting job. Her and Bogart have a great chemistry thaty doesn't seem at all forced. Some of the things in the film are hard to understand and keep track of, but other than that and things that only can be blamed on the fact that it was made in 1942, this movie is absolutely wonderful."

When it was released in 1943 America was fully entering World War II.  While the Nazis were invading France and everyone else trying to move to the Americas, A beautiful film was being depicting a love story of two unfolded on screen.  This movie, with it's ever so famously quotable lines, could have been easy for men and women of that era to relate to.  As Rick had to say goodbye to Elsa, many men and women of that time were saying goodbye to each other, as then men took off for war.  <br/><br/>Some may say ""Casablanca"" is too dialogued and not enough action, that was just the point.  Though it may have been set in a time when action was plentiful, this movie was more about dialog and acting.  Just like a great writer, it takes time to understand their writing.  ""Casablanca"" takes more understanding, then the car racing people killing and risque make out scenes of today, but it is well worth the time.<br/><br/>Rick (Humphrey Bogart) may come of as a tough never been in love before kind of guy. He hides a much softer side and only one woman can bring out, Elsa. Elsa is played by Ingrid Verdman.  That felt she has married the wrong man. Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Verdman act extremely well with one another. Bogart's scene where he remembers his past comes off convincing as he cries his problems into a bottle of alcohol.<br/><br/>Although not much action shots are seen among this movie to make it amazing, the story itself comes off interesting.  Taking the time out to understanding ""Casablanca"" may make the film more enjoyable than it seems. This romantic movie set in the time of war comes out to be one of the best or well known movies of all time.  Whether you've seen it or not, you've probably heard of it.

"working98","Null","0","2","21 January 2004"," So, that's it, huh?
","Certain movies gain a status whereby their name becomes an invocation. Star Wars, Psycho, Citizen Kane, Jaws, Titanic and certainly Casablanca qualify as movies that virtually anyone can get a freeze frame in their mind. They can name the key actors, recite dialogue, and even give an overview of the plot without necessarily even having seen the film in person.<br/><br/>The legend of Casablanca exceeds most films ever produced.  The film is held in a near religious regard which is normally reserved for fans of genre films.  (Witness the slavish devotion to the Star Wars product line despite the increasing evidence that the creator of these films has lost not only touch with reality, but even a rememberance of what made the first film so compelling.)  And having finally seen Casablanca for myself I am left unsetteled at how unimpressed I was by this classic of modern cinema.<br/><br/>
The setting for the story is unique enough.  Nazi controlled North Africa is not a familiar device for gushy romances.  But a city does not a movie make. The story itself isn't terribly deep.  Old lovers reunited.  Unfinished business must remain that way.  They part unfulfilled.  And the characters are not written in such a way as to give them depth and persona beyond their plot-driven dialogue.  Cinematography is to my untrained eye, dull and unremarkable.  O.K. the sets are nicely done.<br/><br/>But the greatest deficiency of them all is the performance given by the leading man.  Humphrey Bogart is a legend among tough guy actors.  Why was he cast in the role of an introspective gentleman entrepeneur?  While even uttering these thoughts has in past and undoubtedly will again make me the target of jihad by the most bloodthirsty classic movie fans, I must say I've seen better performances on Murder, She Wrote.  Honestly.<br/><br/>In fact I would go so far as to say that people in need of an object lesson in miscasting and insufficient artistic depth would do well to take notes on Bogey's performance here.<br/><br/>I would be remiss if I did not interject here the beatific Ingrid Berman and the scene stealing Claude Rains.  These two people are about the only enjoyable part of the entire process and keep the film from being a shambles.<br/><br/>The saving grace that I repeatedly hear offered up in defense of this film is that it is old.  I find this utterly insufficient.  Noting that a film was made prior to 1970 seems to excuse all manner of technical and story related problems.  Everyone wants to put it into the context of how bad every other movie was back then.  Now perhaps if I had not seen more modern dramas, I would be thrilled with this movie, but using the same measuring stick by which I judge any new film, this one comes up terrible short."

","Spoilers<br/><br/>I must apologize for the self-serving summary line. Although I wasn't exactly around when the movie was first released, I could have watched it years ago. Considering all the revivals, special screenings, TV showings and DVDs that have been available, it would appear that the only reason why I still hadn't seen it was that I deliberately avoided it. But I didn't. Yesterday, however, everything changed. I finally saw Casablanca, for the first time in my life. And I was absolutely delighted that it wasn't on a TV screen, but in the new, opulent Palace Cinema in the plush International Finance Centre (housing the 90-story skyscraper from the top of which Lara Croft did her gliding swoop through the Hong Kong city centre, landing in a boat in Victoria Harbour). No more digressions.<br/><br/>This cinematic experience of Casablanca was absolutely worth waiting for. Even to people who have never seen the movie, it had become so much of our daily life: from the immortal As Time Goes By to quotes such as `I think it is the beginning of a beautiful friendship', not to mention `play it again Sam'. Yet despite all the familiarity, Casablanca has all the freshness of a movie that you see for the first time, and this freshness is the kind that does not fade with the passage of time, when even the very title of the movie had long been made into a song with a separate life of its own.<br/><br/>One of the most important thing that drives Casablanca in a brisk, crisp pace (without relying on today's tedious explosions and car chases) is the excellent dialogue. While obviously not in the same class as Wilde's sparkling wit or Shaw's titillating, satirical humour, the dialogue in Casablanca is among the best you'll ever find in a movie. It tells stories, conveys emotions and at the same time grasps your attention. I wouldn't try to deny that the story is somewhat predictable and none of the elements, taken separately, is new. However, they are put together with such masterful control, perfectly balanced with sensitivity to details. In the scene when Bogart takes money out to the safe for the attendant to pay a winner at his casino, showing him in silhouette is a stroke of brilliance. Better still is the famous train station scene, where raindrops fall slowly onto Bergman's farewell note, washing the words away.<br/><br/>Bogart is his usual cool persona. The supporting cast is of the rarest quality, particularly Claude Rains. But for Casablanca to be where it is, it owes most to Ingrid Bergman. Captain Renault (Rains), in his first encounter with Ilsa Lund Laszlo (Bergman), has a line to the effect of something like `They say that you will be the most beautiful woman that ever comes to Casablanca. Now this is a gross understatement'. While this line may serve for Ilsa Lund Laszlo, it certainly does not do full justice to Ingrid Bergman, especially her smiles, with which she lights up the world with the moon and rules the earth with the sun (courtesy of W.S. Gilbert, in The Mikado)."

","Ever since I first saw this film years back, I wondered where all the praise came from. Then I realized -- movies with figures of huge importance are widely regarded as masterpiece material.<br/><br/>Citizen Kane has a man of large wealth and power. Casablanca has a widely respected night club owner. The Godfather has mafia kingpin Vito Corleone.<br/><br/>Why is it so interesting for us to see men in power? I think it's because subconsciously we connect with the feelings of power - and in a way ride the American dream with these dreamlike images. These movies are true cinema - as it was always intended to be. The acting, the score, the dialog, the staging, etc, etc ... it's all great. <br/><br/>As Rick fades into his first flashback with Ilsa and Sam hammers away at the piano we realize that we've now experienced something.<br/><br/>
The direction is slow and methodical, as I like for it to be and I honestly believe this is cinematic art -- much different from painting art on a Hollywood palette. This is the kind of movie that will change the way you dream and has one of the widest known film quotes ever: ""Here's looking at you, kid.""<br/><br/>The only thing that drags down the score is the over-hyper customers that often annoyed me. This doesn't detract much; but it's still there and I felt it improper when the rest of the flow is so formal.<br/><br/>A-: Good film experience with screen legend Humphrey Bogart giving his best performance. Those who are easily annoyed may need to bear with this one, though."

","What can I say that hasn't already been said.  Casablanca is the Perfect movie.  Superb script, packed with memorable dialogue and one-liners. Fantastic characters, Bogart being one of THE great cinematic heroes. Scenes of dramatic tension and heart-stopping romance.  It may be cliched and rely on narrative coincidences (guess who wrote a film studies essay on this film), but when all the elements combine, who cares?  This film is timeless, being as superb today as it will be tomorrow, and the day after that, etc.<br/><br/>My Rating: 10/10"

","In Casablanca what is most noticeable is the way separate filmic elements join to create a whole. Under the supervision of Michael Curtiz all the necessary ingredients to make this film successful come together magically. I use the word successful because that's what the film is. It does what it sets out to do. It's fun to watch and not high art nor the most involving and deeply moving experience in film history but it works. 	 Curtiz's direction deserves to be mentioned first with all the ballyhoo and trumpet-tounged praise this film receives I had never known the name of the man who directed the film. In this film not only does he construct a very well-told visual narrative but he also provide some frames that floored me, most noticeably an establishing shot of The Blue parrot including an actual blue parrot, and the shadow used to establish La Belle Aurore. His insistence on his casting decisions also made the film what it is as a landmark in Hollywood history. Changing any one of the actors would likely have made the studio's prediction of it being a flop-come-true. 	 Humphrey Bogart could not have been better suited for his part. For through most of the film we see Rick Blain as cool and unflinching. Only in the flashback do we see his more emotional and less pragmatic side. Slowly we see revelations he helps the Humgarian girl he also quarrels with Ilsa over their failed love affair. Even in this film we find Bogart in his persona of the heroic loner which we would find in many of his films. 	 In what is probably the best piece of casting was Ingrid Bergman as Ilsa. Aesthetically Bergman has one of those faces that was just made to be filmed in black and white. She is luminous. She plays Ilsa to a tee and truly makes the love affair back drop of the film both during the flashback sequence and when she pleads in tears for Rick's assistance. In every film romance both actors have to be equals and suited for one another, this pair is. 	 The secondary players were also crucial. In such a way they can scarcely be called secondary characters. The most artistic part of Casablanca is that Curtiz both in the beginning and towards the end takes us amongst, little vignettes, snatches of the lives of the people who live their temporary existences in this town that's merely a gateway to Lisbon, then America. With the dual story of refugees and the love stories the secondary characters take on even greater importance. Claude Rains, when he's on the screen it's like there's no one else around. His excuse for closing down the café was the only dialogue that stuck in my head after so many years without having watched it. Rains plays his character in such a way that his change of heart at the end is justified and, as written, he is the most complex of all the characters. Peter Lorre, played Ugarte, he was absent through much of the film but Lorre with that voice always leaves an impression with the audience. He also seems to exude a kind of helplessness in this part. Syndey Greenstreet seemed to be the Fat Man out of The Maltese Falcon but in the end he helps his share of people and does a good job also. 	What made itself apparent to me this time as opposed to the first time I saw the film was the omnipresence of propaganda in Casablanca. Propaganda is often regarded as a four-letter word, and that's not always the case but it should always looked at with suspicion. In this film it's handled so intelligently and it's Positive-Propaganda, meaning that it's a call to action rather than a character assassination or anti-something. Rick is told ""Isolationism isn't a practical policy.' He's the only American character of the major figures this is a call to action for the American public to support the US war effort in Europe. The propaganda in this film is so incisive, intelligent and organic to the plot that it shows what a powerful medium film really is. It's interesting to note also that the film was made up of cast and crew mostly from Europe, director Micheal Curtiz, Peter Lorre and Paul Heinreid (Victor Laszlo) were born in the Austro-Hungarian empire, Igrid Bergman was Swedish, Claude Rains and Sydney Greenstreet were English and Colonel Srasser was played by a legend of German cinema Conrad Veidt. 	 What we have in Casablanca is film that can be enjoyed from any angle you look at it. It is a film that will transcend generations for years to come."

","The best part of this movie was when peter lorre walked in with a gun....and that wasnt even close to the scene in Titanic..with the hottie, Leo.  the chemistry between Humfrey Bogard  and Ingrid Berman is awful...not comparable to the homosexual chemistry between dan aakroyd and Danny Stern in Celtic Pride(i have noted this b4 in a [previous review)  The philepeno burglars made this movie what it was....and face it...who wants to see a movie in black and white...that was the kiler and i give it a bad grade<br/><br/>

","Suspenseful and romantic noir of the ""nice people stuck in exotic paradise with a bunch of thugs"" variety rises above its genre and its propagandistic aspects with tight direction, beautiful photography, an engaging story, and one of the best casts ever.  Bogart and Bergman's doomed love story is very effective, and there are some nice suspense scenes and very crisp dialogue in the best WB tradition.  Lovely to look at and enter into, Casablanca is to be experienced again and again in doses large and small."

","The only reason I saw this movie was because everyone told me how wonderful it was. When I finally got through it, I didnt see what the big deal was. Now don't get me wrong, Bogart and Bergman are wonderful actors, but I just didnt like this one. I don't know why it's considered a classic. Maybe just because it's the most quoted movie in history, who knows. Anyway, I thought Bogart was better in The African Queen."

","I have to admit that I am not a huge fan of older movies, classics or not. Most of them are poorly acted and have stories that are completely outdated and frankly I find them quite boring.  But this movie was quite entertaining and I can understand why audiences would go crazy for the film when it first came out.  Not bad, not bad at all."
"PIST-OFF","7","0","4","21 June 1999"," Bogie
","The American Film Institute lists Casablanca as the 2nd or 3rd greatest movie ever. While I will agree that it is a high quality piece of film I can't understand how it can rank that high. The movie is well acted, well directed, and the screenplay contains the more memorable quotes than any movie ever. That is an indicator of either of two things. Either the writing is the greatest ever or people just really cling to the old romance and intrigue story. <br/><br/>I like Bogie's character. What a classic screen drunkard. Try watching this movie and keeping up with the drinking bogie does in it, you'll be face down in an ocean of your own vomit before the twelve minute mark. He is cold to the world and looks at things in a super rational way. Sam shoulda got his own movie. He could have been the 40's version of the Dolemite. Because the rest of the characters seem befuddled next to Bogie it gives the feel of watching a one man show. The story doesn't stand out that much, it's pretty standard Romance material. I'd rather watch Travis Bickle."

","This movie is so boring. It's a bad movie. 20 minutes into the movie and I already wanted to turn it off because it was so bad. The only reason it's a classic and people like it so much is because it has Ingrid Bergman and Humphrey Bogart, it's about nazis, and it has the line ""Here's looking at you kid"" which is so lame. I like old movies but not this one."
"Brad Polley","10","0","1","21 October 2001"," Chemistry at it's best.
","This film might have the best on screen chemistry in movie history.  Ingrid Bergman and Humphrey Bogart make you feel like they really are Rick and Ilsa.  From they way they look at each other to the way they talk to each other both men and women alike will fall in love with this film.<br/><br/>I hope they never try to make a re-make of this film.  I don't think that anybody can duplicate the way Bogart and Bergman make you laugh, cry, and feel good about the world.<br/><br/>Whether you are old or young, man or woman, with somebody or single, this film will make you believe in the goodness of the human spirit."

","The neon lights of ""Rick's Cafe American,"" the smoldering fog of the airfield near the end, The French outdoing the Germans in the game of ""Whose Anthem is better?"", and Sam the piano man singing ""As Time<br/><br/>Goes By,"" these are but a few of the key elements that made CASABLANCA such a classic treasure. Humphrey Bogart made himself as what he is today, the headlining movie star, in this film about love and war in the seamy world of Morrocco during the Second World War. Ingrid Bergman also stars as Rick's old flame Isla, who restirred the fire deep with- in Rick's heart. Their sort of passion is the type that spawned many imitators, but never duplicated. It's that great."

","It has to be. Not only is it extremely well made, but it has a story to kill and everything about it has passed into folklore, becoming icons along the way.<br/><br/>What is curious about this movie is that it gets stronger for every viewing. I remember when I first saw Casablanca, generally regarded as one of the two greatest movies to ever come out of Hollywood: I appreciated it, but I was not yet ready for the devastating emotional impact it has. But once you are familiar with it you see the care the movie makers have taken, you see what they wanted to accent, and some of these scenes are destined to become part of our collective unconscious, if they are not there already.<br/><br/>If you can get the edition with the Lauren Bacall documentary You Must Remember This, all the better.<br/><br/>This movie wins hands down, no contest, as the best movie ever made. It is also the best movie experience you will ever have."
