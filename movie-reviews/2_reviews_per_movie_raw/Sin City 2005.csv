","With Hellboy, Guillermo Del Toro lovingly recreated panels from artist/creator Mike Mignola's comic book stories and brought them to vibrant life, setting a new benchmark for adaptations that respect their source material. With Sin City, however, co-directors Robert Rodriguez and Frank Miller have done more than just recreate the brutal chiaroscuro of Miller's stark post-modern noir artwork, they've captured the essence and the aesthetic of Basin City (as much a character as Marv or Hartigan) and brought its universe and characters to a stunning three-dimensional life. And unlike Hellboy, which suffered from a weak, confusing script, Sin City weaves a Pulp Fiction-esque narrative which snakes through the dark streets and crooked alleyways of this hellish metropolis like a fever dream.<br/><br/>In short, Sin City delivers a blistering ballet of bullets and blood, dames and danger at every turn. It's a kinetic masterpiece of pop culture for the new millennium (and a case could be made that this was the movie that CGI was invented for).<br/><br/>As a Frank Miller fan for over 25 years, I know his work and I know Sin City  and this Sin City will knock your socks off whether you are a fan or a newcomer to the dark delights of his devilish imagination and brutal style. Exceeding my expectations on all levels, this movie ranks as one of the most enjoyable cinema-going experiences I've had in years.<br/><br/>Everything works here. From Rodriguez's cinematography and editing, to the seamless direction (no mean feat when you consider Robert co-directed with Miller and Quentin Tarantino joined the mix as ""Special Guest Director""), to the spot-on casting. The script gives Bruce Willis, Mickey Rourke, Clive Owen and Benicio Del Toro plenty of opportunity to chew the scenery  and they do, especially Rourke, who, despite having his mug buried under a thick layer of gruesome latex, delivers one of the best performances of his career and steals the show as Marv, the giant thug with a broken heart. The ladies hold their own, too. Jessica Alba, Rosario Dawson, Brittany Murphy and Jaime King are all great in their roles, particularly Dawson as machine gun-wielding Dominatrix/Hooker-Godmother Gail. And kudos to Elijah Wood (proving there is life after Hobbits) and Nick Stahl who deliver contrasting performances as vile villains, the ultra-creepy Kevin and the disgusting Yellow bastard, respectively.<br/><br/>Sin City is smart, stylish, sexy and sick. It's also violent and funny. Certainly not a film for the whole family, but for those of us who enjoy our movies rated R, this flick kicks the head and the gut like a mule.<br/><br/>Here's hoping Sin City makes a mint, for there are 10,000 stories in the naked (sinful) city, and this is but a handful of them. I'm already praying for a sequel.<br/><br/>A picture perfect ""ten"" for this cineast."
"pyrocitor","10","21","23","1 May 2005"," Like reading a comic book - literally
","Based on the graphic novels by Frank Miller (who also co-directed and wrote the screenplay) Sin City tells three stories of crime, corruption, and redemption set in the fictional town 'Basin City'. The first story details the quest of Marv (Mickey Rourke) who searches town for the man who murdered Goldie (Jamie King), the woman he believes to be his one true love. The second tells of Dwight (Clive Owen) who must cover up the death of a corrupt police officer (Benicio Del Toro) in order to avoid a war between the cops, and the girls of old town, led by Gail. (Rosiaro Dawson) The final story shows Hartigan, (Bruce Willis) a beat up retired cop framed for a crime he didn't commit, trying to save the life of a girl whose life he saved at a young age, who grew up to become a stripper, (Jessica Alba) while all the while being tracked by a mysterious stranger with a grotesque appearance. (Nick Stahl)<br/><br/>It's a churning vat of old fashioned pulp style stories, each one more dark and edgy then the last. And yet, Sin City itself is morbidly fascinating; if you don't mind delving through the haze of sleaze, violence and corruption you'll find a really compelling story underneath the hard exterior. Sin City exudes the essence of classic film noir, except combined with over-the-top violence, characters and dialogue to maintain that comic book feel. Giving co-director status to creator Frank Miller and allowing him to write the screenplay was perhaps the wisest move director Robert Rodriguez ever made, because Miller's gritty influence shines through, perfectly capturing the mood of his original creations.<br/><br/>And the visuals... extraordinary. The entire film is shot in black and white, except for certain items which appear in colour. (a red dress, red blood, although sometimes the blood is stark white, and not to mention Nick Stahl's character, Yellow Bastard, who is, indeed, yellow) Rodriguez is also smart enough to use a greenscreen backdrop, so as to recreate Miller's gritty, moody sets by computer animation instead of trying to create them first hand. And it works, wonderfully - the sets perfectly set the tone for the rest of the movie: dark, bold, over-the-top and quality work unlike any other. Add the characters' noirish costumes (almost every male character sports, as Marv puts it, a ""damn fine coat"") unique appearances, (it says a lot for the quality of the movie when a character like Yellow Bastard doesn't seem out of place) and movement (take note that if the movie was paused at any given point, the frame would look like a panel from a comic book) and Miller and Rodriguez perfectly nail the comic book feel.<br/><br/>It also helps that a wonderful cast has been assembled to bring life to the mayhem. Spot on performances abroad here, but the standouts in my opinion were Elijah Wood, who was truly chilling as Kevin, the silent, cannibalistic serial killer; Nick Stahl as Roarke Junior/Yellow Bastard, a truly creepy and disgusting character; Clive Owen, playing against type as Dwight; (who isn't exactly a sophisticated, British gentleman, but then again, no one in this film is) Mickey Rourke as Marv, managing to turn out a stunning performance, even with his face buried under several layers of latex; Benicio Del Toro almost unrecognizable as corrupt cop Jackie Boy and a welcome appearance from Michael Clarke Duncan as Manute, an enforcer specializing in inflicting pain. The hard edged ladies also do a great job, with Jessica Alba, Rosiaro Dawson, Carla Gugino, Jamie King and the rest all giving great performances.<br/><br/>It's all in the style of such films as Pulp Fiction and Kill Bill, so it may be wise to use those films as guidelines of what to expect in terms of content. It's true that Sin City is not for everyone: the violence is brutal and unflinching, most characters are disreputable, manipulative and sleazy, and the whole feel of the film is undesirable, and not too cheery. But if none of that deters you, Sin City should be known as a must see, for the superb visual stylistics if nothing else. But the style and feel of the comic books is perfectly captured and thrust into our faces. Frank Miller must be proud.<br/><br/>-10/10"
"SteakTheCow","10","450","598","17 March 2005"," Quite Possibly the Most Accurate Comic Adaptation. Ever.
","Sin City in its original serialized comic form was everything that one would expect from the then well known artist/writer/creator Frank Miller and more. Many would come to say that it is his best work.<br/><br/>For years it was a world that only existed on paper in black and white with splashes of color, but it was enough to make Sin City live and breath in ways that few others in the medium have ever been able to come close to. Because Miller's dark, noir overtones painted a very clear, and fully realized picture of every seedy back alley and strip club, and cheap motel room in the fictional Basin City it became painfully obvious that it was just too visceral a place to ever be real in a way that could be encapsulated on film, or at least we, including Miller himself, thought. We were wrong.<br/><br/>This is THE comic movie we have been waiting for and it does not disappoint from the first overly dramatic voice-over to the last frame of the credit scroll. Telling three tales from Miller's world (The Hard Goodbye, The Big Fat Kill, and That Yellow Bastard) the comic transitions from paper to cellulose flawlessly and believably with a grace seldom seen. This ease is especially incredible for something so over the top and stylized like this that it's almost hard to imagine that these are the actors you've grown to know and love for years. But they are and it all comes together beautifully.<br/><br/>The cast, crew, and artists involved in making this adaptation a reality should be commended for their service to the idea that a true comic book movie can, in fact, be made without making concessions to the masses, without altering the plot or changing the characters, and still manage to retain the feel that the ink on paper had while creating a truly entertaining film. Much of this film's success can be directly contributed to the fantastic casting job which encompasses an incredibly long list of a-list and up and coming celebs plus a few obscure but cult favorites (yes, I'm talking to you Rutger) and the tag team direction of Frank Miller and Robert Rodriguez. Rodriguez should be particularly touted for pushing Miller to finally do this project, and for leading the way to make this the film that Miller always wanted it to be and that Rodriguez knew he could make.<br/><br/>While I do have a few nit-picky points of contention with cut dialog or certain actors/actresses that refused to bare it all for the sake of keeping intact every last detail from the books it doesn't change the fact that what was laid out on the polyester film stock before me was every bit as entertaining as the original works, and it made a pretty darn good flick to boot. If it's not already self-evident, the bar has been raised for the comic movie. The next brave soul willing to venture in had better be prepared to take on Sin City."
"sjha-2","10","215","283","2 June 2006"," Avoid this stunning film if violence offends you.
","Channel surfing late one night I stumbled across this film and stopped to look because of the unusual cinematography. It's visually stunning, mostly in b&w and that evokes a film noir atmosphere punctuated with those brilliant flashes of color. Two minutes later I couldn't take my eyes away. This unique film is superbly executed, the casting, the screenplay, the special effects, everything about it. As we all know, there is an expansive library of film work out there for a wide range of tastes and sensibilities. If yours are delicate, if you are offended by gore and violence, then this film will NOT be your cup of tea. Stay away from it. But if both the horror and film noir genres appeal to you, you'll probably find this movie as captivating as I did."
"jtizzle","Null","538","770","17 March 2005"," caught the Philly sneak preview
","I caught the Philly sneak preview of ""Sin City"" yesterday, and I have to say my hat is off. Few comic book movies have ever looked good on screen. The X-Men and Spider Man movies have done a good job breaking that stigma. In my opinion the aforementioned flicks have been a perfect melding of Hollywood and the Comic book universe, but ""Sin City"" elevates it to an art form, literally. It is hands down, the best representation of a comic book turned film ever. After catching the trailer on a TV commercial, I was intrigued, to say the least. So I went to my local comic book store and bought the Frank Miller books the movie is based on, and enjoyed them for their off beat humor, incredible violence, and stories of love, lust, friendship, honor and seedily-earned redemption in the underworld of fictional Basin City. Upon further contact with the Comic Book store owner, he clued me in to the sneak preview on the 16th of March (yesterday as I post this), so like a kid on his way to pick up the latest issues of whatever comics are popular these days, I took the day off and went to the showing. Having recently read the stories that are included in the film (""Sin City,"" later renamed to ""The Hard Goodbye""; ""The Big Fat Kill;"" and ""That Yellow Bastard""), I was amazed at how much of the dialogue and narration of the books actually made it to the big screen translation. This coming from a guy whose heart was ripped out by the bastardization of ""The Sum of All Fears,"" bear in mind - I know what it's like to have a book you love not be given the loving attention we feel it deserves when it hits the big screen. The dialogue isn't always the best (it's a comic book, not Shakespeare, people) and even the best acting in the world won't change that. But seriously, if you're paying attention to that minor blemish, you're missing the point of the movie to begin with. Aside from the dialogue, the imagery in the film is something to be appreciated, whether you like the stories or not. Equally beautiful and gritty black and white, with occasional brushes of color that all but explode off the screen- the comic books (graphic novels to you purists) act like storyboards for this movie- as life is breathed into the still images on the pages. The ""From Book to Screen"" section that is no doubt going to be a feature on the future DVD release of this movie will no doubt drop a few jaws for those that haven't bothered to check out the source material. Cold, cruel humor and over-the-top, audience-wince-inducing violence are blended in the style of ""Pulp Fiction"" and ""From Dusk 'Till Dawn"" for obvious reasons, but as I stated before, it's all direct from the books. Kudos to Robert Rodriguez for not compromising in the making of this film and for his commitment to the original source material; and also to his co-director Frank Miller for his obvious contributions. And to the actors in it- the cavalcade of them. My favorite performance was turned in by Mickey Rourke for playing Marv absolutely letter perfect from the book (and he demonstrates one of the best narrative voices I've heard in a movie since Morgan Freeman in ""The Shawshank Redemption""). Elijah Wood has a non-speaking role, but his Kevin will follow you home as much as Nick Stahl's Junior does. Clive Owen is solid as Dwight (and I know a lot of geek fan-boys out there were upset that he was picked for the character) and Bruce Willis does what he does best as a cop that won't quit, Hartigan. The standout female performance is a toss up between either Rosario Dawson for her valkyrie, warrior, hooker Gail, or (it kills me to say it) Brittany Murphy as a ""His Girl Friday"" cocktail waitress. The movie is definitely not for all tastes, and kids shouldn't be allowed in buildings even next to theaters showing this movie- but it will no doubt be a hotly discussed film as we creep through Hollywood's typically ""phoned-in, pre-Summer"" Feb/March/April offerings."
"SunDevil21","10","477","700","17 March 2005"," Truly a comic book brought to life!
","I must admit that I know, or knew rather, very little about the story or history of Frank Miller and his series of comic book novels - and maybe that is why I enjoyed this movie so much. Although, this is still a different type of situation where one who was a big fan of the stories might be seriously critical of every little detail of the comic book turned movie. I don't believe anyone who considers themselves truly knowledgeable about Miller's work can say that this was not represented well on the big screen. I'm now intrigued to go back and check out some of his work.<br/><br/>That aside, as far as it being a movie and a work of art, I would give this movie high marks in both categories. For it being a movie, it was nice to see something so different as far as the approach to making it go. Also, having such an incredible cast makes it all the more intriguing. I don't see anyone else having portrayed any of these characters any better than the cast that was hired to do so.<br/><br/>On an artistic level, it is extremely hard to think of any other movie that comes close to being in the same league. I did not see Sky Captain, but I would say that anyone who liked Pleasantville for its cinematography and graphic elements, would love Sin City. The use of black and white photography with only specific colors added later make for a far more dramatic effect. And so much of the cinematography being so close to a ""moving picture"" version of comic book art simply makes this movie worth seeing.<br/><br/>Take the artistic elements of this movie, and put it together with the amazing cast (both looks and talent) and throw it together with a very different but coherent plot, and you've got yourself an extremely enjoyable movie that is definitely worth seeing. And seeing at the theater no less!<br/><br/>My hats off to Robert Rodriguez, Frank Miller, and the rest of the cast and crew for putting together something different for a change. <br/><br/>My only complaint about the whole movie - the use of labeling Quentin Tarantino as a ""Special Guest Director"" is almost too lame to deal with."
"mikey1969","8","396","593","18 March 2005"," Wow! Comics done right...
","Went to a sneak preview of this movie today, and I was blown away. Over the years people have tried to emulate the feel of comics on the screen, and met with mild success(Dick Tracy), minor failure(Hulk), and solid success(Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow). This is hard to do, but Sin City hits this dead on. The film is entirely in black and white(Except for about 20 seconds that I noticed in one scene.), except for highlights of color(Gorgeous eyes, splattered blood, and red Converse All-Stars to name a few.). This gives the film a feel that immerses you into the storyline. Add to this the overly corny duologue and scenes where scantily(And I DO mean scantily) clad women pull Uzi's out of literally nowhere, and you have all the right makings for a transfer of a comic book to the screen. The duologue had me laughing almost constantly, but it's easy to tell that they wanted you to laugh, even when they lines were incredibly corny and melodramatic...<br/><br/>The performances in the movie were great as well. I believe my favorite male character was Marv, played by Micky Rourke, and my favorite female character was definitely Miho, played by Devon Aoki. It seems that everyone and their dog was either in this movie, or lent some of their talents to it, and it shows.<br/><br/>I would definitely suggest that you see this in the theatre the very first time, because it will NEVER have the same impact on your TV at home as it does on a 30-foot screen in a dark theatre. I was actually able to note a few times where the digital cameras were able to outperform anything film could do.<br/><br/>A lot of violence in this movie, although most of it is either totally cartoon-style, or off camera, and some gore as well... A good amount of nudity in the film, ALL of it on camera, so you'll probably want to leave the kiddies at home.<br/><br/>All in all, one of the best movies I have seen in a long time, and I'll probably go see it again while it's in the theatres, so that my fiancé can enjoy it as well..."
"Prostheticwings","9","378","576","18 March 2005"," Beautiful!
","I'm only a marginal comics fan - I read a bunch of stuff over the course of a year or two in college and haven't read much at all since. Frank Miller was my favorite writer then and the I always loved the Sin City series. I didn't realize the movie was even being made until I saw the notice for the preview screening (if that's an indication of how much I follow comics these days).<br/><br/>This movie was as perfect an adaptation of those books as I could imagine. The look, cast, atmosphere, everything was just spot on. The stories were all gripping and intertwined with each other nicely and I thought the brief Josh Hartnett spots were great bookends to the movie. I was amazed the entire length of the screening.<br/><br/>If you're into comics at all you'll love this movie. You won't be disappointed. I'm not sure how to recommend it to others but you certainly don't need to be a comics fan to enjoy it. I loved it without reservation."
"craig.tuohy","Null","364","566","23 March 2005"," Stunning...
","If I was to use one word to describe this film it would  have to be....Violent! if i was allowed two words I would add  'Visceral'.  The movie is two hours long and is structured in a similar way to Pulp  Fiction. A bunch of stories set in a consistent world, with characters  falling in and out of each others plot lines. On the whole it works  brilliantly, and for the duration there isn't a boring moment. It is  High octane, million miles and hour storytelling, and it EASILY Robert  Rodriguez's best film.  Allowing Frank Miller to write the script was a fantastic move, as the  dialogue is edgy, witty and VERY faithful to the original material. In  fact, many many lines are just taken straight from the pages. likewise,  the camera behaves like a moving cartoon box out. The framing of all  the key scenes is SO faithful to the printed page that it produces a  truly original look that is fairly incomparable. Visually its a true  original. Sometimes these visuals fall down, there are some very very  obvious digital shots that don't quite gel, but on the whole the  cinematography is jaw dropping. You could literally pause the movie at  almost any point and just hang that frame on a wall, its that  beautiful.  Performances are good all round. Mickey Rourke absolutely nails Marv,  and the girls of Old Town are all as beautiful as they are deadly. The  other standout for me was Elijah Wood, who was truly chilling. Bruce  Willis puts in a solid, if unspectacular turn as Hartigan.  The film isn't entirely void of criticism. there's some fudging of time  lines with Hartigans character (do we really buy Bruce Willis as a  nearly 70 year old man?) and the jumps from story to story are jarring  initially, but once it settles into itself the ride is fantastic.  My other main criticism is the same I have with Quentin Tarantinos  work. That every character and every voice in the movie is the same.  This is more a fault of the source material, but when every single  person is a wise cracking, hard boiled tough guy (even the women) then  it kind of distills the effect of their toughness. In a film that is  predominantly voice over driven, it is hard to differentiate characters  when they all sound exactly the same, both tonally, and in the language  they use. Even Marv, who's supposed to be a meat head, talks in  gravelly prose that would make Bukowski feel like a Nancy.  Other Minor niggles are hardly worth mentioning. From a technical  standpoint the sound effects are WAY to loud. All of the punches,  gunshots etc are given such ridiculous prominence on the track that  they threaten to make mockery of the violence. I actually found that i  didn't want any more guns fired cos it was hurting my ears! all in all  though, its one hell of a ride, and only a couple of notches below Pulp  Fiction on the 'Oh my god that film was cool-o-meter'."
"scolton-1","Null","626","991","17 March 2005"," Sin City is Sinsational!
","Just watched the Advance Screening last night and I must say that this movie pulls all the punches in violence. It deserves its hard R rating in the first five minutes and doesn't let up until the end credits roll. It has it all - bullets, boobs and be-headings - beautifully set in a grim atmosphere that really keeps you on the edge of your seat. All cast performances were excellent - especially Mickey Rourke's ""Marv"" character. Fans of the comic will not be disappointed in this film adaption. This movie is definitely not for the squeamish or faint-of-heart.<br/><br/>Sin City grabs you by the nuts and doesn't let go! A must see!"
"dee.reid","10","13","16","18 August 2005"," ""Sin City"" - Digitalized violence, film-noir, steroids, and comic book greatness!
","""Sin City,"" directed by one of the greatest directorial trifectas - Robert Rodriguez, ""Sin City"" graphic novel creator Frank Miller and special guest director Quentin Tarantino - is a visually stunning and breathtaking piece of film-noir graphic novel, cinematic greatness on steroids.<br/><br/>By and large, this is what a movie based on a comic book should be. It's flawlessly adapted from the source material, with only a few slight changes (presumably to avoid the more explicit contents of the original comic book) and many of Miller's panels come to life on the screen through Rodriguez's skillfully placed camera. Comic book movies represent one of the remaining avenues for truly original film-making, and ""Sin City"" takes full advantage of its digitalized violence and groundbreaking CGI vainglory. And the cast (and what a cast!) brings the shady, corrupt characters to life, along with the amoral Basin City metropolis they inhabit.<br/><br/>As a newbie reader of Miller's work on ""Sin City,"" I was amazed at the care that went into Rodriguez's attention to the story as it unfolded on the screen. As mentioned earlier, the visuals are lifted right out of the original ""Sin City"" graphic novel panels, so audience members would not have to be readers themselves to understand what's going on.<br/><br/>Although the world of ""Sin City"" exists through seven transversal story arcs, the film primarily focuses in on Miller's three tales ""The Hard Goodbye,"" ""The Big Fat Kill,"" and ""That Yellow Bastard."" It's brutal, it's violent, it's vicious, it's beautiful, and it's sinful. The events in ""Sin City"" kickoff after a brief narration by The Man (Josh Hartnett)...<br/><br/>In ""The Hard Goodbye,"" a hulking, hard-luck loser named Marv (Mickey Rourke, under about 15 pounds of prosthetic makeup) wakes up in the bed of a run-down motel room with a dead prostitute laying next to him. The hooker, identified by Marv as Goldie (Jaime King), apparently picked him up in a seedy bar and showed him the time of his life. But, somehow, someway, somebody sneaked into the room and offed her while she slept, and Marv, framed for the murder, now scours the streets and alleys for her killer.<br/><br/>This is my favorite of the three, as ""The Hard Goodbye"" was the first ""Sin City"" graphic novel I picked up at Barnes & Noble Booksellers a few months ago. Rourke is a total bad-ass as Marv, virtually unrecognizable underneath such heavy-duty prosthetics and bandages. He eventually finds his quarry, Kevin (Elijah Wood), a nerd-looking, silent psychopath who kills women, eats them, and hangs their heads on the wall. Rutger Hauer co-stars as Cardinal Roark and a scantily-clad Carla Gugino also appears as Marv's lesbian parole officer, Lucille.<br/><br/>In ""The Big Fat Kill,"" corrupt cop Jackie Boy (Benicio Del Toro) is about to break down the door of his stripper lover Shellie (Brittany Murphy). What Jackie Boy doesn't know, is Shellie has a new man in her life, and that man is Dwight (Clive Owen). Dwight is a wanted murderer who underwent plastic surgery and has found unlikely love with the hardened Shellie. Well, to make long stories short, all hell breaks loose when Jackie Boy and his lackeys wander into the wrong part of town and are killed by chop-soki swordswoman Miho (Devon Aoki).<br/><br/>In this part of the city, known as Old Town, the whores are their own enforcers as they have an uneasy truce with the corrupt police. But with Jackie Boy and his loser friends getting wasted, that truce has gone bye-bye. Gail (the luscious, the leather-and-chain-bound Rosario Dawson) is the leader, and Dwight formulates a plan to dump the bodies into the distant tar pits. But between getting there, narrowly evading the cops (including Michael Clarke Duncan) and assorted foreign mercenaries and his own stupidity, each of these almost prove to be Dwight's undoing.<br/><br/>Oh, wow, where to begin. For starters, Rosario Dawson!!! I never knew this woman could look so hot in S&M, not that I'm into that sort of thing, but damn, I at least partially bought this just to see her in leather and chains. As Dwight, Clive Owen hits all the right notes as an outsider anti-hero in way over his head, and Devon Aoki is pretty vicious as Miho, who serves up some delectable sushi bad guys with the same swords used in the ""Kill Bill"" films. But ""The Big Fat Kill"" is big, bloody, and fun.<br/><br/>""That Yellow Bastard"" is the only one of the three I haven't read (not that it really matters), so I have to go on what the movie says. The yellow bastard in question is an unrecognizable Nick Stahl as Roark Jr., the psychopathic son of Senator Roark (Powers Boothe). He's racked up a nasty reputation on the Basin City streets as a vicious serial killer who loves to torture women, and his latest target is stripper Nancy Callahan (Jessica Alba). Hartigan (Bruce Willis), one of the only honest cops left in the city, has a bad heart and little patience for incompetence, which only intensifies when he is stopped by his partner Bob (Michael Madsen) from killing Roark Jr. and is then sentenced to a lengthy prison term. Hartigan escapes, and then goes after Roark Jr., who is setting his sights once again on the innocent Nancy.<br/><br/>""Sin City"" is already one of the most talked-about films this year. It's definitely not for the faint-of-heart, as the stylized and incredibly bloody violence should ruffle a few feathers. The numerous unsavory characters are truly right out of a comic book, as they make no attempt to rise above their amoral existences in Miller's decadent Basin City.<br/><br/>There are few heroes in ""Sin City"" and there are even fewer identifiable characters, but there's no two ways about it: ""Sin City"" is a visual masterpiece, a pumped-up comic book come to life on steroids, and is one of the best movies I've seen this year.<br/><br/>10/10"
"Shippey","8","335","559","16 March 2005"," Hyper-Noir for today
","I just came back from an advance screening of Sin City, and I can tell you this is one salient reel of pitch of a film. Think of it as film noir amped up for a post modern century. It comes across like most of Frank Miller's writing, modestly fantastic for the comic environment, but steeped long and hard in the tradition of the underground crime writers of the '40's. Visually, the juxtaposition of the rich B&W with digitally-hued Technicolor makes it hard to take your eyes off the screen. This film was tailor made for most of the people who have been following Miller's writing for the past twenty odd years, brimming with many of his trademark elements and visual style that he, along with Messrs. Rodriguez and Tarantino, capture brilliantly. Not for more sensitive or under aged souls, Sin City will burn like a fire that you have to watch for everyone else."
"dogankurban","10","14","18","8 February 2009"," Excellent movie
","The movie is really great. Especially the thing about colors. The movie is black and white but somethings like the red dress, blue eyes of Alexis Bledel are colored, which i find very original. Also i realized that on the dancing scene in which Jessica Alba and Bruce Wills meet at the bar, the whole movie becomes colored. Even the least important roles are taken by very famous actors and actresses and the acting is very solid throughout the movie. When you combine all these with frank miller's excellent scenario, one of the best movies ever is the result. I think that this movie deserves a higher rank in the top250 movies list."
"mstomaso","7","156","259","18 June 2005"," Miller's art realized in fast paced nice film noir tribute.
","I'll put my bottom line at the top so you can decide whether to read on. I can't recommend this film to the average cinema-goer. Instead, I will recommend it to those who are fans of Frank Miller, film noir, Robert Rodrigues, and to a lesser extent Quentin Tarantino. This is also not a film for feminists. Others should read on and decide if this is something they want to see. <br/><br/>The fact that Frank Miller was listed with Robert Rodriquez as co-director of this film, and the cleverly ambiguous film noir trailer hooked me. So, the spouse and I went to see it shortly after release, expecting exactly what we got - a very cleverly and interestingly shot film noir version of several Frank Miller stories taking place in Basin City, the locus of Miller's graphic novels of the same name as the film. <br/><br/>Quentin Tarantino guest directs one of the segments. I'm not sure which - Rodrigues' style is as often violent, but a bit more comic. Based on some of the ridiculous violence of the film, I think it likely that QT had some influence on the other segments as well. My only objection to this film is really the quantity of absurd and frankly grotesque violence scenes. Though the violence is true to Miller's work, seeing it as a process creates a very different effect than Miller's art. Fortunately, Rodrigues' sense of humor also prevails in most of the most violent scenes. The use of colorization emphasizes the film's bloodiness through the only colors used in the film - red, ultra-white and yellow - comic exaggeration and a wonderfully eerie noir feel. <br/><br/>Predictably, this is a very dark film, and quite a bit more disturbing than the average commercial stuff. <br/><br/>What the spouse and I didn't expect was pleasantly surprising - one of the most artistically well done interpretations of the comic medium I have yet seen (and I have seen them all) and stand-out performances by Del Toro, Mickey Rourke and Willis. I expect nothing less from Del Toro, but I have to admit Rourke just blew me away as Miller's phenomenally ugly and invincible tough guy - Marv - who decides, for once, to do something good with his life. Rourke's character is played with such empathy that you won't want his segments to end - you will want him to become the final hero of the film. I was less enchanted with Clive Owen's portrayal of Dwight. Though this segment was good entertainment, I thought Owen could have given a more emotive performance. Elijah Wood was exceptionally creepy and well cast in his very brief role.<br/><br/>All of the heroic male characters (and this film is VERY much filmed from a stereotype film noir male point of view) have one common characteristic - they are all very tough critters fighting against all odds against endemic corruption, murder and injustice, but not at all afraid to indulge in it to further their own ends. The vignettes are loosely but satisfactorily connected. But the plots are less important than the way the film FEELS. The film mixes hopelessness with fearlessness and fatalism to the extent that you'll feel like an honorable death ending a brief life is far more appealing than a lengthy life devoid of self-respect. It's a really well done homage to Comic Book as an art form, and the film noir motif. Whoever thought of putting Rodriguez and Miller together on this one deserves a nod from fans of both genres."

","Well before I left the theater, the first time I watched Sin City, I knew it was going to be one of my favorite movies, ever. It's one of the rare movies that I went to the theater to see multiple times, forcefully dragging along any of my friends who hadn't seen it (and the smart ones who already had). It's just that good. It's the best film ever based on comic books or graphic novels, and I doubt that will ever change (until Sin City 2, that is). <br/><br/>Robert Rodriguez realized that the source material was basically perfect, all he had to do was get the cinematography and casting right. And he succeeded brilliantly. The nearly frame-for-frame creation of the comic panels works so well, because there's nothing really that could have been added to improve what was on the page. And the sheer amount of great actors and actresses collected here is impressive, to say the least. They embody the characters without overwhelming them.<br/><br/>This isn't the perfect movie for everyone, but I don't see how it could disappoint anyone who is familiar with the novels, a fan of Miller's style, or anyone who enjoys a dark, funny, and stylish action movie. I love it from the very first scene to the very last. Which is great, because I'm sure I'll have watched it at least 20 more times, before a sequel gets made."

Splashes of color, to give CPR to a very old style of film-making. Though this film is not for everyone, I have to say that all will agree that SIN CITY gives all new depth to movies that are made from comics.<br/><br/>I honestly found no flaws with this movie. I gave it 10 for honest reasons. Acting and directing melds together to create a film with breath-taking ""color"".

"Chrysanthepop","Null","11","14","23 November 2007"," Sinsational Comic Book Comes To Life
","'Sin City' is a fantastic and very stunningly accurate adaptation of Frank Miller's comic book series. Rodriguez and Miller wonderfully bring out the essence of the very graphic books. Though it is told in a 'Pulp Fiction' type, non-chronological manner, it keeps one amazed and makes full use of CGI. The editing makes it slick while the cinematography brilliantly adds to the haunting gory atmosphere. Colour is both effectively and minimally used as it further gives a comic book noire feel. 'Sin City' is filled with guns, blood, babes, murder, sickness and so many kinds of danger.<br/><br/>While the cast is very impressive as most of the actors blend into the characters well enough, Willis isn't convincing as a 70 year old and he seems to be a little too popular which makes him the odd one out. While many praise Elijah Wood's performance, I fail to see anything remarkable. Throughout the whole film, all the actor does is sport the same expressionless look. That may have been all the character required but then it didn't require much acting and a lot of special effects was put into it. Hartnett does not seem to convince as the Salesman, particularly when he's using his charm (which Hartnett lacks). Roarke is superb and hardly recognizable. Owen and del Toro provide some of the best moments. Stahl is quite adequate. Hauer and Booth are menacing. The women hold their own and all of them do great. Dawson is particularly effective as the dominatrix/godmother while Gugino, Alba, King and Murphy are very good and Bledel and Gugino are particularly stunning to look at.<br/><br/>Though 'Sin City' has been claimed to be a guy film, I don't see why women cannot enjoy it. Yes, most of the women in 'Sin City' are prostitutes but these women are just as powerful as the men and they defend their own territory, their own kind. They are not portrayed only as mere sex objects, mind you.<br/><br/>Everything finely fits together in 'Sin City'. It's Rodriguez's best work to date. Everyone involved in the making should be commended for their effort that's wonderfully paid off. It's certainly not a film to sit down with the family (Yes, it's deservedly and strongly rated 'R') but a great watch with friends or otherwise. I'm eagerly awaiting the next installments of 'Sin City' and hope to catch it on the big screen this time."
"dbborroughs","1","250","443","10 April 2005"," Laughably Bad, but Perfect Comic Adaptation
","This is a perfect adaptation of several of Frank Miller's Sin City stories. Filmed to look exactly precisely like the panels of the comic book where everything is BLACK or WHITE except for the occasional red, blue, or yellow, exactly like in the comic. The dialog is lifted word for word from the comic and sold in noir-ish tones we associate with the genre.<br/><br/>After five minutes you quickly realize that its all visual form over substance, and that there is little behind the trick of exact duplication. <br/><br/>The narration, like much of the narration in the pulp novels its paying homage to, is purple and laughable when spoken out loud. The dialog is equally ludicrous. None of it even remotely real. I was in fits of uncontrolled laughter as the ""serious"" lines of prose were spewed out over mostly unremarkable images.I know there is a tinge of humor to the source but on screen it comes off as something to laugh AT not with. <br/><br/>Yes, it all matches the comic exactly, but to what end? What is the purpose of this exactitude? Wouldn't it have been better to simply film the panels and have the actors speak the lines? Its all little more than a live action Clutch Cargo since there is no life on screen in what is little more than posed actors recreating the static shots of the comic. This is a ground breaking visual style? <br/><br/>Many people in discussing the film have mentioned the violence and how ""if it had been in color"" it would have been unbearable. I think it would have looked equally silly. Actually most of this movie would have looked very silly and dumb in color.<br/><br/>The performances, especially Mickey Rourke as Marv (Oscar nom?)are excellent, but they are saddled with such unreal material that their earnestness comes off making it all look even more ridiculous.<br/><br/>This is simply one of the most over-hyped films in many years. Its a live action comic book for people who've forgotten how to read."
"oshram-3","1","140","249","3 April 2005"," Reprehensible piece of trash
","Sin City is a film geek's dream, all style and violence, an homage not only to the comics that spawned them but to Tarantino-esque gore and violence; it's even shot in black and white, features 'edgy' story material, anti-heroes, and gratuitous amounts of attractive female flesh. I'm sure the internet film geeks have already erected a shrine to this film. But unlike them, I have not come to praise Miller (or really Rodriguez), but to bury him.<br/><br/>Rodriguez does, in fact, manage the near impossible feat of capturing Miller's noir style in an interesting way. I was worried that what worked for the comics wouldn't work for the movies, but Rodriguez pulls it off. Sin City looks like its graphic antecedents, and the sparse use of spot color echoes Miller's style and carries much of the same impact. While Miller's people rarely resemble real humans any more (except the always curvaceous women), I felt most of the casting was good too. Mickey Rourke is hidden behind a thick layer of prosthetics as one of the main characters, Marv, but it somehow actually works in the film. I think probably I liked Bruce Willis' Hartigan the best, but then I liked his story arc the most as well.<br/><br/>The problem, sadly, is not with the visuals, where I thought it would be. The problem isn't even with the storytelling  although the narrative voices of the characters are so monotonous and so similar that you more or less lose track of who's doing what to who because they all speak with the same burned-out hard-ass gravelly self-deprecating voice. The problem is simply that the shorthand Miller used in the comics does not translate well to the screen, at all. Sin City on the page is a violent, dirty place, and it is so in the movie; but the insanely high level of sadism is far less shocking on the page than it is on the screen. Sin City plays like a two hour seminar in violence desensitization; every single imaginable physical cruelty  from eye-gouging to castration, from severed limbs to bullwhipping, to a lot, lot more  is played out in stark black and white. As if that weren't bad enough  and if you think it's not, you have bigger issues than I do, friend  what makes it even worse is that the film revels in the violence. In the comics, when these lunks go off to commit their mayhem, while they throw themselves into it, there's always an undertow of regret to it, of resignation, of knowing what they do damns them. But here, the committing of acts of unspeakable violence somehow seem to justify and redeem the characters; the more disgusting things you do in the name of revenge, the greater a hero you are. I cannot think of a single message more repugnant or reprehensible to send.<br/><br/>To me Sin City, while perhaps an interesting visual exercise (though honestly I wasn't that captivated), is little more than an excuse to show blood and boobs for two hours. I could get the same thing with a little less style (and maybe Joan Severance instead of Jessica Alba) from a direct-to-video shlocker that at least knew it was a borderline snuff film and didn't have the pretensions to art. Sin City is two hours of repetitive, relentless sadism, wrapped up in an artsy package. With all that talent, with all the effort and work (and it's there), it's a shame they managed to miss the underlying message in all of Miller's comics  that the descent into this lifestyle can only end one way, and it's not good. The very heart, as it were, of Miller's message in the books, completely missing from the film. Rodriguez got all the trappings right, he just sort of missed the point. But so, then, did most of the fans."

","If you're interested in how comics are translated to film in an innovative way, check out 'American Splendor' and 'The Hulk'. If you're interested in film noir, check out 'Blade Runner' and 'Angel Heart'. If you're interested in black-and-white movies with some color here and there, check out 'Rumble Fish'. If you're interested in time-warped storytelling, check out 'Pulp Fiction'. If you're interested in blood and gore, check out 'Braindead'.<br/><br/>All of the movies mentioned above are more original than Sin City. Moreover, Sin City is just an accumulation of all the clichés invented in the films above, and by extension all Hollywood films since 'A Wonderful Life'.<br/><br/>I saw this film and I couldn't help but wonder about the American people. One comment on this board read 'the violence is cartoony so it's not too disturbing, but there is some nudity so leave the kids at home'. In other words, it's okay to watch heads get mutilated, decapitated, and blown up - but it's not okay to watch a naked human being. I'm seriously wondering why people feel killing - termination of life - is OK to show to kids but sex, the creation of life, is not.<br/><br/>When I saw 'Kill Bill' I was already quite intrigued that the director could shoot such beautiful images and yet only uses them for showing violence and murder. I saw the same film again with 'Sin City' - only this time it wasn't a pastiche of martial arts clichés, it was a pastiche of martial arts, film noir, and comic clichés. This left me highly unimpressed with beautiful imagery or supposedly surprising plot details. Actually, I've noticed that when the audience cracks up over inventive killing or mutilation, it's often a nervous reaction which people confuse for humor. <br/><br/>Oh man, I've seen to many of these vengeance films. Why does the bad guy always need to die? Why does the hero always need to place himself above the law? Why does anybody feel the need these days to make yet another movie about a guy killing all the baddies for a girl? The latter actually happens three times in this movie. This is all getting so old. I literally yawned when 'the mob' was introduced, and when we got a scene closer comprising of a zoom on a tough guy with his voice-over saying 'the big fat killing', I decided I'd look up my old IMDb user name. <br/><br/>Avoid this one. See original films, instead. Life is short."

"asherblack","1","114","219","11 April 2005"," In Sin City, gore and brutality are an end in themselves.
","To speak against violence in film is bound to earn me the status 'unenlightened' or 'moralistic'. Nonetheless, it is not violence that is the target of my criticism, but rather the glorification of violence for its own sake. For example, the violence in Fight Club, while sometimes intense, is explored as a means of finding release. The gore in Luc Besson's The Messenger is actually discussed in the film, critiqued as part of the brutality of war.<br/><br/>In Sin City, however, gore and brutality become an end in themselves. The film offers up a nihilistic world in which desensitized youth living a vicarious viciousness through comics and video games can legitimize their perversions in the name of fidelity to the original. A few key points in the film serve to illustrate:  In one scene a woman explains, as she holds up the grisly, sewn-up stump where a serial killer has severed her hand, that he made her watch as he ate it.<br/><br/> In another, the antihero Marv has sawn off the arms and legs of the bound serial killer, and lures a wild dog to tear at his flesh and eat him alive. This is one of several scenes of torture that Marv says he enjoys.<br/><br/> In still another scene, which could have been right out of Kill Bill, the focus is on how much brutality the prostitutes could inflict. The pretense is to talk of skill at swordplay, but this only underscores how much the visual emphasis was on the damage being inflicted.<br/><br/> In a later scene, the hero Hartigan beats in the face of a psychopath until it is a liquid pulp.<br/><br/>One can pretend the morality of torture, terrorism, killing sprees, and savagery by claiming the victims deserved it, or harp on the fact that the film mirrors the comic book, but those are certainly non sequiturs. Even it's more perceptive fans see it, though they may choose to call it ""terrifically violent"" or ""ultraviolent"" ""Sin City has more severed heads, dismemberment's and acts of cannibalism than The Silence of the Lambs and Freddy vs. Jason put together. I loved it!"" -- Staci Layne Wilson, HORROR.COM The film caters to the most heartless inclinations of its audience. As an interaction between art, artist, and audience, we can see the animator spending more camera time and dialogue on the gore and the nihilism justifying it than anything else, while the audience oohs, ahs, cheers, and laughs at precisely the calculated moments.<br/><br/>The film is a commentary on the ethical state of the West, as much as on Frank Miller's original work. The people that can justify terror in the name of terror, bombing villages and hospitals out of revenge, has created a generation that doesn't flinch at amputation, but sees human suffering as on a par with baiting a hook. It is a culture that is broken, that lacks some fundamental elements of mercy, compassion, and empathy that would otherwise typify humanity.<br/><br/>True, the film is fiction. But fiction mirrors life. Art offers us possible worlds that we can envision as real, and our reactions to those worlds are less predicated on the fact that they are fictional than on the actual values of the audience. If not, we must ask why the audience is actually cheering and clapping so enthusiastically.<br/><br/>In the end, the ethos of the film is the ethos of the audience, and the posturing about brilliant cinematography is a confession that there is actually something of which normal people should be ashamed.<br/><br/>Just as The Passion reflects the West's obsession with the cruelty inflicted on Christ, so Sin City is an example of its passion for precisely that cruelty. It has become trite to say that we are the culture of the Roman Arena, the spectacle of suffering, the carnival of gore. Trite, not because it isn't true, but precisely because it is  because the fact of it is even more commonplace than the observation."
"ddelarama","Null","7","9","9 April 2005"," A Review of Frank Miller's Sin City
","Just recently Frank Miller's noir-inspired brainchild Sin City made its way into US cinema, opening with a bang. While this film clearly takes a bite out of the apple that is comics making its way to film, this film is a clear cut above the rest. I must say, Sin City is the most faithful rendition of work travailing to the big screen among others. The movie is uncharacteristically mature, witty, and human. Sure, bring out the big guns (the cleavage) to spice up the flick, one might say. But amidst the bosom-enriched characters, these characters are not your stereotypical cardboard cutouts; they are alive. Scenes were faithfully lifted out of the three graphic novels, and what you see in the comic books is what you see in the film. As if one reading the thoughts of the main characters in a comic book, the protagonists in the film literally speaks their mindHamlet soliloquies of sorts. Faithfully leaving the mutilation, decapitation, castrations, et cetera, alone in the transition. And this move has worked perfectly. Not to mention the seamless integration of CG, film noir inspiration, A-list acting worthy of Hollywood big names, and pop influences of director Quentin Tarantino.<br/><br/>Sin City is a movie about Basin City and everything in it. Basin city is a place of eternal rain where corruption reeks, where day is night and night is black and white. The mayor is a corrupt politician whose son Rourk Jr. (Stahl; also the Yellow Bastard) is a pedophile. Majority of the cops work hand in hand with criminals, helping each other to eliminate the prostitutes, also one of the more powerful groups. Even the almighty church wields corruption to the fullest; the cardinal being the mayor's brother. And unholy alliances make (or break) the control of power in this god-forsaken dystopia.<br/><br/>The movie features three story lines, clearly Tarantino-inspired: that of Marv (Rourke), (Owen), and Hartigan (Willis). First, Marv is a literal powerhouse whose one true love, Goldie (King), is murdered by an assassin sent by God knows who, and he is bent on seeking revenge. His personal vendetta finally brings him to the assassin (Wood), a cannibal as nimble as a cat and as disturbing as the masked crowd in Kubrick's Eyes Wide Shut. In the second story, Brittany Murphy plays Dwight's (Owen) girlfriend, who also happens to be Jackie Boy's (del Toro) ex-girlfriend. Jackie Boy is a corrupt cop whose mere presence disrupts the balance of power between the cops, gangs, and the prostitutes; Dwight vows to kill him and is brought to the underground world of his other girlfriend Gail (Dawson) and her band of prostitutes, a force to be reckoned with. While only directing one scene in the entire movie, and the funniest one at that (it's the car scene), we clearly see the influence of Tarantino's Kill Bill character, the Bride, in Aoki's character Miho. Cooler or not, I leave that up to you. The third story focuses on Hartigan. Hartigan vowed to protect Nancy (Alba) from the mayor's pedophile son, who later transforms to become the Yellow Bastard, and a you-take-something-from-me-I-take-something-from-you cat-and-mouse game ensues.<br/><br/>Another reason why the movie is different is because it's in black and white, believe it or not. Well, mostly black and white. They left some elements colored, and with vibrant detail, I may add, such as the red dress in the opening scene, or the red heart shaped bed, or the Yellow Bastard (hence the name Yellow), just like in the comics. CG meshed seamlessly with everything corporeal, like Sky Captain but better. Acting was surprisingly powerful for most of the characters. Rourke portrayed Marv with vigor and enthusiasm, humor and wit, and his character almost reminded me of Hamlet. Well, all three protagonists did, anyway. Owen, for some reason, reminded me of a literal dark knight (not Batman) in messy armor. Willis, while having little chemistry (or lack thereof) with Alba, managed to deliver. And while relegated to the beginning and ending only, Josh Hartnett was cool, for a change.<br/><br/>I always wished that Hollywood does something different for a change. And they did. Wonderfully. This flick is a testament to that."
"Red_Identity","Null","3","3","9 March 2009"," The one and only Masterpiece of the comic book genre!
","Sin City is based on three different stories in a place called Basin City. The way the three stories unfold and collapse against one another is captivating to see. Based on the graphic novels by Frank Miller, Sin City is perhaps the first film ever made to really have the authentic tone and look of comic books. Even if you have not seen the film, you probably had heard of this film for it's original style and unique touch of black-and-white special effects. I thought this was one heck of a movie. I thought this was one of the few films to actually have a really powerful narration, which is done by the three main characters played by Mickey Rourke, Clive Owen, and Bruce Willis. I thought the first third with Marv(Mickey Rourke) was one amazing story. I loved the beginning, and I loved this story the best out of the whole film. The second story which focuses on Dwight(Clive Owen) was to an extent different, although the same menacing feel is still there. Whereas Marv's story relied more on suspense and mystery, this part was more action-packed, which had really amazing uses of violence and gore. The third and final act, about Hardigan(Bruce Willis) was more similar to Marv's story, and also had the right use of violence, mystery, and action. I thought the ensemble cast was certainly one to marvel at. There are a lot of movie stars in this film, and some of them are brilliant, whereas some of them not so much. I thought Mickey Rourke, Bruce Willis, Rosario Dawson, Elijah Wood, and Benicio Del Toro were the best of the film. They all delivered their best. Especially Benicio Del Toro, who really gave us a creepy and menacing villain. There were others who were not as great. Clive Owen was mixed. In some parts he was great, in others he seemed so dull. Alexis Bledel, Jaime King, and Jessica Alba also had some good parts, but in others they were all sort of bland or bad. But the biggest problem was Brittany Murphy. I thought Murphy was just horrible. In her only scene, she was just talking and acting so mediocre, did not like her one bit. I have seen her in other films, and I thought she was a good actress. Maybe something happened with her here, but she was by far the worst. The writing is also something to appreciate. It was cheesy in parts, but I thought everything, from the dialogue to the events, were all done as they would in a comic book, or in this case graphic novel. I especially liked the imagery and figurative dialogue and the narration that was used, and really enhanced the film to another level.<br/><br/>Overall, Sin City is one of the most ambitious, original, entertaining, captivating, action packed, visually stunning and artistically magnificent films I have ever had the pleasure of watching. I expect a lot of repeat viewings, and action films had never gotten better than this. A one and only film that needs to be watched, even if only for for its incredible style and ambitious craft."

","In Sin City nobody is innocent, not even the Bishop, and they are going to pay for that.<br/><br/>The movie is based, both the story and aesthetics, in the noir comic by Frank Miller, who is also co-director of the film,together with Robert Rodriguez; Quentin Tarantino was invited to direct one of the scenes. The movie intertwines four different stories, whose characters will cross paths at certain point: The Customer Is Always Right, The Hard Goodbye, The Big Fat Kill, and That Yellow Bastard The movie is visually stunning and stylish. It looks and feels like a real noir comic, with camera framing and positioning typical of comic vignettes, as well as the use of high contrast B&W and chiaroscuro. The movie has wonderful black, white and sepia tones with cutout reds and bright colors, a technique widely used in Photography and drawing, but never used in movies before. The movie was completely shot using green backgrounds.<br/><br/>The movie is heart-attack paced, with no a moment of dullness or rest. However, is not for the heart faint, as it is extremely violent and gory, very hard to watch sometimes. The fact that those being punished deserve it, does not make the violence easier to swallow.<br/><br/>The characters are never dull, very human - never good or bad, but both things. Moreover, they are at very melancholic types, funny and merciless.<br/><br/>The movie delights the viewer with terrific performances by a large group of A-listed actors. However, Mickey Rourke, Bruce Willis, Benicio Del Toro, Clive Owen and Rosario Dawson really shine through. Jessica Alba and Elija Wood, who are usually a bore, are terrific in their respective roles, too.<br/><br/>The best comic adaptation I have ever seen.<br/><br/>Entertainment and quality together.

"random_avenger","9","5","6","12 August 2010"," Sin City
","Many movies based on comic books (or graphic novels, if you insist) have been somewhat lackluster, but Sin City certainly delivers what it promises. The episodic film consists of four partly intertwining stories, each having different emphases even if they look superficially similar. The film opens and closes with an enigmatic hit-man (Josh Hartnett) taking care of his customers. The second and penultimate story arcs recount the fate of a somewhat honest cop Hartigan (Bruce Willis) who saves a young girl from a pedophile, but sees no justice being made. The next story is about Marv (Mickey Rourke), a big and gruff man of the streets who avows to avenge the death of a hooker he once briefly loved. The remaining story deals with Dwight (Clive Owen) who gets in trouble with the police while protecting his girlfriend and has to resort to the help of the vigilante prostitutes of a special region of the city.<br/><br/>In Sin City everything is exaggerated: the starkly contrasted black & white cinematography, the sparse but powerful use of colour, the pulpily poetic narration and the caricature-like characters. On the one hand it's awesome, kick-ass and all that, but on the other hand it is also distressing, overwhelmingly devoid of hope and even disgusting in spite of the over-the-top comical coolness it oozes. Especially Marv's story carries a sense of gruesome beauty in his devotion to the memory of the dead whore and his antagonist, a silent cannibal killer Kevin (Elijah Wood), is extremely creepy in his cold enjoyment of his fate – there are no signs of Frodo Baggins to be seen here. If Marv's story is the most dramatic, the Dwight one is the most comedic and provides more of the kick-ass type of action. It's all good, but I don't think the impact is as great as with Marv.<br/><br/>Hartigan's story is decent too and conveys the sense of isolation and diminishing hope within the bars of Hartigan's cramped solitary confinement cell. His antagonist, the literally Yellow Bastard (Nick Stahl), is rather overblown but who isn't, in Sin City? The hanging scene particularly (and literally) captures the feel of suffocation in the world where hope is a luxury. In contrast with the other stories, the Hit-man tale with Josh Hartnett bookending the film remains the shortest and the most enigmatic. Very little is revealed about the hit-man and he himself admits he doesn't know the reasons for the violence, but at the same time it comes out so naturally that avoiding it is not an option.<br/><br/>The constant, even ridiculous exaggerating of the cruel nature of Sin City could have been just a funny action movie or a laughably heavy-handed overstatement of Man's nature, but I think it works both as an actioner and an emotionally draining experience. If the viewer allows himself or herself be sucked into the world of Marv or Hartigan while looking beyond the obvious and intentional silliness, there's beauty to be found. It may not be very subtly or exquisitely presented, but in my opinion the pieces really fall into place here and everything makes sense – Sin City can only be strongly recommended."

I admired what computers can do in the hands of visual artists. Some of the images where out of a Gustav Dorè of the future, I mean the present. A Dorè with sudden bursts of red the reddest red you've ever seen. I must confess I was very unfamiliar with the comic ""Sin City"" is based on. A male fantasy of the first order. Blood, guts, huge guns and fabulous babes. The almost adolescent Jessica Alba throws herself in the arms of Bruce Willis, promising eternal love. Willis, by the way, is terrific so is Clive Owen. My God what a face! A heroic movie icon for the ages. Mickey Rourke picks up where he left off, deformed, full of blood and moving, very moving in a chilling kind of way. I didn't recognize Benicio del Toro until it was too late. Rosario Dawson, Brittany Murphy and the afore mentioned Jessica Alba are nothing short of spectacular. To boot Josh Harnett appears as beautifully creepy bookends. And yet, I was left with a sense of frustration. I was in the mood for a movie and found myself in a theme park ride.

","I read the three full books from where the stories for this were taken before I first saw this at the cinema. I was thrilled beyond words by it then, and it still has that effect on me. This is probably best classified as noir(and my how they hit the nail on the head in how they do such a genre piece) with a shot of adrenaline. It is also the way to do a direct adaptation. Characters perfectly brought to life by a cast laced with star actors, all of whom hand in amazing performances. The tone fits that of the original material. And last, but not least, perhaps even most important: it is copied pretty much straight from the source. Frank was present during production and with Robert they put almost all of the comics on the screen. With the former's strong writing and the latter's knack for energetic direction, it's a recipe for success, and they do not let us down. The plot evolves nicely throughout, and is interesting for the entire running time. The pacing is spot-on, never letting you get bored, nor overwhelming you, in spite of the amount of cool stuff. The action, plain and simple, is awesome. There's a ton of it, and it's all well-achieved. The cinematography and editing are masterful. The humor, much of which is quite black, is great. Rodriguez throws in some of his cartoon-like bits, and they work. The score and music is all magnificent. The script is immensely well-written, and the lines are so memorable and quotable it's not even funny. There are some mighty violent and disturbing images herein, and unless you're certain you can take it, you may want to consider sitting this one out. There is also a good deal of nudity and sexuality, albeit it has been cut down considerably from the pages. There is rather little language, and what there is tends to be relatively mild. It doesn't feel restrained, in my opinion. You have to admire the guts and integrity it took to make this... anti-heroes and darkness aren't always received kindly by the masses. Among the DVD releases for this, there is the Special 2-Disc Edition... if you want my advice, I'd say to get that, if you're buying a copy of this. There are several featurettes, two audio commentary tracks(one with Miller, where Willis also briefly dips in, and one with Quentin Tarantino, and RR is on both), another audio track which is of an audience reaction(and they're all listen-worthy), and the extended cut adds some(although it isn't many minutes) of what was cut from the Theatrical(do also note that it splits the segments back up into separate ones), in addition to featuring that version, as well. The FAQ goes into more detail about exactly what is found of extras, as well as what footage remains missing. I recommend this to any fan of the graphic novels, Frank Miller and/or Robert Rodriguez. 10/10"

Every single aspect of the movie was purely creative, so even if you are skeptical going in, you can still appreciate the work of art that it is. All of the backgrounds are computer generated. The movie is, for the most part, in black and white. (With the occasional exception of certain things, like lips or eyes, etc.) The soundtrack is quite appropriate, and was done by Rodriguez himself. (What can't this guy do?) Unlike it's Miller counterpart, Elektra, there was an actual plot backed up by great acting. The story I found the best (it revolves basically around three) was Mickey Rourke's-- who was also my favorite character from the film because of his ""man on a mission"" attitude.<br/><br/>I'm curious to know what fans of Miller's series of graphic novels will think, as far as it being what they have hoped for/expected, but for me, this movie was dynamite."

The quality is impeccable, and it moves at a good rate.... However...<br/><br/>Both my wife and I got progressively more uncomfortable as the film went on. The violence slowly got more and more sadistic and graphic, and seemed to be a celebration of torture, mutilation and pain.<br/><br/>Women were reduced to their component parts, and tokenistic ""sassiness"" given to their characters to disguise the fact they were pure eye-candy for the male element of the audience.<br/><br/>We didn't care about the characters. There were no differences. The 'hero' liked to dismember villains, and get dogs to eat them whilst still alive. I'm not sure why this was OK, or any different to what the villains were doing.<br/><br/>What was this movie about? 2 hours of what could be the greatest guide ever for serial killers to keep their interest piqued? I think the purpose of this movie was to make us realise the world we live in. If you step back from the stylish production, and the white comic book blood, the content and message is very cold and dehumanising.<br/><br/>Neither my wife or I finished watching the film, and both felt angry that we had wasted as much time as we did watching someone else's nasty fantasy.<br/><br/>The only thing that disturbed me more than the film was the fact that people I like recommended it to me with no mention of the violence.

","I feel sorry for those familiar with the graphic novels from whence the stories and framing come. They are likely to take Rodriguez at his word that this is merely a ""translation."" I suppose you can believe that and that alone and still enjoy this.<br/><br/>But I am much luckier in that I can take this on its merits as a film, with decisions that are made because it is a film. After all, much of the art here is the selection of just which stories are used, how they are woven together and what the rhythm of the thing is. None of that came from Miller.<br/><br/>For background, you need to know that one of the three great inventions of cinema is the notion of noir, that particular framing of narrative where the very act of watching creates a cosmology that neither belongs to the world of the watcher, nor the characters but which tortures both by arranging coincidences. All these coincidences include the coincidence that you the viewer happen to be there together with the narrator. <br/><br/>The act of watching transmutes the vision into something you'd see, in well... a comic book.<br/><br/>In this case we have noir become cinema, become the genre of ""graphic novel"" become a specific movie that in its collage is neonoir.<br/><br/>That collage is three stories in a wrapper: Willis is a convict, framed by Senator Roark protecting his son, who protects a stripper; Rourke (the actor) is a convict, framed by Cardinal Roark protecting his adopted son, who gets revenge for the death of a prostitute (and is protecting other prostitutes); Owen is a convict targeted by Roark, protecting a whole society of prostitutes. Each has a hospital stay.<br/><br/>These stories cross at several points as if they were independent threads in the same city. But wait. In neonoir, we have folds that the noir of the forties didn't have. That means that to some extent these stories all collapse into one. And yes, all three main characters (not counting the salesman who is our surrogate) hallucinate to such an extent that they could be imagining their situation into the other story.<br/><br/>In other words, each of the three stories contains a ""dream sequence"" which is the others, each within themselves, and all within the bar. The wrapper is the salesman who seduces us, selling us one thing and slyly slipping in another.<br/><br/>It must be hell to be a filmmaker with a flood of ideas, the digital means to make many of them happen and have no story to animate. Miller's stuff is just an excuse  a passable one  for the real artistry here. If Rodriguez makes three of these (as we expect), let's hope he tinkers with the idea as much as he did with the spy kids and desperado notions.<br/><br/>Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching."

","Sin City is Frank Miller's ""Sin City"" comic book brought to life by the directorial magic of Robert Rodriguez with the able assistance of co-director Frank Miller and special guest director Quentin Tarantino.<br/><br/>Packed with hot young Hollywood talent (Rosario Dawson, Jessica Alba, Brittany Murphy) and cagey old acting vets (Bruce Willis, Rutger Hauer, Mickey Rourke) the movie is a technical and visual tour de force that has been described as the best adaption of a comic book to grace the silver screen. And actually, it is... the movie is a living comic book from the dialogue to the look of the characters to the camera-work. ""Sin City"" is also shot mainly in black and white, adding considerably to the feel and the atmosphere of the movie, which is best described as grim, gritty, violent, sadistic and slightly misogynistic.<br/><br/>And it's this atmosphere that causes me to question ""Sin City"". It's no accident that Tarantino is associated with this project since ""Sin City"" and the comic book its based on are the children of the pulp movie genre which Tarantino popularized with ""Reservoir Dogs"", ""Pulp Fiction"" and the ""Kill Bill"" series. And this leads me to ask: how much sadistic violence is enough? I like flying body parts and savage beatings as much as the next film-goer but I'm starting to get tired of it because every new ""edgy"" ""pulpy"" ""gritty"" movie now has the same elements. The shocking graphic violence, the tough guy characters and the hard boiled dialogue which once was fresh and new has been reduced to worn out clichés.<br/><br/>Not to mention the misogyny running through ""Sin City"". In one scene the movie shows a wall full of chopped off women's heads displayed as trophies. Sure, it can be viewed as part of the story but what exactly are the filmmakers trying to say? What purpose does the scene serve? Its just shock for the sake of shock. Also, the women in the movie are depicted as whores, strippers, or helpless victims. Again, its part of the movie world but what point are the directors trying to make?<br/><br/>Perhaps I'm jaded, but having watched more than a few of these types of movies I'm now waiting for a director to take the Tarantino formula into a new direction. With ""Sin City"" the genre has completely been played out, there's nothing new story wise and we're treated to variations of the same old characters we've seen before. Ultimately, the only distinguishing feature of ""Sin City"" is the visual style of the movie. Is it enough? Maybe, but not to me. It would be cool to see something new in terms of character development or story once in awhile."

"Steven Reynolds","5","35","67","31 July 2005"," Technically interesting, but no heart
","Three stories from Frank Miller's celebrated series of graphic novels are loosely intertwined here in what is undoubtedly a highly personal project for director Robert Rodriguez and co-director Miller. The film certainly captures the visceral nature of Miller's work, with its curious focus on genital mutilation and dismemberment (but is surprisingly coy when it comes to Miller's penchant for nudity). As an experiment in aesthetics, it works - it's fun, it's technically interesting. As a film for an audience of more than two? Well, that's something else. The three narratives are insufficiently connected for this ever to gel as a single piece, and whatever chance there is of immersing yourself in the Sin City universe is constantly undermined by the insistent use of voice-over narration. You're never allowed to fall into the world, but rather are distracted by a never-ending string of ""hard boiled"" one-liners that describe precisely what you're seeing on screen or could reasonably deduce from the performances if the camera were ever allowed to linger on them. They could be interesting stories about complex, damaged people, but Rodriguez fails to get the most out of the material because he doesn't seem to trust it - or trust himself. In his obsession to replicate the precise look of what's on the page he fails to use more of the power of the screen - strong performances, real atmosphere, temporal and aural control rather than just visual. It leaves me wondering why he bothered. If you're not going to use the power of the other register, why bother with a transposition? The result is a film which is technically accurate, visually stunning, but ringingly hollow at the core. The whole piece seems overly cruel as a way of masking its lack of character, humanity, or actual story. And rather than growing out of the long noir tradition, it feels like a postmodern hijacking of it. Worse, it isn't even hijacked for good reason - it doesn't add to the tradition, nor critique it, nor say anything new or interesting about it. Miller has said repeatedly that his central theme is love. But in a town this self-indulgently violent and artfully superficial, it's hard to take any such subtext seriously."
"Nightscream","1","82","172","18 April 2005"," A CGI-concocted mess that makes a mockery of both the medium it's told in, and the medium from which it's derived
","Scott McCloud, in ""Understanding Comics,"" made the important observation that in comics, and media in general, there is a tendency to confuse form with content. Every medium has its own tools for storytelling. The best creators make full use of the distinct language of these media, and overcome their limitations. When adapting material from one medium to another, good creators take heed of these different tools, resulting in masterpieces like Sidney Lumet's ""Twelve Angry Men"", or ""Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan."" But with movies based on comics, there's this bizarre fallacy that the fact that the story is derived from a comic should somehow affect what the movie looks like, which doesn't hold for movies based other media.<br/><br/>Say someone adapts a play into a movie. Do they show, on the movie screen, curtains being closed and opened in between scenes? Of course not. When adapting a best-selling book, do they show pages being turned on the screen? The very notion is silly to suggest. Each medium has its own tools for telling a story, and these things are merely aspects of the medium from which the film is being adapted. To suggest that the ""mechanical"" nature of the medium from which a film is adapted should somehow inform the look of the film (""The film is based on a comic book, so we have to show pages from the comic book in the opening title sequence"") is to engage in non-sequitur. Hollywood doesn't get that, and gives us a Batman TV show with actual sound effects written on screen, not realizing that such things are in comics because they don't *have* sound, or even dumber, a ""Hulk"" film that attempts to use actual panels, as if the otherwise-lauded director doesn't get that panels are only used in comics because they are, by nature, told through a composition of static images. Some, get it right with the ""Superman"" and ""X-Men"" films, but some seem so focused on making good ""comic book movies"" that it doesn't seem to understand that they should instead be setting out to make good ""movie"" movies.<br/><br/>But if Rodriguez and Miller's travesty of a film shows no wisdom of this point. Why is it necessary to include narration in which the sound of a gunshot with a silencer is described? In the movie, we *hear* the silencer, so we don't need this cornball musing on it. Marv's ranting about the ""blood-for-blood good old days"" or Dwight's saccharine ""Valkyrie"" metaphor for Gail, made me cringe.<br/><br/>Why the obsession with having so many shots mirror actual panels in the books? The white-silhouettes-on-black backgrounds, which work in the comics, look utterly ridiculous on the screen. Is the story really enhanced by fluorescing Hartigan's tie, or the bandages on Marv's body so that we can see them when they rest of their figures are in shadow? The almost entirely-CGI backgrounds, which Rodriguez cluelessly lauds as making his work easier are lifeless and artificial. When Josh Hartnett walks onto the balcony in the film's prologue, never once do I feel that what I see behind him is real, and any suspension of disbelief is lost. The subsequent pan of the buildings when this prologue ends, is equally about as vibrant as a bowl of oat bran. So oblivious are the directors to the simple reality that elements that work in comics may not work in film that no attempt is made to modify the scenes of Marv getting hit head-on with a car, or dragging a perp from his own car at 50 miles an hour, or Hartigan gushing blood when getting perforated by bullets, and the result descends into cartoonish preposterousness.<br/><br/>The directors would rather bury a big-name star like Oscar-winner Benicio Del Toro under gobs of facial prosthetics, despite the fact that there is nothing particular about his character that would require it . Squandering a film's star power like this underscores a total lack of judgment on the part of the directors.<br/><br/>What they did change is mind-boggling. Why was Bob, who shot Hartigan, his partner, several times, the one to greet Hartigan upon his release? Why was ""That Yellow Bastard"" cut up so that the first Act was shown before the rest of ""The Hard Good-bye"", and the rest of ""Bastard"" shown later? Why is Kevin seen in the beginning when he's about to kill Goldie, thus destroying the suspense of knowing her killer's identity? Why do Rodriguez and Miller include Manute's mention to Gail about ""serving a new master,"" which is a reference to the events of ""A Dame to Kill For"", which isn't in the movie? Why did they hire an actress to play Nancy Callahan who refused to do nudity, when that scene is so crucial to the story? I don't mind that the others didn't do the nude scenes in which their characters originally appeared, but the moment when Hartigan sees Nancy performing in ""That Yellow Bastard"" is a vital plot point in the story, because when we see that the little girl he saved is the same stripper we have come to know and love from previous stories, we're able to feel the same creepy feeling Hartigan does.<br/><br/>Armond White nailed it: ""Graphic art has its own principles and justifications that become inane when converted into live action. Rodriguez and Miller try to resolve this problem through digital photography that simplifies the imagery, recreating the starkness of print panels. Their wasted effort does little more than turn cinema back into two-dimensional flatness.<br/><br/>Rodriguez (uses) the same elastiviolence as in the ""Matrix"" movies: Killing and brutality are absurdly amplified yet have no effect. Rodriguez and Miller don't actually have an esthetic's, just a gimmick.<br/><br/>As shot by Rodriguez, ""Sin City""'s digital b&w lacks the mystery of photochemical b&w photography. A noir without the enveloping quality of shadow or the tactile sensation of smoke, it fails at what makes movies a great visual art form."""

","Sin City is a visually stunning film. I am not familiar with Frank Miller's work so I can only assume, like the previous posts have mentioned, that the movie is a faithful rendition of the comic book. It unrolls like an urban nightmare...a city that has lost all hope, doomed heroes, murderous whores, insane politicians, grotesque characters who commit unspeakable deeds. All of this in black and white, with a few glimmers of color. It's all somewhat anachronistic...the cars are all from the forties and fifties...but many of the weapons seem quite up to date.<br/><br/>From a style standpoint...this movie is great. I think it lacks on substance however.It's over-the-top, unrelenting, obsessive violence completely overshadows the plots. The blood, guts and gore eventually begin to overwhelm the entire movie. Every scene tries to out-splatter the one two minutes before. I went to this movie with a friend who bailed out about three quarters of the way through it. It's by far the bloodiest, most violent movie I've ever seen...and I've seen many of the nastiest.<br/><br/>When people left the theater, it was sort of a stunned silence. There was a time when there were films that actually had something called suspense."
"carriec-1","1","65","136","18 August 2005"," Overrated movie that will be forgotten within a year
","Let me start by saying that Sin City does do a couple of things right: The use of mixed color and monochrome to establish a surrealistic gritty film noir atmosphere works well, and the cinematography ranges from above average to excellent.<br/><br/>Beyond that, I don't understand why so many viewers seem to like this movie. Maybe a lot of people have confused ""LOOKS good"" with ""IS good"". Maybe the director is paying people to come here and boost the rating.<br/><br/>Color and camera work aside, this movie has nothing else to offer. Like a shiny new sports car without an engine, it looks good but doesn't go anywhere. The true measure of any movie is simple: Does it entertain? For Sin City the answer is ""no""! Here's why: <br/><br/>(The following text contains a couple of scene descriptions and a very generalized plot summary. If you consider those to be spoilers, then continue at your own risk.) <br/><br/>The characters are never developed. Some manage to be two-dimensional, but most barely rate even one dimension. The ""action"" sequences, when they finally happen, are protracted and dull. There is plenty of mindless violence, but it's hard to care about it since the characters to whom it's happening are so shallow and meaningless. In fact, I have one further complaint about the violence - it's too cartoonish to be taken seriously, but not cartoonish enough to be funny.<br/><br/>On the subject of funny... There are a few deliberate attempts at humor, but they are mostly on the level of ""Gilligan's Island"" slapstick; they fall flat in this darker environment. (A nameless lackey is shot through the chest with an arrow - he looks at the arrow, then asks if someone will call a doctor for him. No one pays attention to him. No one calls a doctor.) These deliberate attempts at humor are matched by the number of times the film is funny when it isn't supposed to be. (A savage dog attacks one of the characters. He defends himself by knocking it unconscious with a punch. I think this was supposed to be dramatic, but instead it was awkwardly reminiscent of the better-done scene in ""Blazing Saddles"" where Mongo punches the horse.)<br/><br/>What about the plot, you might ask? Yes, Sin City does have a plot (which makes it better than some movies I've seen), but it's a pretty thin one: ""Lots of bad people live in town. Some good people live there too. Bad things happen to all of them."" In this movie the good guys don't win, but the bad guys do harm each other quite a lot.<br/><br/>My last complaint is about the narration. Used properly, narration is an important tool of the True Crime / Film Noir genres, advancing the plot and revealing hidden depths within the characters. However, in a movie with weak plot and weaker characters, continuous narration is a useless appendage. Here it is even worse, being overused to the point of actually becoming an annoyance. Like a balloon that has used up all it's hot air (and this narration has a LOT of hot air), it hangs limp and impotent, weighing down the movie and dragging it to a halt.<br/><br/>Conclusion: By next year (summer 2006) only film historians will remember this movie exists. Everyone who actually saw it will have long since forgotten about it."

Then I began to wonder why I kept on looking, while getting more nervous every minute. Beneath that superbly styled skin of the movie was this constant tone of stupid violence, aggression, pure negative energy. Do I really want to look and feel that for two full hours? What's the point? I have to say I like comic movies like the first two Batman movies, Spiderman, X-men (very good balance between story, characters and special effects), and even Hellboy or the not so very good Spawn. And although I must say this movie is an extremely good adaptation of the original comic, I have to say ""So what?"". Is it a good movie? Well, technically speaking yes. Very good indeed. Is it worthwhile watching it? Well, if you're a designer, photographer or something like that, it can be very inspiring. At least for some time. But for the rest it's a complete waist of time. And I can stand some violence in movies if it's meaningful or 'human'. I liked Kill Bill and I like the movies of Kitano. But this was all just so negative!

Well, if the movie is accurately following the graphic novel, then it must be ONE COOL GRAPHIC NOVEL. The movie features several vignettes happening in a lawless town. Only a few individuals have the will to fight the nastiness that reigns supreme. Among them are Hartigan (Bruce Willis), a cop who always has an axed to grind; Marv (an unrecognizable Mickey Rourke), a disfigured man who won't be double-crossed; and Dwight (Clive Owen), who shows why you don't want to annoy some people.<br/><br/>My favorite scene was when Marv was dangling a man out of a car, so to speak. And violent? This movie is V-I-O-L-E-N-T-issimo. But don't worry; it's done in good taste. ""Sin City"" is awesome almost beyond belief. But you'd better believe that you're watching it, and that it is one neat movie."

","Rodriguez and Tarantino just keep doing these hyper-violent movies and we believe via some clever and cute dialogue that they're ""laughing at the genre"", ""turning violence around 360 degrees"", ""standing the archetypes on their heads so that we can laugh at ourselves. And the universe."" Really, this is just cr*p plain and simple. These guys like to bathe us in blood & gore because that's all they're good at. It isn't fun; it isn't funny; and it's not even a little clever. A few hip lines and a couple of cool scenes don't make for a good movie.<br/><br/>This is close to the worst movie I've ever scene. All of the tricks are right in your face - Rourke's band-aids; the ninja hookers; the dismemberments and dogs chewing on leg stumps.<br/><br/>It's much like reading through one of the cartoons in Heavy Metal magazine by those ""edgy geniuses""."

","Sickening and stressful mess uses that ""Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow"" technology to get its shocking points across. Four stories intertwine and twist together in an otherworldly metropolis known as Basin City. An old washed up detective (Bruce Willis) tries to stop a child molester (Nick Stahl) who happens to be the son of a high up government official (Powers Boothe). Stahl has kidnapped a young girl (Makenzie Vega), with Willis and shady partner Michael Madsen hot on his trail. Two-time felon Mickey Rourke wakes up one night and finds his lover (Jaime King) dead. He vows revenge and learns of horrific events just outside the city's landscape as quiet psychopath Elijah Wood and Catholic cardinal Rutger Hauer are going around and indulging in cannibalism with helpless prostitutes as their victims. Rourke, along with lesbian parole officer Carla Gugino and King's twin sister (King again), go on a disturbing journey to stop the deviant duo. But will they become victims themselves in the process? On another side of town a bar-room waitress (Brittany Murphy) is having a love affair with the enigmatic Clive Owen to the dismay of abusive boyfriend Benicio Del Toro. Del Toro is a rough customer who has his own entourage of thugs. Soon the friction between Owen and Del Toro drifts into a dark part of the city where a gang of prostitutes (led by Rosario Dawson, the meek Alexis Bledel and ninja Devon Aoki) rule their territory with violent street justice. Del Toro has a secret though and eventually a war with underground criminals (led by Michael Clarke Duncan) seems imminent for all concerned. As all these stories transpire, a beautiful stripper (Jessica Alba) pops up again and again. How does the ultra-hot Alba fit in to the complicated puzzle? These three tales are bookended by yet another side-story of a quiet assassin (Josh Hartnett) who always seems to be around beautiful women. ""Sin City"" starts off as a nightmare and does not let up until its finale. Based on Frank Miller's graphic novels from a few years back, the series of stories was never really more than glorified comic books for underground groups. Miller, (who co-directed with Hollywood maverick Robert Rodriguez), has a jumble of ideas running through his over-active head. Some look at his concepts as edgy and innovative, but to me they are just sick and silly. Most American junior high students could come up with similar ideas and their ability to translate those ideas to celluloid form would likely be as good as this (not a compliment). A real study in watching hot women, ugly characters, stupid stories, and charnel house violence. ""Sin City"" is not a place you would want to live and it is definitely not a place you should ever visit. Nothing to recommend. Turkey (0 stars out of 5)."
"squirrel_burst","9","4","5","16 October 2014"," Visually striking and memorable. Dark fun.
","""Sin City"" is gritty, dirty, sleazy and violent. It's an excellent adaptation of the graphic novels by Frank Miller and even if you haven't read the original material, it's a lot of fun. This anthology film features characters that are memorable and likable (or despicable) so it will grab your attention and hold on tight the whole way. There are a lot of memorable scenes and lines that are sure to stick with you too but the best part of the film is the art direction and visual style. An element I'm glad they kept from the original source is that the stories are told almost entirely in black and white, with sharp contrast accentuated in many scenes to not only make certain actions more visually striking, but also to make it easy to follow. Then, the movie does something unique. There are dashes of color in certain scenes to make certain actions and characters even more striking. There's a certain character that is highlighted with the color yellow. His physical appearance already makes him stand out, but that use of color makes him feel extra creepy and it's very effective. The sets and character designs (because some characters here are fitted with heavy makeup and prosthetics to make them stand out and look even more unique) make every frame look like a comic book panel, Every shot I saw looked like it had been meticulously planned out, like a piece of art you could have framed on your wall. The bold style isn't just a gimmick though. It's all blended in seamlessly with the story and helps to reinforce the grittyness and themes of corruption while helping accentuate the prevalent violence of the film. My only real criticism is that some of the performances aren't great (Bruce Willis plays it too low-key). It's a disappointment considering some of the others are quite good, and not in the ways you would expect either. I had to do a double take when I realized that was Elijah Wood and Mickey Rourke I just saw! It's a bit of a mixed bag in that department, but everything else is top notch. Once you see ""Sin City"" you'll be hard pressed to forget it, and not only because of the visuals. (Extended cut on Blu-ray, August 25, 2012)"
"siderite","9","4","5","23 September 2014"," Visual originality on good old fashioned film noir themes
","It's hard to rate a movie that has its focus on style, rather than story, but still manages to use good plots with interesting rich characterization. Is it a perfect film or just a niche genre that cannibalizes comic books and dazzles us with nice visuals and huge stars?<br/><br/>For me it was a bit of both. I loved the visuals and I liked the noir theme, but then I am of a certain age; I grew up with stories like that. The indomitable males that can resort to violence as easily as they breathe and only need a fantasy woman to get into action are kind of an endangered species today, when every hero must obey the politically correct guidelines of the present and all the women must be more than good looking damsels in distress, but you can see how that way of thinking was the archetype of all the hero action movies in the last 50 years. It feels strange to see a 68 year old cop kissing the 19 year old girl who is truly in love with him. Today only Michael Douglas can pull that off, and only in a film that shows how pathetically misguided he is. And how strange it is to get those morally ambiguous endings when the hero wins and also loses. Fair trade?<br/><br/>I can only recommend watching this film. Even if it would have been worse, I would have still recommended it. The unique style, the modernized noir, the amazing cast. The only thing that I kind of disliked was that it is a mosaic film. There are actually three stories and one very short one. They kind of intersect, but only accidentally. Well, watch it."
"Red-Barracuda","9","4","5","4 August 2012"," Now and again Hollywood hits home with something really great
","As comic book adaptions go, you just don't get any better than this. Sin City does a rare thing where it scores equally highly as a piece of innovative visual art as it does as entertainment. Much of the success must surely be put down to Robert Rodriguez working alongside Frank Miller the creator of the comic. With Miller on board it meant that the movie was unlikely to end up being watered down and safe. In actual fact Sin City is a fairly uncompromising movie as far as comic-book adaptions go. It's full of sadism, sexuality and perversion. This is in keeping with the original comic which was based in a place full of corruption, sleaze and violence.<br/><br/>The narrative is made up of several inter-connected crime stories, á la Pulp Fiction (in fact Quentin Tarantino directed the scene where Dwight and Jackie Boy talk in a car). Much of the information is given via voice-overs that detail the central character's inner thoughts. All of this comes direct from the original comic's pages which adds further to the faithfulness of the adaption. But over and above everything Sin City is a film of amazing visuals. Alternatively beautiful and grotesque, the look of the film is always highly inventive and experimental. The choice of doing the film in black and white with selective colour was a very bold one. But it's a decision that paid off massively.<br/><br/>The cast is outstanding. Amongst others, Mickey Rourke, Clive Owen, Rosario Dawson, Benico Del Toro, Bruce Willis, Jessica Alba, Elijah Wood, Nick Stahl and Rutger Hauer star in a selection of very memorable roles. Rourke, Owen and Willis are the three central characters and all are very solid. Wood and Stahl are both seriously creepy as respectively a serial killer and a hideous paedophile. While Rosario Dawson and Jessica Alba simply melt the screen such is their sheer sex appeal. In general, Sin City is considerably sexier than most Hollywood movies. Its sensuality is in fact one of its main strengths.<br/><br/>Violent, sexy and cinematically inventive. That's Sin City. A real triumph."

","Sin City is one of those rare films from the film noir genre that I seen. This movie certainly impressed with me with its unique style. The whole film was shot in black and white with the exception of a few colors here or there. Also, this movie is very violent. The violence reminds me of the Kill Bill movies.<br/><br/>This movie basically tells the story of three hit men who are thirsty for righteousness in a way but in order to get that, they do nothing but kill.<br/><br/>The cast is impressive. There are many stars such as the great Bruce Willis and Mickey Rourke. Jessica Alba looks hot as she usually does.<br/><br/>Now this movie is not for kids. There is plenty of death and prostitution here. But I like it one these kind of movies come out once in a while. They usually have great visuals like this film.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a great though violent film. I rate this film 9/10."

","Miller fans had always been waiting for a film adaptation of his graphic novels, and when Sin City finally hit the silver screen, you can imagine the kind of cult following it brought with it. But not only did it bring a long awaited adaptation for fans, but it also brought a brilliant, artistic film, blended with a mixture of film noir and modern cinema that amazed masses.<br/><br/>Sin City is an achievement in the comic-to-screen adaptation genre after countless failures from predecessors. With an absolute A-list cast, stunning cinematography and flawless direction, Sin City delivers everything anticipated. The translation from the comic to the film is almost identical and Rodriguez keeps everything true to the novels. The black-and-white film mixed with emphasized glimpses of color is a beautiful addition and the performances are absolute spot on for the most part, especially Rourke, who completely shines. Elijah Wood was another impressive, diverse performance, regardless of how brief or speechless it is.<br/><br/>I have very little to criticize this film about - it truly is a fantastical, fresh experience. Maybe some of the script came out a bit corny in places, just as expected when translating from a graphic novel but I have seen this film many times and never tire of its brilliance.

Hartigan's, Marv's and Dwight's actions are all MARVellous.

"DonFishies","9","4","5","20 June 2006"," It's just one of those films that you cannot call anything but cool
","Frank Miller's Sin City is simply, the best comic book film ever made. For every film with characters based in comics, you always hear the critic commenting on whether the film was good or not, and you always hear the fanboys screaming out how the film completely ignores the comics mythos. For Sin City, both camps were raving. Robert Rodriguez, in his bold move of making Frank Miller his co-director, has helped to create a fantastically dark and sick looking film that feels more authentic than any other comic book film ever has.<br/><br/>The film mainly chronicles three of Frank Miller's stories (with tidbits of a fourth). The opening and closing story, ""That Yellow Bastard"", is about Hartigan (Bruce Willis), a hardnosed cop with a ""bum ticker"" (as he keeps mentioning), attempting to end the cycle of sexual depravity for Junior (Nick Stahl). The second takes off right after the opening of ""Bastard"", and is ""The Hard Goodbye"". It recalls Marv's (Mickey Rouke, behind layers and layers of face makeup) quest to find the killer(s) who set him up for the murder of Goldie (J'aime King), the one woman who treated him better than the monster he is. The final story, sandwiched in the middle of ""Goodbye"" and the ending of ""Bastard"", is ""The Big Fat Kill"". This story chronicles Dwight (Clive Owen) and his desire to ensure that a pack of thugs, including Jackie Boy (Benicio Del Toro, again, under heavy face makeup), do not harm any girls in Basin City (notice where the title comes from?).<br/><br/>Revealing any of the other elements of the story only ruins the film, as all of them tie together into one collective story.<br/><br/>Having read the comics after seeing the film, I can only stand even more amazed than I was after getting up in the theatre. Rodriguez, Miller and Co. have literally taken the images off the comic book pages, and put them to celluloid. Every bit of the dark and brooding atmosphere of the books, is here in the film. From the black and white with splashes of choice colour, to the provocative clothing, to the strong graphic violence, even down to getting actors who look distinctly like their characters in the books (including those with horrific makeup); it's all here, and it all feels distinctly authentic.<br/><br/>The story lines, no matter how darkly bizarre, brutally violent or how bleakly funny they become, all stay true to the comics. Every single actor breathes life into the words of Miller, and acts out their parts very well. When you look at the actor acting out their part, you cannot help but feel you are reading one of the books. It's that distinctive, and that much true to the books. Yes, there were a few changes in regards to the excessive nudity of the books, but the change was an obvious one that does not take away from the films at all. If anything, it only adds to weak areas of the books.<br/><br/>Even more amazing than anything however, is the visual effects. The entire film was filmed on a green-screen, with only a few sets actually built. The rest is fully computer generated, and was filmed in parts (with many of the actors sharing the screen, never meeting each other until later on). The way Rodriguez has helped capture the film, is a testament to what digital technology holds for us in the future. It's sharp and is clearly, the only way Miller's stories could have ever been justifiably shown in a film. Every character looks like they are on every set, and nothing looks fake at all.<br/><br/>For everything that is done right in the film, it still is not absolutely perfect. The pacing is a bit off in many of the scenes, and having ""Yellow Bastard"" bookend the three stories really was not a wise choice (as it is the most uninteresting, and is mainly filled with exposition). There's just something off in the editing, and it really takes away from the strength the rest of the film packs. It's a fantastic film, and the clear-cut best film of 2005. But I will be damned if I say that the editing and pacing does not feel right.<br/><br/>It may not be for everyone, but for anyone who can see it, Frank Miller's Sin City is just one of those films that you cannot call anything but cool. It's a masterpiece, and is a film that will be remembered for a long time, if not, as the pioneer of what digital photography can do for a film. It's fantastic, and is authentic. What more could a comic book fan ask for? <br/><br/>9.5/10."

"JamukLey","1","37","77","7 June 2005"," Worse than Attack of the Clones
","I was utterly shocked at how much I hated this film. Now I very much believe in the creative freedom and expression of art, be it sculpture, painting, music, whatever. I understand the nature of the graphic novels. Much of them recreate that distinct moment, a shot in time, creating intimacy out of even the most brutal of actions. I really liked Miller's Sin City comics and the trailers for this film certainly demonstrated a first: the actual comic itself was on screen.<br/><br/>Nothing was left to interpretation or consideration from any kind of point of view. No actual script was written, just the whole thing plonked on film. In this case it would be churlish to call it an 'adaptation', more a reproduction. Unfortunately, although Sin City is incredibly effective on the page, it's dreadful in the cinema.<br/><br/>Its saving grace is that Sin City is wonderful to look at, but it is so utterly empty. I don't think I have ever been impressed by a Rodriguez film (Spy Kids passed me by). Its unforgivable soullessness scuppered it from the beginning. Much of the crowd I was with where the reprehensible 'cool' bunch who thought much of the violence (a lot of it against women) was funny and there were a couple of cheers here and there. Granted it made me laugh, but most often out of sheer disbelief.<br/><br/>***SPOILER*** It irritated me. I found myself hoping that the psychotic cannibal Kevin (Elijah Wood) would actually tear Mickey Rourke's character apart (in graphic slow-motion  sheesh(!), this film HAS affected me). I hated the character of Marv; he was such a phoney creation. The dialogue (although fine in the comic), when spoken aloud, was worse than George Lucas, yet it is hailed a work of genius, a masterpiece, cool. Well thank you Beavis and Butthead. Also, when Benicio Del Toro's character (almost pantomime villain territory here, with added claws) was discovered to be the cop who was keeping the peace between the law, mobs and prostitutes, it occurred to me, why didn't they recognise him at first? Almost every prostitute in Old Town was there.<br/><br/>Hartigan's (Bruce Willis) ongoing saga of his heart attack was conveniently forgotten so he could kill off the yellow Star Trek reject in the last story, and then blows his own brains out. Surely it would have been more poetic to have his heart fail at the last? The ultimate broken heart? ***END SPOILER*** Well that's a tad cheesy as well, but no less worse than this detritus. And I'm not the film maker here. And it just WENT ON! I wanted it to stop at several points which, unfortunately for me, turned out to be half way through. This is coming from a man who adores The Return of the King. That's how tedious this film is.<br/><br/>It's the Patrick Bateman of films, beautiful, soulless and utterly ugly underneath. Doubtless Rodriguez will be lauded for this, the cinematic equivalent of the Emperor's New Clothes."
"Doogie D","5","24","48","2 April 2005"," empty, empty, empty
","SIN CITY is an okay movie, but bothersome. It's just empty, vigilante nihilism, basically, except for Bruce Willis' character. It's a set-'em-up, knock-'em-down kind of movie -- establish protagonist, establish villain, establish heinous deed(s), kill villain heinously; next story. The three main stories which make the lion's share of the movie are also pretty similar, so it gets repetitive and feels too long. There are lots of acts of violence, but for the most part they're very cartoonish, so we can squirm happily and know that nothing's really at stake -- certainly not our notions of the world or anything.<br/><br/>This is the part that bugs me: stuff like this and Kill Bill are these constructs, these exercises, just as much as something like Wimbledon or Summer Catch are. It doesn't bother me so much that we as an audience will go see a fluffy romantic comedy as it does that the better directors in the machine are now cranking out vengeance scenarios with witless but kind of inventive brutality, and that's our popcorn. I'm not thrilled with what that says.<br/><br/>There's nothing there; it's not like the constructions of, say, the Coens or Kubrick, which you can argue are cold, but at least are recognizably informed by life and thought; this stuff is informed by movies, basically, so you get hallmarks of characters without any fleshing out which really lets you get lost in that world. There's not a lot to think about when it's over (except how empty it is). And I know the argument against wishing for more is ""it's just entertainment."" Well, okay: then that turns it back to us. What are we seeking out as entertainment? But, yeah -- I bought my ticket, so I contributed. I should have gone with my instinct.<br/><br/>Yep -- it looks good, but that pleasure disappears pretty quickly. It's not Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow -- which was ridiculous in a whole other way -- but it suffers a similar effect: good technology just can't take the place of a gripping story. If this movie had been as cleverly plotted and populated as, say, Blood Simple, and we actually gave a damn about the characters except as action figures, it could've been a masterpiece; it had all the elements except for some bad acting here and there (Jessica Alba, and especially Michael Madsen, who is just awful).<br/><br/>It's just sad."
"BigHardcoreRed","Null","16","30","5 April 2005"," Instant Classic! Hardcore, Violent & Still Sexy!
","Frank Miller's Sin City is an instant classic. I have never read the comic book so I can not tell you how true to the book it is, but never the less, I enjoyed it immensely. The style of the movie made to look like a black & white comic book with splashes of color was excellent. I assume that maybe the color was meant for a deeper purpose, but thus far, have not been able to figure it out. The comic look came off very comic book like (couldn't come up with a word) at times. The absence of color did not deter me or hinder my enjoyment in any way.<br/><br/>The story is actually 3 different stories that come together in the end, similar to Pulp Fiction but easier to follow. Hartigan (Bruce Willis) was the star of the first story. He was a cop who would stop at nothing to insure an 11 year old girl's safety. Marv (Mickey Rourke), my personal favorite character in the movie, was a man who was set up to look like a murderer and must overcome incredible odds to clear his name. Dwight (Clive Owen) is the star of the 3rd story, which begins as he must protect his girlfriend, Shellie (Brittany Murphy), from her evil ex-boyfriend, Jackie Boy (Benicio Del Toro).<br/><br/>All three stories are extremely violent and very adult oriented. That is probably why I liked it. It was a very adult themed comic book movie. I can not find any faults in any of the characters or actors. I enjoyed all those I wrote of earlier as well as some honorable mentions, which include Jessica Alba, Elijah Wood, Rosario Dawson, Jaime King, Devon Aoki, Carla Gugino, Alexis Bledel, Michael Madsen and really the entire cast.<br/><br/>Overall, this movie is full of hardcore and violent images, yet still maintains it's comic book feel. It is very different from other movies of the genre such as Spider-Man or Hulk but closer to The Punisher but felt a little darker. If you like dark movies full of violence and sexy women, then I can highly recommend this to you. 9.5/10"

","Sin City is a highly stylised, brutally violent and deeply puerile string of clichés that will appeal to gore-loving teenagers and older men who are still in touch with their inner pubescent.<br/><br/>Its fans will say that the pictures count for a thousand words, and they are right. It does look fabulous, but the relentless corniness of the hard-boiled script often grates because it rarely crosses over from cringeworthiness into parody. It is Da-Vinci-Code bad. Teen-fan-fiction bad. It is studiously below the standard of mediocre but rarely so bad that it is funny. If you have ever played the computer game Max Payne, another graphic-novel inspired romp, you will know the standard.<br/><br/>The plot is divided into three episodes that are mixed up chronologically but have little in common other than some locations (a bar and a red light district) and themes (an abundance of prostitutes). All are pretty simple, and two are very straightforward revenge sagas. Vengeance obviously requires a certain degree of violence, but the extremes used here are less righteous justice than a gimmick to make teenagers say: ""Whoah, did you see him rip that guy's dick off?"" I thought I was quite tolerant of film violence - at least until I saw Kill Bill vol 1 - but when one character caves a villain's head in with his fists I just felt alienated.<br/><br/>In one sense this is a very satisfying film. It fits its stereotype perfectly. If you like hard-boiled graphic novels and extreme violence you will love it. If you like plots and characterisation, just walk away."

","Sin City is (like Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow) a visual achievement, and deserves credit for bringing realism to the graphic novel of the same name. It's hard to criticize a movie that does in spades what it sets out to do.<br/><br/>I will say, however, that if you're not a fan of graphic novels, and their predispositions for violence, sexual stereotyping, and grim looks at humanity, then you'd be better off skipping Sin City. With only a few exceptions, every character in the movie is a psychopath, complete with a killing and/or torture fetish and the expected lack of remorse. We are given ""good"" guys and ""bad"" guys, but they're hard to tell apart sometimes. And I don't think I've ever seen a movie in which 90% of the female characters are strippers or prostitutes. But of course, this is a depiction of a fictional city, in which there is a lot of sin. Hence the title.<br/><br/>This is an obvious generalization, but this movie will go over really well with guys who like violence and naked women. It will offend just about everyone else. There will be a few who will accept it as a well realized comic book fantasy, but they won't like the aftertaste. 6.5/10"

Part Video Game, Part Comic Strip, Part Cinematic Nightmare, (and unlike MATRIX, which really only had a handful of scenes introducing its Revolutionary 360 Degree characteristic ""Bullet-Time"" panoramic shots in slow motion) SIN CITY, from its opening credits to its last on screen seconds, speaks a new, intensely original cinematic language, which will keep you profoundly hypnotized for every second of its two hour duration! <br/><br/>Bruce Willis, Benecio Del Toro (The Usual Suspects, Traffic, 21 Grams), Elijah Wood (The Lord of the Rings trilogy, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind), Rosario Dawson (Men In Black II, Alexander), Jessica Alba (Never Been Kissed, Dark Angel), Michael Clarke Duncan (The Green Mile, The Scorpion King), Brittany Murphy (8 Mile, Little Black Book), Mickey Rourke (Man on Fire, Once Upon a Time In Mexico), Nick Stahl (In The Bedroom, Terminator 3) Clive Owen (King Arthur, Closer, The Bourne Identity) and Josh Hartnett (Pearl Harbor, Blackhawk Down, Wicker Park), among many others, seem to present us with ""the Mother of All CASTS!"" <br/><br/>With such an awesomely impressive cast, I imagine that many of the actors involved agreed beforehand to receive, instead of a lump sum payment before filminga small percentage of the box office after release and distribution. If this is true, they will make out like bandits, because SIN CITY shows up as one of the 15 or 20 highest grossing films of 2005! And if you saw a lot of Latin/Hispanic names in the above list, you are quite right....Latinos abound in SIN CITY! <br/><br/>Now, back to focusing on another chilling aspect of this amazing film..The TOTAL Metamorphosis of a good part of its cast. It is as if they had been transformed by a some sort of digital spell and assimilated whole onto the screen, and thusly, surpassing and supplanting the real for the surreal! So much so that I stayed a few extra minutes, at the end of the film, to analyze carefully the credits, because, and there is absolutely NO exaggeration in this comment, several actors were simply TOTALLY UNRECOGNIZABLE! <br/><br/>But as nothing is perfect in this life, SIN CITY does have its very dark side. Generally, I hate violent movies. Unfortunately, SIN CITY sins, and SINS BIG in this area! Even, it is a relentless orgy of gruesomely violent scenes. I feel quite upset with myself for having enjoyed SIN so much!!! The only excuse I can think of say is that perhaps precisely for its video game- like feel and quality, its resemblance to a digital cartoon, that it provided me the reaction it did! (Seemingly, it had the same effect on 90% of the audience)<br/><br/>Anyway, the above is still a little unsettling. It left a bit of a bizarre after-taste!! Also, I must confess that perhaps, at least in the case of SIN CITY, my fervor and passion for Everything Original certainly exceeded my aversion to violence in cinema ....One final note: SIN CITY, of course, is absolutely no place for kids!!!<br/><br/>ENJOY!/DISFRUTELA!"

"TOMNEL","9","5","7","16 August 2005"," Extreme violence, great writing, great direction and for the most part, great acting!
","Bruce Willis, Clive Owen, Mickey Rourke, Rosario Dawson, Jessica Alba, Alexis Bledel, Benicio del Toro, Devon Aoki, Nick Stahl, Michael Clarke Duncan, Jaime King, Brittany Murphy, Carla Guigino, Elijah Wood, Michael Madsen, Rutger Hauer, Patricia Vonne, Josh Hartnett and Frank Miller as the priest.<br/><br/>This movie is so entertaining, most of all because of the fabulous direction. The black and white, with spots of vibrant colors....it's cool! This movie is made up of three stories. The first story is about crazy man Marv(Rourke) meeting beautiful Goldie(King). He's really ugly, but she shows him compassion, but when they sleep together, someone kills her in the bed, and Marv is blamed for it. He goes on a killing rampage to find out who killed his girl. He ends up getting help by several hookers, including Becky(Bledel) and Gail(Dawson) and help by exotic dancer Nanci Callahan(Alba). The story runs at 34 minutes long, and is my favorite one.<br/><br/>Story two is about Shelley(Murphy), a skimpy waitress getting a visit from her ex-boyfriend Jackie-boy(Toro) and her new boyfriend Dwight(Owen) teaches him a lesson. When Jack leaves, Dwight follows him around and sees he goes to Whore's Alley and tries to pick up girls and with the help of hooker and his new girl Gail(Dawson) they stop him and stop crime boss Manute(Duncan) from taking over the alley. 39 mins.<br/><br/>Story 3 actually starts the film off with the first ten minutes of it, and ends it also. Nice cop Hartigan(Willis) has to retire from his job due to his bad heart condition, but he's not through. He needs to catch Junior(Stahl) who has skinny young Nanci Callahan(age 11) and is planning on raping her. Junior's dad is the senator and very powerful. Hartigan's ex-partner Bob(Madsen) realises that they will go down with Junior, and after Hartigan shoots Junior's ear, hand, and penis off, he shoots Hartigan and leaves him for dead. Hartigan is hospitilized and beaten merciless until he admits he raped her. He is put in jail for eight years and gets cleverly disguised letters from Nanci every Thursday. When he gets out, he sees Nanci, age 19 and tries to protect her from Junior, who had work done to grow his ear, hand and penis back, and has become a fat yellow freak. This segment is 38 minutes in length.<br/><br/>The opening/closing involves a romantic hit-man(Josh Hartnett) that seduces women and then kills them.<br/><br/>my review-A. Excellent coloring, when there is color. The blood looks even redder. The eyes look even bluer. It's cool!<br/><br/>rated R for non-stop extreme violence, sexuality and nudity.<br/><br/>*Beware..this is extreme violence including men getting limbs ripped off one by one, nonstop heads coming off, blood and guts all over and even a man getting his penis and testicles getting ripped off on screen."

","I had high hopes, but I knew all too well how many comics-turned-movie that have been truly awful. Sin City laughed in the face of every expectation I had, and simply left me awestruck. I won't hesitate to call this one of the greatest movies I've had the pleasure of seeing.<br/><br/>The movie truly masters the all important ""suspension of disbelief"" or ""immersion"" that is the difference between a movie, and a fantastic movie. The visuals are brilliant, the characters are just spot-on, the city is brilliant, and with a story that fits the mood of the movie with absolute perfection, this is the one movie you cannot miss this year.<br/><br/>I could go on for hours about how the lead characters seem to have been bred specifically to appear in this movie (or how hot Devon Aoki is ;) but just go see this movie.<br/><br/>It's so wonderful to see movie makers do something that's ""just entertainment"" and do it so damned well, staying true to the heart and soul of the whole project. No force-feeding the audience with stagnant morale issues, no ""all American hero"" and you don't feel as if the movie wants to do anything but entertain you, like you haven't been entertained for a very long time."

Some of these actors had been down and out a lot recently, they have now been redeemed by making their characters come to life.<br/><br/>The cinematography was...there aren't any words to give it justice. It kept with the comic book feel and had a beautiful seediness with it.

","Wow. What an amazing movie this was. Movies do not get much cooler than this. This is a prime example of when two great minds come together and collaborate ideas all towards a common goal. Making A Great Film!!!! This movie was so great. The stylized film, The emphasis on colors, and the constant interior monologue really progress the emotions and feeling of every scene of this film. This film has been barely changed from the graphic novels, and it is because of this that this film retains a constant dark, gritty, pulp comic book feel. This movie is a great experience that will blow your mind and keep you thinking about it for a long time after its over. This film is not your standard comic book movie. This is a comic book in its truest form, taken from the pages and thrown on a big screen."
"John_Q_Citizen","Null","8","13","19 January 2007"," Great Movie That Brings a Comic Book To Life
","Frank Miller's experiences on the RoboCop movies were not pleasant ones. So, naturally, he was not very excited about having one of his most cherished graphic novel series made into a movie. Thank God for Robert Rodriguez and his crack squad of visual effects producers. With the short that they filmed (which actually starts Sin City), they had not only brought Miller on board, but convinced him to help co-direct.<br/><br/>There are three stories that this movie is composed of (actually four). The first centers on Marv, the big lug with a broken heart. He seeks bloody revenge on the men who killed his Goldie, and gets it many times over. The second tells us the story of Dwight, the skilled killer who seeks to protect the streets from a bent cop with 'a big drunk-on'. And he does. The last story revolves around Hartigan, the straight cop trying to protect an innocent little girl from a pedophile.<br/><br/>There is also a short opening sequence centering on a smooth hit-man out looking for a little cash.<br/><br/>As separate pieces, they stand out magnificently. But when you put them together, you have a movie. A damn good one, too. The stories make up a universe that may or may not be derived from a Pulp Fiction-esquire mythology. If you watch Pulp Fiction and then Sin City, you will notice some similarities (not to mention QT's little segment). But the style of the two films is vastly different. Sin City relies heavily on iconic visuals, taken straight from a Frank Miller drawing. If you freeze frame at about any point in the movie, it looks exactly like a panel from the graphic novel. The use of color at certain areas as well to emphasize a certain idea or object is quite beautiful.<br/><br/>But being similar to Pulp Fiction, this movie is violent--very violent, and is certainly not for weak-stomached individuals. Although, it is so heavily stylized that you really kind of applaud the violence in a way. Or maybe that's just me, being the freak I am. Lots of people complain about nudity as well and the amount of it in the movie, but there are only two characters who are nude. And it isn't that bad.<br/><br/>The actors are top-notch here. This is a weird thing to say considering how wooden, stereotypical, and melodramatic it is. But that's how it's supposed to be--no actor in this film could deliver a straight performance and get away with it. It would drive this film into the bowels of absurdity. Yet, the way the actors perform is quite cool to watch. Mickey Rourke gives one of the best performances in his career, and the other actors are not that far behind him.<br/><br/>Rodriguez was wise to shoot the movie frame-for-frame from the graphic novel. It simply would not have worked any other way. He shot the movie digitally, and I'm the first to admit that I'm not a big fan of digital. But, once again, it probably would not have worked if it wasn't shot all on green screen with digital cameras. Watch the movie and you'll see what I mean.<br/><br/>I think the real star here is obviously Frank Miller. He created the universe of Basin City, plus all of the iconic images. Truly deserving of his credit as 'co-director'.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a great movie. Fun, bloody, brilliant, and totally badass."

"ivo-cobra8","10","7","11","29 November 2015"," Frank Miller's best masterpiece ever!!!
","Sin City (2005) is one of the best comic book Frank Miller's thrillers ever made! It is one favorite best Bruce Willis movies. He just rocks in this role as Detective Hartigan! I just wish his character had a better ending. Great directing, acting and action throughout the movie. Amazing how the movie ties together, plot is perfect. The variety of characters in the movie diversify the story so well and not the mention the characters are very believable and played well. Definitely a must see for all Tarantino and Miller fans. This is the best movie ever made from the year 2005, it is been 10.years since this movie was released. 10 year anniversary and is still one the best entertaining thriller movies ever made. I just love this movie and everything in it. The movie is fun and it is a joy to watch and you can never get bored. <br/><br/>It is a Frank Miller's masterpiece and one of the best graphic novel! The best movie delivered from three directors Frank Miller, Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino. The movie has full, I mean full of famous actors in it. Everybody does a great job. The acting in this movie is realistic and really awesome! This movie can satisfy audiences that either want a simple fight movie along with those that want to look deeper and find an intricately woven story beneath. The numerous stars in this movie all go on to create unique characters that case viewers to actually care if something bad were to happen to them. Being based off a graphic novel, it also stays true to the original formula while being able to be easily viewed by those that have never read the graphic novel. The styling and art of the movie are both is interesting but also don't distract from the movie itself. The fight scenes stay vibrant and fresh and throughout the course of the movie, events seen in one part have unique and interesting ways to appear or connect in other scenes. <br/><br/>Bruce Willis stars as a cop with a bum ticker and a vow to protect a sexy stripper (Jessica Alba), Mickey Rourke as an outcast misanthrope on a mission to avenge the death of his one true love (Jaime King) and Clive Owen as Dwight, the clandestine love of Shellie (Brittany Murphy), who spends his night defending Gail (Rosario Dawson) and her Old Town girls from a tough guy (Benicio Del Toro) with a penchant for violence. Also starring Elijah Wood, Nick Stahl, Michael Madsen, Carla Gugino and Michael Clark Duncan.<br/><br/>That is the main plot about the movie. It has more story's to tell and it also has action in it. Even for black and White color movie it takes the vision of the most imaginative directors on earth. The film itself is outrageously entertaining. Director Robert Rodriguez does a masterful job with Frank Miller's material while also bringing filmmaking to a whole other level. This along with a spectacular cast makes this one of the best films of the past 10 years and one of the best graphic novel/comic adaptions. The biggest surprise of Sin City is that I enjoyed it.. a lot and Robert Rodriguez was one of the directors! Sin City gives us Four different stories with multiple different characters doing their parts in many different ways, we are given a Pulp Fiction type movie that has a grand finale and draws the audience into each and every tale told. The cast in this movie is superb! we have actors like Bruce Willis, Nick Stahl, Jessica Alba, Powers Boothe, Benicio Del Toro, Mickey Rourke, Michael Duncan Clarke, Rosario Dawson, Carla Gugino, Josh Hartnett, Brittney Murphy, Jaime King, Clive Owen, and Elijah Wood. all these actors have their moments to shine and nobody overlooks another. They all handle their roles beautifully in this. The artistic view in this movie are like something we haven not seen in the movies ever. Frank Miller wanted his ""baby"" to be exactly like his Dark Comics and RR did just that. The movie is in Black and White with certain colors brought out in certain scenes. Now when i say Black and White I am not talking about your regular B&W movie, imagine a comic book page taken out of the comic and placed onto the big screen. The whole movie looks just like that, and its AMAZING! <br/><br/>This movie is a perfect 10, the greatest thing about themovie is the theme that is just awesome.<br/><br/>Sin City (also known as Frank Miller's Sin City) is a 2005 American neo-noir crime thriller anthology film written, produced, and directed by Frank Miller and Robert Rodriguez.

"glennsouthall","9","7","11","30 March 2006"," Just like watching the comic book come to life!!
","Brilliant, just brilliant!!!<br/><br/>I remember reading somewhere that there was no real script to speak of, just the original frames from the comic books. It shows.. and it is this which makes the movie such a wonderful experience. Think about it. 1. A comic book has only still pictures and therefore there are certain styles of drawing required in order to portray movement, depth, action, which by necessity must appear exaggerated. There were many such shots in this movie that copied these exaggerated styles into film and the effect was awesome (particularly when characters were running). 2. Also, in a comic book there is only so much space for speech bubbles, therefore dialogue must be brief, stinted and straight to the point. In the movie this was wonderfully recreated. Many scenes of dialogue comprised just one-liners going back and forth...perfectly recreating the comic book experience. I have read in some reviewers comments that they feel the acting was sometimes poor and put it down to the script - completely missing the point. 3. More subtly, have you ever noticed in comic books that static (often background)characters never stand straight, upright and facing the reader directly? This would never work. Always, characters are portrayed from unusual angles, striking exaggerated poses. In the movie you will see many examples of this, (note particularly some of the shots with the hookers standing around, and the car thieves when discussing their marks) I am certain that if you did not notice this, it will subtly have added to your enjoyment. 4. Finally, in a comic book you will never find scenes remaining in the same place for long. It is necessary for the comic to remain dynamic and exciting to keep the action moving. This is why almost all such genre comics have the following sequence (or similar); Location shot: Short dialogue: action: leave: fast car: new location shot: short dialogue: action: leave: fast car.....and so on. Watch the movie again to see what I mean.<br/><br/>All of the above (with a few less easy to explain) added enormously to a moving comic book experience and was all intentional I'm sure. As I said before, brilliant!!"
"mirthly","10","7","11","8 April 2005"," The most entertaining film ever made.
","Sin City was the greatest experience I have ever had in a movie theatre. It delivered everything I have ever wanted in a film. The acting was terrific, the direction superb, and the style was simply astounding. This movie oozes style from it's every pore. There's just something so inherently cool about it. I never thought I would say that a movie was straight up cooler than Pulp Fiction, but Sin City has done it. The only thing it is missing is Samuel L. Jackson, but The rest of the cast more than makes up for that oversight. Even actors I normally don't enjoy, such as Britney Murphy, come off as hard as nails people living in a hard city.<br/><br/>The fact that it's the most faithful adaptation ever made doesn't hurt either. I've been a Frank Miller fan ever since I read ""The Dark Knight Returns"", but I hadn't read the Sin City comics before seeing the film. This means you don't necessarily have to be a fan of the comics to appreciate the genius of the film. But you better believe I'll be reading the comics first chance I get.<br/><br/>In my life I have seen hundreds and hundreds of films without ever thinking to myself ""This is it. This is the one. This is my favourite movie."". Sin City has given that to me, and for that I am very thankful to Robert Rodriguez and Frank Miller.<br/><br/>Thank you very much."

Marv (Mickey Rourke) is a hulking thug out to seek revenge against those who killed Goldie, the hooker with a soul like an angel.

He loves all things misogynistic, cruel and kinky. Gruesome murders, torture, pedophilia, cannibalism, decapitations galore  nothing is too sick to escape inclusion in this rather simple and predictable plot. Miller found the perfect directors (Robert Rodriguez with Quentin Tarrintino doing some ?guest? directing) to show off his standard fare in amazing style. The light, shadow, and spot use of color was simply superb for the story and source material. Unfortunately the directors never thought to refine the script to provide a true hardboiled film noir where the double-crosses are a surprise and the dames are as savvy and smart as the men. Instead they indulge Miller's obsession with tough, ugly guys who seem to win the attentions of the perfect hookers. Miller doesn't have a Madonna/Whore problem writing women, he has a Whore/Whore problem. I've never seen so many thongs, black leather studded outfits, and gun-toting dominatrixes in a film outside the XXX district. Russ Meyers has nothing on these guys. For that reason alone I predict the film will be a huge success. It's a male erotic S&M film wrapped up in so much style that every computer geek and teenaged male will flock to theaters once they've put down their video game controller or logged off the internet porn."

'Sin City' is probably the worst high-profile movie I have ever seen.<br/><br/>I wasn't too happy with Tarantino's 'Kill Bill' and Rodriguez's 'Dusk Till Dawn' can hardly be called a masterpiece, but their flaws seem almost negligible when compared to 'Sin City''s total lapse of reason.<br/><br/>It is a film without a heart, made by people who have drifted so far away in their extreme vision of cinema art that the resulting product could not be saved by the impeccable acting, solid direction and innovative looks.<br/><br/>'Sin City' is so full of pointless violence that there is hardly anything else in it.<br/><br/>Do I need to be a fan of the original comics to appreciate how 'true to the original' the film managed to stay? Is that such a virtue? The story lacks any coherence, the dialog is so flat, they could have omitted it altogether.<br/><br/>The fact that the film's overall rating on this site is way above 8.0 comes to illustrate the sad truth that no matter how bad a work of art is, there will still be people who admire it.<br/><br/>For an Artist that should be a depressing thought."

","Sin City is a modern rendition of a comic book told in the film noir style. It's shot in high-contrast black and white with an ever-present voice over narration that gives it the feel of this genre of old. In the old days, film noir gave us a glimpse of a gritty reality and a chance to see dime novels on the screen. They were cheap to make and got the job done.<br/><br/>Sin City is an extremely stylized version of the film noir, and, because it is based on a comic book it looks like a comic book and has characters from a comic book. It's more of a comic book than a film. How artistic.<br/><br/>Now, it's entirely true that blood and gore in black and white tend to appear, well, less RED. So it may be necessary to cut someone's arms and legs off and let a dog chew at the stumps in order to compensate for the lack of redness. But the real reason is that black and white is much more artistic. Some people will mistake this comic book disguised as a film for art."

The cast is fantastic and packed with sexy (un)dressed beautiful women. Rosario Dawson, Benicio Del Toro, Carla Gugino, Josh Hartnett, Rutger Hauer, Michael Madsen, Frank Miller (writer, producer, director and actor in this movie), Brittany Murphy, Clive Owen, Mickey Rourke, Elijah Wood,... Such a team gathered in the same movie is quite promising. When you see Jessica Alba dancing on the stage of striptease bar you'll completely forgot about Salma Hayek's performance in ""From Dusk till Dawn"", and her chemistry with Bruce Willis is fascinating.

In the first scene after the opening credits, the way the camera zooms in on Bruce Willis (Hardigan), facing him as he's driving. It is a very similar camera shot as as the beginning and end of Kill Bill Vol. 2 facing Uma Thurman and as the end of Jackie Brown, facing Pam Grier. As I've said before the cinematography in every Quentin Tarantino movie is absolutely brilliant, one of the qualities is that he often goes into black and white (probably because sometimes it can be a lot more affective than colour) and that same quality is used in Sin City; my guess is that it's a mixture of Frank Miller and Quentin Tarantino's idea. The whole element of the character ""Mi-Ho"" and her weaponry tactics is like a page out of Kill Bill's book. <br/><br/>Even though I am disagreeing with people saying that Quentin Tarantino was involved a lot more than what is said, this is not a negative comment. I thoroughly enjoyed the movie, because the combination of Frank Miller, Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino made the cinematography perfect!"

","There is no denying that, for a mainstream Hollywood summer blockbuster that visually Sin City is impressively different, stylish and quite daring. Not only does it provide George Lucas with a simple lesson in how to effectively use a blue screen, but it also provides an experience that looks unique and fascinating to be worth a look. The characters are all larger than life, the backdrops drip with smoke, grim, corruption and hopelessness and only occasionally does the CGI look clunky or the actors have the body language of people who are totally disconnected from their surroundings. The mix of black/white and colour is perhaps a bit obvious but is still a nice touch and, although I didn't think it pulled it off, the attempts at film noir played well with genre clichés.<br/><br/>Because the stories and characters are larger than life, the narratives do struggle a bit and it is only their pace and unrelenting grim violence that makes it possible to stick with it. However after about an hour I had got the idea (it is stylish, gritty and violent) and it didn't have much more after that  I never got bored but the more time went on the less impressed I was by it. The style of the film is grimy but it is no film noir in the sense that those familiar with the genre with be used to  instead of being suggestive it is blatant, instead of being sensual it is vampish, instead of being dark it is gory. While this is not a major problem in itself, the film does feel like it is dressing in clothes that are too big for it and aping films that made this all look so effortless many decades ago. Despite this, it was still so far so good  not enough substance perhaps but the style and genre clichés still were enjoyable.<br/><br/>The only really troubling aspects of the film come in the form of the women. All the characters are stereotypes designed to appeal to the adolescent male in the audience  whatever age he may actually be; men are grizzled, bloodied and yet somehow invincible until their heroic poetic deaths while the women are gorgeous, sexual and available. Although hardly useful for a character driven film (which this never is) it would have been acceptable  certainly these are roles that endless action movies cast the two sexes into. However with Sin City there is a constant, unpleasant air of sexual violence and fetishistic domination of these women that left a bad taste in my mouth  I'm sure the film is just being true to the material but it is difficult to swallow nonetheless. In noir, the women are often controlling of the men and if anyone destroys them, it is often themselves. Here women are beaten and they like it, they need men to protect them from other men, they are gorgeous but give it up like it was a bad habit, generally they are not defined by who they are but by what they are  ""dykes"", strippers, whores, rape victims and killers; that they are not real people is not a problem but the film's depiction and use of them within the narrative goes beyond the mere ""trophyism"" of music videos and adverts and is very close to being misogyny so harsh and spiteful it is.<br/><br/>Thanks to the pace and style though, I was mostly able to put this out of my mind and enjoy it as a comic book noir that appeals to those who like the noir style without having to watch old films and miss out on extreme violence and MTV flesh. Miller deserves credit for the style but Rodriguez brings it to life convincingly well. His cast are mostly good because they buy into it with such conviction, although, lets be honest here, other than the makeup and gruff voices, the male actors didn't have a massive stretch of their skills. Willis plays a role he had played so often it must be like second; Rouke is better because his character seems dumber and driven by love for a woman that didn't care for him (see  that's film noir) and I liked what he did with it. Stahl is pretty good and Clive Owen takes to the ""hard man cool"" like a duck to water. The male support cast are pretty good even if Boothe, Duncan, Hauer and Wood just come and go in minor roles. The women all look great and that is pretty much all that is asked of them. Dawson is gorgeous and playful but can't have been comfortable in those clothes; Murphy does her usual playful smile thing but just don't expect her to bring any gravitas to a character thrown between abusive, doomed men  not only doesn't she, she never tries. Alba is OK for all she does but the presence of Aoki proves that it is more who than what you know in the business. None of the women are that good but then this is not a women's film and they are only there for one thing.<br/><br/>Overall, complaining about male/female stereotypes in a summer blockbuster is a bit like taking a bath and moaning about getting wet, but the degree of sexual violence and the depiction of women does take some swallowing and will be a big problem to some viewers. The grimy style may smack of someone aping noir rather than ""doing"" noir but it is at least refreshingly different from the usual summer fare. The lack of depth is a minor problem but it still works thanks to the pace and engagingly gritty and dark story lines leaving me in no doubt that (as shown by the presence of Tarantino) that this will have the geeky ""fan-boy"" target audience hunched over, furiously loving every minute of it."
"flash-98","3","17","34","22 September 2005"," The sin of Sin City
","Predictably, some critics have labeled Sin City a 'gorefest', have dismissed it as yet another example of tarantinesque gratuitous violence designed to appeal to the crudest instincts. If only it were that harmless: in my opinion this film is a manifestation of a disturbing sexual pathology lying deep within the American psyche. Worse still is that it seems unlikely that its makers were unaware of what they were doing while they created and then released this pathogen into the world. For many years now psychoanalytic knowledge has been in vogue amongst filmmakers, and in particular screenplay writers, there being numerous books, symposiums,etc devoted to this trend. <br/><br/>Sin City deconstructed <br/><br/>From a psychoanalytic point of view the film is messy and confused: numerous substitutions and role reversals come into play, making it hard to identify any clear-cut syndromes, and at times it's even as though neuroses are battling each other for supremacy. Despite all this mess it is possible to point out a number of prominent emotionally significant features present in the film, motifs which are not exactly subtle, given the heavy-handedness and emotional loudness which are typical of films by Tarantino, (here only a guest director). <br/><br/>Firstly, there is the film's heavy glorification of women: although nearly all the film's female characters are hustlers who injure, mutilate and kill men, women are excessively glorified, almost deified: ""She smells like angels ought to smell, the perfect woman...the Goddess. Goldie"" (Marv). <br/><br/>The adoration of women, often at the expense of reduced sexual feeling, often indicates what Freud called'castration anxiety': One coping strategy for the sufferer involving an effort being made to demonstrate to the threatening father-figure the 'cleanness' of their feelings toward the mother-figure. Sexual feeling toward all women may eventually become habitually sublimated into a chaste glorification. But, to complicate things, one of the role-reversals in the film involves castration anxiety being safely acted out in that the 'little boy' wins the mother by turning on and defeating (usually by mutilating or castrating) a threatening father-figure, (and sometimes the mother-figure herself performs this task). And no less than four acts of castration are graphically depicted in this film. <br/><br/>Most of the film's villains live in order to exercise sadistic violence toward females: they are violent and threatening father-figures, unworthy of the affections of the mother-figure. The only sin an inhabitant of Sin City can commit is hurting a woman, and revenging that hurt (always using extreme methods), is the only virtue and the sole motivation for the film's 'good guys'. The sickening violence in the film is in this way legitimized: made into a 'good cause'. And, strangely enough, the film seems to assume that the audience shares this value system. It is furthermore easy to interpret the numerous acts of mutilation performed on the male characters as symbolic castration : by being gravely injured, sometimes dismembered they are rendered powerless and impotent. <br/><br/>Most of the film's male characters, heroes and villains alike, are really put through the grinder, they are shot, cut stabbed, mutilated..and, well damaged in just about every way imaginable. And yet none of them shows any pain: it's as though their sufferings are unimportant, it's what they deserve. They seem to derive masochistic pleasure from this treatment, are positively invigorated by it. (An extreme example of this is the Buddha-like serenity shown by the character played by Elijah Wood after being dismembered, partly eaten by a dog and finally, decapitated). <br/><br/>Like Bruce Willis in one of his earlier films, Die Hard, the picture's 'good guys' undergo bodily mortification and suffer all sorts of injuries and hardship in order to avenge or rescue a female mother-figure, (in Die Hard represented by Bruce Willis's wife). <br/><br/>For a lot of masochists the overcoming of physical pain is felt to be an act of purification: the masochist 'paying' for having shameful sexual feelings. It is also noted that for many masochists these shameful feelings stem from homosexual urges. And sadomasochism, as we all know, does indeed figure large in 'gay culture', which has several sadomasochistic icons: the passion of Christ, and the martyrdom of Saint Sebastian (who was tied to a post and shot full of arrows), being the most prominent. <br/><br/>Combine this with the heavily-overstated unresolved castration complex and mother-fixation and you have a reasonably solid case for interpreting the film as a sort of tour-de-force of homosexual angst. This interpretation does not seem to apply to all cases. Sometimes the guilt feelings cannot be suspected as having their source in homosexuality : Bruce Willis's later relationship with the girl he saved is obviously incestuous ,""I'm old enough to be your grandfather"", and after a passionate kiss in a motel Bruce Willis finds himself with a noose around his neck. <br/><br/>It is no coincidence at all that such a film, one which seems to be maliciously working overtime to corrupt and pervert a young audience, is a faithful transference of a comic book onto celluloid. The creator of the Sin City comic series, Frank Miller, is credited with the screenplay for this film. In the past the corruption of youth seems to have been the aim of many comic book writers. In fact the problem got so bad that pressure groups were formed to combat it. It is an interesting trivia fact of comic book history that DC Comics was brought into life in order to create an alternative to a genre which had become characterized by violence and perversion. <br/><br/>Sin City can thus finally be regarded not as a worrying new trend in film-making, but rather as a relic from a past best forgotten: an undeserved tribute to a corrupt art-form."
"amirig","1","24","51","3 June 2005"," Stupendously awful
","First I have to admit: I have never read the comics, because I usually dislike comics. Then again a film should stand alone as a film regardless of it being an adaptation of anything, be it a novel, comics or anything else. Indeed the cinematography in Sin City is interesting and the aesthetics is stylish and glittery. But that doesn't change the fact that Sin City is truly awful. It is perhaps one of the worst films I have seen in years. Its 124 minutes were excruciatingly dull, devoid of humour, interest or even a narrative that actually makes sense. Who cares about a disfigured bully on a campaign of mutilation, a violent cop craving for sex, or a good whore saviour fighting a bunch of Irish grenade freaks jumping out of no where? None of the characters have any human attributes to them. They all fail to become nothing more than cartoons. Sin City is boring, self indulgent, superficial, idiotic, childish, and perhaps more pertinently of them all, lacking any substance or insight with which I could identify as a viewer. It is nothing but meaningless fluff. There is something profoundly American about Sin City, and about the enthusiasm with which it is received. It is a vacuous concoction of all American themes, from the rotten cop to the good hearted criminal and the benevolent prostitute, packaged through recycled motifs and images of American consumerism. But it has no narrative, no tangible metaphor, nor any inkling of a remark on life or human existence. It is, to quote the lead character of 'Fight Club', a ""copy of a copy of a copy"", which amounts to nothing more than the collection of images that it reproduces. Like the fake tans and breasts which dominate Santa Monica beach, Sin City is nice to look at, but very unpleasant to touch. Behind the pretentious stylishness is an orgy of violence, sexism, chauvinism and fetishism, which is basically two vile and boring hours about nothingness."

","The trailer to this film advertises falsely. ""Sin City"" is unrelieved sadism. I find it hard to understand that some moviegoers will protest ""bad messages"" in a film like ""Million Dollar Baby,"" but no one, not NPR, or the Onion, or any respectable media reviewer, seems to find any problem in watching people with their limbs sawn off eaten by dogs.<br/><br/>I stupidly sat through the film waiting for it to change or for some kind of pay off in irony, insight, or intrigue. It never came. Instead, I felt a lot like the characters tortured to death in slow, pornographic splendor.<br/><br/>I hate to draw conclusions what this degree of prurience says about our society, especially when one thinks of horrible abuses of power everywhere: in the armed forces, in politics, in business, in churches, in schools, in cars, pretty much anywhere.

"BrandtSponseller","10","14","27","25 April 2005"," A Noir Exploitation Masterpiece
","Primarily based on three Sin City graphic novels by Frank Miller--The Hard Good-Bye, The Big Fat Kill and That Yellow Bastard--the film tells a non-linear story centered around three primary threads. In the first, Hartigan (Bruce Willis) is a seasoned cop who is about to retire, but not until he saves a girl from Rourk Jr./Yellow Bastard (Nick Stahl). In the second, Marv (Mickey Rourke), a hulking brute of a man who looks a bit like (and has the physical prowess of) Hellboy (2004), tries to track down a woman's killer. And in the third, Dwight (Clive Owen) tries to protect Shellie (Brittany Murphy) from Jackie Boy and his thugs (Benicio Del Toro). Although at first it feels more like an anthology film, writers/directors Frank Miller and Robert Rodriguez eventually tie all the threads together in a very clever way.<br/><br/>Sin City is the rare comic book film that should please purist fans of Frank Miller's work as well as viewers who aren't familiar with the comics. It has an incredibly unusual visual style and plot structure, and it is extremely visceral and humorously cynical. Film noir is an obvious influence, as is the gritty, gory and sexy exploitation approach of Quentin Tarantino, who ""guest directs"" a segment of the film.<br/><br/>Visually, Rodriguez very closely matches Miller's stark black and white style, complete with the exaggerated perspectives and angles typical of comic book art, by shooting his actors digitally in front of green screens. Backgrounds are then put in by computer. A number of shots are identical to panels from Miller's comics. That everything is digital enables a number of fantastical ""camera"" transitions and an often surreal physics--made most conspicuous in the shots of vintage automobiles that frequently race along a winding, precipitous mountain road (somewhat similar to Los Angeles' Mulholland Drive) high above Sin City, as well as during the frequent bouts of spectacular violence. Both of these aspects are frequently accompanied by splashes of color, ala Francis Ford Coppola's Rumble Fish (1983).<br/><br/>Violence is extremely important in Sin City and it's one aspect where Tarantino's influence, especially his more recent work on the Kill Bill films, is most clear. This is Sin City, after all, so one shouldn't expect characters and behavior that would please the morally conservative right wing in the U.S. Except for Hartigan, even the heroes are wantonly hacking off limbs. Not that Hartigan isn't violent, but his violence is more traditionally retributional against the ""immoral"". Most of the women in the film are prostitutes, strippers and such, and most are either skimpily dressed or naked. They are also fond of powerful weapons, ala the ""Chicks with Guns"" segment from Tarantino's Jackie Brown (1997), which itself is rooted in 1970s exploitation films. If that's not enough to get the ""Moral Majority"" up in arms, my favorite segment--the story of Marv, features a religious leader as the big, cannibalistic villain. And even though Hartigan is the relative ""good guy"", he ends up in love with a woman whom he first met when she was 6 years old and he was nearing 60.<br/><br/>Surely many of these non-conservative elements will turn off viewers with more delicate sensibilities, and cause some others to search for a more mainstream ""moral"" message beneath the veneer, as has been done in not a few other reviews. I think there may be subtexts, but I don't think they're necessarily anything mainstream. The subtext is more an exploitation aesthetic taken to an extreme, offering (at least slightly) alternative mores. Sometimes the mainstream (especially the left and pacifist-leaning side) gets wrapped up in believing that everything must serve their desired message or be damned. Art shouldn't only have one kind of ideology behind it. It should say challenging things. I believe that's more the message of Sin City, if indeed there is one, than any kind of damnation of ethical anarchy or violence through an exaggerated, parable-like example.<br/><br/>With such a huge cast, one would think that Sin City would quickly become a confused quagmire of plot threads. Rodriguez and Miller deserve much credit for keeping everything clear and easily understandable, even despite a lot of motor-mouthed, jargony character narration (somewhat like a psychotic, anti-social film noir on speed) and the circuitous timeline.<br/><br/>The cast is excellent. Willis is every ounce the action hero he ever was. Owen should be an action hero (why had I never noticed him before?). Rourke is transformed into a hulking, unstoppable behemoth whom you love even though he's killing more people, in more brutal ways than Jason does in four or five Friday the 13th films--and all just because a hooker slept with him for one night. Del Toro is deliciously evil. Elijah Wood, as Kevin, is extremely creepy. Jessica Alba, as Nancy Callahan, is incredibly complex, not to mention beautiful. Devon Aoki is exquisite, elegant and equally beautiful, even as she's chopping off heads. I could go on and on, but you get the idea.<br/><br/>As great as the cast is, they cannot trump the biggest star, the overall style of the film, which surprised me just as much for its mordant humor as its intense action-oriented brutality. It may take a couple scenes to become acclimated to the unusual approach, but it is well worth it. Sin City is a film that can likely be watched over and over again, acquiring new appreciation on each viewing. If you're at all a fan of any of the cast or crew, or if you enjoy film noir and don't mind violence, you can't afford to pass by this film. I have a feeling that its unusual tone and structure will likely be very influential in the future."
"knull","Null","19","39","5 April 2005"," Over Hyped Gore Fest. Most Violent Movie Ever!
","Well, I watched the much anticipated ""Sin City"" last night. I can honestly say that is the most violent movie i have ever seen. Remember the overkill death scenes in Kill Bill. Its like that... on crack. There were more dismemberments than Saving Private Ryan, and beheading that would make the Highlander cringe. Not just with a sword either, one guy uses a hacksaw! And Bruce Willis even pulls a guys entire ""package"" off with his bare hands! Elijah Wood's character was cool, even though he had women's heads mounted on his wall, and ate their bodies alongside of his dog/wolf. Bruce Willis, and Jessica Alba were the only two characters that i actually liked. They didn't really expand on anyone else. Who needs character development when you have all those guns and blades? I found myself getting bored despite all the killing, and was looking forward to it being over. This has to be the most over hyped movie of the year. I enjoyed seeing all those stars in it. Its a shame that even with Directors: Robert Rodriguez, Frank Miller, and ""special guest director"" Quienten Tarantino that the talented actors didn't have better directing. It was like watching a two hour ultra violent Max Payne video including the cheesy detective commentary. <br/><br/>The visuals were great. It gets high points for originality. I loved the BnW with just a splash of color to accent certain aspects. The BnW helped hide some of the CGI effects. With the all star cast, the originality of the video transfer it has such great potential. What we get is an OK storyline, Extreme excess of blood, and violence, moderate amounts of nudity, and good acting. <br/><br/>Its worth watching just for the experience, but its not one that when its over you think ""Wow, that was a really good movie. I'm definitely going to buy that on DVD"". I would't call it a bad movie, its just a disappointment."
"snottyscotty150","10","16","32","15 May 2006"," the best comic book film
","I loved reading two of the Sin City books in this film, one of which is the famous and first in the series ""The Hard Goodbye"" it's the story of Marv, who is played by Mickey Rourke and he does an amazing job, he basically wakes up to find out that Goldie is dead, and he then goes on a rampage to find out who done it, don't worry what I said doesn't give any of the story away.<br/><br/>The one thing that stands out in the whole film is the way that it looks, it's very much like Sky Captain and the world of tomorrow, in terms of it's a very 1950's comic book feel, but this however is done in the better way. It's done in Film Noir basically another way of saying ""like kill bill"" everything is a bit over the top, such as the gun shots and the blood, etc. but thats the idea of the comic. The film is also done in a monotone effect (thats right your thinking what the hell is that) in other words only the primary colours are shown (so red, blue and yellow).<br/><br/>The opening scene to the Marv story is scene for scene the same as the comic, while I sat and watched it on DVD I had to go and get my comic book from upstairs in my room and see how close the book it was, and believe me it's perfect. I thought that Batman Begins was close when I saw that but then this come out and I thought perfect.<br/><br/>However I preferred the Hartigan story ""that yellow Bastard"", I thought that this story was better in terms of the way that it looks as a posse the the story (though the story is excellent and Bruce Willis is Hartigan, Mickey Rourke steals the spot light in this film) the Night club scene is the best scene ever when the lighting changes, and the whole editing is spot on, it's again how the comic is.<br/><br/>Most of my friends were put off by the Black and White effect and found it to be a bit dull, however with the Special Edition version (which you should get because it has an extra 30 minutes) you see it all in colour and see that it's so much more different. For my A level media project I actually used the Sin City style and watched it in colour and could see how much of a difference it made.<br/><br/>There are other famous actors and actresses in this film Jessica Alba, Benicio Del Toro, Michael Clarke Duncan, Michael Madsen, Clive Owen and Elijah Wood and they all do amazing performances. If you like the Sin City comics then you will love this film, it's true to the comics, and is actually directed by Frank Miller (creater of Sin City) it's perfect in the way that it's shown but I think to get the most out of it you need to see the Extended edition, it's a bit more expensive but it does explain the story and also you don't have to worry about watching them all you can watch the one you want when you want."

","First, I don't know the comic book, and I don't care.

People are shot and fatally wounded again and again and still live on. When they finally die, how can I believe that they're really dead? Pathetic.<br/><br/>There is constant violence. Neither does the violence hurt nor is it fun or beautiful or provocative or does it say anything else apart from the author/director saying: ""Look how proud I am of my sick mind"". It's simply childish, cynical violence without any meaning. Disgusting.<br/><br/>This film was meant to look great, to be a feast for the eyes, right?. How come there's NOT ONE SINGLE frame in it that I could call a ""beautiful shot composition""? How is that possible? Even Lars von Trier's endlessly dreary ""Dogville"" had one beautiful picture in it. If you like Black and White and Film Noir, go see the classics: ""The Big Sleep"", ""Kiss me Deadly"", ""Out of the Past"", ""Rogue Cop"", ""Killer's Kiss"", anything.

"Nozze-Musica","8","18","37","24 April 2005"," How do I Hate Thee Let Me Count the Ways
","How do I Hate Thee Let Me Count the Ways Before I watched this sorry excuse for a movie I had some ideas for some of the worst movies ever. This is very close to the worst movie ever made, if not the worst movie ever. Every movie that won a Golden Raspberry should be an Oscar contender compared to this. The plot revolves around the various citizens of Basin City, nicknamed Sin City. This is a town full of corrupt cops, murderous prostitutes, rampaging lunatics, evil priests, and any other vile character you can think of, with no good guys in the town Sin City sounds like a decent nickname. This movie is nothing more than an exercise in violence, gore, some sex, mutilation, cannibalism, flying blood, murder, and almost anything else designed to disgust your average viewer. The rampant violence had no real point, the extreme, and sometimes sickening scenes seemed to be there for no reason, but no, this is art. Sure murder and cannibalism have so much artistic expression. This movie has the artistic expression of a broken pencil, but there's probably someone that thinks a broken pencil has artistic expression, after seeing this movie I don't know what to think.<br/><br/>I don't know how people can get shot 40 times and get minor injuries. People can get punched and it doesn't even scar them. Violence is so glorified and worse so unrealistic here. I have been assaulted, it is not fun, there is no glory in it, nothing fun, getting beat up is not nearly as vogue as it is here. If I had been shot 40 times I would not be laughing about it I would be dead. I have not seen a movie that glorified violence as much as this movie. This film makes sheer violence for the sake of violence look like it's all a game. The second most violent movie is like the Care Bears compared to this. Sin City tries to create an atmosphere of film noir. It is in black and white, and shot in a unique film noir camera style, giving the movie an interesting premise. The film starts out fascinating, and fairly interesting, but after 20 minutes the movie bombs. I never thought I would say the best part of a movie had Josh Hartnett in it.<br/><br/>Some promoters said nothing like this movie had been seen before, neither had the Hindenburg, but that doesn't mean it was a good thing. This movie has the distinction of being the most violent movie and the most boring movie ever made. I looked at my watch more than a few times during this movie hoping it was over. I wanted to fall asleep, and I wasn't tired, the movie dragged on and on for more than two hours and had virtually no points of interest past the beginning. I never knew a movie could be this boring, but yet again I was proved wrong, this movie makes dripping water look interesting. Part of the reason this movie was so boring were the characters, I can understand over the top acting and characters, but the acting in this movie was awful, their characterizations made the acting the quality of a first grade play. I have never seen a group of characters so unbelievable and so awful, to the point that just looking at any of these people is revolting. Even with a cast of Bruce Willis, Clive Owen, Rutger Hauer, Michael Clarke Duncan, and so many others should be at least decent. It isn't. The most repulsive of the characters is Rosario Dawson a dominatrix prostitute who leads a bunch of hookers in trying to save the lot of whores from a pimp who wants to control them. She gives bad acting a new idol, I hope I never have to see Rosario Dawson try to act again. All she does is add to this movies sexist tone. Almost every woman, if not all women are victims, who must be protected by strong men, women for the most part are unable to take care of themselves, and every woman in this movie is a sex object, someone who is valued primarily if not solely for sex, in some capacity.<br/><br/>The movie has some attacks on politicians, police, and especially the Catholic church, and the city tries to resemble a major American city, but none in particular besieged by corruption, poverty and crime. But as everything in this movie does, it is all taken to the extreme. Any minor or marginal social commentary becomes an excuse for more violence, or another way to try and shock the audience. I can see immature people, especially kids saying ""Hey cool you can shoot someone 50 times and they can still be alive!"" And you know this could happen, if it happened with the Three Stooges, who knocked each other on the heads with hammers and wrenches, and survived unbruised, it could happen here. If you are considering watching this movie (And I strongly advise against it) Keep in mind the only thing that kept this movie from being NC-17 was due to the fact it was filmed primarily in black and white. I think this movie still should have had an NC-17 rating, this movie was very very very very violent, and too much of the gore was shown in color for my taste. I wish I had never seen this movie, heard of this movie or had anything to do with this movie. Sin City is like looking at day old road kill: and you wish you hadn't looked at it. Both will probably make you gag, they both have that same kind of effect. If you want to see a good comic book movie watch Spider man, that is fun to watch, this movie is horrible, beyond horrible to no end and if you paid a cent to see it you wasted your money."

","Frank Miller, Robert Rodriguez, and Quentin Tarantino are no doubt thanking their lucky stars that there is a new generation born every day that has no memory of what went on before their birth. I say this because I read comments to the effect that this is the most violent mainstream film ever or such rot. Calling Sin City violent is like calling an Archie comic strip erotic. Nonetheless, this would not be a problem if the film did not have such a hype train following it, telling all and sundry how cooooooooool it is. What Sin City is, well, I describe it as being forty-five million dollars worth of digital imagery in search of a plot or an enjoyable cast. For around two hours, one spends the entire time watching distracting scenery pass by as actors recite lines they clearly are uncomfortable with and act in nigh on total darkness. Half the time, actors cannot be made out because of how dim the images are. One could be forgiven for thinking that Mickey Rourke's makeup was a dog dropping face mask.<br/><br/>If there is a saving grace to the film, it is Jessica Alba's portrayal of the nineteen year old Nancy. She gives the character a human edge that the entire rest of the film utterly lacks. She still has too much of a tendency to speak like a Californian stoner when it is inappropriate, but in the absence of a human quality in any other part of the film, I will take whatever I can get. Bruce Willis also manages to make a decent fist of his role, but the almost complete surrounding in green panels makes it difficult for him to react. Actors will tell you that the eyes are one of the most vital acting tools, but so too is the sheer ease of having something to react to. In their scenes together, Willis and Alba really give the impression of a pair who met when one of the inviduals was a mere eleven years old. Unlike the rest of the film, Willis and Alba manage to build an emotional investment in their scenes. One constantly hopes that things will work out for this mismatched pair, even though the rest of the film makes it clear that things working out is not an option.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, it is the selling point of the film that becomes its undoing. Professed by some to be an overly violent film, Sin City only demonstrates how much more squeamish cinema and audiences have become since the late 1980s. Much like Death Race 2000, none of the ensuing violence in Sin City looks real. Making it worse is that characters are repeatedly shot, blown up, or jump through panes of glass without suffering any of the injuries one expects from these events. After watching the end of Ransom or a true ultra-violent piece like RoboCop, Sin City comes across more like a no-consequence piece like Narnia than any sort of brutality. The almost-monochrome photography helps matters little, forcing the eyes to strain whenever the luminance does not quite jibe. Scenes in which Elijah Wood's glasses shine into the camera are particularly annoying in this regard, becoming bright enough to cause headaches in the photo-hypersensitive. Are Hollywood directors really so out of story ideas that they have to make their films unique by excluding nonstandard individuals?<br/><br/>Actually, the idea this film has that lots of fake blood and gore is any substitute for consequence when depicting violence is not so surprising. One of its helmsmen was involved with the second and third RoboCop films, if that tells you anything. Quentin Tarantino is a moron who thinks that individuals talking about how hardcore they are is any substitute for individuals showing the audience how hardcore they are. Robert Rodriguez gives it his best shot, but the man has not directed a decent film since Desperado. It seems the amount of cash one allocates to his films and his ability to make something out of it are inversely proportional to one another. Sure, he can do a lot of easy tricks and timesavers with his digital camera, but the story or sense of adventure seem to fall by the wayside. Add these three together, and you have a problem. There is an old saying that too many cooks spoil a broth, and three directors is certainly my idea of too many. One can almost tell who directed which segment by taking careful note of the clashing visions. While Frank Miller's vision of his own comic book won out for the most part, having an author adapt his own work is not always a good thing (Maximum Overdrive, anyone?).<br/><br/>I gave Sin City a three out of ten. It is not bad enough to be good, but it is better than the mediocre garbage I normally give a two. Aside from its tedious subject matter and artificial dialogue, there are some legitimately effective shots in the film. Elijah Wood puts on a nothing-face like no other, convincing me the boy might have some talent after all. So I guess you can say that the film did in fact achieve something."

I find myself now providing a comment on SIN CITY that may provoke a similar reaction in others. I can see by many comments here that there are those who loved the comics (I do not know them) and those people I suppose will be mystified by my reaction to this film. I hated it, and very rarely do I hate a film. I like all types, including PULP FICTION, and even SEVEN, and two of my favourite films are FARGO and VERY BAD THINGS, so violence, per se, does not worry me. However, today I walked out on this film and I have never done that before.<br/><br/>Why did I dislike it? I found it almost pornographic in its enjoyment of violence, torture and gore. I really felt that those aspects, of what I consider to be the dark side of our humanity, were being presented to us to enjoy and to get kicks from. I found this abhorrent. I recognized the great skill in the making of the film but, for me, it was just too terrible in its aims. Here in Australia there has been a little controversy about a varvellous (to me) film about Padophilia (rated R) called MYSTERIOUS SKIN involving an attempt to ban it. SIN CITY is rated MA (one classification lower than R) and I have to say that that mystifies me."

I think it can have a tremendous effect on many young people that are mostly without moral education or have no morally acting role models (and I don't let any Walt Disney type corny family morals count here!!!!), because the film basically says: Slaughter is cool and manly and the straightest solution to conflicts between people and if you drop some cool lines when killing someone or mindlessly exaggerate the violence it can also be funny as hell! Everyone who has seen somebody being murdered in real life, wouldn't understand why people would think its funny!!! I hope that people will get sick of these dumb orgies soon and Rodriguez and Tarantino will try to think of some plots instead.

The women are all helpless damsels in distress--even the gun-toting prostitutes of Old Town, who do little to help themselves while Clive Owen pretty much single-handedly saves the day. He does have help from Miho, a Japanese woman who of course wields an arsenal of ninja and samurai weapons instead of guns, as well as possessing seemingly supernatural powers. That's just one example of how the film relies on shorthand to tell us everything we need to know about the characters so that it can fit in more killing.<br/><br/>It pains me to see so many comparisons to film noir. This film has more to do with the ultra-violent comic books of the 50s that prompted the Comics Code Authority to censor them, nearly wiping out the medium altogether. My question is, if Rodriguez wanted to make a throwback to those books, why not make a film that shows that violence can serve a purpose in such a story, and should not be censored, rather than something based on how totally sweet it is to see people get shot?"

It isn't horrible necessarily because of all the casual murders, tortures, beheadings, dismemberments, cannibalism . It isn't horrible because it it composed of three story lines crudely stitched together like Frankenstein's head. It is horrible because it depicts a world--this world?--where there is absolutely no possibility of progress, no possibility of justice, absolutely no hope. A world where suicide--literally suicide--is the only answer. it is breathtaking in its depressingly sick nihilism. In the old Holllywood studio system a studio head would have looked a this script and said, ""Wait a minute..."" and writers would have been brought in. This movie, however, did not have the benefit of that and will be proof to Holllywood and the rest of the literate world that technogeeks are more interested in developing yellow color that doesn't run against a blue background than in producing a script with rising and falling action, catharsis, just depressing muddle.

And not only does the movie look like a comic book, but it moves like one as well; the tempo is brisk, and the lead characters are constantly on the go. Yet none of it's dynamic imagery and pacing compensates fully for the bland one-dimensionality of the lead characters. In the Spider-man movies, the viewer likes and cares for Peter Parker, who possesses, at the same time, superhuman powers and a nice guy personality. It's easy to empathize with Parker, who is shy and insecure but possesses the potential to accomplish so much more. By contrast, the lead characters in Sin City seem cynical and somewhat stoic, even as they scramble frantically across the city and its outskirts to accomplish various tasks."

After approx the first thirty minutes of this film I must say that I was pretty interested in the story only to be disappointed about half way through. The cinema photography was beautiful but unfortunately could not save the characters and plot which were painfully slow and boring to say the least. Again Bruce Willis has failed to provide any real good acting and Jessica Albas performance was shaky at best and a true disappointment. I felt that the movie as a whole left much to be desired.

"fedor8","Null","7","12","6 January 2007"," Idiotic but relatively fun comic-book nonsense.
","Plot-wise, this is as retarded as it comes. Quite obviously based on a comic-book  and calling it a ""graphic novel"" does NOT reduce its stupidity. Even worse, like nearly all comic-book-based movies it is based on US comics, which are the worst. And trust Rodriguez to use the SAME dialog as in the comic-book frames. This guy is a birdbrain, and this kind of vapid content is exactly what you'd expect him to put on the screen. The 3 stories are so full of holes and logic gaps that Superman, Hulk, and others seem like Stephen Hawking by comparison. And how about the comic's author? Well, this guy obviously has a cop-complex, because I have never ever seen this many corrupt cops, politicians and others in a movie before  ever. It would have made better sense to make Sin City a place without relation to the real world, and then a lot would have been forgiven, but making it part of the U.S. (or any real country) shows that Miller is just another dumb Beatnik, born the odd decade too late to participate in 50s Beatnik culture: i.e. shoving into each other their infected genitals and rambling about the world in senseless, silly poetry. Miller is obviously a left-wing moron (although, why add the adjective when it's implied anyway?) and the levels of paranoia he stoops to in his silly little ""graphic novels"" is something for a team of shrinks to analyze. On the other hand, shrinks can't improve your I.Q. which is probably why Cruise hates them so much (yes, yes, it's his sect, I know).<br/><br/>On the positive side, the cast is good, the visual style is pretty good and quite interesting, and the first story is quite fun. Another proof that Rodriguez isn't all-too bright is the fact that he actually placed the 3 stories in decreasing order of quality. The first story, with Rourke, is by far the best; fast-moving, unpredictable, and comic-book-like, but in a good way. The second story is solid, whereas the last story is by far the worst: totally, utterly idiotic  even for a comic-book movie. Too dumb. The cast: quite a few attractive women, and no silicone implants! Surprising for a dumb director, I must say. It's also amazing that he doesn't have a single ugly talentless actor in there, from the upper tier of Hollywood uglies, i.e. Diaz, Barrymore, Lopez and the other cretins. The male cast is also surprisingly devoid of pansies and other effeminate trollops (you know: Damon, Di Caprio, Bloom, etc.). The only casting decision that really sticks out in its silliness is Wood. I didn't believe FOR A SECOND that Elijah Wood could be a dangerous, acrobatic cannibal. (And soon he will playing Iggy Pop, I hear!!!) As for Rourke, he walks away with the movie, though in all fairness, he got the best part and the best story.<br/><br/>All in all, the movie isn't boring (apart from the last story which is a yawnfest of stupidity), and I know that I am supposed to switch off my brain when watching this kind of poppycock, but even comic-based movies ought to have at least an ounce of logic or intelligence. An ounce. Is that asking too much? It is from a Beatnik wannabe, and the dumb director who ""shot and cut"" this movie. (Did you know that Rodriguez named his kids Rebel and Rocket???!!! The other two are, I believe, called Road and something else dumb starting with ""R"".)"

Yes, the film is visually stunning and original to look at, but the film noir, Chandleresque narrative storytelling gets tiresome after a while, the violence is ridiculously over the top, and worst of all: behind the eye candy lies a pathetic concept that falls under the weight of it's own creator's ignorance, especially towards women. You've got to love people like Frank Miller who would swear that they're trying to make bold advances towards representing women equally by introducing female characters that are strong and independent, only to fall flat on his face in the process by making ALL of the female characters either hookers, exotic dancers, drug addicts, or lesbians. (Nothing against lesbians here, but my point being that EVERY woman in this film is the product of a MALE fantasy, and a sad one at that - sad as in the type of guys who are pushing 50 and live at home, go to comic conventions, and jerk off to Star Trek reruns). Miller clearly doesn't have a clue about women. Hell, even the purest female character here, an 11 year old VIRGIN (very important to state that here, as Miller thought to as well), can't resist the temptations of Sin City, as she matures into a 19 year old exotic dancer who has the hots for ""pushing 60"" Bruce Willis.

I love special effects but it looked way too real for me. There were no interwoven parts, they were parallel and that was confusing to watch. The idea or mention of any kind of violence toward children was disturbing also. At the end of the movie, I could only think that the author of this was a very sick person and did he have a goal on how many people were to be killed, like the more people killed makes the movie oh so much better?? and like seeing Jessica Alba nude would have made such a difference.

Did they not realize that they would be working on complete trash? <br/><br/>First of all, Rodriguez is not renowned for greatness. He's know for mediocrity; he's even more known because of his friendship with Tarantino. None of his films can be considered spectacular; his first major attempt, EL MARIACHI, was worth the viewing, but it all went downhill from there. So because of the fact that all of his films since his first attempt were less than wonderful, it can only be expected that his latest be even worse. And man, oh man did he deliver. There was absolutely NO artistic originality or integrity exercised on his behalf in SIN CITY. What did he do? He made Frank Miller's graphic novels into a movie. Word for word, bit by bit. And that's hard to understand considering the graphic novels; they are only truly known for their vulgarity and perversity. <br/><br/>So here we have this little film. Two hours and five minutes of sixty-nine million years on screen. It gives off the impression that it will explode onto the screen and choke the life out of its viewers. Instead, it CREEPS its way on and grosses you out with less than admirable writing(dialogue, etc.) and lame, lifeless, thoroughly non-engrossing story lines. The only plot line of the film that even resembles anything interesting is the main story, which revolves around Willis's character. It is violent and deplorable only for the sake of being violent and deplorable. EVERY BIT of nudity is entirely useless. The effects were cool to see; but if you want truly brilliant directing while dealing with entirely green-screen effects, go watch SKY CAPTAIN. <br/><br/>SIN CITY's characters bumble through their fabricated world like blind men in a musty maze. Rodriguez didn't direct this film, he simply enacted what need to to be done in order to show Frank Miller's work, which, again, is HIGHLY overrated. This film is disgusting and it is a disgrace to the art of cinema. Some will say that because of the approach taken towards this film and because of its ""originality"" it is worthy of high acclaim, but don't confuse greatness with experimentation. This was an experiment and it failed. It only shows what it shows and is the way it is in order to push the boundaries. And that need NEVER be done without a worthy subject or without making a statement on something important(usually to/about humans and human nature). <br/><br/>This one missed the mark by miles, and it is depressing to see the raving it's getting all across the country.

"Sheldonshells","1","19","42","13 July 2006"," base, banal, despicable in almost every conceivable way
","Typical nine dollar Hollywood detriment that reels in a lot of soul gutted fish to the theater. I got this movie for Christmas, and I quickly exchanged it for about ten bucks. My sister bought it for me for 30, but I was more than happy just to get some little amount for itjust as long as I was making some kind of effect, a motion, a protest to the three people I was negotiating with to hopefully get the point across that this is less than 0 dog plop(And I do apologize on behalf of all dogs' excrement everywhere to belittle it by comparing it to this, because excrement can be used for fertilizer, so then this decrement is more like mad cow diseased hamburger burned to ash.). I think it's a most terrible, damaging, oversight to comment only on the depiction of women in this film. What about the MEN!!! Yes women are often (but not always) seen as sex objects of desire (even though the nudity is toned down from the comics while the violence is all there and then someand of course the violence is almost ALWAYS inflicted upon men, those of you who comment on the violence against women in this film need to watch A LOT more closely once more, but no I would never actually suggest such a stupid thing to do!). However, the depiction of men is juat as bad if not worse. There is hardly a scene where there isn't some man being mutilated, castrated, or cut up and lopped up in every degrading way possible. A fair amount of this old hat and mindless gore is perpetrated by female characters (but that's o-k because they're hookers, right?)against only men; a scene where a woman gets slapped (a slap in this film is by far the lightest account of violence) is not even shown in full display, but as a shadow on the wall. I'm sorry but after seeing the gratuitous, pointless, trite violence in this film, I'm not seeing how this slap should be shadowed (perhaps Rodriguez and Tarentino didn't want to upset women because then they'd might get less ""tail"") In a similar degrading fashion, almost all the women are hookers or strippers (with the exception of the parole officer for the Marv character), yet the depiction of the vigilante hookers in Old Town is obviously seen in a positive light, no men in the film are treated with such reverenceand everyone complains just about the depiction of women?! I abhor the depiction of both men and women in this film. One might say that ""well, all the men who got killed are bad"" but that's below the point; the violent images themselves have an affect on an audience just as much as they have an affect in the context of something.<br/><br/>Another upsetting thing about this movie and together with certain misguided, thoughtless reviews is the chivalric dogma in which it wallows. Again, everyone talks about the sexist depiction of women (it's 2006 folks, let's start looking at the sexist depictions of both men and women, shall we?), well has anyone noticed the number of men who have sacrifice their lives solely for women in the film? For example that wretched, awful, gut-wrenchingly sickening character of Marv (and I ain't just speaking about how violent he is but that's definitely a part of it) who goes on a wild killing spree in the name of a one night wham bam with a hooker named Goldie? Really, if men weren't so cowardly to speak up about this, or weren't so incredibly deluded, there would be protests to this dogma. Sacrificing life and limb for women who show nothing but contempt or indifference to men is called oppression, too bad most men have not YET realized this. Clueless director Rodriguez(of, ya know, Spy Kids fame!!) obviously has no talent; look at what he ""accomplishes"": carbon copying something almost bit by bit from graphic novel stories from the early to mid nineties and this tricks a lot of suckers (re: this web page) into believing that he is a ""good"" director. He's a hack folks, pure and simple hack. And Tarantino hasn't made a good film since Pulp Fiction. The reviews here stating that this film and its positive reviews is an indication of how low our society has sunk are among the most perceptive and accurate ones; it is beyond passé to say that this kind of thing has no effect on how an audience reacts to real life. Films like these play well to all kinds of bad people, or latently bad people, and because there are so many deluded, delusional,bipolar, schizophrenic, lost,angry people, films like this prove to be a success (but don't worry we'll soon see that this will ultimately not be a success, ha, ha). It's not even a far stretch any more to say that maybe demons are infiltrating this ""realm"" at an alarmingly speedy pace when this film gets top ratings by so many so-called ""film critics"" as well as an 8 out of 10 rating on this website (fortunately though, there are a lot of no-nothings at this site). Even just five years ago I would have called someone a nutter for saying that thing about the demons, but really. Since this universe started with good and good has always won, I hope all the evil ones getting satisfaction out of their brethren reading this are not too satisfied(well, their brains are probably well liquefied or evaporated at this point, let's not be so cowardly to face it), because they will, of course, lose again in the short and long run, and good, quality, original films with integrity and a moral outlook will return sooner than later, let's just hope the littluns who ""loved"" this film are still young enough to learn the error of their tenuous beliefs, otherwise we'll have to wait another generation; oh well, I'll survive."

"Beaucoul","5","11","22","13 May 2005"," The Mainstreaming of Gratuitous, Sadistic Violence
","""Sin City"" is a flawless on screen realization of a graphic novel. If you allow yourself to be immersed, you could swear you're watching a comic book come to life on the silver screen. Characters are either monstrously hideous or impossibly gifted. The women in particular, accurately represent the febrile fantasies of adolescent and post-adolescent males. Buxom, statuesque, gun-totin' ass-kickers, they'd just as soon snap some slob's neck as wrap their legs around it.<br/><br/>I have to admit, I was immersed in this movie from beginning to end. I can recognize something new when I've seen it, and this movie is definitely not like anything I've seen before. A movie will score points with me just on that basis alone. However, not being a big fan of graphic novels, I doubt I'd be interested in seeing another film like it. As with most graphic novels, the dialogue in the film, recreated faithfully, tends toward tough guy/gal patter, which, with its inherent limitations, can get old fairly quickly. Most of the plots in these novels tend to be based on revenge fantasies (certainly the prime motivator in ""Sin City""), and I tend to think (wish?) that the well-adjusted of us typically grow out of the need for that kind of bloody retribution when we exit our teens.<br/><br/>On a side note, there are those who have taken exception to the way in which women are presented in this movie. They probably have every right. However, bear in mind that this movie represents the mainstreaming of a sadistically violent mindset traditionally limited to a coterie of readers of graphic novels. That mindset allows for a graphical realization of all manner of horrific transgressions that probably make the transgression of misogyny seem relatively tame in comparison. Perhaps a more relevant issue raised by this movie would be to ask why we are seeing the mainstreaming of this type of sadistic and retributive mindset at this point in our history.<br/><br/>Finally, as a counter to the feminist outcry this movie has engendered, there has been some ameliorative talk as to how the hookers, exotic dancers, and waitresses in ""Sin City"" are all ""empowered"" women, as if this could somehow offset the fact that almost all of the women portrayed in the film are hookers, exotic dancers, and waitresses, with nary a PhD in Marine Biology among them. Feminists should not go to this movie unless their idea of feminism is getting him before he gets you.<br/><br/>Somehow, this film feels post-apocalyptic. If you can get into that mindset, enjoy the ride."

The credits say Rodriguez ""shot and cut"" this movie, but to my eyes, it's all Tarantino. The entire movie seems to be one long series of contrived scenes that allow Tarantino to produce his vintage ""shoot them, cut them, decapitate them"" modus operandi scenes.

There are more subtle additions as the eyes of certain actors turn from b/w to their true colour and then back again. Obviously designed to capture the horror of the magazines it has been taken from, there were scenes of torture that could possibly have disgusted Edgar Allen Poe.<br/><br/>I don't know how far downwards Hollywood is going to have to go to create the next level of horror, as there is not much more that we can be desensitised to."

","I've just come home from seeing this movie, and I'm torn. I can't really decide how I feel about this one. On the one hand, you've got three terribly uninteresting crime stories. All three of them as clichéd as they can get. With characters so void of any emotion, it's impossible to feel for them. And on the other hand, you've got one visceral thrill ride of a movie. A non stop visual treat from beginning till end, that accomplishes what other blue screen movies can only dream of. To me this film is a close second to Tarantino's ""Kill Bill 1+2"" ... but it also suffers from the same weaknesses. Both films rely on grainy ""I'm gonna get revenge"" cool talk combined with overwhelming visual treats. Now Tarantino has proved he can pull off violent non story movies, but Rodriguez has always failed to do so in the past (Desperado,...) Luckily with this film he delivers such a feast for the eyes that you almost forget about the non existing storyline ... almost. Let's hope the sequel has a little more depth to it."

","Well, I think that no one could deny the visual effects of this movie. It was shot to resemble a comic, and the result is absolutely perfect. It makes you feel like you are watching a comic coming to life, animating just in front of you, leaving you stunned. The pure black makes the white so bright that it can blind you. Blood, lights, a tie... something will look like a hole in the screen. And it's is really captivating.<br/><br/>If we want to talk about the stories, well, I was a little unsettled by The Costumer is Always Right. Then I found out it was made to present the project to Miller. I still don't understand why this story was included in the movie, but it's OK. I mean all the credits are longer than the story itself, but...<br/><br/>The first. The first story it's my favorite. Maybe because it included some actors I love like Bruce Willis and Nick Stahl (I really think he is and amazing actor). For a moment, the story between Hartigan and Nancy unsettled me, and it stupid if you think about the amount of violence you can see in this movie.<br/><br/>The hard Goodbye fascinated me for its creepiness. Rourke is amazing in the role, but something about Elijah Wood in the role of Kevin, didn't felt quite right. I couldn't see him in that role.<br/><br/>The dialogues between a dead Del Toro and Dwight were something really interesting, and I really loved the idea about the cut on his throat affecting his voice. It was something absolutely special that made the scene even more creepy.<br/><br/>Many people said this movie was something like a huge hymn to violence, full of characters who didn't have any regret about their actions. What I liked about this movie is that very fact. Bad guys in this movie, are bad guys. They kill because they are son's of bitches, and they kill because they can and they have the power to cover everything. And the people who go against them know that, and that's why they don't feel any remorse for what they do. They torture and take their revenge in the most horrible of the way because they really think they deserve it. And bastards without remorse are my favorite kind of villains.<br/><br/>And, another thing I want to point out, is the amount of beautiful girls in this movie. I know it's not like a fundamental... no wait... Old Town is a place where basically whore are the law, they are like a sorority, protecting their business and their territory, and it looks like they have really high standards for their associates. And Rosario Dawson was absolutely breathtaking."
"jdkraus","10","3","4","31 July 2013"," Tribute to film noir with a mesmerizing visual style
","Film noir. A genre often about violent men stuck in a corrupt, crime-ridden city filled with menacing thugs and succubusses. The main character's situation is often a result of past mistakes, current mistakes, or just plain bad luck. This genre has been revamped over and over again, but not with such a strong flare as ""Sin City."" The movie itself is not only an example of the popular genre, but it is also like watching a comic book brought to life. Based off of the short stories from Frank Miller, ""Sin City"" is a unique tribute to the good old crime films combined with the visual style that Zack Snyder and ""The Spirit"" has copied from--desaturated tone, with strong emphasis on bright colors like red for blood, blue for eyes, and yellow for well...the yellow bastard. <br/><br/>To explain the story of this movie would be like trying to read its outline aloud. It is not necessarily complex, on the contrary, it is straightforward. The best way to put it is a collection of four stories spread out through the two-hour film, and they are somehow tied together. Sounds very similar to Quentin Tarantino's ""Pulp Fiction."" This is not surprising since he was a ""guest director"" for the film. That aside, the pace and various plots are never dull or pretentious. Each separate plot stands on its own yet has the magic to relate to the movie's whole picture. All very good I say.<br/><br/>The all-star cast makes this movie very impressionable. Mickey Rourke stands out very strong. The hard-ass he plays feels so in character for him, like with his wonderful work in ""The Wrestler."" It may seem unfair to mention Rourke first. However, each actor, no matter their length of screen time, fits their characters with sublime perfection. Willis, Owen, Wood, Duncan, Dawson, Alba--all of them match Rourke's caliber in this film. <br/><br/>In short, ""Sin City"" is a great movie for people with an acquire taste for comic books and film noir. The down-to-earth people who like to stick with romantic comedies and conventional action flicks may not like this so much. ""Sin City"" is not meant for everyone. It is full of gratuitous sexual content and bloody, stylized violence that ranges from cartoonish to borderline sadistic (cannibalism and castration are actions that are explored). As a viewer who relishes such debauchery put to the extreme though, I love it. A fun, visually gripping, and on occasion ridiculous, ""Sin City"" succeeds. It is unfortunate that Rodriguez did not take home an Oscar for Cinemaotgraphy."

","Hard to know what else to say other than what is in the title.<br/><br/>The genre of comic book requires reader effort and imagination to fill the blanks and join the dots between each frame. So this movie requires the same. Especially true of the more adult comics.<br/><br/>There is a mistaken assumption that comics, like science fiction are just for children. They can be for children, like most politics is. However, Frank Miller - like Philip K Dick or Kurt Vonnegut - write for adults.<br/><br/>You are not spoon fed anything, except excellent visuals and gloriously dark dialogue and authentic Frank Miller story lines.<br/><br/>The who's who cast list each give a glorious and iconic performance. They all wanted to be in this movie. It is worth understanding why they wanted to be there.<br/><br/>Thankfully, this movie has not Holywoodized the story in any way shape or form (unlike the first attempt at Dredd and the especially horrible adaptation of Electra: Assassin also written by Frank Miller and illustrated by Bill Sienkiewicz.) I hope you enjoy."

","Frank Miller is a graphic novel icon, his works becoming ever more popular due to the advent of numerous film adaptations. Probably one of the finest ever offered up to an audience has been ""Sin City"". I'd just like to note that while I definitely enjoyed the theatrical cut of the film, I prefer the extended cut. The special edition DVD (I thoroughly believe that blu-ray is a very big scam, and all I indulge in is the blu-ray player itself seeing as they boast it upgrades DVDs to 1080p regardless) allows you to watch each of the four stories in their entirety without the intercutting and you can watch them in any order you like. That being said, my personal favorite of the stories would have to be ""The Hard Good-Bye"", which stars Mickey Rourke as the bad-ass Marv who is after the murderer of his star-crossed lover Goldy (Jaime King). He's the probably the most masochistic of the protagonist (though rightfully so considering what he's up against) yet he still comes off as a very likable and you could say almost heart-warming character. Even though I enjoyed the ""Lord of the Rings"", I never cared for Hobbits but here Elijah Wood is fitting and plays the role of Kevin quite awesomely.<br/><br/>The movie has one of the greatest cast ever assembled, starring the likes of Nick Stahl, Carla Gugino, Bruce Willis, Rutger Hauer, Rosario Dawson, and yes even Jessica Alba in one of her few good roles. The world set up by Miller is brought to screen by Director Robert Rodríguez who does have a knack for stylish action films. One thing I definitely want to say is that of the many, many comic book and graphic novel adaptations Hollywood produces each year, this is probably one of the most panel-for-panel accurate ones out there. I would know, as an avid reader of Miller's work. The film, in a similar fashion to say ""Mulholland Drive"" or ""Batman: Mask of the Phantasm"", is a neo-noir treat, which if you're a classic film buff should be easy to see with its snazzy dialogue and distinct use of shadows. Plus the score by John Debney and Graeme Revell also alludes to this nicely. The use of CGI is elaborate but necessary to make a unique presentation for the visuals, which as I said before matches the books perfectly, right down to the awesome use of color.<br/><br/>The tales being told are violent, sensual but an awesome film experience not to be missed."

","Alright, I have to admit, I'm a fan of anything in the film-noir genre. But this simply blew me away.<br/><br/>At first, the story seemed a little hard to grasp since it started off nowhere, flew to another personage, gave me a sneak peak of yet another, and then went back along the road of person number two. By the end of the film, everything had become clear, and my only regret left here is that the characters of the three different stories never truly meet.<br/><br/>The camera, the acting, the gray blur... It was all exactly where it had to be. As the story truly kicks off with the beginning of Marv's story, you immediately get violently pulled into the movie. Marv might remind you of the incredible Hulk at times, but he's far from it. You hear him voice-over his own story as you see blackened glimpses of his wrecked face. When the story flips to Dwight, it's the ladies' turn to relieve their anger. The women shown in his part of the movie know how to row their own boat, and this is gruesomely but beautifully demonstrated while Dwight comments on his own story. Last but not least, Hartigan's story rolls over you like a tidal wave, as he fills you in on what happened to him since we last left him at the very beginning of the movie.<br/><br/>This is a movie in exactly the way that I like it; cold dead reality with a whiff of fantasy, filmed by a depressive camera while a man with nothing to lose adds in the fitting one-liners. I can't say anything for people who have read the book, but I can say this; If you liked the Max Payne games, go watch this. If you like a movie showing the slum-like sides of life, go watch this. And most of all; if you like art consisting of bullets, violence and depression, go watch this."

Clive Owen and Bruce Willis steal the show in their roles, and Mickey Rourke is very good as Marv (the first story we encounter). Jessica Alba can be pretty strong here and there, and Rosario Dawson is barbaric as a hooker, but in a good way.<br/><br/>The special effects, when used, are stunning. Of course the star of the film is the visual-style in which this stories are told, and it is absolutely mind blowing. The use of colors, and film noir black & white provide for surreal images.<br/><br/>The stories are clever, and well-crafted. I never would've thought of Elijah Wood as a cannibal, but it's so nicely done, it fits and doesn't lose the audience. Clive Owen's was the most entertaining, in my opinion, as it had all the elements of a good film, even if it was only 30-minutes. Bruce Willis' tale is very tragic, and is the second-best if I had to choose.<br/><br/>Overall, Sin Cit is visually amazing, and excellent in stories. Beginning to end, nothing is misplaced; the sensuality is great (mainly because the women are great to look at), the violence is extreme (a wolf rips at the severed limbs of Wood's cannibalistic psychopath) and the language isn't too bad (lots of S-words, and I don't think I heard any F-bombs).<br/><br/>I highly recommend this film to those who like artsy films with actual depth. With eye-candy and great stories to match, see Sin City.<br/><br/>Here's hoping that there's a sequel..."
"Knarlinggrimbob","9","3","4","1 September 2008"," Excellent noir
","Hey, this was noir for the 21st century! Sure the acting may ham it up a bit, but that's just aping the ""hardboiled"" style the director was aiming for. Slightly surreal elements - but hey, it's based on a comic! And as a fan of graphic novels this impressed me just as much as 300. Slightly odd choices in the casting actually work. Elijah Wood is creepy. Clive Owen is suitably rugged. (Though still needs to work on the US Accent). Alba equals very sexy. I guess Micky Rourke's continual plastic surgery finally paid dividends! The only part that doesn't really work is the whole ""Oirish"" terrorist thread - din't really work against the rest of the film."
"Tweekums","9","3","4","13 May 2008"," A Live Action Comic
","Watching Sin City is probably the closest thing to having a comic on the screen. The effect of having a black and white film with the occasional splash of colour is stunning. Where ever that colour is it draws you into that part of the screen, for example it was impossible not to look into Becky's blue eyes.<br/><br/>In another film the dialogue would seem forced and possibly silly but here it fits the tone perfectly, giving it both a Film Noir feel as well as being an over-the-top comic. The acting is solid both from the well known actors and the less well known ones.<br/><br/>I haven't read the original graphic novels so can't comment on how accurately the stories were translated to the screen but all three of the main stories were exciting and well told. It does contain quite a lot of violence but this too has a comic book feel so is less disturbing than the same acts would be in a more conventional film.<br/><br/>The action is set in the highly corrupt Basin City where there are few good people, the heroes of the film are for the most part people you'd cross the street to avoid in real life and the villains are evil people for the most part in positions of power or protected by those with power."
"Son_of_Mansfield","7","3","4","3 March 2007"," Watch any frame of Sin City and you don't have to imagine anything.
","All the colors and violence are laid on thick for a good reason, to cover the thread bare plot and the occasionally silly dialogue. But does it really matter? This is a wild and noir experience that is the best hybrid of a graphic novel and a film that I have ever seen. It may be over the top, but you can't take your eyes off of it. One of the biggest attributes is the stunning all star cast. The stand outs are Clive Owen, Rosario Dawson, and Mickey Rourke. Clive Owen could easily star in a modern noir with his deep voice and troubled looks, Rosario Dawson gets to be the bad girl with a pair of handcuffs and mohawk, and Mickey Rourke steals the show as the psycho Marv. He chews into the role and personifies the movie as a whole. Sometimes ugly, sometimes funny, always mesmerizing. Like it or not, it's a unique experience.<br/><br/>P.S. Exactly how many men in this movie lost their private parts? Eww."

","When Sin City first came out, I had no interest in seeing it. I had never been a fan of stylish black and white films or films that were based on comic books. And I had heard of all the grisly violence in this film and that made me not want to see it even more. But my cousin had told me all about it and kept telling me how great it was but I kept telling her that it just wasn't my cup of tea. But a couple of weeks ago I was trying to find something to watch on television and there was just nothing on I was interested in watching. So I saw that Sin City was on and turned it on there. It has already been on for like thirty minutes but I just started watching it and became enthralled and had to watch more. I couldn't turn it off! This was such a cool movie. I loved all the characters. My favorite character was Marv, played to perfection by Mickey Rourke. He had the best lines in the whole film. I'm not normally a Bruce Willis fan but he was great in this film too. Elijah Wood, in a change of character for him, was extra creepy as Kevin, the cannibal. And Clive Owen! OMG I loved Clive Owen as Dwight McCarthy. Besides Marv, Dwight was my favorite character. His sequence with Benicio Del Toro was one of the best scenes in the movie. This film was extremely violent and I did cringe on some parts, but it didn't' distract me from the film. I thought it was extremely well done, well written, well directed, well acted, and overall a great film. Sin City is one of the best films to be adapted from a comic book. I'm glad I ended up seeing it because it's now one of my favorite movies. Sin City rocks! Thanks for reading my review! ~LaTissa~"
"chancmeeting","10","3","4","16 August 2005"," Beautiful!
","This movie is beautiful; in the special kind of way that can only be done by the one who created it in the first place! And, thankfully, Rodriguez and Creator Frank Miller seemed to see the same thing! The movie's beauty is second only to the original Graphic Novels! Truly one of a kind (but, ironically, I can't wait to see the next one!) It is also a nice homage to the ""Film Noir"" era. The casting couldn't have been better; each actor/actress is made, or just happens to be tailored, to their role! Even if you aren't real excited by action and violence; your eyes will be glued to every frame of this movie. It's just that amazing to see! Definitely give it a chance; and you'll probably be in my place wondering which of the 4 DVD covers to buy!"

The best adaptation of a comic to date by a wide margin. <br/><br/>Damn.<br/><br/>The blend of real life, comic, film noir, black and white, color, Dashiell Hammett, Dark Knight on the art side and Bruce Willis (in a roll made for him), Josh Hartnett (who despite being prettier than most celebrity girlfriends is a great actor), Jessica Alba (unharmful to the eyes), Brittany Murphy (ditto), and Mickey Rourke (in the roll no one else on EARTH could have played) on the craft side...<br/><br/>Not that ANY thing or one in this movie isn't a child of, work of, or slave to...art.<br/><br/>Damn."
"cortinex","10","3","4","15 August 2005"," Visit Sin City: violent, dangerous, depressing... and absolutely awesome!!!
","Exactly my kind of movie I have to say.<br/><br/>The cast list is fantastic, the characters itself are fantastic (Marv just rocks!!) and the atmosphere of the movie is fantastic.<br/><br/>Nice alternation for the eyes to see a good old black and white- movie, you feel right back in the past. I liked the small amounts of color, especially Dwight's shoes and Goldie's hair. They give the movie some kind of... don't know, and that's what's so great about! And the black and white thing coupled with the voice from the off reminds me of the computer game 'Max Payne', making it even more atmospheric. <br/><br/>I think Robert Rodriguez did a great job. I don't know the comics by Frank Miller but I'm watching out for them, after I've heard that the movie is a nearly perfect copy of them.<br/><br/>And what I liked especially: no character in this flick is 'good', no one. Even the so called hero, Hartigan (man, I liked Bruce Willis playing this role), though he is all about saving Nancy Callahan's life, isn't so glorious, considering his final confrontation with the Yellow Bastard. Marv is just a psychotic crazy killer maniac, not even flinching from killing a priest (""Amen!"") and sawing off a 'boy's' arms and legs, and watching the dog eating them afterwards, but he all does this because of the only love he has ever had, the hooker Goldie, killed by the 'boy' (or whatever he is) Kevin. And Dwight, yeah, Dwight is also a special figure to talk about, because he comes close to Marv, concerning his bloodlust. In my opinion, Clive Owen is a great cast for this role, don't know why, but in my eyes, he just fits the image.<br/><br/>I have to thank Quentin Tarrantino for the scene with Dwight and the killed Jackie Boy in the car, because it's just so crazy and bizarre that this scene surely becomes copied in any way in the future. But they won't get it that good as good old Quentin did.<br/><br/>And one last word I have to say about the girls: FANTASTIC!!! So many pretty girls. Jessica Alba and Brittany Murphy are my favorites but also Rosario Dawson, Alexis Bledel and all the other girls are gorgeous.<br/><br/>So, there's only left to say: everybody who hasn't seen this movie yet: go into the next theater, buy a ticket for Sin City, sit down relaxed in your chair and just let the atmosphere suck you into the film. When it's over, you notice a small but urgent voice in your head, saying: ""Watch it again. Immediately!!!"""
"vanillacoke420","10","3","4","6 August 2005"," Fantastic, absolutely fantastic
","Before I saw the first trailers that had leaked out on the net, I didn't know about the Sin City graphic novels at all. But, simply by watching that trailer, my expectations became very high right away. I sometimes watched the trailer for fun, simply because it was so good, and promised so much. The other trailers that were official, promised even more. I've never waited so much for a movie since I waited for Kill Bill.<br/><br/>Did it keep its promise? It did, and more. The visual style was absolutely fantastic, with the movie being completely in black and white with splashes of colour here and there, such as a red dress, the flashing lights of the police cars or Bledel's blue eyes. The story lines were simple and straightforward. Some have called the movie shallow, and I suppose it was, but for some reason this is not bad in any way.<br/><br/>We're sent into Sin City for two hours and we get to see a different world, a world real and unreal... and it feels good! It's easy getting sucked into this strange parallel universe, where you can find anything. It's dark and exciting. It's a place where the men are raw and hard characters, and the women are cool and always beautiful. It's decades ago and it's today.<br/><br/>The acting was good. I didn't expect anything else with such an impressive list of excellent actors/actresses. Here are some of them, and what I thought about them: Jessica Alba is Nancy Callahan, a stripper at the Kadie's bar. Alba is doing a pretty good job, actually. Just about good enough for this role, but not any more than that, in my opinion.<br/><br/>Devon Aoki is Miho, one of the girls of Old Town. I don't think she says anything at all in the movie. Hard to say much about the acting, but it looked like she did her job.<br/><br/>Alexis Bledel is Becky, one of the youngest of the Old Town prostitutes. I have to admit I was curious to see Bledel in such a movie, after seeing her as Rory in Gilmore Girls. Except for a few weak moments here and there, she did a great job on the whole.<br/><br/>Rosario Dawson is Gail, one of the de facto leader figures of Old Town. I love the way Dawson did this character. Gotta love her mischievous smile.<br/><br/>Benicio Del Toro is Jackie Boy, a no good cop. del Toro must be some sort of acting genius. He is one of the outstanding actors in this movie, he is really, *really* good as Jackie Boy, even when Jackie is supposed to be dead.<br/><br/>Rutger Hauer is Cardinal Roark. Another small role in this movie. Even so, he's doing a great job.<br/><br/>Jaime King is Goldie/Wendy, twin sisters and prostitutes of Old Town. This is, as far as I remember (and I'm very sure) the first time I get to see her work. I think that her sensuality is created where her hotness and cool intersect.<br/><br/>Brittany Murphy is Shellie, a bar maid at Kadie's. Here is another one who does her job incredibly well. For a while we have Murphy and del Toro in the same scenes; a real treat. Murphy's facial expressions, gesturing, the way she delivers her lines - just sit back and enjoy. Ace performance by Murphy.<br/><br/>Mickey Rourke is Marv. Great character who beats his way through Sin City with fury and humour in order to find vengeance on whoever murdered Goldie. Rourke does it well.<br/><br/>Nick Stahl is Roark Jr./Yellow Bastard. A pedophile who is after Nancy, and after Hartigan saves her, he attempts to kill him. I'm not familiar with Stahl's previous works, I believe, but he certainly seems to play this part well.<br/><br/>Bruce Willis is Hartigan, a good cop. I recently saw Die Hard, and remembering Armageddon I have to say he doesn't seem to have a terribly wide range as an actor, but then again his roles usually doesn't seem to give much room either. For such parts, including the one as Hartigan, he's a good choice.<br/><br/>Elijah Wood is Kevin, one of the more terrifying characters. No lines for Wood, and it's not much he needs to do, I guess, except staring without expression, or trying to fight Marv.<br/><br/>It may sound like I'm raving about all the actors, but I hope it's also clear that in some cases I can't say much about the acting, and that in some cases it's great, sometimes good and sometimes weak.<br/><br/>Anyway, I loved this movie. Unfortunately it was pulled from the big screen in my city after only a month, and by that time I've seen it only four times. I'll just need to get the DVD...<br/><br/>This is an easy 10/10."

","Sin City is from start to finish a work of SIN-ematic beauty. Robert Rodriguez remained true to the source material, and kept it dark and gritty. The acting is superb, except from a few of the females. The violence is non-stop and unrelenting. I overly enjoyed myself during this movie, and found myself chuckling at a few scenes. Mickey Rourke is the best part of this movie, in my opinion, this could mark the beginning of a huge career for him. This movie is not for the squeamish or weak of heart. While a few may be offended by the violence, it is a necessary evil, due to the source material. Overall, this movie was very well directed, acted, and faithful to the original Sin City comics."

","The Sin City graphic novels are not only beautifully drawn, they have truly inspirational stories. The same goes for the movie. As I watched this movie I felt just about every emotion possible. I cheered when the yellow bastard got his balls ripped off, and I even shed a tear when Haritigan took his own life to protect Nancy. The actors and actresses played there parts magnificently, especially Clive Owen and Micky Rourke. Clive's portrayal of Dwight was one of the most believable performances I've ever scene. He can really play a paranoid murderer. Rourke was also the perfect choice for Marv, who is the greatest big screen bad ass I've ever seen. I can't wait for the rest of Miller's stories to hit the big screen."

","When i heard that the frank miller's stories was going to be adapted to the screen; i wasn't sure that it was going to work...but when i saw the movie..I just can say that Robert Rodriguez is one of the most creative and imaginative directors ever. He transported the dark and sad atmosphere of the comic to the screen of a fantastic way; the characters, the dialogues, the backgrounds; everything was almost perfect. The art direction was amazing, all the time you feel the darkness and injustice of the corrupted Basin City.<br/><br/>At the other side we can see the characters...the heroes of the stories. Practically, in my opinion, Mickey Rourke stole the movie with Marv, the twisted and strong killer that seeks revenge for the murderer of his lost love. But i have to say that Bruce Willis, Clive Owen and Rosario Dawson made an excellent work. In resume.. I recommend this movie..you must see it..it doesn't matter that you don't like comics...this is a masterpiece"
"leplatypus","10","3","4","12 July 2005"," Best comics adaptation so far BUT not for kids (screen)
","This is the proof that the author's intention (Frank Miller) has been respected.<br/><br/>The diverse comics of Sin City are for mature readers and the movie is the same. Whatever the reason of Miller for very hardcore violence (fighting for freedom of expression ? and the difficulties tied with this-an unconscious appeal for sadism ?), the Hollywood interest has not turned down the subject. Worse, the violence going from pencils to live action with real people, what was left to the imagination of the reader is now totally watched: So, even if i knew what would happen, i felt a bit shocked to see what was the reality of the drawings...<br/><br/>But, Sin City is a lot more than violence. The ""heroes"" believe in honor, strong code of value (and cynicism...), so you can't be disgusted. This morality surely explains why so-much Hollywood stars (Alba, Willis...) gave their will to do it. Mickey Rourke does an amazing performance. His mimetism with the comic character is evident. <br/><br/>In conclusion, every feeling of the comic book is truly present in the movie: the play with the black & white, the rare touch of colors (blue eyes baby, yellow bastard, babe wearing red), the dark atmosphere of the city,....<br/><br/>If i gave a very positive review of ""Spiderman"", I must admit that Sin city surpasses it, watching a wall-crawler can be entertaining, but watching a torrent of violence is educational ......<br/><br/>A movie with depth & forms deserves an award: ah Cannes, Maybe Oscar..."
"Lando_Hass","10","3","4","11 July 2005"," If you looked up the term ""bad-ass"" in the dictionary, you'd see a Sin City poster right next to it....
","I saw Sin City back when it came out on April 1st. It was a nice day. Birds were chirping, children skipping in the streets, old people sipping tea and reading the newspaper in their rocking chairs, and everyone had a smile on their face.but who gives a crap if that really happened? I sure as hell wouldn't, because on April 1st, Sin City came out, and as far as I was concerned, nothing else mattered. That's right, peoples. This movie rules so much ass, that if you saw it one day, and when you came home, you found out that a bomb of s*** landed on your house, you wouldn't care one bit.because you saw the orgasm-inducing Sin City. <br/><br/>Let me start first with bad-ass aspect number 1: The look. Just by watching pieces of the trailer, you can already tell that this movie will basically make your eyes orgasm. Instead of having a basic color scheme like every other movie these days, this movie is all black and white with little splashes of color here and there. This is probably the coolest looking movie on Earth. It eats every other movie for breakfast and s***s it out an hour later. <br/><br/>Bad-ass aspect number 2: The characters. The characters in this movie are so cool that you'll almost feel bad because people in real life can't pull of what some of these characters do. Example: (spoiler, for anyone who cares) Marv (Mickey Rourke) is in and electric chair. While the Priest is babbling on, he tells him something like ""I haven't got all night."" They pull the switch, he's gets electrocuted, then they stop the voltage. Bleeding from the mouth, he raises his head, and says, ""Is that all you got, you pansies?"" Then they electrocute him again! This character is so bad-ass that it took not one but TWO tries to finally kill him. Elijah Wood stars as Kevin, a messed up, psychotic religious dude who never talks, and never changes his facial expression. The fight between him and Marv kicks-ass, plain and simple. Nick Stahl plays as Yellow Bastard, a guy who looked normal once, but after getting a couple bullets in his package and various other places, he turns yellow because of the treatments he receives. This character stands out in the movie because he's yellow. That's all you need to know. He's weird lookin', he's crazy, and the fate of his character is brutal and harsh, which brings me to my next point: <br/><br/>Bad-ass aspect number 3: The relentless violence. Everywhere you look in this movie, blood, gore, bones, decapitations, explosions, everything you could want in an action movie. The characters often beat one another to death, sometimes with weapons, sometimes with guns, and sometimes with their bare hands. This might offend some people, but who cares? This is movie violence at it's absolute sickest and best. I know what's going on. I know that if you haven't seen this movie yet, and you're somehow still reading this, you're asking, ""But dude, everything you've explained is so bad-ass as it is. How the hell can it get any better? It's not possible."" It's possible. The fun doesn't stop at the violence, which brings me to my next point<br/><br/>Bad-ass aspect number 4: Hot actresses. This movie is full of them. Jessica Alba, Brittany Murphy, Rosario Dawson, Jamie King, Alexis Bledel, the list goes on. Never before have I seen a movie look absolutely cool, have kick-ass characters, relentless violence and nonstop action, and a horde of hot women. You can't watch this and think it's bad. It's just not possible.<br/><br/>Sin City is one of the most bad-ass movies of this year. Believe me. All of your senses will have gushing orgasms, especially your eyes. It's so bad-ass, it doesn't even need any Gwar tunes, and readers, a movie has to be really bad-ass to not need any Gwar tunes. <br/><br/>Score: 10"

"prendevi","10","3","4","24 June 2005"," One word sums this movie up: Masterpiece! *****(out of five)
","Kudos to directors Robert Rodriguez,Frank Miller and Quentin Tarantino for ''Sin City'' a landmark film. Its a landmark not only for the astounding cinematography (which mixes black and white and flashes of colour to sumptuous effect) but also Rodriguez's decision to bring the man behind the comic books on which this is based - Frank Miller- on board is throughly groundbreaking and gutsy. Rodriguez actually had to resign from the DGA to bring Miller on board as it was breaking their rules. But this decision well and throughly paid off and Miller's emphatic influence on the style of the movie is there to be seen. A third director-Rodriguez's buddy Quentin Tarantino- also came on board for a few days as a ''special guest director'. Tarantino directed one brilliant sequence with Clive Owen and Benicio Del Toro in a car on his own and also co-directed a few other scenes with Rodriguez and Miller.This is adapts Miller's books more faithfully than any movie based on something else before. And that is throughly what the genius that is Frank miller deserves. The film is quite simply a masterpiece and so far this is my MOVIE OF THE YEAR by a country mile and I really can't see it being topped. It ingeniously interweaves three of Miller's stories into one whole movie through a pormanteau structure similar to that of Tarantino's masterpiece ''Pulp Fiction''. The film is clever, fast-paced, exciting and sickeningly funny. The entire cast is superb but the standouts are Bruce Willis who excels as hard-boiled cop Hartigan, Nick Stahl who is terrifying as a deformed sadist known as ''Yello Bastard'' and comeback kid Mickey Rourke who is absolutely outstanding as violent thug with a heart of gold Marv.You simply cannot miss this film!"
"joestank15","10","3","4","19 June 2005"," A must-see for comic-book fans
","Sin City - A series of largely unconnected vignettes and directed by Frank Miller, Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino, Sin City just drips from comic book atmosphere and style. Be it the fact that everything is in various stages of chrome (and anything the directors felt you should pay attention to, such as blood, is overly colored), or that everyone smokes, or that there is more narration than actual dialog. The characters make most of the movie, rather than the plots, which are not that important. There's Harigan (Bruce Willis), the hard-as-adamantium-nails cop with a heart of gold for Nancy Callahan (Jessica Alba), as he takes on The Yellow B@stard (Nick Stahl). There's Marv (Mickey Rourke), who is pretty much invulnerable to pain, and kills with a warm smile and fun disposition. These two vigilantes, through their glorious comic book violence, make The Punisher look like a cream puff. There's also Dwight (Clive Owen), who similarly never seems to go down, and is very fast with his dual pistols. Oh, and I shouldn't even have to mention the super scary, super agile Kevin (Elijah Wood). You will remember him. There's more unique characters, but it'd take all day to describe them. The fight scenes are bloody and just plain jaw dropping fun, if you like that sort of thing. I do. There are some minor down points, mostly pacing. once or twice. The movie is kinda long near the end. And if you didn't like either of the Kill Bills for violence than you should stay the heck away from this. But to everyone else, you deny yourselves a treat by ignoring this film. A."

","There have been many movies based on comics: Superman, and Batman preceded ""Sin City"" by 20-30 years, and there's the current rash of Marvel offerings. M. Night Shyamalan's ""Unbreakable"" is a near comic book characterization. Until now, perhaps ""Dark City"" is the closest to come to an actual comic. Based on Frank Miller's ""graphic novels"" (OK, ""comic books""), this is the first movie that has the power, the look, and the feel of a comic book. Other posters will post a point-by-point plot of this movie, and it's not necessary to do so. This is a graphically violent film, with some very disturbing images - there are also also many laugh out loud scenes. Be forewarned: this is not a ""date"" movie, and certainly not appropriate fare for children.<br/><br/>Three stories are intertwined, juxtapositioning time and space just enough to keep you out of step. Scenes include 50's autos and plastic garbage bags, compressing time by 20 years. Perhaps it's a method to indicate that sin transcends time and space, race and age. Is it any coincidence that several of the major actors look like actors from other movies? Powers Booth reminded me of Gregory Peck in ""Boys from Brazil"". Rutger Hauer does a turn of Marlon Brando in ""Apocalypse Now"". With his cartoonish physique, angular face, and haircut, Mickey Rourke looks all the world as Kirk Douglas in ""Spartacus"".<br/><br/>The DVD will undoubtedly allow the directors a chance to discuss their individual and collective visions, and that will be a treat. The plot twists are sufficient to provide material for at least one sequel, and I can't wait."

","For the first time ever i'm giving a movie a ten, and the reason is that i don't believe this movie could have been done better. I'll admit, i've never read the comic series, but having read them is not a prerequisite for watching the movie. If anything i'm glad i didn't know what was gonna happen next. The world in itself is simply awesome (think Seven, in that it's always dark, it's always raining and then add some extreme violence and film noir inspirations), and the way it is shot (greenscreen all the way), gives them a chance to make the background seem like a comic, and in this they succeed all the way. The acting's amazing (what a comeback for Mickey Rourke!), and it's probably the hottest cast of girls ever assembled in one movie! Jessica Alba is (as we already knew) a really promising actress and the biggest knockout I think i've ever seen. All the guys at the cinema i was at literally went ""whoa"", when she first came on in the stripper outfit! I can't wait for the DVD, when we get to see the stories, as Miller and Rodriguez really intended for us to see them, and of course the sequels that apparently will be shot back-to-back ala LOTR. I've you haven't got a weak heart or blood phobia, see this movie. You will not regret it!"

","i didn't really know about Miller's Sin City series of comic books. I usually only follow in the Marvel tradition e.g Spiderman, Blade etc. but when i saw this film i was blown away. I'm not a big fan of film noir but i was amazed at how good this film was. the different tales of the characters intertwined perfectly, the cast was excellent (yes even Nick Stahl) especially Mickey Rourke!! Definitely one of the best films I've seen for a long time! I'm a fan of the director, Robert Rodriguez, ever since he made Desperado and i think he has done a fantastic job on this film, with a little help from Tarantino. I only have two things confusing me, though. First, why cast an English guy and have him do a very bad American accent, and secondly, what was the point of Josh Hartnett's character?? Apart from these two questions, everything else was perfect, and it's nice to see Bruce Willis back on top form again."

","I am not a big fan of comic books, but when i heard about a movie being made by Robert Rodriguez, I thought it should be interesting.But man!!! this one was awesome.The sincerity with which the reproductions have been made from comic book to the movie is really staggering.I seriously dint expect a movie on a bad city to be this good.The performances were uniformly exceptional and with seasoned actors like Bruce,Micky,Bencio,Rosario,Murphy the movie was really a treat to watch. I just loved Mickey's character, dunno whether the way he acted was true to the comic book but was one damn good piece of acting. Bruce can do these roles without even being given the script of the movie and Clive owen and Bencio were also pretty good.The surprise for me was the number of female leads in the movie.Elijah wood's role was pretty creepy along with a unrecognizable Nick. If you dunno anything about this comic book I would suggest seeing the movie would be a really good plan!!!!!!!!!!! True portrayal of a piece of sketch art........"
"lensman-4","10","3","4","18 May 2005"," AWESOME The movie for comic fans
","This movie is beyond AWESOME. The Rodriguez-Miller team was perfect. I don't think I could have wanted a better comic book movie than Sin City. All of the actors were awesome. I loved Mickey Rourke as Marv, and could Bruce have been any better for Hardigan? I cannot praise this movie enough. And, the fact that they took the comic panels and created the movie right out of the Graphic Novels is just amazing.<br/><br/>And, Jessica Alba was really really good as Nancy, after all of the hoopla over her not being naked in the movie, I think she pulled off the part of Nancy very well. You did not need her to be naked, she was able to convey that innocent nature within the context of her being a stripper.<br/><br/>I LOVED LOVED LOVED This movie, saw it twice, and would have gone for a third time if I had the chance. Will definitely buy this on DVD. The icing on the cake, THEY ARE MAKING MORE!!!!!"
"dslavchev","10","3","4","9 May 2005"," triumph of technology
","The good news is that directors Frank Miller and Robert Rodriguez have brought the nihilistic noir comic to the big screen without compromising the outrageous violence. But it's also kept the series' hard-boiled-to-death narration, which has all the grace of a fiery zeppelin. And while the carbon-copy visuals are impressive, the movie becomes less an adaptation than a replication. Some viewers will drool over the high ain't-it-coolness factor, but while the book succeeded in pushing the boundaries of its medium, the film merely feels like a triumph of technology. But this effort deserves confidence for 10 out of 10. Grand Merci Beaucoup."
"demosthenes_the_elder","Null","3","4","13 April 2005"," outstanding movie
","Sin City was almost all I could have hoped for. <br/><br/>They had to tone down some things to get the R rather than the dreaded NC-17... and at a guess a lot of the actresses have ""no full nudity"" clauses in their contracts (ie: I am certain of this for Jessica Alba)... but overall they maintained the integrity of the bleak and gritty tone of the books... and the visuals were dead on the money. <br/><br/>It was almost perfectly as if the graphics had come to life. It is pure art. Unlike Sky Captain, which bored me to tears in spite of its visual perfection, this movie also has serious plot substance, which illustrates some very human and even philosophical truths.<br/><br/>My only real complaint was the deadpan lack of affect the actors adopted for the voice-over narratives. I had always read the ""internal dialogs"" as having more emotive loading than was to be heard in the delivery in the movie. This was slightly annoying to me, though I recognize the resonance with old detective film-noir they were establishing. <br/><br/>As I have been a fan of Sin City since its first appearance in DHP lo these dozen or more years ago, I cannot even begin to imagine how one who has never read the books would react to the movie. I knew 100% of the plot and over 90% of the dialog before the first frame hit the screen, so I was not surprised or shocked by anything in the movie, and saw nothing I had not long anticipated. I knew the punchlines to all the jokes, knew the answers to all the riddles, and had long been immersed in the gestalt of the world Miller had created. I cannot say how a n00b would take the visual style, the extreme violence, the gallows-humor, or the bleak plots.<br/><br/>The thing to understand, if you are wavering about seeing this movie, is that the violence is NOT gratuitous. It is essential. Allow me to explain...<br/><br/>The stories of Sin City are all about REDEMPTION. <br/><br/>The protagonists are all ""bad"" people. Stained people. People who have made big mistakes, bad choices in horrid situations, people who were screwed at birth and getting by as best they can with what they have. Savages, fornicators, strippers, brawlers born in the wrong era, those who love too strongly and hate too deeply. People with little to lose but their last remaining shreds of integrity, people who stick by their friends because most of the world has ever been inimical to them. People who stand up for themselves, because NO ONE will stand up for them. People who do not flinch when the chips are down and hard nastiness is the order of the day. Such people as stop at nothing to do right by their small circle of friends.<br/><br/>The antagonists, on the other hand, are all EVIL. Very realistically evil: corrupt, venal, gluttonous, perverse as only civilized sophisticates can be... Those who delight in inflicting pain and death not as a means but as an end in itself. Those who seek to rule others, who are offended that anything exists without their permission, who spend others' lives like a rich man spends dollars. Those who hide their evil in plain sight - dressed in the gaudy robes of false piety and social standing. <br/><br/>The conflict between such groups as these cannot but be horrifically violent."
"Chromium_5","Null","3","4","7 April 2005"," There are better ways to spend your evening
","First of all, I have never read any of Frank Miller's stuff, but I knew exactly what I was going in for when I bought the ticket. I knew it was going to be gory and sadistic. My problem wasn't even with the violence (not that I liked it; if you are honestly ENTERTAINED by seeing a guy getting his limbs sawn off and eaten by a dog, you have problems, my friend). And for the record, there were parts I liked. Mickey Rourke's character was awesome beyond words, and each of the three main stories had its moments (the dominatrix women of Old Town, the Bruce Willis hanging scene, etc.). But for some reason, I just couldn't enjoy it. It felt like there was something missing. In fact, the whole thing seemed mediocre.<br/><br/>I guess the missing ingredient, now that I think about it, was Camp with a capital C. This type of relentless gore is usually done either to make you laugh or to make you throw up, but here it is apparently done to impress, and that just doesn't work. Seeing a guy's head still being alive after getting decapitated is very silly in a ""Re-Animator"" sort of way, but here it is done with a weird solemnity that I guess is supposed to shock or get a ""wow, cool"" reaction out of the audience. They should have played up the silliness factor (or just gone all out and turned it into full-blown exploitation, in which case I wouldn't have gone). There were touches of campiness, cheesiness, and silliness (especially in the badass narration), but NOT ENOUGH for a movie like this. It's just a lot of gritty violence that gets VERY repetitive after awhile (along with the visuals--yes, they're cool, but the blotches of color were making my head spin).<br/><br/>It's not over-the-top enough to be exploitation, it's not campy enough to be ""Evil Dead 2,"" it's not self-parodying enough to be ""Commando,"" and it's not even fun enough to be ""Kill Bill."" In the end, it doesn't go far enough in any direction to really be much of anything. It's really just two hours of sadism.<br/><br/>And finally, let me say the one thing that was on my mind the entire time: if Basin City is such a hellhole, how come it never occurs to the characters to just hop in a car and LEAVE? Why not go live in Iowa or someplace? If they're too stupid to leave the damn city, maybe they deserve the swords in the eyeballs."
"freemantle_uk","10","4","6","8 May 2008"," Frank Miller's work is done justice on the screen
","Sin City is a fantastic film, a must watch for all students and Frank Miller fans. Sin City is based on Frank Miller's graphic novels showing the violence and corrupt work of Basin City. Frank Miller is one of the best comic book writers around and he works closely the film industry. He wrote the script, co-directed the film with Robert Rodriguez and has a small role as a Catholic priest.<br/><br/>The film tells three different story: The Long Goodbye, The Big Fat Kill and That Yellow Bastard. The Hard Goodbye tells a story of revenge when Marv's (Mickey Rourke) love interest is murdered and he was unable to do anything about it. The Big Fat Kill is about the girls of Old Town kill a cop and with the help of Dwight (Clive Owen) try to get rid of the evidence because a gang war could break out. That Yellow Bastard is about a cop Harrigan (Bruce Willis) gets framed for the kidnap and rape of an 11-year-old girl called Nancy (Makenzie Vega/Jessica Alba) and the forces that did it set out to destroy what was left of the man.<br/><br/>The film is dark and stylist. The stories are engaging and very loyal to the graphic novels: if you pick up a copy of them you could match the panels to scenes of the film. It is willing to touch on nasty subjects and the use of black and white and colour work very well. The direction for the film was very good and Rodriguez has a nack for making entertaining films. Sin City also has a good cast. There are A-Listers such as Bruce Willis, Michael Madsen, Elijah Wood, Clive Owen, etc. Many performances were good, it was Micky Rourke's, Jessica Alba's and Brittany Murphy's best performances by far. I thought Clive Owen was good and at the time was one of the reason I thought he would have made a good James Bond. Elijah Wood offers a dark silence performance, trying to avoid getting typecast. The film also shown me Devon Aoki as a silence assassin and she is a very attractive woman. There was also good chemistry between many of the actors, such as Clive Owen and Rosario Dawson. Another good thing from the film was that it had some get film quotes all ready and waiting and had some great scenes. This is a common trait in Frank Miller's work, from the film 300, to his Batman graphic novels.<br/><br/>This is a good fun movie, but not advised if you don't like violence. I hope Frank Miller writes more Sin City novels and that the sequels are made soon."
"lemon_magic","7","4","6","20 August 2006"," Brilliantly designed, graphically superb,completely stupid
","The strength of ""Sin City"" is also its biggest weakness as a film, and that is the fact that the Sin City graphic novels are horrible.<br/><br/>Rodriguez and Miller pulled no punches here - every cuss word, every act of horrific violence, every sexual perversion and fetish, every hardboiled plot device that Miller put in the three ""Sin City"" graphic novels that form the backbone of the movie - it's all here, undisguised and uncompromising. In fact, that's the most impressive aspect of the film - I wasn't sure anyone could manage to bring ""Marv"" to life, or to duplicate the chiaroscuro silhouettes of many of the panels, or the hyper-violent choreography of the fights, or sound design that duplicated the onomatopoeia of the the comic form...much less make it convincing...but they do. The mind boggles at the creativity and inventiveness that must have gone into the design aspects of the film.<br/><br/>So: Plus several stars for the startlingly faithful and evocative away Rodriguez (and Miller) brought the look and feel of Miller's ""Sin City"" to the big screen. As an exercise in style, this baby is easily a ""10"".Maybe even an ""11"". <br/><br/>On the other hand, subtract several stars for the fact that Miller has been writing like a complete spaz-bag since ""Robocop 2"" (the movie) and ""Give Me Liberty"" (the graphic novel). In fact, he has gone so far over the edge that I don't think he will ever manage to write a good story - or a line of dialog that doesn't clink like a lead washer on the sidewalk - again. For that matter, he seems to have stopped actually drawing as well, since the human figures in his latest books are just jumbled blobs of shape, color and texture. (Sin City #7, ""To Hell And Back"" is his worst yet in that regard, and ""300"" is nearly unreadable.) And yes, I recognize these are deliberate choices Miller is making - I just think they are terrible choices. (Note that I'm not saying Miller himself is actually a bad person - he's just turning into a bad writer and artist). <br/><br/>Seriously, the ""Sin City"" stories read like endless variations and ripoffs of Dashiell Hammett's ""The Glass Key"" and ""Red Harvest"", only aimed at sexually frustrated 12 year olds obsessed with leather and death metal....but with less charm and wit. OK, I'll admit that ""Marv"" gets off a few really good one-liners in the first one. But otherwise it's like chugging Worchestershire sauce - what is fine in small quantities will make you gag served as an unaccompanied main course. <br/><br/>There are some talented and charismatic actors and actresses in here, and they all chew the scenery something fierce. I don't blame them - that's what is called for here, and everyone is appropriate to their role. Of the ""name"" actors, Benecio Del Toro is the hardest for me to watch, since I like the guy a lot and he's so broadly overacting that it's hard to believe this is the same amazing actor from ""Way Of The Gun"" and ""Traffic"". I am a big Fan of Clive Owen as well, but found him hard to take in his role as ""Dwight"" here. That's not really his fault...it's because I hated ""The Big Fat Kill"" story the most of the three graphic novels adapted here. (""A Dame To Kill For"" is at least funny in spots, and ""That Yellow Bastard"" is so revolting as to be actually fascinating. ""The Big Fat Kill"" is so stupid as to make no sense whatsoever.)<br/><br/>In summary: amazing looking movie, with a horrible, horrible script, but delivered with a lot of energy and conviction. The look and the conviction carry the day for me, but I can't rate it higher than a ""7"" because Miller needs to spend some time outside in the fresh air with a puppy and a kitten before he writes another graphic novel or screenplay. See it if you like Miller and you thought Robocop 2 was the ultimate movie. Or if you are (to quote Mike Nelson) a drunk, narcoleptic 8 year old. Or if you thought the trouble with Mickey Spillane's ""Mike Hammer"" books was that he just didn't go far enough."
"Superunknovvn","6","4","6","5 September 2005"," Intriguing visuals, but the stories are getting tedious after a while
","The big problem with ""Sin City"" is that it probably doesn't make for a good transition to film. Robert Rodriguez adapted the look of the comic book faithfully and the visuals are indeed pretty intriguing, but the different stories aren't particularly gripping. The monologes of the respective characters are getting tiring after a while and even the comical quality of the exaggerated violence in this movie doesn't make the whole experience any more exciting. There are some fine actors in this movie (great to see Rutgar Hauer coming back to a big budget production), but Rodriguez directs them all to act like cold, emotionless bricks. Maybe that's what he thought the comic demanded, maybe it's supposed to be super cool, but for me that kind of acting plus the neverending monologes just made the movie monotonous. While I did appreciate the original and affectionate approach and to a certain extend the ridiculous acts of violence, the movie left me indifferent and bored in the end. Still, Rodriguez made a much more honorable effort with ""Sin City"" than he did with ""Spy Kids"". It was about time."

","Sin city, I believe is one of the better movies all year and I haven't even seen a lot of them. With a lot of action and story, I believe that it is one of the better comic book movies you'll see...EVER! I'm impressed. Frank Miller, who is the creator, has actually helped produce the film. Unlike in Daredevil, witch I think wasn't good, Stan Lee didn't do a lot to help the film be better or even write the screenplay. He didn't write the screenplay for Spiderman either and that was good. The point is, is some comic books are a good idea to make a movie out of. Daredevil wasn't at all. Sin City, I thought wasn't at first, but after seeing it twice in the same day, It is one of the best movies I've seen in a good while. Since Pulp Fiction maybe. Pulp Fiction is better than Sin City, but Sin City is right up there with it."

Quite boring and pretentious stuff for the educated and mature mind. If you are one of the people that saw this and is wondering why you don't think it's great like everyone else, you're not alone.

That is all."
"joseph-posnanski","3","10","20","4 May 2005"," Overrated
","I was stunned by the reviews Sin City received. I was not bothered by the gore - I did think it lacked subtlety, though. The mistake was giving Miller such a presence - the man is a COMIC BOOK writer, not a novelist. He has no mind for character development or good dialogue - things that, you know, real writers are concerned with.<br/><br/>The easiest example is the scene where Michael Madsen shows up to talk Bruce Willis out of going after the pederast in the first scene after the dreadful Josh Hartnett voice over vignette. In three lines, Madsen ticks down that they've been partners thirty years, this is a mistake, blah blah blah... a complete lack of imagination went into the dialogue and voice overs in the film.<br/><br/>The voice overs are another problem, as there is a glut of them, and none of them do much to further our understanding of the story - honestly, they don't. Given that comic book conventions and clichés are known by virtually the entire movie going audience, I'm sure we could understand what's going on without the gravel-voiced, over-wrought inner workings of these anti-heroes.<br/><br/>Another problem was the non-concurrent story-lines. It worked in Pulp Fiction because Tarantino is a great writer and director with good awareness of what works and what doesn't, and because the story lines coincided at meaningful points. Here, the approach is scattershot, and perhaps one of the reasons it doesn't work is because Robert Rodriguez is an awful director. How could you possibly think Desperado and Once Upon a Time in Mexico are any good, if you've seen them? The sense I got from the characters is that Miller was smitten with his characters - he couldn't believe how cool they are! The most gratuitous scene was the one where Mickey Rourke visits his parole officer - partly because she saunters, topless, around a man apt to become a psychopath without his medication, and partly because ""she could get any man she wanted with that body of hers"" but won't, because she's a lesbian. That's a 17-year old writer's insight. I'm not talking about the line, I'm talking about the whole scene. It just seemed like a really cool thing for Rourke to say at that time. Whatever. Rodriguez has similar flourishes with his own characters, usually involving slow-motion scenes of pistols popping out of sleeves and bazooka guitar cases. Please."
"Teflon23","6","10","20","4 April 2005"," Kind of disappointing
","I went in to ""Sin City"" with high expectations, and came out a bit disappointed. With all of the hype I had been hearing, I suppose I expected something more.<br/><br/>The movie follows three overlapping stories of men seeking justice in the extremely corrupt city. Along the way they beat up and shoot a lot of people (it is an extremely violent movie, which didn't bother me, but it might bother some people).<br/><br/>I had a few problems with this film: First, I didn't really get how the three stories connected to each other, besides taking place in the same city. There were a few overlapping characters and locations, but they were pretty superficial. Second, the whole movie came off (at least to me) as a two hour exercise in hyper-masculine fantasy. In part this is due to the nearly constant violence in the film, but a lot of it has to do with the role of women. Nearly every female character in the movie is either a hooker or a stripper, and all of them are completely reliant on the male characters for everything - and seem to pay them back with sexual favors. The only women who had any type of independence were the hookers - seemingly sending the message that women only get power through sexuality. And even then, the hookers need one of the main male characters to save them. Third, the dialog seemed awkward in many places. I don't know if it was the way the actors delivered the lines or the way the comic book was adapted to the screen, but in a lot of places it didn't really work. It was supposed to be kind of like old-school film noir dialog, but a lot of it just came off as laughable. Finally (and this is really a minor complaint) there seemed to be an excessive amount of male crotch smashing. Once or twice is understandable, but there must have been at least 10 violent acts (punching, shooting, etc) directed at the male groin throughout the movie. There really wasn't any reason for them (except maybe in one case), and after a while it got kind of weird.<br/><br/>That being said, the movie was visually amazing. Some of the best and most unique cinematography I have ever seen. The music was pretty good too. As for the acting - Bruce Willis and Mickey Rourke were good, and Elijah Wood was downright freaky, but Clive Owen seemed stiff, and Rosario Dawson came of as downright ridiculous in parts. And the story (or stories, really) itself was interesting - I just think that something may not have transitioned properly from the book to the screen.<br/><br/>""Sin City"" wasn't bad, but I had some problems with it. I guess it just wasn't my type of movie.<br/><br/>Rating: 6 out of 10"
"VinceWatkins","Null","10","20","2 April 2005"," A microplating of dynamic visual style over a steaming heap of trash.
","I was very disappointed. All form. No function. The stories were simple and juvenile with simplistic themes to match and almost no subtext. The acting was insincere and did little to sell the story or the setting. The audience laughed and even groaned at the horrible performances. The storytelling was ponderous and boring, catering to an overblown sense of itself, like a stupid pathetic loser strutting and boasting in an attempt to convince itself otherwise.<br/><br/>But I see this as illustration that being a comic fan is like being a book fan or a film fan. Comics are a medium, not a story style or a genre. There are wonderful stories in comics and terrible ones. And there are some stories that work in the comic medium that will not work in cinema. I think that the only thing Watchmen and Sin City have in common is that they are not suited to cinema.<br/><br/>Sin City might have worked on the page. I don't know. I didn't read the graphic novels. But on screen, this story was shallow and clumsy, suitable only for children or the equally unsophisticated... but with too much sex and violence to make it appropriate for them. It would seem that the appropriate demographic would be mildly retarded teen-aged boys.<br/><br/>After two hours of boredom broken only by eye rolls, the only thing I was curious about was why the idiots that populated Sin City didn't simply walk out of it. As the credits rolled, I was glad to be doing just that."

"patrick_bateman_90029","10","10","20","23 March 2005"," Rodriguez, Miller, and Co. Triumph with ""Sin City""
","Before I begin my review, let me just say that I've recently become familiar with Sin City. After seeing the trailers and Comic-Con footage, I decided to buy the first five books to see what I was missing and what to expect.<br/><br/>Anyhow, I recently attended an advanced screening of Robert Rodriguez/Frank Miller's Sin City in Houston and hot damn, what a movie! The movie is based off three of graphic novelist/co-director Frank Miller's books and a short story from Booze, Broads, & Bullets: The Customer is Always Right  An assassin (Josh Hartnett) and his target (Marley Shelton) have a discussion on a rainy balcony that ends in bloodshed; The Hard Goodbye - Marv (Mickey Rourke), a hulking brute, is out to find the person who murdered Goldie (Jaime King), a kindly prostitute he met and fell in love with one night; The Big Fat Kill  Dwight (Clive Owen), an ex-photographer with a new face, is out to protect his two loves, barmaid Shellie (Brittany Murphy) and Old Town leader Gail (Rosario Dawson), from Jackie Boy (Benicio Del Toro), a rough hero cop who really doesn't know when to take no for an answer. And when his temper leads to his bloody murder, it's up to Dwight and the Old Town girls to get rid of the body before the cops and the mob find out about it and wage war on Old Town; and That Yellow Bastard  Hartigan (Bruce Willis) is the only clean cop in Sin City and out to get Roark Jr. (Nick Stahl), the pedophile son of the corrupt Senator Roark (Powers Boothe), who has kidnapped a young girl, Nancy (Mackenzie Vega as a child; Jessica Alba as an adult), and plans to rape and kill her. Hartigan rescues Nancy and puts Junior in a coma, but suffers the wrath of Senator Roark and gets blamed for Junior's crimes. Eight years later, Hartigan gets out and has to protect Nancy, now an exotic dancer, from the Yellow Bastard, a deformed yellow ""man"" that shares a disturbing tie with Roark Jr.<br/><br/>Before I discuss the film itself, let me discuss the cast.<br/><br/>Mickey Rourke is BACK with a vengeance. He owns the Marv role, just like Ron Perlman owned Hellboy last year. After years of bad cameos and roles, Bruce Willis finally gets it right with Hartigan. Clive Owen is great as Dwight (hell, he even gets the best monologues out of the three lead characters). Nick Stahl well, if you've seen Bully, you'll know what to expect, except that he's now a deformed pedophile instead of a violent surfer kid. Once you see Elijah Wood as Kevin, you will never look at him the same way again. That's all I can say without spoiling anything big. Benicio Del Toro is freaky as Jackie Boy and you honestly can't wait to see him get what's coming to him. Michael Madsen has an interesting extended cameo as Hartigan's semi-corrupt partner (the character also appears in A Dame to Kill For). There's also Michael Clarke Duncan, Josh Hartnett, Powers Boothe, and Rutger Hauer, but there's not really much to say about them except that they're effective in their brief roles. Jessica Alba proves once more that she's more than just a pretty face as Nancy. She could've easily played Nancy as some dumb bimbo who's in love with Hartigan (even though that would've been disrespectful to Miller's vision), but she brings vulnerability and sass to the role and it works. Chiaki Kuriyama, step down. The crown for Menacing Asian Warrior goes to Devon Aoki's deadly little Miho (and boy, is she deadly). The best thing about Miho, excluding her fighting abilities, is the mystery surrounding her. Like Uma Thurman and David Carradine in the first half of Kill Bill, you know nothing about Miho, except that she's silent and the deadliest woman in all of Sin City. For those worried about Brittany Murphy, don't worry (much). She makes cameo appearances in THG and TYB and plays a semi-pivotal role in TBFK (hey, at least it's not her repeating Little Black Book). After her embarrassing appearance in Alexander, Rosario Dawson makes up for it threefold as Gail. She's decked out in bondage gear and loving every minute of it. Jaime King is good as Goldie and her twin sister, Wendy. Alexis Bledel sheds her good girl image as Becky, the Old Town girl who brings chaos wherever she goes. And Carla Gugino has an interesting small role as Marv's lesbian parole officer who supplies him with his pills.<br/><br/>Now, onto the film Rodriguez KNOWS what he's doing. By bringing Miller on to supervise and Quentin Tarantino to direct one scene, he helps bring Sin City to life. The movie has an amazing 1940's film noir look to it, even with the sequences that had splashes of color, thanks to Rodriguez's cinematography and editing, which closely follows the images in the books. The art direction, completely CGI with minimal sets, is so realistic, you'd think they spent a fortune on it. The score, an action/jazz mix, is perfectly done by Rodriguez, John Debney, and Graeme Revell. While Sin City will likely be forgotten come Oscar time, mainly because of the insanely violent nature of it, I am hopeful that the film garners a Makeup nomination because the work done to create Marv and the Yellow Bastard is just phenomenal.<br/><br/>As I mentioned earlier, I bought the first five books and eagerly await the re-releases of Booze, Broads, and Bullets and Hell and Back just to see what Rodriguez and Miller are cooking up for Sin 2. If Rodriguez was right about wanting Maria Bello as Ava Lord in ADtKF and Johnny Depp for Wallace in H&B, then it could be even better than the first.<br/><br/>To keep it short and sweet: Sin City is THE movie of 2005. It's visually astonishing and has a great ensemble and director(s) to back it.<br/><br/>A+"

Because I'm extremely annoyed of having waisted 1 hour of my time !(I could not make it through the entire thing) And also because I'm extremely worried of the direction Cinema is taking...I remember a time when we valued:<br/><br/>-actors' craft (I mean, real actors like Laurence Olivier, John Gielgud, Alec Guinness, Max Von Sydow, Marcello Mastroianni, Bruno Ganz, and more recently people like Jeremy Irons, Geoffrey Rush, Robert De Niro etc...),<br/><br/>-directors' artistry (real directors like Ingmar Bergman, Francois Truffaud, David Lean, Cohen brothers, Theo Angelopoulos, Wim Wenders, Volker Schlondorff, Jean-Jacques Annaud, Luc Besson, Robert Benton, Roland Joffe, Terence Malick etc...)<br/><br/>-Screenwriters or great authors (from Charles Dickens and Jane Austen to Paul Auster, Virginia Woolf or Philip Roth...)<br/><br/>-cinematography (Nestor Almendros, Sven Nykvist...), soundtrack (ennio Morriconne, Rachel Portman, Erich Wolfgang Korngold, Nini Rota...)<br/><br/>But maybe all of that is not important, and maybe we can make movies without it: with terrible actors instead, terrible cinematography, terrible directors, terrible stories as long as we put sex and violence in it. And it will become a blockbuster (it is SO important to make money that we tend to forget about making art) and thousands of people will come on IMDb and give the ludicrous vote of 8 out of 10! (they must be kidding; I looked for 0 but the lowest is unfortunately 1! It's already way too much for that s...)<br/><br/>If you like cinema as an art, like theatre or classical music and painting, don't watch this. If you prefer entertainment blockbusters, if you hate Shakespeare, if you love techno, rap and other *beep*, if you prefer the painting on your wallpaper rather than any painting by Vermeer or by Monet, you will certainly love it!"

","I saw ""Sin City"" last week. It was technically very exciting and innovative and I really enjoyed that part of the movie. I had a problem with the gun violence though and I had a problem caring about the characters in the cast. I really wouldn't want to meet or know any of the people in the movie, except for biblically knowing some of the women. The women were in the movie just as sexual diversions and their acting, besides maybe Rosario Dawson, was pretty bad. Jessica Alba is stunning but she can't act. This was a perfectly prurient piece with no hint of redeeming social value. I know it was meant to emulate a comic book and I think it did do that job extremely well but I can't help think that there should be some small bit of social consciousness raising in our entertainments. Why are we so surprised when a teenager takes a backpack of guns to school and emulates what I saw in this movie. I don't mind violence in movies just as I don't mind sex in movies. I do mind gratuitous sex and violence and this movie was gratuitous in spades. If the sex was more graphic it surely would have gotten an X rating but would it have gotten one due to the violence. Could it get too violent to ever get an X rating? I think Hollywood has this love affair with guns. Many, many, many Hollywood movie plots are resolved with gun violence. Moral dilemmas are solved with guns. I recently saw ""The Hostage"" and it was about guns, guns, guns. I think guns are a substitute for decent writing. I find it distasteful."

","Those into graphic novels and comic-book mayhem are a ready-made audience for ""Sin City"", which may account for its incredibly high and generous rating. Target audiences for these kind of darkly comic bloodfests are so over-prepared to enjoy the movie they sometimes let the faults pass by unnoticed, or automatically forgiven. The narrative in ""Sin City"" is so shaky, and so undemanding, that the slugging, brawling, slicing violence doesn't mean much to us--there's no drive behind the plot to make us care. It's all mechanisms. Bruce Willis, as a Basin City cop with a bad ticker, tries saving a young girl from a Senator's son, a nasty, twisted child molester, but ends up shot full of holes and framed for the worm's crimes. In between his downfall and eventual release from prison, there are other stories of anti-heroes and scummy villains(the best of which features Mickey Rourke as a muscular but tender-hearted tank who is determined to find the guy who killed his lady). Yet, only Willis' portion of the picture has any soul. The production is immaculate, and the film is well-cast and shot, stylized with great skill and talent, but the sexual violence is nasty, and one is never quite sure whether to take the shootings and beatings and road rage even half-way seriously. One minute it's an R-rated cartoon, the next it's a byzantine play on old Bogart movies, with death as a reality, revenge and guilt and obsession as talismans. But, for a sadomasochistic mêlée, it certainly looks like nothing else, and that might hold attention for the non-graphic buffs."

","I'm not a big fan of the gangster film genre. Especially not this one. Some comic books were just meant to be comic books, and not transferred into film.

A lot of people go to see this movie and think they are cool and tough but the're really just ignorantly overwhelmed and intoxicated by the violence and whoring that consistently makes this a bad view that you can live without seeing. The acting is mediocre and nothing special, and the only thing I remember after the movie is not the acting, story, or even the ""black and white representation of a comic book"" style. The only thing I remember is an ugly pot-bellied rapist getting his reproductive organs ripped from his crotch and then getting his head literally smashed into a flattened pulp by Bruce Willis.

","""Sin City"" has just been released in the Brazilian movie theaters and, when a saw the IMDb Rating #93, I said to myself: ""- I will see ""Sin City"" in the theater"". However, some movie lover's friends of mine were very disappointed after watching it. When I read the review of ""Sin City"" of the Brazilian director and journalist Arnaldo Jabor (http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0413020/) on the newspaper, I definitely decided to rent the imported DVD and watch it with my family at home. We saw this movie yesterday, and we all did not like it. ""Sin City"" is visually impressive, with a magnificent black & white cinematography; the cast is a constellation; the opportunist, commercial and overrated director Robert Rodriguez indeed transposed a comic magazine to the screen using Tarantino's name and violence. However, the story has too much free violence and most of the characters are very nasty. I did not find ""Sin City"" a bad movie, but completely overrated. The spot of #93 is totally unfair and a complete disrespect with other films of the history of the cinema, some of them masterpieces of the worldwide cinema and not considered in IMDb Rating criteria due to the quantities of vote, as if quantity could mean quality. Further, I noted in the breakdown that most of this votes belong to young people, making me sad when I see how used to violence they are. My vote is seven.<br/><br/>Title (Brazil): ""Sin City"""

","Someone suggested that whether or not you like Robert Rodriguez' and Frank Miller's SIN CITY came down to whether or not your Liberal or Conservative. The Conservatives, he said, were more likely to love the film.<br/><br/>I didn't much care for SIN CITY but political d'ruthers are irrelevant with regard to it.<br/><br/>I'm as Liberal as any anti-crypto fascist zombie brigade-bashing elitist snob can be. I'll fight the neocon Death Cult so long as I have breath in my body and wiggle to my fingers. But that had nothing to do with my reaction to the FILM.<br/><br/>I wasn't offended, didn't find it degrading to women, didn't mind the violence; I enjoy graphic novels, love comics, hell, I even write stuff like this (take a peek at my story, ""Catching"" in the anthology, SEX CRIMES). My problem was -- and this was a beautifully realized, well acted comic book -- that it was a comic book.<br/><br/>Comics/graphic novels make their point viscerally, they do it  in and out  in 15 - 20 minutes; they allow you linger on image, to move back or forth in time, to jump and skip at your rate. Comics don't have to be real. They exist in that twilight state between the shadows of the imagination and the world in which we live and breathe.<br/><br/>SIN CITY is a well-made, beautifully realize, amusing 45 million buck comic book. It costs $9.50 and takes you two hours to get through. It gives you no more character development, no more story than a $2.50 book that you can hover over allows you.<br/><br/>Movies have to BE, exist in a one frame, one that moves, bends, adjusts moment by moment. At their best, films give you some character progressionsomeone leans something along the way. Movies, at their heart are about change. They enforce a linear progression: we sit down, they begin, two hours later, they end (well, LORD OF THE RINGS gave you a year's intermission between acts). Yes, Rodriguez flips and shuffles time in SIN CITY, but it's at his rate, dealer's choice.<br/><br/>Maybe this film would best be seen, not on the big screen, but on a well-indexed DVD, one that allows shuffle and shuttle, one that lets you freeze and dwell on image. But, in the theater, for a film fan...it's not worth the emotional hype its being given."

"Coventry","10","6","11","12 June 2005"," There's a new, exhilarating cinematic hell... It's called Sin City, baby!
","Finally...the very first true cinema masterpiece of the new Millennium is a fact! From start to finish, ""Sin City"" is a genuine mix of pitch-black poetry, horrific morbidity, classic film-noir atmosphere and groundbreaking new technologies. Frank Miller and Robert Rodriguez literally bring the grim comic world to life and it feels like you're in the middle of the fog-enshrouded streets of a nightmarish place where the smell of villain-blood and old whiskey nearly makes you dizzy. The screenplay for this first ""Sin City""-adventure revolves on three anti-heroes, all of them entangled in their own personal and blood-soaking Odyssey: a fatigue cop who desperately wants to finish a politically dangerous case before retiring, a gruesomely deformed creep who violently wishes to avenge the death of the only girl who ever treated him with some affection and a hero wearing red sneakers who guards over the neighborhood prostitutes. Along the way, a seemly endless series of ingenious but utterly deranged characters are introduced, all of them extremely lethal and as eccentric as you never seen them before! The events shown on screen are incredibly sadistic and provocative (glorified sleaze, sick massacres, perversity, obscure bars and even an authentic case of cannibalism!) but made irresistibly beautiful by the acting performances and Miller's unequaled talent for melancholia and depression.<br/><br/>So far, this also is the ONLY film that managed to convince me that working with new, expensive and digital effects doesn't automatically result in an overly fake and boisterous movie! The creative use of green screens provides the film with its unhinged film-noir touch, while the possibilities are left open for Rodriguez to experiment with color shades. The mini-explosions of color are far too intense to put into words: from the despicable yellowness of the mutated child molester to the unimaginably beautiful redness of the muse's dress. Even the slickest color-detail is praiseworthy, like for example Rutger Hauer's crystal-green eyes. I guess it's true after all: computerized visuals in cinema really can be a blessing...but it requires a gifted crew that wants to use it out of love for the story and not exclusively because it's easy and profitable.<br/><br/>""Sin City"" is a film of shocks and surprises. Most of the time, the shock and the surprises are subtly blend together! Who, for example, would think that popular but fragile idol-actors like Elijah Wood or Josh Hartnett could ever look so menacing? Or who ever thought that you could feel so much sympathy for an ugly misfit whose only joy in life is to kill and mutilate? To wrap it all up, ""Sin City"" is an experience that totally messes up every world-perspective you ever had. This almost feels like a cinematic orgasm: amazingly sexy, exciting and too cool for words. Nearly every actor or actress that is part of this production seems to play the part of his/her career. I can't possibly mention the brilliance of all the separate performances, because then the review would be overly long and you would have nothing to discover for yourself. Just prepare yourself to see a lot of perplexing acting (and pay special attention to Benicio Del Toro, Clive Owen and Jamie King!). My appreciation towards Robert Rodriguez is enormous. I already loved all his previous movies (except for the ""Spy Kids""-series, but I'm not in the target group of that, I suppose) but  after seeing this film  it almost looks like they all were just simple practice.... inferior and meaningless try-outs that slowly prepared him for his ultimate achievement in directing: Sin City! This production will probably never receive any proper praise or recognition from the so-called eminent critics or Academy Award juries but, really, who the hell cares?!? This is a cool film...a sexy film...a must-see film!"

Bruce Willis defies the bad/good actor tag for me, as i usually like him no matter what, even if the performance is poor...<br/><br/>the storyline begins promisingly, then fizzles into a sort of very poorly developed male fantasy... it's the usual unlikely scenario leading to a very young woman digging an old guy (quite a Hollywood staple, except for when they switch it round to having a hot 16 year old girl digging a 13 year old boy)... he resists her, there's some random violence using the ridiculous villain from the first part of the story, and the noble end... this one is the only sin city instalment to be split into two halves, the last part making up the end of the movie... skip the last half, it'll just ruin the memories of what came before...<br/><br/>the second story follows mickey Rourke (who i think is an underrated actor) as a hulking ex-con chasing the killer of a prostitute ""who gave him the night of his life""... by now the narration will be starting to annoy you... i appreciate a certain amount of cheesy dialogue is needed, but it just gets far too cheddary...<br/><br/>you'll also notice something halfway into this plot line... sin city has NO clever stories... it doesn't really have a story at all... lots of bursts of hyper violence, atmospheric shots of the face, cheesy dialogue, back to the hyper violence... i'm not really offended by violence (nothing in this movie seemed offensive because it was all so ridiculous) but i found the repeated gore to be dull and tedious... this movie has no substance whatsoever...<br/><br/>some of the things that happen in this part are just plain unbelievable... i know it's a comic book, but the scene of Marv getting hit by a car numerous times... well it's just dumb... then he gets knocked out by one blow with a sledgehammer... dumb again...<br/><br/>the actors try their best... they might has well cast a complete unknown for Elijah wood's part... could have saved some cash there...<br/><br/>anyway, this storyline was only a warm up for the crowningly bad moment in the movie... the big fat kill! be amazed at the blandness of Clive Owen...<br/><br/>be astonished at the worst line i've heard in a year, at the end... if you need a pointer, listen out for the word ""valkyri""... be dazzled by the pointlessness of the plot, coupled with its illogicality...<br/><br/>this is when it hits a new low... there's one good morsel when benicio's character Jackie boy starts talking after being killed (i think this scene was directed by Quentin Tarantino, who i'm sure had a hand in directing the warrior woman Japanese sword swinging babe scene too, even if he won't admit it)... it's a neat scene...<br/><br/>they could have quite easily left this one out and developed the other two a bit more... which brings up my point about the tie-in...<br/><br/>*SPOILER* the two psycho killers from the first and second stories BOTH USE THE SAME FARM TO KILL WOMEN... doesn't it get a bit crowded?... it seemed very unlikely to me... sorry i just had to mention that...<br/><br/>all in all, it's a seriously boring movie... it could have been 90 minutes, with more story, less gore, and the same great visuals... instead... it's just cruddy..."

","This movie is a violent revenge fantasy for adolescents. You've got hot babes, you've got lots of blood. If that fills the bill for you, have at it. If you enjoy watching movies whose characters resemble actual human beings, stay far, far away.<br/><br/>Since the enormously-influential ""The Dark Knight Returns"", Frank Miller (along with many other comic creators) seems to be in a race to the bottom to see how much filth and depravity he can throw into each story. Unfortunately, that's all he throws into each story. There isn't the slightest shred of human motivation, or characterization. Every single character is a bizarre caricature of extreme violence or perverse sex who bears not the slightest resemblance to any actual, live human being. I can only guess that this appeals to adolescent boys who imagine that they're watching an ""unflinching"" portrayal of the evils of the world (while they're really getting off on the hot babes who kick ass). For the rest of us, it comes off as an extreme parody that would be laughable if it didn't take itself so very seriously.<br/><br/>Too bad, too, since the visuals are quite impressive.

"eched","4","8","16","12 August 2005"," I know films have gone down over the years, but we still shouldn't settle for trash
","I know what you're thinking. Sin City, got to be a great movie. You've heard nothing but good things and the adds look stylish and cool.<br/><br/>Well, let me tell you, it's not the best there is. In fact you couldn't pay me to see it again. I 100% believe that the only reason why anyone is saying this is good is because they've seen some really bad new films, so this actually looks like the holy grail to them. Well, just because you got stuck seeing films like Cabin Fever and Diary of A Mad Black Women, doesn't mean you should praise a film for being slightly less painful.<br/><br/>Where to start, well this is a film of about three or four short stories. The first flaw is that each of the short stories doesn't really have a main plot. Each story starts out with a simple plot, but then half way threw it does a 180 and goes in a completely different direction. The film is really all over the place and can't make up it's mind where it wants to go. One story starts with a cat and mouse game between the hero and bad guy, then suddenly the bad guy is dead and the story is still going for some unknown reason, then the bad guy starts coming back from the dead, then that is all forgot about and a mob war suddenly brakes out over a head. No direction what so ever.<br/><br/>A few of the stories start to travel into Kill Bill territory. I.E. No plot, just senseless kill after senseless kill until you lose count. Now, some people liked Kill Bill because of this, but personally this annoys me. Senseless deaths start to put you to sleep if they become to constant and the film as a whole starts to turn into a broken record.<br/><br/>And I know this is based off of a comic, but did it have to be so much like a cartoon? It's so campy in this cartoon aspect that I thought it was meant to be a joke, but there's no actual joke in it. The guy is tossing cops like he's Superman but there's nothing to really redeem the scene by making this stupidity look funny. Now, not every film should be funny of course, but when a film becomes as campy as this one does it's kind of a given.<br/><br/>And to top all this off there is just nothing really enjoyable in this film. It's not an action because you need fight scenes to pull that off and this is nothing but death and bad plot points. It's not a drama because it's to cheesy for it. It's not a comedy because there is nothing really funny about it, and it ain't no horror. There is nothing here to actually enjoy, unless you like horrid and pointless love subplots that go no where. Hollywood sure has come to believe that we love rubbish like that.<br/><br/>4 out of 10. Like the characters of the film tell you to stay out of Sin City."

Perhaps it is even very true to the comic book, I haven't read it, so I can't say for sure. If it is true to the comic book, however, then this is one comic that I have no interest whatsoever in reading.<br/><br/>There is no real character development in this movie, unless you count a rising death toll as character development. And I found it impossible to care what any character was going through. The movie felt unbelievably long to me because I had no interest in any of the characters and therefore no interest whatsoever in the stories.<br/><br/>The overriding point of the film seemed to be death and oftentimes dismemberment. Not specifically for any reason, just for the sake of death and dismemberment. Some might argue that all of the killing was done for vengeance, but when you don't care about the characters you find it hard to accept so much killing for them.<br/><br/>I admit I'm not a fan of violence, but I've really liked many violent films, if that film uses violence to make a good point, like in ""Gangs of New York"", or if you care enough about the characters and their situation, like in ""Braveheart"". However, neither is the case in Sin City."

In other words, I wanted a Bogart movie, and what I got was a sicko movie. Tarantino and Rodriguez are, quite frankly, beginning to scare me.<br/><br/>I like violent stuff when it's well-done. Really, I do. ""Night of the Living Dead"" is a masterpiece. But that movie actually has proper characters and suspense and style. ""Sin City"" doesn't pause long enough to have suspense, a meaningful scene, or even a meaningful moment. The male protagonists are all interchangeable - grizzled guys with a penchant for helping fallen women - and the villains are all equally repulsive and dull. There are so many scenes of violent revenge-taking that the whole thing becomes tedious; I was never satisfied by the ""payoffs"" because I was never emotionally invested in the proceedings. The film is figuratively monotone, as well as literally.<br/><br/>And, needless to say, the treatment of women is repulsive.<br/><br/>Did I appreciate the style? Yeah, but it got old, like everything else. At the end of the day, this is nonsense. Come on - there's an evil guy who manages to regrow his penis, but it turns him yellow and rancid.

","What can I say about Frank Miller's, ""Sin City?"" This was the first time I ever went to a movie on a date and apologized to her for it. The hype, the ""film noir"" aspect, the ensemble, the directors, the Tarrantino guest spot, and the color scheme (black and white with a few primaries), made this look like something worth visiting. Then again, have you ever visited a relative when you were a child that had one redeeming artifact (Good cookies, Grannie's lemonade), but bored you to tears and had a horrible odor? <br/><br/>Without a doubt, every attempt at piecing together this adaptation of a graphic novel failed like putting a straw hat over a cannon. As a 21st century guy who likes sports, beer, and action movies, even this movie had too much graphic and unnecessary violence for me. One can only stand non-stop be-headings, castrations, and cannibalism for so long before they realize that their date fell asleep for a reason. Between the gore, there was bad dialog, no unpredictable plot development, and nothing to even throw you into saying, ""that was interesting."" It just came together poorly, and what looked like a good investment for a night out, turned out to be about as good of an investment in a Yugo. <br/><br/>I did say there were 3 things that I liked in this movie. 1.) Mickey Rourke was quite good in his role as the good-hearted torturing madman who fell in love with a hooker. 2) There was a funny scene with a skinhead thug and an arrow. 3.)

"Grim_Jack","3","8","16","1 April 2005"," Great comic book look spoiled by viciousness of ALL characters.
","First off, I'd like to say that I grew up reading Frank Miller Comics and graphic novels (Electra:Assassin, Wolverine, Dark Knight Returns, Daredevil, etc). Most of his protagonists had a dark side and an edge. Fine. But show me one character in this movie who has any redeeming qualities at all. The only one that possibly comes to mind is the Nancy Callahan character played by Jessica Alba and to a degree the character played by Bruce Willis. Everyone else is just unsympathetic. All the women in the movie are whores(most likely reflecting the Producers' opinion of women in general), some have hearts of gold, some are murderers who kill for pleasure. Senators' sons can rape and kill at will with no outcry from the public. One protagonist goes on a shopping trip to equip himself for sadistic torture and murder of a bad guy(a cannibalistic, murdering Christian). All of the Catholic clergy in Sin City are whore mongers, murderers and some are cannibals. Being a Protestant myself, I'm well aware of Catholic corruption, but this goes WAY TOO FAR! It is also amusing how the Weinsteins produced this Christianity-bashing movie, but they cried 'anti-Semitism' when the Passion of the Christ came out. They create anti-Semitism when they produce this crap, and such negative portrayals of the dominant religion in America. Religion can, and has been abused by people, but this movie isn't even trying to make a statement about that. The best morality this movie can come up with is Bruce Willis' character vocalizing that it is wrong for him to have any amorous relation with the little girl that he rescued who in now a 19 y.o. stripper(OK, not ALL women are whores in this movie). But heck, when she has grown up to be such a looker, who can find fault with him making out with someone the age of his granddaughter. There used to be a time when producers felt a social obligation and tried to uplift youth, or deal intelligently with their problems, but this movie caters to the worst instincts of teenage and young males with cheap thrills(gratuitous violence, half-naked women with guns, bad language, toilet humour) to make a buck. Great comic book look and style, but style goes only so far. Wait for it to come out on cable."

","The most striking aspect of Sin City, aside from its amazing cinematography, is that it's in the wrong medium entirely. Based on a series of graphic novels by Frank Miller, Sin City manages to be both provocative and ridiculous, and to achieve the former it requires that the viewer not only suspend disbelief but throw it out of the window of a moving car over a large body of water.<br/><br/>The movie is split into three stories that overlap each other slightly: ""The Hard Goodbye,"" ""The Big Fat Kill,"" and ""That Yellow Bastard."" All of them take place in a mythical hellhole called Basin City, whose appellation is, of course, shortened by all who reference it, given the death and sex and violence and other varied depravities that take place in it.<br/><br/>In the first story, Marv (Mickey Rourke) is an ugly, scarred thug who wakes up to find that the girl next to him in bed, Goldie (Jaime King) has been murdered during the night - and that the cops are on their way to get him for the crime. Marv doesn't go quietly, naturally, and vows not to rest until he's found Goldie's killer and avenged her. The second story is about an ex-photographer (Clive Owen) who - with the help of gun-totin', knife-wielding hookers - kills a cop and then has to cover up the crime. And the third story is about an honest-joe cop named Hartigan (Bruce Willis), who saves a little girl from molestation and death - but is himself framed for the crime.<br/><br/>If the movie had been presented in realistic animated form, it would have been such an easier sell. When I watch a cartoon, I know that the anvil landing on Wile E. Coyote's head isn't hurting the poor canine. But I do expect that most of the laws of physics should apply - if the coyote throws something into the air, it will indeed come down eventually. When I watch a live-action movie, I expect every one of the laws of physics to apply - or, at least when they don't quite follow those rules, my brain doesn't register it and instead focuses on the nifty special effects.<br/><br/>But this movie is kind of stuck in the middle. Marv runs *at* a speeding police car and jumps at it, his legs driving into the windshield. Okay, if that were a cartoon I wouldn't give it a second thought. If it were a live-action movie, I might - unless Marv were some supervillian bent on world domination and his ability to jump into windshields at 80 mph could thus be explained. But because he wasn't - he's just some giant schlub with a lot of scars - my brain immediately did a double take - ""Huh? Wha?"" Aside from logic, there's the dialog itself. In comic books - sorry, graphic novels - the dialog is *supposed* to be melodramatic, even stilted, especially when the story is set in a noirish age (think 1940s New York City). But in a live-action movie, this just plain doesn't work. Indeed, the dialog was completely unconvincing and insincere; it sounded more fitting for the back of a cereal box. Miller's dialog was childish and absurd; at no point did his words allow me to buy into the entire concept of a ""translated"" graphic novel. (Example: On two occasions someone utters, ""Yeesh!"" in reaction to some kinda bloody mess. Who in the world says ""Yeesh""? Honestly.) The very first scene - a meeting between Hartigan and his partner, Bob (Michael Madsen) was howlingly awful, and I initially thought the dialog was intentionally being exaggerated for (melo)dramatic effect. Then I quickly discovered that the entire movie was going to be like that, that this wasn't some sly commentary about how awful the dialog was in old-time mystery films.<br/><br/>Given that Robert Rodiguez co-directed (with Miller) and that Quentin Tarantino was listed as a ""guest director,"" I expected some wit, even if it were in the form of gallows humor. Sadly, none was to be found, and the movie was instead as soulless and empty as the denizens of Sin City itself. The bad guys weren't charming, the good guys weren't normal, and even the reverse wasn't true. No one was likable, which is a good thing in a purportedly gritty crime drama, but neither was anyone unlikeable; the fact is, I didn't care anything about the characters one way or another, and that's a serious misstep on the part of the screenwriter.<br/><br/>Far too long (124 minutes, but it felt like five hours), Sin City misfired for me on all cylinders. Booze, broads, and bullets (to take a phrase from the film) are all great, but even the explosions and gun-play - not to mention scads of scantily clad women holding said guns - couldn't overcome the vast pile of ineptitude in nearly all aspects of the movie, from casting to dialog to pacing to good IL' fashioned logic. Only saving grace is the excellent cinematography, but it's not enough to rescue an abysmal effort."

","This movie is the worst one I have seen in ages. Hailed as some kind of cult movie because done in black and white with the occasional red in some scenes, its content is outrageously and plain stupid. Its target group (hence the cartoon format) is certainly adolescent male adults. The lines are unintentionally comical because they seem like a compilation of all super-heroes' tough lines. Worst is the movie's unashamed sexism. All thinking beings (and unfortunately the protagonists are thinking out loud their brainless trash lines) are male. Females, who are mostly prostitutes (or ""merchandise"" as they are pseudo-critically called)or dancers who are not assumed to think while they are pleasing the oversexualised males. Moreover are they all in need of male help or protection throughout the film, which constitutes again a nice appeal to primal male urges. One woman, a lesbian, who, of course, appears naked in her first scene, is called a 'dike' by one of the protagonists, even though he cannot comprehend her sexual orientation because 'with that body she could get any guy"". In real life you would get punched in your face for such stupid statements. In this movie for some strange reason, and I suspect it is due to its 'arty' form, this gets elevated to a level of cult. <br/><br/>This movie is horrible stupefaction and should be watched more critically."

Every year or two an unconventional movie comes out and becomes the trendy movie of the year that everyone loves. It's as if latching on to this unconventional movie gives the average movie going public some indy-cred amongst their friends. The unfortunate irony is that they are just attaching themselves to something they found was pre-approved, but whatever. Being John Malkavich benefited from this, Lost In Translation (a movie I like actually) did as well as Napolean Dynamite and Sin City. Even if you find something positive or personally satisfying about any of the above movies it is hard to deny that the blanket worship by the mass movie-going public is suspect. Ask yourself, Is this really the kind of movie that makes 200 million dollars? Not typically, but here everyone is, regardless of personal tastes and film smarts, worshiping it. Is this really a movie that appeals to the masses or just an example of group-think? Being that the movie has silly dialogue, a slow pace and a middle 30 minutes that is just embarrassing in it's cheesiness I am inclined to think people are just desperate to fit in and not look stupid for ""not getting it""."

","""Sin City"" has great, breakthrough CGI green-screen visuals, some of the best ever committed to film. Those visuals are art-directed (read: borrowed) from many of the highly visual art styles seen in Japanese ""manga"" (comics), as were were Miller's original graphic stories. Even so, the film's visuals are striking--you won't soon forget the ""look"" of this film.<br/><br/>But ""Sin City"" is extremely gory throughout, with way over the top bloodletting and unpleasant, savagely violent and supposedly ""funny"" dialog/scenes--with lots of attractive T & A in tow. (A decidedly _non-erotic_ mix if you ask me, this blending of ultra violence, savage humor, and sexual imagery.) These juvenile obsessions are repeated over and over and make for a script that is pretty unbelievable, even in a film that purports to be in the style of Film Noir. In fact, the script _mocks_ the voice-over style of Film Noir and its clipped, cadenced dialog, piling it on and on to the point of absurdity and silliness.<br/><br/>So while I admire ""Sin City's"" stunning visuals, I was turned off by the level of psychic violence in the film, with its underlying glorification of--and exploitation of--extremely brutal violence, as portrayed in almost every grue-drenched scene of the film.<br/><br/>While talking about violent cinema, let me point out that ""Sin City"" sure ain't no ""Kill Bill, Vol. 1 & 2,"" films that are so much better and more artfully done--on all levels."
"franabanana","1","12","27","27 November 2005"," Nihilistic and grotesque
","I concede that Sin City is a visually interesting (some might say amazing) movie. The framing of the shots, the animation integrated with the movie, and the black-and-white with splashes of color are admirable cinematic efforts.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, these efforts are in the service of a story that is so devoid of art that the movie soon becomes tedious and disgusting. Many here have written of the graphic violence. Some may defend it by calling it ""cartoonish"" or ""stylized."" I call ""b.s."" The violence is nihilistic. It rejects all moral decisions and behaviors, and everyone is equally empty and ultimately inconsequential. The violent acts are non-stop and monstrous. <br/><br/>The dialogue and story give the actors nothing to work with, so even good actors such as Benecio del Toro and Clive Owen are as one-note and amateurish as the wooden Josh Hartnett (in a pointless walk-on role) and the barely there Alexis Bleidel. The non-stop hard- boiled narration is grating and superfluous, corny and eye-rolling.<br/><br/>Sin City is supposed to be a film noir. A true film noir shows you characters that are difficult to watch: think Treasure of the Sierra Madre, or Double Indemnity. Yet something in those characters make you understand why they do what they do. You can relate to them, as they show their humanity and weakness, the heart of darkness we all have inside. Those plots have mystery and intrigue, as you're drawn into a dark world and have no idea how the characters will get out. <br/><br/>Sin City is NOT a film noir. I'm not sure what it is, other than a very violent and simplistic comic book faithfully brought to the screen. That faithfulness to the comic book aesthetic shows up in the art direction, but also in the one dimensional characters; lame, slow-moving plots; pointless ""hard-boiled"" narration and dialogue; and extreme gratuitous violence."

","This movie is total crap. Sure -visually, it's stunning. But any movie can be stunning with a ton of money, and people who know how to do their job. Other than that, this is an over-the-top, too slick for its own good, wannabe film noir, but it misses the mark by a mile. Some of it was passable, for example the Mickey Rourke sequence I thought was well done, well acted, and the dialog was clever. But I felt that the acting by most of the woman character's was weak, almost sounded like line readings. Perhaps these women ( Gugino, Murphy,Alba, Dawson) are just nice to look at, and not much else. I have never fancied Rodriquez, he's a bit of a schmuck. His films are terrible, his writing is terrible, and he's an obnoxious creep, much like his pal Tarantino. I got an idea for a film, Tarantino & Rodriquez should hold a big love fest, where they do nothing but compliment each other, then at the very end, they blow each others brains out. I think that would be a great movie, and it would get rid of some waste in the business. Now if they'd only toss in Affleck, Damon, Edward Burns and Kevin Smith, I'd pay to see the sequel. If you have any taste in cinema, avoid this lame duck at all costs."
"DevLeeBee","1","13","30","31 March 2005"," Sin City is Sinfully Bad
","Sin City is Sinfully Bad (SPOILERS!!)<br/><br/>The much anticipated action film Sin City ranks high on our top ten list, right up there with the likes of Rollerball, which, by the way, is one of the worst movies we have ever seen. Despite an all-star cast, including many who have starred in blockbuster films, bad direction and bad writing has rendered these actors' talents useless. That is not to say that the acting was poor, it was just overshadowed by the distracting elements.<br/><br/>Perhaps in an attempt to recall back to old Hollywood classics, the film is done in a style resembling film noir with the major difference being that some colors do appear in the film, notably crimson, which makes far too many appearances in this extremely bloody and graphic tale. The purposeless gore and violence has unrealistic results that fail to suspend the audience's belief. For example, when a human sustains a full force sledgehammer blow to the head, it usually does not result in a small smattering of blood, it results in major skull trauma and death. If someone's limbs are cut off and his intestines are being eaten by a dog, he does not tend to live very long. It is hard to be pulled into the reality of the story when what is happening on the screen defies logic. Sadistic mutilation of the male genital area had both men and women in the audience groaning, and if you really think you want to see this movie, you may feel more secure if you wear a cup to the theater.<br/><br/>The film is based upon a series of comic books by Frank Miller and includes stories from several of the books. On their own, each story might be decent, but the filmmakers have failed to unite the three separate yarns into a fluid sequence. The plot is choppy and sometimes confusing, leaving the audience feeling as if they have skipped a cell in a comic strip. The story opens and closes on the story featuring Bruce Willis in his typecast role as a cop with a heart, but the two entirely separate stories that take place in between make it hard to reorient ourselves at the end. There are also some loose ends that are not explained. For example, Josh Hartnett plays an assassin credited only as The Man, and appears in the first and last scenes of the movie. However, it is never explained who he is working for and how the woman he kills at the beginning is. Perhaps these loose ends are explained in the graphic novels, but they are lost on the theater audience and make the film seem sloppy.<br/><br/>The many characters are well developed and well portrayed by an ensemble cast including many familiar faces from and big and small screen, but if you want to see these actors exhibit their skills, see a different movie, do not bother sitting through this one. We believe that most fans of Elijah Wood prefer to see him in a more wholesome role than a mute cannibal who lives alone on a farm with his dog and eats prostitutes. As admirers of both Bruce Willis and Jessica Alba we still find that there is something deeply wrong about seeing the two make out.<br/><br/>Yet there are some redeeming factors. Clive Owen's character Dwight wears awesome red Converse that match his vintage ride. There are some funny lines amidst the clichés and fluff. The noir-inspired style is completely unique and could be wonderful if applied to a better written and better directed film. But even in the comic book movie genre this film is really awful, making X-Men and The Hulk look like best picture nominees.<br/><br/>Copyright © 2005 by The Tamalpais News. All rights reserved.

"pyxysyzygy-1","2","9","19","2 April 2005"," commits the ultimate movie sin... it's boring.
","Basically, it's three stories (four if you count the bit before the title) crammed into one disjointed mess of a movie. The source materials are three comics mini-series: ""Sin City,"" ""The Big Fat Kill"" and ""That Yellow Bastard."" Sort of in that order. Sort of.<br/><br/>The movie starts out with an original short before the title, mainly just to set the mood, but also to introduce the Josh Hartnett character who reappears later. You can largely disregard it, because it's inconsequential to the overall movie. <br/><br/>The first sequence is the Bruce Willis segment, ""That Yellow Bastard."" Well, the first part of the Bruce Willis segment. It gets cut about a third of the way into it. So, we'll have to come back to it.<br/><br/>Next up is the Mickey Rourke segment, the original ""Sin City"" serial which ran in the comics anthology Dark Horse Presents. Bad prosthetics makeup on Marv (Rourke) conjures memories of the Dick Tracy movie. Other than giving a pre-glimpse of the killer, the story is taken whole cloth from the comic. Which is a bad thing, because the villains' motivations are still extremely vague. Exploring that some might have made this a more interesting story. Marv's infamous ""Is that all ya got, ya pansies?"" line was one of only two laughs in the movie (the other being the arrow guy in the Clive Owen segment). This segment has all the breasts (yep, that's all the tits you get). Watch for an appearance by Frank Miller himself as a priest.<br/><br/>Then comes the Clive Owen segment, ""The Big Fat Kill."" See, the problem with this part is that it's a sequel to a previous story entitled ""A Dame to Kill For."" Dwight McCarthy (Owen) makes a reference to having a ""new face,"" but that doesn't make any sense without the context of the previous story. Which isn't in this movie. It probably would've been best to just leave out this segment entirely, because it really has no bearing on the other two segments. The film's overall run time is too long, anyway, so this would have been a beneficial cut. Benicio Del Toro chews the CGI scenery, which is really the only redeeming quality this installment has. <br/><br/>***SPOILER*** <br/><br/>In the comic, the Alexis Bledel character (Becky) is killed in the prostitutes' ambush. Here she survives to show up again in the very final scene. Presumably meeting her fate at the hands of Josh Hartnett, who was paid by Rosario Dawson's character. A rather clumsy way of trying to make the middle segment fit, but apparently serves the traditional purpose of ""bookends"" on an anthology-type presentation.<br/><br/>***END SPOILER***<br/><br/>Then we get back to the Bruce Willis episode. What was his storyline again? After being pummelled for over an hour with the other two stories, it's hard to recall. Okay, yeah. I remember now. Anyway, there's some editing of the original script here (for example, Willis' character's wife never actually appears in the movie), for whatever reasons. Some details reveal that this *entire* segment occurred chronologically before the Mickey Rourke segment, not just the part that played prior to it in the movie. Probably very confusing for those who haven't read the comics! <br/><br/>There's another quick flash of the Elijah Wood character (this also happened in the comics), which doesn't make any sense other than to further establish that this event took place before the Marv section. Wood's character was a man of action and heightened awareness, and should have been involved in the final fight. But he wasn't. Oh, well.<br/><br/>***SPOILER***<br/><br/>Dangling threads: <br/><br/>The ""evil senator"" (portrayed by Powers Boothe rather than Chelcie Ross, which would have been a clever bit of stunt-casting) doesn't get a comeuppance. I can't remember right now if he ever did in the comics, but it would have been a more satisfying experience if this point were addressed in the movie. <br/><br/>Also, we still don't know whose finger that was in the envelope.<br/><br/>***END SPOILER***<br/><br/>So, in summary... <br/><br/>Bad makeup <br/><br/>Bad CGI <br/><br/>Bad acting all 'round, by people we've come to expect better from <br/><br/>Bad dialogue that was often even corny in a comic book <br/><br/>Plot and pacing lifted directly from the comics, not adapted at all to fit the needs of the different medium<br/><br/>I give this movie 2/10 stars. I'm so generous only because the main complaints about movie adaptations are so often how they aren't true to their source materials. Whereas this one is like ninety-five percent accurate. Unfortunately, this film is probably also the best reason *WHY* movie adaptations shouldn't be literally copied from their source materials."

The color visual effects were great for a difference in a black and white film. And the reason that I was not very impressed with the film was because the camera techniques were not that good. It was done so much same as other films out there today. I felt Robert Rodriguez didn't do anything special with camera techniques such as how Paul T.

So this is why I said there was nothing really special about Sin City except for that color visual effects.

Primarily modeled on three stories from Frank Miller's graphic novels, the film brings together so many elements which leaves the audience breathless... and wanting more. There's sex, violence, revenge, kindness and anger all shot BEAUTIFULLY by Robert Rodriquez following the rampant pace and dialogue of Miller's work. <br/><br/>When I first saw the cast list for this movie I was excited and worried; normally when this many stars are brought together the results are disappointing, but the most disappointing part of this film is having to leave this incredible world and these wonderful characters. It is so cliché to say it but it is as guilty a pleasure as watching a car wreck; the audience is so captivated by the gore and brutality and pure aesthetic perfection that it cannot walk away.

Every woman is a whore, sometimes a whore with guns, and they are all punching bags. Now, this statement could be passed over by people saying, ""Yeah, sure....but look at all of the OTHER violence that happened to EVERYONE ELSE in the film!"" Exactly my point.<br/><br/>I spent a good part of the film staring at the floor to avoid the gruesome and inhumane depictions of the human race at it's most horrific state. This world does not need to see that kind of violence.<br/><br/>At one point, when yet ANOTHER person had a bullet blasted through their skull, the guy behind me said, ""That's f**king awesome!"" Well, how ""f**king awesome"" would it be if that man with a bullet lodged in his brain were his father - or, bringing it to real life - one of the soldiers that we've lost in Iraq thus far.<br/><br/>I just don't understand how such gruesome and glorified violence is entertaining. It's one thing to have a wrench thrown at you to train for dodgeball and have that be funny, but watching a man graphically whip a woman he is about to rape and be told that THAT should be funny to me?

This movie is only about testing the audience's tolerance for violence as EVERY actor takes an over-the-top approach to EVERY shallow character. It's nothing more then an ultra-violent cartoon pretending to be something more. How many ""tough guy"" characters can we follow around killing in spurts of blood? I enjoyed the early sexuality of the film but by the fifteen minute mark it disappears and all that's left is cartoonishly twist crap.<br/><br/>The trailers and the TV commercials have showed EVERY frame of Jessica Alba's alleged striptease. Hard as it is to believe, there's NOTHING sexy about her character. The only redeeming factor about this waste of time was the extended nude scene of Carla Gugino who played Karen Sisco on the short lived TV show (I may have to check out Spy Kids 3 now!). Other then those two minutes, this movie was flat out awful.<br/><br/>If this illogical and cartoony thing is any reflection of the twisted things going on in Frank Miller's mind, then I'm glad he's out of the mainstream. Save your money."

","I saw this movie today thinking that it was going to be outstanding, based on other comments and the general hype. Let me just state for the record that I haven't read the comics. I understand that it would likely have been better if I was familiar with the comics, but that doesn't make me appreciate the MOVIE any more. I thought that the style was interesting at best. I didn't understand why the yellow character was so special that he got to be one of the only fully colored characters in the whole movie. The stories tied together so weak that I had to struggle to see how the whole movie was even important. The action sequences were fairly well done, I wasn't, however, blown away by any of them. The style made all of the action seem insignificant.<br/><br/>Basically, the style was meant for a strong story, but instead relied on average action, and the dialogue was forced and choppy. Unnecessary comic relief also snuck in from time to time, which didn't help. 2.5/4"
"FilmFlaneur","6","8","17","30 September 2005"," Sin City - sorry, guys...
","Just saw this for the first time and, oh boy I wanted to enjoy it. But while I appreciate that I am probably in a sulky minority of one, I'll admit to being a little disappointed. Praise has been heaped on the film by fans who see it as one of most successful realisations to date of comic book to big screen, and the stylisation was striking which one imagines is, alongside with the dialogue, Miller's chief contribution. But to this viewer it still seems a shallow film despite (or because of) these origins, another to add to the increasingly empty tally created by Rodriguez, even if not quite so annoying as the macho posturing of Once Upon a Time in Mexico - another film in which the director thinks showing 'cool' is the answer to all the requirements of an action narrative - or the self indulgent mess of Lava Girl, come to that. Aided by the author himself (and by Tarantino as well, apparently) Sin City has mostly the same tone throughout, either a gravelly-voice gravitas instituted by the principals or a continuous tone of humourless, hard boiled pastiche - fun in a short film maybe, but wearing after half an hour or so. When lighter-hearted moments did occur - such as when a henchman idly contemplates an arrow through his chest - it was much needed contrast. God help the viewer who opts for the 140 minute expanded edition coming in December.<br/><br/>This while the joining together of different stories, even if it cemented Miller's vision, wasn't exactly subtle either. Gone, certainly, is the narrative skill of Pulp Fiction and perhaps Tarantino could have been brought earlier at the script phase as the arch dialogue, while initially fun, is a million miles from the memorable banter between the thugs of Reservoir Dogs. But perhaps Miller thinks what fits in the speech balloons of a comic is good enough to carry things along on screen over a much longer stretch of time - sadly, it's not.<br/><br/>One doesn't have to be a feminist either to find the treatment of women less than enlightened: either conniving, weakling or, (as a token gesture perhaps) temporarily empowered by the plot only to have the masculinity of events take them over. The whores of Old Town may fire the guns down onto their enemies, but its the men who always do the significant talk and walk. (And wasn't that female-samurai sword killer a new stereotype, something we've seen already in Kill Bill?) The film makes up a sort of adolescent wet dream of 'cool' violence and mild S & M which shows the influence of Tarantino and crowd more than any particular imagination. I've nothing against screen violence, cool or not, but when most else is stripped out so that it becomes the raison d'etre of the narrative, leaving only style behind, it left this viewer at least feeling sorely cheated, and desperate for some variety. A good word here, though for Micky Rourke, who in Marv created the most memorable character and who elicited genuine sympathy; a bad word for Clive Owen who seemed miscast to me, as well as the variable female actresses who populated 'Old Town'. And what's with Bruce Willis' Hartigan? A tough guy who complains about being an old man, close to retirement, on one last case etc, only to be shot endlessly, all this before leaving prison '8 years later'... looking as spruce and as youthful as he went in (greeted by a similarly unchanged Michael Masden I may add)? Maybe I am getting too old, but I found it hard to finish the film, and ultimately I found it irresistible to imagine some of Sin City's most fervent adherents uncritically watching the show on offer with the same rapt, brain-dead expression as the prematurely de-limbed Kevin.."

I slept through this film which I found to be mindlessly violent and typical of the modern trend in film making where special effects substitute for a script. The acting, sadly, does not save a bad script. Yes, the visual appeal and style are unique. One can paint a great masterpiece when painting, but that alone will not make the work legendary if all you paint is a turd.<br/><br/>This is more of a comic book turned into a movie, and that too has been a trend in film-making. I am not sure that it is a good trend, but then audiences these days do not want or expect more from a story than a very simplistic plot line.

","""Sin City"" has great style, and the literal translation of graphic-novel to film is great. I'm fascinated with the blurring of the lines between comic/cartoon/live action/computer game, and visually this one makes it. The fault here is with the writing: too much sophomoric and wildly implausible dumbness. Quentin Tarantino avoids this in his own films: he makes his almost-cartoon characters work because he knows how to combine the surreal with the utterly commonplace. He does that with the story and he does it with the characters. Also, he knows when to be ironic, and when to play it straight. I saw little of this in ""Sin City"", despite Tarantino's involvement with it. The one good line in the movie has to be Tarantino, though, where Clive Owen describes what Devon Aoki does to Benicio del Toro. (You'll see why.) Some good performances: Benicio del Toro all the way over the top; Nick Stahl as a castrated proto-Ferengi child molester; Mickey Roarke (for real!) in way too much makeup but playing an Arnold Schwarzenegger character in the idiom of Mike Hammer - irrationally, it works. Powers Boothe and Rutger Hauer stole every scene they were in - wow. Lots of stunning but eminently forgettable women with seriously chapped butt-cracks. (You'll see why.) Bruce Willis was good, but his character is so implausible, even for a live-action cartoon character, that it doesn't work. Elijah Wood as Kevin and Devon Aoki as Miho needed to hook up--Miller et al missed an opportunity there. (You'll see why.)"

Some things, some images, some spoken dislodge, can only be realized in your mind. The best actors in the movie are Clive Owen, Benicio Del Toro, Elijah Wood and Rosario Dawson, but the rest of the movie is a disaster in tone - it's all over the place, like an atom bomb of boldness going off in a movie theatre. Boldness is OK when it works, but here the extreme, unrealistic visuals combine with the hammy and tough-to-deliver dislodge in a catastrophically bad movie.

","This film was terrible, painful to watch, offensive and oppressive. <br/><br/>It is filled with violence against its women characters, who are all either whores or victims or whores who are victims. Every story line involves a man saving or rescuing a woman or girl from another man. Women are shot, beaten, knocked to the ground, tortured, mounted on walls as trophy-heads, etc. While there are some women in the movie who kick ass, it is not enough to justify the rest of the film. (Besides, they're still women who kick ass as half-naked dominatrix-prostitutes who ultimately need the male narrator -- all the narrators are men by the way -- to take direction and save them anyway.) <br/><br/>In general the whole movie is crazy violent and disturbing, and coming from me (video game addicted, zombie-flick loving) that's a serious statement. People were actually walking out of the movie in a pretty steady stream by a certain point. My friends and I stuck it out to the end, but when we walked out of the theater we all were completely stunned by what we'd just been through. We literally felt violated and victimized and chose to take cabs home.<br/><br/>The performances were great. Visually it was stunning. There's no doubt the film evoked an intense film noir feel.

Maybe Rodriguez and Miller needed to insert that name to feel ""revitalized."" However, nothing in the film can be said to provide any insight into the human condition other than the sad reality that some people would like to think of the world as a nihilist dream where only the Nietzchean superman can score.

If someone wants to complain about violence in comic book creations, this would be a prime example.<br/><br/>Manipulation of black-and-white scenes with intense color highlights can only take a viewer so far.

The film is really not a feature length motion picture, instead it's three short films with a few common characters. The actions of the common characters do not effect the through line to each short story so it's really a cheat to bill as a feature what is essentially a collection of vignettes thrown together for length. One of the stories bookends the other two. One story involves a huge guy who is framed for killing his one true love. It's great. I wish they had expanded it into a feature picture. The protagonist was interesting and the story was compelling. The other two stories were all style and no substance. I was bored. I very nearly walked out of the theater, and seldom do I like a film so little. When I go to see a feature, I want to see a feature. A compelling story with a through-line told over about two hours. This was not that, and I think selling it as such is misleading. Skip Sin City you're not missing much, or rent it and watch the one worthwhile short film within it."

However, I think they may have lost something in the transition from page to screen.<br/><br/>The story, or rather stories, in the movie are not bad, but nothing particularly groundbreaking.<br/><br/>Hardigan's 'out for justice at all costs' storyline (That Yellow Bastard) is probably the best, in my opinion. Willis also turns in the best performance in the movie. Madsen, on the other hand, has the worst lines, both in this movie, and his entire career. Jessica Alba is cute, but I think she looks better in the Fantastic Four previews. Nick Stahl is uniformly if generically evil.<br/><br/>Mickey Rourke as Marv was a good choice, and I think Rourke is a good actor, but the lines he was given... ouch. His dialogue was clichéd and unbelievable. It looks good on paper, but spoken, it just sounds kind of stupid. As for the storyline, its pretty formulaic revenge fare, the highlight being the villain, Frodo Baggins as a razor-clawed-ninja-charlie-brown-harry-potter-cannibal (don't ask).<br/><br/>The final segment was my favorite, with Rosario Dawson and Clive Owen. But it had the worst line in the film. (RENEWED SPOILER WARNING) The ""I thought she told me to stop, what she was saying was 'COP'"" I wanted to shove knitting needles through my eardrums. I found this was a recurring problem throughout the film.<br/><br/>Having not read the comics, I don't know, maybe this is explained there, but I was left with several questions, such as: Why is Marv almost superhuman? Why can Dwight jump off a building ledge, land on his feet, and survive? I thought Sin City was not a superhero-type book. What did Shelly mean by Dwight's ""new face""? Who the heck is ""The Salesman""? Just a hired gun that specializes in seducing and killing women? Oh, and how do all those coats just happen to fit the gargantuan Marv? All that being said, I have to say I really liked Bruce Willis in this film. Of course, he had the best lines (""There's wrong, then there's wrong, then there's _this_"" ""When it comes to consoling 19-year-old girls, I'm about as useful as a palsy patient performing brain surgery with a pipe wrench."") but had some of the worst (talking to himself, calling himself 'old man', giving himself a pep talk while hanging from his neck). Also, the two thugs that Willis beats down (twice) are very watchable. I would actually watch the film again for these two.<br/><br/>I didn't love this movie, and I didn't hate it. I'm glad I didn't have to pay to see it. There seems to be some serious passion surrounding this film. I've seen numerous comments about ""Best film of the year"" and ""Worst film of the year."" Depends on who you are, I guess.<br/><br/>The violence and misogyny so berated by many reviewers did not seem so prevalent to me. Maybe because I wasn't watching the film looking for such 'flaws.' Yes, the movie was bloody, but it was either a.) inconsequential, b.) conducive to the story, or c.) comical, like kill-bill injuries. Yes, just about every woman in the film was scantily clad or nude, and either a prostitute or a stripper. But on the flip side of that, just about every man in the film was a psychopath, sexual predator, overtly violent, or a corrupt businessman, politician, or clergyman. The film is not misogynistic so much as misanthropic. Only a few people in Sin City have any redeeming moral values.<br/><br/>I give it 5 out of 10.

If you have the maturity of a twelve year-old, then you will love the glorified violence, and over- the-top gore. However, if you're looking for any substance, you will be sorely disappointed. <br/><br/>At first the filming style is somewhat amusing to watch, the very first scene in the film shows a hit man seducing a beautiful girl, and then shooting her. The colors in contrast to the monotones, and the striking CGI backgrounds are awe-inspiring for about five minutes, but once you've gotten past all of that you realize that you feel nothing for the characters on screen, you have gained no uplifting (or depressing) insight, and you would have been better off spending your five minutes clipping your toe-nails. The rest of the movie is even worse. <br/><br/>The over-the-top violence, which could have been disturbing, is anything but stimulating. Seeing the soulless serial killer of the story (whose one-sided character has more depth than any other's) have his arms and legs sawed off, and then fed to a wolf didn't even make me twitch. And it's far from an aestheticization of violence, after watching the film I'm just about as exited about ripping off someone's testicles as I am watching paint dry. <br/><br/>Rather than add any resemblance of depth to the two-hour film, the story is split up into three sections, only one of which is worth sitting through, for Bruce Willis's performance (which is decent despite the film). Though I don't see how anyone could find the film exciting, the only reason to see it is if you have a violence fetish.

I found it to be the perfect balance between style and substance. However, I did not like his 'Kill Bill' movies as much. Part 1 - too much violence/style and not enough story. Part 2 - too much plot and exposition. With tighter editing he should have turned it into the one film it was meant to be. After all, 'Pulp Fiction' was originally about 550 pages long before he pretty much cut it in half. I blame the Weinsteins ....<br/><br/>'Sin City' is just so over-the-top in its blood, guts and gore. An alternative title for the film could be '101 Gratuitous Maimings for Dummies.' The other problem with the film is that it tries so hard to be slick that it is just cheesy. All the hookers in Old Town looked like Models from Lingerie catalogues. Not hot at all because its just so flashy and overstated.<br/><br/>The responses to the above complaints will likely be - ""it is not meant to be real, its meant to be cheesy and over-the-top, it's meant to be fantasy, it was made for a specific audience and they loved it, what were you expecting? "" Well just because they meant for it to be like this, it doesn't mean it is enjoyable. Just because they went for corn and cheese does not mean it tastes good. Just because its fantasy doesn't mean it should sacrifice all probability for bullshit. Just because this was made for testosterone-fuelled-youngsters doesn't mean its not a disappointment that the people behind this film are capable of a lot more. I hope 'Grindhouse' is more fun than blood and guts. If not, one day Tarantino's substance and nuance will rise from the ashes.<br/><br/>Final point. So why not a 1-star?

As near as I could make out the plot is just about revenge, over and over and over, which would make it attractive to adolescents, but the script is so bad, and the plot so badly delineated, that it can only qualify as a farce. However, the farce is hampered by poor directing, which makes it look only serious. It tries to get by on block looks and the one moderately funny scene where a guy is being dragged by a car; and looks like a drawing.

","It is true: Sin City is the most faithful adaptation of a comic or graphic novel to date. And yet, and yet Back in the old days, about a decade ago, comic-book movies were not respectable, Joel Schumacher hammering the last nails in the coffin. And then the renaissance: Unbreakable (not an adaptation, unless you count the steal from Grant Morrison's Doom Patrol), the Spider-Man movies, and Hulk (most people thought that fell badly between two stools  too artsy for the explosions crowd, too explosive for the artsy crowd  but I love it). These were movies giving us what we loved about comics. And now here comes Sin City, essentially Frank Miller's work converted directly from page to screen. Which is the movie's biggest problem. In their heroic efforts to stay faithful to the source material, Miller and Rodriguez seem to have missed a rather banal truism: movies are not comic books. What worked so well on paper does not necessarily succeed on film (or computer, as the case may be). On paper, the whole thing is literally two-dimensional, and the stylisation is pretty much the raison d'etre. But when you actually get real people (well, actors, at any rate) saying the lines and doing the things the characters do, this brings a whole new level of meaning to light. The graphic novels could get away with the violence and the stock situations (clichés, if you like) and the intense misanthropy because they were firmly rooted in a particular kind of pulp fiction. But if you start looking at Sin City the movie in the context not of comic books but of other movies, what were once virtues now look horribly like flaws. In a movie with so many characters, and fine actors, it's a shame that only two of them (Marv and Hartigan) are anything other than cardboard cutouts  and in both those cases, the depth of character comes more from their thoughts rather than their actions. Both of these stories involve violent revenge and the search for redemption through the love of a beautiful blonde. The middle story involves ah, I got bored at this point gun-toting prostitutes feminism's not my strong point but alarm bells were ringing at the idea of women who seem fully in control of their own lives and yet choose to be sleazy hookers which gets me thinking about Nancy  was there any particular reason, plot-wise I mean, that she had to be a table-dancer and not, say, a law student? You can get away with these things in comics but in the cold light of cinema it all starts to seem a bit adolescent. As for the male characters, there is, intriguingly, rather a lot of crotch-related violence. Oh the violence. Again, a still image of violence is one thing, but on screen it careers between too-real and too-cartoony. ""I didn't scream, Hartigan"", breathes Nancy after getting a sound whipping from a psycho. Good for you, love, they could have done with you back in Billy Budd's time.<br/><br/>Which is not to say I hated the film. I did quite like most of it. I haven't addressed the technical aspects here, because I think it goes without saying that Sin City is technically brilliant. There is a time and place for style over substance, though, and while I hate to admit it, I think possibly that at 34 I'm getting too old for this sh*t."

","What was up with the stupid narration. There was absolutely no reason for it and it basically killed the movie. I could see how it tried to be like a comic book with all the insight, BUT IT'S A MOVIE!!! And if they actually do the narration, they might as well not act, it feels like listening to the radio, or a movie for a def guy. Movies such as ""Goodfellas"" and ""Fight Club"" both have amazing narration because it gave some sort of insight. The part that was most bothersome was when Bruce Willis was narrating. He's a decent respected actor but when he narrates, it takes away from the performance. The occaisonal narration could be pretty funny like when the guy in the first third of the film talks about how with Carla Gugina's body, she could have any man she wants. Why did he put the narration in, someone please inform me. WHY!?!?!?!??!"

","Crowds are strange and odd things. They love and adore, hate and repel in equal measure and often without little thought. Nothing could be more applicable for the praise that has been heaped upon this seemingly 'epic', 'brilliant' and 'masterful' film.<br/><br/>This is simply a shallow movie that has been dressed up by directors, fans and critics alike to be a great critique of humanity, modern society and amorality. A complete contradiction is what I would ideally see as a kind translation of the truth.<br/><br/>There is no point to this film. The violence is repetitive and eventually banal, the acting decent and appalling in equal measure, the characters (oddly enough) so badly formed and unoriginal.<br/><br/>But wait, say my inevitable army of detractors, this is a great saga of good vs evil, of humanity vs evil, this is a great display of acting, cinematography of immensely talent and above all original film-making. Well I say, no no NO NO. The supposed 'goodguys' are just thugs with no compassion or mercy; what this film is basically a great advertisement for misanthropicism - no great case study of people struggling to fight their morals. All Rourke, Willis are fighting for is to 'look' cool and glamorise violence - its just so prosaic and deficient in any depth whatsoever.<br/><br/>All this film wants to achieve is that teenage boys will gawp at Jessica Alba's body, cheer at Mickey Rourke's gruesome atrocities and revel in the constant and unrelenting bloodbath. All this film is good for is some interesting camera shots and use of colour. Otherwise it is one immensely powerful deterrent to disregard any critic who labels this movie anything near decent.<br/><br/>This is one stupid and unintelligent movie, and anyone who thinks it is anything resembling a masterpiece is as bereft of logic and depth as this film."

","What a complete and utter bore of a movie. I cannot believe that the fan boys/girls are so entrenched in the idolatry of the graphic novels that they cannot admit that this movie is a mess. It is completely disjointed. What works in a graphic novel does not work on film. I have read all of the graphic novels of Sin City and found that my imagination went along way in making them work. What was put on screen was tiring and tired. How many stories of a man seeking revenge of the scorn of a woman can one watch? This was one retread after another and made the film way too long. How many toilet bowl dunking scenes does a film need to show its lack of creativity. I admit the film looks really neat, but gloss does not equal substance and this film has zero depth. This movie is rife with horrible dialogue. ""I tied those ropes myself it's my specialty."" Cheeeeeeeeese!!! What the hell was with the woman in the zorro costume? I know it is in the books, but she looked so utterly silly. Every time she showed up on screen the theater lost it. This is going down as one of the biggest disappointments I've seen on screen. This is a movie without heart and is so loyal it trips all over its own self. Lastly, for a film drenched in gratuitous sex and violence I find it highly amusing that the star attraction at the local ""strip"" club is a girl doing rope tricks. That is quite possibly the lamest choice of directing I've ever seen. If the actress doesn't want to get naked for the stripper role get another actress. I don't care how hot Jessica Alba is, that is lame."

Why make a slavish photocopy of the books when the film makers had an opportunity to translate this material into something that truly lived in the cinematic genre? And also, in this day and age, why hew to the stereotype of women so simultaneously nasty and beautiful that they have to be degraded and/or killed?

Marv's story was just about to start, so far i was not impressed nor disappointed. for some reason it just didn't feel right, i couldn't put my finger on it. this doesn't have to do with the petty stuff (ie Marv's head being bigger than his torso and it looked like he's going to fall over). this bothered me for the rest of the movie. reflecting on the movie i realized it was the pacing. none of the from the novels, in my opinion, where kept. it seemed as if it had a constant beat and every once and a while kicked it up a notch.<br/><br/>another odd part was the movement of the characters, it seemed as if they thought they where superheros. these are just normal people in an insane condition, no powers. the exception to this is Kevin he was the only character who's movements where as portrayed in the book.<br/><br/>the part of the movie i enjoyed was the jail scene, every thing moved just as the book did and i enjoyed it. as for the rest of the movie it wasn't anything special other than the way it was shot, it wasn't really a noir it was just careful with colors."

","Well after all the hype surrounding it, I expected something far better. How can stars of the likes of Bruce Willis, Mickey Rourke and Rutger Hauer participate in this crazy venture? The movie begins with a scene that has absolutely no connection to the rest of the movie. The use of black and white and a narrative feel is good, and probably the only point to be appreciated about the movie. The outlandish fight scenes with limbs flying all over the place are almost laughable. In fact, most of the audience where I viewed it on its first day of release was either shell-shocked or laughing. The character of Marv (Rourke) could have been explored further - we know nothing about his background before he embarks on his crazy revenge romp. Shellie (Britanny Murphy) also kind of disappeared into the background. Altogether a media-hyped movie that reveals Hollywood's lack of good stories."

Now I will say I have never read the graphic novel or whatever, but the premise sounded really cool and considering nothing has come out worth anything recently, I was looking forward to checking this out. I was pretty let down.<br/><br/>The film tried too hard to be in the same style as ""Pulp Fiction"" - an opening part...a few stories about different people that overlap each other...and then and end scene that kind of goes back to the first. The problem was, In Pulp Fiction everything somewhat revolved around Marcellus Wallace...in this one there really wasn't anything of substance to tie everything together outside of the location. The segment with Micky Rourke was by far my favorite and could have been a movie unto itself...but the rest just seemed too thrown together.<br/><br/>Maybe I'm missing something since I never read what it was all based on...but at the same time I never thought that should be any kind of pre-requisite to enjoy a movie. I wouldn't waste my time at the theater, just wait until it comes out on video if you have to see it.<br/><br/>I just have this feeling this movie will be one of those that people rave about ""just because"", and if you didn't like then you just ""didn't get it"" if you know what I mean."

A fan of film noir, I just loved the photography in here, although a bunch of it was computer-generated, or had that look. Nonetheless, it was fascinating to view.<br/><br/>The story, however, is so ugly and so anti-God and particularly anti-Catholic (and I'm not Catholic) that it's disgusting. Imagine a movie this prejudiced against Jews, Muslims, Buddhists, etc. But - give scumbag filmmakers a cross to make fun of (or a bunch of the nastiest women alive all wearing big crosses around their necks) and/or a story where the clergy are the worst villains in the movie, as we have here - and, oh boy, they're more than happy to make a movie with that as a main part of the story.<br/><br/>I have no problem with violence on film, but this is so overdone it is absurd.

The only reasons I gave this movie any stars at all was for: (1) The Jessica Alba boobie dance scenes  worth one star, and (2) The psycho Harry Potter scenes  worth the other star. Jessica Alba's boobie scenes are the movie's only saving graces.<br/><br/>What was bad about the movie? It was cheesy. The cinematography was cheesy. The dialog was cheesy  yes, yes, I know that it's supposed to be cheesy because it's an ""homage"" to pulp/comic books. To those who think that, I submit to you that there are two kinds of cheesy. One type is an entertaining type of cheesy (good), and a really cheesy type of cheesy (bad). This movie is the latter. Quentin Tarantino's whole cheeseball, pulp, violence-ridden, time-shifting ""style"" has moved from being innovative in Pulp Fiction, to being a novelty in Kill Bill, to being a cheap gimmick in Sin City. Enough is enough, I say. Think of something new, Q-boy.<br/><br/>Also, the movie is littered with cheap potshots at the Catholic Church. It's almost near the point where one could accuse it of being anti-Catholic. A lot of the anti-Catholic imagery and innuendos are really insensitive, inflammatory, and considering the Pope's passing yesterday, utterly tasteless. From pulling the trigger of a gun pointed at the head of a statue of a cardinal who surprisingly looks like the Pope, to the allusions of immorality and pedophilia in the next scene, this movie is full of these anti-Catholic images. The filmmakers would probably defend sprinkling the anti-Catholic imagery throughout the movie as a juxtaposition between the Church and the movie's namesake subject matter. But I see what's going on in the movie, and it's borderline Liberal Christian activism married to atheism. I consider myself a Liberal and enjoy movies which provoke thought, but this movie instead cheaply promotes negative feelings and reinforces negative stereotypes towards the Catholic Church. It's like the anti-Catholic version of blackface.<br/><br/>Don't bother watching this movie.

","Don't be fooled by all of the supposedly good reviews... That's the movie studio pimping it out, shelling out the big bucks to pay people to fill online message boards, and paying off movie critics to write good reviews. Otherwise, there's no justification for straight A's on Yahoo user reviews.<br/><br/>I'm a relatively liberal guy; I like horrors, and I am not squeamish when it comes to violence in the movies. But this movie was in an entirely new category of movies, one in which the directors should be ordered to undergo counseling for the public's safety. This is probably the closest thing to a snuff film marketed for mass audience. ""Sin City"" gives me reason to wonder if movies do help inspire Columbine-like massacres. There's a basic, predictable plot-line to the movie. 1) Woman is abused. 2) Man takes justice into his own hands. 3) Man chases down everyone involved, killing everything in his path. 4) Man murders, in cold blood, everyone even slightly involved. 5) Man tortures and removes family jewels of ""bad guy."" 6) Man beheads, dismembers, feeds to dog, etc. bad guy. 7) Man kills himself. (Sound familiar?)<br/><br/>In fact, at the end, I said ""let me guess, he (the protagonist) is going to shoot himself."" And he did, for no good reason...it was just predictable. The point? Squeeze as much violence into the movie as possible. In other words, violence purely for the sake of it. Not because it would add any dramatic element to the movie... <br/><br/>In fact, the psychological disconnect is what bothers me, it makes me wonder if this movie might actually help to brainwash people into thinking that violence (i.e. beating women) is alright. I don't mean to sound preachy; in fact, I'm not that kind of guy. <br/><br/>The movie glamorizes violence as the way to resolve problems. Images of clean-shaved soldiers at Abu Ghraib, or a man shooting an unarmed enemy combatant, come to mind...are we becoming a society that thinks it's OK to shoot first, and ask questions later? Don't we have any shred of decency that values human life? After seeing people walk out of the movie theater early (I, myself, would have left except that I was the driver for my group of friends), I was relieved to know that I was not the only one asking these kinds of questions. <br/><br/>I'm not advocating censorship; I do, however, believe in boycotting, etc. I regretted not asking for my money back, not because I couldn't sit through the movie, but because I know it's going to fill the pockets of some warp, sick, twisted, perverted, sexist, misogynists and encourage them to make more movies like this one. It's just pure, unadulterated junk, junk, junk, junk, junk!<br/><br/>I've been told it's a comic book story, that's how comic books are. I suppose I just don't ""Get It."" Sure, and what about Batman, Spiderman, and X-Men, none of which were really awful movies, like ""Sin City""?<br/><br/>And another reason why I think this movie is for teenage boys, is because of how it portrays women. In fact, it was almost like a Harlequinn Romance novel/""chick flick"" for males.<br/><br/>Look at all the terribly offensive stereotypes: Men with wife-beaters, leather jackets, cigarettes, beating their girls, and taking justice into their own hands. Women with skin-tight leather outfits, breasts exposed, smoking cigarettes, all beaten-up, helpless, and needing to be saved. Even the hardcore-prostitute gang ends up needing to be rescued by a man in the end... <br/><br/>Furthermore, the movie suffers from (in psycho-babble terms) a virgin-whore complex; meaning, if a woman isn't a virgin, then she's a whore. In the movie, if she isn't a prostitute yet, by the end of the movie she's at least become a stripper, while the guys are portrayed as all high-moral and good. <br/><br/>How many shots lingering on a woman's butt or breast before we get the impression the directors are objectifying women? I'm a man, and yet I was still offended! The whole thing is just so dang sexist, it makes me wonder how much society has progressed in the past thirty years.<br/><br/>The poor girls that I went with were traumatized, to say the least. They went home and watched Rudolph the Rednose Reindeer, because it was the most wholesome thing they could find in their apartment. It's too bad I couldn't erase the memories of last night. If you're going to see this movie, any way, stop by a Chinese restaurant first. Then, when you're leaving, take some chop sticks. That way, you'll be prepared when you want to poke your eyes out."

It's just perverted reality where cheesy characters you don't care about slaughter each other. That's all this ""movie"" is. Giving it any more credit then that just isn't warranted.<br/><br/>These Sin City fanatics are delusional. Sin City is nothing more then a violent video game movie. Add black and white, bare breasts, decapitations and blood to Van Helsing and what you have is Sin City.<br/><br/>The only award Sin City personal should qualify for is the Razzie. I haven't seen a movie this dumb or this bad since Catwoman."

","This was a very irritating film. It was full of stereotyped macho men running around trying to help the equally stereotyped damsels in distress. Every female character in this film was without exception treated as a sexual object, and usually as a prostitute who needed a man to protect her. This is a good film for those who have no sense of reality and are ignorant enough to think that the world either is or should be about strong, powerful men protecting weak, sexualised women. Those who love the fantasies presented by comic books, who believe that people are good or bad, and who like the idea that morality is as simple as black and white, will want to watch this movie again and again. For those who are grown up and appreciate films which are more realistic and not so ignorantly simplistic, my advice is to avoid this film at all costs, because it offers nothing to the intelligent, rational-minded adult viewer."

","John Carpenter must have taken lessons from Frank Miller. Gory-er sex; bloody mess; torture, perpetual killings, decapitation and castration abound in this blood lust movie.<br/><br/>They tried too hard to make this 2D classic turn 3D. They failed miserably. They failed because they didn't succeed to bring the 2D characters into a 3D world - they left them 2D. Don't get me wrong - the whole story is 2D - like the movie/book = all black and white - no grays. But what they should have done is tried to create the story alive. What they did was weak. It was only a translation from one medium (2D comic book) to another (the big screen). It totally failed for me. (NOTE: the average score for this movie is an 8.4 - very high amongst the other IMDb.com movie scores. E.g. Some major classics, which you would think should be a 10, will only have an average score of a 7.0 or less!)<br/><br/>I think it would have worked if they actually included scenes from the comic book - if at least to remind people the origins of this work. But they didn't. Perhaps the Directory of Photography was to blame... but the Director always has the final say. All movies rise or fail with the Directors... i.e. if the Producers don't put any limits on them or on their creativity. 0 out of 10, although the lowest IMDb.com score is a 1.<br/><br/>Directing - OK,<br/><br/>Acting - stiff,<br/><br/>Photography - very good,<br/><br/>Special Effects - excellent<br/><br/>Story - stiff<br/><br/>-Zafoid"

"canadafrances","1","10","24","20 June 2005"," And now I feel very, very low.
","God I'm depressed, I don't know what depresses me more; the fact that this film was made, or the fact that so many film enthusiasts liked this movie, more than liked it, rated it very highly.<br/><br/>Last week I went to see Moolaade, a surprisingly uplifting story concerning female circumcision, set in Senegal. This film, written and directed by an 80 some year old African man, was a gossipy, sometimes frightening, at times a little slow, but profoundly memorable film; not only regarding female circumcision but also colonialism, power and the complex relationships between friends, within families and through out societies. Last night, I went to see Sin City.<br/><br/>I appreciated the art direction/cinematography, but this didn't hold my attention for long and after a while I was hardly aware of it. Sin City began at a fast pace and I didn't look at my watch during any point of the film, which is also a good sign. The violence didn't particularly bother me, I've seen loads of films that are extremely violent and though I can admit to being a bit of a girl about it sometimes, I have never been turned off a film purely because of its violence. I could mention the script was quite poor and that the characterisation was quite hammy, but I forgave these aspects early on, due to its comic book style  I wasn't looking for Anton Chekov. What really upset me, the reason why I have awarded this film one star, was the cruel and insidious streak of misogyny running through its woefully misguided core.<br/><br/>I know that there are those of you that say I am taking this too seriously, sure one of the heroes (Clive Owen) punches his girlfriend and apparently she finds this a turn on but ""Hey, it's a comic book  it's not meant to be Fried Green Tomatoes"". You see, I don't agree, I found this a bit disturbing. There is also that bit where a 50 something year old man saves an 11 year old child from a paedophile only to find sexual reward in her arms 8 years later, now that she is a vacant, plastic 19 year old. Maybe I'm just being a bit touchy, but I don't think so. Considering that my favourite film ever is South Park the Movie, Bigger, Longer, Uncut you wouldn't think I was so easily offended. I've even enjoyed films depicting female humiliation  I thought In the Company of Men, was an incredibly insightful, if harrowing film.<br/><br/>What became disturbingly apparent to me were the mounting associations between violence and sex and a painful plot driven by a fear of women and answered by retribution's physical violence. The violence is not just tolerated at times it is frighteningly celebrated. You may say that the old city prostitutes are portrayed as powerful and vicious but they too are drawn into the camera's voyeurism of women subjected to violence (the Clive Owen bitch slap).When not being portrayed as sexual objects they are terrifying, soulless characters or morally circumspect characters. The serial killer decapitating beautiful prostitutes was not there to scare us but intended to titillate. The moment when the camera focuses on the little Nancy in the grasp of a sexual predator is dark and edgy while the scenes where young adult Nancy is being whipped by the same predator are lovingly fleshed out by the camera. Even Brittany Murphy's beating by evil ex-boyfriend is powerfully sexualised. I'm not so stupid as to pretend that male/female relations are not tinged with the struggles of power and that they shouldn't be explored but I don't expect them to be manipulated in such a women-loathing way and then paraded as harmless, if explicit, fun. You may argue that the heroes were also beaten, punched and degraded but they are portrayed as heroes and winners (troubled and misguided but still heroes) and not, more often than not, victims.<br/><br/>This film is pure and absolute fantasy. Admittedly film is often fantasy, that's what we really want to see: something that is a form of escape from the pressures or tedium of reality. What I would like to know is - if the brutalisation of women is a fantasy that so many people can happily cope with, how would they feel about watching the fantasy of a white supremacist stringing up a black person? Would we watch this as happily? I don't think so."

"kyrat","1","10","24","1 April 2005"," Overly violent, sexist garbage.
","I have not read Frank Miller's comic books that this was based off of (though I was told this was a pretty faithful rendition and he codirected) so these comments are only about the movie (though they may apply to the comics as well).<br/><br/>Let me just get the positive comments out of the way. I liked the style of the movie. The black and white with just touches of colors was very nice. The old film noir style feel, with the old cars, the cheesy dialogue, the references to ""broads"" and ""dames"" was all pleasing. Even as I found the constant violence off-putting I was still able to appreciate small touches, like the fact that the blood ran white.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the rest of the movie is crap. I was just dying to get out of there, so it seemed endlessly long. I should have known there were going to be problems when I saw Robert Rodriguez (having unfortunately suffered through Dusk to Dawn) and Quentin Tarantino (who I feel is a derivative hack) in the credits. Both seem to like to show excessive violence just for shock value. (Don't get me wrong, I don't have an automatic aversion to violence, I like John Woo films - i just don't like the lingering shots of needless/gory violence.)<br/><br/>IMO, the film has three MAJOR flaws, all dealing with the idea of gender. The flaw is that the film is misogynistic - women are nothing but sexual objects and victims. The second (relating to the first) is it's portrayal of men as the rescuers of women. Third, the portrayal of a girl/old man ""love"" story.<br/><br/>***Spoilers start here***<br/><br/>First problem: Every woman in the film was a whore, a stripper or a woman of loose morals. Even when the men worshiped them as ""angels"" it was always merely for their physical appearances. And yes, the men weren't all that great themselves, but there was still a wider ranger of character than just sexual object. Furthermore, the women were constantly naked or nearly naked. Even the social worker had to be shown naked. Once again, I don't mind nudity, if it fits the story, if it's tastefully done and if it's both sexes. However in this case, it seemed to be there just because the directors liked to show female T&A whenever possible. There was no male nudity (of course).<br/><br/>Secondly, most of the men in the film (all the main characters) seemed to operate on the assumption that they were rescuing women. Women were helpless (sexual) objects that had to be rescued from serial killers, serial rapists, abusers, pimps, etc. Needless to say there was a disturbing amount of violence against women shown. Even when the film pretended to make a nod towards ""empowered women""- they still failed and had to be rescued. For example, the stripper girl needed a 68 year old man to help her; an entire town of armed whores still needed one man to save them; and delusional psychopath goes on a killing rampage to avenge his ""love"" after a one night stand with a hooker.<br/><br/>Which brings me to the third problem, the incredibly disgusting relationship between the 19 year old and the 68 year old. Now, Harold & Maude is one of my favorite movies, so even though the age difference is disgusting to me, clearly I can overcome that natural revulsion when presented with the right couple/circumstances. Apart from the usual grossness of old men preying on young women, the whole relationship was disturbing. We have a 60 year old cop save an 11 year old girl from rape and gruesome torturous death. The cop is abandoned by everyone, goes to jail and only the girl stays true to him. He clings to her image of innocence and makes her into some sort of ideal image to obsess over. When he is released 8 years later, he goes to find her and make sure she is OK. Where it becomes truly disturbed is when he finds out that she is now a sexy stripper and they decide they are in love. This is a highly inappropriate and sick relationship. She's 19, he's 68. They know nothing of each other (or we can at least presume he thinks he knows her because she wrote him letters - but she knows nothing about him). Shis is clearly suffering from hero worship because he rescued her. He's clearly focused on her as the one last good thing he's done and loves the idea of her as a little girl/and then later as a sexy stripper. It was so revolting I wanted to puke in the theater.<br/><br/>...and they wonder why women comprise a smaller percentage of comic book readers.... maybe if they stopped putting out this kind of sexist crap, we could get into it more. Until then I will continue to avoid this kind of crap and focus on graphic novels that provide *clothed* characters that are not 1 dimensional with a strong plot that does not rely merely on the shock value of graphic violence. <br/><br/>I suggest you avoid this movie and do not pay money to reinforce the notion that these are the kind of comic adaptations we want to see.<br/><br/>There are WAY better noir films out there, fairly good comic book adaptation; WAY better violent films and tons of other T&A movies to watch instead!"
"aschnier-2","4","5","10","15 June 2006"," Should have stayed 2 dimensional
","How this movie ever got green-lighted, let alone how it got into the top 250 here, is something I'll never understand. I liked the graphic novels, but they were so dependent on text to tell the story that it was difficult to imagine how they would translate into moving pictures. The answer, of course, was voice overs...which are pretty much always a bad idea even when used sparingly. Here they make up at least a quarter (and possible as much as a half) of the entire dialog of the film, and for the most part are breathtaking in their banality. If I ever hear the phrase ""Come on, old man"" or anything else like it in a voice-over again, it will be far too soon.<br/><br/>I suspect that people are caught up in the stylistic cinematography, and it is very different and very interesting. It is both noirish and also gives the feel of the comic book roots of the project better than anything I've ever seen. But in the end, the voice overs destroy any good will that the ugly beauty of the camera-work builds up and the lackluster plots finish off any thoughts about ranking the movie above average. In the long run, Sin City will probably fall out of the top 250 in the same ignominious fashion as Titanic (another film that got by on hype and style rather than substance), which was rated #1 for a long, long time. It just bothers me that such a mediocre film could be so much higher than, say, Jaws. They didn't use a voice over to tell us why Quint hated sharks, and that's why it's a classic and why Sin City will be a forgotten curiosity."
"mlbring","3","5","10","16 March 2006"," In The Land Of The Polymorphous Perverse, Sin City Reigns
","Sin City is the title for a series of stories by Frank Miller, told in comic book form in a film noir-like style. Sin City the movie is based on the comic book series by the same name. For those for whom Sin City would seem nothing more than a glorification of torture, mutilation, and murder, this is due to Miller's penchant for Ero-guro, a genre of Japanese pornography and hentai involving blood, gore, disfigurement, mutilation, urine, enemas, etc.. Miller began to infuse his comics with darker themes and stories heavily influenced by Japanese manga strips during the early 1980's. Sin City is his most notable tribute to this form of Eroguronansensu, lit. meaning erotic-grotesque-nonsense. Oddly, the movie seemed just another of Hollyweird's attempts at castration as vengeance. I suppose 90 minutes of continuous rape where no retribution is attained wouldn't get the thumbs up from Ebert? Personally, I would rather my kids were perusing the internet for the usual porn rather than watching this stuff. Each to his own."

","I own Sin City in its original comic book form. All the episodes. And I can't believe how something that nice can be destroyed so thoroughly.<br/><br/>Not only doesn't the comic form fit the movie screen but the sets and actors used are horrible. The CGI is dull and lifeless. Where Miller could draw a stark scene in a few outlines Rodrigues copies it perfectly to the big screen with the result of making it totally unlike the original. It is not possible to copy the aesthetics of still images to motion pictures. The two formats rely on too different premises.<br/><br/>And the actors chosen to fill Millers comic book outlines have managed to do just that - outline the characters without ever making them credible. The acting, with a notable exception of Mickey O'Rourke as Marv, is as dull and lifeless as if showing static comic images on the screen.<br/><br/>Ad to this the fact that Rodrigues has somehow managed to turn the strong women in Millers fiction into cringing damsels in distress and you've got an unappealing paste of bad clichés in a humanity- and female-hating form."

","The good - Very stylish, well shot, high production values. The art direction was great and although it really does not break any new ground, it is certainly way above average for cinematography and style The photography is very crisp.<br/><br/>The bad - Too much pointless violence, not enough plot. I sat there waiting for something to happen, often in vain. Lots of action took place on the screen, but it seemed to be more of the filler type of action and did not advance the story. For example, a woman hold up her hands in surrender. The bad guy (and I use the term very loosely) empties his machine pistol into her. Cut to a silhouette of him emptying his machine pistol into her. She falls to the ground, and he empties his machine pistol into her corpse. As if she could be any more dead. All her death did was give the hero the chance to sneak up on the bad guys - but not all the different camera angles and two magazines worth.<br/><br/>Violence in this movie is like sex in a porn film - hold tenuous plot elements together. Contrast this movie with Kill Bill vol 1, which is very violent and stylized, but is effective and entertaining.<br/><br/>The dialog is also pretty bad. I like people to talk like people would - even in highly stylized movies like film noir, the dialog needs to seem natural. But the dialog here seems to be stilted and unreal in the mold of a George Lucas script, though the director is good and gets better performances than in Star Wars 1&2.<br/><br/>Other aspects of the movie I am cool with. No one is really good, everyone seems to be a sadist, kinda like the film noir atmosphere.<br/><br/>But the production values just cannot make up for the lack of plot and lousy dialog."

","An awful film which i was utterly disgusted with. The rating for 3 comes from the beautiful graphic film work, the style is identical to the comic book. Though I'm not sure if this is a good thing or just laziness on the part of Robert Rodriguez. However, as the comic book was meant to be similar to the film noir detective films of the 1950's the film comes across as taking the mickey out of this rather than an homage.<br/><br/>Since this seems to be what the film concentrates on the direction and the acting is catered to this and comes across as hammy and ludicrous<br/><br/>Though i thought the novel was good enough i don't think the extreme violence from the comic strip worked well in film. The violence seemed comedic, unnecessary and over dramatic. However the worse part of this film is its treatment of women. Once again, though the treatment of women is taken directly from the comic book it doesn't translate well on to film, coming across as much more offencive and vicious than before.<br/><br/>Possibly worth a watch if you can ignore the insistent machismo and excessive violence for the stylish use of colour."

"swampygav","6","5","10","9 October 2005"," Sin City piles on the sugar...
","(Max Payne + Queens of the Stone Age ""Go With The Flow"" video + film-noir + violence) x Frank Miller = Sin City<br/><br/>Easy viewing fans need not apply. This film was certainly not what I had expected - being a fresh latecomer to this one, free from reading reviews, hearing hype-talk and seeing promos (in fact, all I saw was the poster designs) - I really went into it without any real idea as to where it would go (the reason I mention this is because this rarely happens with me, and if you can, go into it the same way -- ironic, seeing as you're still reading this now). Set in Basin City, the film is made up of 3 Frank Miller novels that loosely interlink with one another in a kind of chronological fashion, mixed with a hint of Pulp Fiction (see, you're still reading this). I hadn't read any of these novels beforehand, but having looked up the content of each book (the script as well as the illustrated frames) the film itself stays extremely true to the original in every way. I can imagine Frank Miller fans loving this film regardless, so if you've read the books, this review isn't for you. The mood itself takes film noir to new depths: and I was surprised at the heavily stylised Basin City being one of the more sinister locations I've seen on film as I didn't think the film had it in it (anyone who has seen Dark City will also relate): in fact, you literally never get to see the light of day during the whole picture (not a good idea to watch this with a reflective TV screen next to window in mid-afternoon). This, though, only lends itself to the equally dark storyline and superb lighting effects that make it intense viewing, bordering on illustrative (remember the novels). The CGI effects, make-up, costumes, prosthetics, stylisation and moody voiceovers also push this to it's outer limits, further than any other comic-come-film has gone. Stylised violence, loud sound effects, big muscles, bigger guns, dominatrix queens and lots of death and revenge - the storyline certainly knows how to get itself noticed (rating this film R was probably the easiest job the ratings office must have ever had) and taken from that point of view this film gets a 10 out of 10. The film's general mood is certainly pulled off by both director and actors throughout, and the big Hollywood stars don't disappoint. So, why a 6 out of 10? Well, as a rule of thumb, I extremely dislike anything that is an excuse to use brilliant aesthetics tapped to a much weaker idea - and there is most definitely a lot of that here. I couldn't shake the feeling that it was a film about violence for the sake of violence. The novels, themselves, can been seen as a separate item in this respect - they are what they are. However, the film differs in the sense that it most definitely falls in love with itself all the way through. It feels like it's more than it is, when in reality it is a brilliant storytelling idea and aesthetic doused in gruesome violence, iconic characters and slick anecdotes all chained to the location in which it is set - nothing much more than that. Although it never tries to be a realistic depiction (in fact, it is the original stylisation that does give it some emotional substance in my opinion); the fact that one story, for example, is entirely based around a man set out to get revenge on a cannabalistic killer who eats a hooker he met that very night (""killing his way up the food chain"" as the film openly states) makes me think: what's the point? I got the point after about half an hour, the other hour and a half is just filling the holes and finishing the tale, not showing me anything new or giving me something to take away. As far as Sin City goes, Frank Miller fans will love it for it's superb depiction of the novels and the strong performances from the big stars (especially Mickey Rourke and Bruce Willis) - and having seen the books, I do recommend them as separate an virginal entities from the film. For those who aren't familiar with the novels and going fresh into this, they can never take Sin City too seriously, even though it tries to make you believe it's epic viewing (pushed heavily by the gravelly voiceovers and dry, hard, slick talking characters), or they will be disappointed. If you remember that films are about storytelling and entertainment, then this does have some meat on it, but to see it as more than a violent, sinister, bad-city-bad-people novel made into a film would be a mistake. It is definitely one to see, even for it's aesthetic emotional value: but remember that it's a cake covered in many layers of beautiful icing with a the filling doesn't come close to the exterior. Those of you who have 4 sugars in your tea, this is essential viewing. Anjoy."

That the overall rating for Sin City is over 8 provides an insight into the minds of adult comic book fans that I didn't really want or need.<br/><br/>On the plus side, Sin City should get some credit for including a lot more shootings, clubbings, impalings, eviscerations, toilet-bowl dunkings, decapitations, knifings, machine-gunnings, neck-snappings, amputations, beatings, gougings, blowings-up and tar-drownings than you'd ever believe could fit into 124 minutes."

","Sin City is incredible to look at. It's the boldest cinematic statement since early Coen Brothers. It's stark, compelling and the closest, most pure example of a graphic novel ever brought to life.<br/><br/>That considerable achievement aside, I hated it.<br/><br/>It's the story of a hard-as-nails hero, beaten and bloodied, who fights unspeakable evil in order to save the gorgeous girl, the flower growing in the gutter.<br/><br/>Then it's the same story. Over and over again, until I felt as relentlessly battered by the film as poor old Marv.<br/><br/>Yes, it's a little repetitive. Four stories are told - the story of tough cop Hartigan (Willis) bookends the stories of Marv (Mickey Rourke) and Dwight (Clive Owen). But essentially it's the same tale of twisted murderers, heroes who can take 20 bullets and still live and the most glamorous hookers you will ever see.<br/><br/>I have to give the film credit for staying true to the source material, unfortunately that material is moronically juvenile as this, with laugh-out-loud risible dialogue, and lots of adolescent-friendly scenes of girls with guns.<br/><br/>I just wish the same artistic vision could have been applied to a genuine noir classic novel. Sin City has all the cool of James M. Cain, but none of the soul. It's empty, it's shallow and a huge waste of talent."

Not only that but the characters were boring and cliché. This movie was filmed in a very original and interesting way, and it was wasted. I expected so much from all the positive hype surrounding this movie. I shouldn't have been so optimistic since the only good thing I heard from people was that it was made like a comic book.

It simmered long enough, but fresh scenes of gore, or the dialogue to seed the ideas, does not make a good movie. ""Natural Born Killers"" was all the rage when it came out, but its groundbreaking visuals grew dated very quickly without the solid writing and strong acting of the ""Badlands"" example it tried to update.<br/><br/>I haven't looked at Miller's graphic novels, but having read other IMDb reviews raving about ""Sin City"" (the movie's) great story lines, I don't intend to seek out the originals. Truly, the one saving grace of this movie was Rourke's performance; as with Travolta's resurrection in ""Pulp Fiction,"" I predict we'll see a lot more from Rourke in the future.<br/><br/>It seems to me that ""Sin City"" capitalizes on the same energy as ""Kill Bill- Vol. 1,"" but just doesn't pull it off nearly as well. It's sad, but there will never be another chance to do ""Sin City"" the right way, the first time, again.

","Robert Rodriguez is something of an enigma. Take a look at what he's directed: Once Upon a Time in Mexico, the Spy Kids trilogy, Desperado, and now Sin City. Frankly, I don't think that Rodriguez has much of an identity as a director, except to use some sort of show-offy stylish direction in his action films. Sin City is more of the same, even though I would like to think that there is a method to Mr. Rodriguez's madness.<br/><br/>Sin City is indeed stylish, and is filmed in a way that is different any other film I have seen. Black and white are the two predominant colors, but Rodriguez (with the help of Miller and Tarantino) also infuses certain objects and body parts with color (eyes, blood, etc.). It was especially interesting to me why certain things were colored, while others were not. Again, I would hope that there is a specific and symbolic meaning behind each use of color, but I fear that color was used sporadically and spontaneously to catch the viewer's attention.<br/><br/>Indeed, this strikes me as a film dying to keep the viewer's attention for over two hours. Ultra-violence does just the trick, so Rodriguez makes sure that, every five seconds (literally), there is some kind of explosion or blood-splatter. If for some reason the violence misses its five second cue, there's always some nudity to add to the mix. On this level, the film is a repulsive bit of excrement.<br/><br/>Yet on another level, Miller and Rodriguez are merely going to extreme length to show the corruption of modern urban culture, where the good guys love violence and the bad guys love it too. There are no answers here, and the line is very thin between good and evil, so possibly this too is Rodriguez portraying his bleak view. There's also the mandatory Shakespearean reference that was of interest to me.<br/><br/>Then there's the acting and the dialogue. Again, I'm not sure whether the acting is just plain bad or if it is purposely cartoonish to fit the whole comic book scenario. The dialogue is the same way: performed in such a way as to set the mood for a stylized neo-film-noir.<br/><br/>Overall, I'm really not sure what to think of this film. On the one hand, it is viewer rape, a method of forcibly taking from the viewer every ounce of adrenaline he or she is worth by any means possible. On the other hand, it is a eye-catching statement regarding evil and total depravity.<br/><br/>Whatever Sin City is, it forced me to leave the theater feeling somehow cheated.<br/><br/>Final Grade: C+."

When it comes to the simplistic plot and ultra-archaic portrayals of gender - every hero a tough-talking, leather-necked lummox, every female a boob-flashing damsel in distress (the gun-toting Old Town girls can hold their own, but Rodriguez/Miller had to balance out their toughness by making them whores) - this movie is just more of the same."

","I agonized over seeing this movie. I've never read the graphic novels. I appreciate Robert Rodriquez ""chop and tech"" approach to film-making and I will watch anything with Elijah Wood in it...at lease once! A movie with the title ""Sin City"" and made in this day and age with its callousness and utter intolerance of anything the least bit cerebral caused me many an anxious moment. Actually, I didn't find it as harrowing as I feared. It is a technical marvel but there it ends. Like many movies nowadays...all style but nothing to keep your mind or emotions engaged. Yes, this movie reflects the prurient, juvenile decadence of our day but I wouldn't mind that so much if there was something to it besides very slick special effects. I need more story, brilliant dialog and fleshed-out characters. I was bored stiff after 20 minutes. This would have made a very interesting short but to drag out the thin plot and shallow characterizations for over 2 hours to a very predictable ending was too much for me. I just don't find scantily dressed, cardboard prostitutes and brutal, macho men that interesting. My fault....I was expecting The Maltese Falcon on steroids. See it once and then move on!"
"coldoven","3","5","10","2 April 2005"," Violence for the sake of violence.
","Fans of the Sin City comic will be dually impressed by this slick presentation. It's true that the film adaption is wonderful. But fans of true film noir will scoff at its pop bottle simplicity. What we have here is fire works for the eyes, nothing else. There are stories of revenge stacked on stories of revenge with absolutely no redeeming value. It is violence of the sake of violence. The stories are surface stories at best, a kiddy pool filled with the yellow stuff. There are so many plot holes that I'd have to break into a spoiler warning and take the day off work to get started.<br/><br/>This flick was filled with great acting and fantastic direction, but the stories were shallow and mean. Expect to see no more than two minority characters, expect to see few men under thirty, and no women over thirty. Expect the women to wear nothing but their underwear. Expect the men to beat on themselves until the blood flows out in rivers. Torture, violence, greed, sex, and all with nothing to treasure in the end.<br/><br/>A good reflection of the weak stories is the poor dialog. ""She smelt like you'd think an angel would smell."" It is filled with campy metaphor like it is filled with bullets. It saddens me that this fodder is what passes for great story telling these days. Go see the flick for its wonderful presentation, but look for nothing more. It would be like slapping a gold cover on a book, and filling its guts full of wood.<br/><br/>The sad part, the part that really grabs me, is that Frank Miller, the writer, Rob Rodriguez, the director, and Q. Tarentino, guest director, are all very talented people. They could do great things with their gifts, bring something redeeming to the world, but they don't. What you got here is money making. They know that America's youth is a pack of lust monkeys for violence, and they exploit it. A sad, sad state of affairs."

","I really enjoyed the visual techniques used in this movie. I like how the color was juxtaposed to the black and white; it was a really interesting change to typical movies and really highlighted certain things that were made to stand out. <br/><br/>The only thing I strongly disliked was the portrayal of all of the female characters as helpless sex objects who needed some sort of invincible man to save them. The women were constantly made to look stupid and helpless. Yes, the guys did screw up too, but ultimately they were always the ones leading and making the girls stay away (even with the girls who were really powerful, the guys ended up taking over). <br/><br/>The story itself was not my cup of tea, but I can see how others would find it interesting.

"majikstl","1","9","22","5 April 2005"," Urban blight...
","The trick is not in creating a unique world vision for a movie; any director with a competent cinematographer and set designer (or computer technician) can accomplish that. The trick is sustaining that vision for the course of the movie; making the style of the movie to be more than just a gimmick. This is obvious in films like NIGHT OF THE HUNTER, BLADE RUNNER, SKY CAPTAIN AND THE WORLD OF TOMORROW, or even in more mainstream films like CHICAGO or DICK TRACY -- or even YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN. The style is part of the story, not something that overwhelms it. Robert Rodriguez, to his credit, at least tries to achieve this in the comic book epic SIN CITY, but in the end, style is the only point to the film. Take away the striking images and there is precious little -- or, at least, precious little that's worthwhile -- left to define the film.<br/><br/>Rodriguez apparently is very successful in replicating the bleak, gaudy, horrific nightmare world of Frank Miller's cruel and shallow graphic novels; the question is whether it was worth his effort. No matter how masterfully done Miller's art work might be, romanticizing evil, cruelty and violence can't make something that is intrinsically ugly suddenly beautiful. Likewise, the jazzed up facade of Rodriguez's dark, soulless fantasy can only temporarily hide its utter lack of humanity. Beneath its Gothic shell, SIN CITY is little more than a heartless, decaying corpse.<br/><br/>As in Kerry Conran's SKY CAPTAIN, SIN CITY uses blue screen techniques and computer graphics to meticulously create a unique worldly vision. Unlike SKY CAPTAIN, with its B-movie-inspired vision of cliffhanger heroics, SIN CITY is a morally muddy and sexually twisted wasteland, as devoid of heroes as it is of sunlight. The only thing black and white about the film is its cinematography; and, though it imitates Miller's style, it seems the only real purpose for the monochromatic imagery is that the selective use of superimposed color makes the film's liberal use of blood seem all the more lurid in its redness -- or whiteness or yellowness. Rodriguez's stark visuals grab your attention, for five or ten minutes; but quickly become as tediously pointless as the three turgid tales that unfold within.<br/><br/>The film relies on the good-bad-guy versus the bad-bad-guy code of ethics. In an obvious attempt to imitate PULP FICTION, Rodriguez gives us three sleazy story lines that vaguely interlock and unfold with a skewed chronology. Thus we get three good-bad-guys -- played by Bruce Willis, Mickey Rourke and Clive Owen -- each of whom is an amoral, sadistic, cold-blooded, misanthropic and psychotic killer. They are, however, paragons of virtue compared to their adversaries -- played by Nick Stahl, Elijah Wood and Benicio Del Toro, as bad-bad-guy killers who are even more amoral, sadistic, cold-blooded, misanthropic and psychotic. The fact that the tissue-paper thin personalities of the good-bad-guys are supposed to give them complexity is hardly sufficient to actually make us care about them. Though each are the lesser of two evils, they are evil just the same.<br/><br/>The stories are a crude and gruesome mix of sadomasochistic violence and soft-core porn. As envisioned by Miller and Rodriguez (with the dubious help of Quentin Tarantino), SIN CITY is a dysfunctional adolescent's fantasy, polluted by soured adult nihilism. This empty, grotesque landscape, seems to be what might exist in the mind of a frighteningly disturbed teenager: The characters who aren't presented as sideshow freaks are reduced to the level of vile stereotypes. Authority figures such as police, politicians and clergy are corrupt and ruthless. Women are sexually provocative caricatures who exist either to be used and abused and often violently killed, or are dangerous, scantily clad Amazon warriors with a bloodlust for emasculation. And being male is measured by the ability to endure violence with superhuman endurance, while vanquishing rivals with a casual disregard for mercy -- with castration being a preferred style of vengeance. If there is an underlying theme in SIN CITY it is a pitiable fear of sexuality on all levels.<br/><br/>Like so much that passes for stylish coolness in the Tarantino-influenced cinema, SIN CITY is really just a veg-a-matic hodgepodge of pop culture junk. It combines the hard-boiled narrative stylings of forties noir, the automotive snazziness of the fifties, the crude self-aware campiness of the sixties, the cinematic cynicism of the seventies and the slasher movie savagery of the eighties with the trendy Tarantino-inspired ironic sadism of the nineties. Yet, Rodriguez, no doubt, believes he is serving up something shockingly original -- and some critics seem to foolishly agree. But for all of its flamboyant attempts to shock and amaze, SIN CITY is little more than an extended pop culture slum; and its most profound feature isn't the look of this glamorized ghetto, but the unchallenged stench of moral decay that seeps up from the sewer that is the true heart of these desolate and mean streets."

","I'm a noir fan and have enjoyed films noir from all decades since the beginning of the genre. If this is a modern day film noir - which it appears to be - maybe I should be getting of the train. I don't care what comic book it was based on because I haven't read that. I rented it and tried to convince my wife that it wasn't so bad - and to convince myself - because there were new things. But to me, what ruined it, was that it breaks the rules of noir without creating any new ones that are worth elaborating on. The people are too ugly and too cartoon. Wome in cartoons are never beautiful - like Goldie, who's supposed to be a vixen or something. That's what she may be, a vixen. She's not a woman.<br/><br/>But my only real complaint is the dialogue and the monologue (voice over). It's way too much. Nothing is left to the imagination. It's as far from poetry as it can be. Watch Double Indemnity or The Big Sleep and see what I mean. They talk much, but the words are loaded in those movies. They hold up even if you think about them."

","-Many Spoilers- Note: Skip to the third-to-last paragraph for a shorter version!<br/><br/>Is this what passes for cinema nowadays? Violence, Nudity and some cool special effects make a film good? I don't think so. <br/><br/>Sin City is a collection of four stories in some city full of crime. The first story centers around a guy named Hartigan who is trying to rescue a kidnapped child named Nancy. The bad guy happens to be a son of a senator. So, anyways we should move onto the flaws. The story moves way to fast for its own good, which makes it lack lots of depth. It is like Robert Rodriguez expected us to easily follow along with this movie. <br/><br/>Take the scene with the hit man taking Hartigan. They point a gun to his back. Seconds later, Hartigan is at their base. A couple seconds later, he beats them up, and finds out who sent the hit men to take him. Then, the scene is over within two minutes, and makes the film look shallow. To add to that, a new character with short screen time is introduced every couple seconds, but it doesn't matter does it, because all the characters are all the same! <br/><br/>There are about five types of characters in the film: 1) The hero guy who doesn't like guys who mistreat women. 2) The weak villain who likes to mistreat women, and gets beat up by character number one. 3) The woman who doesn't have enough brains to realize that she might freeze to death if she doesn't have any clothes on. 4) The hit man/mercenary/criminal/henchman that dies within a minute. 5) The evil guy who must be stopped. Too bad that introducing a new character makes up most of the twists.<br/><br/>The second is about a guy named Marv who had a girlfriend named Goldie, who was murdered, and Marv spends the story searching for the murderer. The characters are the same, except the villain is a wannabe Hannibal Lector who enjoys killing naked women, just like Norman Bates (Psycho). This story suffers all the problems of the first, except the action is more unrealistic and the story is way more adult. Marv takes millions of bullet shots, a car hitting him, and some more tortures, yet he miraculously survives. As for being more adult, we are treated to more women for forgot to get dressed, and one who had their hand eaten off by the wannabe Hannibal Lector. <br/><br/>The third story is okay. It starts off with ""character number 2"" (Jackie Boy) mistreating ""character number 3"", until ""character number 1"" (Dwight) shows up. Dwight teaches Jackie Boy a lesson by dunking him in an unnecessarily un-flushed toilet. Then Jackie Boy runs away, and Dwight chases after him. They end up in Old Town, where ""character number 3"" is numerous. They kill Jackie Boy, who happens to be a cop, which threatens some treaty made between the prostitutes of Old Town and the police. So, Dwight and the girls who are half-naked in the cold rain set out to dispose of the body and fix the treaty or whatever. What I found really odd about this particular story was that it gives women a bad name, and makes them look superior to men after they kill Jackie Boy and his gang. Now, do you really want to ""do it"" a girl who could kill you? So, the rest of the story is just introducing more bad guys. <br/><br/>The fourth is a continuation of the first. I think I actually liked it. Hartigan is released from jail, and tries to find Nancy after a mutilated finger was sent to him. (I think he was put in for hurting the Senator's son.) Nancy has been writing letters, and when the finger is sent to him, he suspects the bad guys have found Nancy. It turns out that Nancy is safe and sound, and actually an exotic nightclub dancer. It also turns out that the Senator's son is back, except he is a yellow freak of nature. Why? Well, in the first story, Hartigan ""took his weapons away"" which means he shot him in between the legs. (I don't understand why that was necessary.) So, after they re-built his ""thing"" there were some side-effects. This story is actually good, but only because it takes everything from the first story. It just introduces the same characters grown-up, and the same lines delivered once again, except they are delivered more seriously this time around. <br/><br/>>>>In short; Sin City's story is un-developed and shallow, the characters are all similar, the story also seems to be repeated, (even the twists) the action was disappointing and the naked women may offend some. The lines delivered are somewhat gross, for no apparent reason. (""I'll cut you in ways that will make you useless to a woman."") It's an obvious style-over-substance that doesn't seem to fulfill what we expected. I'm sure there was even more.<<<<br/><br/>There are many hits and misses to Sin City, but they are not evenly weighed. Just because a film is the ""coolest movie of the year"" does not mean it is the best. Besides, for a film considered nothing but ""visually stunning"" and ""artistic"" the action was disappointing. The only thing artistic was the black and white mixed with various colors to represent the comic panels.<br/><br/>If you've seen Mystic River, then you will know the phrase ""We bury our sins. We wash them clean."" So, bury this sin and wash it clean from your memory. Or, you can sell it on E-bay.<br/><br/>5/10<br/><br/>Feel free to send me a Private Message regarding this comment."

","Sin City is a film based on Frank Miller's black and white graphic novel of violence, sex, and dark humor.

It is a word for word adaptation of the novel and told from a narrative perspective. Now this is the most stunning looking film I've seen in a while and the most perfect comic book adaptation I've ever seen. This doesn't necessarily make the film good.

They all do a fantastic job except for Clive Owen who just doesn't seem gritty enough for the role he plays. Willis plays Hartigan, a roughed up ex-cop. He nails it by one, looking like it, and two sounding like it. Mickey Rourke plays Marv a kind-of ""giant"", and sure knows how to play a big killing machine. Rosario Dawson plays a hooker with a heart of coal and plays it perfectly. Clive Owen plays some regular guy who seems to never be able to kill anybody and can't act his way out of a paper-bag in this one.

"MovieAddict2016","9","6","13","12 June 2005"," An extremely entertaining, innovative experience. And Mickey Rourke is BACK!
","There have been some rather faithful comic-book adaptations in the past (particularly recently) but ""Sin City"" takes it to another level entirely  it mixes the medium with another, taking away the familiarity and standards of cinema and replacing them with new styles and techniques.<br/><br/>The first thing I noticed was the pacing  it's totally off. The movie skips from one scene to the next with free abandon. As a result of this, the characters are never really given much depth, the dialogue is unbelievably stiff and the acting is wooden. This would never receive a passing grade in film school. ""Sin City"" is  by almost any acceptable standards  a rebel. It doesn't even attempt to blend in with the rest.<br/><br/>And yet this may very well be the next ""Pulp Fiction."" It's entirely appropriate, seeing that Quentin Tarantino is attached to it (and even ""guest directs"" a scene in the film). He's also the best friend of Robert Rodriguez, who shares directorial credit here with graphic novel artist Frank Miller. (He has a cameo as a priest whom Mickey Rourke kills.) This is a bloody, brilliant masterpiece of invigorating cinema  one of the best examples of how a film can become a testosterone ride, a breathtaking tour de force of images, exotic settings and virulent, destructive images. On top of this, it's the most misogynistic mainstream American motion picture I can remember in years, matching the sexist misdemeanor of the crude sex films of the 1980s  but even then women were treated as unattainable objects. In ""Sin City,"" women live their lives to please their men  they are beaten to a pulp, shot, tortured, hacked away at and stabbed when they disobey.<br/><br/>No, ""Sin City"" is more like a trip back to the 1970s, when Burt Reynolds got away with slapping a woman across the face in the opening credits of ""The Longest Yard"" and lived to tell about it. Thirty years later, the remake stars Adam Sandler, and is rated PG-13.<br/><br/>To see a movie like ""Sin City"" exist in this day and age is a miracle  I thought the producers would have stopped reading the script after the part where a brute named Marv dismembers a man and hand-feeds his limbs to a dog  all shown clear as day on the screen.<br/><br/>Is this a good thing? I'm not saying it is. We don't need to see a woman being beaten on-screen for no reason, nor do we need exploitative violence  but ""Sin City"" doesn't use its violence for shock value. It's vital to the stories. Taking away the violence from ""Sin City"" would undoubtedly leave nothing other than a standard PG-13 action film  you have to hand it to Rodriguez, he aimed to make a good movie rather than sell out for the cash.<br/><br/>""Sin City"" opens like a kick in the face, displaying the narrator (Josh Hartnett), a hit-man, as he introduces the world of Basin City, a dark and smoggy place nowhere in particular, where crime runs rampant.<br/><br/>Soon we're following Marv (Rourke), a worn-out ex-con who is framed for the murder of a prostitute named Blondie (Jaime King). Marv swears a vow of vengeance and sets out to obliterate the soul who killed ""his Blondie""  even if it means crippling the innocents who interfere.<br/><br/>After that story ends, another begins  a thug named Dwight (Clive Owen) fights a corrupt cop (Benicio Del Toro), the latter of whom winds up dead. This storyline essentially follows Dwight's struggles to get rid of the body  with the help of a pack of inner-city hookers who are afraid the police will invade their turf if the crime is revealed.<br/><br/>Lastly we have a mini-narrative following convicted cop Hartigan (Bruce Willis), who saves a young girl named Nancy from a pedophile. He's sent to jail after the Senator  who happens to be the father of the pedophile  pins the crime on Hartigan. Flash forward a few years and he's out of jail on a mission to save Nancy, now 18 (and played by Jessica Alba), from the same creep. (Played eerily well by Nick Stahl.) The movie never slows down or runs out of steam. It just keeps going and going, becoming bloodier and more gut-wrenchingly brutal as its runtime elapses. I can't recall a single moment that went on too long.<br/><br/>The best storyline is probably Marv's. ""Sin City"" has gotten a lot of publicity on behalf of Rourke  they're claiming this is his big comeback. I hope so. Rourke has long been one of my favorite actors and he is absolutely stunning as Marv, totally disguised under a layer of makeup and bandages.<br/><br/>Marv narrates his own story like a gasoline-chugging tobacco addict, his voice raspy and gruff; Rourke's boxing years pay off, as his bulky physique totally eclipses those around him. ""Pulp Fiction"" had Travolta and ""Sin City"" has Rourke -- I can't wait to see where this takes his career.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, though. The acting is bad. Purposefully so, too. The actors really ham it up, and the dialogue redefines stiff. If this were a serious film, I'd have been cringing throughout  but it's not. It is an homage to film noir and a thematic translation of the graphic novels. In that perspective, the cheesy qualities are absolutely perfect.<br/><br/>I have never read a single ""Sin City"" graphic novel, but after seeing this, I feel as if I have. Rodriguez has remained faithful to his sources and created a dazzling new form of film-making; expect to see more of these kinds of movies in the future. (And I'm not just talking about sequels.)"

The longer I stayed waiting for ANY plot to develop, the more I felt like someone was running their fingernails down a blackboard. No amount of fabulous acting (which there was)could rescue this movie for me. I wanted out!!!! This was SO bad! And I must admit the what story there was to tell, was very sad and very graphic, like that could help. P.S. My husband enjoyed the movie!"

","This movie truly blows. It looks awesome and has that film noir feel like in the previews, but it all boils down to simplistic testosterone fueled, superficial poop (i can't really speak my mind on IMDb). Have we, as men, not evolved past this? I guess not!! This movie is so awful, I am going to prevent myself from getting worked up and not sleeping. Warning: If you are a woman and want to be demeaned, objectified, and get ticked off, please see this movie. If you a man with half a brain, spare yourself the trip to the cinema for this one. But, if you are like most of dumb-ass drones out there, see this movie.

"WSP4Life2004","1","7","16","7 April 2005"," Sin City was a waste of time and talent
","Why the hell do people like this so much? Sure, the cinematography was cool to an extent -- it looked way better in the commercials than in theaters -- but the movie itself bored the hell out of me. Now let's reiterate that I am a fan of the three-act paradigm; that is, introduction to movie and characters with some character development, culminating in a conflict that must be resolved. The middle part of the movie (act 2) consists of working towards that resolution, and is usually referred to as the plot. And then finally the the characters arrive at the resolution, and you get a conclusion.<br/><br/>Sin City tried to do this by fitting 3 or 4 different stories together in one movie. I lost count because rather than have 4 subsequent stories, they inter-weaved between the stories so often that I honestly sat in my seat just hoping that the next fade-to-black would bring end credits, yet thinking ""Well how could they do that? There's no resolution, is there?"" When the movie finally did end, rather than end on the note of a resolution reached in a storyline involving Bruce Willis' character - which would've left a better taste in my mouth and seriously affected my overall rating, they ended it with bringing back a character not seen in over 2 hours for the most anti-climatic ending this movie could possibly have concluded with.<br/><br/>I give it 2 out of 5 stars. Why not one? Because each story on its own wasn't so bad and might have succeeded on its own as its own movie. But when I find myself being tossed back and forth and not even knowing that I am coming back to a previous story, having been lead to think it had ended, I then find myself just wanting it all to conclude.<br/><br/>2 out of 5"

","I just returned from seeing Sin City, the ""highly recommended"" movie this week, and it was positively awful. From substandard writing to a choppy mess in the visual department, this movie just plain STINKS.<br/><br/>The movie opens with Bruce Willis trying to stop the son of a senator from raping and killing a little girl. It takes all the usual detours you can expect from crap that Quentin Tarantino has got his hands on. Willis' partner turns on him, he's framed for the rape that never happened, blah blah blah.<br/><br/>Despite a star studded cast (Rutger Hauer!) and a semi nude Jessica Alba (frankly she's shown more skin at awards shows) this movie does not live up to it's billing. It's poorly edited, difficult to follow, and in most cases the actors are saying and doing things that flat out do not make any sense. I understand that the artsy fartsy among you will think this a ""stunning visual masterpiece"", high society's codewords for a steaming pile. The movie is mostly black and white, with some computer added colorizing to drive home certain points (such as the hooker Goldie's hair being a blazing gold color in a black and white shot). Apparently the audience is considered too stupid to catch these subtle elements without the awful color.<br/><br/>To summarize - save your $8. Not worth it."

","Well....I won't even begin to try to guess what the population in Sin City is, but if what goes on in this movie is an accurate sample of your average shoot-'em-up kind of day in town, then I'd figure that an actual census of living, breathing beings residing there must be steadily dwindling down to zero.<br/><br/>If the action in this film is supposed to be taking place in a real (comic book) city, it sure didn't come across that way to me. I felt as if I were observing everything as if it were taking place from inside a film studio vacuum. Any sense of being in an actual city was nonexistent.<br/><br/>In spite of an abundance of very impressive cinematography that we all get ground, squirt, smeared and, of course, beaten into our faces here, this film totally lacks in substance as far as any story may go.<br/><br/>The plot never thickens in this bloodbath vortex. It's all just pure violence (and cruelty) for its own sake.<br/><br/>There is not one marginally likable character in the whole Sin City lot. Every single woman is a ruthless, back-stabbing slut (no exceptions). And every man is a two-faced, murdering-machine... They're all just cowards with weapons, one and all.<br/><br/>The razor-sharp Swastika that is used in one scene as a sort of Frisbee to dismember body parts pretty much sums up this movie in a nutshell. It's a clear statement to me of what director Robert Rodriguez thinks of us, his audience, as he gleefully leads the lot of us around by our collective noses."
"jcbutthead86","10","3","5","17 January 2013"," A Brilliant,Ultra-Violent Visually Stunning Comic Book Classic.
","Frank Miller's Sin City is one of the greatest comic book films of all time thanks to it's great direction,unforgettable characters,excellent cast,beautiful black and white visual style,great Hard-Boiled dialog and tough Film-Noir landscape. This film is one of my favorite movies of all-time,Robert Rodriguez's best film and not only a comic book classic,but a film classic in my opinion.<br/><br/>Based on Frank Miller's Graphic Novels of the same name and set in a timeless Black and White Film-Noir landscape,Sin City tells three violent,Hard-Boiled stories that shows us the world of Sin City involving Marv(Mickey Rourke),a brute trying to avenge the death of his one true love,a prostitute named Goldie(Jamie King)by any means necessary in The Hard Goodbye,smooth talking killer Dwight(Clive Owen)who wants to protect a gang of hookers from corrupt cop Jackie Boy(Benicio Del Toro)in The Big Fat Kill and Hartigan(Bruce Willis)an honest cop who wants to protect exotic dancer Nancy(Jessica Alba)from a Yellow Bastard rapist named Roarke Jr. Nick Stahl)in That Yellow Bastard.<br/><br/>There is many reasons I love Sin City and the reasons are the characters,Film-Noir dialog,Action,faithfulness to the Graphic Novels,timeless feel and visual style. True to the spirit of Film-Noir the male and female characters in the film,whether it's hardened criminals,corrupt cops,corrupt politicians,hookers or honest cops are very dark and cynical,existing in a violent world where the rules don't apply,everyone is dangerous and violence and brutality are the only way out. The three main characters(Marv,Dwight,Hartigan)are likable and you can relate in to each of them in their own way because of their motivations and reasons to why they do the things they do and you as the viewer are with Marv,Dwight and Hartigan as they go through their journey. The dialog by Frank Miller is masterful and unforgettable and said in a fast pace,quickness and wit,with Miller taking the Hard-Boiled style of Dashell Hammett and Raymond Chandler and taking it to new heights,where the characters speak in a style that is sometimes riddled with dark humor,one-liners and aggressive style. Each story(The Hard Goodbye,The Big Fat Kill and That Yellow Bastard)is terrific and unforgettable with each tale being different but just alike in tone,energy and execution that never stops until the very end. The narration is a classic Film-Noir trademark and this film embraces it,with the main characters speaking with a low-pitched,dark tone almost like the main characters are whispering in your ear almost as if you're with the characters in the film. The Action and violence in the film is well-done,brutal,bloody and over the top and fits with the style of the film and will have fans of the books foaming at the mouth. The movie's violence is stylish and over the top to the point where you are almost laughing,but be warned this film is not for the faint at heart or people with weak stomachs. What I also love about Sin City is how timeless it is,taking styles,costumes and talk from any decade and you're not sure of what time period the film takes place in. Is it the future or the past or somewhere in between time. The great thing is we'll never know. Robert Rodriguez obviously loved the material and stays true to the graphic novels with not just the dialog,but the Black and White visual style of the film. The tone,photography and visual style is beautiful,just like in the books,giving us a world where there is no sunlight and it's cloudy and rainy all the time where it is always night. The only brief time you see other colors is in red or yellow(you'll see). This movie is also one of the most faithful comic book movies I've ever seen because,like I said before Rodriguez loved the material and doesn't change anything for the film whether it's the violence,Action or dialog. You can hold the graphic novels next to the film and you won't see much of a difference between them. This movie took the words faithful and true to another level and I loved that Rodriguez stays faithful and true to the books and doesn't compromise the film and that's one of the things that makes Sin City a classic. The ending of Sin City is amazing and powerful because it's not only true to the Graphic Novels but to the genre Film-Noir with harsh violence,brutality and a tragic outcome. A terrific ending.<br/><br/>The whole cast does a great job. Mickey Rourke is excellent and at his best as Marv,my favorite character in my favorite story(The Hard Goodbye)in the film,with Rourke bringing toughness and grit to the role. Clive Owen is terrific as Dwight,a killer who loves to help the ladies. Bruce Willis is brilliant as Hartigan,an honest cop with a moral code. Willis and Film-Noir go together well. Benicio Del Toro is delightful as corrupt cop Jackie Boy. Elijah Wood is scary as silent cannibal killer Kevin. Nick Stahl is frightening and menacing as Rourke Jr.,That Yellow Bastard. Jessica Alba is wonderful and sexy as Nancy,a girl Hartigan has to protect. Rosario Dawson is beautiful and tough as Gail,the leader of gun toting hookers. Jamie King is good as twins Goldie and Wendy. Brittney Murphy(Sheille),Michael Clarke Duncan(Manute),Carla Gugino(Lucille),Rutger Hauer(Cardinal Roark),Powers Boothe(Senator Roark),Alexis Bledel(Becky),Michael Madsen(Bob),Devon Aoki(Miho),Tommy Flanagan(Brian)Nicky Katt(Stuka),Josh Hartnett(The Man)and Marley Shelton(The Customer)give good performances as well.<br/><br/>The Direction by Robert Rodriguez and Frank Miller is excellent,bringing a lot of energy and style to the film using great camera angles and moving the film at a wonderful pace. Great direction by both men. Also,Quentin Tarantino makes a special guest director appearance for the film.<br/><br/>The score by Robert Rodriguez,Graeme Revell and John Debney is great,stylish and full with energy and fits in with the tone of this film. Great score.<br/><br/>In final word,if you love Robert Rodriguez,Frank Miller,comic books,Film-Noir or the Sin City Graphic Novels,I suggest you see Sin City,an absolute classic of comic films and cinema and is a movie you can watch again and again. Highly Recommended. 10/10."
"illbebackreviews","9","3","5","29 December 2012"," An absolute masterpiece in terms of not just the 'Crime' genre but everything about it!
","Sin City is right up there alongside epic crime movies such as Dark Knight, Pulp Fiction and Goodfellas as well as many other classic crime tales. There is something that I love about Sin City that I love in only one other film, and that is in Pulp Fiction. Despite the fact that each tale of Pulp Fiction connects to one bigger tale, Sin City doesn't. <br/><br/>What I love about Sin City is every bit of acting by everyone. All the stories were just brilliantly put to screen and some of the better adaptations I've ever seen. Sin City is further brilliant from the superb dialogue and the memorable characters in it, such as the Yellow Bastard, Kevin and Marv. The casting was just superb. There is nobody better to play someone like Hardigan's character than Bruce Willis himself, nobody better to play Kevin than Elijah Wood. <br/><br/>To me, the most fascinating story of the three was Marv's investigation as to who killed the woman who he loved. I absolutely loved that story line and found it the most moving of them all. I also enjoyed the other stories but most notably the Yellow Bastard. <br/><br/>Another positive aspect about the film is the use of black and white to make it look more professional and to fit in brilliantly with the comic book. I found that very interesting and I must say, it works perfectly well in this film.<br/><br/>The use of voice overs in this film were brilliant. it really was done well when it came to that. At those moments, we were able to take the form of the character's conscience and look deeper into those characters. For eg, when Hartigan is attempting to save Nancy from rape, we hear his conscience say things like ""C'mon old man. Get up"" and so on. This also helps us further understand the characters we are given and actually remains successful.<br/><br/>Overall, this is one of the best and most badass films I've seen."
"Desertman84","9","3","5","1 October 2012"," Best Comic Adaptation
","Brutal and breathtaking, Sin City is Robert Rodriguez's stunningly realized vision of Frank Miller's pulpy comic books.The film stars an ensemble cast including Jessica Alba, Rosario Dawson, Benicio del Toro, Carla Gugino, Rutger Hauer, Jaime King, Michael Madsen, Brittany Murphy, Clive Owen, Mickey Rourke, Nick Stahl, Bruce Willis and Elijah Wood, among others.<br/><br/>Interweaving multiple story lines from the series' history, this violent crime noir paints the picture of the ultimate town without pity through the eyes of its roughest characters. In the first of three separate but loosely related stories, Marv tries to track down the killers of a woman who ended up dead in his bed. In the second story, Dwight's attempt to defend a woman from a brutal abuser goes horribly wrong, and threatens to destroy the uneasy truce among the police, the mob, and the women of Old Town. Finally, an aging cop on his last day on the job rescues a young girl from a kidnapper, but is himself thrown in jail. Years later, he has a chance to save her again.<br/><br/>This film is a lot of things, but most of all, it's fun. It may not be for everyone, but everyone should see it once anyway, just to find out if it's for them.Visually groundbreaking and terrifically violent, it brings the dark world of Frank Miller's graphic novel to vivid life.Obviously,it is the most accurate adaptation ever done of a comic book."
"kluseba","10","3","5","23 May 2012"," The most innovating Hollywood movie of the last years
","Sin City is a visually stunning and even revolutionary movie that convinces with many different and often intriguing side stories that all lead to a fascinating whole complex structure and a bunch of very famous actors that also give their very best in this film.<br/><br/>This neo-noir is based on Frank Miller's amazing graphic novel series and both the novels and the movie prove that Hollywood cinema must not hide behind the Asian wave of the manga boom and can still offer something innovating on their own instead of focusing on desperately copying the unbeatable masterpieces from other countries.<br/><br/>The movie contains a very Gothic atmosphere, many cool and unique characters, a shot of very dark humour, some brutal and surprisingly gore killing scenes, a few breathtaking action passages and nevertheless some almost soft and emotional moments that add some depth to some of the characters. This high degree of diversity makes you want to discover more and more precious details in this film and watch it over and over again year after year. I still can't wait for the second movie that will come out next year."
"themkody","10","3","5","21 February 2011"," Like reading a virtual comic book - filmmaking at it's very best
","Style and substance works equally well here. Sin City is probably one of the most impressive movies I've ever seen in terms of cinematography. It has the look and touch of a real comic book film; watching it is almost like reading a virtual comic-book. Actually, everything visual in the film is spot on, right from the editing to the direction. The film is just pure eye candy, and I seriously doubt that any comic book adaptation, besides Burton's ""Batman"", will ever come close. While cinematography is not the only main ingredient for a comic book adaptation to be great, Sin City has all of the important ingredients it takes to be a great film, meaning you don't even have to be a comic-book fan to enjoy this.<br/><br/>For example a great supporting cast, with the likes of Michael Madsen, Elijah Wood, Benicio Del Toro, Jessica Alba, Rosario Dawson, Brittany Murphy and Josh Hartnett. Pretty much all of them are providing great screen presence throughout the entire film. The lead roles carry the show perfectly. Despite Mickey Rourke stealing the show, Clive Owen and Bruce Willis deliver brilliant, arguably career-defining performances. The powerful narrative from both Willis, Rourke and Owen adds a lot to the atmosphere, and (on top of the cinematography and direction) makes you feel that you are actually part of the film.<br/><br/>Sin City is hard and brutal. It is a pure comic book movie, yet it feels so realistic, both to look at but also the reality portrayed. I found myself rooting for the characters, and feeling sympathy for them despite their dark nature. To add the cherry on top, the screenplay was perfect.<br/><br/>Art movies usually fail because they lack a certain amount of entertainment. Sin City walks a very fine line between style and entertainment, and holds your attention for two and a half hours, without a single dull moment. There's basically something for everyone to enjoy (except for minors, or for the faint of heart), but for those of us who want our comic book movies rated mature, with great writing, intriguing plot, unforgettable performances, excellently portrayed realism and absolutely terrific cinematography, this film is a milestone in the history of comic book adaptations. I love this movie, and I am truly looking forward to Sin City 2 & 3.<br/><br/>One of the best comic-book movies ever made - Moose finds this film worthy of a 10."
"neil-476","10","3","5","18 March 2010"," Polarised opinion
","There are some movies where it is difficult to offer excessive praise or condemnation - one expects to see them gain average marks from IMDb critics. Then there are those which polarise opinions: viewers love the movie or hate it. Sin City is one of those: it is very difficult to feel indifferent to it, and it's as well to know that going in.<br/><br/>If you're going to hate it, this will be because of the very high level of violence, brutality, and perceived misogyny. Well, if you're someone who fights shy of that sort of thing then I suggest steering clear of Sin City. It is violent and brutal.<br/><br/>But the violence is stylised - as is everything in the film - simply because it has been sourced directly from the pages of Frank Miller's comics. You can read the comics along with the movie and hear every word you read, and see every frame converted to movement. As someone who loves the comics, I thought initially that this would be a good thing. And it is, but it's also a bad thing because the film holds no surprises - none, count 'em, zero - for anyone who is familiar with the books.<br/><br/>For all that it is a striking, and largely successful, exercise in converting narrative from one medium to another.<br/><br/>The cast is uniformly excellent."
"idahoblue","3","3","5","30 June 2005"," Every male's fantasy??
","Does anyone else think that this film was rather disturbing in that it portrays violence to women as the norm? I found that the misogynistic and extremely violent nature of the film overshadowed the fact that this movie is a truly remarkable piece of film making. Cinematography-wise I'd give it a 10 out of 10 because to look at, it is an incredible piece of film making. The thing that concerns me though is the easy acceptance and almost glamorising of violence towards women. Portraying women as helpless creatures who need to be rescued by men is both insulting and chauvinistic. I find particularly disturbing the one scene in which Dwight punches 'Warrior Woman' Gail and the next moment she is all over him like he is her hero. A woman like this would not act like that! Not since The Matrix has film-making seen such a radical change and I think they have spoiled it with this misogynistic outlook. Shame on you!"
"supertom-3","9","3","5","6 June 2005"," What A City!
","I was really looking forward to this film. I couldn't wait. Then with all the hoo-hah of Star Wars I kind of forgot about Frank Millar's graphic novel adaptation. However I made a point of seeing it as soon as it hit UK cinemas and I must say this film kicked me in the nuts and reminded me just how much I was anticipating it. I love a nice dark film and Sin City is dark. It doesn't hold back with it's subject matter, that while lurid, and a tad misogynistic it makes for a great lads movie. Speaking of the violence; this film is incredibly violent but comically so, both in the humour and the comic book style. You very rarely see red blood, much like the slaughter scene in kill bill when it went black and white. Sin City is shot in almost entirely black and white with colour flourishes every now and again, maybe for the body work of a car say. Those complaining of the level of violence should remember that this is a comic book style film. Those who love, or would love Millar's graphic novels would love this. Robert Rodriguez has put in every snapshot from the books, every piece of narration and every line of dialogue. It is the most accurate translation of book to screen. This is why Rodriguez gave Millar co-directing credit.<br/><br/>There are three main stories in Sin City. One involves a character Marv, hunting the killers of his only love and trying to clear himself of the crime. He uncovers a deep chain of thugs leading to a Cardinal and his young cannibal friend Kevin. Then there is Hartigan, who we see in two time spans. The first sees him rescue a young girl from the clutches of Roark junior, the son of a senator and nephew of a cardinal. He is something of a lover of young children in the Gary Glitter sense, and has his eyes on 11 year old Nancy. Hartigan rescues her though and leaves junior in a state of near death, with his hand and his pecker blown off! Hartigan is betrayed as well by his partner and left for dead. However he is saved and kept alive by senator Roark who wants Hartigan to be sent down for raping Nancy and for what he did to junior. Hartigan goes to prison and will stay there until he signs a confession to this crimes, the allegations of abusing Nancy of course being false. Each day too Nancy writes to him under a false name, as she now lives outside the radar so the Roark's won't find her and finish the job. Hartigan after 8 years of weekly letters, doesn't receive one, and gets a visit form a now deformed Junior. He now knows Nancy is in danger so signs the confession to get out and get to her before junior. Unfortunately as it turns out he was tricked into leading junior straight to Nancy. So now we must have bloody face-off number two between Hartigan and Junior. Finally we have Dwight who meets his new girlfriends abusive ex. He takes it upon himself to warn Jackie Boy away but when Jackie Boy leaves, Dwight realises that he may hurt another woman, maybe kill her. Jackie Boy and is goons end up in old town which is now run by domina, leather clad hookers, and is part of a shaky truce between the police and the gangsters. These chicks are tough but they wouldn't be able to handle all out turf war. So when Jackie Boy causes trouble and ends up being killed by the silent prostitute assassin Miho, and turns out to be a cop, these girls have trouble. They now have to cover their tracks and bury the body in tar-pits. Otherwise all out gang war will be set upon old town.<br/><br/>This film has great dialogue, whether in someone's head or coming out their mouths. This has plenty of cracking one-liners as well. What really makes this a good film is that it is so unique. The look of it and the style is almost the stuff of cinematic history. Rodriguez has really raised his game from being a good director to doing a film his buddy Tarantino would lovingly emblazon onto his CV. <br/><br/>The cast is fantastic. The three leads Bruce Willis, Clive Owen and Mickey Rourke are superb and Rourke in particular kicks it out of the park. Not only is this a great return to the big leagues for Rourke but this is probably his best performance. Bruce Willis is similarly excellent with his best work in years. Clive Owen also does a superb job as Dwight. Elsewhere all the Roark's are suitably slimy and turgid thanks to excellent turns from Rutger Hauer, Powers Booth and a particularly grotesque Nick Stahl. All the rest of the cast and in particular the gorgeous ladies are superb. There are no weaknesses. <br/><br/>The film's music is also very good with three composers seamlessly gelling to a coherent style. The film really does look great though. It could end up being the best looking film of the year, certainly the most original looking. I love the black and white and the intrusions of colour. While the blue screen method works far better than Sky Captain which at times felt flat with lots of still shots and people running from one part of the screen to the other. Rodriguez's direction is typically frenetic. <br/><br/>So far I would say that Sin City manages to dish out a sneaky shot to Lucas' nuts from behind and is the film of the year so far, ahead of Star Wars the third. To sum up this film in one word; COOL! *****"
"HappyF-ckinNewYear","5","3","5","7 June 2005"," Wow... This was certainly something different...
","That's for sure! Certainly, I see the appeal to big comic book and graphic novel fans, yet to me this film wasn't that good. Yes, I like comics and I read plenty and always have done, but when you see them on the big screen you want to see them more realistic. Yes, they should be true to the material of course, but some changes have to be made. Sin City does not do this... This is literally two hours of violence, stylised gore that does not stop, and the story lines are not that great or well thought out. In the end you just tend to think, what is the point? The film is totally unrealistic, and too much like a comic book (with the people always explaining things to themselves in their heads which gets very annoying). Now I am a huge fan of violent films, but people need to realise this is a film not a comic book so an exact adaption just does not work! Now there was some good points of course, the film noir style really sets the atmosphere and it is very good directing. Also the acting is normally quite good, with lots of great actors doing small points. The violence is good, unrealistic of course, but nevertheless it is quite intriguing (sp?). If you are a HUGE fan of comic books and think they should appear on screen EXACTLY how they do on paper, this is the film for you! If not, like me, you may well wonder what all the fuss is about..."

But then I saw the movie - and I simply LOVED every bit of it...<br/><br/>Usually I watch blockbusters or other ""great"" movies, and this is definitely something different. I haven't read the comics - but I loved it. Just the way it's filmed, the way it's black/white except for a bit of red/green/blue and in the end yellow. The lines and the storytelling was cool, and yeah, that's the only word to describe this movie, cool and tough. I am almost sure most of the people in the cinema loved it. We laughed at the same times, leaned forward in the seat at the same times, everyone was taken into the movie, feeling with the characters and the great touch...<br/><br/>I recommend this movie, to anyone who knew it from before and who did. Yes, there is ""blood"", nudity and LOTS of violence, but it's in such a cool way, that you don't think about, it just belongs, it has to be there because that's the way it is.

"agentorange2000","6","3","5","23 April 2005"," More Marv, Less Dwight
","Black and white and flat. The most striking movie I've seen in a long time - applying the ""Sky Captain"" approach but with an end result that is, fortunately, neither as inane as SK:TWoT, nor does it star Jude Law...<br/><br/>The cast was star-studded but underutilised. The ""Big Fat Kill"" section of the movie was definitely the weakest (except for the scenes between Del Toro and Clive Owen) and could have been left out entirely. Hartigan and Marv are the best characters - their stories, developed in more detail, could have made for a satisfyingly cool and gritty movie. The decision to include a story arc that concluded with a campy hookers-with-guns shoot-out, and with Dwight describing Gail as his 'warrior woman', was unfortunate. As much as I usually enjoy Clive Owen, and even given that this was a comic-book movie, I still couldn't decide whether to laugh or cringe at those lines - they sounded like Fabio should be delivering them. It didn't jive with the bitter loser stories of Hartigan and Marv, two very different characters dealing with the same sort of Roark-related problems. More Marv, less Dwight please, Mr. Rodriguez.<br/><br/>I enjoyed spotting the cameos. Nearly missed Rutger Hauer; was told in advance that Elijah Wood was Kevin, but still got a kick out of seeing 'Frodo' as a murderous cannibal geek - what Hannibal Lecter would have been if he had grown up listening to Wheezer ;)"
"Lessthancurt","5","3","5","14 April 2005"," Great Cinematography, But I couldn't care about the Characters
","It was shot wonderfully, I can't say enough about how cool the filming and effects were amazing. But, I just couldn't care about any of the main characters, except for Hartigan and Nancy. It wasn't until half way through the story that I even knew the main characters name's (and that was with careful attention.) Marv and Dwights fate just didn't matter to me, I understood what they were doing, i just think that this movie should have been 3 separate movies, instead of three movies crammed into one 120 mph ride of a movie. Reason that i cared about Hartigan is because at the beginning of his story they gave the lo-down on him, cop pushing 60-about to retire-fighting a child masochist. And Nancy, you knew she was a poor loving kid that was going to get killed.<br/><br/>Marv and Dwight were just jammed down your throat with no background whatsoever, just that Marv was ugly and never got a dame like Goldie and Dwight was a murderer with red shoes. <br/><br/>Yeah the Comic book i'm sure is awesome, but the film will just fly over the regular movie goer's head. All they needed to do at the beginning of each story was just flash up the characters name or something, because once you know someone's face and their name, you can begin to care, but if you start caring halfway through the story, you just don't have enough time to worry about their fate. That's why i give this movie a 5 out of 10 because the cinematography was amazing but the story telling, character development, and plot were all sad."

I am sorry but this movie is uncalled for.<br/><br/>Story Line? Psh. I gave it a four because it was in black and white and the use of colors was entertaining. However, the storyline was so immature how could you follow it?! Especially while having to deal with severed body parts flying at you and people being introduced and killed in the same scene.<br/><br/>The use of women in this movie was also horrendous. I have never seen such a degrading movie. These directors simply took girls, took there clothes off and planted them two feet from their cameras to get a good glimpse of thongs and tight clothes that our society seems to be engrossed over. It was appalling to see women playing the role of prostitutes, bar maids, and dancers. Not a single woman was uplifted in that social structure without the recurrent theme of violence.<br/><br/>This movie just simply grasped every cognitive ideological problem I can think of with film production today. It was grossly accurate of what sells these days and I am ashamed to see this movie rated as high as it is by so many people who seem to put value on these atrocities and find it satisfying to spend money to see them. In conclusion, this movie is something that I watched not because I was enjoying it but because I was so furious as to what I was paying money for that I had to finish watching it so that I could come home and denounce it at once."

","If David Lynch was a complete hack, he might turn out movies like this one. There's a certain degree of visual virtuosity, and lots of transgressive nightmare/dream atmospherics, but nothing truly haunting or authentically surreal; it's painfully trite, predictable, and shallow.<br/><br/>I happened to see this the same week I (finally) saw SLING BLADE. The contrast was instructive. One of the films was truly mythic, and all the more so for its surface simplicity; a profound reflection on the deepest human meaning of murder and sacrifice. The other, for all its dazzle on the surface, was just a gaudy piece of junk pandering to an immature audience that has not yet experienced actual suffering, let alone redemption. I rather envy the naive innocence of those viewers who think a movie like SIN CITY is somehow profound."

I was scrolling down the top-rated movies on this site and was appalled to see this up there in slot #63. There it was among such classics as Pulp Fiction, Reservoir Dogs, and The Shining. Quentin Tarantino is losing his reputation with the Kill Bills and Hostel, and Bruce Willis is letting himself enter a career-threatening spiral of mediocre films with Hostage and 16 Blocks. And this after working his way up to the rank he did with such films as Pulp Fiction, Die Hard, and The Sixth Sense. The only real attraction to this piece of work is Jessica Alba's pretty figure.

","I've never read the Sin City series, but having dabbled in comic collecting, I have some of Mike Mignola's other work and like it. I'm a huge fan of seeing comic books come to the big screen. And as usual, when something lands on the small screen (HBO) I'm all over it.<br/><br/>But even using visually stunning and surreal black/white film didn't hide the incredibly violent adult story and theme. It just wasn't surreal enough.<br/><br/>It's one thing to be watching Wily E. Coyote repeatedly survive amazing traumas while trying to get that roadrunner - I thought it was amazingly stupid when TV censors called that ""violent - another to watch live-action Spiderman where there are bright colors and suspense but very little blood, but it's another thing entirely to watch one prostitute rip bloody flesh out of the neck of another with her teeth.<br/><br/>Many comic books have violent themes, and graphic novels have been used to address areas that are not easily narrated or require more representation (Maus, for example).<br/><br/>But translating such a violent tale to live action, rather than animation - how soon before seeing this type of film makes violence seem commonplace? Comic books reach such a young audience. I was really disappointed with how violent this film was. I saw a later summary of this when it was televised on Starz, which describes it as ""fiercely faithful"" but ""outrageously gory"" which pretty much says it all.<br/><br/>It was visually stunning, the make-up was amazing, and the stories were compelling. I'm sure that it was true to the original comic book, but I'm not sure the material was really meant to be live action - at least, for me."

While it shouldn't come as a surprise that this medium would be used in a film that is basically a graphic novel reproduced for theater goers, the overuse of this annoying storytelling tool in Sin City is the worst offense I have ever witnessed in my entire time watching films.<br/><br/>Sin City is so overloaded with narration it is more accurate to describe it as a 2 hour and 20 minute monologue with some film attached to it. And despite the fact that I have never appreciated voice over, Sin City is the first film that ever created the desire to tell the actors doing the voices to ""please shut up, I'm trying to watch a movie here."" It's difficult to judge the rest of the film because the nuisance of the constant drone (it might as well have been Charlie Brown's teacher after half an hour) made it hard to enjoy what might have been a worthy effort. And while continual commentary into the thoughts of characters in panels on a page may prove to be an entertaining and effective gimmick, it ought to be obvious to accomplished directors like Rodriguez and Tarantino that what works well in a graphic novel doesn't necessarily work well in film.<br/><br/>Unforgivable."

I can't say that I blame them... I watched the movie from start to finish and couldn't keep my eyes off the screen. Then again, I was desperately looking for a scene or some dialogue that would 'save the movie from itself'.<br/><br/>I tried in vain.<br/><br/>Given the fact that this movie was based on several graphic novels written by Frank Miller, one of the most respected story tellers in the industry and taken from one of his most popular series of novellas... I expected the screen to ooze relevance and great dialogue. Playful banter, sinful doubles-entendres, and snappy one-liners should've challenged the watcher to keep up with both the words and the gritty atmosphere of the visuals. Imagine, a film-noir set in a quasi-1950's era..with the cinematography aimed at making 'live action' seem like it was a comic book.<br/><br/>Visually...the cinematography was fabulous.

","Welcome to the Basin City, also known as Sin City, where women are pretty and booze is cheap. Welcome in the Sin City, where women are deadly. Sin City, where being good means to be bad. To be good in any means possible, because the men who are bad make Manson look like a kitty cat.<br/><br/>Whole base of Sin City, Fank Miller's graphical novels, are hard boiled, over the edge action, film noir influenced stories, in where even the most good men and women are capable of murder.<br/><br/>The movie is told in three separate stories, which have nothing to do whit each other, expect the fact that they are based in The Sin City. Each story is too short to work as a separate film, but in three separate segments, starring different people, they give out very good image of what is Sin City: revenge of the innocent, revenge for the loved ones, protection of the innocent.<br/><br/>Marv (Mickey Rourke) is on his way to avenge the dead of Goldie (Jaimie King), only woman who has ever loved him. Hartigan (Bruce Wills), a stand up cop in the City Of Sin, is jailed after stepping in too big toes, after saving Nancy Callahan (Jessica Alba) from a pedophile murderer Junior (Nick Stahl). And finally Dwight (Clive Owen) is trying to stop a war between police, the mafia and the old town hookers. As I said, these stories do not link up, even though there are some characters shown in the background of the other stories, there is minimal or none interaction between them. Each story roll in the end and after it's over the next one begins.<br/><br/>Visually Sin City is stunning, black and white, with some colored patches in here and there, like the babe wearing a red dress in the beginning or the blue eyes of Becky (Alexis Bidel). Blood is almost in all cases white, sometimes red and in one case yellow. But the action is always brutal, and sometimes even cartoony. The flick is actually filled with dark and twisted humor. At least the people in the theater were laughing, as was I.<br/><br/>There are lots of other stars as well in the movie, in fact the cast is impressive. All the parts are very surprising, like Elijah Wood as Kevin, a mute psychopath living under the protective wing of Cardinal Raork, played by Rutger Hauer. <br/><br/>As for the final stars, I cannot give out ten, because there were some actors that bothered me, like Jessica Alba, who is without any doubt a beautiful woman, but her acting as Nancy left room for improvement. <br/><br/>Sin City is the best comic adaptation I've seen to date: it sets new limits in both visual and in acting. The only thing I'm hoping, that directors wont start copying Rodriguez/Miller style mindlessly as happened whit Tarantinos style.<br/><br/>Speaking of directors, there has been lots of commission about Tarantino being a special quest director. I found that his influence was barely visible and not the worth of the whole ruckus, it was just a marketing trick nothing more in my opinion, but it doesn't take anything from the movie: it stays as Miller's vision.

And Sin City is the best movie of the year so far, in my opinion. It is spectacular in all of its violent artistic glory. I love black and white, which is one of the reasons why Raging Bull is so amazing. It is also great to see splashes of color hear and there in many of the shots. The cast is enormous in this film. Mickey Rourke has a scene-steeling performance as Marv. Bruce Willis plays a character who, in my opinion, sums up his career, in terms of what he says and how he acts. Elijah Wood was shocking as a mute, Bible-reading cannibal serial killer. Clive Owen and Benicio Del Toro go head to head, too. It's great. But, as I was watching this film, I could not help but notice how similar it is to Pulp Fiction, in terms of how the story, or stories are told. Personally, I like that style. Sin City is an instant cult classic, and it deserves to be. It is the Pulp Fiction of this decade, which is quite a compliment. Fans of Pulp Fiction, Reservoir Dogs, Kill Bill, and Natural Born Killers will absolutely love this movie. I can't wait for Sin City 2."
"objesguy","10","4","8","2 July 2005"," Third One is much, much, much more than a Charm for Miller
","It took about three tries, but finally Frank Miller will receive the credit he deserves as one of America's finest comic book writers after an excellent translation of Sin City to the big screen. While the other two movies (Daredevil and Elektra) tanked mainly because the directors compromised Miller's material in order to satisfy dim audiences and producers, the translation of Sin City is seamless, and while Miller deserves all the credit in the world for his amazing story that is noir at its best, Robert Rodriguez should also receive a fair share as well, as a director that perhaps is up there with fellow director and friend Quentin Tarantino. Without a doubt, Sin City is a film that will shock audiences and punch them in the mouth, but for a true fan of the crime and pulp genre, this is a film that is heaven on a silver platter.<br/><br/>Of course, the most glaring positive of Sin City is definitely the cinematography, which should win an award at the Oscars if the Oscar guild knows any better. The fantastic mix of Black and White and color is amazing on the eye, and adds to the seedy tone of the movie, making the movie less of a big screen film, and more of a moving comic book. In addition, Rodriguez's idea of having the movie's backgrounds being completely computer-generated was ingenious, and without a doubt more of a technological breakthrough than the film that tried this method before, Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow. Thanks to Rodriguez's idea of computer-generated background, everything from strip clubs to highways to even barns match the graphic novel exactly and give the film an even grittier feel that not even the best independent pulp film out there could give.<br/><br/>Computer graphic can't make a movie though, and it is quite obvious from such stinkers as AI and Twister, where all the amazing special effects are only frosting on a bad cake. Yet Sin City amazingly exceeds even greater in other areas, such as acting where mesmerizing performances are given from nearly all the actors, adding onto the already fascinating story. The most breakthrough performance of the bunch is from Mickey Rourke, an 80's actor of previous fame from the also controversial film 9 1/2 Weeks. Rourke's performance as Marv is not only the best of the film, it is probably the best of his career and the best job of narrating in a film in a long time (it probably stands up there with Morgan Freeman's narrating in Shawshank Redemption even). In addition, while Marv is the tough guy that stands the most in the film, famous tough guys such as Bruce Willis, Benicio Del Toro, and Michael Madsen also give commendable performances that stand out and give extra balls to a movie that has more than enough to begin with. Clive Owen also does a decent job in the movie, but doesn't compare to the tough guys such as Willis and Rourke, making the 2nd part of the film, The Big Fat Kill, a bit tough to watch. This miscast though is only a minor problem though, for the other male actors make up for the slack, and the female tough-girl performances from Rosario Dawson, Jessica Alba, Brittany Murphy and Alexis Biedel surpass it by miles, making people forget all about Owen's slight miscast. Surprisingly, Biedel's performance is pretty much the most surprising of the film, for she does an incredible job of making the transition from her geeky and boring show, Gilmore Girls into an incredible movie like this and playing her role perfectly. She is definitely an actress that deserves much better roles in much more mature movies than the ""Teen"" dramas such as her newest film, ""Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants"".<br/><br/>Sin City is a masterpiece, no bones about it. It's a film that will get a lot of attention from angry Christian mothers about it's violence, gore and sexuality but the bottom line is, this movie is not meant to be made for children. Just like Frank Miller's comic, Sin City, wasn't made for children either. It is testament to pulp lovers everywhere, people who had fond memories of the hard-hitting in your face action from books such as ""I, The Jury"" by Mickey Spillane and ""The Maltese Falcon"" by Dashiell Hammett. However, the film is not limited to that, for it is a film that is hardcore enough for pulp geeks everywhere and mainstream enough for the casual, adult fan. Fans of cinema will adore it, bible bashes will be disgusted, but it is still an incredible film that deserves to be seen by film lovers everywhere, because it is definitely a film that lives up to the hype and goes much, much beyond.<br/><br/>Bottom Line: Best Crime Movie ever, if you have a pulse see it."
"harry_tk_yung","Null","4","8","3 June 2005"," The closest you'll ever get to have a movie look like the original comic book
","That's right. Had it not been made to look so much like a comic book on screen, a lot of the ultra violence will become almost impalatable (no pun intended), such as the nice little guy Kevin (Elijah Wood) who makes Hannibal look like boy scout. A lot of that comic book look comes from the essentially blank and white filming, mixed surreally with partial colouring of mostly red and yellow. The black-and-white however does a lot more than creating a comic book look. It creates startling beauty, particularly with the deliberate contrast of light and shade. The feeling is at once both retro and contemporary.<br/><br/>The movie consists of three separate stories, loosely linked in the Amores Perros circular fashion, just for the fun of it. What initially grabbed my attention is the opening credit, with the actors' names appearing in alphabetically order (with Willis and Wood coming last). I like it, the resemblance of a theatre ensemble in which everybody is treated equally (at least theoretically) and you're not a star just because you happen to be given a key role in the current production. Still, for each story, you can identify the three key roles: the hero, the heroine and the villain. Yes, they all pitch the hero against the villain, rescuing a damsel in stress on the way.<br/><br/>The first story, with half of it shown at the beginning and the other half the end, has Bruce Willis, Jessica Alba and Nick Stahl. Willis plays an aging cop Hartigan rescuing an 11-year-old girl Nancy from sex pervert and senator's son played by Stahl. Eight years later, he rescues her again from Stahl's character that has become the yellow bastard. Things to watch for here are the spirit of the undauntable good old western sheriff (Gary Cooper?), the young girl's (at 19) crush for the aging cop who saved her and the grotesquely exaggerated villain.<br/><br/>The second story has Mickey Rourke, Jaime King and Elijah Wood. Rourke plays a tough guy, looking almost like ""Jaws"", sworn to avenge the murder of a hooker Goldie (King) who somehow captured his tender heart in one fling. Of course, King wouldn't be wasted and comes back to play Goldie's twin sister Wendy. Not quite the chief villain but rather his tool, Elijah Woods plays a psychopath killer that, as I said, makes Hannibal look like boy scout. This is the most violent of the three stories.<br/><br/>The final story has Clive Owen, Rosario Dawson and Michael Clarke Duncan. This is simply a story of all out warfare between a gang of militant prostitutes lead by Gail (Dawson), with the help of old lover Dwight (Owen), against corrupted cops. While Duncan plays the villain, it's Benicio Del Toro who steals the show, playing under-cover cop Jackie Boy, whose untimely death means the removal of the effective buffer between the two forces. As the dead body of Jackie Boy, Del Toro continues to act, beautifully, in the only sequence in this movie that is directed by Tarantino as the ""guest director"".<br/><br/>There are other fun characters aplenty, such as Japanese sword wielding Miho (Devon Aoki), who might have come directly from Kill Bill. All told, it's a fun movie  great visuals, exciting action, weird humour and, if nothing else, it's such a pleasure watching the bad guys beaten to pulp."
"TheNorthernMonkee","6","4","8","5 June 2005"," badly organised and blatant style over substance
","SPOILERS Over the last few years a trend has developed where we are given films of extreme beauty with little else going for them. Films like ""Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow"" where new methods are tested and as a result the actual substance of the film is ignored. In ""Sin City"" the dialogue and the substance were actually written a long time before the film was actually made. Unfortunately though once again it feels like the director (in this case Robert Rodriguez) has spent more time worrying about the imagery and less time thinking about how the film should be structured.<br/><br/>As the films tagline reads ""Walk down the right back alley in Sin City and you can find anything"". In this world of violence and brutality, three men set out on personal missions to protect the women of their lives. There's Hartigan (Bruce Willis) who wants to protect his daughter figure, Marv (Mickey Rourke) who seeks revenge for a dead love and Dwight (Clive Owen) who wants to protect the women in his life from a menaced called Jackie Boy (Benicio Del Toro). Together these three men show us a world where meaning in life and violence are never far apart.<br/><br/>""Sin City"" is beautiful. It is easily the most faithful comic adaptation ever and it feels unlikely the film will loose that title for a long time. Black and white throughout with the occasional powerful moment of colour, it really is an impressive piece of work.<br/><br/>The film is also incredibly violent. Whether it's someone getting a limb amputated or someone being beaten to death, very little of the film is not gruesome. There are no doubt people who will complain about this, but as so many others have pointed out, the film is advertised as violent and if you aren't going to like that, don't watch the film.<br/><br/>On the acting side of things, the film also possesses one or two outstanding performances. Benicio Del Toro as the destructive Jackie Boy is excellent for the brief time he is actually on screen. The same is true of Elijah Wood who is incredibly unnerving for the entire time he is present on screen. Ultimately though, one man deserves full praise for his performance in ""Sin City"" and that is Mickey Rourke.<br/><br/>Mickey Rourke has had an inconsistent film career to say the least. Never a particularly strong actor, ""Sin City"" could well rejuvenate his career in the same way ""Pulp Fiction"" brought John Travolta back from the film crypt. Put simply, Rourke is perfect. As the menacing Marv, we are shown a character who suddenly finds a purpose in life for the first time ever. Marv is portrayed as one of the nicer people in ""Sin City"", but that still doesn't stop him from attacking, brutalising and generally destroying people. Rourke's performance is perfect and it would not be a surprise if his role is not being thrown around again as a contender come Oscar Nomination Season next year.<br/><br/>Unsurprisingly for every Rourke moment, there always tends to be someone who ruins things. Strangely the man who puts in a weak performance is the one you least expect to. In ""Sin City"", Clive Owen plays knight in shining armour Dwight. Playing a rock hard American who stares a lot, Owen is suitably menacing enough to pull the role off. Sadly though, the one flaw with his credentials is that he seems to find it impossible to avoid switching between the fake American accent and his natural British. Putting good emotional charge into the character, Owen ruins the scene when half way through a speech his voice will randomly switch nationality. It's not always possible to put on a fake accent, but for the sake of himself and the film, Owen should have chosen one and stuck to it.<br/><br/>As was pointed out before, the key flaw with ""Sin City"" is that Rodriguez organisation just doesn't quite fit properly. The film consists of three stories starring Clive Owen, Mickey Rourke and Bruce Willis. Out of these, the weakest story by a mile is the one with Willis. Now if you want to watch a decent film, logically the smartest move is to put the Willis story first, and originally they do. Split between the beginning and the ending, the story of Hartigan and Nancy (Jessica Alba) is spread over an eight year period. Now the story was written in such a way, that there is no reason why it all couldn't have come first. The reason behind this is that the conclusion of Clive Owen's part really is powerful. You see this scene, you think ""yeah that's amazing"" and then rather than finishing, the film goes over to Bruce Willis. When organising the film's run, Rodriguez made a major mistake. Overall Willis's story is not that bad, but compared with the rest of the film it is weak, and it shouldn't have been placed where it was. Obviously Rodriguez was too concerned with his colours.<br/><br/>""Sin City"" is a well made and beautifully shot film. With one or two amazing performances and three good stories, it could quite easily have been one of the best films of all time. Yes it is violent, but mostly the violence helps the story. Unfortunately though, like so many other films recently, style took hold as the organisation of the film by director Robert Rodriguez went wrong. All three stories are worthy of praise, but by putting the weakest one last, Rodriguez has managed to turn a potentially amazing film into a merely adequate one. Beautiful, but unfortunately mediocre and disappointing."

Oh, the film noir narration also got to the point of just being annoying.<br/><br/>I went into this with pretty much no expectations and was still very disappointed. The actors that really had a chance to give good performances were so altered both in look and voice by the special effects that most of the subtleties of their acting were lost.<br/><br/>I must be getting old or something but the gore seemed excessive, gratuitous and generally exploitative.

His last effort could have really topped my list along the KILL BILL VOL. 1 section, problem is that VOL. 2 didn't do it for me and the IT list quickly vanished.<br/><br/>Back in the 90s we saw guys like Quentin and Robert having their shot at movie-making. Today they have total access or freedom to do whatever the blip they want. Now that they've made it, it doesn't taste as good as it was supposed to. How come I didn't like this movie entirely? <br/><br/>SIN CITY is based on Frank Miller's graphic dark comics. To tell you the truth, I've never seen any of his printed master work. As if I care! When I go to the movies, it is the frigging movie that matters, not the previous subject that translated into cinema. I mean, I saw BATMAN without caring about Bob Kane, OK? The same goes with the recent SPIDER-MAN 2 and its comic sources.<br/><br/>Full of visuals and insane characters, SIN CITY wants to be more than just a moving postcard. It's black and white with distinguished colors, most notably red: drips of blood, lipstick and a femme fatale dress. Some weird negative image techniques and really repetitive and boring voice-overs proves that it wants to overcome its own self-indulgence so much that you cannot escape two options, that is of becoming a geek freak or just tuning out. Yes, it is that violent and gritty to unbearable extremes.<br/><br/>Everything is background here, only the actors are real. Would this be Rodriguez' PHANTOM MENACE and SKY CAPTAIN statement? The acting is worthwhile, though. It's good to see Rourke involved in such better material, it really fitted him. Owen's and del Toro's chapter was by far the best of the three interconnected stories and they pulled it out really nice. Willis is (almost) always watchable, specially doing a Sonny Chiba's STREET FIGHTER homage here (I hate comparisons, but if it's the Bruce between this or HOSTAGE, I stick with the latter). Jessica Alba still has a long road ahead as a certifiable actress and not just a movie babe. Rosario Dawson was dangerously wicked, representing the movie's extreemness. And, Carla Gugino, oh, I just love you! No one shines here, that's for sure. Don't get me wrong.<br/><br/>Conclusion? Too much Frank Miller, too much comic book. Too much geeky hype. Not enough Rodriguez (he's never given his best, I hope) and not enough cinema. PULP FICTION is definitely the CASABLANCA of this grunge generation. It is sad because I thought these guys were on to become the filmmakers of tomorrow, instead we're facing acclaimed imitators or tracers right here today."
"craven0811","3","4","8","11 April 2005"," Script that an eighth grader might write
","I'll give the movie some credit for the fact that a great many films have tried to employ cinematography that would give the feel of a comic book. This movie did a better job than any of the previous attempts (Dick Tracy, Sky Captain, etc). For the most part, if you saw the trailer, you saw all the value this movie had, and it isn't so visually stunning as to keep your attention by itself.<br/><br/>But the plot completely SUCKED!!! I can't believe the willingness people have to just ignore the quality of the plot and the characters entirely. It wasn't just that it was gratuitous--it's that it was nothing *but* gratuitous. T&A were prominent, and so if you're really hard up for some soft-core footage digitally altered to look like a comic, they got you covered. Swell. And there were plenty of powerful men killing without regard for either the lives of their enemies or their own lives, and a great many people fight even unto their own demise. Wow. So basically, what you have is a plot that sings to sexually frustrated adolescents struggling with the hormonal rages of puberty. For the rest of you, so long as you both a) don't huff glue, or b) actually *like* films enough to realize how trite the film is, you probably ought to just skip this film.<br/><br/>Don't believe the hype."
"cbell6","4","4","8","4 April 2005"," Don't Believe the Hype
","This film had a lot of promise, and I really wanted to like it, but it just missed the mark for me. A lot of the acting was really bad: high school-production bad. This is especially true of Michael Madsen and Clive Owen, two actors who I usually enjoy. Another problem for me was the visual direction. Mickey Rourke had bizarre and silly-looking mannerisms as Marv, especially in the way he walks. Finally, it being shot on digital video hurts it as well. A gritty dirty noir, in my opinion, looks better when shot on film. The digital was too clean, and sharp looking, and at times it looked like something shot on a handi-cam. Having said all that, there are things in this film that do work well. The Bruce Willis story is probably the most successfully rendered, and there is one particularly ""laugh-out-loud"" moment in the Clive Owen storyline. However, I would wait for video to watch it; it's definitely not worth the price of admission."
"Knuckle","2","4","8","4 April 2005"," Straight from the comics
","If you discount the sleepwalking actors, the clunky writing, monotonous soundtrack and uninspired camera work, Sin City wasn't all that bad.<br/><br/>Three-in-one and not a one of them was in any way anything more than an extended commercial advertising Frank Miller's misogynistic fantasies and Rodriguez's lack of inspiration.<br/><br/>I know they were aiming to pay homage to the hardboiled detective noir thrillers of yesteryear, but Orson Welles pulled it off better (and in a shorter time span) than Rodriguez and Co. did. What we have here is all form, no substance.<br/><br/>Fans of Miller's comic will likely lose their minds with glee over the fact that every frame, every line, every everything was taken straight from his comic books - heck, I even found myself going ""Hey! That's straight from the original 'Sin City' story in Dark Horse Presents!"" But you know what? Slavish attention to detail doesn't pay off when you ignore the big picture. It doesn't matter if Clive Owen's hair looks EXACTLY like Dwight's as Miller drew him if his lines are painful to listen to. Yes, they were taken word-for-word from the comic book, but there is a reason (or three in this movie given the different story lines) why Miller writes for comic books. A monthly serial aimed at a preteen audience in a format where words are read and not heard ahas its limitations... limitations that become all too apparent when the lines that sound tough-as-nails in black-and-white sound so laughably childish when actually read aloud.<br/><br/>It's a beautiful movie to look at, the actors looked exactly like their counterparts in the comics, the sets (such as they were) were ingeniously and lovingly crafted - so why do I still feel like I wasted my time? Because movies have evolved beyond ten-second snippets of a man sneezing. Movies are not only the wardrobe and sets and pretty faces. They are, in a perfect world, an all-encompassing experience that give us something to look at, something to listen to, and something to think about.<br/><br/>I looked. I listened. But I'll be darned if it gave me anything to think about other than ten different things I'd rather be doing than watching this film.<br/><br/>2 out of 10."
"GThing","2","4","8","4 April 2005"," Visuals do not make a movie
","Although the visuals, at times, were very appealing, they became annoying really quick. Without character development, a decent script, and a solid story, the movie goes nowhere. Tits and ass just don't make a movie good for me. I have no idea how they got big name actors to do this film. I guess the concept was cool, but it didn't turn out well. When the first scene started I thought it was a joke. I thought it was going to zoom out and be some lame movie on someone's TV screen. But no, it was actually the movie itself. Craptastic. Someone told me the movie ws supposed to be cheesy. Well, just because they planned it that way doesn't make it not cheesy."
"brianross","3","4","8","4 April 2005"," Lousy
","The only thing going for this movie is its style. The blending of the comic book feel and the live action was pretty cool. Other than that, a ridiculous story is worsened by over-acting and cheesy dialogue. I watched the movie for the first half, bored and waiting for it to get better. When I decided to watch it as a comedy, laughing at its ridiculousness, it actually became more entertaining.<br/><br/>It was very similar to the Kill Bill series, so if you liked those, you might like Sin City. Both are very creative stylistically, but get wound up in a superficial story just to glorify the gratuitous violence in both.<br/><br/>3/10"
"letsplaydead","5","4","8","3 April 2005"," Visually stunning but storyline jumpy
","This was movie was a brilliant cinematic moment. I enjoyed watching every seen, and was fascinated by the way it was filmed. It seemed to capture the best angles and always looked right on target. With that said it was also a bit jumpy. The story lines never meshed together which may be alright for a series of short films but not when the whole movie is together. In the end I did not feel like it all came together, they just finished up the story that had finished telling. It was three separate stories that all take place in Sin City. Not a story about Sin City. I have seen stunning movies, but it doesn't always mean the storyline is great. The dialogue seemed a bit too much like a parody of Guy Noir Private Guy from the Prairie Home Companion. It was just a bit too detectivish. A little too absurd. I found myself rolling my eyes when the priest said he had joined in on cannibalism. Just a little too absurd. As for the acting. I believe everyone did an excellent job with the dialogue they were given. It would have been nice to see a bit more of the different characters, or perhaps a bit more background. But then again, there's not much you can do when your trying to squeeze three short films into one movie. Again, Visually stunning but lacking in a solid storyline. Watch it for the pretty pictures.<br/><br/>Aurora"

","I don't know if I'm more stunned right now or depressed. I wanted to like this movie. I really did. I knew nothing about this project going in and avoided all internet buzz because of the spoiler factor. I loved the previews and the cast. All of it came crashing down. I hated almost everything about Sin City.<br/><br/>The violence is very real but often made no sense. People die graphically but some people can somehow shake off multiple bullet wounds. This stuff made no sense. Between the graphic violence, cheesy acting and the general moronic nature of the film, it's definitely a disappointment to me. This violent boob-a-thon is clearly geared for mindless teenagers. I'm sure it will find it's audience even with the much deserved ""R"" rating but I was expecting so much more."
"ez2buy","5","4","8","3 April 2005"," First rule of film: show don't tell.
","For months I have watched the trailers, the making of specials, read the graphic novel, listened to the ""this movie is going to be awesome"" and I fell into the deepest marketing trap ever by a single film. Then Friday April 1st, April fool's day, came along. I went to the first showing at the Famous Player theatre, 12:30pm.<br/><br/>Right from the beginning I knew something was wrong. This was not a movie. This was the closest thing to a comic book/graphic novel the movie world has ever seen. The problem is I was at a theatre, not a comic store. <br/><br/>The narrative was way too much, the images were lifted off the page and put onto the screen and given movement a few seconds before and a few seconds after what appears on page. The dialogue was cliché and I like cliché but not this bad. Sure the women were hot, the added colours were cool except for the white blood, dumb and dumber looking. The story, well actually there wasn't one. There were three dumb brutish heros looking for bad guys who have harmed women. They all centre around a strip club in Basin City where the main attraction doesn't even take her clothes off. Some sin city this is. A pchyco cardinal, his evil politically powerful bother, a pedophile son, a bad cop and a yellow bastard. What the hell is a yellow bastard?<br/><br/>I heard Robert Rodriques say, who sold out film-making with Spy Kids 1,2 and 3D, say that instead of turning a comic book into a movie he turned a movie into a comic book. That was the mistake. Comic books are not movies. Movies are not comic books. Frank Miller is not a director but people will still pay and pay again to see this. And they'll buy the DVD, the uncut version, the special edition with extras, and the double disc with artwork edition, as well. And they will make another one with three more tired stories. And they better tie up this Josh Hartnet business because that really got me confused.<br/><br/>The first rule of film-making is to show, don't tell. Comic books do the opposite, they tell you the story and show a quick glimpse of the action. For comic book, graphic novel and Frank Miller fans this is probably a great movie. But for fans of cinema this is maybe innovative but hardly a good film.<br/><br/>Innovative is good, but not just for the sake of being innovative. And if that's the route you want to take at least has original stories and characters. Heroes in trench coats work but don't poke fun at it while trying to be a serious film.<br/><br/>But hey, Mickey Rourke was awesome, Mickey Rourke is always awesome. But Sin City is by far the biggest disappointment I have ever witnessed, and Robert Rodriques should be ashamed that he claims this anti Hollywood attitude and sells out films for hype trailers and bus stop posters. 28 million bucks on a opening weekend is great for a R-rated film. Too bad your special guest director didn't didn't switch roles with you and too bad you didn't realize that you CAN(if you get the budget) turn a movie into a comic book but it doesn't make it a good movie. It just makes the stick man in the corner of each page run on the spot as I flip through the pages. Happy April Fool's day, I guess! A lucky 5 out of 10, only because of the T & A and Mickey Rourke."
"hokeybutt","8","4","8","2 April 2005"," More Parody Than Pastiche
","SIN CITY (4 outta 5 stars) Sin City is a very amusing film... a sampling of some of Frank Miller's Sin City comics some time ago never gave me an inkling that it was supposed to be *funny*. It always struck me as a slavish, fan-obsessed regurgitation of Mickey Spillane (with the gritty realism eschewed in favor of whatever bizarre costumes or weaponry Miller felt like drawing that day). The movie of Sin City seems to be more of a parody of those film noir clichés than a mere pastiche. It's funny... but without being overly silly. The movie is made up of three separate ""stories"" all of which follow the same essential pattern: big, brawny guys getting beaten up and repeatedly shot in order to protect a dame. The movie is very anti-PC... men are men and women are babes and the only real love can be between a man and a little girl. These subtexts that run through pretty much ALL of modern ""tough guy"" fiction are mercilessly trounced by the deliberately ham-fisted dialogue and overwrought situations that make up this film. It's the performances that really sell this concept though. Mickey Rourke in particularly makes the most outrageous pulp dialogue sound like poetry as it wafts from his rough-hewn voice-box. Clive Owen and Bruce Willis also add subtle dimensions to their own takes on the same character. Benicio Del Toro and Michael Clarke Duncan have some of the greatest villainous voices ever heard in film. (And it's particularly nice that Del Toro's character is still heard from even after his demise.) The women of ""Sin City"" are basically eye candy... but somehow Carla Gugino, Rosario Dawson, Alexis Bledel and even Jessica Alba are able to come across as more than just pin-up girls. Interesting direction by Robert Rodriguez, Frank Miller and Quentin Tarantino (who did what? who knows?). I had doubts about the over-use of digital effects to beef up the action... but with a couple of exceptions (where the on screen action looked like bad video game graphics) the CGI worked pretty well."
"windrider-1","2","4","8","2 April 2005"," Interesting film style and great cast, but other than that, there isn't much else working for it.
","I saw Sin City opening day, all hyped up by the previews and ""making-ofs"" that I had seen. I have to be honest. I'm a movie-buff kind of guy. I've seen all sorts of films from Hollywood to foreign to cult favorites, and Sin City is at the top of the list for violence. If this film hadn't been in black and white, I'm not sure I would have been able to stomach it. The movie opened well, with Josh Hartnett putting in a nice appearance, but it was all downhill from there. I admit, I was worried that the style would kill the movie for me. Often times this sort of thing is over-done, but that wasn't the case. In fact, the film style was almost all that was really working for the movie in my mind. The black and white with random color gave the movie a unique and offbeat film-noir sort of feel (which was the intention here,) and admittedly. Not only that, but it spared the audience (as best it could) from the violence of this movie. I've read the comic books, so I'll be fair. I'm not a huge fan of the Sin City story lines to begin with, although I found them intriguing and interesting. However, the movie takes the violence in the comic books to a whole other level. This movie has it all. Nearly any kind of violence you can imagine, it's here, in this movie. The cast was superb. Jessica Alba broke out of her Hollywood ""Honey"" stereotype and gave a good performance in this movie. Bruce Willis performed well, as did really everyone else in the film. The script, however, tried a little TOO hard to sound ""film-noir-ish."" There's hardly any emotional involvement between the characters, and the motives for these people to do what they did is shaky at best. This, however, is something I can overlook. I am, after all, watching a movie based on a comic book. Between the script, the divided up story lines, and the truly vomit-inducing violence, however, I can't bring myself to like this movie. I wanted to, I really did, and if you're one of those people who aren't susceptible to any level of violence (as I thought myself before this movie,) give it a try and see what you think. It certainly is an interesting venture in movie-making, but to me, this movie was mediocre at best, and relied much more on a gimicky style and comic-book fan base than a good script and intellectual plot line."
"cartiphilus","Null","4","8","2 April 2005"," Incoherent collage of stories
","I don't know what the film critics are so gaga about this movie. I've looked over almost every single one of the advanced reviews from so many and am at loss at their delusions over this movie. Too many directors can ruin a film. The viewer is left wondering the purpose of the first murder by the assassin. The second murder by the assassin is easy to figure. If this film was edited by a real editor, instead of Rodriguez, it would make a whole lot more sense. Characters who were dead just a moment ago are now alive.<br/><br/>Any one over 50 will see this as some sort of 21st Century 1940's film noir done in semi-color format to look like a comic book. Rodriguez, who probably has never even a seen a 1940's black and white film such as the classic ""Laura"", ""The Ghost and Mrs Muir"", or ""The Mark of Zorro"", has created a collage of story plots incoherently pasted together.<br/><br/>Any man who prefers women over guys will love many parts of this movie. Gail and many of her hooker friends, as well as Lucille, have the sweetest bods and look great almost naked through out the entire movie.<br/><br/>I give this film six out ten stars at best."
"Mrswing","1","6","14","14 September 2005"," Violence without depth = dull
","So it looks like the comics. Well done. So it's a triumph of digital movie magic. Okay. So it's really, really violent yet by keeping the blood bright white it is kept tolerable for a more or less mass audience. ho-hum. The problem with Sin City is that it's totally uninteresting. The characters aren't clichés, they're caricatures of carbon copies of clichés. The 'stories' (it's really an insult to call them that) are so basic, so utterly devoid of anything resembling intelligence, wit, suspense, structure, relevance, depth, that it's impossible to care about any of these cardboard cut-outs. There's a lot of women empowerment in this film, except all women are whores, basically, who exist to service men or be their victims. All men perform astounding feats of violence and survive insane amounts of damage, which totally kills any suspension of disbelief. Robert Rodriguez still has absolutely no story sense or feel for pacing. The short story-system used for the film makes it fragmented and repetitive. Reading Frank Miller's comics will probably take all of ten minutes per episode. That's 40 minutes versus a two-hour film (which had deleted material to boot). And that's just far too much time to spend on these sadistic, shallow trifles which are terribly overrated as comics, let alone as films."

","Ridiculous movie, jumped around so much and not only was it strange to only have red or yellow as the colors, but the idea that the yellow man was a product of drugs trying to make his genitals grow back was ridiculous, as well as the woman soul-eating man, shining through his skin. It was weird. <br/><br/>It was the worst movie since pulp fiction, which was also a weird movie. The idea of there being an old town, the police like Rafferty and others was out there. It was also very outlandishly violent, much more that I had expected. I don't know what the people who rated it over a four star saw in this movie. I like action movies and am fine with some violence on the screen, but I still think this was over the top."
"subgns","1","6","14","13 April 2005"," Sin City is a mess.
","This is a film that hates women. There are no respectable female characters in this film, and it seems to delight in mutilating or killing the female characters. Also, it is jumbled together in a Pulp Fiction style, which was highly distracting (thanks to Quentin Tarantino's ""help"" with the film). This movie ought to have been made into a trilogy. It is a mystery what Josh Hartnett's ""The Man"" character has to do with the storyline. The ""Salesman"" character that became The Man was a story on it's own, and was badly handled in this film. The only part of this film worth anything is the production value and Mickey Rourke's ""Marv"" character. The special effects and filming style are very excellent. However, the constantly annoying Voice Overs begin to make a person long for a mute button. hey could edit out over half of the Voice Overs and no one would ever miss it..."

","...and for the art-house approach to cinematography, I give it 1 star. There were no other redeeming qualities to the film. Without a doubt the longest 2 hours of my life. I would have sworn it was at least 3 hours.<br/><br/>There is no cohesive plot to speak of. (not even the disconnected plot line of ""pulp fiction"", which this film has been edited to emulate; ergo the ""Guest director"" credit to Quentin Tarantino I'm sure) The acting is reasonably solid, and the cast was well selected; yet the film was doomed from the outset (like many before it) by it's lack of a properly crafted script. The jumps from story segment to story segment are jarring and hard to follow. Nor does the dialog seem natural; it comes out as if the actors are reading it off a page.<br/><br/>The symbology of introduced color does not appear to be consistent (Blue obviously means falseness or error in the film. But red means what? And why is there a Ferengi in the last segment? Was not aware this was a Star Trek film) Nor does the ""graphic novel"" approach to lighting and effects really lend itself to the cinema experience. This was, perhaps, the fatal flaw in approaching this film as a true ""art film"" experience; the lack of an internally consistent and recognizable symbology.<br/><br/>All and all a pretty poor film."
"elizaware001","1","6","14","11 April 2005"," way too violent
","This was one of the most violent and disturbing films that I have seen. The story line depicted all of the bad parts of today's society and used a horrible way to make us hate one of the villains. With all of the horrible things going on in society with the kidnapping of little girls and the useless violence that occurs everyday this sort of thing should not be glorified on the big screen. It was appalling and should've had a harsher rating. Even with a harsher rating the theater version of this film should've been less graphic and you can include a different version on DVD but this was just a horrible way to introduce a well shot film with good twists. All of the good things about the film are forgotten because it leaves you with a really disturbing feeling that lasts after you leave the theater."

Acting was stale, directing was choppy and to be excited over effects in this day and age is just plane silly. With computers, nowadays, you can do whatever you want, so this black and white with some color here and there is not ground braking at all. And the plot... Maybe something like this is good for comic novels, but for the screen with moving pictures is just pathetic. Can it be even more simplistic? I doubt that. And what surprises me the most is the amount of overly positive reviews. I saw this film on an opening day, first showing. Since it was early in the morning there was about 10-15 people watching the movie with me. After the first 10 minutes 3 people left. Towards the movie's mid point another 5 people walked out. I was barely holding to my sit. Unfortunately I had nothing to do this particular morning, so I endured the torture and ever-growing boredom. After the movie was over few people who actually found some strength to watch it through were the quietest bunch of people I have ever seen in my life.

","Visually stunning adaptation of some comic books. There's three stories in here: One has Bruce Willis as a cop trying to protect a young girl (Jessica Alba) from a rapist. Another has a grotesque man named Marv (Mickey Rourke) trying to avenge a prostitute's murder. The third has a man (Clive Owen) taking on a bunch of hoodlums (led by Benicio Del Toro) who once abused his girlfriend (Brittany Murphy). And the movie opens and end with a man (Josh Hartnett) killing a woman (?????)<br/><br/>Visually this is incredible. It's shot in black and white with splashes of color in it. For instance...in the opening Hartnett and a woman are talking--everything is b&w except her dress which is in bright red. Really catches the eye. Also it's narrated by the various characters in tough guy prose that could have been lifted from a film noir of the 1940s. It perfectly fits the tone and visuals of the movie. Also almost all the acting is great--Willis is good but Owen is incredible and Rourke is just superb--this is a major comeback role for him. Also Rosario Dawson is strong. Only Jessica Alba and Brittany Murphy are bad.<br/><br/>Sounds like a great movie--right? Well---I almost walked out four times.<br/><br/>The violence in this is EXTREME--body parts are shot off or hacked off left and right and people are shot multiple times. The violence in here bothered me--a lot. Usually violence doesn't make me flinch but here I was squirming in my seat. Also all the women are portrayed as victims or vicious whores. And virtually every female character has a nude scene. I don't blame director Rodriguez for that--but I DO blame co-director and writer Frank Miller. The constant nudity gets a little bit embarrassing--the objectification of all the women disturbed me. I didn't see the guys get this treatment. The closest we get to male nudity is Owen with his shirt off. People could say that the women come off well--when they're killing people and wearing see through outfits.<br/><br/>All this bothered me a LOT--more than it should. I'm giving this an 8 for the visuals and acting...but I can't deny it...I find this film disturbing."

","""Sin City"", came out in 2005 and really makes use of its 18 certificate, delivering a more than faithful adaptation of three of Frank Miller's yarns. Considering I was 13 at the time of it's release, looking back it really had quite the ensemble cast for the genre. Now as a 22 year old having read the books, Robert Rodriguez, Frank Miller & Quentin Tarantino did a superb job in literally bringing the black and white off the pages and onto the screen.<br/><br/>""The Hard Goodbye"" is about Marv (Mickey Rourke), who begins an investigation to find who killed his one night stand sweetheart. ""The Big Fat Kill"" focuses on Dwight (Clive Owen), caught in the middle of a street war between the prostitutes of ""Old town"", and a group of mercenaries. ""That Yellow Bastard"" follows ageing police officer John Hartigan (Bruce Willis), who protects a young woman from a paedophile serial killer, who later becomes grotesquely disfigured. Finally, the 2 minute intro and finale of the film are based on ""The Customer is Always Right"", a short story from another book in the series.<br/><br/>The narrative structure benefits from telling some portions of each story out of chronology. It's not particularly fantastic, but it is nevertheless implemented and works surprisingly well. I say this only because the home release extended cut decides to tell each story separate and because of it, it loses it's tightly weaved structure. Regardless, it didn't hinder my enjoyment of the movie in the slightest.<br/><br/>Of course what really distinguishes itself from the rest of it's comic book counterparts is its style. After all the good I have to say about ""Sin City"", I'm not the biggest fan of the books. I love their classic noir stories, characters and dialogue. However, some of it is really badly written, repetitious as all hell and like 80% of Frank's work, every female is a prostitute. The ""Sin City"" movie takes all the best material the books have to offer, and elevates it somewhat with really talented performers and recreating some scenes right out of the book itself.<br/><br/>Other than that, I urge you to read up on how they made the movie. It's pretty spectacular when you realise that some of the interactions between the actors never happened, as they were still awaiting to be casted. The few colours they choose to implement is sparse yet effective, when you see it all in it's entirety the CGI visuals are pretty unforgettable. Some of my peers won't watch a classic 1940's film-noir story, yet they'll watch ""Sin City"". I've got to get some new friends.<br/><br/>Final Verdict: As I write, ""Sin City"" is nearly a decade old. Yet the execution and efforts of everyone involved are going to make it somewhat timeless, and some of the best of genre has to offer. 10/10."

","I never heard of the graphic novel Sin City. I just decided to watch the movie because it looked different. Sin City is a movie with a group of different stories that all tie in. The plot is different than what I am used to; but that's why it was such a hit with me. The opening is great Josh Hartnett as the man, he has an intro to Sin City. The opening story with Hartigan( Bruce Willis . An older cop forced into retirement due to a heart ailment. He and his partner Bob( Michael Madsen) are tracking down Roark Jr. ( Nick Stahl), who is a child molester. Once he and bob find him, Hartigan shoots him where it counts. Hartigan is a hero to Nancy(Jessica Alba), story is to be continued. The next story Marv & Goldie, I like to call it. Marv is a pill popping guy who is definitely on the rough side. He meets Goldie(Jamie King)who he loves. They spend the night together and when Marv wakes he realizes Goldie is dead. Marv runs to his parole officer because Cardinal Roark is letting him take the fall. The Cardinal is covering up for Kevin ( Elijah Wood). Kevin is a cannibal who dines on the flesh of the prostitutes of Old Town. Marv tells Becky, his parole officer what has happened. She explains to him who she thinks has done it, where, and who Kevin is related to. He meets Wendy( Jamie King), Goldie's twin; she thinks he is responsible for the murder of her sister. The two team up after Marv explains to he what happens. They head up to The Farm, a secluded house outside Basin City. Once there Marv kills Kevin and makes sure some of Kevin is left for the guard dog. The story fades and now we meet Johnny Boy( Benicio Del Toro). We arrive at Shellie's( Brittany Murphy). Johnny is banging on the door wanting in. Once he is in Johnny meets Dwight(Clive Owen), Shellie's new beau. The two get into a fight and continues into Old Town. In Old Town the streets are run by the hooker's, the girl's have a truce with the cops. Old Town is off limits to cops, pimps, and the mob. Johnny Boy and crew arrive looking for action. Dwight, Gail( Rosiaro Dawson) and the girls meet Johnny and crew, A.K.A. Det. Rafferty. A brutal Fight breaks out, killing Johnny and friends. When everyone find out who Johnny really is, an undercover cop, they realize the truce is threatened. They get rid of the evidence, but one of the girls has ratted them out. This is were the mob comes into play. In the end Old Town is saved, and Dwight and Gail are together again. We then return to part 2 of Hartigan. He wakes up in the hospital, we met Senator Roark(Powers Booth). He explains to Hartigan that they have taken care of all his medical bills, and cured his heart ailment. This is no good deed it will come with a price; so Senator Roark's kid will not be prosecuted for the crimes he has done. Hartigan gets out of the hospital; but Sen. Roark gets his way. Hartigan is beaten into signing a bogus confession on the child molestation charges. He is off to prison where he will be doing 8 years. Nancy faithfully sends him letters while there. We are met with Roark Jr. again; but he is transformed into some freak. They call him yellow bastard, due to his skin color. Sen. Roark tried to reattach his manhood back but instead all he got was side effects. He smells really bad like rotting garbage. Hartigan one day realizes he doesn't get a letter. He realizes 8 years is gone by meets the parole board and is out. Once out he vows to find Nancy to she if she is O.K.; and little does he know yellow bastard is right on the trail. Hartigan goes to Nancy's apartment and realizes it's been broken into. He notices on a table a set of matches from a bar and goes there. He walks in and discovers Nancy is a dancer, she doesn't want her to see him. They both find each other and she is so happy to see him. Yellow bastard is in the bar and wants to finishes what he started 8 years ago but never got to finish. Yellow bastard kidnaps Nancy and Hartigan is right behind him, back to The Farm. Once Hartigan finds Nancy at The Farm he kills yellow bastard, then pulls the trigger on himself. The closing of the movie Josh Hartnett in a hospital elevator with closing words. In Conclusion this is a great film. I am looking to get the extended cut soon. I recommend this movie to any sci-fi fan, comic fan, or basically anybody. This movie is a guaranteed winner.<br/><br/>THX, Kris L. CocKayne"
"dom-lerose-8","Null","2","3","23 June 2014"," 'Sin City' is visually magnificent as it takes comic-book films to an entirely different level, and is pure awesomeness!
","Viusal masterpieces provide some of the best entertainment in history. Especially in film. In Robert Rodriguez's 'Sin City' you see a comic- book film that is completely original and extremely entertaining. 'Sin City' is a popular comic book series about a dark city that is manipulated by corruption, violence, and prostitution. There are dozens of characters, but the main characters are Hartigan, Marv, Nancy, Dwight, and Rourke. Hartigan is played by Bruce Willis and is an old cop who's mission is to save young Nancy Callahan from the evil child molester Rourke. Nancy is a stripper who's dream was to someday see Hartigan after saving her life. Marv is an ex-con who is out of control and is on a vengeful mission to find the killer of his loved Goldie, also a prostitute. Dwight is a bad-ass detective who gets into all sorts of trouble by protecting the streets of Sin City. As all the stories emerge you see tons of action like you can't believe and lots of other side characters that make the story extra rich. Robert Rodriguez directs this violent delight awesomely and guides every film aspect to give us a delightful guilty pleasure. The visual effects to make the film look like a motion comic-book are unique and cool and give style to this gritty story and portray a corrupt location like never before. The black and white style and occasional colored object like in 'Schindler's List' is very unique and provides this raw joy-ride the cinematic elements to make this one of the coolest films of all time."

","A brilliant adaptation of the Frank Miller series of graphic novels. Great plot. Or should I say plots, as there are a few stories which seem to run in parallel, and then briefly intersect. <br/><br/>Incredibly original in its combining filmed material and animation (through the use of green screen technology, apparently). Probably the most unique and superbly done movie ever made, in terms of CGI.<br/><br/>Superb direction by Michael Rodriguez, assisted by Frank Miller himself, and Quentin Tarantino.<br/><br/>Great acting performances by an all-star cast: Bruce Willis, Mickey Rourke, Clive Owen, Benicio Del Toro, Rasario Dawson, Jessica Alba,Josh Hartnett, Carla Gugino, Michael Clarke Duncan, Elijah Wood.<br/><br/>Slick, gritty, graphic, great."
"KineticSeoul","9","2","3","22 March 2013"," One of the best adaptation or transition from graphic novel to film
","I would say this is one of the best graphic novel series to film, but it feels more like a transition. In fact this is the closest I ever seen a graphic novel series to a film. It almost literally is like watching a graphic novel in film form and the visuals are just amazing. The plot has 3 different stories taking place in Sin City. And has 3 main male protagonists who are the epitome of badasses that have a soft spot for women. In fact the villains are the ones that treat women like trash in this flick. The character Marv(Mickey Rourke) is the brute force badass and tough as a human character in a movie can get. I can't think of anyone else that could of played Marve besides Mickey Rourke, he is just downright perfect for this role. In fact it's like Frank Miller designed Marv around Mickey Rourke, kinda like the new Nick Fury for Samuel L. Jackson. Next story's protagonist is Dwight McCarthy(Clive Owen) who is the slick and cool badass. And the third stories badass is Det. John Hartigan played by an actor who made his career from playing badass characters, none other than Bruce Willis himself. Overall this is one of the most entertaining, thrilling, gripping, violent and visually awesome movie I seen. This is what you get when a film is directed by Robert Rodriguez, co-directed by Frank Miller and guest directed by Quentin Tarantino.<br/><br/>9/10"

","Sin City comes straight out of its comic book pages with its incredible visuals. It presents you with gritty heroes who'll get their hands dirty to make sure good triumphs over evil, and you'll cheer them on with all your heart. They are confronted with the worst of the worst kind of human beings imaginable.<br/><br/>Frank Miller and Robert Rodriguez team up, with extra director Quentin Tarantino to deliver a violent and very bloody movie that fortunately doesn't show it too much because of the visual style.<br/><br/>My favorite story is gladiator one, then the cop with a heart problem.<br/><br/>Mickey Rourke is perfect as the violent yet dame-friendly super killing machine. Bruce Willis is just as good with the cop who will give anything to protect a young innocent girl. Jessica Alba is the sweetest, hottest, most adorable stripper you'll ever meet. Rosario Dawson is spectacular as the valkyrie hooker. Brittany Murphy is right on as the abuse victim waitress. Rutger Hauer has the small part of the cardinal but plays it well. Finally, it's probably Clive Owen's best career performance, since his acting range is rather limited.<br/><br/>The dialogs might be a bit weak at times, but it is keeping with the style of the film, so there's no faulting them. Some acting, mostly from the extras is rather unsatisfying, but it's not too distracting.<br/><br/>In conclusion, if you want action, violence, and good versus evil, all done in a very special visual style, this is it."

","Sin City is a Frank Miller graphic comic brought to the screen by Miller as co-director along with Robert Rodriguez. It is violently entertaining ride from start to finish. Mickey Rourke is Marv, wearing such incredible prosthetics, that I didn't realize it was him until I read the credits. There are several story lines and Rourke's is my favorite. He awakens next to a murdered prostitute and is framed by corrupt policemen. He is in and out of the story while seeking the real killer and uncovering a web of deception.<br/><br/>The second most interesting character is Rutger Hauer as Cardinal Patrick Henry Roaring, a rather nasty man of the cloth with disgusting tastes; a deeply disturbed individual. The confrontation between the Cardinal and Marv(Rourke) is one of the most vicious and memorable scenes since Michael Madsen's ear cutting scene in ""Reservoir Dogs."" Of course co-director Rodriguez is good friends with Quentin Tarantino's, and Q.T. directed one of the segments here.<br/><br/>Bruce Willis also appears as a older cop in bad health trying to save a stripper played by the beautiful Jessica Alba, in a father-daughter relationship which is one of the plot lines from Miller's books.<br/><br/>Many other characters appear including Brittany Murphy and Rossario Dawson as prostitutes and the aforementioned Michael Madsen as a cop. The ensemble is without weakness and this looks like a comic book translated to film with vivid colors of same. A sequel is in the works and I have high expectations."

","IMDb Top 250: 108<br/><br/>Can you tolerate extreme violence, lavish sexiness and black comedy? It all awaits you in Sn City: an unbelievably cool and gritty film, a heavily, heavily stylized neo-noir, and a 'comic book come to life'. Take a still shot from the film and you could confuse it with a detailed comic. Before discussing the rest of the film I'll get this out of the way: Sin City is the most visually arresting film I have seen thus far, and is an artistically amazing piece of art.<br/><br/>After an interesting prologue to hotwire a viewer into the Sin City style, we are treated to a very Grand Theft Auto-esque opening credits, with comic book characters and their respective actors, accompanied by the slickest theme music in recent memory. Then we are thrown into the first of several tales of crime, hookers and violence- which at their core are really stories of love and its... derivatives. The stories a very engaging and twisted, and offer good closure. And they're refreshingly straightforward, surprising considering Tarantino is onboard as a 'special guest director'.<br/><br/>As over the top as the art style is, the characters are just as big. There's no singular protagonist, but a cast of heroes and villains. Hartigan is a true hero, the incorruptible savior. In contrast, the other major 'hero', Marv, is just a simple and passionate man. Much less physically imposing than these two is Dwight, the closest thing to a straight character, but who still has his quirks. The entire support is great, including Jackie Boy and the sickening Yellow Bastard, as well as by all the female cast, who are either strippers, dancers, or an assassin. Special note goes to the character of Kevin, played eerily by Elijah Wood. He's absolutely terrifying, especially with the hypnotic theme that always plays in his presence. The cast is amazing, and everyone has a large dose of 'comic' in their performances.<br/><br/>As stylish as the visuals are, the action equals. Men go flying after punches,blood sprays, and cars fly over bumps. There are many astounding scenes of violence, as well as monologues and narrations only possible in a film like this. The action is over the top, the carnage outrageously brutal, with hints of absolute black comedy. (Swastika shurikens? The Yellow Bastard?) <br/><br/>Sin City has fantastic, loving direction, and is a magnificent technical and artistic achievement that cranks to '10' in every category but swearing. It's a top tier noir, and a very unique film. If it was a wholly original concept for the screen I think it could have been lauded even more. If you can handle this, see it. 8.9/10"

The great thing about Sin City aside from it's slick and stylish visuals, is it's flawless adaption from Frank Miller's groundbreaking graphic novel, with great actors, great action, and a whole lot of badass girls who can kick the asses of the 'Sucker Punch' girls any day. Next to 'The Dark Knight' this is the best comic book film ever. As an avid fan of Frank Miller's original 'Sin City' graphic novels, I was ecstatic hearing a film adaption was being helmed by the great Robert Rodriguez, Quentin Tarantino, and Miller himself.<br/><br/>Looks like the movie gods teamed up on this one because this is a very well-casted film. The three main leads consist of Bruce Willis, Micky Rourke, and Clive Owen, who give the most twisted performances of their careers. The characters are all involved in three ""intertwining"" stories, that are perfect and flawless adaptations from the graphic novel, literally. You can read the book and watch the film at the same time and wouldn't notice a thing different. Hell, even the stylized color choices are the same! The fact that the only colors gracing the screen are black, white, yellow, and the occasional use of substantial, bloody, gory, violent, body limbs flying around. The gals of the film are quite stunning, from both an acting and visual standpoint. Carla Gugino, Jessica Alba, Alexis Bledel, Rosario Dawson, and Devon Aoki are the first-class women of the film, and are quite the eye-candy for us guys.<br/><br/>Mature, stylistic, complex, and cohesive; Sin City is a true masterpiece.

","Sin City is a film noir based on Frank Miller's graphic novel series of the same name. The story is about three tough guys in depraved Basin City who try to save the women they love.<br/><br/>The film is one of the truest transfers of comic-book to film, a ferociously stylised piece which successfully creates its own pulp universe. Still, it's a singularly repellent one, in which the women are prostitutes across the board, and the violence is unredeemed by any underlying humanity.

","Alert! One of the best films i've caught this year so far!! Highly recommended is all I can say and I'm crossing my fingers that it will be nominated for the Academy Awards for Best Lighting and lots more. Thank god to the Board of Censorship for not snipping anything off cos that's how it shld be to portray the 'sins' well.<br/><br/>While watching the opening credits, am surprised to find out that it has a stellar cast of great actors: ranking from top of my charts Benicio Del Toro (he's good!), Clive Owen (love his voice), Mickey Rourke (never say die), Bruce Willis (Mr Goody Paedophile), Elijah Wood (at his scariest!!) and even cutey Josh Hartnett (i dun mind dying in his arms). The girls didn't do too bad also but was sadly overshadowed by the guys: Devon Aoki (cool blades), the lesbian (nice boobs), Brittany Murphy (waitress waiting to be slapped), Alexis Bledel (gilmore gal became pro) and Jessica Alba (high pain threshold).<br/><br/>Poster_jack Shown in black & white, with splashes of colours once in a while for significance and emphasis, this is a film noir with beautiful lighting. 3 stories were told, with one split apart from beginning and end of film as it spans a few years. Bruce Willis as hero who became a paedophile was the first; Mickey Rourke as an ugly giant who really enjoys torturing others as well as himself; Clive Owen & Benicio Del Toro who forms an interesting partnership together while in a car.<br/><br/>Monologues form the main part of storytelling by the main characters and there were lots of blood and sadistic scenes being played out that is both sick and wonderful. The sickest scene I would have to give to Elijah Wood's character, extremely quiet but very scary. I love Benicio Del Toro in this movie! So funny trying to act tough but actually is a weakling who preys on women to prove otherwise.<br/><br/>Adapted from the comic created by Frank Miller, it's great to have him co-direct and also together with guest director Quentin Tarantino, this film was set to be a bloody great one literally so please all sadistic fans, watch it! PS: Ehmm.maybe the sickest moment was when Bruce Willis kissed Jessica Albaewww!!"

","As I have previously stated, I am a comic book fan, and one of few girls to be so. I love blood, and violence, and gore, and fighting, and all that other stuff. I read by someone who commented on this movie that it was sexist against females, and the only people who could possibly enjoy this movie were males. To that, I say to you: I am a GIRL, and I enjoyed this movie.<br/><br/>Yes, there will be blood. Is that supposed to shock you? It shouldn't. Yes, there is violence. The title suggests that and more. But if you think to take a look at the comic book, the book has that too.You're not required to like it, or watch it. If you don't like violence, or blood, or gore, go watching something else. I rest my case.<br/><br/>I LOVED this movie. What a stunning display of cinematography! First of all, I love the stylized representation of the film in general. You feel as if you had actually been sucked into the comic book. I also love how Robert Rodriguez, who I am a fan of, chose to highlight certain colors to bring out the feel of the movie, such as red, blue and yellow. I also liked the way in which the movies were shot. It may surprise some, or perhaps not, to know that this entire movie is one of the first to be shot almost entirely on green screen with a digital film screening system. The backgrounds, the city...all digital. What an achievement. And for those who bought the Extended Version of this movie like I did, you can view the entire movie in green screen (fast-foward motion, by the way) to see how they achieved certain things in principal photography. Get the Extended Version, you won't be sorry. I wasn't. Yes, it was very violent. But so was Saw, and people enjoyed that. 90% of movies today have some amount of violence in them. But the violence, however overdone it may appear, is inevitable if you were to be shooting a comic book such as Sin City. The same amount of violence is present in the comic book as well. Check if you don't believe me. Yes, there was nudity. Perhaps that is where many girls got up and left the theater, or called it ""sexist"". As to me, I just sort of looked the other way and said to my boyfriend: ""Those poor girls.They'll have all the perverted guys knowing them forever now."" Newsflash to the same people who called this sexist and pornographic:<br/><br/>1. It is a comic book. What do you expect?<br/><br/>2. It is an R-rated movie. Of course there will be some risqué scenes it!<br/><br/>3. Pornography isn't shown in public movie theaters.<br/><br/>Just like the comic book, this movie has (4) stories: <br/><br/>1. ""The Customer is Always Right"": A hit-man (Josh Hartnett) is dispatched to kill a broad (Marley Shelton) who fears that she is in danger from someone else.<br/><br/>2. ""The Hard Goodbye"": A tough-guy (Mickey Rourke) wakes up to discover that the seductive, gorgeous woman he happened to pick up that night (Jamie King) has been silently murdered by a stealthy, cannibalistic serial killer (Elijah Wood), and tries to work his way down to the truth of it all.<br/><br/>3. ""The Big Fat Kill"": A barmaid (Brittany Murphy) runs into trouble with an ex (Benicio del Toro), and her new boyfriend (Clive Owen) helps prostitute Gail (Rosario Dawson) and fellow prostitutes fight mob-men in the alleyways of Sin City.<br/><br/>4. ""That Yellow Bastard"": Determined ex-cop (Bruce Willis) relives how he met the love of his life (Jessica Alba) by saving her from a rapist, and works hard to save her once again from a mutated, sadistic killer (Nick Stahl).<br/><br/>*: There is a minor scene at the end of the movie that was added specifically for the movie, featuring one traitorous (see ""The Big Fat Kill"" story) prostitute (Alexis Bledel) and the fate that befalls her from a certain hit-man (Josh Hartnett).<br/><br/>The cast that made up these stories were exceptional. What really took me by surprise was seeing Mickey Rourke as the perfect incarnation of Marv. Who knew Rourke could box and act? I also was really amazed by the fierceness and kick-ass fighting of the women in ""The Big Fat Kill"". That's right, the WOMEN were the best ass-kickers in the whole movie. Even the guys will agree. Still think this movie is a sexist film? This movie is certainly not a family film, but for those who can appreciate it, it's one hell of a ride.<br/><br/>9/10 stolen trench-coats. Take a tour of Sin City."

","Maybe I should not have watched this movie. It was not the type of my taste by all means. If I liked to watch Pulp Fiction, this one is a totally different story. The movie got a very high rating which certainly get me puzzled after watching the first two parts of the movie.<br/><br/>This movie has three independent sections where each one of them explains how a 'hero' defeats all the evil people. Strangely, he always get help from 'whores' and 'whores'. Suddenly, it appears this 'hero' is not a good guy either. Of course, it can't be that clear a movie is about good guys beating bad guys, cause they are all bad. However, the story drags on showing breasts and bodies (under tight mesh dress), with no surprising story telling. Every step is anticipated. Sure, the evil people are worse criminals, but they are not stupid.<br/><br/>The worship of Japaness sword is also unpleasant. Its first appearance in Kill Bill puts it to certain special meaning which never exist in real life. Well, it may just be my unpleasant after all.<br/><br/>The Black and White screen makes me think of Kill Bill as well, except here they have some red and green and blue from time to time. Maybe this is the only interesting part which owns the 3 out 10 rating."
"pc95","5","2","3","30 August 2005"," Dynamic Visuals, so-so acting/directing/narration
","There's no denying the look of this film. It's been done before though in a similar vein with Dick Tracey and Sky-Captain - probably a superior look imo. Sky Captain was more of traditional movie and thus much more appealing. The stories are of course are graphic novelish - and not being a fan of that - the movie is pretty much just gratuitous comic-bookish violence with often average to poor acting - so to evaluate the movie is difficult because I didn't what it was made for. Narration is often flat too. However the visuals especially when motion is involved are competently put together and at times spectacular. Supporting gratuitous violence really doesn't give the movie anything to stand for, and so it's more of a so-so experience, maybe worth watching once unless you like gratuitous violence depicted."
"jlangbert","7","2","3","28 August 2005"," Dark City with a bit more humor
","I must admit to never having seen any of the material this movie was based on. Never the less, I'm going to guess that it was a challenge to transfer to the big screen. On the positive side, I watched this the whole way through, only checking my watch once or twice, which is a good sign. The characters are all pleasantly unpleasant, and the film noir storytelling makes it fairly easy to follow along. However, with several plot lines, I kind of expected a better wrap-up at the conclusion, but not all movies are completely understandable on first viewing, so maybe I missed something. The film is shot in black & white, with a few colorations, mostly red and mostly blood, which gets a bit hard on the eyes after an hour or so. Regardless, this is a good movie to rent if for no other reason than it is different from anything else you will have seen lately. But watch it after the kids have gone to sleep."
"superscal23","5","2","3","24 August 2005"," Visual style only carries this movie so far.
","Sin City is an interesting movie to watch because of it's visual style. It appears as if cinema has been brought to a comic book rather than the other way around. However, as with so many other recent movies, just because it's different and unlike anything that's been done before, that doesn't automatically mean it's a good movie!! The film revolves around 3 stories that have only a very loose connection to each other. About 90% of the characters in the film are confined to their story. Each story is mildly interesting and some entertaining stuff happens, but there isn't enough time or enough of a backstory to get involved in the characters lives and care about what's happening.<br/><br/>Some performances are good, some are not. The movie desperately wants to channel the same vibe as Kill Bill Volume 1, a film that celebrated spewing blood with such a brilliant comedic flare. Sin City wants to have that same energy and charisma, but fails. This film is violent and borderline hard to watch.<br/><br/>The movie is visually stunning to look at, and I imagine it looked fantastic on the big screen. However, as was the case with Pulp Fiction, Being John Malkovich, and Memento...different does not automatically mean good."

The way the scenes evolve and is overlapping is the same kind of way you see in Kill Bill.<br/><br/>Even though the action scenes is quite brutal they are rounded off in the perfect way.

Well here's your answer. The first actual comic book film in the way that it actually does an unbelievable job of combining film and art, not art like ""but is it art?"" talking drawings. An amazing portrayal of gender roles, women as in need or psychotic amazons, men as scumbags or noble scumbags. And let's not forget guest director's Quentin Tarantino's contribution which I will allude to but not reference directly to give you the challenge of picking it out yourself. Frank Miller's most successful foray into film (lets please forget Robocop 2 and 3) and Robert Rodriguez's opus. Groundbreaking, visually stunning, consistently good use of cgi, not over use like most Hollywood pictures today. Kick back, enjoy the holy hell out of it."
"Junta66","6","2","3","26 June 2005"," Glorified violence becomes glorious violence
","Yep, it's undeniably stylish, and surely it will be remembered, venerated for a while for its originality. But past the avant-garde beauty, of which the novelty does unfortunately wear off a few scenes into the film, there is not a lot to commend. You may be nodding appreciatively over the grey scale glamour of Sin City for two hours, in which case, great. On the other hand its veneer may stop amusing you once you've decided to start following the plot, in which case you're screwed for the remaining hour and a half. Sin City is wonderful in concept, every frame is eye-candy, but subject to a whole reel's worth of these frames the sweetness becomes a little sickly. The story serves mainly just to show off the capabilities of the camera, presenting itself as a series of anecdotal incidents that ultimately come to nothing. Had the film been shot in colour, it would be valueless, a minor blockbuster that showcases ultra-violence for cheap kicks, that gently stirs your appetite before the main course of the big summer blockbusters. It is the inspiration of designing this film to feel just like a comic that dignifies the plot and the shameless violence. In the name of art it feels perfectly natural to accept virile vengeance-seekers with a yen for castration and armies of gun-slinging prostitutes- you might even find yourself happily embracing all the action even if normally you'd make a point of looking decidedly disinterested to protect your dignity. Watch it and work out for yourself whether you like what the world is coming to."
"hohumdedum2","8","2","3","11 April 2005"," Good, but not great.
","Sin City is a very unique film, but there's certainly more style than substance here. Yes, it is like a comic book come to life, no doubt. The stories are interesting but I feel many people are blinded by the style of the film, which is total eye-candy. Mickey Rourke gives the best performance in the film, and his story is the most engaging involving a man who is out to avenge the death of a hooker whom was killed with him while he slept. The other stories were good, but lack the substance of Mickey Rourke's story. This film is certainly worth seeing in the theater, which was the main reason I ventured in. Do I think it is one of the greatest films of all time? No, and after years I'm sure it will lose it's luster. However, Sin City is an entertaining way to spend two hours, that's for sure."
"grendel-37","1","8","21","21 June 2005"," There is something, very... very... wrong here
","There is something, very... very... wrong here<br/><br/>Not specifically with the movie,though there is much wrong with that as well. No what disturbs me is this laudatory praise for a film, that even adjusting for varying degrees of taste, and standards, and mores... is by construction an empty, soulless movie.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, my issue isn't comics, or violence, or brutality or sex. My issue isn't with these things in a film, it's with these things in lieu of a film. <br/><br/>I have an issue with violence, and idiocy, misanthropy, and misogyny when these things fail to advance a story or a morality. It's the problem I have with Natural Born Killers, or Kill Bill, or... WWE wrestling or most reality television. <br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, I like good horror and action films as much as the next guy. But I ask of them to be films, to have a story, a plot, a moral center, a morality.<br/><br/>The negative, hateful aspects of our nature, the brutality, the hatred, the torture, the violence, when done for no other reason than to revel in these traits, is what I consider true pornography. I think films like this, as one excellent reviewer stated, are soft substitutes for snuff films.<br/><br/>I'm not a comic-book hater or snob, I know there are several people in the Comic medium... making riveting, admirable work. Names like Moore, Priest, Bendis, come to mind. And Frank Miller.<br/><br/>I'm a fan of Miller, but his work has never translated well to the big screen. His work, often uncredited, was the inspiration for most of the comic book movies of the last 20 years. And most of them are really, really bad.<br/><br/>And people are usually content to blame the director for making changes to the source. Here Rodriguez... to headoff any such comments, crams all the Sin City stories into one Miller inspired red, black and white screen sized comic book panel. A commendable idea that unfortunately fails horribly in the execution.<br/><br/>Here's a very brief outline of why:<br/><br/>-look, the look that has been praised for being garishly comic booky, is also its flaw. Page and screen are different mediums. What seems serious or haunting in one, comes off as campy and ludicrous in the other. Rourke's makeup, the band aids, the blood, the cheesy blown off limbs... it comes off as cheep and stupid.<br/><br/>-casting- casting name actors, stars, was a mistake, Because you're always distinctly aware it's rourke, and hauer, and willis, and madsen, play-acting these characters. There's no ""acting"" here. The film is really with few exceptions, full of poor, cartoony performances that left me bored out of my mind in the theater.<br/><br/>-structure- it was a mistake to make SinCity a melding of four different stories, rather than pick one book and flesh it out into a real story. <br/><br/>The reason is... Frank Miller repeats himself... a lot. <br/><br/>And the repetition that goes overlooked when there are months between these stories on the page, becomes glaringly obvious when followed one after the other on the big screen. Around the 3rd head in the toilet, or castration by gun riff, or Black evil henchmen slavish stereotype, and I was not only seriously bored, but also more than a little disappointed. <br/><br/>You begin to see Miller has some reoccurring issues going on here, and he really has not had anything new to say in the last 20 years, but keeps reworking his same old fetishes of big butts, big lips, toilet humor, and castration over and over again.<br/><br/>It came as something as a surprise to me, a Frank Miller fan, to realize just what a bloody hack he has become. <br/><br/>I wonder if looking at his work compressed... if it has become obvious to him as well.<br/><br/>A real director would have caught the failings of this structure, the repetition, the substitution of toilet humor, parody, and violence for anything resembling character. But like Miller himself, this film is directed by two others who have for the last few years simply been repeating themselves.<br/><br/>Rodriguez, who while competent at staging action scenes, is exceedingly incompetent at creating characters... situations, that we remotely care about. <br/><br/>And an action scene where you don't care if the character ducks a bullet or not, where there is no suspense, or fear or love for the character, is one of the most boring things in the world. Rodriguez has not made a good movie since his first one, and as his budgets have grown bigger he's grown equally better at crafting movies, filled with boring scenes... of action. Action drained of everything that makes it ... action. <br/><br/>Tarantino, off his equally bankrupt and boring Kill Bill series, has proved himself an equally flawed director. 2 once promising directors, 1 once great minimalist writer, add up to a film that is about noise over substance, laziness over character, and attitude over intellect. <br/><br/>In short they have given us a film for an age and a generation that no longer has any idea what quality is. A generation of monkeys who know neither beauty or brilliance, but simply flashing colors, loud noises, and broad photography of balls or breasts. And of course violence.<br/><br/>Violence. <br/><br/>This... WWE, Rush Limbaugh, Fear Factor, nightly news, bomb them all, Black men villains, Black women hors... generation knows violence. Maybe because it's all they're being shown these days.<br/><br/>Stereotypes.<br/><br/>You want to check out some good Comic Book inspired flicks try: <br/><br/>The first Crow First Two Superman movies 2nd Spiderman The first Punisher-with Dolph Lundgren, and Louis Gosett Jr. First Robocop 1st Matrix League of Extraordinary Gentlemen 1st Blade<br/><br/>Any of the above is better than SinCity, a film that ultimately has too many sins to recommend it."

","Has to be one of the greatest graphic novel adaptations ever made; cinematic yet faithful to the source and a crazy experience! Set up as four different stories (The Customer Is Always Right, The Hard Goodbye, The Big Fat Kill and That Yellow B******) all intermingling, its a masterpiece in gritty noir storytelling and the best use of voiceover you're ever likely to hear! It's hard to choose a favourite section as they blend seamlessly and it's really well crafted. The cast are fantastic; from the opening tinged with seductive romance starring Josh Hartnett and Marley Shelton, the document of a tired Sin City Cop who has one last mission to exact justice on starring Bruce Willis and Jessica Alba, the iconic Marv seeking retribution for his murdered lover starring Mickey Rourke and Jaime King, a man seeking revenge on a sadistic drunk starring Clive Owen, Benicio Del Toro and Rosario Dawson. That's just the beginning of the talent with great supporting roles all over too, particularly Elijah Wood and Devon Aoki as Deadly Little Miho! I think what makes this stand out also is that every character is fully rounded; it'd be easy for something like this to be all style over substance but it is lovingly made with a passion for telling the characters story while being a fast-paced piece of entertainment.It's full of action and is a beautifully unique visual experience; I think it may be Rodriguez's definitive masterpiece co-directed wonderfully with Sin City creator Frank Miller and featuring a delightfully blackly comic sequence directed by Quentin Tarantino! It's a must see for comic book and film fans alike"

The years passed by and I became a true cinephile and today I decided to give it a try after noticing the high rating and that Tarantino was a part of it and well, was one of the best decisions of my life! Cinematographically this is a masterpiece, a 10/10 on visuals with a perfect direction with amazing angles, shots, a beautiful photography, I loved the black and white tones and that only some things had real color, visually this is really perfect, it's like reading a comic book with your own eyes, they couldn't have done it better. Story wise I thought that I wouldn't like it due to the fact that I don't like action movies because most of them have awful plots with disproportionate action, but this has the right amount of everything. The right amount of action, the right amount of comedy and the 3 stories were pretty good and I loved every single one of them and the fact that they were 3 different actions and not only one. The movie keeps you one edge the old time and intrigued of what's coming next and it's hard to get bored watching this.

","For those who don't know what film noir is, it means dark film. It was one of the first genre's of film back when they were black and white. The murder mystery type. It's one of the first thing's that film students study in film school, if not the first. It set the stage for all of film back in the 20's and 30's. And since then has been lost, so that most people do not even know the phrase.<br/><br/>That genre has returned in all of its former glory and more here in this glorious masterpiece. Sin City is a serious work of art. It's new shades and textures of black and white with little splashes of color here and there are just beautiful and entrancing.<br/><br/>The movie is mysterious, inspiring, compelling, violent, shocking, romantic, poetic, glorious, and of course very dark. Robert Rodriguez is an incredible director who has done a lot of great action movies, but this work is revolutionary to say the least.<br/><br/>It comprises a set of 4 different sub stories within it, each which intersect in the middle and each which will keep you on the edge of your seat until the very end. Each one is an amazing story in and of itself that has a great beginning, middle and end. When you put them all together, what you get is just incredibly epic. So epic that it will literally blow your mind and make it hard for you to return to the real world after.<br/><br/>Of course it helps that this movie has one of the greatest line ups of all time in it. Each one of the stories within it has several huge actors in it, both stars and character actors. You will see all of your favorite actors in some of the most animated roles they have ever played. It is a such a treat.<br/><br/>This movie is like taking a powerful drug for any film students or connoisseurs or people who really love film. It is a really powerful experience I know you will enjoy. 10 stars easy."

","I went into this movie rather excited. I heard so much good things about this movie, but overall it thought this movie was incredibly dull and it couldn't quite grab me.<br/><br/>The style is the biggest selling point to the film, but I really didn't like it. It looked really fake, the background was obviously a green screen and it looked incredibly fake, I understand It's supposed to look like a graphic novel, but that doesn't mean it can transfer well to film, and it really doesn't. The CGI looks incredibly fake, and if the style wasn't like this, the film would still suck.<br/><br/>The lighting however is great, I love how everything is in black and white a part from certain colours, it really added a great effect to the movie and made it visually pleasing. But the greenscreen background and the crappy CGI really take away from the lighting.<br/><br/>The acting is also not that great. Bruce Willis was horrible at the beginning but none of the performances were overwhelmingly good, they were just decent. But the script doesn't really help. It's very much like graphic novel text, but that also doesn't transfer well to film. It's very clichÃ© and just sounds like a film studies script.<br/><br/>The action also really sucks. It look horrible. Not gory horrible, it just looks fake. When people get killed their facial expressions are laughable, and it just isn't exciting at all. So, boring script, not particularly good acting, bad style and it looks fake. Not great.<br/><br/>The narrative is also uneven, it focuses on three different stories and none of them are interesting, I care about no one in this movie. So I'm at a great disconnect from the film.<br/><br/>The cinematography is fine. Nothing particularly inventive or creative. But they use extreme close ups a lot and it looks incredibly cheesy. <br/><br/>Score is OK, nothing special. Works well with the action, but nothing particularly exciting.<br/><br/>So overall the film is a dull, un-interesting, stylistically bad graphic novel adaptation that feels more like a fan film than a feature film."

From this comment you can probably determine that I hadn't read the comics, 'cause Jesus... I mean I haven't seen such a constant stream of disturbing events since natural born killers (which in places has a similar visual style to this, although that might be something to do with the strange use of black and white and colour in both of them). There's murders, torture, body's with severed limbs, cannibals, corpses (and parts of), and overall extreme violence. I almost thought they over did the violence, I mean it's a film that I think a lot of people couldn't hack watching, and at times I had to look away. I think it might trouble me next time I'm stoned and in a dark alley! However, it is a bloody good film. The visuals are really interesting, and they get your attention and keep it throughout. It is generally exciting, keeps the pace up, and keeps a really militant Gothic feel that I haven't seen anywhere else before. It's got some fine women in it as well (although the fact they're killing people kind of detracts from their appeal). On the downside, the film tells the stories of 3 main characters, and they occasionally are seen in each others story, but there's no real correlation between the narratives. It doesn't draw them together properly in a pulp fiction type way or generate enough of a link between them, there just shown and then forgotten. I know that it was just displaying 3 of the characters in Sin City rather than trying to make some ""inexplicably linked"" style thing, but it still seemed too random and disjointed. The film really is flawed in many ways, and definitely not for the faint hearted, but overall it creates a really enthralling atmosphere and is entertaining to watch"

But if you are of one of those people that likes really bad movies and laughs just because a movie is THAT bad, then perhaps this movie is suited well for you.

The metaphors used in the movie were simply laughable. They overdrew my account by trying way too hard to pull me into the movie. Frank Miller is so in love with his own writing that it makes the narration and dialogue unbearable. The third turn off was the Robert Rodriguez weirdness.

The setting has no redeeming value and the action is as repetitive and monotonously disgusting as the three main actor's one dimensional performances.

Maybe Miller's books are a good read, I don't know but I hope he never makes another movie. I know its ""cool"" to get on board and say ""oh yeah, this movie is awesome"", but why? Tarantino hasn't made anything worth watching in 10 years, and Rodriguez has never made anything really worth watching. Willis and Rourke are washed up, and should stay off the big screen from now on. Clive Owen is alright, but you don't care what happens to anyone in this film. For a movie to include violence of this magnitude, you SHOULD care about the characters but here you just see people getting shot or sliced or arrowed and its just not entertaining one iota. Its time for movies to start having some substance. Haven't we seen enough CRAP to last a lifetime? The producers of this garbage should be liable for refunds at the theaters. I would definitely recommend taking some serious drugs before seeing this ""movie"". That way, you wont remember anything and thats a complete plus! ""Special Effects"" aren't special at all, just another boring excuse for a movie studio to spend a ton of money and come up empty once again. The ratings and grosses that ""Sin City"" are getting just goes to show us that unfortunately, people like garbage and don't mind getting ripped off. Well, I do mind getting ripped off and if you read this review and still go to see Sin City, you are a fool!"
"Juniorbandit","1","5","12","17 April 2005"," Not too hot
","This was one of the most overdone movies i have ever seen. It takes backseat only to the movie catwoman as the worst movie I have ever seen. In the first scene of the movie when i first heard the voice overs I thought it was kinda cool how they were really doing it like they would do a comic book. The coloring was superb but the bad acting and simply gore just tipped the scale for the worse. As much as I love Clive Owen, Benicio Del Toro, Jessica Alba, and Bruce Willis, I was extremely disappointed. Another strike against the movie was the acting, or lack thereof, from Elijah Wood, not only is he a bad actor to begin with (When i didn't here him talk that was a plus) but his part was awful, with his overdone smiles and stupid heads on the walls of his house. The excess of nudity (which I'm not complaining about in most things, I mean who doesn't want to see a stacked rack) was just too much and it took away from anything the movie might have had. As for the violence and torture, I'm all for it if it isn't over done. Let me rephrase because overdone is an understatement. The movie took the idea of gore and violence killed it, shot it hacked it up into tiny pieces and ran over with a car, but not before letting a dog eat the entrails of the corpse which is cinema. All in all out of the thousands of movies i have seen the bottom five include this, catwoman, gigli."

It reminded me of a gory video game where blood and guts are flying everywhere. Kind of like the old comic strip of ""Fearless Fosdick"" where the bullet holes were like a paper puncher and the holes didn't fill back up. Maybe I am just old-fashioned, but I sure hope these kinds of movies don't catch on in the future. The plot was clouded, it jumped all over and how many times can a man die? I don't mind fiction, but this is toooooo much. The only redeeming feature was the pretty ladies, even if they were very under-dressed. I am afraid I would have to give this one a rating of 1 star!"

","Had to watch it twice. I felt compelled, magnetized, mesmerized. Never happened to me before. I only watched it to cool off one of the hottest nights in a long summer - and got my nightmare without sleeping.<br/><br/>Is it technology? The movie is fully digital - and it shows in the amazing things it allows Rodriguez to do with dark Black and White and with colour details.<br/><br/>Or is it the stories? Told in a contorted series of intertwining situations, characters and places that uncover details of each character as you watch - not unlike Tarantino's own Pulp Fiction - the apprentice besting the master.<br/><br/>Or is it the action? Hyper-violent, over-the-top, splatter-prone, yet credible in its unfolding and never unwarranted.<br/><br/>Is it the actors? Many among them turning in memorable performances, sometimes their best ever, including a totally unrecognizable Mickey Rourke who meets the end he was promised in Angel Heart, with a great visual twist.<br/><br/>Or maybe the blood? It turns out White, Red and even Yellow streams, but it is unmistakeably it.<br/><br/>Or possibly the mixture of reality and (pulp) comic strip fiction? Indeed this does to noir cartoons what Pulp Fiction did to pulp fiction: a new cinema translation that will leave a mark on cinema stories and how they are told.<br/><br/>No. Of all the surprising features in the movie, I loved one most: an inordinate amount of extremely subtle yet all-encompassing movie quotations in the actual quotes, situations, setups, scenes, choice of actors in reference to their previous career roles, and, may I add, biographies. For example, take Rutger Hauer's rendering of Cardinal Roark's demise: isn't it a fantastic retribution for what he did as a replicant to his own creator in Blade Runner? This movie is a stunning mind-work of thousands of details merging into an epic story. Congratulations, Senor Rodriguez! What a sick imagination, Mr. Miller!"

","I loved the noir style, and visually the film is fantastic, groundbreaking, original, brilliant. The cast was top notch. Tough guys with a purpose, beautiful woman, often as tough as the men, and all seemed to play the character beautifully. However I didn't leave the theater thinking about how gorgeous the film was, but rather how violent. I understand Frank Millers graphic novels are very violent, and admire Rodriguez for staying true to the source, and I also don't particularly mind violence in movies. However I think if it was tuned down just a little it would've enhanced the film, rather then detract from it.

","There's some kind of credit at the beginning of the film for ""Special Guest Director: Quentin Tarantino."" I mean, like it's not enough that every geeky comic book freak in the universe is going to be in line at this film opening night, Rodriguez has to create a bona fide spoogefest by offering up Tarantino's name like he's the ""New Sucking Power"" on Rodriguez's spiffy vacuum.<br/><br/>I'm all for shameless female nudity in movies, but Rodriguez trots out his actresses sort of like boxing promoters trot out ring girls between rounds. Hey, look, Rodriguez got the mom from ""Spy Kids"" to be butt-ass naked in a film. Then, the hooker played by Rosario Dawson is wearing a see-through top over a skin-colored piece of spandex and we're left to ponder the wording in her contract. Jaime King is naked. Jessica Alba isn't. It's kind of like breast roulette.<br/><br/>""Sin City"" is not just an exercise in style over substance; it's a retread of a film that was itself a retread.

"teddeman","8","4","9","18 March 2005"," Sin City, the Blade Runner of comic book films.
","I just returned from the March 18, 2005 press screening of Sin City shown at the awesome Senator Theater in Baltimore, MD. Sin City will go down as the Blade Runner of comic book films. The film had an amazing feel to it and combined many visual styles to create a new filmic language. All the elements of a film noir action film were present: dimly lit scenes, monotone voice over narrative, and exquisitely placed one-liners.<br/><br/>I am not very familiar with comic book art, but the film used a bunch of familiar elements. Bad guys eyes were masked behind opaque glasses lenses and the scenes with characters driving looked like the comic cell where the car is speeding off into the distance. Limited splashes of color are used to accentuate key parts of the film or characters that will drive the rest of the story. The film is like nothing that has come before it and I am sure many will try to follow its lead.<br/><br/>The acting is great with no single character stealing the show. The makeup is amazing and even though the actors are often performing superhuman feats, the scenes do not poses any of the silliness of a film like The Hulk. Everything on the screen is believable because it is taking place in a comic book setting where anything is possible. Rodriguez crafts a world never before seen on film. He polishes it all off with a soundtrack is not at all intrusive and helps build the mood of the film.<br/><br/>Rodriguez stays true to his art form and except for a massive continuity flaw with blood on Mickey Rourke's chin and mouth appearing and disappearing, he keeps the film moving along seamlessly. Elements of past films have been placed through out the film. One pivotal scene begins at a loading dock that looks exactly like the one in the Matrix just before Cipher drops the cell phone in the trashcan. The wrap around storyline echoes Pulp Fiction beautifully. Rutger Hauer's scene looks like it could have come off the cutting room floor of Blade Runner. Rodriguez pays homage to those that came before him and provides us with numerous familiar visual elements.<br/><br/>Sin City will probably flop in theaters just because everything edgy and new generally does. Dennis Miller once appeared on the Ben Stiller Show and said, ""I love your show; you are doing cutting edge stuff. How long until it gets canceled like mine did?"" Sin City will have a massive cult following and influence many future films. Years from now it will get the recognition that its due. Rodriguez stays true to his beliefs and even resigned from the Director's Guild of America to make sure Frank Miller just credit as co-director. There should be more people like him in Hollywood. Sin City is far better than any Spider Man or Daredevil junk that has been produced in the past. Who knows, maybe people will even go rent Roadracers to see where that Rodriguez guy was coming from early in his career.<br/><br/>Catch Sin City in the theater as soon as possible, you won't be disappointed"
"StevePulaski","9","3","6","23 August 2014"," A graphic novel almost literally brought to life
","Frank Miller's, Robert Rodriguez's, and (sometimes) Quentin Tarantino's Sin City is the very definition of a graphic novel brought to life; a beautifully photographed, realized depiction of a smutty city, soaked in saturated black and white photography, with only sporadic primary colors blue, red, and yellow finding their way on screen in the occasion. A dark, moody crime thriller, easily publishable under the category of film noir (or even neo-noir, as it's known in its contemporary form), Sin City offers the viewer and immersing two hours in a seedy city known as Basin City, a fictional, crime-infested, and three of its shadiest characters.<br/><br/>The first is John Hartigan, an aging, veteran police officer played by Bruce Willis. In a town thriving on the self-fulfillment and gratification of others, Hartigan is selfless, always putting himself on the line for the greater good of Basin City's questionably deserving souls. We see Hartigan work to stop a serial killer who's victims have been children and is about to rape and kill fourth soul, as well as try to involve himself in more corruption that plagues Basin City.<br/><br/>The next character we see is Marv (Mickey Rourke), a physically undesirable but thoroughly interesting soul. Marv is about seven-foot tall, broodish, unattractive, and build like a werewolf in leather clothing. Scars litter his face and ice seems to run through his veins, substituting blood. Marv is hung up on a hooker he met named Goldie, who looked like the human descent of an angel, desirable, illuminating, and unbelievably lovely to him in every way. After she is murdered, he looks to avenge her death in the only way he - and the rest of Basin City - knows how, which is through uncompromising, brutal, and bloody violence.<br/><br/>Finally, there's Dwight (Clive Owen), who is caught in the middle of a vicious and abusive love-triangle between his current girlfriend Shellie (Brittany Murphy) and her physically-tormenting ex Jackie Boy (Benicio Del Toro). Despite being seeing Jackie armed with cronies and an arsenal full of tricks and manipulative tactics, Dwight fights to keep Shellie safe, as well as banding together a group of Basin City misfits, drifters, and prostitutes in order to form an uprising against Jackie Boy and his demeaning ways.<br/><br/>Basin City is far too diverse and populated to simply make a film focusing on one character for the full one-hundred and twenty-three minutes, so it's nice to see that writers Elizabeth Avellan, Miller, and Rodriguez make the film as fleshed out as possible in terms of the numbers of characters there are, yet still work to develop them all. Immediately, however, the film attracts and dazzles because of its visual scheme; an almost consistently black-and-white color palette, with other occasional colors sharing small parts of the screen (like red dresses, blood, a blue-eyed prostitute, and a venomous ""Yellow Bastard"") makes for a rich style that completely complements the original graphic novel of Miller's. Basin City is captured in a dark, muggy light, always caught in the middle of a light rainstorm/drizzle, and consistently finding ways to be simultaneously bleak yet wholly immersing. Never has a film in the 2000's look and bled (quite literally) like a film noir).<br/><br/>Sin City's only real misstep is that it occasionally becomes too kill-happy, focusing on the murderous rampages, excessive violence, and brutality and forgets either the characters behind them, or, predominately, the story, which can often be a muddle. While film noir movies are sometimes known for their unclear plots, Sin City does have a pretty clear one - mainly functioning as an anthology between characters - but its narrative richness could be more compelling had a foot been taking off the gas of the violence a few times. Yet this is not enough to derail the aesthetically sublime and, for the most part, well-acted display of neo-noir affects that work to create one of the most immersing films based solely on location that I've ever seen.<br/><br/>Starring: Bruce Willis, Mickey Rourke, Clive Owen, Benicio Del Toro, Jessica Alba, Brittany Murphy, Elijah Wood, and Powers Boothe. Directed by: Frank Miller, Robert Rodriguez, and Quentin Tarantino (sometimes)."

","The most amusing review of this movie i saw for Sin City described it as a masterpiece but warned viewers of excessive nudity. I think the reviewer was being serious though i suspect he must have been about 15 years old and i think that's probably the demographic that this movie is aimed at. Looking at the breakdown of voters on IMDb, the highest rating came from males under 18, the lowest from females over 45. There's no doubt that the visual style of the movie is brilliantly done. I just have a bit of a problem with Bruce Willis saving an 11 year old girl's virginity from a paedophile only to have him come back and finding her after 8 years during which she's been writing to him because she loves him. So its supposed to be OK now because she's 19? And wasn't he supposedly approaching 60 at the time he saved her? Ewhh...tacky. Yeah i know its meant to be a comic. So that means anything goes right? We can express all those subconscious desires we normally keep locked up in a closet somewhere. All the women are hookers and the good guys speak in dry one liners while performing various amputations on the bad guys. In my opinion some things are best left in the closet."

","Knowing literally nothing about the graphic novels by Frank Miller, I marveled at the glorious cast list on Sin City's IMDb page for so long before I finally saw the film. I used to check back every week just to see what hot new star they would add to the credits while it was in production. The only thing I did know was that a film starring Mickey Rourke, Michael Madsen and Rutger Hauer and that was being partially directed by Quentin Tarantino was going to be well worth checking out when it hit cinemas. Seeing the trailer later on, and the famous 'The Customer is Always Right' scene, the style took me by complete surprise and I realised this was not your run-of-the-mill crime thriller -- but something extra.<br/><br/>Sin City combines Blade Runner film noir with... nothing I've ever seen before! It can perhaps only be described as cartoon- or video game visuals, and it glazes this with a lush violence coating and stylish gore effects. This is crucial for the tough, gritty Basin City and its many plots that all depend on its dark style to function. There is not a whole lot beneath the surface if you scratch it, or rather there is but Sin City features so many story lines and characters that it simply has no time to explore all events and people in the plot, and it ends up feeling occasionally both shallow and rushed. It almost falls victim to the grievous cinematic sin.. 'style over substance' but it just about makes it, I think.<br/><br/>After a decade-long (or more) cinematic rut, Mickey Rourke is back in black as gasoline-chugging tobacco addict Marv and he plays this badass character superbly. The other actors do not disappoint either, but blend into their eccentric and freaky comic-book characters, creating an enjoyable mess--a freakshow. Alexis Bledel, Brittany Murhpy and Jessica Alba however, should never be allowed to work in films again because their acting actually wounds me. Although they drag Sin City down with their mere presence, this modern crime noir is still worth watching for its striking style. <br/><br/>8/10"

","Sin City was a unique little film. Perhaps it was a little too pointlessly violent and 'male power trip' for my tastes. However, the middle segment with Mickey Rourke as a superhuman, disfigured antihero is well worth the price of admission.<br/><br/>I'd have enjoyed the Yellow Bastard sequence, but I have too much respect for Nick Stahl (who plays Ben Hawkins in one my favorite TV series, Carnivale) to appreciate this singularly-minded cardboard baddie. And it's really just yucky, gross-out, pointlessly disturbing, and not in a Lynchian sort of way. The kiddies watching R movies in secret might get a kick out it, I suppose.<br/><br/>My general displeasure with Sin City - The Film is a bit disappointing to me, because I enjoy and respect Frank Miller's work. But this was just too single-minded, no real depth. Just raw, unadulterated violence and gross-out scenes to make the weak-kneed cringe. Great for teenage kicks, but I'm a little older now, and probably just a bit bored of stylized, pointless violence.<br/><br/>Oh well. Another dud for me, I'm afraid. But I did enjoy the middle bit, so I'm giving it 5 stars.<br/><br/>I will definitely praise the day when Frank Miller's Batman gets to play out on the big screen.

"OttoVonB","5","3","6","23 June 2006"," Wanting...
","In a city of freaks and villains, three related stories (of revenge, redemption and love) unfold. A grizzled detective (Willis) saves the angelic child he saved long ago (now stripper Jessica Alba) from a savage killer (Stahl). A monstrous hunk of a man (Rourke) searches for the psycho who killed his lover. A rogue (Owen) takes on a corrupt cop (Del Toro). Each of these stories features elements unique to Miller's world of grotesque crime.<br/><br/>Robert Rodriguez - not a director known for artistry of the intelligence of his output - opts for total fidelity to his source, in terms of story and visuals. Using deft combinations of masks and green-screen, he transposes Miller's palette of stark black and white, with the occasional color. This, though technically admirable, proves to be the source of the film's downfall.<br/><br/>Visually, it comes across as nifty rather than great, mostly because the potential is never fully realized: a light posterization would have rendered things less jarring and more otherworldly, whereas here we have to deal with often painful to look at impossible light games. Artistically, the film comes across as irrelevant since it neither adds to Miller's world nor does it even vaguely complete with his original panels (movement, cinema's advantage over still pictures, is only once put to effective use: during a car crash.).<br/><br/>In terms of story, we are very much in the comic world, but while quite inventive in its own right, the story is let down by its delivery. These lines do not work in a 3D environment. And the all-too-real elements make many scenes feel odd and uncomfortable rather than part of a coherent universe. Rodriguez also unfortunately opens his film with the strongest of the three stories (Rourke's) and ends with the weakest (the Willis/Alba tale).<br/><br/>In terms of performance, the only thing to write home about (though with honorable mention) is the charismatic and obsessive work of Mickey Rourke. The rest of Rodriguez's impressive cast fails to register.<br/><br/>The main problem in Sin City might not even be in the concept or in the cast (as Rourke proves on his own), but in Rodriguez's complete submission to Miller's rules. The greatest proof is the film's only truly inventive and enjoyable scene, directed by Quentin Tarantino. Truth be told, it sticks out like a sore thumb, the only one that marks a slight departure from the comic, making full use of the cinematic medium. This gives one a taste of what a real director might have done with Miller's creation. In general the film is also surprisingly uninspired story-wise, mainly driven by a succession of pretty pointless violence that carries no purpose, no subtext, and no emotional impact since  with only one possible exception  we care not one iota about these characters.<br/><br/>That ""Sin City"" managed to reach such popularity (even, at present, having settled in the higher end of IMDb's top 100) is a tribute to the greatness of Miller's comic. That does not detract from the fact that this is a poor, pointless and infuriatingly stale film adaptation."

","There is Spiderman, Superman, the Punisher, Wonderwoman, Batman and many other comic book adaptations floating around since as early as the seventies. Most of these were loosely translated onto film, maintaining the main character and a love interest or two. Frank Miller's Sin City is without a doubt the greatest adaptation of them all.<br/><br/>Using unique camera techniques and dialogue directly out of the graphic novels it is no wonder that this ranks #60 on IMDb's top 250. With ingenious choreography and different yet intertwining stories taking us through Basin City this movie is spectacular and incomparable to any others like it...expect for the fact that there are no others like it.<br/><br/>The acting is top notch, especially that of Clive Owen (Dwight), Bruce Willis (Hartigan) and who could possibly forget Mickey Rourke in arguably his best role as Marv. This is a must see for older audiences who will not shy away from graphic violence and some admittedly gratuitous nudity scenes.<br/><br/>I score this a 10/10 and am eagerly anticipating the sequel!"
"Mr_PCM","10","3","6","28 February 2006"," Innovative, original, gripping, unique
","Too many films are described as unique or groundbreaking in some way. However when it comes to Sin City, those platitudes are well and truly deserved.<br/><br/>Sin City is a vile corrupt cesspit of a town, where no one is innocent, even the good guys are bad, and the bad guys are truly evil. The film is made up of three distinct original stories based on Miller's novels, all cleverly interwoven, and narrated by each story's main character. This adds to the real adult comic book feel to the film. Shot almost entirely in black and white, with sporadic splashes of colour, the film is beautiful to look at, managing to capture the essence and feel of a classic 50s noir while also looking modern, thanks to being shot almost entirely on green screen. The girls and the cars are absolutely beautiful, and the guys are always anti-heroes, vigilantes or downright sick or evil.<br/><br/>The scenes are almost frame for frame recreations of the original graphic novel source material of Frank Miller, and the characters really look their comic-book equivalents. The dialogue is superbly written, with an almost poetic quality, and all in all is extremely faithful to Miller's original work. The three stories themselves are all uber-violent and gritty tales of revenge, honour and justice (although the sentiments often prove somewhat misguided or self-defeating), and no one is entirely innocent  with the exception of Nancy, played to angelic perfection by the beautiful Jessica Alba.<br/><br/>A superb cast make up Sin City, where virtually every single face is a recognisable one. However, the undoubted star of the piece is Mickey Rourke, who is a revelation in his comeback performance as Marv. Somehow he manages to make a manic psychopath driven by a need for revenge seem like a hero, if only because the guys he is killing are even worse than he is. Elijah Wood too is superbly creepy as the mute cannibal Kevin, and it shows how hard he is working not to find himself typecast as a hobbit. Bruce Willis, Rosario Dawson, Benicio Del Toro and Clive Owen, amongst others, are all also excellent, making Sin City a truly brilliant all-round ensemble piece. However it is not for the squeamish or faint-hearted, as the claret (and limbs) flows freely and frequently.<br/><br/>The only quibbles are that the superb instrumental guitar riff which appears on the film's trailers and menu does not appear on the film soundtrack itself, and that the sequel is not due until late 2007! A truly brilliant film, probably the best film of 2005, (a year which also saw the release of Batman Begins and Star Wars) and a gripping comic book tale of corruption and justice, filmed in a truly unique and innovative way. A work of art, and a film that must be seen by any true movie fan. Sin City is simply a cool movie."

There are 3 different stories and all three of the main characters end up at this same strip joint but they don't know each other.<br/><br/>It was violent but not realistic. You have a few red splatters of blood. People get knifed, have their throat slashed, and even beheaded. And the guy that gets beheaded won't die. He's got something in his head but won't die. Then his face still moves after he's beheaded. It was just too silly.<br/><br/>And the gun toting prostitutes were silly. All they were there for is to prance around in skimpy outfits.

Two things that everybody said about the movie were true:<br/><br/>A) It is a visual gut fest and about the best comic adaption ever B) It is probably the most violent mainstream movie ever<br/><br/>A) is the sole reason why I still gave this movie 5 out of ten stars. They way everything is visualized is just perfect for a comic adaption and I do not know a single example that is getting close to Sin City regarding this! You can clearly see that they had real actors and real stages, on the other hand you can clearly see that it is a comic! It's hard to describe and I won't try to describe, one has to see it. <br/><br/>But that's about it. I don't mind violence in movies but in this case they exaggerated, SIN City or not. During the movie I always wondered how Sin City can keep up it's population ... by the end of the movie the city must be empty! You have several story lines plotted together and it works kind of well for the part with Bruce Willis, but in general you had the feeling that there just ISN'T any story, just some excuses to show more violence. There was no pause, almost no silent moments and the characters had nothing human left. Yeah, I know, it's Sin City and it's human to behave bad, but I think if those characters had some weak spots and some good attitudes, just *some*, everything would be more believable and the violence and bad behavior would have been more dramatical. But as it is, all I see is one crime after another, without any sense. the first 30 minutes were okay because of the visual effects but after an hour I had only one question ""When will this have an end!?"".<br/><br/>Note: I have never read the comics, so crucify me. But one of my friends did and he said the same about the movie. He liked the comics but the movie is exaggerated and has a lesser plot."

","Maybe I expected too much from this film, it was a bit too ""unreal"" in parts (like Marv being run over repeatedly and him being turned over a leaf. or when someone gets murdered yellow blood appears all over the place), maybe Quentin Tarantino could have done a better job (ie Kill Bill Series)<br/><br/>On the other side of the coin good acting performances from a heavy duty cast keep the standards up...Bruce Willis, Michael Madsen and Mickey Rourke stand out plus supporting roles from other actors (Rutger Hauer, Powers Booth, Jessica Alba amongst others)...the use of primary colours in contrasting with the black and white are very vivid..<br/><br/>The plot is constructed in a similar vein to CRASH, GO, PULP FICTION where differing people and situations are interlinked..<br/><br/>Overall this film is a definite watch, but should have been better."

","I have never read a comic book in my life, let alone the Sin City ones. Which is probably why I thought this highly-regarded film was actually a load of nonsense (- apart from the outstanding cinematography, which is mind-blowing, and clearly took a lot of effort to pull off flawlessly.) Rated purely from an entertainment point of view, I have to say the plot - or plots rather - are weak and badly scripted, most of the characters have no depth at all (with the exception of Willis & Alba), and I spent the whole movie waiting for a climax or twist that brought together all the plots, but there wasn't one. It just ended, after a lot of senseless violence. 4/10, plus another 2 for the cinematography and Jessica Alba, who is the hottest woman on earth."

","Wow, it's in the top 250 films of all time. This is the perfect picture for 2005, all style and absolutely NO substance. None, nada, empty.<br/><br/>I'm not complaining about the violence (Kill Bill rules,) in fact I thought the violence was pretty muted. I'm certainly not an anti-comic-book person; Dark Knight by Mr Miller is my favourite comic book ever. This is just a pointless film.<br/><br/>It looks fabulous but after 30 minutes that just gets tiring. I'm not expecting Citizen Kane, just at least an attempt to inject some kind of plot to hold the whole thing together. It would have made a great short film but over two hours it is just boring, and the dialogue is just plain ridiculous. Driving this point home is Bruce Willis, he has nothing more to do than to be Bruce Willis. What more need be said? It's a pity really, I was very much looking forward to this but in the end it left me feeling robbed."
"bob-rutzel","7","3","6","18 August 2005"," Good, Bad and Ugly
","Four slices of life: Detective Hartigan(Willis) saves a young girl from a pedophile; tough guy, Marv (Rourke) is framed for a murder of the prostitute he was just with; Dwight (Owen) helps the sisterhood retain control of Sin City; and Hartigan again meets the young girl he saved years ago.<br/><br/>The Good: this is like looking at a comic book (from which the stories are derived) come to life, literally come to life. I mean every scene looks like a panel in a comic book that springs to life. And, this is awesome. Almost like magic. The action is what we see in our mind's eye when we read comics. It literally comes to life as we read on. Isn't that what a comic book panel is supposed to do? Well, it does it perfectly in this movie. The special effects are stunning and I have never seen anything like them. Most of the movie is in black and white with color thrown in at certain times. The acting also is good, but the cinematography and special effects win here.<br/><br/>The Bad: I would have enjoyed this even more if the stories weren't as violent as they were. I saw no purpose in the overkill (the only word for it) when people were being maimed, tortured, thrown here and there, and then killed. In a comic book panel it probably doesn't have the same negative impact because we go quickly to the next panel (well, most of us do), but here the comic book panel comes to life and we can't go on until the director wants us to move on. So we stay and watch something almost real happening. Repeat: almost real. Overkill because it continues (when it should stop) and stays there when you think it should be over. Yes, I had the FF Button at the ready, but I wanted to see how long the butchery would last. It lasted too long. No purpose served here except to titillate. Much too violent.<br/><br/>The Ugly: We see hands and legs sliced off, bodies still alive being eaten by wolves and body parts being yanked off and jettisoned every which way. It got to be a bit much. Truly Ugly. We need this? <br/><br/>Hartigan, Marv and Dwight are ordinary people until someone tries to kill them. Then you would think they were Clark Kent aka Superman. They are hard to kill or stop and they keep coming back when you know they don't have any more breath in them to continue. I ran out of breath just watching. But continue they do. Somehow, they find their second, third, fourth etc winds and continue to fight and try not to be taken out or killed.<br/><br/>If you thought there was too much violence in Pulp Fiction or Natural Born Killers, you have a big surprise waiting for you with this one. The cinematography and special effects are outstanding and you could say that it is a true work of art, but the violence is really too much. And, that brings it down for entertainment value. This is definitely not for kids......some adults too."

","Looks great but the content is obnoxious, adolescent and so monotonous (literally) that any potential entertainment value is strictly limited.Maybe the boys who made it had a good time but forgot to include anyone else. <br/><br/>It's sort of ""Kill Bill meets Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow"" but snappy it 'aint and the plot seems to go around in circles and repeat itself to no good purpose.<br/><br/>At the screening I attended (and the one before - I got there early) people left, possibly offended by the endless violence which seemed to have little or no point."
"Quinoa1984","8","3","6","7 August 2005"," not quite going along with the pack of others- I recommend Sin City, but...
","...I think that maybe I have seen too many movies in this vein and style, or I have been privy to too much in the realm of dark, violent, and intriguing noir stories, but there's just something about Sin City that doesn't quite make it a masterpiece, at least for me. I wouldn't dare tell you to not see the film, especially if you're in its target area (if you look at the IMDb votes, the primary 10's are given by those under the age of 18, or 18-29, mostly males), and for auteur Robert Rodgriguez (his number of credits practically solidifies him as one), he has here achieved a different style that stands out pretty well in today's muck of Hollywood films. What can be criticized, I think, is with Frank Miller, who is more of the brain, brawn's, and flaws of Sin City as writer/co-director of the film, and originator of the comic books this film is practically copied and pasted by. <br/><br/>I have read a couple of the Sin City comics, and I have no doubt that Miller is a gifted artist. But as a storyteller, he's hit or miss for me. Not that I am unaware of what goes into these noir stories- there's the consummate anti-heroes (haunted cops, big tough guys with a heart), the strong femme fatales, and the twisted, corrupt villains. Yet even in the best parts of Sin City there's something, well, too expectable. Not to say the actors don't do what they can or there's not enough juice in it. But at times I felt Rodriguez, through Miller, was so faithful to the original text (he called it a 'translation' as opposed to an adaptation), some of the real interesting parts were left behind. There is something in Rodriguez/Miller that speaks of talent and strength, but also total dependence on standards in the genre(s).<br/><br/>There is no question that the content in the film is rather graphic and surreal in the violence (the ripping off of various body-parts, blood sometimes red or b&w or yellow), and on the visceral level I mentioned it serves the brutality of the stories. Take Elijah Wood's character, Kevin, whom he plays with perfect stone-cold, calm insanity. He is likely the most violent character in the film (Marv is violent, though mostly by defense), even if we don't see him committing these violent acts. Scenes involving him and Marv (Mickey Rourke, also one of the highlights of the film) are well shot, but somehow I felt a kind of by-the-numbers quality as well. It's strange to say it, and many will not feel the same way (many have commented on the film's brazen originality, which I do and don't see), there is something about the film that tries so much (and maybe too hard) to be easily liked.<br/><br/>Rodriguez, in keeping with a very similar storytelling style of his friend Quentin Tarantino, is confident, but because it's a familiar style, it doesn't make the last segment- That Yellow Bastard- as exciting/unpredictable as it might have been as the last segment. The Big Fat Kill, which Clive Owen and Benicio Del-Toro's characters (I preferred the later's performance, Owen in his one-tone voice isn't as effective as Del-Toro) should have been last and made for a more effective ending. The story itself involves strippers, a bad-ass cop (Jackie-Boy, Del-Toro) who barks up the wrong tree, a scary hoodlum (Michael Clarke Duncan), and a possible gang war. This segment includes some of the better parts of the film, however overall feels like the weakest. There's more interest in the core of Marv and Hartigan (Bruce Willis, also good) in their stories, but with the Big Fat Kill there are, like in the other parts, flashes of genius without a distinct direction.<br/><br/>It's not to say that Rodriguez doesn't have his strengths as a filmmaker, but one can sense when the style shifts in Tarantino's directed segment. Throughout the film, Rodriguez and Miller test with the possibilities of different colors amid the black and white texture used in the completely digital backdrop. Aside from the Yellow Bastard (Nick Stahl, not quite as terrifying as Wood's Kevin), the usage of different colors isn't as fulfilling as one might expect. Except in the Tarantino scene; it reminded me of a cross between a crazy scene in an Italian horror film (Del-Toro being a zombie in Owen's head space) while including a color layout of an art film that was unique. This is one of the best scenes in the film, and something about Tarantino's direction- even within the confines of Miller's writing- rises a little above (some of) Rodriguez's work.<br/><br/>I've realized more on the subsequent repeat viewings- which do reveal there's more to take in than at first is apparent- that Sin City is, more often than not, a good success of style over substance- the film should've received an Oscar nomination for visual effects, and even cinematography, as it is of a highly professional quality. Rodriguez and Miller, in being so in love with the technology and look of the film at their disposal, at times miss what possibilities are in the actors, what they can do with the story. Aside from some exceptions, the performances in the film are less than great, trying to sound too much like how one would picture it. The difference between a modern film-noir like Pulp Fiction and a modern film-noir like Sin City isn't necessarily with the story, but how real the actors get with the characters. 'Pulp' does that, while Sin City doesn't as much, at least to me. It's got a lot of skill and juice, at times excellent, but there's something missing in it. A-"

","I went to see this with a 61 year old female friend. She eventually had to avert her eyes and we left after about 45 minutes! I myself could deal with the more-or-less pornographic violence, but really nothing prepares the viewer for it. Viewers who are connoisseurs of Frank Miller's work will appreciate the movie best, and it must seem heaven-sent where they are concerned. Perhaps they find the grotesque violence--which is entirely gratuitous--somehow satisfying? However I believe that from an objective point of view that the various stories are pointless and don't really go anywhere. What is this movie telling us? That serious corruption exists in the world? We know that already, but in fact this movie parodies the real evils of the world and makes them seem un-real and cartoonish to the degree that a naive viewer might dismiss the problem of evil as being entirely imaginary. The closest any of the male characters come to showing any virtue is when they seek revenge, which is not a virtue at all, nor is it manly. I am dismayed to see that this movie has made it into the Top 250. It is not a great movie, it is merely different. The style is so different that it is refreshing, but in the end it is just a sugar-rush, and most viewers will quickly tire of it, I hope."

"Eumenides_0","6","3","6","1 July 2005"," Modern Noir Masterpiece
","'Sin City' is the most enjoyable movie I have seen so far this year, whether on DVD or at the theater. Roberto Rodriguez and Frank Miller have made one of the most entertaining and emotionally satisfying movies of modern times. The story is told with raw intensity from the beginning to the end, constantly surprising the viewer with the next fantastic, unpredictable twist and conclusion. It's a movie told in mosaics, three distinct stories with their own protagonists and antagonists, beginning, middle and end, and with some marginal connection. In the end, though, it's almost always the same story: the lone tough guy on his personal crusade for love against the powers that be. Miller seems to love a specific type of male character  they always come as streetwise, macho, violent men with their emotions on their sleeves and inflexible, twisted morals, capable of doing anything for a dame. The women came in as more diversified, but they're still pretty much the archetypal femme fatale from noir tradition. If this looks like Miller can't come up with different characters or that he is merely repeating himself, that's not my point. In fact, Marv, Hartigan and Dwight are three of the most distinct, fascinating characters I've seen in a good while. They're all born from the same basic source of creativity  namely noir tradition that Miller so much loves  but each story is different and unique on its own! <br/><br/>The story that more impressed was Marv's segment. Mickey Rourke, in one of his finest roles ever, gives life to a violent, brutish and uncompromising tough guy bent on revenge. Marv is a walking anachronism, his raw brutality, frankness and values are completely incompatible with modern society  and I think he acknowledges that at the end of his segment. When the only woman of his life is mysteriously killed, Marv turns Sin City upside down looking for the killers until he reaches the core of power and corruption controlling the city. The resolution is unpredictable but also the most realistic. Miller and Rodriguez didn't cop out here, and I praise them for their courage. This story is the most violent of the three, pretty much on account of Marv's presence, and also has the most colorful characters of the movie  Wendy and Goldie, Cardinal Roark, the psychotic cannibal Kevin. Elijah Wood was unrecognizable as a young killing machine that devours his victims. As corny as this may seem, the truth is Miller and Rodriguez makes it work with chilling beauty! <br/><br/>The second segment was my least favorite; it was still enjoyable and had some of the best acting of the movie thanks to Benicio Del Toro's performance as Jackie Boy: his scenes with Clive Owen inside the car were so funny! Owen is good as Dwight, as regular and nice guy as Sin City could allow it: like Marv he gets in trouble for women, only this time he's fighting to keep someone he loves alive. It's a twisted story featuring a colorful gallery of characters, from a scantily-dressed army of dangerous prostitutes to Irish mercenaries, to Manute, it's a fun ride full of ecstatic violence and action: the final showdown on the rooftops of Old Town Still was impressive, but it still left me emotionally cold.<br/><br/>Now the last segment  the 2nd best to me  was the most emotional and heartbreaking of the movie! Bruce Willis gives the best performance of the movie as John Hartigan, a rare thing in Sin City: a decent, hard-working cop who fights corruption and the powers that control Sin City, namely Senator Roark and his son, Junior. This is to me the most complex story of the three: Hartigan saves a young Nancy Callahan from child rapist and serial killer junior when she's only 11 years old. Hartigan knows he's getting in trouble going against the Roark, but for him saving a young girl in exchange for his life is a fair trade. He saves her, but what comes next is the most twisted revenge story ever! Senator Roark makes sure Hartigan is charged with raping Nancy and he goes in for eight years. Everyone abandons him, his friends and family, thinking he's a sick pervert. He accepts it all very well: telling anyone the truth would imply their deaths. So he takes his punishment in silence. Now one of my favorite scenes in the movie is when young Nancy visits Hartigan at the hospital to thank him; she knows he's being framed and is powerless to help him, and Hartigan tells her to never see him again. Their only contact during eight years becomes the letters she sends him every week. But when the letters stop coming, Hartigan knows something's wrong and takes action. What follows is one of the most satisfying stories I've seen in a while as Hartigan gets his revenge, but it's also the most depressing as his inflexible values force him to do something extreme to save Nancy Callahan, now 19 years old, from Roark's wrath. The ending is just heartbreaking and yet it's the only possible conclusion.<br/><br/>Accompanying the three stories is the always superb cinematography: mostly black-&-white, sometimes with some bits of color to make contrast, and always visually impressive. The score is memorable and the dialog is Oscar-worthy! The acting is not always great, but the characters are so strong one forgives that.<br/><br/>Putting it simply, Miller and Rodriguez have created a modern masterpiece!"

","""Sin City"" finally proves that it is possible to make an entire living breathing movie through green screen and do it properly (as opposed to ""Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow"") - it's ""Dick Tracy"" without the ego, it's Robert Rodriguez finally fully atoning for ""From Dusk Till Dawn,"" it's... I'm gushing, aren't I? In keeping with this comic book/graphic novel/whatever adaptation's title, let's tie this in with the Seven Deadly Sins.<br/><br/>PRIDE: The characters in each story have their share of it - they may not be too proud of what they are, but they'll be damned if they'll let it drag them down into the morass. Marv, Dwight and Hartigan can all stand tall (or they would were it not for Dwight being the only one not dead by the end of the movie), and the female characters similarly won't let anyone push them around; even the sweet Nancy doesn't give That Yellow Bastard the satisfaction of screaming when he whips her brutally. Not a wimp in the bunch (well, maybe Becky).<br/><br/>ANGER: You bet. Marv's quest for vengeance for the dead Goldie; the Old Town Girls defending their turf; Hartigan not letting anyone hurt the little girl/grown woman he loves... there's fury all through this trip through Basin City. It's part of what fuels these characters, along with good old-fashioned love. Anger is also what may result from a few of the performances, but only a few (Michael Madsen is pretty one-note, even in this milieu, and Clive Owen's US accent is a bit dodgy, but otherwise the cast - Willis, Rourke, Boothe, Wood, even little parts like Michael Clarke Duncan and Josh Hartnett - is terrific all round.)<br/><br/>ENVY: This is more of an audience thing; viewers envying all the testosterone-dripping but yet still sensitive (in a way) men with hardware at the ready and macho voiceovers to spare, not to mention a city with no ugly women anywhere in sight. (""Sin City"" is not exactly a chick flick, making Alexis Bledel the performer with the most diametrically opposed movies this summer - see also ""The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants."") <br/><br/>LUST: With all due respect to female fans of Clive Owen and Benicio Del Toro, this is very much one for the men. Carla Gugino wearing nothing but a thong. Barmaid Brittany Murphy (the only cast member to appear in all three stories). Rosario Dawson as the leader of the Old Town Girls. Jaime King, Alexis Bledel and especially silent but deadly Devon Aoki as three of said prostitutes. The olive-skinned, almond-eyed, lush-lipped, sensuous gift to straight men everywhere that is Jessica Alba. All stunners, and all, as Marv puts it, ""worth killing for, worth dying for, worth going to hell for. Amen."" <br/><br/>COVETOUSNESS: George Lucas only wishes he could manage actors as well as this - Rodriguez and Frank Miller make the technology serve the movie, not the other way around.<br/><br/>GREED: You may well want more of the stylized look of Basin City, the black-and-white with splashes of colour (the eyes always stay in colour), the dazzling ultra-violence... this truly is poetry in motion. Gruesome? You bet (Marv literally leaving a villain for the wolves, Miho slicing villains left and right, Hartigan getting shot several million times - not to mention what he does to TYB), but if you can take it, you'll want more, more, more.<br/><br/>SLOTH: Well, the stories may be pretty slim, especially the final one (a bit lazy in that respect), but in this world it's not what's told so much as the way it's told. And the way it's told is mind-blowing... ""Sin City"" may not be for everyone, but from the moment Rodriguez's sax music kicks in (he also did the score for the last story, with Graeme Revell mainly handling the first, and John Debney the second) it's a trip very, very worth taking. Sequel, please. (And bring back Jessica; after That Dress at the MTV Movie Awards...)"

","Every year we're lucky enough have a fresh comic book adaptation forced down our throats like one of Buffalo Bill's chrysalises but here's something a bit different - a comic book adaptation of a movie. Sin City is a paper to celluloid transfer for Frank Miller's bleak Film Noir pastiche, now itself a Noir but one with a level of stylisation unprecedented in the genre. Rodrigeuz and Miller have fashioned a movie in which every shot is a meticulous recreation of the source graphic novels. The ontology of these shots even mirror the books because it's all been painted in using computer graphics. The plot, three stories set in a metropolis of human filth and brutality is pitched, as you might expect in the event of having the author as Co-director and screenwriter, perfectly in a recreative style that renders the men as aggressive, nihilistic, tortured characters loyal only to themselves and their own moral code and women as objects of lust - sexual objects through and through. Fans of Film Noir should love it frankly - it's all moody streets lit in shadow (though not really of course), voice-over narration, murky criminality and femme fatales. The misogyny will be unpalatable for some but that's the genre kids, this isn't a documentary and such criticism has no place in this kind of movie. The male oriented approach that the material demands allows for a great deal of violence which I enjoyed enormously. On the subject of the women incidentally, they're as gorgeous as the men are aggressive and Lucille's breasts in particular deserve to be awarded a couple of Oscars in-addition to the striking visual effects which mix beautifully toned chiaroscuro virtual sets with some striking and clever use of colour. If there's any criticism to be had its that the film's strength, its rigidly faithful recreation of the source material could also be construed as its weakness. For all its energy and vivid visuals it lacks depth, inevitable when your characters are direct recreations of comic book characters. They're types rather than fully three dimensional human beings and so lack the humanity of the heroes or rather antiheroes that populated the great Noirs of the 40's. Sin City also has the occasional slow moment and some moments of humour that feel like false notes in an otherwise watertight production. Not perfect then but when you consider that this is the first movie since Beaty's Dick Tracy (1990) that has successfully presented itself as a living comic book and goes further than that film ever could, its something of a new sub-genre and if the sequels are crafted with the same care and attention to detail as this film then we should be in for a bit of a treat - the visual equivalent of a giant slab of chocolate cake. It's a bit too insubstantial for my taste but I can't say I didn't enjoy visiting Sin City and its lavishly created world."

","The general vibe about this film was very good, so I was really looking forward to seeing it. The first thing to say about the film is that it looks fantastic. I believe that several of the scenes were shot with the actors at different times with some of them not even meeting. Anyone that excuses some of the acting/direction of the Star Wars prequels due to difficulties in blue screen is clearly shown that this can work.<br/><br/>The opening sequence with Bruce Willis is very good. The dialogue throughout has some high points and the acting is generally very good. All the components are in place for a fantastic movie, but unfortunately the film doesn't engage the audience. The film is very violent, but it's of the Tom and Jerry variety and therefore I wouldn't say the film is particularly shocking. Overall it's well worth seeing at the cinema for the look, but probably isn't one for repeated viewings."

","Films, novels, and comic books (and everything in between) share one thing in common  they have to sell the world they exist within or else they will not succeed. The audience has to accept the rules and conditions of the said film/novel/comic book before they can get into it and truly like it. I have trouble getting into the world of comic books usually because I don't really care to accept their world and go with it; I'd rather do other things.<br/><br/>However, I loved the world Frank Miller inked for Sin City.<br/><br/>I loved how far over the top Sin City dared to go  utterly ridiculous and far-fetched that it almost begs critics to trash its silliness  I can't think of many films that match the sheer outrageousness of Sin City. A sense of outrageousness that has earned lesser films a razzie or two (or twenty). However, Sin City executes the impossible with such lighthearted expressionistic grace . . . a dark, twisted, perverted version of lighthearted that gets a hard-R rating for violence and nudity, but lighthearted none-the-less.<br/><br/>This is the world of Sin City, presented with no apologies, justification, nothing. Either take it or get lost.<br/><br/>I found it particularly intriguing how some of my usual complaints and biases towards comic-books didn't pop into my mind. Usually when characters die and come back to life, or refuse to die when they should, I wind up sighing, shaking my head, and thinking how much it reminds me of a certain overrated slasher franchise. Sin City commits these same crimes, and my response was along the lines of, ""Yeah Marv! Rock on!"" <br/><br/>Also, the film's structure sat surprising well with me. Usually following three (technically four) sets of characters through different episodal-style narratives yields shallower characters in a story that might as well be whimsical, or to be perfectly frank (no pun) it spells death. However, Miller, Rodriguez, and the film's entire cast managed to convince me that more went on in these characters lives  that the camera only follows them around briefly  and in a sense develop the characters without developing them (read: without regurgitating pages of boring back story no one cares about anyway). I was eager to hop into each new story and ride with each set of characters through their own individual adventure. Especially Marv . . . I liked all the stories and characters, but Marv (played brilliantly by Mickey Rourke) was the man.<br/><br/>The visual style of Sin City is a sight to behold, and a landmark for Comic-book adaptations. I adore the look of Sin City  how in this world the laws of physics are exaggerated, key colors show through, how the weather obeys the right cues as the camera glides gracefully and naturally into position to capture that film noir graphic novel vibe. The cinematography, lighting, the cityscapes - they're all characters in Sin City, and prominent characters at that.<br/><br/>In closing, I find Sin City most amazing in that it has dozens of elements that have made me loath other films through the years  I never thought I'd see excessive nudity, excessive violence, overabundance of CG, divided narrative style, and 'silly' comic book characters all in the same film, and I never dreamt I would like that film.<br/><br/>But I did."

","This could've been a great one. The look and feel of the film - though over-hyped (everyone jumped on the ""what an incredible look!"" bandwagon) - was dark and nihilistic, the acting was reasonable, (except for Mickey Rourke - who was _terrific_) and the plot line was quite inventive.<br/><br/>However...<br/><br/>I'm no prude (loving films from Midnight Cowboy to Pulp Fiction), but what have we become when we need that kind of violence and sex to make an impact? Are we really at the point where we say, ""If we CAN depict it, then we MUST depict it""? Looking around the theater, one could see all the young white males after whose dollars, we are continually told, the entertainment world lusts. Only some of those males had girl friends or wives loyal enough to accompany them. And what were those loyal women treated to? Some pretty unnecessary and demeaning images.<br/><br/>""But that's Sin City!"" you say. Yeah, well...

","Sin City is a nauseatingly unpleasant place to visit.<br/><br/>On the good side, it's got an incredible visual style. Director Robert Rodriguez outdoes the wild visuals and CGI advancements of his Spy Kids series.<br/><br/>But the problem is the film is probably the most disgustingly violent major movie ever released. It's just drenched in non-stop gore, dismemberment, torture, misogyny, castration, evisceration, cannibalism, children about to be raped and murdered, people dismembering other people then feeding them to animals while they're still alive, etc. NC-17, where are you? <br/><br/>But the worst thing is there's just no point, other than perhaps Rodriguez had some extreme misanthropic anger to vent, exacerbated by making the tame, PG-rated Spy Kids movies. And this movie is his humanity-filled punching bag, which he beats to a bloody pulp with the consistency of stewed tomatoes.<br/><br/>Is it a well-made movie? Sure. But why would anyone want to watch it? It's about as uplifting as watching a web cam of a Tyson poultry slaughter house, or animals being incinerated at your local humane society. Sin City is one place I wouldn't visit."

It has it all, even if sometimes it's really hard to tag along, you'll get it! Although I am a big fan of Owen, the old bugger Willis did an excellent job and my old time favorite Rourke makes one of his best performances ever (He's done a lot of amazing ones), this makes for a great feature! I thought. And then I saw it. And all my expectations just crept higher after the first scene! It sort of culminated when i saw Alba in her scene, that was just about too much to bear. Even if it's a bit slow when Clive does his stuff (Da old bugger, he should be DA baddest AZ) it's still such a pretty picture of the old comics that Frank Miller gave us.

","Now, I had never heard of the graphic novels that Sin City was based on, and therefore i had absolutely no idea what to expect, espesh as over here in the UK, it hasn't been released yet so no-one could tell me.<br/><br/>In a nutshell, it is an awesome film, artistically directed(mostly in black and white but with dashes of colour) and superbly written. If someone was to describe a stereotypical dark comic book to you, it would be an exact representation of what Sin City is. My personal description is Pulp Fiction vs The Punisher.<br/><br/>The outstanding performance in it is undoubtedly Mickey Rourke, as he manages to pull off a 'hellboy-like' character, but Clive Owen surprises as a hard-guy(even his accent is believable), and there is appearances by so many other famous actors/actresses it shows that they really thought that Sin city was a project that they needed to be involved with,and rightly so.<br/><br/>All in all, everyone should see this film. Even though it is pretty gory in places(be-headings aplenty), there is little red blood in the film, which takes the edge off a little bit and so means it doesn't go down Kill Bill territory.<br/><br/>See this film. And anyone who says this film is anything but good to awesome, is(as Hartigan says in the film) ""As expert as a palsy victim doin' brain surgery with a pipe wrench"""
"bullet-catcher","10","3","6","9 April 2005"," A Triumph in The Town Without Pity
","I absolutely LOVED this movie.<br/><br/>I've been a fan of Frank Miller for over twenty years, and have felt since its inception that the world of SIN CITY was the perfect place for the artist/author's talents to shine. Basin City presented the purest, most dynamic place (geographically and figuratively) for Miller to lay the groundwork for some of the most evocative stories to explode from the graphic-prose genre in years. A city of his own making, SIN CITY continued to evolve, becoming darker and richer and meaner with every issue. I loved them.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Robert Rodriguez earned my total respect and devotion for the slam-bang gusto and bravura that he's displayed in the MARICHI trilogy. (Not to mention FROM DUSK TIL DAWN, which I consider a world of delirious fun!) What was great about watching his own creation was seeing his talents also evolve before our eyes. A small yet inventive student's movie leaped to full-scale major motion picture to Texas-sized blockbuster epic in the space of three movies.<br/><br/>And in SIN CITY the audience now has the perfect creative marriage of two virtuosos of the hit-and-run action drama. It's just a blast and a half! Having collected all the books almost from the beginning, I can say it's downright freakish how much the film matches the books, panel-for-panel in most instances. The choice of including three rotating stories makes perfect since, since they are each propelled along at such breakneck speed it's like clinging to a bullet for dear life. The actors were beautifully cast, and they do a wonderful job of inhabiting their characters. As much as possible with a film of this type, they bring them to life. And for at least one actor, the on-screen results are nothing short of astounding.<br/><br/>Mickey Rourke IS Marv. (I read in an article that he took copies of the books to his psychiatrist lamenting, ""THIS is how they see me!"") Probably the single most larger than life character to emerge from the most-wanted list of Miller's protagonists, Marv was always the one I thought it would be impossible to cast. Physically, no one looks like him -- at least no one I'D care to meet. He's a hulking, brutish thug of a human being. Temperamental, insanely violent, a juggernaut of discord and retribution...and yet the audiences CHEERED for him each time I saw the movie. I wouldn't be surprised if some of his lines of dialogue are quoted years from now.<br/><br/>Marv serves as the perfect representation of the driving instincts of the other characters (good and bad), the city itself, the graphic prose stories the movie is based on, and both Miller and Rodriguez. He has his own internal logic, and a moral barometer that doesn't fall into alignment with the rest of the world -- but it's there. He's loyal to a fault, unrepentantly so, and will suffer no end of damage to right an unforgivable wrong. Do his ends justify his means? Of course not, at least in the real world, but they explain them.<br/><br/>The movie takes chances with its gorgeous black-and-white. It's so rich and absorbing it makes color seem tame by comparison. It also takes chances with its almost gleefully manic violence and in-your-face sexuality. It never panders and seems to be asking other action-adventure-dramas the question: ""Is that the best you pansies can do?"" all the while spitting blood and bile and mussing up their faces.<br/><br/>The actors are a delight. When Rosario Dawson smiles, she IS Gail. The casting of Elijah Wood for his killer role was inspired. Powers Booth - a personal favorite from his days as Philip Marlowe on HBO - is grandly evil. Bruce Willis has a face and demeanor that exists perfectly in this cold, monochromatic world. (And I have to mention that I found the relationship between his Hartigan and the young Nancy at the beginning of the movie even more touching than it was in the books. This was something that could only be achieved by live actors, and good for them.)<br/><br/>I can't wait for more movies set in the town without pity. And I also can't wait to see following movies stitched into the continuity established in this first one. Kudos to all involved; I can't praise the filmmakers - everyone in front of and behind the cameras, from grip to animator to publicist and beyond - enough for crafting such a sharp piece of work.<br/><br/>Thanks for NOT holding back. Here's to SIN CITY -- one helluva ride!"

"highclark","9","3","6","5 April 2005"," There's wrong and there's wrong and then there's this---9/10.
","In a film where the lead characters continually absorb the effects of bullets to the body like mere mortals deflecting verbal insults to the ego, 'Sin City' will never ask you nicely to suspend belief for two hours; it will demand that you do so. Once you're able to pass this belief hurtle, the only other obstacles remaining are those that make up 'Sin City's' lifeblood, and very likely, the main obstacle to whether you will love or hate this movie; that is, the relentless violence that is regularly brutal, occasionally gruesome, and at times, surprisingly comical.<br/><br/>How 'Sin City' succeeds in displaying such horrific scenes of violence is that it never becomes stale or boring in the way the images are brought to life. Every frame of 'Sin City' is alive, sleek, clear and beautiful. Never before has the cinema seen such vibrancy and life in the images of darkness and death. <br/><br/>However, the idea of two vastly different tastes being brought together as one is nothing new. Think of any disaster to occur in the world at any time, natural or otherwise, and you'll see that Hollywood has not only made a movie about it, but more than likely, a love story. It should really come as no surprise that someone has finally made a stunningly beautiful black and white film, like say, 'Last Year in Marienbad' and introduced pedophiles and machete's into where there once was love affairs and broken hearts. The American masses will always flock to see a love story set aboard a sinking ship or a doomed air flight, just as long as the lovers are young and hot. And whereas Marv (Mickey Rourke) isn't really much of a looker, 'Sin City' can still boast of featuring some very fine looking women, most notably an angelic Jessica Alba as Nancy. So if the Hollywood love story formula can work for Leo and Kate in 'Titanic', then it can work for Clive and Rosario, Bruce and Jessica, and most importantly, Mickey Rourke and Jaime King in 'Sin City'.<br/><br/>Detractors of the film will be quick to point out that the film glorifies violence and portrays women as nothing more than hookers or strippers. I can't really defend that claim, as much as I would want to. But I would ask, is it misdirected misogyny or simply a virginal veneration? Sure, the female's in the film are either hookers or strippers, but the lead men in 'Sin City', namely being Marv, Hartigan and Dwight, are looking to protect these women, or in the case of Marv, to avenge their murder. Both Marv and Hartigan say at separate times in the film that they don't want the women they're protecting to see the damage they're going to inflict on the males responsible for their crimes against these women. These acts of chivalry constitute the loving heart of 'Sin City'. Yeah, I know, it still doesn't address the misogyny issue, but I never said 'Sin City' was perfect.<br/><br/>Although 'Sin City' is likely to be ignored by the Academy this year, largely due to the rash decision from its maverick director, Robert Rodriguez to include Frank Miller as a Co-Director of the film, make no mistake, 2005 will go down in the film history books as the year of 'Sin City'. 2005 will play itself out as a repeat of 1941. That was the year when the Academy grossly ignored another beautifully filmed black and white masterpiece, 'Citizen Kane'. I'm not saying that 'Sin City' is as good as 'Citizen Kane', but rather that like 'Sin City', 'Citizen Kane' was also snubbed by the Academy due in large part to the brazen indifference its maverick director, Orson Welles showed towards the Hollywood movie making machine. Welles made a film without compromise and paid a heavy price in doing so for the rest of his life. Rodriguez, at the time of the release of 'Sin City' has resigned from the Directors Guild in order to make his film his way, not Hollywood's. I would have to think that Rodriguez won't be ruined by Hollywood, you see, Hollywood has too much to lose. As a side note: I find it terribly amusing that for such a violent movie, Rodriguez's movie isn't one he has necessarily directed, it is a film that he has 'shot and cut'.<br/><br/>Also, how ironic is it that in a film where Mickey Rourke makes a successful comeback, he is all but unrecognizable underneath layers of prosthetics? Tough break Mickey, but you're used to it.<br/><br/>'Sin City' is a grim and breathtaking shot in the arm for the film industry. It is an anomaly of its time, comparative to the type of commercial films being made today. However it should be noted, this shot in the arm will leave track marks, maybe even a festering scab. I love that 'Sin City' exists, but I can't believe a commercial film like this can even exist in the theaters of today. <br/><br/>As it is whispered by Josh Hartnett in the opening segment of the film, ""I see a crazy calm"". He could've been referring to the character of Kevin as played by Elijah Wood, but it could also be the 'crazy calm' before the storm. In a nation full of scared soccer moms, sound bite Senators and as always, the highly impressionable youth, this movie could end up being the fall guy for all that is ailing America. I almost hope that scenario plays itself out so I can eventually hear our Commander in Chief speak out to the former first lady, ""Cover your eyes, Nancy, I don't want you to see this"".<br/><br/>And while it's true that there is bad, and there will always be bad, at least for now there is this.<br/><br/>9/10.

","This film is more or less a collection of stories based on the graphic novel series. Sin City is visually stunning and does an amazing job at capturing the look and feel of the comic book series. Rodriguez succeeded in recreating the graphic novel into live action, rather than making a movie adaptation.<br/><br/>Although remaining true to its literary roots, certain aspects of Sin City did not translate well to the big screen. Sin City's excessive use of voice-overs creates inactivity and releases any tension or build-up which the story may otherwise have had, leaving the viewer disinterested and bored despite the multitude of violent action sequences.<br/><br/>If you're not a fan of the comics, you'll find that the movie is fractured such that each story has almost no connection with another. It's as if watching several short films one after another, leaving no underlying theme of the movie and no real climax.<br/><br/>There are a couple casting mistakes in this film but for the most part these can be overlooked. The only notable performance in the film is Mickey Rourke's portrayal of Marv. Rourke manages to make this section of the film enjoyable.<br/><br/>Sin City may be cinematic ally unique in what it tried to accomplish (a live action copy of a comic book), but it's not the kind of film worth watching twice unless perhaps you're a big Frank Miller fan."

The unbelievable - it can only happen in the comics - type of scenes (like the blood was usually white when someone was shot). Primarily a black and white movie with good usage of colorizing for emphasis (primarily red, but other colors too) It seemed like 4-5 short stories, but they come together and make sense. I personally would not pay to see this movie, but I respect the artistic approach and how many others would find this a very good movie. This may be a new cult classic.<br/><br/>Violence was greatly fictionalized (comic style) however sexual overtones (while only containing brief nudity) were adult in nature - with the prostitute outfits.<br/><br/>Most laughter was from absurdly implausible events - that can only happen in the comics. Unfortunately at time the movie drifted to be more of a movie than a comic-come-to-live and the style was not completely consistent.<br/><br/>Earlier today, March 16, 2005, I was able to view an advanced screener. It was packed. Hearing comments of fellow movie-goers, it was a love-it/hate-it type movie. I personally sided towards the hate-it, but only because of my personal taste - again from a ""film as art"" sense it was a good movie."
"cmccollum2","1","3","7","26 September 2005"," Worst film ever made
","This was the first time I have ever been truly offended by a movie. I've been shocked by a lot but never really offended. The movie was the most degrading movie towards women that has ever been made. The premises is about a city where everything and everyone is corrupt and do dirty things. The male characters are constantly saving women as their only form of self gratification. The main characters name is Hartigan (pronounced Hard-again). He is an older ex-cop trying to finish off his career with a bang and have one last triumph. His target is a man who has had his penis cut off and there for turns yellow and demon like, as if his penis is the only thing a man can be proud of. There are a lot female characters but only one of them isn't a prostitute, she is a stripper instead. These seem to be the only jobs present for women in this town. They are forced into their own section of town called the ""Old Town"" where they can make the rules with out pimps. Yet they are still only prostitutes and when they get into trouble the still rely on men to come and save Old Town. The entire movie sexualizes women. Most of the male characters beat the women they hire and not a single female character finds anything wrong with it. The men are pathetic and only find gratification in sex and violence. I have no problem with graphic sex or violence if it is necessary to the point of the artwork. I think that often it is necessary and when done tastefully adds a lot to a film. The main problem with Sin City is that it is a film with no point. I don't find the glorification of needless sex, violence and poor treatment of women as a necessary point to any film. I do not think that this movie should have been made at all but since it was I cannot nor do not think that is should be censored. I just hope that people, especially women, who watch it realize its vulgarity and tastelessness in regard to gender."

It seems we are moving in a direction where we have come from to allow utter sh1t like this into movie theaters. After watching for a while I thought to myself - OK, this can't get any sicker and then, amazingly, yes it did, and then I thought to myself, this can't get any sicker and then, guess what, and so on and so forth!!! Well, that's the last time I see an 8.4 rating and take it at face value. How is it possible that this movie, sick trash that it is can get a higher rating than a movie like ""War of the Worlds"" for example. Lets get real people! And to thing that I did not see any user comments that gave spoilers otherwise I would never have come within 90 miles of the theatre. Perhaps the shock of seeing a movie like this put off people from wanting any association to it even make a comment.<br/><br/>So I bet you get it now.

","This heavily stylised distillation of all those great black and white movies of the thirties and forties takes every noir-tinged cliché, packs it into copper jacketed dum-dum bullets, and fires it at point blank range, in the head and the heart. Sin City is Violence and Emotion writ LARGEan excellent movie that ALL crime readers and viewers will lap up like the promise between the smooth thighs of a femme fatale! I loved this film, and it screams at me to get acquainted real quick with ALL Frank Miller's Sin City graphic novels.<br/><br/>One draw-back to the uninitiated; this movie is dialogue heavy, but the brilliant and original visuals make up a perfect balance. The film, as you all probably know is shot in the style of a comic book, with frames that carry the bare minimum of props ie, lit foreground revealing actor and single prop like a hospital tray and a drip feed. This style replicates the old studio pictures which were made on a tight budget, but it is used here to accentuate performance and scene. Many black and white film stocks are used in the telling of the tales within Sin City, as are vivid and garish sprays of stylised colour; blood is a sickly yellow, eyes glow green.<br/><br/>I hear there are going to be two further movies shot back to back later this year. I await those with breath bated!!<br/><br/>I give Sin Citynine out of ten!<br/><br/>Now I'm off to re-watch some classic Cagney crime capers!!"

","I've never before felt like walking out on a movie but with this one I was so bored I nearly fell asleep... twice! I love comic books and this one should have stayed as one. It was extremely violent, with to much nudity and next to no story. It could have been edited better to bring the story together. The second half was better that the beginning. The two good parts were the commentaries which were true to the original stories and the very two dimensional black and white cinematography. It just didn't flow well though as a story. A waste of my time. I can see why there were only 2 women in when I went to see it. It wouldn't appeal to many women but more to male fantasies with the blood, guts, enormous guns and kinky leather thongs. Even this makes it sound better than it was. It takes more than special effects, chopping, slicing and thumping to make a good movie. The actors did well with the dialogue they had, but no where did any of it stretch their acting chops. Jessica Alba looked the part but didn't get the chance to 'act'which was a shame as she has talent. Overall, disappointing."

","I found it to be incredibly imaginative in concept, but totally boring in execution, unless you count the 437 deaths in your quality quotient! The artistic side is truly admirable, although not original. The occasional colour usage was touched on in Dick Tracy years ago. The conceptual error in the movie construction is that you can transpose paper to digital using cinematic art as your medium and it decays in interest. Verbatim transposition from script to film leaves a few dimensions unexplored. Hoping to finally find someone doing a scene beyond ""foot rub"" left me seriously disappointed. To target imaginative cyber thinkers who have worn out their Dungeons and Dragons game and needed a break from Yahoo chat is OK just warn us we need to bring something to read if we want any real depth."

Elijah Wood shows us his dark side, Bruce Willis kicks ass as the 'last good cop', and Clive Owen is the king of Cool. <br/><br/>If Robbo can keep this up for the sequels, we could actually be looking at one of the best trilogy's to come out in recent years!<br/><br/>Sit back, let your jaw hit the ground and watch the chaos unfold!!"

Though the film really looks great, especially fighting scenes, but it is VERY, VERY, VERY DULL.<br/><br/>Lots of talking. I hated that narrator, even in documentaries author usually doesn't speak so much. He just talks and talks. The things he speaks don't make any sense at all, they are just mad man's mumbling.

","I walked out on this movie, and even went so far as to contemplate demanding my money back. I didn't, because I like the theater, and because I feel like I brought this on myself. Sure, I'd read reviews about how this was, quote & unquote, ""sinsational"", but really, what kind of person goes to see a movie where they watch: -The vivisection of NUMEROUS humans, -Scenes with priests confessing to cannibalism, and, more disturbing to me, -A girl who was eleven/twelve when this guy was sixty, kissing him when she's nineteen/twenty. And it was a Kiss. Now, it's OK if you feel like America is too conservative, and etc. And it's even alright to write books or papers on true stories about how awful the world is. But to make a comic book, and then a movie, and market it as ""sinsational"", when all it is is gruesome images put together in a madcap way, doesn't make sense to me. The plot (WHAT PLOT?!) made no sense, there was no story, or way to care about the characters. I'd heard that there were deaths of good people, but I just didn't care enough when they died. Oh, well, with the number of bad movies out there, it's not surprising that this one was complete and utter crap. Still, people LIKED this? Anyone who did is strange to me.

","I'm not a comic book fan but read reviews that stated even if I wasn't I could get a lot our of Sin City. I really wish someone would have warned me about the excessive, gratuitous violence found in Sin City. The film was physically and emotionally exhausting. The members of the audience that were laughing certainly weren't paying enough attention to the decay of humanity found within. Luckily I didn't end up with nightmares as I went to see a matinée. I had to decompress with more than an hour of South Park to erase the horrors of Sin City. Even though blood and guts were portrayed in colors other than red it was readily apparent that this was indeed the innards of another person. The one redeeming part of the film was the director's fascination with some amazing female buttocks."
"lajospn","2","3","7","4 April 2005"," Gory Emptiness
","I went in the cinema expecting something novel. I got the standard fare instead. Tough talking gangsters? Whores with guns? Extreme violence? The movie should have a big 'Recycled' stamp all over it. Basin City is Gotham City, but to a T. Nothing new here. The character of the concrete tough guy Marv (played nicely by Mickey Rourke, I must admit) was nothing new: he reminded me of the 'overtaker' in William Gibson's novel ""Idoru"". In the novel the 'overtaker' is a big guy, full of scars, torturing criminals to death in order to get their money, but his heart (who would guess?) is made of gold. Oh yeah, and he wields a hatchet sometimes. Bruce Willis plays Bruce Willis as Hallenbeck. Oh, wait a minute, that was his name in the Last Boy Scout! Here he's called Hartigan. The differences are imperceptible. Since Tarantino is involved we have the obligatory Katana wielding Samurai whore. Luckily she doesn't talk too much (maybe she's a deaf-mute?). The difference from Kill Bill is that now she's using not one, wait for it!, but TWO full-size Katana at the same time! (And of course she likes to throw shuriken. Although if both hands are full how can she throw a shuriken? Maybe she spits them out? Who knows?) Comic book feel means that people like to jump off from great heights for great visual effect. (Really, how many times did one character or another fell ten-storeys or so just for fun? I stopped counting.) <br/><br/>After realizing that there's not going to be anything new in this movie I tried to enjoy it for its own sake. Boy, was it difficult. The dialog is bad, bad, and worse. I don't care if this is because it's supposed to be a comic book. So what? If they use a retarded 10-year-old to write the script and the result is incomprehensible, is it an excuse that he's retarded? What is this, special Olympics? GET SOMEBODY WHO CAN WRITE BEFORE DOING A MOVIE! Comic book fans can have (enjoy?) the original 'corny but brilliant' conversations. They can have the plot too. It commits the biggest crime a story can do: it's boring. By the time the movie got back to Hallenbeck's story the second time I wished it'd been over already. Really, there was nothing to keep my attention story-wise. Absolutely nothing. Here is the pattern: bad guys show up, good guy's sure to die, I'm sure he won't die, yawn, he manages, yawn, to escape (uninterestingly), yawn, bad guys die horrible deaths. Back to square 1: bad guys show up, ...<br/><br/>Maybe it's the comic book tradition but bad guys always shoot at the body while the good guys, cleverly, shoot at the head.<br/><br/>One more thing: maybe if they cast Rutger Hauer as Hartigan and Benicio Del Toro (without the stupid makeup) as Dwight the movie could have been better. (These two could turn the corniest of dialogs into something interesting.)<br/><br/>Ah, I almost forgot. The violence part: take it away and nothing remains but emptiness."
"mightyjalapeno","10","3","7","3 April 2005"," Movie Review: Sin City
","Movie Review: Sin City I just went and saw this movie tonight. I may have to go see it tomorrow, if my wife lets me. And cheap Tuesday. With luck, I can see it in a different city next weekend.<br/><br/>But enough with the editorializing. This is a movie that will definitely polarize the viewers. From what I could tell from the gasps, yells, laughs, and hooting, my fellow audience-members liked it. Some people on the way out were saying bad things about it. It was hard for me to keep from pounding their skulls flat on the hard, cold, packed earth of an unholy barn floor.<br/><br/>Whoops, editorializing again. My adrenaline is still a little bit high.<br/><br/>From the man who brought respectability back to comics, and the man who could inexplicably produce ""El Mariachi"" and ""Spy Kids 3D"" in the same lifetime, comes Frank Miller's Sin City. Not once does it shy away from the source material (except for Jessica Alba, who has a no-nudity contract clause). Marv does everything that you'd expect of an indestructible killing machine with a soft fluffy teddy bear heart wrapped in bloody razor wire. Hartigan is the man... bar none, Hartigan is the man. Nameless the Salesman, although only in two scenes, perhaps drives home most poignantly the morality of Basin City. Nancy, skinny little Nancy Callahan, is perhaps the only innocent soul in the city.<br/><br/>In Sin City, in the very, very broadest terms and with an extremely loose definition of the word ""good"", the good guys win. Marv finds justice in dispensing of pain and blood, but it is justice. Hartigan, in the name of the law and love, finds justice in sacrifice. Dwight and Gail protect the way of life of the Old City, and it just so happens that a whole mother-loving pile of bodies gets left in the wake. Elija Wood, good old Frodo Baggins, gets whats coming to him with a smile on his silent lips. That was such a weird sentence to write.<br/><br/>The cinematography is dead-on. Some panels of the book look just like the movie. Some panels of the movie look just like the book. The attention to detail is remarkable. The Woman In The Red Dress's eyes glow green for the second that a lighter is held to her cigarette. The transition from two-color monochrome animation to four color movie (black, white, gray, and blood) and back is seamless. Only on a very few occasions can you tell that the background is green-screened, when the motion doesn't 100% synch up. Even so, 99% synch rate is pretty damn good.<br/><br/>Although there were...two... five...ten.... uhm.... seventy-odd murders in this movie, and pretty much every main character (and even some hot supporting characters) end up soaked in blood at one point, this is still a marvellous set piece, beautifully crafted, and filled with characters as rich and colorful (if the tiniest bit wooden *cough*Madsen*cough*) as any you are likely to encounter. I recommend this for anyone who likes film noir, violence, or that feeling in your stomach when your entire life has led up to a single hard decision, and you go with what your heart knows is right, and the world can go **** itself if it doesn't agree.<br/><br/>10 out of 10."

","The night comes across as glum; she's pretty, and he's handsome. They stand on a balcony, well dressed and looking smart. She seems scared, he seems allured but the actual reasons for his presence are deeper and more sinister than you'd first think. They look at one another; the male narrates to us how he feels; colours light up, as do the final cigarettes one of the two parties will ever have. The cigarette smoke jostles with the death that is in the air, only we cannot see it just yet. They embrace, and after this fatal exchange we crash backwards off the balcony overlooking a peculiar skyline before zooming out to encompass a bird's eye view of the entire town. Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Basin City.<br/><br/>On release, Sin City was a noir like nobody had ever seen before, indeed, I have seen few films since that have come close to matching the film as a whole. The film is a strange mix of down-to-Earth basics and homages to noir mixed with out and out escapism. The film's dynamics see characters shot, stabbed, run-over, blown-up and beaten senseless yet still manage to soldier on; whereas cars can shoot along rainy cliff-side roads at dizzying speeds but maintain on course and in control without ever crashing off. Despite all of this, the film maintains a focus; it sticks to its noir infused guns like nobody's business, delivering three stories of unrelenting passion and energy that unfold in a manner that is respectable enough to most things it takes on; be it difficult subject matter, levels of realism or attitudes to women.<br/><br/>The film is broken up into three tales of respective men in crisis, three tales that you might say are linked by their leads' attitudes and dedication to women. The first, and last since it's revisited later on, sees elderly cop John Hartigan (Willis) involved in a rescue mission before a somewhat taboo romance tale; the second is a frothing mad revenge tale driven by love born out of the respect a woman had for a hulking thug named Marv (Rourke); while the other one is a causality inspired, MacGuffin driven piece detailing the misadventures of a certain Dwight (Owen), as he strives to rid a section of Basin City of a particular object that'll spell disaster for hundreds. Some are more violent than others, some more far-fetched; Hartigan's story is the easiest to latch onto due to its obvious connotations of good vs. pure evil playing out; two stories will end somewhat unhappily and one particular tale will straddle the line that pushes subject matter into the realms of horror. But all three will draw on inspiration from decades of Hollywood noir and deliver powerful, gut-wrenching fables of down and dirty people striving to get by told amidst levels of exciting entertainment and escapism.<br/><br/>Director Robert Rodriguez knows where he's coming from with Sin City. By way of updating a series of graphic novels, littering them with a number of homages and using the latest in computer green-screen technology, he's created something that he will not match for the rest of his career. From the off, the first story entitled That Yellow Bastard is littered with nods and references. Hartigan, the gruff talking and close to down-and-out cop, drives his car down a straight road although needlessly twists his steering wheel in what instantly calls to mind 1945's Detour, amongst many other B-movie noirs, and their dodgy backdrops. A few miles away, a young healthy girl named Nancy sits tied to a chair, scared witless, as a door opens and Rodriguez tosses in that element of expressionism as a creepy and evil being casts a shadow over the wall, perhaps calling to mind Fritz Lang's 1931 film M. Later on, we will come to understand the Sunset Blvd. reference Rodriguez was, like that respective film, playing us with the whole time.<br/><br/>On another strand, we're told Marv was unlucky to be born in the wrong century thanks to his uncanny ability to reach distressing levels of violence. This plants some dangerous seeds in our minds as to what he's capable of. We don't get to see him in a Roman arena, swinging an axe into some other gladiator's head, but later on we get to see him swing a hatchet into a corrupt police officer's. Marv is a human tank; a self-identified border-line psychopath whose tale tiptoes over the border that separates noir from horror, all for sake of Goldie (King), a lowlife hooker that made Marv feel important and wanted. Rodriguez will have him struggle (as he will Dwight in the tar-pits) in the rural farm setting before breaking trend and have him come to dominate this locale. The punishment Marv takes throughout is reminiscent to that of those 1980s Hollywood action stars, and how their bodies would be beaten and bashed and put through a grinder.<br/><br/>Dwight is one-part mockingly, one-part knowingly referred to as 'Lancelot' in his story entitled The Big Fat Kill, since his role as protector to domestic abuse victim Shellie (Murphy) might see him as a knight in shining armour. Later on, he becomes a knight of sorts to Old Town based dominatrix Gail (Dawson) and the rest of her red-light district girls when a group of dangerously sexually active men enter the fray; their sexual appetites costing them their lives by Japanese bodyguard Miho (Aoki) and her phallic samurai sword. But the film is not all men protecting women by way of holding their hand. Indeed, it explores the lengths certain men are willing to go for the female and Shellie's and Nancy's repeated attempts to stand up to their male aggressors in Jackie Boy and The Yellow Bastard, respectively, see them more than mere objects that need saving. Sin City is one of my favourites of the decade; a whirling, spinning experience of a film – the likes of which all should see."

It's also very exciting, very interesting, and at times very disturbing. I usually like to see all of those in a film like this, but what am I saying? There aren't many movies like this.<br/><br/>The film focuses on three main story plots. Mickey Rourke stars as man who is seeking the one who murdered a nice woman named Goldie(Jamie King). Clive Owen stars as Dwight, who's love is Shelly(Brittany Murphey) and tries to save The Old town girls(Rosario Dawson, Alexis Bladel, and more)from Johnny Boy(Benicio Del Toro) and eventually Manute(Michael Clarke Duncan). The final story plot involves a cop named Hartigan(Bruce Willis) who years ago made an oath to save a girl named Nancy(who later becomes Jessica Alba)and protect her from a pedophile(Nick Stahl). Who later becomes disgustingly yellow. That's the disturbing part of this movie.<br/><br/>If you loved Watchmen, and you see this, then you will try and forget about that.

Sin City, is a graphic novel style movie, mostly filmed in a stylish black and white picture, with stunning dashes of colour, when needed. This film doesn't only look superb, the acting, plot, action and characters are superb also. The action is right up there with great action films of our time, and the plot is so well scripted, even Stephen King would be jealous. Talking about action, this movie is non stop action, from the very beginning to the very climax. Colours are dashed in here and there, to create a great feeling on the watcher, and the main ""enemie"" is actually very colourful, your eyes will water with amazement. I recommend to everyone who loves 300 and Watchmen!"
"tburke85","8","2","4","8 June 2009"," Sin City A Solid Movie From A Graphic Novel
","Sin City is a solid movie from a graphic novel brought to the big screen by Robert Rodriguez. A great cast of talented actors help bring this movie to the big screen. Most of their screen time maybe limited but they make the best of their roles. The movie is set in a city overrun by corruption where the ladies are just as dangerous as the men. The cast is full of great talent for the most part. Jessica Alba is okay as Nancy a stripper but her character isn't memorable like some others. Devon Aoki does a good job in a role with no dialogue as one of the prostitutes of Olde Town. Alexis Bledel is decent as Becky another one girl from Olde Town who ends up being a backstabber. Rosario Dawson is convincing as Gail the leader of the Olde Town girls in her short screen time. Benicio Del Toro makes the best of his brief villain role as Jackie Boy a cop with penchant for violence but his part is cut short. The two actors to stand out are Clive Owen as Dwight a murderer with a new face who tries to stop Jackie Boy and Mickey Rourke as Marv a thug after the one responsible for killing his love Goldie. They both leave an impression even with their short screen time and are the best characters in the movie. Rourke's Marv provides some much needed dark comic relief to the film and Owen brings an intensity to his character Dwight. Well done. Bruce Willis shows up early on and then disappears for most of the movie only to show up near the end again but he makes the best of his smart part to play in the movie as well. The rest of the supporting cast including Jamie King, Josh Hartnett, Carla Gugino, Michael Clarke Duncan, Michael Madsen, Nick Stahl, Rutger Hauer, and Elijah Wood in a non-speaking role as one of the villains do what they can in their brief cameos but aren't developed enough for you to care about them or understand the reasons behind their actions. The pacing was a little slow and the voice overs done by the characters was a bit much at times but the good outweighs the bad. Overall Sin City is an entertaining graphic novel turned into movie using state of the art special effects that is obviously CGI but it fits the tone of the film. What really makes this movie work is the talented all star cast who help bring these imaginary characters from the graphic novels by Frank Miller to life. Sin City is sure to please any fan of Miller, Rodriguez, or graphic novels whose looking for a good movie to watch with equally impressive performances by most of the cast."
"meatloaf6","10","2","4","13 April 2009"," Mind Blowing.
","Being a big fan of the perhaps out-of-the-ordinary works of Robert Rodriguez and Frank Miller, i had to see this film. I hadn't actually heard of it being black and white, so that came as quite a shock to me- but it is used with just one other colour at a time to create a really nice effect that wouldn't be the same in full colour.<br/><br/>Normally i rate films a ten just to bring the average up if i think it is too low. However with this film i genuinely think that it deserves it. I think that the cast is one of the best ii have seen, especially Clive Owen and Bruce Willis. This combined with the over the top action, and complex storyline lead to one of the top 5 films i have seen in my entire life. This is a must-see."
"jzappa","6","2","4","23 July 2007"," We've All Seen It, We've Oo'd, We've Aah'd, But Does It Hold Its Own With The Company It's In?
","Everyone loves Sin City because not only is it an epic of blood-drenched action and sick, twisted violence and subject matter, but also filmed in black and white with specifically chosen and very richly realized colors and boasting both a cast riddled with names and faces we all love but the two directors that have delivered more on the super-cool blood-and-guts pulp entertainment level this generation than any other director. Well, as someone who has followed the careers of both directors, Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino, for nearly all of my life, I will say that I'm not impressed with Sin City at all. It is entertaining on the most basic level: It's sort of fun to watch when you're in a hotel and you're waiting for the other people you're with to wake up and it happens to be on TV. That's how much of an impact Sin City really has.<br/><br/>Let's take the cinematography Rodriguez is applauded for so, with the black and white sprinkled with color placements. Steven Spielberg did the exact same thing with Schindler's List, which was filmed entirely in black and white and had a single scene wherein there was one girl in a jittering crowd of many whose dress was chosen to be pink. This meant something as well. I'm not saying that Sin City should be compared to a film like Schindler's List, because Sin City is all about style, and that's fine. Many of our greatest entertainments are only exercises in style. But Schindler's List actually filmed. Sin City was shot with a regular camera on Rodriguez's little pet blue screen and fed through a machine so the black and white with the colors can all be added later. The difference is so loud and clear I'm almost deaf. Can no one see how campy Sin City really looks? It really looks goofy sometimes. Take the image where Mickey Rourke is swimming from the duct under the river as an example. The majority of the film really does not look so cool.<br/><br/>I understand that Rodriguez's intention was to create an exact cinematic replica of Frank Miller's original graphic novels. Well, that's fine. But why not make it a cool-looking cinematic replica? Rodriguez needs to learn to make movies like a real filmmaker makes movies. Real filmmakers know how to take risks by spending a little money, going to a real set, driving a real car, squibbing things instead of adding bullet holes later. Filmmakers are not little computer geeks having fun in their technologically converted garage in Austin, Texas. They're bold people who want to capture something intense or powerful, something personal that they imagine. Not some fluffy image anybody with that computer program could churn out. There is no talent in what he does. I am tired of him.<br/><br/>The voice-overs delivered by the film noir caricatures that populate this movie are like the fragmented, raspy-voiced, overzealous voice-overs during movie trailers. Also, they go way too far explaining what characters are thinking. If we're watching the movie, we should be able to figure certain things out without being baby-stepped through it. It truly gets aggravating to hear Bruce Willis's voice narrating himself through getting up off the floor. Just get up off the floor. And some of these characters speak like grungy Dashiell Hammett types from New York or L.A., and some sound like Midwestern or Southern high school drop-outs with really bad grammar, and some speak in dialect that can only be found in its purest form in superhero comic books. What region is this Sin City in?! Or Basin City, as it is called in the film.<br/><br/>Like I said, the film is very basically fun to watch. You stop over at your friend's house, and he and some other dope are watching Sin City, so you sit down and finish it with them, because that's exactly what you came over to do: Hang out. So let me tell you the good points of this film: Benicio Del Toro and Clive Owen, both very natural and very becoming in their roles, and also the perfect hero-and-villain match-up. Rosario Dawson, in quite a change of pace, is the highlight of the very conveniently male-pleasing female portion of the movie. Another good touch is Josh Hartnett's performance. In fact, I think his very small role, which is given zero backstory and the slightest indications, is perhaps the most clever of the entire ensemble.<br/><br/>Tarantino's little guest director scene is an interesting little bit but not at all distinguishable from the rest of the movie. Really, if you know the scoop, you know that Rodriguez invited Tarantino as a guest director so that he could try to prove to him that blue-screen and CGI film-making techniques are better than hands-on techniques. Notice that Tarantino did not convert."
"DukeNukem_ags","10","2","4","12 March 2007"," Frank Miller's Masterpiece
","Whoa! Frank Miller and Robert Rodriguez completely revolutionize movie-making with this groundbreaking, artistic and stylistic film.<br/><br/>When I saw the trailer, I did not really care to see the movie, yet I am very glad I did. The dialogue and voice-over narration is BRILLIANT. Each camera angle is BEAUTIFULLY shot to PERFECTION (capturing each frame of the comic book). The black and white (with some color) is PERFECT for this movie.<br/><br/>Overall, an AWESOME film, worth watching over and over again. I have never seen a movie quite like it before and it blew me away. The action-filled, beautifully-shot scenes never get old.<br/><br/>Edited 3-18-07: Be warned that there are some cheesy parts, but they do not subtract from the movie. In fact, they simply add a bit of humor and unrealism."
"Benjamin_Cox","9","2","4","8 September 2006"," Disturbing, uncompromising, brilliant - 91%
","Every now and again, I stumble across a film that makes me wonder why I'm not into graphic novels more than I am. I'm not a huge fan of graphic novels but whenever I see things like ""Road To Perdition"" or this simply amazing film from Robert Rodriguez, I can't help but think what I'm missing. Like his good buddy (and guest director) Quentin Tarantino and his best film, Rodriguez has fashioned a truly memorable picture out of multiple stories brought together in a black-as-Hell modern film noir and the result is pure gold. Already, I'm running out of superlatives and I haven't even explained why this film is essential viewing, providing you have the stomach for it.<br/><br/>""Sin City"" is set in Basin City and it is a dark and twisted place – the sort of urban nightmare where only the sick and the twisted live. Amid the darkness and perpetual rain, honest cop Hartigan (Bruce Willis) refuses to retire until he's protected stripper Nancy (Jessica Alba) from one of the true evils of the town. Over in Old Town, disturbed cop Dwight (Clive Owen) is plunged into a war between the ladies of the night – led by matriarch Gail (Rosario Dawson) – and the cops. And across town, the hulking man-monster Marv (Mickey Rourke) mourns for a dead prostitute, murdered beside him in his bed. But soon, his drive for revenge takes him on a blood-soaked journey through town to the very top and a farm on the outskirts of town, which has seen some truly vile crimes <br/><br/>What is truly spectacular about this film is that it is, in every sense, the graphic novel filmed. Every shot is exactly as it was in Frank Miller's original and the vision is pure and true. And what a vision it is, an extraordinary ensemble cast led by Willis and a resurgent Rourke appear in what may well be the darkest film noir ever made. The black-and-white look also matches the graphic novel (complete with milk-white blood and occasional flashes of colour) and the whole thing is a joy to behold. It must be said that due to the strength of the source material, ""Sin City"" is strictly adults only and a strong stomach is a must. Some of the scenes in this make ""Saw"" look like a Disney production. Even without the film's stunning appearance, blacker-than-black humour and rock-solid scripting, every actor gives their role their all and boy, does it pay off. Owen is fantastic as Dwight and shows what he could have done had he got the Bond job ahead of Daniel Craig. But Rourke has never been better, tearing the place up like a hurricane in a trench coat but with a black sense of humour and a wry smile.<br/><br/>This is, without a doubt, Rodriguez's opus – a film of such stunning brilliance that it is the equivalent of Tarantino's ""Pulp Fiction"". I know that sounds a bit much – ""Pulp Fiction"" is still one of my favourite films ever – but the style and feel of the piece is very similar. It's blacker and more ambitious, using a bigger budget to great effect in bringing ""Sin City"" to life. It's one of those rare movies that sticks in your mind and you remind yourself of key scenes or lines of killer dialogue (mainly Marv's) with a smile on your face. It isn't an easy film to watch, by any means, but it is a huge achievement and one that any fan of noir will kick themselves for missing. From the fantastic opening sequence where you struggle to keep your jaw from dropping, ""Sin City"" remains a film of consistently high quality and should deserve to be remembered and treasured for a long time."
"chimichambo","3","2","4","21 July 2006"," Too long, too shallow
","I am a comic-book fan. I like especially the work of writer Alan Moore, and I think that many of his comics tell you something about life, human nature or society which is new or at least is viewed from an original standpoint. I like what Frank Miller did for the Batman series, but I read a couple of issues of ""Sin City"" a few years ago, and wasn't impressed. The dialogue and character narration tried to seem profound, just like good noir films or novels used to be, but I couldn't find any true deep meaning; just overly pretentious lines that went nowhere. Perhaps it's because I didn't get it, but it seemed all form and attitude over substance to me.<br/><br/>As for the movie: I agree with everybody in that it's a very faithful adaptation. And I'm not talking only about the impressive and innovative visuals. I'm talking about the shallow, pretentious voice-overs, which sounded even more shallow and pretentious as spoken by actors than read in a comic book. I liked parts of the film more than the comic, though. The fragment about Mickey Rourke's character was exciting, well acted and funny -which the comic book was not, at least as far as I remember. The story with Bruce Willis and Jessica Alba bored the hell out of me. All sense of wonder, awe or disgust that the first third of the movie inspired in me were long gone. Besides, the sentimental and overly serious tone of the final fragment was at odds with the cartoony, more humorous first part. Considering that all the male leads are supermen of sorts and ALL the females are incredibly attractive women who perform -and are victims of- violent acts, the film seems a bit like an adolescent's fantasy (or a dirty old man's!).<br/><br/>In other words, I think it would have been a shallow but none the less entertaining movie had it been shorter."

","this will not be a summary, instead I have decided to comment on a few things that impressed me the most about this stellar movie. 2 things stand out. The Characters and ""Oh S%IT This Movie actually went there.? The combination of the brilliant characters and the continued suspense and sheer shock of the story has led me to believe that Sin City is the best Movie of 2005. The blood thirsty 'can you believe that happened' is a tribute to both Rodriguez and Terrentino. To further my point about outrageous characters, Frodo Baggins (Friendly Elijah wood) plays a prostitute hungry cannibal. The cast is filled with stars who play each role exceptionally well. Find out for yourself and take a ride into an underworld crawling with scumbag's, ruled by cutthroat women, and saved by noble heroes. The only thing I wanted at the end of this movie was another 4 remarkable stories."
"walken_on_sunshine","10","2","4","23 May 2006"," Sin City:The Docs Review
","Probably the best film in ages a unique,brilliant,beautiful,and violent piece of art from Frank Miller and Robert Rodriguez.Sin City contains some of the most beautiful visuals that are mostly black and white with highlighted colour creating an original,sleek,stylized look.The gigantic cast which includes Mickey Rourke,Bruce Willis,Clive Owen,Jessica Alba,Elijah Wood,Brittany Murphy and dozens of other big stars all give faithful and stunning performances particularly Mickey Rourke.Based on the graphic novel series Sin City is 3 separate stories of love,passion,betrayal,anger,violence,justice,and redemption.One follows a police officer who winds up being framed as a rapist when in fact he was the one who saved the little girl,another follows an ugly man who spends one night with a friendly hooker who is killed while sleeping,another is about a clandestine lady's man whose sole mission is to protect them from what they've already protected themselves from.Every story is a bloody tale of revenge with kills and death scenes more gruesome than Saw or The Devil's Rejects.The action is comic book style bar brawls,and contains plenty of gun action and hand to hand combat.The number one thing though is the violence is so brutal it becomes beautiful just by the way the film shows it.Generally you don't look at a man holding a severed head and say ""gee that looks like a really good painting"" but Sin City finds a way to make every frame look like gorgeous Gothic art.The dialog is 100% percent film noir and totally Quentin Tarantino like who by the way directs one brilliant scene in the film as a guest.Basically if you found Kill Bill,Domino,Pulp Fiction,From Dusk till Dawn,or Reservoir Dogs entertaining Sin City will please you guaranteed."
"m-deppenmeier","10","2","4","11 May 2006"," A masterpiece, please gimme more!
","This movie is one of the best five, I've ever seen. The atmosphere is absolutely brilliant and the actors are perfectly casted (especially Mickey Rourke has found his finally perfect role). The highly stylized graphics and effects are doing the rest. Robert Rodriguez has worked out his personal masterpiece in cooperation with Frank Miller. A nearly perfect performance with a very well dialogue choose. Rodriguez has taken just the best from the comics and formed it into a piece of modern film art. For fans of the comic this movie is a must have seen and for all fans of Action and Thrillers this movie is at least a superb highlight. It has been a long time that I've seen a good piece of action movie, but this time ended with Sin City and a half year later ""Vier Brüder"" what has been another masterpiece. I hope Hollywood will continue with this line of ambitious action movies. Two thumbs up and let's hope the second part of Sin City will be as good as the first (though Angelina Jolie). And I hope the German synchronization will be as good as the first one. ;)"

","I'm not a fan of comic books. Never have been, and probably never will be. Hence I cannot decide whether this film do the comics justice or not, (since I haven't read the comics nor even heard of them before) but I find it very hard to believe this masterpiece of a movie doesn't. This has got to be the greatest adaption from comics to the big screen of all time. I mean having seen this movie about 4 times now (I think) I find myself completely sucked into its surreal world every time I watch it. The way it's shot is awesome. The dialog is excellent and every character deliver their lines in such an amazing way one cannot help but to be almost mesmerized at times.<br/><br/>Every single actor give great, solid performances. Usually I'm not a big fan of Bruce Willis but he's perfect as Hartigan. No question about it. Also Clive Owen and Mickey Rourke stand out. But it doesn't really seem fare to point out single names since the whole cast is excellent! I found myself being fascinated by the world of Sin City and the characters within it to say the least, and although the violence can be very raw and not even justified most of the times it fits the mood of the film so I can't really say I disapprove of it. Furthermore the music sets the tone for the film perfectly and I like how the ending nicely wraps up with the beginning of the film.<br/><br/>I recommend this film and look forward to the sequel...<br/><br/>""An old man dies.

All the characters in this comic book movie are non-sympathetic, everyone is out to get each other and look after themselves and sex lingers on the surface always.<br/><br/>The composite cartoonish imagery is like Dick Tracy brought up to date, with the violence and smelly atmosphere turned up to number 11.<br/><br/>The direction is great, some of the dialog is clunky, but I found that to add to the charm and not to take away from it, also the the structure owes a lot to pulp fiction, and old pulp type movies in general.<br/><br/>Quite violent but gets away with it because of the cartoon qualities (LOL).<br/><br/>Now lets see if the sequels hold up!<br/><br/>A cool movie all in all, they should make more of these!"

","Frank Miller's Sin City is a film that knows no boundaries and gives no apologies. <br/><br/>Anyone who has read Frank's Sin City graphic novels will know that this is one of the most faithful adaptations of all time, maybe ever. The panels were practically lifted from the books and animated with actors. <br/><br/>Would this film have worked without green screen technology? No. It wouldn't have even worked without Robert Rodriguez handling it. He knew how easy it would have been to screw this film up and make it some dumb action movie. But he did it the way it should have been done. Differences between the books and the movie are few and far between, from the camera angles to the dialogue. The film is black and white, just like the novels, and some things are colored, such as eyes, shoes, blood, etc. There are maybe one or two different lines, but with Miller directing the actors on what to say, it could hardly be called unfaithful. <br/><br/>The film is three stories: <br/><br/>-One follows John Hartigan (Bruce Willis) protecting a stripper (Jessica Alba) from the vengeful son-of-a-senator pedophile Junior, also known as that yellow bastard (Nick Stahl).<br/><br/>-Another follows Marv (Mickey Rourke), a man who is trying to track down the killer of his love, Goldie (Jaime King).<br/><br/>-And the last follows Dwight (Clive Owen) making sure a corrupt cop (Benicio Del Toro) doesn't hurt any of the Old Town Girls, lead by Gail (Rosario Dawson).<br/><br/>With brilliant directing, great acting and stylistic violence, Sin City turns out to be one of 2005's best films, definitely one of the most stylish I have ever had the pleasure of watching. This is a must see."

","I always said that when it comes to a live concert you always know it's good when it appears like the band is having more fun than the audience. Well, in the case of Frank Miller's ""Sin City"" it appears as though Miller and veteran filmmaker Robert Rodriguez had more fun making this film than we do watching it.<br/><br/>The film is compiled nearly panel for panel, word for word from Miller's groundbreaking series of graphic novels. This is obviously a labor of love and it is so evident to the viewer while taking it all in.<br/><br/>There is no screen writing credit because they worked directly from the comics and Rodriguez was kicked out of the Director's Guild of America when he insisted that Miller get co-credit for directing the film. After all, he set up all the shots years earlier when he created the comic, both drawing and writing it from scratch.<br/><br/>This film had me on the edge of my seat from the intro to the end keeping my eyes wide open, causing them to dry up a bit because I couldn't manage to keep my peepers off the beautifully glorious black and white opera of violence that unfolded before me.<br/><br/>The film is three different stories, all taking place in Basin City. The sign entering the town has the BA in BASIN spray painted out, hence SIN CITY. The stories involve crooked senators and priests, cannibalistic serial killers, pedophiles, murderers, strippers and more. Surprisingly it all fits together rather well. Though the violence may be a bit much for some I found it to be justified right and proper. After all, this film is based on a disturbing series of graphic novels that never tried to dull itself down, but instead embraced its characters and respected the intelligence and taste of its readers.<br/><br/>The cast is absolutely perfect from the amazingly beautiful Jessica Alba as stripper Nancy Callahan, to Bruce Willis as the over-the-hill with a bum-ticker Cop, John Hartigan, to Mickey Rourke as Marv, the revenge filled monster out for blood. I believe that this is Rourke's finest performance as an actor and I would probably award him as the Best Supporting Actor of the Year. Although Jake Gyllenhaal (Brokeback Mountain), George Clooney (Syriana), Ed Harris (A History of Violence), and Paul Giamatti (Cinderella Man) were all excellent, I don't think they carried their respective films the way Rourke did here. Let's also not forget Rutger Hauer and Clive Owen throwing in some head turning roles in this comic-book movie masterpiece.<br/><br/>All in all, a brilliant Tour-De-Force from journeyman Robert Rodriguez who did everything from Visual Effects Superviser, to editing, to cinematography, to sound re-recording mixer, to co-directing of course. A definite 10 out of 10 and one of the best films all year."

I can tell that the director was intentionally trying to make the movie comic book like with the way the film was shot, the constant inner-thoughts we were allowed to hear and other things and that didn't bother me that much. I think it was the abnormal amount of blood and gore that troubled me most and as a comic book fan, I don't think I would have liked this type of comic anyway.

","The visual style of this film is simply amazing. It truly is not a film at all, but Frank Miller's graphic novels simply on the big screen. However, although Sin City is visually dazzling, the story-line and dialogue sure aren't. Here is when certain things should have been left out. What may have been awesome dialogue in a graphic novel just sounds plain corny and blah in the theatre. Its like the script was not adapted from the original, it was taken straight from it. So, all in all, Sin City is visually incredible, but the rest of it is just plain tiresome and corny. Now, I realize that a lot of people love and worship this movie. However, they are too blinded by the special effects and the ""coolness"" of it. I'm sorry, but the lines spoken by the characters are just way too sappy and sometimes overly sentimental. Again, what works in a graphic novel does not work in a film. I'm afraid that fact was overlooked. Also, be forewarned those who go and see this, Sin City did not need to work hard to earn its R rating."

The story is rapped in pieces, but all comes together and the action... Oh boy the action is truly amazing! The special effects are mind blowing, but the acting is absolutely the best.

The only one I really had a problem with was Alexis Bledel, but even she wasn't that bad. This movie looked good right off the bat with such an ensemble cast. Clive Owen was perfect as Dwight, a man trying to keep people safe from a maniac cop. Mickey Rourke literally brought the character of Marv to life in the best performance of his career.<br/><br/>Sin City keeps you on your toes with non stop action, plenty of humour, and cool moments that bring a smile to your face. The dialogue in the comics and therefore in the movie is so snappy that it will probably be a popular movie to quote in years to come.

"EUyeshima","8","2","4","14 December 2005"," High POW Factor for Audacious Thrill Ride Into Sin City
","A visually audacious movie and an unpredictably wild ride into palookaville, this is one unique film viewing experience. I am not familiar with Frank Miller's ""Sin City"" graphic novels, but my guess is that Miller, who shares a co-director credit with filmmaker Robert Rodriguez, has remained faithful in capturing the hard-boiled, crime-infested world of Basin City and its cynical inhabitants. It takes a visual cue from last year's ""Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow"" by green-screening the backdrops and using digitally-produced images as the landscape, but that's where the similarity ends. Instead of Sky Captain's sepia shadings, this one is in vividly rendered black-and-white with carefully selected splashes of color (perhaps inspired by Steven Spielberg's use of a red coat in the otherwise black-and white ""Schindler's List""). It evokes the perfect feeling for its modern-day film noir sensibilities which includes pulp fiction-type dialogue and a rogue's gallery of exaggerated characters, some made up in prosthetics to make you think you've landed in the dark side of a Dick Tracy comic strip. But Miller's world feels much different, at once capturing the cartoonish, highly stylized violence of Quentin Tarnatino's films (he is identified as ""Special Guest Director"" though I'm unclear what he exactly did) and the special effects-driven black humor of Robert Zemeckis' ""Death Becomes Her"" (which coincidentally also starred Bruce Willis).<br/><br/>The plot revolves around three separate stories that share some of the supporting characters but little more than that story-wise. Continuing to improve and deepen with age, Willis plays a tough-talking cop named Hartigan in the first one. Just before accepting his pension, he pursues one last case to save an 11-year old girl from the clutches of a murderous psychopath who happens to be the son of a US senator. The girl grows up to be a stripper, played blandly by a Lolita-esquire Jessica Alba. Completely unrecognizable as the actor who once enticed and coerced Kim Basinger in Adrian Lyne's ""9 1/2 Weeks"", Mickey Rourke portrays Marv, a contract killer who falls in love with a beautiful hooker who is murdered in her sleep. His journey in finding her killer creates the most concurrently harrowing and darkly hilarious joyride in the movie, replete with decapitated heads of beautiful women mounted on a wall, a mute psycho-killer played by Elijah Wood (stunt casting for sure but intriguing in exposing a dark side to his Frodo persona) and a comic electric-chair execution scene. Rourke is a revelation, grotesquely ugly and built like a Mac truck but strangely insightful and impervious to what happens to his character. The third story is the most surreal with a monotone-voiced Clive Owen, an almost heroic fugitive named Dwight, who saves a mouthy barmaid (an annoying Brittany Murphy) and a gang of empowered prostitutes (led by his former lover played in convincing dominatrix fashion by Rosario Dawson) from a corrupt cop. A Cyrano-nosed Benicio del Toro portrays the cop with his trademark fiery menace in what feels like a throwback to his career before ""Traffic"". Dead people don't stay dead in any of the stories, but in this one, the concept is taken to an extreme, and the clutches between Owen and Dawson amid the violence provide a surprisingly amusing touch.<br/><br/>Everybody seems to be having a good time, and it's nice to see some otherwise under-the-radar actors get a chance to chew on some scenery in atypical roles, chief among them Carla Gugino as a perennially nude lesbian parole officer, Nick Stahl as the senator's son who becomes the comically disgusting Yellow Bastard, and in seething, whatever-happened-to-them cameos, Powers Boothe and Rutger Hauer. All the ingredients are so over-the-top that I was hoping the three stories would synthesize more than they do perhaps in the hope of a greater untapped theme. Moreover, for a movie so dependent on style to sustain itself over its two-hour-plus running time, it does feel a bit overlong and at times, repetitive in its visual elements. After all, one can take in only so many severed heads and limbs and heads shoved in toilets, as well as the inordinate amount of blood splattering in colors ranging from red to white to yellow. But no matter, as Rodriguez and Miller have fashioned something quite startling and entertaining here, a comic book come to life. Not for everyone's tastes but this is fun for those willing to take the ride."

","From the fertile, creative mind of fiction writer Frank Miller, arrives this powerful new comic-book turned movie entitled Sin City. The film itself contains the rare but measured ingredients of a true classic comic. What the viewer discovers is a crimson colored, black and white film jam packed with live action, special effect and and electrically charged 1950's comic drama from beginning to end. The extraordinary and exciting talents of Bruce Willis, Powers Booth, Michael C. Duncan and Rutger Hauer are further enhanced with the surprising, psychotic appearance of Elijah Wood as an super powered nearly unstoppable maniac. If this combination is not enough, there is yet, one other surprising feature in Sin City which nearly steals the show from all the other actors. This is the superb acting, extraordinary ability and super makeup of the multi-talented Mickey Rourke. Directing this fantastic assemblage of fine actors is multi-talented Robert Rodriguez, who has created in the words of this reviewer, a Cult Classic which will endure far into the future of films. ****"

"IMDbutter","3","2","4","26 September 2005"," Read the Books
","To love this movie is to not have read the graphic novels by Frank Miller. Its a cute movie, but it pales in comparison to the original. In order to bring the books to the screen, Rodriguez would have had to do more than a shot-for-shot remake. Sure the visuals are stunning, but they are all the more so on a printed page. The acting in this movie was laughable, with a few exceptions which I don't care to bother mentioning. Some may see this as a fault of the pulp-noir writing style, but you would have to take my word for it that it feels much more authentic in print. This movie was a farce, and only an achievement by the post-production team that translated Miller's visual style to the film medium. I don't respect the direction or production design at all, because I think it is the responsibility of film makers to interpret and expand on adapted work. Whether you love or hate this crappy movie, I guarantee you will enjoy the books more. If you've read the books already (which is to love them,) I'd recommend skipping the movie. It gives you nothing new to enjoy, and dilutes the impact of the print versions. Oh, except that Jessica Alba is so hot that her terrible acting and weak characterization may be the only excusable failure of this movie. OK fine, if you are male, you might want to see this junker to gawk at Ms. Alba. But you'll hate everything else if you have a modicum of taste."

","Absolutely stunning and extremely hard hitting urban thriller based upon three Frank Miller graphic novels and in return, you get ""Sin City"" (Miller, Robert Rodriguez, and Quentin Tarantino share the directing duties) and the title itself doesn't lie.<br/><br/>Three tales take place throughout the film, each one is excellent, very creative, the visuals are the icing on the cake, and considering which yarn stands out in my view, the one involving Marv (Mickey Rourke in his best role in years), a vengeful loner who sets to find out who was responsible for killing Goldie (Jaime King), a woman who Marv was with at night and framing him in the process. However, another tale, this one involving Hartigan (Bruce Willis), a former cop who vows to prevent a pedophile (Nick Stahl) dubbed ""The Yellow B--tard"" due to his appearance is literally frightening (and I mean more frightening than Freddy Krueger) from harming Nancy (Jessica Alba).<br/><br/>If the visuals and the music make the movie very creative, then you have to mention the cast for sure. Miller and Rodriguez deserve a lot of credit in getting the right actor or actress for each key part in the three tales.

"writing_ink","3","2","4","24 August 2005"," A Solid Film School Project
","Sin City opens with a scene between Bruce Willis and Michael Madsen - two actors that aren't among the greatest talents that Hollywood has to offer, but two actors whom I enjoy and who are capable of more than just holding their own in the right role. And this should have been the right role for both of them. Dark. Gritty. Crime-ridden. Willis as a golden-hearted, tough-minded beat cop and Madsen as a much darker version of the same. Unfortunately, my first thought was, ""Madsen isn't even acting. He's just standing there, reading his lines. What's up? He really sucks!"" And my second thought, which was repeatedly endlessly throughout what I can only loosely define as a ""film"" was, ""Okay... These are some pretty solid actors. At some point, this movie has to get better."" It never did.<br/><br/>To the makers of Sin City, I want a refund. You owe me $3 and the two hours of my life I lost enduring this total piece of drek. Had I known going in how outrageously bad this entire film was going to be from start to finish, I would have picketed the video store with a large placard that said, ""Sin City is Spy Kids with boobs and violence - only not as good as that sounds."" At some point, an actor actually has to act. The monotone delivery of lines has it's place, but should not be used in every scene by every actor in the movie. (Thank you, Brittany Murphy, for actually emoting!) This was the first film I have ever seen where every single major character thinks that they're the narrator. What in the hell were you thinking? And yet, in the midst of what was a plot less collection of short-stories masquerading as a movie, tucked among what were universally horrendous performances by Willis, Madsen, Michael Clarke Duncan (who was completely miscast) and the like, Mickey Rourke (of all people), pulls a heck of a turn as steel-jawed Marv out of a hat and makes his portion of this incredibly disjointed movie, not only bearable, but enjoyable. You felt for Marv. You wanted him to succeed, the dark, sick, potentially mentally unstable killer that he was. Marv had a motivation for what he did. You understood his love for Goldie and how it could push him to seek retribution for her death, even if Marv had only known her for a matter of hours. Rourke's turn as Marv was that subtle and nuanced, even when deeply submerged in unbridled violence. Unfortunately, that was the true tragedy of the film. Rourke's performance gave you just enough hope that the movie would improve and become somewhat palatable that you were able to summon enough courage to suffer through all the way to the end.<br/><br/>Grade: D-plus (And it would have been an ""F"" but at least the visuals were interesting - and Rourke's performance alone is worth raising this thing an entire grade). But as a final note to the directors (yes, that's plural - Frank Miller and Robert Rodriguez shared the title of Director while Quentin Tarantino co-directed), comic books should be adapted to movies. Movies should not be moving comic books. The visual concept was interesting for the first ten minutes of the film and then was just annoying. Audiences actually enjoy films that are more than line drawings with a single splash of color thrown in for effect."

","I wanted to like this movie so bad. I'm a big fan of Robert Rodriguez. I must say I've never read or even heard of the Sin City comics. Other than Batman/Superman I'm pretty much out of my league. If I had liked the comics maybe i would have understood the direction Rodriguez took the film. From what I've heard he was just being true to the comic series.<br/><br/>The black & white film with amazing color spotted here and there was very different and welcomed. Most people have a complaint about the violence, cannibalism and pedophile in the movie. It really didn't go into any detail on any of those. It's not a comic kids should be out there reading and the movie is rated R therefore I don't really see what the problem was.<br/><br/>The problems I had with the film where the comic book backgrounds(once again I not a comic reader & i didn't enjoy that), sometimes corny dialog and excessive narration as if reading the thought box above a characters head in a comic book(again not a comic reader & didn't enjoy that). Putting all that together and it was just a little too much for me. The movie seemed like a comic book on screen which I think was the point but it got lost to this viewer.<br/><br/>On the plus side this movie had an amazing cast. It's beautiful to the eyes. It has some great scenes here and there. There are many wonderful characters in the film. I can see why the comics are so popular. Mickey Rourke was outstanding in the movie. I loved the character and him in it.<br/><br/>3 of 10"
"Dired","2","2","4","15 August 2005"," Show, don't tell
","In comics, the overuse of exposition enables the static images to gain a kind of movement that wouldn't otherwise have, adding a kind of life to them. We don't read the words out loud - they would sound ridiculous - but instead internalize them as we read them, creating a delusion of action. Try it; read your favorite comics out loud, listening to how the words play and flow - it's awful. But that's a function of the additional role that exposition has to serve in a motionless book as much as the juvenile nature of most of them. Yet in Sin City, we actually hear that, and it goes from stylized to moronic to hysterical to pathetic in only a few scenes - it's the wrong tool for the wrong job, and the actual inherent quality of it is therefore irrelevant.<br/><br/>Sin City proves this with a vengeance. As a result, the dialog becomes absolutely wince-inducing, sounding like something a 12-year-old boy would write as he dreamed of tough guys and sexy girls. Nuance, subtlety, even innuendo are completely absent - that's thinking stuff, not action and thrills! It's like taking film noir, eliminating the ""boring parts"" (that is, boring to the child in us), ramping up the action to Bugs Bunny levels, and, well... waiting for nothing to happen.<br/><br/>Comic readers like to convince themselves the medium is actually mature and intelligent, rather than the pre-teen fantasies of adequacy their detractors claim. What is remarkable about Sin City is both sides come about absolutely convinced their case has been proved beyond question. As someone who feels the direct translation of a comic to a film is utterly misguided, I have to side with on the latter."

","For the first 10 minutes or so the awesome visuals in this film completely blew me away, and I was prepared to really love it. The imagery and attention to detail was excellent. Really liked the fact that they had managed to recreate the comic book images. But....then I got bored. I like films to be visually interesting (it is a visual medium after all) - but there needs to be something more to it than that - either interesting story, thought provoking idea or attention grabbing dialogue. This film does not have it - and i found the ""cleverness"" of th visuals distracting - there are only so many times you can think ""gosh I'm impressed by this"". Then I started to find it repetitive - same images / same lack of story and same (admitedly cool the first time) ultra violence. The incessant use of voice over (to try and explain what was happening) was too much. So by the end my abiding emotion was boredom and frustration. So if you need some story or message this film will not sustain interest. There are great visuals, but for me that wasn't enough. I wish someone would make as awesomely visually interesting a film of a graphic novel / comic with more to say for itself - series of Sandman films anyone?"
"teejpa4","8","2","4","24 July 2005"," The best way to make comics to movies!
","Sin City is fully based on Frank Miller's graphic novels - series of Sin City. The movie's story is from three albums, 1st, 3rd and 4th. Visually the movie looks perfectly like the graphic novels. Black and white picture and only some certain things are coloured. Like characters eyes or spilling blood. The cast is another perfect thing in Sin City. The actors look just like in Sin City stories. For example Alba is fantastic Nancy, Willis living image of Hartigan and Mickey Rourke is true Marv. They did everything to make the movie look like Miller's comics and they succeeded in it. Only one bigger thing is different. In Sin City novels when a story ends another begins but in the movie they put two a bit smaller main stories between the biggest story's beginning and end part. Why this when everything else is just like in graphic novels. And about directing. Roberto Rodriguez can make very different kind of movies. In Sin City Rodriguez's mark is best visible even though the script is strongly guided by Miller's comics. Q. Tarantino is mentioned as a special guest director. It's like a mark from the film makers that ""this is a really good movie"". Knowing Rodriguez and Miller's Sin City, they wouldn't need it. This sells even if it wasn't marked with film directing's biggest name."

","The words of Homer Simpson sum up my feelings for Sin City, the new grossly overrated film from grossly overrated director Robert Rodriguez.<br/><br/>I haven't read the graphic novels by Frank Miller, so I can't tell whether the film stays true to the original or not. What I do can tell you is that the movie sucks.<br/><br/>The visual style is compelling, but after being awestruck for the first five minutes, you start to concentrate on the content of the movie, and now is when disappointment strikes.<br/><br/>You feel absolutely NOTHING for the characters, who are no more than caricatures, and NOT in a good way. Why should I care if a character makes it or not when I have no feelings for him or her? It's not that the characters are ""bad"" or ""too violent"" or ""despicable""; it's just that I don't care for them.<br/><br/>This movie takes itself waaaay to seriously, which is a huge mistake, considering the shoddy acting, poor directing and ""flaccid, sloppy writing"", to quote Robert McKee i ""Adaptation"".<br/><br/>The extensive use of voice over gets pretty old after a while, and good old Robert McKee says it best when he says: ""Any idiot can write a voice-over narration to explain the thoughts of a character."" A studio executive once told me how he knew a movie was bad if he looked at his watch at any time during the screening. I could not stop looking at my watch while watching Sin City. I longed for the end credits to roll.<br/><br/>This movie might have been good as a short or a music video, considering it's visual style, but it's just not good enough to cut it as a feature film."

I could capture the feel of garbage on film, but I don't think that many people would be running to the box-office (except maybe garbage-men). The only reason this film is rated so high is because people that are OBSESSED with comic books WORSHIP it. It pulls it off so well because it is so unbelievable corny. Last time I checked ""X-Men"" wasn't up for a Pulitzer Prize. The funny thing is, the only people that respect comic books are the people that read them. Everyone else views them as juvenile. I mean come on! Can't you people strive for something a little deeper! Why not praise a film for trying to capture the ""feel"" of a ""book""? I know that they don't have all the cool pictures in them, but they are still pretty good. Stand back and look at it. What kind of emotions did the stories in this film try to evoke?

"DICK STEEL","10","2","4","10 July 2005"," A Nutshell Review: Frank Miller's Sin City
","The long wait is over. After 5 long months, Sin City has finally made it to our shores, passed uncut. And watching it somehow brought a smile to my face, not that I'm extremely pleased with the gratuitous violence and nudity, but because it stuck to the source material so well, you feel as if you're reading the book and hearing the audiotape (if there is one) at the same time.<br/><br/>For the uninitiated, the Sin City comics consists of various story lines, some of which are adapted for the screen. Created by Frank Miller, he also serves as co-director, which probably explains that this big screen adaptation is as faithful as you can get.<br/><br/>I've read The Hard Goodbye, and watching that segment on screen, wow, every narrative dialogue and monologue, every scene in the book is right there on screen. The action and violence too, every frame adapted the look and feel of the book. Heck, even Marv (Mickey Rourke) looked the part, thanks to prosthetics. Jaime King rocked as Goldie, his goddess, while Elijah Woods rounded off the cast for this segment as Kevin, the chillingly fast and deadly killer.<br/><br/>The other major story lines consisted of That Yellow Bastard and The Big Fat Kill, which I have been slow in picking up, but after viewing the movie now, you bet they'll be added to my comics collection soon. The stories are presented as a whole, so there is no intercut scene which brings you from one storyline to the next, and no confusion. Timelines in which the stories happen however, follows the books, so at some points you might see certain scenes and characters from other story lines.<br/><br/>Casting is wickedly accurate, with the likes of Bruce Willis, Jessica Alba, Clive Owen, Rosario Dawson, Benecio Del Toro, Carla Gugino, Nick Stahl, Alexis Bledel, Devon Aoki, Michael Clarke Duncan, the list goes on. Most of the look like their comic book counterparts, which is simply amazing. The only inaccuracy I can spot is with Alba's character staying clothed in the movie (heh). Too many characters? No worries - the opening credits shows the character as drawn from the book, together with the actors name. So far, only Spider-Man 2 made use of comic book panels in its opening credits (drawn by Alex Ross).<br/><br/>For those with weak stomachs, you might want to think twice watching the show. Most of the violence are shown on screen, but the lack of colours (it's black and white, like the books) somehow cushions the splattering of fresh blood. You have mutilations, shootouts, decapitations, castrations, explosions and the likes. The technique used in Sin City is similar to that used in Sky Captain, and all the backgrounds do not really exist.<br/><br/>If you like Kill Bill, you'll probably enjoy Sin City too, shot and cut by Robert Rodriguez, with Quentin Tarantino having a hand in directing one of the scenes. Fans will probably clamour for a sequel (Marv+Dwight in tag team action in A Dame To Kill For?), I know I would too!"

","SIN CITY is a joy to watch, especially for fans of the original graphic stories. Its a guilty pleasure though, with such over the top violence, and women out of a geek fan boy's wildest dreams, you have to wonder if you should be enjoying it so much. Thank goodness such a wild movie can still be made in such politically-correct days as these. As a movie it's hard to really rate it so highly, but this film can't be judged like other movies, this is a new strange cinematic beast. I give it 10 for the sheer audacity of the film-makers. If only Kubrick were alive to play with these new cinematic toys, what on Earth would he conjure up? These digital/green-screen/cgi movies are the future, it seems, and hopefully a new generation of Kubricks will flex their muscles on the brave new cinematic world ahead.

I have to admit until this film was released I hadn't heard of Frank Miller. I hear that he has two Sin City sequels planned, if they are as good as Sin City 1 I can't wait.<br/><br/>The characters lives are all intertwined so that the way in which the story comes to life is fantastic. Quentin Tarantino having a role in its making as special guest director does not surprise me. I'd like to know how much of an influence he had with Miller as it seemed to me that you could see his direction and mannerisms in every part of the movie.<br/><br/>The primary character is Marv (Mickey Rourke), for some reason this guy does not know when to give up; this is one of his traits in the movie that endears you to him. He's a typical bad looking guy with a big heart who deals with his enemies with equally big fists. He also seems to have a penchant for jackets.<br/><br/>From what I can make out the secondary and tertiary characters are Police Detective Hartigan (Bruce Willis) and Dwight (Clive Owen), Willis is typical Willis and did not do anything for me. Clive Owen on the other hand with his menacingly calm way of dealing with people in the movie again was a treat.<br/><br/>Jessica Alba is given billing ahead of Clive Owen in the credits however I can't think why given her short but without exception, excellent appearance.<br/><br/>From start to finish the action grabs you, that it is mainly shot in black and white certainly added to my enjoyment of the movie. Elijah Wood plays a character called Kevin, his purpose in the movie is quite strange, he seems to be a kind of hybrid apathetic killing machine, I never did quite find out what he was, human, robot, whatever? The late Rutger Hauer has a small but central part in the story as Cardinal Roark, the family of this name seems to run everything in Sin City and its environs. There are many other first rate actors, too many to mention.<br/><br/>It's one of those movies that don't look much until you've watched it, having watched it many times since I would definitely recommend it."

As I am only fifteen and I come from a country, where books like that aren't widely spread, I haven't read the comic book.

Now I am really interested in finding the book somewhere in the Internet and learning more about thy mystery of ""Sin City"". I can only express my admiration for the actors work. I can say that they have done their best to make the characters become alive in your mind. The best idea here is, nevertheless, the black-and-white shapes of everything. And the few colors added - the cherry on the top of the cake (that's how we say in Bulgaria). That is why I can recommend this film to anyone who is interested in finding out some new things about himself, who wants to take notice of its wisdom and, of course, who can cope with some red, yellow and black-and-white blood."

The three men have run ins with others notables like Jessica Alba, Nick Stahl, Elijah Wood, Rosario Dawson, Benicio Del Toro, and many more. All with qualities that define themselves, just like a comic book or graphic novel character in this case.<br/><br/>The color choices are interesting.

I have had a feeling, as thought I have watched 2 hours a decadent painting, a brutal one, with no hope for the people depicted in.<br/><br/>Does such pictures make our life better? Probably the authors & Tarantino think so, but every spectator is to have its own point of view, weather it is worth seeing & on this way supporting its producing.<br/><br/>The art without moral & ethic does not deserve to exist."

","This film is made for the fans of the comic or free violence, otherwise it is an absolute little crap.I didn't know of the comic and I found this film absolutely boring. After 30 minutes I could expect everything that was happening.The plot is dull and monotonous. Only one-dimensional characters and blood everywhere, this film is unfortunately at the same level as a Steven Seagal afternoon TV flick. I am so tired of bad guys who never die and good guys who are impenetrable to bullets and fall in love with hot semi-naked chicks with the intelligence of a chicken.<br/><br/>However I do appreciate other aspects of the film such as cinematography, and visual effects. The cast is good, but their lines are so crappy. As I said, if you like the comic, or juicy, gory violence, this is your movie. I went with a friend to see it, thinking about the interesting settings, the atmosphere and the stellar cast, and I ended up quite disappointed with this gruesome feast."
"marcin_kukuczka","3","2","4","11 June 2005"," Decide to see SIN CITY and you will find anything, absolutely anything concerning VIOLENCE
","I have never been a particular fan of comics, but I went to see this movie because a lot has been said about it before its Polish premiere (definitely more praise than criticism). Some movie fans and critics said that it is, though strikingly similar, better than Tarantino's PULP FICTION (1994) being an authentic interpretation of Miller's comics on screen, some others did not hesitate to claim that it is one of the best movies of the 21st century among the ones already made and the ones that will be made in the next decades. What I saw was, in my opinion, one of the most violent and horrific films that I have ever encountered. I dare claim that the content of this film is not that far from hell.<br/><br/>SPOILERS: The first 30-40 minutes appear to be not that bad, the action truly keeps attention and the viewer is driven to the gloomy atmosphere. Later, however, the movie becomes an unrestrained depiction of various sorts of violence, from shooting and dragging through strangulation, hanging, masochistic passions, electric chairs, rapes, drowning, a disgusting desire for blood among women, even cannibalism, REAL DECADENCE IN THE VERY MEANING OF THE WORD. The worst thing in it is that Mr Miller will justify the graphic violence saying that the comics is violent so the movie must be also, but what is the sense in writing such brutal stories? No one seems to care for the psyches of the people who read them or watch such a violent movie?<br/><br/>But, it would be too subjectivist of me not to see its good sides. Yes, I admit that the black and white colors do make an effect. The atmosphere is intensified by the wonderful music, by John Debney and others, which leads to the very core of a sin city where you can find anything. In this case, the movie is like a temptation that leads to something dangerous. Some artistic features are, indeed, a strong point for the film and force the viewer to curiosity throughout.<br/><br/>The cast also give fine performances. I particularly liked Mickey Rourke in the role of Marv. The girls also did a good job, including Devon Aoki as Miho, a perfect killer, and Jaime King as Goldie and later Wendy; however, the idea of a woman presented here is totally unacceptable for me. The movie shows a tragic distortion of human being, but probably therefore, it is a sin city, and, most obviously, a sin movie...<br/><br/>But honestly speaking, if you decide to see SIN CITY, be prepared for a truly disgusting graphic violence, murders, puddles of blood, simply anything possible on earth and perhaps in hell. It is a movie for people with very strong character. If it is seen only as an entertainment (strange entertainment, indeed), it is not that harmful. However, if the content of the movie affects the life of a person in any sense, even in an unconscious way, then it would have been better if there had never been such comics and such a movie whatsoever. You never know when it harms you as no one knows himself/herself entirely. 3/10!"

","But this was just the comic come to life - how could I love it and hate the movie? Well, it's life, Jim, and not as we know it. The ridiculous hard-boiled goes over well on paper, but as soon as someone starts to read it word for word, oh dear. Which brings me to my next point: this whole green-screen acting thing has got to go. The actors don't understand it, and can't work with it. The action wasn't all that good either. I always imagined Dwight with the athleticism of a cat. Rodriguez can't bring that to life. Nor can he and Rourke brink the enormous hulk that ought to be Marv to the screen convincingly. Just looked like an ordinary guy in a mask. Some of it looked good, some of it so-so.<br/><br/>I'll stick with bringing it to life in my head."

","I've never read the original comics by Frank Miller, but the noirish ads for this looked delicious enough to make me long to see it. Very ""Gotham Cityesque"", moody black and white photography, a fairly exciting cast, and the semi-involvement of Quentin Tarantino, one of the greatest filmmakers on the job today for my money.<br/><br/>So what went wrong? Everything but the visuals. SIN CITY is extremely cool to look at and wonderfully captures the world of the comics, but that's pretty much it. Only one of its three vignettes is interesting, that being the one with an unrecognizable Mickey Rourke as the hulking brute Marv, who's on a mission to track down whoever was responsible for killing the prostitute he was sweet on. The other two stories (one with Bruce Willis, another with Clive Owen) are not nearly as involving. Even less effective is that the three tales don't mesh together by the time it's all over (and that takes forever). Action aplenty, but so much of it all over the place that it gets repetitious instead of thrilling. Performance-wise, Rourke is good (though some of that is due to his extreme makeup), but Willis seems to be phoning this one in. Elisha Wood appears ridiculous, and hottie Jessica Alba's acting is ... well, ...Jessica Alba's a hottie... ** out of ****"
"movieguy1021","9","2","4","29 April 2005"," Sin City: 9/10
","I wasn't really cognizant of the release of Pulp Fiction, as I was at the age of six. But I can see how it could have changed the history of cinema and how it effected the times. And when fanboys all over the USA heard about Sin City, based on three of Frank Miller's cult graphic novel series, they all clamored that it would be the next Pulp Fiction. Why would these people say that? Maybe it's how the ads plastered ""Guest Director Quentin Tarantino"" all over the place. Or maybe it's because it has a similar ""neo-noir"" style. Or maybe even the three-intersecting-storyline aspect. Whatever the case may be, Sin City turned out to not be the next Pulp Fiction. But it's just about as cool.<br/><br/>Sin City's comprised of three stories which all take place in Basin City, or Sin City, where prostitutes and hit men are rampant all over the streets. In ""The Hard Goodbye,"" Marv (Mickey Rourke), after sleeping with Goldie (Jaime King), finds her dead and goes on a rampage to avenge her death. In ""The Big Fat Kill"", Dwight (Clive Owen) helps out a bunch of prostitutes reclaim the streets from the cops. And in ""That Yellow Bastard"", Hartigan (Bruce Willis) goes to find Nancy (Jessica Alba), whom he saved years earlier from a man who's been colored yellow (Nick Stahl) after Hartigan...rendered him useless. Actually, there's a short fourth story as the bookends to the movie from ""The Customer is Always Right"" with Josh Hartnett.<br/><br/>If there could be one clichÃ© phrase to describe Sin City, it would be ""style over substance."" Shot almost entirely in black and white (save for some well-placed color images), and with computer generated backgrounds (like Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow, except people saw Sin City), it looks great. It looks almost exactly like Miller's graphic novels, including some segments with pen-and-ink graphics to completely replicate Miller's novels. Anyone who dislikes Sin City says that it didn't have enough story. But when you see the trailers, you know that this is what you're getting. You're getting the best-looking movie of the past few years. It's better than all of these so-called ""advancements"" in CGI. It does for visual film-making what Peter Jackson's Braindead did for blood.<br/><br/>Of course, there's also no denying the absolute...coolness of the plot. It's a complete guy's movie: every female character is either a prostitute, stripper, has a nude scene, or a combination of all three. All of the guys have guns and kill and torture people. It's almost like an old-time Western, or something like that, except with more blood and female nudity. The way that the plot is connected is done in a very cool way, with a little connection between them all. And we can't forget about director Robert Rodriguez's ultra cool direction. With Rodriguez, there's never a dull moment in the film. It's a non-stop ride, which is already getting me excited for Sin City 2 and 3.<br/><br/>All of the actors were great in portraying their tough-as-nails characters. The standouts, though, were Owen and Benecio Del Toro (who was also in ""The Big Fat Kill""). They're just the coolest characters, played by two of the best modern actors. Their standout scene is the scene that Tarantino directed, with the two of them in a car. That scene can basically sum up the whole movie. It's absurd, violent, weird, and absolutely bloody fantastic.<br/><br/>My rating: 9/10 Rated R for sustained strong stylized violence, nudity and sexual content including dialogue."

","Sin City is a worthless film. I had high hopes for this film. The cast looked impressive, I like the director, and I had heard good things about the movie.<br/><br/>But this film is a series of senseless violence. There is no purpose or moral to the story. For that matter, there is no story. Two thirds of the film have no point, other than to show those two characters sitting beside one another at a bar. <br/><br/>It has no hero. Everyone is evil. Honestly, my time would have been better spent if I had watched an old Friday the 13th film.<br/><br/>This is one of the first bad reviews that I have ever written.

"jay632","5","2","4","11 April 2005"," I film that is different
","I went to watch this movie based on hype. I had no idea Sin City used to be a comic. People posted some links about the trailer of this movie, so I watch the trailer, and i was like wow, this is different, so i went to watch the movie.<br/><br/>Spoilers plot: I'm a big believer in a good plot, no matter how bad the movie, a good plot could win me over, I didn't like the plot of this movie. I didn't know that this movie would split into 3 plots. I thought Bruce Willis was the main character throughout the movie, but he was not. So at the end of his scene, I was like, where did he go? And i thought in the second plot, the guy was still Bruce Willis, but he was not, i don't read the comic, so I had no clue. The film then splits into two more separate plots before returning to Bruce Willis plot. I'm thinking this was done to show what Sin City was like through three different views through three different people how bad Sin City is. One things I don't understand was, look, i know its a comic though, but why does some guys get shot 15 times, and nothing happen to them, while some get hit once and there dead. And why is he hurt by gunshot on some scenes and seems to be immune to gunshot on other scenes? This includes some of the main characters, some scenes, they get right up after being shot. Oh yeah, one of the other strange things that bother me, was the characters saying cheesy lines, like, ""i'll get em for you, i'll get em good"" maybe not exactly those words, but there were a lot of those lines in the movie, for comic relief? i don't know.<br/><br/>Acting: The acting was OK I guess. I felt the guys did a pretty good job. The girls in the movie didn't real do anything for me, especially Britney Murphy, Alexis Bledel, it just didn't seem right.<br/><br/>Sound: Well, its hard to comment on this, seeing that most of the sounds were from gun fire, the visual effects made up for it I guess. The trailer for this movie was done nicely with music.<br/><br/>Visual effects: My comments have been pretty tough on this movie, but I still gave the movie 5 stars because, I felt the movie showed some nice visual effects. Its different to see a black and white film, with all these film these days from Disney and Pixar showing you all these vibrant colors. Color is added to certain objects in this movie only to add to the scene, which i felt looked pretty cool."

No connection between any of the characters. I was starting to fall asleep. And people keep saying that the action/violence of this film was so great(as in a lot) obviously haven't seen a good hong Kong film like ""Fulltime Killer"". There was even no REAL connection between the 2 killers. And the best actor of the whole movie I thought was King Arthur. Pretty bad I think. Jessica Alba wasn't even in the whole movie!! Come on....

Make no mistake, this stuff comes straight from the fevered masturbatory fantasies of your average 14 year old.<br/><br/>This isn't necessarily even the fault of the film makers, it comes about naturally from following so closely to the comics. Unfortunately, slavish devotion to an already adolescent comic book does not equal quality.

","I love the film Noir of the move; the characters were interesting however the movie as a whole could not keep my interest. There were many good story lines (that I wanted more detail on) but they were not used to their full potential. The choppy story line felt like I was watching it on DVD on fast forward, leaving out the foundation and substance of the story lines. This movie would have been better if they would have focused on fewer characters leaving room for a possible trilogy if wanting to go that route.<br/><br/>The acting was bad due to poor direction, at times the actors/actress' seem to look confused as to where they should be focusing their skills toward. I would have to compare much (not all) of the acting in this movie to be that of a low budget no name B movie. Many minute details where over emphasized leaving some of the more important details to be lost in the shadows.<br/><br/>I was very disappointed with the movie, I can handle slow but the lack of dialog, direction and substance made this a movie that I would only recommend seeing on cable or at the dollar theater."
"adrianmgarcia","3","2","4","10 April 2005"," 3 1/2 out of 10
","This movie is at the very least a half-hour too long. The multiple plots are unbalanced and I had little desire to put the pieces of the stories puzzle together. Midway through the movie I was hoping it would end quickly. I turned to a friend sitting next to me and said, ""This move refuses to end."" The voice-overs for the most part are monotone and dry. Yes the visuals are superb, maybe even unparalleled, yet it seemed as if the rest of the films elements took a back seat and the audience thrown out the window. A stellar cast could not save this movie, especially when those actors were not in peak form (Rosario Dawson and Clive Owen to name a pair). I really wanted to like this movie. I grew up a fan of comics and I'm a fan of some of the Tarentino style films (Pulp Fiction and Kill Bill). However, 10 minutes into the movie you get past the awe inspiring visuals and ask the movie to deliver more. In my humble opinion, it simply does not. It's a film that takes itself too seriously. It doesn't waste a chance to pat itself on the back. It thinks it's full of poetry when it is not. It assumes that people want to connect the dots and that they will be drawn into its dark characters. I simply did not care. I love great anti-hero's (The Stranger by Albert Camus). These guys, though, do not fall into that category. Lastly, what was the deal with the Nazi symbols? I'm not Jewish, but I was bothered by them. Whoever's idea it was, it simply didn't add anything to the movie other than have me think about the holocaust during the movie. Also, the film would have benefited form some of the cynicism towards the church around the time of the sex scandals rather than a period when the whole world is praising the recently deceased Pope. Unfortunate timing. I only mention this because I saw some people walk out. I also wanted to bail, but not because institutionalized religion gets linked to the world of sin (actually much deserved) but because the only corner I wanted to turn in Sin City was one leading out."

","Never before has a movie captured such action and style in the way that Sin City did. The visuals were both stunning and original. Sin City featured great acting from Bruce Willis, Clive Owen, Benicio Del Toro and Mickey Rourke. Each actor makes you forget any other character that they ever played. Bruce Willis became Hardigan and Clive Owen made me forget his sex-a-holic doctor from Closer as he became a great former criminal. This may slightly lend itself to the great vision laid down by Rodriguez and Miller. The 'Pulp Fiction' like story was fantastic and made me want to read some of Frank Miller's work. The film kept me grinning and jaw-dropped throughout with some witty humor showcased by Rourkes' character and also Del Toro's character (whom in one scene, while Owen drives, is a talking corpse that resembles a ""human pez dispenser"" and flip-flops voice tones as his head rolls around his shoulders). Another great aspect of the film which some people may find a flaw would be the unmerciful violence, but this makes the film a great 'guy movie' and added to my personal enjoyment of the film. Amazing work here from Rodriguez and Miller."
"Pavel-8","6","2","4","8 April 2005"," A finely crafted piece of garbage.
","With the most appropriate movie title in recent memory, ""Sin City"" is likely to be divisive among moviegoers, and more interestingly within a moviegoer. Rarely has such a dichotomy existed between technical prowess and moral & narrative bankruptcy.<br/><br/>""Sin City"" is an anthology of three stories set in the noir-ish, crime-riddled metropolis of Frank Miller's graphic novels (he also co-directed). Each segment has its own storyline with unique characters, although they do transpire simultaneously in the same space, running roughly parallel rather than criss-crossing. This gives the movie a fractured and episodic nature that limits its overall narrative power, inexplicably dragging despite its breakneck action and pace.<br/><br/>Shot by jack-of-all-trades Robert Rodriguez in sumptuous black-and-white, high-definition digital video, the movie was done largely in front of green screen, with flashes of color and cityscapes that are primarily CGI meshing seamlessly with the live action to produce some of the best and most pervasive visual effects ever seen. In the process, the sheer visceral look of the picture entrances, as each shot seems worthy of being frozen and hung on a wall due to the slightly out of kilter comic-book style framing. This careful craftsmanship and attention to detail plunges the audience so deep into an alternative world that it's almost enough to distract from the complete absence of any moral compass. Almost.<br/><br/>As fantastic and jaw-dropping as the visuals are, the principles of ""Sin City"" are equally heinous, emphasizing the dark side of the monochromatic world. There are no white-hat heroes, and even the protagonists are villainous. The only remotely good character is Bruce Willis's detective, who would fill the ""bad cop"" role in most worlds. But his aggressive approach, which is not by the book to say the least, falls on the tame end of the the movie's violent methods spectrum, which combines the bloodiness of ""Kill Bill"" with the brutality of ""The Punisher"". I can sometimes accept such actions if the motives are somewhat pure (the relatively justifiable homicides of either aforementioned movie for instance), but such motives here are minimal at best and predominantly non-existent.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong. I don't necessarily require high morality out of my movies. I'm not demanding the pure motives of Frodo or Atticus Finch, but give me something to latch onto, some semblance of a moral reference point. Someone like Kevin Bacon's flawed but justice-seeking cop in the murky crime drama ""Mystic River"", which was based in a right-and-wrong world even as it portrayed a darker side. Even a sliver of ethics will do, but there is nary a sliver to be found in ""Sin City"". Even people who are ""supposed"" to be good are likewise black-hearted. Without any sort of orientation, the movie stumbles over itself throughout. I realize that is the nature of the source material; and I accept that, commending Rodriguez and Miller for their cinematic vision, while simultaneously reeling from the depraved soul of the books.<br/><br/>With a cast of familiar names and faces that you can't count using your fingers and toes, the acting of ""Sin City"" is...well, it's there. No one except perhaps the disappointing Michael Madsen (who apparently thought he was still on ""Tilt"") detracts from the film, but no one is given much opportunity to supply good work either. Most of the parts are virtually interchangeable, requiring merely an attractive stone face. The casting and appearance are therefore all the more praiseworthy, as image overrides and dwarfs character development. Fortunately the celebrity never distracts from the movie, but rather produces an aura of respectability in what would likely have been regarded as an awful B-grade flick without such star power.<br/><br/>Despite my major ethical issues, I still find myself getting juiced whenever I espy artwork from the film. It looks that good. But I still don't recommend it. The bifurcated ""Sin City"" excels in every technical aspect, but the heart is cold, and the story is shattered.<br/><br/>Bottom Line: Like Snow White's polished apple, ""Sin City"" gleams on the outside, concealing a rotten core that ultimately disheartens and disappoints. 6 of 10 at best, exclusively for technical merit."

The use of color is clever and amazing. If I had to describe this movie in one word, it would be, crazy. The action is over-the-top and the decapitations are oddly beautiful.

","I had the misfortune to read several critics reviews of the movie before going in to see it and I was a bit worried. I heard things like bad dialogue, poor special effects, and too much violence. I had feared that perhaps, even though Frank Miller partially directed, that the movie would not stick to the graphic and well-written comics of the Sin City series. Why did I ever doubt!?! This movie was fantastic! First off, it's style is original and bold with a huge lot of characters performed by A-list actors that are well cast. Bruce Willis the best in my opinion although I suspect many moviegoers will choose Mickey Rourke's Marv as their favorite. There are no blurry CGI effects like you see in Star Wars and the most recent Sky Captain & the World of Tomorrow. Yes, you can see it's CGI, but it's only noticeable because it's supposed to look like the comic book - not real life. Rodriguez makes sure it's bold and bright and I give him major credit for pulling it off. My fiancé, a graphic designer, raved about the amazing shadow work - something I've never heard him do in the recent CGI films of the past few years.<br/><br/>As for those who dislike the dialogue I counter it was simply sticking to the source material. I would also say if you're unfamiliar with film noir you may be left cold. I am a fan of old Bogart films so I thought the wording was perfect. Sin City doesn't take place in modern day Earth - this is a dimension all to itself and it was written to be very detective-novel-esquire.<br/><br/>As for the violence, it's all there from the novels. I have to give Rodriguez props again for sticking to the source material and steering away from a cheesy 'Hollywood' ending. I loved every minute of the action.<br/><br/>Finally, this movie is a great film for the new anime female generation. The women of Sin City are amazingly strong and when I first read the graphic novels when I was in college I thought it was some of the best female characterizations I'd ever read. I'd say if you're a girl and hesitant to go see it, don't. It's portrayals of women are about a hundred times better than any of the more recent 'sci-fi' genre films.<br/><br/>I can't wait to see it again."
"Oskar_SW","10","2","4","7 April 2005"," I mean.....WOW!
","Sin City really delivers. This is by far one of the best and original film i have seen in a very long time. I had all ready reed the issues from Frank Miller and i all ready loved the idea of a place like Sin City already then. The movie is just as good as the comic, and Sin City is really alive on the movie screen. I have to take my hat of to all the actors who did a job very well done. The way the film looked is the thing i was most impressed by, they captured the very essence of Sin City.<br/><br/>So go see Sin City, it don't matter if you reed the comic a hundred time or not at all. It work very well either way.<br/><br/>10 out of 10."

","When I saw the trailer for this movie I thought it looked kind of interesting, but when I saw the movie, I was so confused through out the whole thing that I almost left the movie theater. I am not a comic book reader, I have never even heard of the comic Sin City. I was not impressed with this movie, I was bored, it was long, very gory, and to many characters to remember and remember there stories. The acting was OK but not great Bruce Willis, Jessica Alba, and Rosario Dawson did a pretty good job, but it wasn't that great. If you know the Sin City story and are a fan I think you would like it, but I didn't. I do have to say though this movie probably was the most like a comic book I have seen."

","Going into this movie, I had never seen, read, and barely heard of the comic ""Sin City"". After seeing this movie, I may just become a fan. ""Sin City"" sticks out among the poor to semi-poor rash of comic book movies over the past couple of years. While movies like ""The Hulk"", ""The Punisher"", and the X-Men series wrestle with each other in mediocrity, (and movies like ""Daredevil"", ""Elektra"", and the end of the Batman franchise wrestle for worst-ever title) this movie has outdone all in every possible fashion - including both Spiderman flicks (both of which were done very well). For starters, the movie looks like it has been drawn. Robert Rodriguez has now firmly established himself as a premier director, WHO GETS IT. Some directors may have taken a gem such as ""Sin City"" and decided to put their own stamp of what has been done (See: roller blading ""genius"" of Joel Shumacher in ""Batman and Robin""). Rodriguez understood what made ""Sin City"" a popular comic and embraced it. This embracement ends up in long shots of the characters; quick dialog ripped directly from the comics themselves; vibrant and distinct blacks and whites; and an overall ultra-cool feel which the movie easily conveys. The cast is great, with each character matching well. Mickey Rourke has finally returned, and as it turns out his character in ""Get Carter"" was horribly misplaced and now has resurfaced in ""Sin City"". The only downfall of this movie, and it is a minor one, is Jessica Alba. Alba's beauty is unquestionable, yet I wonder if her presence is such in real life that she can continually be touted as an up-and-coming star. This roll is clearly a juicy part, same as her roll in the upcoming ""Fantastic Four"", and yet the girl can not act a lick. Everything that comes out of her mouth sounds as if her acting coach was Jenna Jameson. MAHS BAHS' FIVE GREAT THINGS ABOUT ""SIN CITY"" 1. The selected color, such as the reds and people with green or blue eyes. 2. Will go down as one of the 10 greatest movies which encourage smoking of cigarettes, (number one still being ""Casablanca"") 3. The Ultraviolence Kubrick could only wish he had a chance to put into ""A Clockwork Orange"". 4. An interesting ""guest director"" credit for Tarantino, and you will recognize the Tarantino-stamped scenes. 5. Carla Gugino totally nude."
"Annakin","Null","2","4","2 April 2005"," Brilliance. Another masterpiece from one of the great artists of our time.
","Rodriguez has done it again. There are so very few movies made that show such a dynamic range of deep craft and passion. From the basics- story and performance- to the minutae of production design and inside jokes, this masterpiece is pure joy to watch. Films of this quality are tragically rare. The intertwining of 3 key stories from the Sin City novels was seamless. And and extra hurrah to the production of elegantly bowing out of the DGA's constraints and allowing 3 world class storytellers (Rodriguez, Tarantino and Miller) to all have their hand in the direction. With any luck, the success of Sin City will ensure that Watchmen will get made (fingers crossed- get to work Hayter, Levin and Gordon!).<br/><br/>Hopefully there will be a 5 hour DVD.<br/><br/>Thanks and praises to all who helped bring this masterpiece to the screen."
"phat-kid5","10","2","4","2 April 2005"," Best Comic based movie ever!!!
","OK, so the first thing that i have to say is WOW!! I went into the movie not knowing much, and was just absolutely blown away. Both technically and acting wise, this movie was superb. Watching the beginning, I knew that Robert Rodriguez directed it, and was happy, for, i liked From dusk till Dawn. But sitting in the theater i was very excited when i saw that Tarantino guest directed. So, for those of you who have not seen the movie, get ready, it definitely has Tarantino flavoring. Now, if you do not like Tarantino, don't not go see the movie. He brings to the screen an artistic side of things. That being said, the plot itself is very cool. It follows the lives of three people in BAsin City. It twists from cops, to old hit men, to defending prostitutes. And it does it with flair. The movie does run long, however, it is well worth it. For in during the duration of the movie, there are many many many one liners, that will, i promise, have you in stitches. So without further ado, i tell all of you, go spend the 8 bucks to see it. It will be money well spent."

","I went into Sin City with high expectations. I've been waiting 6+ months for this movie. I was blown away. The movie leaks style and coolness. The performances were top notch. Most notably Rourke as Marv. The black and white with color mixed it is just eye-popping. More often than not, I hype up a movie in my head and then, when i see the movie, are disappointed with it. Sin City was not the case. I loved every minute of it. I must caution everyone though. This might put some people off. This is the Sin City comics verbatim. This is the movie version of the comics. It's not like Spider-Man where they change a bunch of crap. The violence is like that which you'd find in a comic. Its over the top and plentiful here. I don't think there is one use of the f-bomb though. If you like movies, comics or both, Run to see this movie. RUN. YOUR NOT RUNNING! **** out of ****"

","I just saw this movie and it is one of the best I have ever seen! It's true to the material it is based on and makes me want more, more, more!! Why can't more movies be like this? I love some Alexis Bledel and Devon Aoki! Frank Miller, do more movies!!! The pace was quick and the style never ending. The casting was perfect especially with Mickey Rourke eating up every scene he was in. You just couldn't take your eyes off of his performance as Marv. Carla Gugino was also spot on but with limited screen time, which is understood if you have read the graphic novels. Clive and Bruce brought Dwight and Hartigan right off of the pages and I felt a compassion for them. Oh and of course Jessica Alba-- she is probably the most perfect woman on earth. Little Nancy Calahan....she grew up....she filled out...This movie my friends will keep audiences talking and wanting more for quite a while. 5 out of 5!"
"braindog","10","2","4","1 April 2005"," Absolutely Stunning
","""Walk down the right back alley in Sin City, and you can find anything"", and isn't that the truth. Sin City has everything a movie goer could want in a film. It has an amazing cast that portray their gritty characters with a distinctful hard edge and compassion, which is helped with a fantastic script. The movie is driven by the actors and their ability to make the audience feel as if though they are in the characters shoes as they describe with vivid details their emotions and conflicts, and the steps they mean to take to make things right.<br/><br/>But it's not only a script or a great cast that makes this new tale of love and revenge come full circle, it's the images. Each scene is painted or drawn just like the pages right out of Miller's comic book that the film is based off of. The black and white makes the mood feel more dark and desolate (as it should be) making the city feel more alive. With it's splashes of color, one can only vast in it's brilliance. The visuals to this movie are unlike any I have seen and they should be recognized.<br/><br/>The movie follows three stories that are interwoven by the characters passions and ambitions. They live in a city of power and murder and they seek what little honor or dignity they can find in such a dark place. The film open up with a sequence with Josh Hartnett and a beautiful women glowing with a red dress and rich red lips. Hartnett's narration of his thoughts are crucial and set the tone. He explains to this woman who is on the run that he is there for her, and that it's not her figure or face, but her eyes that attract her. Her holds a lighter near her cigarette and the flame fades her eyes to green, so that we may see the beauty. He tells he loves her and there's a whisper of the gun. Sin City in a nutshell.<br/><br/>Mickey Rourke play Marv, a large man with a beastly looking face and temper to match. he falls in love with a woman who treats him kindly, but she is murdered and he is framed for it. Marv's quest and story in the film is to find the truth behind the murder and set things straight. Rourke does an excellent job in this movie, which was surprising to me. He brings life to a man that lives to get his answers by violently interrogating men and viciously murdering them. He does this by constantly reminding himself why he does what he does, for the woman that treated him nice. <br/><br/>Clive Owen plays Dwight, who gets caught up in a kill that could shake a truce that keeps young women alive. His story is a little more shallow than the others, but the element that keeps it true is his willingness to see that none of the girls are hurt.<br/><br/>Then there is Bruce Willis, who play Hartigan, the one honest man in the whole city. He rescues a young girl, Nancy, from the harm an lunatic pedophile (Nick Stahl). But Stahl's character is connected. His father (Powers Boothe) is a Senator and takes his anger of what Hartigan left his son out on him, by making Hartigan look responsible for kidnapping all the children his son did. Hartigan spends eight years in prison, helpless to keep Nancy safe, for it becomes his only will. When he gets out, he knows what he must do and knows that whatever it is, it must keep Nancy (Jessica Alba) safe.<br/><br/>Sin City is one of the best movies of the year so far. It goes beyond the expectations of any mere action film and does it well. With a great story, strong cast, and amazing visuals, it will be easy to see why this film is absolutely stunning.<br/><br/>Four out of four stars."

"mcconaugheymatthew","8","0","0","12 March 2019"," Sin City (2005) Review- Is It Still Worth It, 15 Years Later?
","Nearly 15 years have passed since the release of the Sin City film. In this lengthy review we will analyse the film, and answer the following questions: A). ""Is it a good movie overall?"" B). ""Is it worth watching anyway?"" And C). ""Has it aged well?""... Let's Begin, without spoiling much.<br/><br/>The film consists of three major segments. It follows a non-linear storytelling style, which is almost reminiscent of Tarantino films. The first segment follows the story of Hartigan, a cop one day away from retirement, who saves a little girl from a perverted psychopath who happens to come from the state's most powerful family, and in return gets framed and falsely accused of numerous crimes he didn't commit. Eight years later he is released, and a mysterious figure hunts him and the now-young woman he once saved for unknown reasons.
The second segment is pretty much the main story of this film. It follows the story of Marv, a hulking tough guy with some serious issues, who wakes up one night after sleeping with a gorgeous woman to find her lying next to him dead and himself instantly framed for the murder. In the middle of a large conspiracy, confused and angry, Marv starts killing his way to the truth.
The third segment takes place after the previous two and follows the story of Dwight, a man who attempts to aid the working girls of Old Town in hiding the body of a cop they mistakenly killed, in order to avoid sparking a war between the girls and the police. But as it seems, there are more people involved as well.
And now, the verdict.<br/><br/>1). Let's start with the story and script. As someone who has also read the graphic novels, I say this: The books are far superior to the film. But the film is an insanely loyal adaptation. The stories are gripping, interesting and the narration describing each character's thoughts is great. The dialogues are lifted almost word-for-word from the comics, and they are brilliant even though at times corny and due to the film's style the actors delivering them might feel bland or apathetic. 8/10
2). The Heroes.
The main characters are not exactly heroic, except for Hartigan of course. Dwight is deep down a white knight but also a dirty criminal with questionable ethics, and a very troubled mind. Marv has some good inside him but he's mentally ill. Definitely. They all get fleshed out well, and we come to like each one in their own story. 9,5/10
3). The Villains.
The villains in Sin City are weird. And mostly just crooked rich brats who screw over the protagonists. Some shine, some don't. The writing on Frank Miller's part is really good but it could've been slightly deeper. 7/10
4). The Visuals and the Directing.
As far as directing goes, Robert Rodriguez and Frank Miller did a fantastic job. Pure genius. If the film is paused at any moment, it feels like a comic book panel. That's why the characters move and behave like they do. At times though it feels more cartoony than the comics. The visuals are great too, although based on today's standards some may seem outdated. The film isn't entirely black-and-white, as some scenes feature dim, desaturated colors, which I found to be in poor taste. What's nice though is that some things purposefully maintained colorful, like blood, or a red dress, etc etc. 8/10
-So let's answer the questions.-
Q: Is it a good movie overall?
A: ""Good"" is subjective. It's all taste, really. But it's really well made and stylized and the directing as well as the writing are okay if you like this type of film. Though the cartoony manner in which many things happen in the film, such as the action and the violence, may make it hard for the viewer to take the film seriously.
Q: Is it worth watching anyway?
A: If you're not easily brought down by dark and depressing themes, if you're not offended by certain abbreviations, nudity and profanity, and if you have a strong stomach, I definitely recommend checking it out at some point.
Q: Has it aged well?
A: Some moments will look laughably bad today, some others may feel like a really good cutscene from a PS3 game. But it's still watchable, and highly enjoyable. Today's standards are very low when it comes to anything other than visuals, and this film exceeds them.<br/><br/>8/10"
"galkfirgd","9","0","0","9 March 2019"," Some Hyper Film Noir Mythology
","The Foundation:
Anyone who studied cinema in any capacity had to watch some of Hollywood's classic Noir films and their French origins. They always packed a punch and dropped you into an alternate reality of deadly woman, intense protagonists and murder mysteries.<br/><br/>Sin City is a modern caricature of the aforementioned Noir tropes and an almost roided up version of all the classic elements.
Taking three different stories and protagonists this movie follows the comics to an unprecedented amount of accuracy.
The Graphic Noval is essentially used as the film's storyboard, adding camera movements only when appropriate and adapting Frank Miller's harsh and brutal world and art style with such attention to detail that is rarely seen in any modern Marvel movie.<br/><br/>Overview:
If you can handle hilghy stylized violence, extremely intense dialogues and brutal action: Sin City delivers bone cracking punches, themes and pistol shots to the dick.<br/><br/>If Sin City was an object it be a highly ornamented, black coated Zippo lighter. A bit of an overkill on the classic silver models of the good old days. It was designed with the same functionality of the originals but is ordained with every sharpy motorcycle buckle and is used to light both cigarettes, gas tanks and humans.<br/><br/>Cast:
No one was payed a lot of money in this production yet everyone delivers their A game.<br/><br/>Mickey Rourke was born to play Marv. The half tank half gladiator of the franchise. He gives Marv such depth of character that he makes you sympathize with this hulking, bleeding husk of a person.<br/><br/>Clive Owen's performance might seem to be the weakest of the bunch but I believe it had more to do with being in the middle ground story of the three. Some lines are just too cheesey to be taken seriously and I can't fault the actor for doing his best with the source material.<br/><br/>Bruce Willis gives his last good performance, meaning that Sin City was the last film I saw this guy act. Behind the scenes Bruce explained that a few minutes after seeing the test footage Rodriguez showed he was immediately asked to be apart of the film. It's obvious he enjoyed the role and his story is what ends the movie with a punch to the gut in what is the most powerful ending of the three stories. Ending on a bitter Noir note that couldn't be more appropriate.<br/><br/>Every other actor gives a solid performance and as always Rutger Hauer elevates any movie he's in if even for a few short scenes.<br/><br/>Soundtrack:
Rodriguez worked alongside some talented people to compose a dark, harsh Noir atmosphere with a rusty Saxophone and Bass guitars, the soundtrack takes you into the black and white world of Sin City and let's you feel its roughness throughout.<br/><br/>Summary:
This film was made before the comic book revolution and its interesting to think how much better this movie could have been received today after the success of Deadpool.
I'm always attracted to films that don't feel formulaic. You'd be stressed to find a more loyal adaptation of a comic/graphic book or novel.
This isn't Marvel or DC, this is something else and I only wish more movies like this existed. It's truly creative and celebrates it's source material to an impeccable degree."

","3 April 2005. This amazing looking film attempts to introduce graphic cartoon/novels into live action and does so very successfully along with an unfortunate Pulp Fiction interplay of various independent plots that is less than successful. This raw, intensely, graphic violent film replicates in great detail the actual feel and visceral experience of a adult film noire cartoon (the best to date, setting a new level of qualitative black and white retro film-making). This is a movie with male testosterone and male honor with a big, big heart. It explodes off the screen (not page) with a punch that hits to the core. However, one wonders how much more powerful the movie would have been if it had actually followed a linear comic book line instead of interspliced scenes. The movie successfully exploits the emotional buttons as well as the over-the-top rampage of devastation that is rarely allowed on the screen R-Rated through probably deletion of the most obscene scenes (with most of it directly suggested). This movie also is reminiscent of the physical mayhem in Clock-Work Orange. Seven out of Ten Stars - could have been a complete knockout, but it threw in a few too many punches."
"MihaiSorinToma","8","0","0","22 January 2019"," A gem in terms of visuals
","In a city filled with corruption, we follow a couple of stories which present some impressive characters and their acts as they try to raise and overcome their condition in order to reach a higher purpose.<br/><br/>It's an unique movie which has a very interesting artistic direction. Everything is presented in a cartoonish or comic-book-ish black and white with a couple of colors like a stringent red or yellow being inserted from time to time for a different contrast. Visually speaking, this one looks spectacular. I really enjoyed and I also appreciate the way things have gone in this department.<br/><br/>In terms of plot, things aren't so spectacular. It's a great idea to present multiple sub-stories which might even intertwine at some point but I was left the feeling that it could have been a bit better. Its characters are good, quite well thought and presented, each with their own special traits. They do a good job in maintaining the suspense and thrill while also providing a good time through the exaggerated killings and fighting scenes in which they appear, but I can't quite escape the predictability and the overall feeling of superficiality. Everything gets sorted quite easy so you don't get feel something truly dramatic, especially when you tend to expect it to go in a way or another. You do get a couple of surprises along the way though, so it doesn't follow the same tone every single time, but still... Don't get me wrong, it's not bad; even far from it. I was just left a bit disappointed by this part of the film as it isn't on par with the visuals which were simply impressive.<br/><br/>The cast is a big plus for this movie, almost every single actor doing a very good job in impersonating its character, thus making them credible and even likable. The dialog is ok. Nothing groundbreaking but it's good enough to tie it all up. Another plus here would be the way each character presents its situation, its state and even the events which happened.<br/><br/>It's a movie which left me with some mixed feelings. It had a great presentation, a wonderful visual part, very well thought and implemented, a very good cast but with a plot which wasn't on par with the other parts. I know that you might be taken away by its action sequences, by its exaggerations or by its visuals, but for me the plot is by far the most important. Thus, you have to have an equally impressive plot in order to obtain a flawless movie. It a good plot, but far from impressive."

","Nobody ever thought that Sin City, a graphic novel by Frank Miller could ever be adapted to the big screen. It was very stylishly done, often with very little in the frame, mostly black and white with color only being added to heighten certain things. So it was considered next to impossible to do. Until Robert Rodriguez filmed a short little scene showing how it could look and the effect was immediately nothing short of breathtaking.<br/><br/>The city is done in tones of black and grey with harsh angles and actors digitally inserted into it. In some cases the actors, though appearing together in the scene, actually filmed their scenes solo and were just composited together later. It makes for a really interesting look. But looks aside, how good is the movie itself?<br/><br/>It's very well done and told through the eyes, and the voiceovers, of the main actors. You have Bruce Willis as the hard boiled cop, framed for something he didn't do, to protect a young girl. You have Clive Owen as a man protecting his girlfriend from a crooked cop. And you have, who is arguably the best character in the movie. Mickey Rourke as Marv a tough as nails bruiser who's trying to solve a murder of a woman he loved. All three stories intertwine to a certain degree.<br/><br/>And since it was filmed in black and white, like the comic, color is only used when necessary. Like the character of Roarke Jr a.k.a the ""Yellow (word that IMDB won't let me write but refers to somebody who's parents were never married)"" who is yellow through and through. Or the stunningly blue eyes of Alexis Bledel's character Becky. But the blood and the the gore? It's pure white. So those that have an aversion to it usually aren't bothered by it.<br/><br/>The movie was a critical and box office success which eventually led to other movies being done in the same way. But ""The Spirit"" and more importantly the sequel ""Sin City 2"" just didn't have the magic that this movie did."

","First and foremost, if it weren't for the visual effects ""Sin City"" would be nowhere; however, the visuals are absolutely gripping. The material itself is dark. Not like new moon dark--more like 2000 feet below the earth cave dark. Frank Miller frankly paints an absurdly evil world, and I that I think he actually has pretensions of making some sort of points about actual life, but this film is far too extreme, simple-minded, and cartoonish to constitute a significant contribution to the western philosophical canon.. No matter how extreme the violence, and it's pretty awfully extreme, it has minimal emotional impact--it's pretty much like you're watching a movie, so to speak. If someone accused Miller of ""toxic masculinity"", I wouldn't be standing up to defend him. All of the women are so hot, you'd scald yourself just brushing up against them, and all of the guys (both good and bad) work out all of their problems with extreme violence. Not really a happy place, although I do have to say an exceptionally stylish one. The plot ties together brilliantly as the film moves along well. If it could just have been edited down around another 20-30 minutes , I would have tossed it an extra star or two. Unfortunately the unrelenting bleakness just wound up overwhelming my tender.sensibilities"

","Plot; Three tales crisscross in the hellish landscape of the titular town.<br/><br/>Though my initial visit to Sin City back in 2005 left me wanting, I've always felt compelled to revisit it thanks to its reputation as one of the all-time great comic/graphic novel film adaptations. What struck me this time were not the visuals--the film's calling card--but the pace. Though it runs a touch over 2hrs., it moves at a breathless clip. And by that I mean its narrative locomotion, as it's not action heavy. Oh there's a lot of violence, but it lacks anything really approaching a traditional Hollywood action scene. The aforementioned visuals are really immersive and director Robert Rodriguez and his team--like Zack Snyder w/his adaptation of Frank Miller's 300 a few years later--do a great job of bringing the graphic novel to life.<br/><br/>Of the three tales that make up the film, my favorite was the one focusing on Marv, played brilliantly by Mickey Rourke. His performance here is award-worthy and his tale is the most engaging. The middle story is fine, but suffers a bit by comparison. The third tale--which is a wrap around--ends things on a strong note, w/Bruce Willis giving one of the stronger performances of his career. If I had a criticism it would be that I think it would've worked better had the action and violence not been so stylized, though perhaps that's simply in keeping w/the book, which I haven't read.<br/><br/>Though I felt like I needed a shower after it was over, I did enjoy this return to Sin City and I leave w/a much greater appreciation for it this time around."

","Sin City can be summed up in one word, unique. It really is very unique. The cinematography and nature of it all is very different. It's based on a series of graphic novels. It's a film that's told in parts, it's not all one story, rather it's many different stories all wrapped up into one crazy film. <br/><br/>There are many different Hollywood stars that make up the cast here. The cast includes Bruce Willis, Clive Owen, Jessica Alba, Rosario Dawson, Brittany Murphy, Alexis Bledel, Mickey Rourke, Carla Gugino, Elijah Wood... and more. I can say that i really enjoyed the acting in this film, i was impressed by the strong performances given. The characters are all broken in some way, struggling with their own issues. This movies takes place in a city that has so many violent issues, and violent screwed up characters. The police force is mostly corrupt, and there are people that would rather kill you than look at you around every corner. It's definitely another world.<br/><br/>The visuals are all well done for sure, the film-noir look is cool and i enjoyed that style. The violence is appropriately graphic given the kinds of people that this film focuses on and the area it's set in. The writing is fine, I personally wasn't terribly impressed by it, it's really the acting and visuals that impressed me most. There are parts I enjoyed more than others.

","This is what we could call an accurate adaptation of a comic book into a movie. This is what it could be the best adaptation of something like this. It has many of the images similar to the comic ones and that's something very good.<br/><br/>It tells the story of three different men who have to deal with the criminal problems that are around Basin City. This might not be very well summed up, but it's better to watch it by yourself. The three main stories are interconnected with each other in a very good way, with some characters appearing in other stories, or with the mention of certain places or actions. Although there were some parts I felt like I was missing something in the story, but I could not tell what exactly was missing.<br/><br/>One of the best parts of the movie is the whole cast, and despite being a lot of great actors, they all have time to shine, even if it's a few minutes. From Bruce Willis, Michael Rourke, Clive Owen, Benicio del Toro or Elijah Wood, to Jessica Alba, Carla Gugino, Rosario Dawson, Alexis Bledel or Jaime King. I specially loved the characters of Michael Rourke, Rosario Dawson and Bruce Willis.<br/><br/>The other great thing are the visuals. I think I have never seen something like this before. It is like a direct copy of the comic pictures and the visuals used are amazing, all in black and white except in some cases where you can see the red of the blood or the yellow and golden of the hair. If I have something bad to say about it it's that the music at parts felt like out of place in comparison with the images, for example when Hartigan (Bruce Willis) is entering in the Roark Farm, that part was a bit odd fitting the images, but there were also other parts where it fitted very well. <br/><br/>A very recommendable movie for all the comic book or graphic novel fans and also for all of those who enjoy a lot R rated movies.

","Robert Rodriguez's 'Sin City' brings to life Frank Millear's comic-book world: hard-boiled, stylised, sexy, ultra-violent, but utterly morally uninteresting. The film certainly succeeds aesthetically, and also manages to maintain a consistent tone better, say, than the 'Batman' films, where any attempt to assert a dark side inevitably runs up against the silliness of the concept. But it's also fare to say that when the protagonist changes (there are 3 separate stories here), you hardly even notice, so little is there that separates one part from the next. Ultimately, when everything is sin, that's as good as saying nothing is."

","...is a perfect comic book adaptation though it made almost a shot-to-shot transition from the paper to celluloid. It's noir, it's cool, it's brutal, it's sexy - it's black and white, with dashes of colour.<br/><br/>Sin City brings together three separate story lines, each of them as interesting as the other - and forms a working combination with three different kinds of characters, with three different kinds of an approach to the world of sin. It's a great ensemble of a cast, Hollywood's biggest names filling the screen and pulling it off - Bruce Willis, Benicio del Toro, Michael Madsen, Jessica Alba, Brittany Murphy etc. - though Clive Owen has always been a really big question mark for me when it comes to his acting talent. Elijah Wood and Rutger Hauer in their small roles deserve extra praise. All them aside, the real star of the movie is undoubtedly Mickey Rourke as Marv, the hulking thug. Even from under all that make-up and plastic, Mickey is able to deliver the best and most solid performance in the whole film. He's truly believable as a comic book caricature - which is something marvelous to accomplish.<br/><br/>The movie excels visually - the black and white world with some coloured highlights is a refreshing approach - the play between light and shadow is a beautiful thing to look at and I especially loved the very ""comic-bookish"" - all black character figures against the pail white background - segments. The angles, the sets, the camera-work - it's all good and really separates this as a comic book filmatisation rather than a film based on a comic book. Sin City was filmed against a green screen from start to finish with very little real set props to be truthful visually towards the source material - and it occasionally shows pretty obviously as the CGI and the real life characters don't always blend as good as you'd hope.<br/><br/>Still, Rodriguez and Miller have done something really astonishing with their film and I'm ever so eager to see a sequel. 3/4"

Also, it's one of the few movies where Jessica Alba does a good job. I think she's really good as Nancy, the girl saved by the police officer, which is played by Bruce Willis, who's great. But I would have to say that the best actor out of all of them is Mickey Rourke. He's just fabulous in the movie. I'm surprised he either didn't get nominated or if he did, didn't win the Oscar for this. He should have. He was awesome. <br/><br/>To end, don't see this with your kids.

","""Sin City"", directed by Robert Rodriguez while working closely with Frank Miller and his original graphic novels, is a sort of film noir for the new millennium.

Probably the best performance comes from Mickey Rourke, who plays a hulk of a man framed for a murder that he didn't commit.<br/><br/>The script does a good job of bringing the separate stories together though they mostly run from beginning to end uninterrupted. However, the dialogue, which is typical of film noirs, is sometimes unwieldy.<br/><br/>The film's visual style is quite original and attractive. There is a definite film noir feel but the visuals also hark back to the story's graphic novel roots.

By focusing on different areas, we get a wide spread feel of the city as a hole and what happens underneath the glitz and glamour.<br/><br/>From Rourke's rough and tough Marv to Wood's silent and freakish Kevin do we have an assemble of different protagonists with their own personal agendas. The performances are forgotten in the collection of dramatic issues from the stories such as loyalty, vengeance and sexuality. Though scraping a preaching message, the film is out there to shock and entertain, which it does through high drama and action.<br/><br/>The storyboard styled choreography and visuals works up a stunning treat. From the black and white to the occasional spurts of colour do we feast our eyes on the darkest and most dramatic noir in recent times. Unless you view this for yourself, you will never know the efficiency and scale of the talent on show. There are surely few arguments about this being the most visually stunning in crime noir history. Balancing the colour is a marvellous technique and we see the most iconic moments shining through, in particular Goldie, a true femme fatale.<br/><br/>There are down sides however. Frequent lapses and misjudged dialogue particular evident in Clive Owen's story of Dwight.

In almost every episode the main female characters were active in resolving their conflicts and they certainly didn't perceive themselves as victims.<br/><br/>When you go to see a movie called SIN CITY, which is based upon a comic which typically features women scantly dressed for one reason or another, you should expect to see a fair amount of nudity. Also, this film is in no way suggesting that ALL women are prostitutes or strippers. The town is called SIN City for a reason. If you want to see women portrayed more realistically, you should not see an action/fantasy like Sin City.<br/><br/>By the way, I am a female."

","I'm not a fan of the comic book movie type genres but i loved this movie it was a ten, finally something i can enjoy and watch without getting bored. This movie contained nudity, language and violence, but it did not seem to bother me because stuff like that i can watch but if your not a person that can watch things like these or get confused easily by to many story lines you might not enjoy this movie as much as other comic book fans would or just regular fans. This movie full of suspense, hate, pain, love and salvation all in one. I suggest this movie for people who like suspense and movies that have to figure out because its fun once you know whats going on but if you don't like waiting then you might not like the movie, but if you do not mind waiting for the end of a movie i suggest this. The cast includes B.Willis, N.Stahl, E.Wood, J.ALba and B.Del Toro and many other new and old favorites."

","When I went to Sin City, I had high expectation because I had heard other people talk about how great it was, and I read the justified mark it got here on IMDb. Even when the credits where done scrolling, I could not grasp how incredible amazing this movie is. Well. I could try to describe how absolutely superb the photography was, talk about the brilliant plot, the great acting by an assortment of famous actors and the film-noir sphere it sets, but that are items that belong to movies and Sin City is NOT a movie it's a motion comic. No really, it is Just close your eyes a little so that you see a bit blurry and you really can't tell the difference. It's something you have never seen before. I even think this is going to become a top 10 classic."

","The movie Sin City was entertaining, but had too many missing pieces. True the movie had all the action you would want, but it wasn't even in color... maybe that's brings more excitement, but I want details.<br/><br/>There are three different stories that are told, one story lasts for about 3 minutes, the second 20 minutes, and the third about an hour long. Then the second comes back for a good 40 minutes, and the first at the end for 1 minute. I understand how the director is trying to switch from point to point and connect them at the end, but the connection was horrible. The only connection made was when the 2 detectives were seen together in the bar. Their relation of Nancy was too little to make a good connection in story plot.<br/><br/>During the entire movie, only about a fourth of it consists of actual talking between actors. The narrator speaks for most of the film, which gets annoying after a short while. The detectives thoughts are too much like a novel, and should be more that of a movie.<br/><br/>A good thing about the movie was the action. It never stopped, and the heroes never died! Bruce Willis gets shot about 12 times, does not die until he commits suicide. Mickey Rourke must have been blasted over 60 times, especially with the Uzi guns... he doesn't show pain. This is not reality, too much like an action comic. Every villain except for Jr. gets shot ONCE and dies right then and there, this needs more reality.<br/><br/>6/10. Nothing special, but enjoyable. I didn't like the black and white, it gets extremely annoying after 18 seconds."

","Neither watching the classics of film noir (i.e. The Third Man, Touch of Evil), nor the Tarantino-influencing Shochiku New Wave classics of Seijun Suzuki (i.e. Branded to Kill and Tokyo Drifter), nor even the hardcore pulp of Takashi Miike (i.e. 'Audition' or the disorganized, gory insanity of 'Visitor Q' or 'Dead or Alive') can really prepare you for 'Sin City'. As a fairly desensitized horror/gore/cult movie fan, I still could not immediately take in all of the darkness and stark, stylized violence I was about to see, to say nothing of the seedy subject matter. It's a film of contradictions that vaunts machismo yet displays a beneath-the-surface vulnerability; it is misogynistic yet empowering, dystopic yet hopeful, and crude, raw, and debasing yet beautiful and humanistic.<br/><br/>The surreal violence and gore is the type that one can't easily take one's eyes off of. It's a reflection of the darkest realities of our world (corruption, murder (seems to be 50% of all news), child murder, capital punishment, prostitution, depraved clergy, etc.) brought before a larger-than-life monochrome on-screen microscope.<br/><br/>The performances are appropriate throughout, providing a unique star-studded glorified B-movie feel. Even the occasionally ineffectual (though very hot) Jessica Alba and (sorta hot) Britanny Murphy play their roles well. Mickey Rourke, Clive Owen, Bruce Willis deliver particular commendation for the hard-nosed, hard-boiled portrayal of their respective characters. Elijah Wood, Benicio Del Toro, Nick Stahl, Rutger Hauer, and Josh Hartnett are also mesmerizing wicked in their roles.<br/><br/>The three comic panel-like vignettes allow the viewer to appreciate the many facets of Sin City without becoming too absorbed in any one of the emotionally/morally damaged on-screen persona's. However, this approach amplifies the sense of pervasive evil in the sadistic, might-makes-right, kill-or-be-killed city.<br/><br/>Robert Rodriguez and Frank Miller deliver a technically accomplished cinematographic knockout with minimalistic black-and-white providing a contrast to and accentuating the garish red, white, and yellow (much of it blood). For his trouble, Rodriguez was ousted from the Director's Guild of America for including first-time director Frank Miller in the credits. I hope the accolades he receives for 'Sin City' will serve as a sufficient 'f*ck you' to the DGA, because this is a brilliant collaboration that is unlike anything previously achieved on film."

","There was a texture to the first and third stories that changes slightly for the worst when Tarantino gets his hands on Sin City. Since this is a long movie, I save this section for visiting the concession stand or taking a dump. The third time that I saw it I cleaned up some popcorn that I spilled under the seat. I got a thumbs up from the staff who would have had to clean up the mess I made and I could still hear Rosario Dawson over-acting and imagine all the close-ups that a face like hers doesn't deserve. All I could think of is the line from the movie that runs something like ""power is getting people to say they believe what they know in their hearts isn't true."" Why amateur acting is valued so highly is a matter of politics in this case. Artistically Tarantino is becoming the Sarcoma Kid,a pathetic case. I have seen Sin City three times on the strength of the rest of the movie and intend to see it at least a fourth time. It is hard to deal with a zit on a beautiful face sometimes."

","Not every story can be told well in various mediums. There have been hundreds of books drained of the life poured from their authors' minds when they are transmogrified onto film. Writers are cautious when releasing their works to the wilderness of Hollywood, and Frank Miller felt no differently about his graphic novels. It took serious vision and commitment on the part of Robert Rodriguez to sway Miller's reservations. The story has been repeated in a multitude of magazine and newspaper interviews, and will probably become one of legend. The collaboration between the co-directors results in a jaw-dropping (and frequently jaw-pounding) mix of real actors in a convincingly gritty fantasy world.<br/><br/>The story is a series of 4 (or 5  depending on how you look at them) short stories about the denizens of Basin City. Some stories interconnect, and others just graze each other in non-linear fashion. The Man (Josh Hartnet) opens the film by fulfilling an unusual contract. Bruce Willis' aged cop (Hartigan) puts retirement and his health on the line to save a little girl from a pedophile (Nick Stahl). Like most of the stories, it is simultaneously moving and a grotesque display of machismo. Marv (an unrecognizable Mickey Rourke) is a Quasimodo-like ex-con teetering on the edge of mental illness when he is graced with the affections of Goldie (Jamie King). She is murdered in his bed, and he is left to take the fall. A vicious instinct for revenge seizes him and he demolishes half the thugs and police in the city to satiate his thirst. A waitress (Brittany Murphy) and Dwight (Clive Owen) begin a face-off with an overly-possessive ex-boyfriend (Benicio Del Toro), and Rosario Dawson's ""Gail"" brings her gang of prostitutes in to finish it. The cop, Hartigan, returns to continue protecting the little girl, Nancy, who has now grown up into Jessica Alba.<br/><br/>The entire production creates an incredibly tangible comic book world. Many people are praising ""Sin City"" as the most faithful comic book adaptation to date. It is so faithful, in fact, that frames and scenes from the movie compare directly to the graphic novels. Rodriguez pitches the cast into the black and white world utilizing the extreme breadth of contrast that shooting on high definition video allows between light and dark. Combining the black and white images of actors with backgrounds created almost entire in computers makes such artful renditions possible. Splashes of digitally-added color draw both visual and emotional focus. Everything from production design and camera movements to acting style is over-the top. Villains and those who are relative heroes are all driven by absolute conviction and deliberate force of will. Miller provided the blueprint for this crazed city. Rodriguez and his cast flesh things out in well-mimicked fashion.<br/><br/>It is impossible to comment on everyone in the cast without exceeding the limit of this review. Most outstanding is surprisingly 1980's film star Mickey Rourke. He sinks completely into his portrayal of Marv. Although the prosthetic make-up hides his physical features, he does more than strut a thuggish tough guy persona. Rourke finds the mix of a man who revels in his own excessive brute strength (and when Marv is brutal  hold on to your seat) while also being afraid of crossing some thin moral line within himself. Clive Owen and Benicio Del Toro make great adversaries, and it is delectable that most of it is verbal. (It is rumored that their big scene is the one directed by Quentin Tarantino.) Michael Clark Duncan, Nick Stahl and especially Elijiah Wood all bring fearsome qualities to their villains. Almost equally astonishing to all of those performances is the fact that Rodriguez was able to coax a believable screen presence out of Jessica Alba, who, to date, has gotten by largely on her looks. (If you have ever gotten through an entire episode of ""Dark Angel"", you're a far more dedicated fan than I.) It is crucial for the grown-up Nancy Callahan to be more (if only just slightly) than a dynamite male fantasy figure or else the sacrifices made by Bruce Willis's Hartigan are merely the antics of an overgrown boy with either a crush or denied naïveté. Willis is, interestingly enough, playing an older character. He does so by bringing out more than normal regret and self-loathing with his usual swagger. ""Hartigan"" is richer for it.<br/><br/>A visit to ""Sin City"" is not a vacation for everyone. It is more palpable than ""Pulp Fiction"", and more stylized than any comic book movie before it. Robert Rodriguez undeniably proves his skills as a digital and dramatic visionary. Much like El Greco's paintings are dark portraits of odd characters from the Middle Ages, Miller's ""Sin City"" is a dark vision of unusual characters given life on digital celluloid. This is a work that is about vastly imperfect heroes who each pay a price for making decisions based on their private senses of honor. The kids can skip this adult comic. For the rest who might be brave enough, come on down; the blood in the water is just fine.<br/><br/>9 out of 10"

","Frank Miller and Robert Rodriguez's ""Sin City"" is a stunning visual experience with an inventive narrative style. It is unlike any movie seen before. Along with Guest Director Quentin Tarantino, ""Sin City"" tells it's tale of deceit and vengeance through three interwoven stories. Based on his graphic novels, Frank Miller stylishly narrates the three stories through the voices of three of it's main characters. In a sense ""Sin City"" is completely style driven, which is strangely enrolling. There are strong performances particularly from Mickey Rourke, Bruce Willis, and Jessica Alba. The women in ""Sin City"" are stunningly gorgeous. Jessica Alba is hot as the stripper, Nancy. Carla Gugino as the parole officer, Lucille, who naked throughout is totally hot. She is also good in the role. Rosario Dawson is strong and sexy as the prostitute leader, Gail.<br/><br/>The most captivating story follows Marv (Mickey Rourke), who is this brutish giant with super human strength, and resilience. Marv is tracking down the murderer of hooker, Goldie (Jaime King). Goldie shared the night with monster-like Marv, but was brutally murdered while he was asleep. Marv follows the murder trail along with his parole officer, Lucille (Gugino), which uncovers a gruesome conspiracy at the city's highest levels. This is Rourke's best performance in years. As Marv he is a merciless killer, who he tempers as a noble beast. Rourke's Marv is on the verge of insanity, and has a sense of humor.<br/><br/>Bruce Willis is good as Det. Hartigan, who saves 11 year-old Nancy from Rourke Jr. (Nick Stahl). Rourke Jr. is the son of a Senator. Hartigan saves Nancy, and horribly cripples Rourke Jr. However, in another conspiracy Haritgan is left near death and is prisoned for the ""assault"" on little Nancy. Hartigan takes the fall to protect Nancy. She writes to Hartigan while he is imprisoned which keeps him alive. Through a chain of events Hartigan is released 8 years later, and attempts to locate Nancy. He soon realizes this was a set up. Willis is solid as Harigan. Jessica Alba as the grown Nancy has the right combination of smarts and vulnerability. She is just beautiful.<br/><br/>The least interesting, though still a good story, involves another guy with super powers, Dwight (a darkly charismatic Clive Owen). In yet another conspiracy, Dwight comes to the aid of former flame Gail (Rosario Dawson) and her call girls, who are caught between dirty cops and the mob. Thinking about it, this story makes the least amount of sense, but is it comical for the gore and skimpy wardrobe. So this ends up being a good thing. A stand out is Devon Aoki as the samurai hooker, Miho. She dispatches her enemies with extreme prejudice and grace.<br/><br/>""Sin City"" also makes effective use of Taratino's juxtaposed narrative technique. It is amazing the narration feels seamless throughout. In the end, Frank Miller and Robert Rodriguez prove that all resistance to style is futile. ""Sin City"" is an original experience."

","Before seeing Sin City, I had wondered to myself ""What all the hype about? I mean, sure it's a fairly popular comic book series, but not as popular as let's say Spiderman or X men."" But being a comic book fan I dragged myself in front of the screen and watched it. When the credits rolled on, I'd cocked my head to one side and smiled saying to myself and said: ""Not at all bad."" Very noir. But done in a new style thats not often seen. The whole movie is done in black and white with the exception of small details once in awhile (ei. eyes, blood once in a while, etc.) The black and white effect gave it such a classy look, and if blood and gore isn't your thing it definitely helps ease the pain a little bit. I know that there has been a lot of hype about the cast but has anyone else noticed that they scraped these actors of the floor? I mean, none of them are at the peak of their careers, in fact they're all whinding down. Not that your going be disappointed because it's actually quite interesting how they tie together and make the movie what it is. The only downsides to this movie I would say all depend on your movie going tastes. If you don't like hookers mixed with senseless violence perhaps it's not for you. But like any marvel/DC/comic-book-gone-to-movie it's action packed and a wonder to the eye."

","I don't know what I expected but this movie blew me away. Bruce Willis was excellent and he was the fourth best actor in the film. Other worldly is how I would describe it. What the movies Darkman and Spawn aspired to. It would have been a 10 for me but the Bruce Willis segment was a bit weaker and a bit more predictable. Graphic violence but softened to the senses by the black and white. The prosthetic makeup twists the features of some familiar faces into the cartoon characters they want us to see. Memorable and unique but a lot of splatter. It was a good enough film that I would see the sequel in a heartbeat but so different from everything else out there that it would be a shame not to just leave it as the one of a kind film that it is."

","Very original in style. Yeah there are those ""Tarantino-esque"" comments, but Rodriguez and Tarantino both hit the scene about the same time. Rodriguez is by far one of my most favorite directors, given his story telling style, diversity, and ability to shove it in Hollywoods face when he wants to.<br/><br/>While I don't think any of these rolls deserve an Oscar, they totally pulled me into the world and I believed it was a real place. The diluted colors, stunning black and white, and animated rain and snow. It was a living work of art. Much like the books.<br/><br/>I do think the violence and nudity are above 17 year old viewing. Call me old fashioned, but the ratings are there for a reason. Oddly though, the nudity was the least offensive nudity I've seen since that brief bit in Braveheart."

","Based on the graphic novels by Frank Miller, ""Sin City"" is a collection of interweaving stories all based in the crime infested back alley-ed hole of ""Basin City"". ""Basin City"" looks like New York City or some other major metro city that has gone to hell in a handbag filed with hookers, corruption, and filth.<br/><br/>Hartigan (Bruce Willis) plays a man incarcerated for a crime he didn't commit while befriending a special little girl who he keeps in his mind to always look after when he gets out of jail. Marv (Mickey Roarke) is a hulking giant who seeks the murderer of a beauty who was killed while in bed with him. Dwight (Clive Owen) is an ex-photographer who accidentally kills a hero-cop (Benicio Del-Toro) and has to try and cover it up.<br/><br/>All the stories are connected and it eventually all comes together at the end of the film. It takes a while to get to that point as the film does go on for a long time. The movie is also not for the faint of heart as it is very violent. If you like castrations, be-headings, and numerous loss of limbs with buckets of blood, you'll like it. If that's not your thing, stay away. Keep in mind though, that this film is shot like a comic book and many of the violence is done in comic book style, with animation, CGI, and over exaggeration. The blood is yellow, white, and is used as more of a prop of style than anything else.<br/><br/>""Sin City"" is dazzling to look at. The film, shot entirely in front of a blue screen, is a tribute to film noir, comic books, and I could'nt take my eyes off the screen. All the characters are fascinating people conjured up in Frank Miller's mind. Mickey Roarke's Marv is probably the most creative character to me. I loved how this guy is this giant hulk of man drawn like he came out of a Dick Tracy cartoon with his chiseled face and giant body. He is a despicable person, but for some reason, you like him.<br/><br/>There is a real rogues gallery of B' movie villains all over this movie. Rudger Hauer, Powers Boothe, and Michael Madsen (A Tarentino fave)are all in this. Throw in Mickey Roarke, who is unrecognizable in a slew of band-aids and covered in blood for most of the film, and you've got yourself quite some characters.<br/><br/>""Sin City"" really is quite anchievement. I think, like ""Scarface"", this film will have it's audience and fans for a very long time. It's that type of film. (***1/2)"

","This movie is stunning on a variety of levels. <br/><br/>The visual styling is likely the biggest standout for this film. The roles, the story lines, the dark humor, the skin, and the violence are all remarkable.<br/><br/>The cars are all some form of classic, there is a stab at gumshoe-noir dialogue which unfortunately gets in its own way at times, and using the likes of Rutger Hauer and Mickey Rourke to such good effect all wrap up to make this an amazing violence- and action-laden adventure.<br/><br/>*** POSSIBLE NOT-VERY-SPECIFIC SPOILERS AHEAD ***<br/><br/>If there are knocks for me to give it, they would be the following: As I mentioned, the noir-style self-dialogue narration sometimes worked to set the mood, other times it was too far overdone. <br/><br/>Rosario Dawson, IMHO, could have been a LOT sexier. <br/><br/>Jessica Alba's scene where she is being tortured didn't work that well for me, particularly in regard to that flimsy shirt managing to survive a brutal whipping by TYB. I (almost) understand if she didn't want to make that a topless (or very close to it) scene, in which case that role needed to go to someone else. <br/><br/>Some of the girls of Old Town needed to be seen more! Wow...<br/><br/>-------------<br/><br/>I scored this an 8/10. Thought very hard about a 9/10.

","To begin I feel compelled to say that I have been a die-hard movie fan for over 40 years. There isn't much I haven't seen - much of quality at least. This film is one of the few that drew me in almost entirely on the strength of the trailers. It looked to be innovative if nothing else, and since I am also an alpha-nerd deeply enmeshed in the world of advanced technology I found that allure irresistible. Almost every frame looked CG enhanced in one manner or another. Another draw was the casting. The lineup of talent promised here was another irresistible charm.<br/><br/>As for the story, well, let's just say that the ""R"" rating is appropriate for the violence alone, which is pervasive and often barbaric. The dialog isn't very ""rough"", being more reminiscent of a 1950's Mickey Spillane detective novel than more modern offerings, almost bordering on a sophomoric satirization of something like Spillane. It is forgivable in this example of the genre. Also glaring is the heavy-handed socio-political cynicism of the no-good-deed-goes-unpunished variety in the writing. There is also bound to be some negative views of the film for its uniform portrayal of women as almost nothing other than sex objects, but no one's intellect is overly challenged here so it can be chalked off to the general area of suspension-of-disbelief one must often undertake to approach viewing many films.<br/><br/>So, needless to say, I entered the theater with more than a small bit of expectation. I think I can say I wasn't too disappointed. The film faithfully followed the ""Graphic Novel"" in most details, save for a few transgressions such as the decidedly overdressed characterization of the Nancy Callahan exotic dancer character by the apparently overly-modest Jessica Alba. By contrast, the appearance of Carla Gugino on screen in the part of Lucille was so charged with raw feminine sexual energy it will burnt a hole in the screen and straight through your retinas. She is the real poster girl for this film, at least the one best representative of the material in the original ""novels"".<br/><br/>Some of the other characters were nothing short of outstanding. Notable standouts were Bruce Willis as the hard luck cop Hartigan and his nemesis Senator Roark, played to a turn by Powers Boothe. Clive Owen, who has been working a lot of late, did a powerful job as Dwight against the amazing presence of Rosario Dawson as the dominant Gail. Mickey Rourke, whose career hasn't exactly been on fire of late, gave a powerful portrayal of the obsessed Marv, out to avenge his Goldie, played to stunning perfection by the beautiful Jaime King (who also played the twin sister Wendy). Other standouts were Benicio Del Toro, Michael Clarke Duncan, Alexis Bledel (what photographic genius to highlight those amazingly unreal blue eyes), Michael Madsen, and Brittany Murphy, whom I could have taken more of on screen. Not to be left out, Elijah Wood gave a chilling performance as the very demented Kevin, followed close behind by Rutger Hauer as the twisted Cardinal Roark and the unrecognizable Nick Stahl as the Yellow Bastard. All are to be congratulated on outstanding performances giving life to this gritty if somewhat left-of-sane set of stories.<br/><br/>The rest of the film presentation was wonderfully done with a deep, dark, noir-type atmosphere that I loved. It was another of the draws for me, personally. It's hard to heap much praise on the rest as it's difficult to tell where things like set decoration end and computer generated graphics begin. The blend is seamless, however, and of the best quality. The art direction, costumes and makeup were wonderful as well. The musical score was appropriate but mostly unmemorable, too overshadowed by the powerful visual presentation on screen.<br/><br/>All-in-all this is an excellent film if you can stomach the violence and the negative social commentary."

","Saw this flick Saturday and I was not expecting that much but I was pleasantly surprised. Robert Rodriguez and Frank Miller did an outstanding job of transferring the comic to the screen.<br/><br/>Some have said, what's the point of that? Why go to such painstaking lengths to faithfully recreate the comic? Well, for those of us who either never read the comic or, like me, have just flipped though it, its just amazing to watch the movement and basically see it come to life.<br/><br/>I happened to see it on a new DLP screen and it was gorgeous to watch. I was struck by how violent it was for an R rated movie. I'm talking about severed limbs and private parts being torn off. But I guess comic book violence doesn't count as far as the MPAA is concerned.<br/><br/>The film takes a few different stories from the Sin City books but they all have common threads. Some of the characters are very creepy (Elijah Woods character) Some are humorous (I enjoyed Mickey Rourke's Marv character and story).<br/><br/>Everyone was good but some of the dialog, that probably seemed OK in the graphic novel, came off sounding sort of ridiculous. But this is not a real city so I wasn't that concerned with the 50's detective novel type dialog and the fact that some people are driving Ferarrari's while Cadillacs and cop cars are from the 50's. Or that a female assassin has blood splatter on her face and five seconds later her face has no blood stains.<br/><br/>As for Jessica Alba as Nancy...OOFA! Outstanding in her leather chaps and later looking yummy in a nightie and cowboy boots as she's being whipped by the Yellow Bastard. Her acting was terrible but I didn't care one bit.<br/><br/>By the way, if you have a fetish for women holding and shooting guns, this flick is for you. Tons of it. There is one shot of Rosario Dawson blasting away with a machine gun with a fetishistic smile on her face that is worth the price of admission alone.<br/><br/>Can't wait to get the extended director's cut with all the other scenes they shot included."

This movie really contained nothing interesting to the viewer who looks for complexities in story lines or dialogue. Oh, and speaking of dialogue...if this movie was attempting to combine the simple, unthoughtful dialog of a comic strip with the annoying clichés of 1940's detective movies, it was wildly successful -- if you like recycled style and genre.<br/><br/>What we were left to digest was gratuitous violence which was at times visually displayed in a ""pioneering"" style sure to be copied and even one-upped in the future.<br/><br/>If you like movies that -- even unsuccessfully -- try new things and push the envelope, you'll enjoy ""Sin City"", but in the end it lacks any degree of depth and will be forgotten by this viewer within the week."

"Moonhawk1975","8","0","0","10 April 2005"," Breathtaking visuals enhance a wonderful graphic novel adaptation
","There is something to be said about visual style. It can make a horrible movie entertaining and an excellent one stunning. It can even make a decent movie far better than it is. Without the style of directors Frank Miller and Robert Rodriguez, this movie would have been a forgettable take on film noir.<br/><br/>I'm not a fan of the new film-making method of shooting completely against green-screen and adding everything but the actors and smallest of props later. I think it takes more effort to work with what exists than too create it on a computer. Last year's ""Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow"" was also made this way and, while it was a good movie, it could have worked just as well without the technique. ""Sin City"" could not. The way this movie was filmed is the key to everything. Without style, it would have been forgettable; made without the computer-generated sets and scenery, the movie would have been a disaster. Every last frame of this picture succeeds in ways no other movie has in adapting a comic book. The mood, atmosphere, lighting, coloring (or lack of) and characters all look like they stepped out of the back pages of a newspaper. And I loved it.<br/><br/>The rest of the movie was a little disappointing. The movie is broken up into three or four short stories that interweave some of the same characters and settings, but don't really connect in a traditional film manner. Many will like this, I was under whelmed. Each story has the same basic structure that, given the short time allowed each story, is not able to be fleshed out enough to hide its sketchiness. I also did not like the bleak tone to the movie; numerous characters are not as bad as they act, but nearly everyone meets a violent end. The dialogue is wretched; everyone speaks in the overcooked 1940's film noir tone that has been spoofed and mocked time and again. I was told afterwards by someone who liked this that this was how they spoke in the comics. I don't really care for film noir and I don't like comic books; I am obviously not the intended audience to fully appreciate this movie. Those who are, will love even these few reservations I had and will not be bothered by them. In fact, they will probably embrace them.<br/><br/>High marks also go to the actors, all excellent and each one not given enough screen time. Bruce Willis as Hartigan, a retiring cop who saves a young girl from death, is better here than in any movie he has ever been in before. Sympathetic and heroic, he plays every scene perfectly. Jessica Alba, as the grown up version of said girl, is also wonderful and convincingly sympathetic. I know of her, but have only seen her before in ""Idle Hands"" (a movie not up to her obvious talent). Mickey Rourke is better here than in his movies since the 80's; good marks must go to the heavy makeup he must act through. But, I found his character to be one-note and the least interesting of the ""good"" guys. Pretty much everyone else is barely on screen long enough to make more than the briefest of impacts: Powers Boothe as a sinister senator; Rutger Hauer as a crooked holy man; Rosario Dawson as a tough prostitute; Brittany Murphy as a gritty waitress; Benicio Del Toro as a slimy cop; Elijah Wood as a stealthy cannibal killer who looks like a demented Charlie Brown. But the best by far is Clive Owen. As Dwight, whose back story is either not given or I missed it (all I caught was that he was a murderer who recently underwent plastic surgery), he helps the prostitutes of Old Town keep their independence. He is sympathetic, menacing, tough, vulnerable and, yes, cool. I want this character in a movie of his own.<br/><br/>Comic books fans will love this movie, the casual moviegoer will find it quite good and original. Those who can't tolerate heavy violence and gore (even in black and white) better stay away."

","A film i have been anticipating for over a year, Sin City is a Pulp Fiction- like story featuring three different plots, derived from the graphic novels by Frank Miller, who served as co-director. All the stories take place in Basin City, a town of hookers and criminals and even more criminal police and politicians. I had never even heard of the novels before i had heard of the movie. But after reading about it, it is definitely my kind of comic. And even more so, my kind of movie. The dialouge is smart and hilarious (although occasionally cheesy), the violence is gratuitous but in a good way, and the look of the movie is phenomenal. It is also one of the most exciting movies in years, establishing the characters quickly, and putting them in peril every other minute. You really have no idea of what could happen next. Something that adds to the thrills is that sometimes the characters live and sometimes they die, including the major ones.<br/><br/>Speaking of the characters, the enormous cast of A-list stars bring them convincingly to life. Mickey Rourke (who kicks a metric ton of ass as Marv), Bruce Willis and Clive Owen are excellent, and the film bursts at the scenes with hotties showing their acting chops among other assets (wink-wink) including Jessica Alba, Carla Gugino, Brittany Murphy, Jaime King, Rosario Dawson, and Alexis Bledel. This is the absolute best cast since Goodfellas. While some of them overact (Brittany Murphy) and some underact (Micheal Madsen), it doesn't take much away from the movie, especially since this is one of the best looking movies ever. The stark black and white and frequent splashes of vivid color make for some serious eye-candy, almost equaling that of Gugino's and King's gorgeous birthday suits. Plus, Jessica Alba dances on a pole. I mean come on.<br/><br/>Sin City is the first movie i have seen this year, because basically everything else looks like crap. But it is a refreshing reminder that there are filmmakers like Robert Rodriguez out there who make original and unpredictable movies that come out of nowhere to smack us in the face.

One that included Brittany Murphy's character. she seemed to have overacted compared to the other actors. Josh Hartnett seemed like he was just hanging there. He came, went, and came back without much of story. They didn't explain what or who he was. One might have to watch it a couple of times to ""maybe"" understand his role in the movie. The beginning was a little slow, but picked up the pace within the first ten minutes. there were many high points and that's what made me like and appreciate the movie for what it was trying to be. the action scenes were impressively good. it was funny seeing Elija Wood anything other than the hobbit, but he pulled it off well. the cinematography, lighting, and editing was very good and kept me hooked on each scene. it's usually hard to stay focused on a B&W movie.

Gangsters, cops, killers, bawdy femme fetales, guns blazing, knives plunging slicing and dicing, thugs and just plain weirdos of the criminal kind...now that's a combination sure to make this film a cult classic.<br/><br/>The cast is riddled with talent: Benicio Del Toro, Michael Madsen, Josh Hartnett, Alexis Bledel, Elijah Wood, Rutger Hauer, Rosario Dawson and Michael Clarke Duncan.

Movies are supposed to be artistic and supposed to expertly weave together a story that holds a level of meaning that can be reached by people.

","You know it's funny. I have read a good deal of the Sin City graphic novels, and frankly this movie does not even come close to approximating the visceral and disturbing ideas that are Frank Miller's stock and trade. Robert Rodriguez is an over-rated hack with no courage or conviction. Every film he does is more light weight and disposable than the last one. He is so busy playing with his digital toys that he forgets to come up with a compelling narrative at all. The film is so dull and repetitive that eventually you just give up and start waiting for the next moment of calculated violence to occur. The performances are all over the map, some actors seem to be playing it straight, while others seem to feel they are in a comedy. The digital backgrounds are diffuse and lack detail, which is unforgivable considering the hard-edged look of the graphic novels. A lot of good actors are wasted in walk-on roles that usually require they lose a body part or excrete a bodily fluid. Something this vapid and simple should not have Frank Miller's name anywhere near it. The lack of ideas would not matter if the film worked as an entertainment, but it does not. I was bored throughout most of it and could not believe that Rodriguez had managed to come up with something this stultifying and dull. Robert Rodriguez makes Quentin Tarantino look deep by comparison. What good is film craft if it is used to service a retarded and juvenile vision? There have been many good movies based on graphic novels, The Crow comes to mind, but this film is not one of them."

One of the main characters saying ""I never hit women,"" then he slaps her so hard she's knocked unconscious. The whole movie was repulsive to me.

It's really sorry to see Bruce Willis took this role. He must have been a huge comic fan. The character he's playing is a sorry excuse for a brave cop that amazingly stays alive like so many others in this movie after having been shot and mutilated over and over again. Then there's also the stereotypical view towards women and the catholic church and a couple of Nazi symbols that make no sense but were probably based on the comic as well. If there's a comic i'd like to see a movie of it would be one like XIII or Thorgal or any other good (european) comic with a good background story and solid characters.

"vertigo_14","6","3","8","3 April 2005"," Presumably hyped by avante-garde visuals, not substance. (spoilers)
","I was disappointed upon having seen 'Sin City' the day after it opened in theaters. I am not immediately a fan of films based on comic books or graphic novels, and have not yet seen (or plan to see) any of the recent slew of adaptations. But, this one caught my eye, probably just as it had tempted everyone else because of the director's (and the art director's) tremendous loyalty to the comic feeling (thanks to the film being directed in part by the comic book's creator, Frank Miller, who knew best how he wanted his adaptation displayed). Making some landmark visual innovations that will long outlive the story and probably be copied or spoof more than the aerodynamic slow-motion sequences of the Matrix or Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. This is truly the most amazing element of the film, a comic book come alive in nearly every manner from the noir-ish scenery right down to the most minute details of the performers.<br/><br/>However, looking beyond the surface, and getting past all of the consistent hype of 'Sin City,' I found myself rather bored with the plot. The story, probably better understood by loyal fans of Frank Miller's 'Sin City' comics, is essentially a series of stories of revenge. In each, the grizzly, misunderstood male hero comes to the aid of the damsel (or often, damsels) in distress, inflicting the most grueling punishment upon those who have wronged their lovers in one way or another. To me, it reminds me of a series of 'Kill Bills,' though sometimes, the villain appeared anti-climatic. If you place 'Kill Bill,' and the simplistic story of revenge in a black and white context, a 1950s noir setting, with monotoned, drawn out dialog, you have 'Sin City.' The various stories become repetitive, the same grizzly character (who often defied the laws of physics as did Mickey Rourke's character, Marv, did numerous times--he is shot, slugged in the face, or run over with a car in nearly every scene) to the rescue of nearly the same woman played out like a broken record.<br/><br/>Moreover, the filmmakers appeared to be trying so hard to please, given the thin plot. The cautions of extreme violence were no bologna. Gratuitous violence as it was, the only apparent purpose for it (outside of visual novelty such as white blood that stained up men's suits so bad it looked like bird crap and references to the filmmakers like the removal via firearm of Rourk Jr's ear), was violence for the sake of violence. I have seen my fair share of needlessly violent films and do not complain about the fact that it was violent, but for me, even this element became just as tiresome as the plot because, necessary only to fill the time in the story, which was reduced to a black and white simplicity.<br/><br/>I need not suggest that prospective viewers see this movie for the amazing visual innovation it provides, as this was probably responsible for much of the (overrated) hype that surrounds the film (and would this extend beyond the opening weekend?). I would however, caution, that unless you are heavily interested and can tolerate the predictable stories and rather melodramatic dialog, then you would probably fare much better with this movie than I (or any of the other three people I saw the movie with) would. (I would prefer Kill Bill Vol. 2 over this one). But, then again, there's only one way to find out. Right?"

All the stories are based on the graphic novels ""Sin City"", ""The Big Fat Kill"" and ""That Yellow Bastard"", written and illustrated by Frank Miller.<br/><br/>It's difficult to be more precise about the storyline without divulging the secrets to the plot that you have to pay money to learn. The story is multidimensional which is incredible for a concept that began in only two dimensions. It captures much of the graphic novel's (which is just a really long comic book) look and feel. The characters all seem to be drawn and the colors are basically black and white as if sketched with a pencil. The movie has a strong 1940's film-noir presence. Quentin Tarantino was a guest director. As you watch the movie you can almost guess which scenes he shot as they have his signature. It is similar in the bazaar to Pulp Fiction. Fans and Foes may have a similar response.<br/><br/>The sex was much more understated than I expected but they more than made up for it with the wanton violence. Too much blood and gore.

"sandnair87","9","2","5","6 May 2015"," Sin City is One Guilty Pleasure Trip!
","In 2005, Robert Rodriguez and Frank Miller joined forces in an audacious synthesis - a triptych of film noir adapted from a series of graphic novels – to bring us a world where the villains are ineffably evil, the heroes are compromised, and the city is filled with corruption while mayhem and mischief run amok. The plot, having the direct-action vividness suitable for a video game, is ingeniously constructed in three labeled chapters – 'The Hard Goodbye', 'The Big Fat Kill' and 'That Yellow Bastard'. It takes us into the heart of the dark, grimy Basin City, where crime and depravity are a way of life, through three stories about heroes battling overwhelming odds that circle around each other, amplify each other, and ultimately intersect. <br/><br/>Sin City is a world of shadows, captured in beautiful arctic-white and inkblot-black visuals, where the sun never seems to rise. The makers send their heroes into such labyrinthine hells that it would have been depressing if it weren't so much fun. Frank Miller's potent black humor translates easily to the screen and lifts the often grim subject matter, keeping the film entertaining through the darkest of landscapes. Into this frenzied mix, Robert Rodriguez brings his own chromatic talents. He borrows Miller's panels in lighting and composition, but adds his own sense of timing and bits of color strategically disrupting the pristine black-and-white gloom. But what makes Sin City a gleefully gory gem is that the relentlessly dark story is balanced by visceral joy of pure noir storytelling. And, make no mistake, this is a dark movie. Aside from being black-and-white, it also features nothing but characters scraped off the underbelly of society - ex-cons, hookers, corrupt cops, general low-lives. Rodriguez drenches it in his usual monsoon of ironic, macho macabre, with his camera salivating over curves and cleavage of tough-dame females. But the strength of Mr. Miller's writing has always been his ability to give these bottom-feeders soul thanks to which Sin City exists precisely on the edge between exploitation and artistic statement, ultimately saving itself from toppling over with the sincerity of its tone, the beauty of its images, and the honor of its heroes.<br/><br/>In a film that reaches for the pulpy heights that Sin City does, a lesser cast would be lost, even invisible. But here surprisingly, the cast is neither a distraction nor an aberration. Everyone involved in Sin City not only understands this lurid universe but has a grand time playing in it, especially Mickey Rourke, who captures Marv's subterranean humanity beneath his snarling brutality, using his hungry, manic eyes that peek from behind his freakish disfigurement and Elijah Wood who is the definition of creepy as the mute cannibal Kevin.<br/><br/>Sin City is a gleaming pop revelation – an extremely stylish piece of crime drama that is relentlessly entertaining. For those with a penchant for pulp, Sin City is one guilty pleasure."

","It's hard to think of a film that has such visual inventiveness and strange visual beauty... or one that is so utterly empty. All the techniques of the fetish fantasy film maker (arch-exponent one Q Tarantino) are there: the ultra-violence, the juxtaposition of the extreme with the prosaic (example: a cannibalistic sadist with super martial arts powers called... Kevin... Oh! how I laughed!), a Columbinesque obsession with fire-arms; along with a sackful of other fantasies beloved by teenage boys: big-breasted women, samurai swords, suicide, leather-clad Amazons; happy hookers; seemingly indestructible heroes, more fire-arms, revenge, strangely-shaped knives, stabbing people and getting stabbed (often with strangely-shaped knives)... the list goes on.<br/><br/>Overlaying the orgy of sad comic-book teenage fantasy is a wonderful visual landscape. It is peopled though by cardboard cut-out characters, who woodenly spout clichéd drivel (the chief graduate of the Chippendale school of thespianism on parade is Brit, Clive Owen... maybe he just gave up on the tosh). They perpetually do and say obscene things to each other with a botoxed lack of facial expression. In fact, everything other than the artwork is disgracefully poor in Sin City, which I suppose is indicative of its comic-book origin; indeed, it is a sort of animated ultra-violent comic-book. Even the soundtrack is dull; at least Tarantino produces ultra-violent fantasy films with interesting background music. <br/><br/>Sadly, many teenage boys will drool over this film. Even more worrying is that many grown men I know think it's a brilliant film too... I think about them differently after they tell me this. I strongly suggest any parents with teenage boys encourage them to watch hardcore pornography instead... it will screw them up, but marginally less than watching a film like Sin City."
"Buddy-51","7","2","5","30 April 2006"," generally effective comic book film
","Robert Rodriguez' ""Sin City"" is a highly stylized adaptation of the graphic novels by Frank Miller (who, along with Quentin Tarentino, assisted Rodriguez in the directing). The film draws its look and inspiration from those old film noir movies from the 1940's, the ones set in dark, rain-soaked, crime-infested cities and narrated in florid fashion by a world-weary private investigator or gumshoe. ""Sin City"" has that in spades along with deliberately arch dialogue, self-conscious acting and a visual schemata designed to knock your eyes out.<br/><br/>""Sin City"" tells the episodic tale of three virtually unrelated ""super heroes"" (played by Bruce Willis, Clive Owen and Mickey Rourke) who take on crime and corruption in what is, as the title implies, a veritable metropolitan den of vice and iniquity. The three leads are supplemented by Rosario Dawson, Josh Hartnett, Benicio Del Toro, Elijah Wood and Rutger Hauer in various smaller roles.<br/><br/>""Sin City"" is far more about style than it is about substance, and, indeed, the story is the least engaging aspect of the film, often becoming repetitious and aimless and devoid of cohesion and unity. The look of the film, however, is what keeps us interested. Filmed primarily in black-and-white, the movie adds splotches of color at key moments and for various thematic purposes and relies heavily on rear screen projection to give it just that right post-modern/retro look it needs to be effective. As in the ""Kill Bill"" movies, the violence in the film is graphic but so highly stylized that we never take any of it very seriously, although there may be just a tad too much dismemberment for some people's taste - though, strangely, the people who are killed never seem to stay dead for very long in this movie. The art direction is less sensational than it is in many of these comic book movies, but the streamlined simplicity of the look keeps it from overwhelming the film.<br/><br/>The child molestation theme that runs through the movie may be off-putting to some and it does result in a few queasy moments later on in the film. Still, this is an intriguing and generally entertaining comic book movie that really does a good job recreating the look of the source material on which it is based."
"happy_hangman","Null","2","5","19 January 2006"," Old Miller's Misoginy
","I had low expectations of this movie  chiefly because my expectations of author and co-director Frank Miller have diminished radically in recent years. Twenty years ago Mr M. was one of the most innovative and challenging writers in the comic-book medium: his 'The Dark Knight Returns' is both an effective satire of the medium and an effective dystopian adventure story. Like the true masters of the genre, Eisner, Kirby and Moore, he recognised that, while graphic storytelling has much in common with prose narrative and still more with cinema, it was an entirely different medium that required a distinctive 'grammar'. While Miller was never a visionary in the same league as Eisner or Moore, and lacked the populist touch of Jack 'King' Kirby, he was one of the key writers in developing literate, intelligent comic-narrative.<br/><br/>Then, in the mid 1980s he started believing his own publicity. He refused to be edited, artists found him astonishingly difficult to work with, and most of his work  by the mid-1990s  was self illustrated or self published. What followed was a series of violent, misogynistic, neo-noir tales  stylish, visually distinctive, but ultimately with nothing to say. Initially these works were hailed as ironic, but, through repetition and an over reliance on cliché, it soon became clear that there was precious little irony intended.<br/><br/>Welcome to 'Sin City'.<br/><br/>On film as on the page, 'Sin City' is an oh-so-stylish mess. It looks great. Rodriguez, as cinematographer, and Art Director Jeanette Scott have captured much of what made Miller's artwork so interesting, but so much bloody time is spent trying to recreate these images that, particularly in the first third of the film, the pace is leaden. As this film is aimed at a mass-market such panel-by-panel reproductions are pointless  and, remember, I'm saying this as a confirmed and unrepentant comic-geek. That said, the use of stark whites and jet blacks is used very well in the final story. A little more consistency in certain visual areas  blood, for example, is variously white, black or red  would have been appreciated.<br/><br/>All the men are hard-as-nails, borderline psychotic and have hearts of gold. All the women are whores, betrayers, victims  or a combination of all three. No woman in 'Sin City' is perceived as anything other than a sex-object, of one sort or another. Rosario Dawson, Devon Aoki, Brittany Murphy et al are, therefore, unfeasibly attractive streetwalkers, yet  despite the acres of collective flesh they display during the course of the movie  Jessica Alba, the only one amongst them to have a 'no-nudity' clause in her contract, manages to be far sexier than the lot of them. I'm forced to admit, though, that, for all my criticisms of Miller's sexism, I'd probably have gone to see this film just for the sight of Alba in her cowgirl outfit.<br/><br/>As for the men? Powers Boothe, Michael Madsen and Michael Clark Duncan are criminally under-used. Benetio Del Toro is bloody awful. Clive Owen's attempt at an American accent is distracting. Mickey Rourke and Bruce Willis, as Marv and Hartigen  the two most interesting characters in the 'Sin City' graphic-novels, fare a little better. Willis has learned late in his career, it seems, that his more restrained performances are his best: in his less animated moments he's at his most expressive.<br/><br/>Ultimately this is a big stylish mess of a movie.<br/><br/>But Jessica Alba does look very nice in her cowboy outfit."

I saw this movie whenever it hit the theaters. I finally got the courage to show this movie to show my father, who evidently believes that this movie is a cartoon-sh style flick that Robert Roddiguez and Quentin Tarintino try to make the audience appeal to whenever they try to create a new movie. But I do not believe that it is true and that is has an affect on this film! I finally dragged him to see this film and few day ago at the dollar cinema because he did not believe in the cinema affects that I had the privilege to appreciate on the big screen! Whenever he judged the movie I knew he was wrong to confuse a hard-earned movie to its fullest potential! Whenever I viewed the movie to him, he was to fulfill the plot holes to himself. You see, he believed the movie to be fake and not appeal to the audience abroad. He believed that the movie was fake because the cinematography was fake and that the script did not appeal to him as an individual who took graphic novels appealing to a person who who can judge an individual, as frank miller, as an director with his perception on his graphic novels, would be portrayed on the big screen. I am glad that I showed my father of the film that Robert Rodiguez portrayed on the big screen. I can only hope that other people can find an change of heart to their family members in this film, because this film does not appeal to the women of my family and I do not think it will ever find a change of heart towards them. I am glad I changed the fate of my fathers only to appeal oneself on the effectiveness that the movie had an affect on my fathers self appeal!!

To me this film deserves to be nominated for a coupla academy awards. The action as well as the violence and gore are just what make this movie more influential than ever. Personally my favourite character in the movie would be Marv, played by Michael Rourke, indeed the best suited for the movie and someone I can relate to. Unlike other adaptations, this movie seems to be very carefully done so as to keep it as fair as possible to the book and include everything.

","STAR RATING: ***** Unmissable **** Very Good *** Okay ** You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead * Avoid At All Costs <br/><br/>Sin City is a dirty little place where a group of disheartened characters go about their downbeat little business. We open with Hartigan (Bruce Willis) a cop nearing 60 with angina problems who nevertheless remains hell-bent on bringing in the abductor, molester and potential killer of a little girl who happens to be the son of a prominent senator. This, however, leads him down a depressing personal path destined to end in disharmony. We then move in on Marv (Mickey Rourke) a go-it-alone tough guy whose downfall will be his need to bring the killers of a hooker he loved to justice. Then there's Dwight (Clive Owen) who wants to protect his new love Shellie (Brittany Murphy) from her ex-lover Jackie Boy (Benicio Del Toro) and his gang and in doing so shatters a truce between the hookers of Sin City, the local cops and the mob. To round off this series of interwoven tales, we go back to Hartigan who has to go on trying to protect the little girl he saved in her childhood in her adult years.<br/><br/>Filmed in distinctive film noir style, in terms of presentation at least, Sin City is the first must-see movie of the year. It's also a comic book movie of an entirely different kind. While similar ideas were expressed in the 2003 adaptation of Hulk, this comic-book-on-the-big-screen movie is aimed squairely at the adult market (certainly won't be appearing in no Saturday morning matinée!) with the emphasis on ultra-violence and as much flesh bearing sexual insinuation as you can imagine. In fact, it's one of those movies where at times it seems like the violence is so graphic it's almost parodying the notion of screen violence just as a knowing wink to the audience that it knows what they're all thinking.<br/><br/>On the performances front, Willis can play the hard-boiled, edgy cop persona practically in his sleep (though his wise-cracking edge is conspicuously absent here!) with ten years added on his character here, Rourke too does his standard specialty to perfection as the brooding tough-guy and Owen obviously took my King Arthur comment to heart and became a better performer. The best part of it is his fabulous American accent. It's basically just the main cast doing what they've always done, but knowing what they've always done and doing it well.<br/><br/>Overall, this is one that those without the blessings of strong stomachs might have trouble enjoying or those with a value that women have come on as more than just sex objects, but it's an impressively told collection of tales with a great cast and a presentation and style that really makes it stand out. ****"

","*SPOILER ALERT* *SPOILER ALERT*<br/><br/>""Sin City"" must be the most faithful comic book adaptation ever made. I have been a Frank Miller fan for a long time and have read all of the Sin City comic books. ""Sin City"" not only takes its plot from the comic books, it also uses the exact same dialogue and even films the exact same artwork panels. ""Sin City"" is the comic book come to life on the big screen.<br/><br/>""Sin City"" is filmed in black and white with occasional splashes of color. Three tales of sin, crime and corruption play out as large helpings of violence drench the screen. Mickey Rourke is perfect as big, bad loser Marv. He tears through Sin City looking for the killer of his beloved Goldie. His tale is the harshest with the help of sick puppy Kevin and various other miscreants. The Rosario Dawson tale is the most ""comic book"" with hookers in crazy outfits turning into vengeful assassins when trouble runs into their part of town. Bruce Willis shows up as a cop with a bad heart who wants to save hot stripper Alba from that Yellow Bastard. All three stories are excellent with Rourke's being the best. Sex, violence and lots of white, red and yellow blood fill the screen.<br/><br/>""Sin City"" is excellent. You have to see it. Its love for the comic book and for pulp violence in general is evident in every second of the movie. Seek it out. You won't be disappointed."
"The_Void","8","2","5","3 June 2005"," An absolutely amazing experience
","The first thing you will notice about Robert Rodriguez's violent comic book crime masterpiece is the outstanding visual style. While many comic book movies are happy to simply take the story from their source material and turn it into a film, Rodriguez has gone further and took both the story and the comic book's own style, and the result is a movie that really feels like a comic book brought to life. The way the action quickly jumps from one scene to another, the over the top dialogue and, most importantly, Frank Miller's use of colour, are all there; and all in all, Sin City has raised the bar for comic book movies. Sin City is very positive for cinema on the whole, as it proves that there's still some originality left, and it also shows that if used properly, computer generated environments definitely can compliment a film and, in this case, even make it what it is. I had designs on what I thought the movie would be like before viewing it, but even so; after the first scene, which is completely in black and white except for the red on the dame's lipstick and dress, completely took me by surprise and throughout the movie you cant help but marvel at the unique visual treat that is being put before you.<br/><br/>Robert Rodriguez is a man that often loses out in the credibility department to his more popular friend (and special guest director on this production) Quentin Tarantino, and this is unfair in my opinion. Let's not forget that Rodriguez is the man that made El Mariachi for a mere $7000, and made it GOOD. The rest of the Desperado trilogy showed that Rodriguez has a real flair for comic book style action, and all in all I don't think there could have been a better man for the director's chair on Sin City. Rodriguez has applied his trademark of rounding up a host of popular stars to this film as well, and simply put; this film could not have been better cast. Mickey Rourke is the standout as the brute Marv, and he gives an amazing performance in that role. The way he commands the screen is great and his ugliness compliments the role excellently. Bruce Willis and Clive Owen are the other two lead men, and while Willis doesn't quite look old enough to be playing a 68-year-old copper; both of them do well in their roles also. Jessica Alba is scintillating as the very sexy Nancy Callahan, and the guys will be pleased to know that Sin City features a plethora of scantily clad women! <br/><br/>The film is split up into three stories, each based on a different Frank Miller book. Mickey Rourke's section of the film is the best, with lots of torture sequences and a beautiful dame at it's centre. Clive Owen's story is a treat for the eyes, as we enter 'old town'; a part of Sin City run by a load of prostitutes. And finally, Bruce Willis' story sees him on the trail of a child molester who he 'disarmed' years earlier. This tale is the creepiest of the bunch, and that story's central character, 'The Yellow Bastard', is a masterpiece of scum and villainy. The entire movie plays out like a film noir from the height of the era; only the comic book style gives it an extra ounce of muscle, and describing this film as 'film noir on steroids' wouldn't be a misplaced description. The melodramatic acting and dialogue help the film to capture the 50's style, and it's a treat for a fan of those sorts of films, such as myself, to see a modern day take on it. Overall, Sin City is one of the best films to come out this millennium. It's visual style is superb and this, when mixed with some invigorating stories and a fantastic cast, make Sin City a winner all the way."

Rodrigues is a true genius, he was able to satisfy both producer's needs for a big gross and to manage to make the movie as stylish as possible. Since the movie is based on a comic book, the plot is unbelievable as best, however, it gives actors huge space for character development. And so they're doing their best. All performances are equally flawless, and it was especially nice to see Mickey Rourke in his old character. Special effects are also used very reasonably, creating fictional, but totally believable world. So, to sum up, the movie itself is flawless, acting, directing, and FX are great, so it's a masterpiece!"
"film-critic","10","2","5","15 April 2005"," Worth going to hell for. Amen.
","I will say this once, and preach it until the day that I die, but if Criterion does not pick up this title, I may  just maybe  loose faith in their choice of films. This was, hands down, one of the most stylish and innovative films to come out of Hollywood to date. The graphic mind of Frank Miller with the candy-violence ways of Rodriguez coupled together created an undeniable force of creativity and passion that continually lack in the over-budgeted Hollywood films. I have read several reviews that boast the cinematography of this film as being way before its time (thus the apparent lack of support at the box office), but while I did think the way that Rodriguez filmed this movie was outstanding, I thought that it was more than just a visual treat. Everyone in this film seemed to be giving more than what I bargained for. From the direction, to the actors, to even the darkened themes that resonated loudly throughout the film, Sin City was perfection to they eye, but also in every other critiquing category.<br/><br/>What captivated me more than the visual eye-candy was the overall story of Sin City. Rodriguez and Miller both chose to keep the original narrative from the graphic novels to help tell the story that they had filmed. Not only did it help us get from point ""A"" to point ""B"" of the story, but it also helped us learn about the characters without the indecent flashback or long speeches. I learned more about the inside of Marv's mind through the battles that he was having with himself than with any other technique that could have been used. I think that brings me to another reason this film worked on more levels than anticipated, because I knew the characters. This is a character driven story. While they to commit graphic scenes of violence, it is the characters that literally steal the show. I can only think of a handful of films (mostly Wes Anderson movies) where I felt like the characters were the central focus, not explosions or sex. While these things surrounded our characters, it was the characters (the strength of the actors) that kept my eyes on the screen.<br/><br/>Continuing with the story, one cannot help but be impressed with the consistency in Miller's stories. The overall themes of each of the stories, while told in different voices and situations were all the same. The theme of love, lust, and revenge seemed to follow all of our characters around the city and surprisingly, it worked. I was never more impressed to see the same themes reworked over and over. Love is huge in this film. Each character has a passion, or a love for someone else, which drives them to the brink of madness. With each character's love followed a moment of revenge. If you look at all three stories, the main narrators are fighting for someone that they love to bring justice to those that did this one person wrong. ""Revenge is a dish best served cold,"" they say, but in the case of Miller's pen, he serves it hot and heavy. Finally, there is a moment of truth with each of the stories. I didn't realize this until I had spent several days thinking about this film, but in each of Miller's stories we are not shown the full truth. It is a one sided story where we see the action through the eyes of the main narrator. We are only shown one truth, instead of jumping back and forth between good and evil. I really liked this because it created a sense of distrust in Sin City. Were the guys that we were cheering for really the ""good"" in the equation, or were they just all elements that created the chaos known as Sin City? Marv's story in particular exemplifies this idea. His blurred vision of reality resonated through me as the film continued to the other stories, and made me question several of the ""endings"". Think about this when you see it again (and possibly again and again) because remember, the title of this film is Sin City, those that reside in it are not always the ""good"" in the ""good vs. evil"" equation.<br/><br/>Finally (and I know I have mentioned it already above, but I want to honestly put it aside from everything else), I would like to recognize the caliber of acting that came from our actors. Here we have the best in the industry proving that they can handle the pressures of a huge budget, yet also place 100% of their heart into a smaller scale. Their ability to create this noir-styled picture and stay with the style created back in the 40s was impressive. The 40s released some of my favorite films, and these actors paid a huge homage to them. Some will argue that the dialogue is choppy and humorously bad at times, but I say that you need to explore some of the 40s crime noir films and see that they are just building on an already beautiful structure. Everyone involved in this film was outstanding. I cannot think of one character that I disliked or thought could have done better. I think it is the fact that I have to give credit to Rodriguez for revitalizing the careers (and showing the world what amazing older talent we have) of Rutger Hauer, Mickey Rourke, Bruce Willis, Powers Boothe, and Michael Madsen. These guys proved that they are some of the heaviest hitters in Hollywood. Also, Sin City proved that Clive Owen will be in Hollywood for a very long time and will soon have every award imaginable. He is my new Hollywood God.<br/><br/>Overall, and if you couldn't tell already, I thought this was a perfect film. Criterion, this film is all yours.<br/><br/>Grade: ***** out of *****"

","I find it very hard to describe this movie in a manner that words will do justice. Similar to comic book medium, most of the story is based upon visual format. With that being said, this movie is an absolute orgy for the eyes. <br/><br/>Without repeating what most others have previously indicated so eloquently, I'll just add that about 5 minutes into the first scene, I felt like I was in an F-15 Eagle; full after burner ascents, cork screws and under black-out condition g-forces for the next 2 hours SOLID. The ONLY negative was just that. You never get to come up for air, and I felt mentally exhausted (while still exhilarated) after the credits began to role.<br/><br/>Two things about this amazing tour de force that really stood out with me: 1). This was the role Rourke was born to play. If he isn't nominated for an Oscar, then something is terribly twisted in Tinsel Town. Again, I can't even begin to describe his portrayal of Marv, other than to say once we recognized him as this character, the screen was simply alive with blistering energy. Then factor in other exceptional performances put in by Del Toro, Alba, Owen, etc., and he still rises head and shoulders above the others. It's going to be remembered as one of the finest anti-hero performances ever. 2). Not too many movies completely pervade my thoughts long into the night. My wife and I had plans afterwards, but all we could do was talk about what we just experienced. NO MOVIE had ever completely occupied my thoughts the following day. I still find myself wickedly drawn to the impressions I'm left with.<br/><br/>10 out of 10  my highest praise possible."

Fortunately, it is a hit at the box office.<br/><br/>Robert Rodriguez, the mastermind behind the El Mariachi trilogy (El Mariachi, Desperado, and Once Upon a Time in Mexico) was the main guru who created this film by mixing his amazing ability to edit scenes and shots together along with his talent as a comic book illustrator. He also Co-composed the soundtrack.<br/><br/>Frank Miller, the creator of the Sin City graphic novels was also a director, who, since he created Sin City, made sure all of the details stuck with the overall story and message of the film.<br/><br/>Finally, Quentin Tarantino was a guest director of the film, whose specialty is making characters look like bad asses, and he did an outstanding job with that too.<br/><br/>Overall the film was the best film that has come out this year, better than Million Dollar Baby, and is a must watch for anyone who is into movies."

","If you liked Kill Bill, then you'll like Sin City at least as much.<br/><br/>My opinion? It doesn't matter how much you dress up shyte, it still smells the same.<br/><br/>There were only four other people in the theater this evening when I saw Sin City, but that's the point of going to a Monday matinée. Two of the four walked out halfway through the movie. I sat there, completely bored -- if you can believe it, with all of the action and gore on the screen -- and tried to get my money's worth.<br/><br/>I don't quite think Sin City was horrible, but it was just yet another orgy of style over substance. The artwork and visual style are truly stunning, and a faithful translation from the graphic novels to the big screen. The dialog, however, was awkward in quite a few places and most of the acting went beyond the expected deadpan to completely flat. Several of the actors seemed bored rather than terrified even as their characters were being dismembered. Clive Owen seemed unsure whether to play a stand-up hero or a slightly insane ex-con. Fans would say he was going for both, as those were both aspects of the character. But the impression that I got was that he wanted to play one or the other, and couldn't quite make up his mind.<br/><br/>In fact, the only actors I thought actually gave good performances were Mickey Roarke as Marv (except during his first scene with Carla Gugino's character, where he gets into some of that awkward dialog I mentioned earlier), and -- believe it or not -- Jessica Alba. I normally don't think Alba can act her way out of a wet paper sack, but she actually sold me on Nancy, especially during her heart-to-heart with Bruce Willis' Hartigan.<br/><br/>There was no character development, and no more plot development than that necessary to get the hero to storm off on a killing spree chasing down the badguy. If this movie hadn't been filmed the way it was, it would be largely ignored except by die-hard fanboys of the comics.<br/><br/>If you like some character development, sympathetic and empathetic characters, a tight and intricate plot, and witty dialog, you're looking at the wrong movie. But if you're looking for the stylistic successor to the Kill Bill movies, enjoy...<br/><br/>I give it 9 stars for style, but only 1 for substance, for an overall 5 stars."

"Bigbang","6","2","5","3 April 2005"," could have been great, RUINED with ridiculous violence.
","I'm at the point where brutal and repulsive violence for the sake of entertainment doesn't work for me. Sin City is the most original looking movie I've ever seen, and I enjoyed the faithful translation of Frank Miller's stark and beautiful artwork. The old-time film noirish dialog was well done and a pleasure to listen to. Mostly the actors did a great job in their roles, especially Mickey Rourke, and I enjoyed his story the most compared to the other 2 or 3 in the movie. It's disappointing that Sin City could have been a spectacular film achievement but was ruined for me because of the ridiculous violence. I'm not usually squeamish or a pansy , and I realize that the violence is in the graphic novels, but seeing it on the big screen is different. I think it's a cop out. It's easy to emotionally affect the audience with increasingly inventive human physical suffering, but making something entertaining through dialog, character and story is hard. Violence as entertainment is lazy. I realize that it's over the top and cartoonish, and that it obviously doesn't bother many others as we can see from the reviews here. Still, why is chopping someones arms and legs off and then letting a dog eat at the wounds entertaining? How is slicing the front of someones neck so they become a human pez dispenser entertaining? While they're still alive and talking? Yes it's funny but it's also repulsive and stupid. How is ripping someones grotesque yellow genitals off interesting to watch? Do you feel good after you leave the theater? Well, it ain't for me, which is the reason I haven't seen any of the Kill Bill's yet, and probably never will. I'm tired of the moronic brain-dead violence, call me when you develop some real talent and don't need to resort to that to entertain an audience. I only gave it a 6 out of 10.<br/><br/>Otherwise, Sin City is definitely worth seeing. It's a stunning work of film-making art."

","Sin City<br/><br/>Rating: **** (Four stars out of five)<br/><br/>Based on a graphic novel, the labor of love that is the new film Sin City exemplifies a case of style ruling over substance. But what a style it is!<br/><br/>This style is brought to life by director's Robert Rodriguez (the guy behind the Sky Kids trilogy believe it or not), Frank Miller (the creator of the graphic novel) and special guest director Quentin Tarantino who all present an ugly world that is beautifully framed. The film is meant to be a modern type of film noir, a sub-genre of film that gained massive popularity in the golden age of Hollywood (think Humphrey Bogart in 1941's The Maltese Falcon). <br/><br/>To bring this old style to a new audience, the visuals are perfected on the computer thanks to state-of-the-art technologies. The original graphic novel contained only black, white, and a few other solid base colors. The film helps recreate this look cinematic ally by cranking up the contrast and using bright colors that distinguish themselves clearly from the otherwise dark landscapes. It is a world that aches of the past.<br/><br/>Make no mistake, this is a film that has been crafted and not manufactured. Every detail is lovingly placed. It is also a film that aims to sucker punch its audience in the head with violence, twists and overall absurd antics. That's not to say violence is all Sin City has to offer, though. There is romance, action, drama and even black comedy (perhaps the entire affair could be looked at as a black comedy.) The experience Sin City offers is much more alive than last fall's listless Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow, another film that achieved majestic visuals through CGI.<br/><br/>A gigantic cast helps Sin City move beyond the status of a few fanboys wet dream. With this cast three major story lines taken from the graphic novel are fleshed out, all of them evoking the sensibilities of true film noir. One involves Mickey Rourke's character Marv and his revenge scheme while another plot line follows Clive Owen's Dwight through his bloody exploits. The final story deals with framed cop John Hartigan, played by Bruce Willis. The three stories work together well as characters intersect and situations become more and more twisted.<br/><br/>Still, Sin City is not without its flaws and at the end of the day the visuals have much more depth than anything the script has to say. With the radiance of the visuals, though, that's not necessarily a major complaint. Yet, the mostly one-dimensional characters do take away from the lasting impact of the film. The film has got more to it than many effects-laden blockbusters, but that's not saying much.<br/><br/>Overall, film noir is a genre capable of great expression, able to tap into the inner workings of the human condition. What Sin City does is takes the most interesting aspects of this style and throws them all into a big mix. The result is a stunning experience that is filled to the brim with entertainment but also lacking in some of the subtler details that give noir its ability to strike into the darkest, deepest sections of the human soul.<br/><br/>Critic's Conclusion: It's a bloody, violent affair full of cruel characters and broken spirits, but yet Sin City is beautiful in its bold yet simple vision. It is a film created to entertain the darker side of the human spirit, memorably appealing to the senses more than the intellect."
"fred-287","Null","2","5","2 April 2005"," I can see why they're called ""graphic"" novels..... (possible spoilers)
","With so many movies nowadays being based on comic books---excuse me, ""graphic novels"" now---I almost feel like an interloper in the audience. So I try to ignore the movie's origins and just take it on it's own merits. I went to see ""Hellboy"" because I like Guillermo Del Toro's stuff (and was not unhappy with it) and I went to see ""Sin City"" because I like Robert Rodriguez' stuff. I once read a few pages of a ""Sin City"" story (it had a woman handcuffed to a bed, fans presumably will know which one it was) and found it visually very striking (this was in a bookstore and I would have felt guilty reading more without buying it). Clearly Rodriguez wanted that exact look for his film, everything stylized. Warren Beatty tried that once with ""Dick Tracy,"" with mixed results. I would call these results also (decidedly) mixed.<br/><br/>Like ""Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow,"" also shot in front of screens, the visual aura alone is enough to keep one's attention riveted, whether or not the action being viewed makes a lot of sense. Inevitably (and probably intentionally) the characters are somewhat two-dimensional, especially when the make-up makes them look like cartoons, the most extreme example in ""Sin City"" being of course the ""Yellow Bastard"" who reminded me of a character in one of the ""Star Trek"" spin-offs on TV. This keeps the viewer at a certain distance from the proceedings, making it harder to become emotionally involved with the characters but easier to cope with the violence that occurs, and trust me, there's a lot of it here, and it's really nasty. But unlike some comic-based flicks set in real places with ""ordinary"" people involved, the ""Basin City"" in this movie has no specified region or time period and no one seems to live there except cops, crooks and prostitutes. In a way it reminded me of ""Last Man Standing"" (also with Bruce Willis) where the ""town"" had no population except two rival gangs and a passive sheriff. All these people seem to exist for no reason except to kill and/or be killed, as nastily as possible. There's a corrupt Senator lording it over everyone rather like a medieval feudal lord. But in the Middle Ages the peasants really had no options. In Sin City the characters have automobiles (1950's vintage, including a gorgeous Chevy Bel Air) but it never seems to occur to anyone to get into one of these and drive it to another town where maybe life is slightly less horrible.<br/><br/>In ""Kill Bill,"" directed by Rodriguez' ""brother"" Quentin Tarantino, there was also a lot of stylized violence but with an emotional resonance because one could get caught up in what was happening with Uma Thurman as our ""alter ego."" ""Sin City"" has several chronologically overlapping stories a la Tarantino's ""Pulp Fiction"" but without the latter's mordant charm or quirky humor. It's a more or less non-stop exploration of ever more inventive ways to kill and/or torture and/or abuse people. After a while I was thinking ""Shouldn't someone just nuke this effing place and put all these people out of their misery?"" It would've made more sense if it had turned out to be set on some foreign planet, like ""Dark City"" or John Norman's ""Gor"" novels. Here's what I think the problem boils down to: in a movie with even the most fantastical of premises, there has to be a kind of ""inroad"" of perception for the audience (at least for some of us). As Monty Python's John Cleese once put it, ""Once you choose your 'crazy' premise, you must stick to it absolutely rigidly."" There has to be some kind of hook upon which we can hang our figurative viewing hats. For some, of course, the ""violence buzz"" is plenty. ""Hey, there's a guy with his arms and legs chopped off, and he's getting eaten by a wolf!!! Can they top that?...."" ""Hey, there's a mutant freak whipping a woman whom he'd also raped when she was a child, and now he's getting pounded into an amorphous mass!!! Can they top that?..."" etc.<br/><br/>(Just for the record, when the young girl was sitting tied to a chair getting menaced by the creep, that pretty much soured the rest of it for me. Stuff like that happens in real life and if I have to see it in the movies, I want to see it in a real-life context. Maybe I'm just showing my age.) The actors all seemed to be giving Rodriguez (and credited co-director Frank Miller) what he wanted. Powers Booth as the evil Senator made the best impression on me; with this and his equally visceral work as whorehouse boss Cy Tolliver on HBO's ""Deadwood,"" he seems to have come full circle to when he blew me away as the Rev. Jim Jones many moons ago. Mickey Rourke, always underrated as an actor I thought, was amazingly effective under his facial prosthetics. The chicks were all pretty cute---I put it that way deliberately, since that seemed to be why they were there.<br/><br/>One final bit of grumpiness: what was the point of inserting a set of IRA types as villains? By reminding us of the existence of these real killers of real people (including the recent knifing of a Catholic guy in a bar) the movie just highlighted the rest of it's own ""alien-ness."" Why not throw in Al Qaeda while they were at it? Gotta admit, though, ""Sin City"" looks darn good. Can't recall when I've seen such sadistic nihilism presented with so much flair and panache. Heck, Mr. Rodriguez could give Japan's Mr. Miike a run for his money. It's all just a comic book anyway, so enjoy!"

I could think of some, but compared to the overwhelming awesomeness of everything else, why bother?<br/><br/>You cant help but root for the uncomplicated heroes; the unstoppable beast of a man Marv, the virtuous selflessness of Hartigan (and Marv again!).

","This movie is awesome! It's a great action flick and I loved the writing. I'd never heard of Frank Miller before (*hangs head* sorry) and I loved these stories. The actors are all excellent and play their parts perfectly. Elijah Wood is amazing and very surprising, and certainly made me forget he was Frodo - fantastic young actor who I know we'll see much more of in the future. I wish Nick Stahl could get a role as a ""good"" guy though some time in the future. After this movie and Bully I don't know how likable he is :-) The visuals are one of my favorite aspects of this film. There's the typical kinds of eye candy but there's also so much more besides the women and violence. The use of color was something I don't think I've ever seen before except maybe in foreign films. The humor was the most unexpected part of the film but superbly done and definitely kept the movie rolling along at a nice pace. I don't want to give too much away but this is a definite must-see and must buy, for sure. I only wish I would've taken someone to see it with me instead of going alone because I could be discussing it with them right now instead of making comments here. :-) Oh, and I'm a 26 year old straight female in case that helps y'all better gage my comments. And for those people offended by the violence - hello! Did you watch the previews? It's an imaginary world and way too many people are taking it personally ... just sit back and relax - it's a movie!"
"boinkoz","Null","2","5","1 April 2005"," Looks Great, too bad they forgot to tell a story
","Awesome technical work. A fun ride, but who wants to be on a thrill ride for over two hours. Fun to see well know actors in a live animation style. Fun trying to guess who certain people are when you first see them. I'd say one actor who should have been in the film is Christopher Walken. It was really fun seeing Mickey Rourke work in such a substantial part. Great visual design. Tedious stories or lack of a story that matters is a major problem. I guess when the only resolution in your narrative toy box is violence, then every narrative looks like murder and mayhem, although the attempt at a couple of ""redemption"" plot s is a good try. I wish Tarentino had spent as much time watching Ida Lipeno noir classics as he did watching Asian martial arts flicks. Hope it makes lots of money so someone with a good story will get to try the digital green screen stuff. Since it was shot in Texas and some name actors only had to work a day or so, I imagine it will turn a big profit in theaters and other releases. On the other hand: Felt way too much like a Pulp Fiction or Kill Bill wanna be.<br/><br/>B"
"seaview1","Null","2","5","31 March 2005"," Sin City is a triumph for hardcore fans
","Frank Miller, the lord of graphic comic novels, has been given his just due in a sumptuously stylized film version of his Sin City. Lovingly brought to the screen by Robert Rodriguez with an assist by buddy Quentin Tarantino, this tale of vengeance and lust in a dark metropolis is unlike any movie in recent years in terms of consistent technique and visuals serving a group of interconnected stories in which the outcasts of civilization engage in urban survival while attempting to maintain a sense of honor and love. It is also an extremely violent film.<br/><br/>On a dark, rainy night, three major stories parallel each other. The first story has Detective John Hartigan (Bruce Willis) search for a missing girl before a serial killer strikes again. With his unsavory partner, Bob (Michael Madsen), he finally tracks down the killer in a bang-up finish, or is it? A separate story has a brutish exconvict, Marv (Mickey Rourke), who seeks revenge for the murder of a hooker. He is befriended by a parole officer, Lucille (Carla Gugino), a waitress, Shellie (Britanny Murphy), a stripper, Nancy (Jessica Alba), and a hooker, Gail (Rosario Dawson). His search for the killer pulls him into a grisly world of murder led by psychopaths, dirty cops, and corrupt, political leaders. Another story has a loner, Dwight (Clive Owen), protect his waitress girlfriend from a gang led by Jack (Benicio Del Toro) and a mob boss, Manute (Michael Clark Duncan). Things come full circle once events unfold, and surprises are unveiled with seemingly unrelated events and characters linked together.<br/><br/>To say more would spoil a smorgasbord of film noir and stylized action. There are some clever plot twists and surprises along the way. People's loyalties are constantly in question, and the three male leads are surrogate avengers for justice, redemption and salvation. The film's structure is reminiscent of Tarantino's own Pulp Fiction and even P. T. Anderson's Magnolia where various people meet in a series of vignettes and affect others who are seemingly unconnected. There are moments that seem influenced by past films. Certainly Sam Raimi's (Spiderman) earlier Darkman was a direct precursor to Sin City. There is a scene with Clive Owen driving with a corpse that is a sort of homage to the 1945 horror classic The Body Snatchers. Rutger Hauer plays a religious leader in a scene not unlike the scene in Blade Runner where ironically Hauer reversed roles as an assassin in that film. A marvelous action piece with a female samurai warrior has all the earmarks of Tarantino who picks up where Kill Bill left off.<br/><br/>It is fascinating to watch what is essentially a pre-storyboarded film with the graphic novel serving as a blueprint for the film. 'Shot and cut' by Rodriguez himself, the film feels very consistent with a true auteur's vision. Frank Miller imagined it, and Rodriguez made it happen. This is Rodriguez' most assured film thus far, and it is a living, breathing comic book in the best sense. Despite the wide commercial appeal of successful comic adaptations of Spiderman and X-Men, Sin City is perhaps the most authentic and uncompromising transfer of such material. Much of what is depicted on screen is predominantly a fabrication of computer generated special effects and trendsetting photography within which the actors interact. The black and white photography is at times gorgeous and downright nightmarish with the strategically accented color schemes similar to the best shots in Pleasantville and Schindler's List. There is no doubt that the visuals of this film have been achieved with painstaking detail and success. <br/><br/>A dream cast features a wealth of actors and actresses, any two of whom could have front lined separate features on their own. Willis and Owen are quite effective as heroic, yet flawed personas, but it is Mickey Rourke who is a standout in what amounts to a comeback film. Even under his Frankenstein-like makeup, his humanity and toughness shine through. He makes the most of a potentially ridiculous role. In addition, while the males are mostly rugged, disheveled hulks, the females are beautiful and extremely sexy (sleazy?) to say the least. Jessica Alba, Brittany Murphy, Rosario Dawson, and Carla Gugino, (sorely missed from her brief Karen Sisko TV series) sizzle on the screen as they crossover different story lines. The performances are all fairly convincing once you excuse the occasional, awkward voice over narration. <br/><br/>Some things are left hanging plot wise. Many characters are almost caricatures; we have to accept them at face value without much depth. We never fully understand the psychopathic monster that is played by Elijah Wood. Where did he come from and why is he purely evil? Likewise, a partnership, betrayal, and reconciliation at the beginning of the film are never fully explored. The dialogue is a bit Jekyll and Hyde with some hokey lines followed by a series of sharp, humorous ones. <br/><br/>This is a film superficially filled with nudity, explicit language, taboo subject matter, and buckets of bloody violence. This is going to be offensive to many people who are put off by intense scenes of mayhem, but to those who thrive on the film noir of adult comic books, it is a dream come true. <br/><br/>If this adaptation is a one shot deal, the filmmakers gave it their best efforts. It is entirely plausible to have a sequel with an entirely different cast (even though a number of the principles survive this entry.) This movie is a splendid exercise in look and mood with emotional substance, no mean feat. It is definitely not for the faint of heart, but for those who are game, just hang on and enjoy the ride. Ironically, although Sin City is a graphic film in every sense of the word, this tale of haunted characters in an amoral world is ultimately a moral film.<br/><br/>***1/2 out of **** stars only for action comic fans"

(Dirs: Frank Miller & Robert Rodriguez; ""Special Guest Director"" : Quentin Tarantino)<br/><br/>""Sin""fully Good  Makes PULP FICTION look like BEACH BLANKET BINGO; the year's best film (thus far)<br/><br/>Fanboys and novices alike (myself included on the latter classification) will be hard-pressed to be disenchanted with the mega-violent, pulse-pounding, adrenalized realization/adaptation of Frank Miller's cult-classic neo-noir 'graphic novels' of SIN CITY thanks to the visionary genius of Robert Rodriguez for 'getting it'  actually making a film INTO a comic book; arguably the best of its kind and thus far in this anemic cinematic year the best film of 2005.<br/><br/>Miller, who rose to acclaim in the late 80s early 90s with iconoclastic debunking of such cherished comic book superheroes Batman, Daredevil and Spider-Man, has a hardcore fan base who cherish the stark graven images of black and white in his SIN CITY books of depraved justice and injustices alike with anti-heroes newly forged with pitch-black souls beating hearts of gold and soft spots for dames in distress not the likes seen since the hey-day of Chandler and Spillaine with a unique look and no-holds-bar approach to the proceedings at hand. <br/><br/>Wisely Rodriguez enlisted Miller to be a co-director (even if it meant quitting membership to the DGA when he was told Miller couldn't since he wasn't a member ; a ballsy solidarity pact if you ask me) in interpreting the amazing art work to the silver screen by employing literally copying panel-by-panel/frame-for-frame re-creations of the artist's trademark visuals that are etched amazingly on the big screen. Shot in dazzling black and white that glistens and glimmers while splotched with shades of color here and there to underscore the emotions that may be lost in translation, and largely improvised with state-of-the art digital/computer generated effects (practically every background, set piece et al is green-screened ala ""Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow"" but with a better budget and a more seasoned filmmaker that makes all the world of difference).<br/><br/>The film is interlinked with three story lines from Miller's work in the dank dwellings of Basin City (the first two letters scratched out on its borderline welcoming sign giving the title of what it really is) that includes world-weary cop Hartigan (Willis; who else does noble rot so well and with echoes of Bogart to boot?!), who on the eve of his retirement and faced with a recently diagnosed bad ticker, is out to settle the score for a serial pederast in the sickly form of a politico's son (Stahl cannily channeling Peter Lorre) who kidnaps young girls to do unspeakable things to; a shady cat named Dwight (Owen, whose rugged good-looks are on fine display) hell-bent on keeping the peace between his lady, Gail (the deliciously devilish Dawson), the leader of a gang of hookers and the crooked police when bad blood is shed involving a brutal cop Jackie Boy (a barely distinguishable Del Toro having a field day at being a bastard echoing Robert Mitchum in all his squinty-eyed deluge); and sandwiched in between is the best chapter involving a borderline psychotic pugilist with a mug like an anvil meets The Elephant Man, named Marv (Rourke, in a Travolta-comeback plug, arguably the best performance of the film and one of the actor's greatest on screen characters) who wakes up in bed to find the goddess/whore Goldie (the insatiably gorgeous King) dead by the hands of another only being framed by a truly vile menace which leads to an unstoppable pledge on vengeance with one of the most violent on screen vendettas ever committed to celluloid. Rourke, buried under tons of truly incredible make-up, emotes like no tomorrow giving his hulking thug a sliver of humanity even as he's beating the hell out of all who come within his murderous rage-induced journey into hell. <br/><br/>Included are scenes of aforementioned bloodshed of impaling, garroting, cannibalism, decapitations, disembowelments, amputations, shootings, stabbings, and two- count'em  two castrations (to one character!) Be that as it may it is all pertinent to its comic book trappings and underscores the themes of personal justices over the odds often with the do-gooders attempts not exactly coming up roses. Perhaps its nihilism is at an all-time low but in the balance of the grim story lines its only par for the course.<br/><br/>Also on hand are the sexy Alba as the grown-up would-be victim of Stahl's lethal sex predator that Willis' Hartigan is re-united with, Gugino as the lush lesbian parole officer to the grotesque Marv, a spooky silent turn by Wood as Marv's nemesis, Duncan as a thuggishly crooked police enforcer, Hartnett as a silky-smooth hit-man, the stealth-like assassin Aroki, a crusty Booth as the corrupt politician Rourk, a Rod Stieger look-alike turn by Hauer as an unrepentant cardinal and for my money the funniest cameo by Katt as one of Duncan's hench-man who has the most hilarious commentary about a well-placed archery shot.<br/><br/>Rodriguez, who co-wrote & co-directed with Miller (and let buddy QT do one gallows-humor sequence with Owen & Del Toro), also is credited with the superlative cinematography, co-produced, co-scored and edited the film, is a one-man unstoppable maverick of film-making who only seems to be getting better and better with each endeavor and clearly this is his masterpiece in this bloody valentine to noir and graphic novels. <br/><br/>""Sin City"" makes ""Pulp Fiction"" look like ""Beach Blanket Bingo""; one of the year's best films and instant classic in the making."

At first, while viewing the film, you think it's basically a trilogy of 3 stories in a horrible urban environment.<br/><br/>Bruce Willis, as the cop with the heart condition, appears briefly and is resurrected much later in the film.<br/><br/>You can never recognize Mickey Rourke from his battered, broken face on screen.<br/><br/>The violence in the film is unbelievable. Women come off as predators of the worst degree.<br/><br/>The plot is extremely thin and basically non-existent.<br/><br/>Certainly, more should have been spoken about with regard to the corrupt senator."

","this movie is horrible. i can understand why many people would find it interesting, an interpretation of a comic book, a lot of action, and a fast paced story, but these are not the qualities that define a good film. The movie is a trashy crowd pleaser which holds nothing valuable behind its many special effects. it clearly demonstrates the trend of more and more modern main stream films as they fall down the slope from art work to trash. the movie focuses on characters with super human strength, mainly so they can be shot more and more without dying. the film is extremely bloody, violent, and in some senses sexually explicit. this is not to say that these themes should be stayed away from, but when a film takes violence and sex and uses them as tools for mass entertainment instead of for a greater purpose or in a way that adds character, style, and meaning to the film, then the filmmaker has failed at his craft. Overall, this film should be looked upon as a blunder in film-making and it is a shame that this world has lost enough sense and morality to put this film in the top 250."
"matt63","1","3","11","22 June 2005"," Whatever was Quentin Tarantino doing ...
","... getting involved with a movie as genuinely awful as this? He's shown as ""special guest director"" which, I guess, means trying to make something from Miller's appalling script and the infantile sets and cinematography.<br/><br/>First the script ... it ain't one. It's four stories stitched together like Frankenstein's monster. Someone else has commented that the film is just like the comic books. Pretty easy to see why. Frank Miller just posted off a random selection of comic books with a note saying: 'There's the script, I'm off to the beach'.<br/><br/>Then there's the sets and the cinematography from Robert Rodriguez. Think a high school play and you get some idea of the cardboard sets. Then add the completely unoriginal idea that the movie will be in black and white with - are you ready for this? - a dress, a pair of eyes or a face in colour now and again. Result? Drab and boring after 30 seconds. Mindnumbingly tedious after 4 hours (it felt like the movie lasted that long).<br/><br/>And one final comment to get neatly back to the mention of Tarantino. The violence. In 'Kill Bill', Tarantino made killing stylish, exciting and humorous. No such luck here. In 'Sin City', it's brutal, unforgiving and vicious. Come on, Quentin. You're a hero of subversive, on-the-edge, pushing-the-envelope film-making. Why didn't you tell Frank to go home and actually try and write a film-length script? And why oh why didn't you tell Robert that his 'Spy Kids' trilogy doesn't qualify him to shoot movies for the grown-ups?<br/><br/>This is a sad movie. Sadder still, 'Sin City 2' is in production. The only good news is that with the cardboard sets and the appalling direction (""okay, guys, one take is enough because 2-D comic book characters don't need to have depth, subtlety or even character"") it will take only take a couple of weeks to shoot, so the studio won't lose too much money.<br/><br/>1 out of 10 - and only that because a terrific trailer for 'Dark Water' preceded the disaster called 'Sin City'."

Even a normal person would go crazy after this... I really wanted to see Sin City. I love the cast, they're all great actors, all women are gorgeous, but...

","I soooooo did not love Sin City. I was appalled and seriously grossed out by the violence, and the attitudes towards women were very adolescent boy-ish - half naked hotties strolling the streets and they are all available because they are all hookers. Or they are getting beaten up by guys. Or they are being saved by the big strong man. As a woman and a feminist, I am deeply bothered. Argh. I am grinding my teeth. <br/><br/>""But didn't the women kick a$$?"" I hear you ask. <br/><br/>All I saw was women who were allowed by the grace of the men in power to exercise some minor authority within their own hermetically sealed world, and that that leeway was subject to immediate termination if they did something the men in power didn't like. That is not kicking a$$. That is being allowed to kick a$$ at someone else's whim. <br/><br/>The black and white cinematography with splashes of color was pretty cool, but nothing in this world will ever make up for the institutionalized misogyny, and the complete dehumanization of virtually every character. The violence was so outrageous as to be nauseating. I do not need to see blood spurting from stumps or dogs eating someone's legs. That Frank Miller dude has some serious issues he needs to work out and I strongly suggest inpatient therapy at the locked psychiatric ward of his choice."

","If you've seen the trailers for this film and expected that this is going to be yet another comic book movie, then you have definitely come to the wrong conclusion. SIN CITY is a realistically brutal no-holds-barred crime and revenge graphic novel come to life.<br/><br/>This collaborative effort from the creative minds of Robert Rodriguez and Frank Miller takes film noir into an evolutionary direction that can and should be appreciated by many of today's moviegoers.<br/><br/>From the opening title segment to closing its scene, you are quickly submerged into a very dark and corrupt world (like it or not) that many Frank Miller fans have honored through text and illustration for years.<br/><br/>Fans of Robert Rodriguez will instantly recognize and appreciate his brilliant cinematography and editing, which accomplishes the goal in weaving together elements from various Miller stories (such as ""Sin City"", ""A Dame To Kill For"", ""The Big Fat Kill"", and ""That Yellow Bastard"") to produce a very fulfilling anti-hero flick.<br/><br/>This mini-epic also does a great job of getting into the heads and hearts of a few key characters to create a viewer bond that is almost unbreakable until the end of the film. Crowd favorites, such as an aging tough as nails cop named John Harrington (played by Bruce Willis), and the brutish Marv (played by Mickey Rourke) are guaranteed to have you looking around each corner for them as they try to reach their paths to justice. By any means necessary.<br/><br/>That being said it is only fair to warn the more critical viewer that some scenes may seem a bit cold and without morals, but that is because you are in Sin City and that is supposed to be that way. So respect this film for what it is, and save your critiques for that other film down the block that is looking for an academy award nomination.<br/><br/>Favorite Quote: ""I love hit men.

","I'm only one to give input if I really like or dislike something. I felt this movie was horribly done, had a horrible storyline, and the only positive was that it showed a lot of butt and cleavage (but as far as butt and cleavage go you can get better butt and cleavage from a porn flick, so I don't feel that this alone should give the movie any points...per my 1 rating).<br/><br/>This movie is too dark (as in color and brightness), the story line is lame, the ""boobs"" you do see aren't worth the lame story line, and it just sucks, at level 100%. If you're into seeing a few boobs fight, or whatever it is they did, then this movie might be worth it to you. If you want to watch it with your girlfriend and she has some interest in boobs, it might also be worth it to you. If your girlfriend (even if she likes boobs) has a lick of sense and interest in any real entertainment, I'd watch Debbie Does Dallas before watching this movie...with her, or otherwise.<br/><br/>Bottom line is, this movie is lame, all the way around."

","As I scan down the IMDb top 250 I came across the latest example of grade inflation; Sin City ranked 123, two spots ahead of Cool Hand Luke. Let's put it this way; forty years from now it will be obvious that this movie was nothing more than a fart in the wind. It's unfortunate that people leave the theatre all jazzed up and then overrate a movie.<br/><br/>Robert Rodriguez is a no imagination hack. I rue the day that El Mariachi was released. I notice that when promoting the film they didn't say, ""From the minds that brought you Robocop 3 and Spy Kids 3-D"". I know it's a comic book and that means style over substance, but rank the movie accordingly. This is not the 123rd best movie ever made. 5 out of 10."

Just a thought......<br/><br/>I am not upset that this is the case, because Pulp Fiction is one of my favorite movies and I also enjoyed Kill Bill, so this movie was thoroughly entertaining, and I would highly recommend it. Also, is a sequel in the works?"
"aeo","1","2","6","8 April 2005"," Disappointingly boring.
","I give this 1 star out of 10.<br/><br/>I had high expectation when I saw this movie a couple of hours ago because of the high marks given by other reviewers but this movie sucks. In fact, I was so bored that I left the theater after viewing about 75% of the movie. I should have left earlier.<br/><br/>The movie Sin City, as I understand it, was an adaptation of the graphic novel by Frank Miller. For those of you who do not know who he is, this guy is huge in the comic book industry. Although I have not read this series, I understand that it was very popular with the readers.<br/><br/>First, what I liked about the movie was that it was in black and white, for the most part, while using color for certain objects to magnify a certain scene. That's about it for the likes and now the dislikes.<br/><br/>What I did not like about the movie was that it was not one story but multiple separate stories in the movie. The movie was basically stories about this make believe place called Sin City and the crimes that plagues it. This multiple story telling does not give enough time for one to understand the characters of one story before it ends and a new story begins. I think the reason for telling the story in this fashion was to give an overall look at Sin City as the main character in this story. It is an interesting way of telling a story but it was not well done. The only recent movie that I could remember that had similar multiple story telling in one movie was Animatrix, the animated movie about the story of the Matrix. Unlike Animatrix, however, Sin City just was not done well done.<br/><br/>Given that the movie had to show multiple stories within a certain amount of time, some things had to be cut, and in this case it was character development. Each character was flimsy in their demeanor with no distinguishable characteristics.<br/><br/>As for the violence, I know some IMDb viewers did not appreciate the movie because of it but I love gratuitous violence as long as it is placed correctly. However, violence cannot be rampant throughout the movie because then it looks silly and comical, which is exactly how it looked in this movie. As Eddie Murphy once said, his comedy routine is not simply a series of bad words alone, but that there is a story in his comedy routine and that he uses bad words simply to accentuate it.<br/><br/>Food for thought for future story tellers."
"Agent10","9","2","6","4 April 2005"," Robert Rodriguez does it again: his way
","It's become a broken record of late, but Robert Rodriguez is one of the more intriguing film makers in Hollywood. His pizazz and style have simply transcended the rest of the pack and he has made every one of his films an experiment in film making. Just look at Sin City.<br/><br/>Even with completely digital backdrops (something he did in Spy Kids 3) he managed to create an environment that seemed real, and only the most nit-picky person could see the inconsistencies. He also strung together a series of great stories and combined them into one experience that never lacks in punch or pacing. And to do it all with a solid list of ensemble actors and A-List All-Stars makes it even more incredible to watch.<br/><br/>What was especially interesting was the risks Rodriguez took to make this film. Digital backdrops, dropping out of the Director's Guild, going up against countless fans who questioned the idea of making this film, using a large cast, and staying true to the power and brutality of the comics even when he could have sold out and made it a PG-13 film.<br/><br/>Even the actors took risks. Who would have thought Elijah Wood could pull off his role as a sadist, or the two minutes of risqué screen time for Carla Gugino (who caught my attention much in the same vein of Snake Eyes). Alexis Bledel escaping her Gilmore Girls shtick to play a two-faced hooker. Heck, anyone that is still weary of Mickey Rourke could probably put their fears to rest after this movie.<br/><br/>There isn't much to say against this film, but I do wish Rodriguez had taken it to the extreme and just leave the movie in black and white. But who knows, when we've had the time to analyze and dissect this film, it won't even be noticed."
"FilmOtaku","8","2","6","4 April 2005"," Good and gory
","With a cast that rivals a Robert Altman film, Robert Rodriguez's latest film ""Sin City"" is, quite simply, Frank Miller's stories of the same name come to life. There are three main story arcs that intertwine in small ways: Marv (Rourke) a street tough with a rough looking mug goes to bed one night with a prostitute named Goldie (Jaime King) and wakes up with her lying dead next to him. When the police show up at his door a moment later, he knows he's been set up and he sets out to find the killer out of respect for her. In the second story, Dwight (Owen) finds out that Jackie Boy, (del Toro) the ex-boyfriend of his current girlfriend Shellie (Murphy) is not only an abusive jerk, but he is about to go wreak havoc on ""Old Town"", the red-light district of the city where the prostitutes (and his former girlfriend Gail, played by Rosario Dawson) hold court. In an attempt to protect Gail and the others, Dwight finds himself in a really bad situation that could cause a street war to break out, and put the lives of Gail and her girls in great danger. Finally, there is Hartigan (Willis) a retiring cop whose last case is to track down a pedophile, Rourk Jr. (Stahl) who has kidnapped a young girl. Hartigan tracks him down and administers justice, but Rourk's father is a corrupt Senator, and has Hartigan thrown in jail. Ten years later he finds out that Rourk Jr. is up to his old tricks and that his target is the same girl, Nancy (Jessica Alba), now grown up and an exotic dancer with a heart of gold who has been pining after Hartigan since her rescue. Hartigan must now save Nancy again and stop Rourk Jr. from exacting revenge.<br/><br/>There are a lot of characters in ""Sin City"", and for the most part, the stories are fulfilling. I thought the first two were the best, but the Hartigan segment was not very compelling, though it was by no means terrible. There were some fantastic characters (I particularly loved Kevin, Elijah Wood's character, but it was such a bizarre and shocking character reveal that I didn't want to go into it in the summary because it's too fantastic experienced first hand.) The real story about ""Sin City"" is obviously its cinematography and appearance. Much has been made about the ""comic book come to life"" look of the film, but it really is true. As a former comic book fanatic, (though I have not yet read the Sin City series) I was delighted with the presentation. Blood spurts white as well as red against the stark black and white film, blue and green eyes glow from black and white faces, and the eyes of one of the most evil people in the film are obscured by the ominous glare on his eyeglasses. ""Sin City"" is a comic book lover/comic book film geek wet dream, put simply.<br/><br/>This is actually a really difficult review to write, personally because I had to ascertain my feelings about the film without a prejudice I have toward a certain kind of violence. For no clear reason I have a big problem with decapitations and hangings, and unfortunately ""Sin City"" is rife with them. There were times when there were three or four minute scenes when I couldn't look at the screen. But if you don't have a problem with that specifically, you're in businessas long as you don't mind violence, and a great deal of it. I went to the film with six other people and four of them (all Kill Bill fans, mind you) were turned off by the excessive violence, though one of them didn't let that diminish his view of the film. Other than the head thing I was fine, but there was a great deal of slicing, dicing, some cannibalism, even castrations (yes, in the plural sense). Obviously, it is all done in a very cartoonish manner (particularly the scene between del Toro and Owen having a conversation in a car, the scene that Tarantino directed), and even some very violent moments were silhouetted, but the violence is pervasive enough to give me pause about recommending it to say, my parents.<br/><br/>I find myself nearly salivating when I think of how cool the film looked, and if it weren't for certain elements I would certainly want to go see it again; it's kind of like being drawn to shiny things. Though I traditionally am a celluloid purist (I had issues even going to see ""Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow""), Rodriguez, probably one of the more schizophrenic directors we have working today (this is a far cry from Spy Kids, to say the least) really created something groundbreaking with ""Sin City"", and his vision and success with this medium really make me eagerly anticipate more. Without any prejudice, this film gets 8/10.<br/><br/>--Shelly"
"shaquanda36","8","2","6","4 April 2005"," Problems with narrative structure mar beautiful surface
","Sin City is truly revolutionary. It is a stylistic masterpiece. The visuals are amazing in their blend of film noir, comic book styling, and use of color. This is the first time a comic has TRULY been brought to the screen.<br/><br/>Unfortunately the narrative structure allowed this otherwise flawless movie to falter.<br/><br/>The Sin City graphic novels are a collection of separate stories which occasionally loosely relate all in the place of Basin City. Each of the major characters of the film (Marv, Hartigan, and Dwight) have their own Sin City novel to stretch their arms in. Each is a story unto itself with its own beginning, middle, and end.<br/><br/>Sin City the movie contains three of these individual novels under one heading ""Sin City."" The film's director, Robert Rodriguez, opted not to do the film in an episodic fashion...or did he? This is where the film falters. He could have chose to do three individual episodes, each beginning with its own individual title: Marv, Dwight, Hartigan. But Rodriguez chose not to, instead he wanted to film a single, cohesive whole. This could have worked. But it was haphazard. Instead of having the stories weave together, he left the Marv and Dwight stories as episodes, split the Hartigan story in half to bookend the episodes, and did something with Josh Hartnet to bookend the bookends. The trouble with this is that the audience starts to search for meanings and connections as soon as Hartigan reappears. And the dots did not connect - just opened more questions.<br/><br/>I left the theater blown away by the visuals, but wondering if there was meant to be a greater story. I thought it might be the Roarke family...but the Dwight story had nothing to do with that. I thought it might be the prostitution community...but the Hartigan story did not deal with that.<br/><br/>In the end, it felt like a movie that should have been episodic but had delusions of cohesion. Were the visuals not so amazing and the adaptation so reverent, I would give this a 5/10. But all things considered I give it an 8/10."

"say_andy","9","2","6","3 April 2005"," If you were a fan of the Sin City books and you didn't love this movie, then you should just stop going to movies altogether
","To say that Sin City is the most loyal adaptation of a comic ever is a bit of a misnomer, since ""adaptation"" isn't quite the word I'd use to describe what Robert Rodriguez and Frank Miller were able to accomplish here. ""Adaptation"" suggests that they changed things from the comic in order to adapt it for the film. Instead, all they did was put clothes on a few of the characters, cut out the odd scene, and squished 3+ books together. Other than those small changes, Rodriguez basically just filmed the comics. He didn't just follow the plots, or the stories, or the characters, but also copied the dialogue word-for-word, and matched the shots panel-for-panel. Even if Miller wasn't present for all of shooting, he would have earned his co-director credit since his comics were the storyboards for the film. Rodriguez didn't decide where to put the camera, Miller did back in the 90's when he wrote and drew the books.<br/><br/>This is as loyal a re-telling of any previous format, be it comics, novels, musicals, or an old film, that you are ever going to see. Future films can only match what Sin City did here, not surpass. If you were a fan of the Sin City books and you didn't love this movie, then you should just stop going to movies altogether. Because there is obviously no pleasing you.<br/><br/>Visually, this film is a landmark accomplishment, and should contend with summer blockbusters like Episode III, War of the Worlds, The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, and Fantastic Four for visual effects Oscars. Some may argue that the film sacrifices substance for style, but to do so would miss the point. In Sin City, style IS the substance. Everything, from the use of black and white, to the hard-boiled dialogue, to the scantily-clad (and un-clad) ""dames"", to the violence and grit, is a nod to true film noir. The film is about the mood and feel as much as it is about the three stories it contains.<br/><br/>I was completely blown away by the movie, and had it concentrated more on the story than the style, I doubt I would have even been interested in seeing it at all. I'm not usually into ultra-graphic violence, but I was completely enthralled. The movie was harsh, grim, visceral, action-packed, sexy, and shocking. And I loved every second of it.<br/><br/>To be fair and balanced, this is a straight-up guy film. The wife HATED it (as I kinda figured she would). She thought it was visually interesting, but other than that, just a sick mess of violence, cheesy dialogue, and gratuitous nudity. Which is actually a fair assessment of the film. But she says it like it's a bad thing. Although, I will admit, that was pretty much my initial reaction when I read the original Sin City series (that makes up a third of the film) back in high school.<br/><br/>The only minor quibble I had with the film is that Bruce Willis doesn't quite fit the Hartigan character he was cast as. He does a fine job, but is unconvincing as a 60 year old with a bad heart, even less convincing later on as a 68 year old man. I think Clint Eastwood was always the inspiration for Hartigan in That Yellow Bastard, but there's no way he was going to be in this movie. Sin City actually follows Willis' career pattern of following a string of poorly-received action movies with a part in quirky movies by up-and-coming directors. He spends most of his time making himself culturally irrelevant, until a Quentin Tarantino (who directed a scene in Sin City with Clive Owen and Benicio del Toro from The Big Fat Kill), M. Night Shyamalan, or now Robert Rodriguez comes along and rescues Willis' career.<br/><br/>I give the movie 9 stars and want to see it again. And then many more times after that."

I haven't read any of Millers graphic novels, so I guess I don't have much to say about the story, but I think as far as a movie, if it didn't have the effects it would have been a lot like other movies with multiple story lines. Something akin to Once Upon a Time in Mexico, or Pulp Fiction. Sin City was cool, but the effects made the movie. The Benicio del Toro and Clive Owen sequence was my favorite part of the film. I think the worst sequence was the Bruce Willis part. It just seemed lacking. I will definitely have to pick up some of the Sin City GN's and check them out. The style seemed to be represented well in the movie. Maybe in the future somebody will make a movie out of Ted McKeevers work. I think his style would suit the big screen.

","I had a feeling I was going to hate this movie, and I was right. I only watched it in the hope that I would be pleasantly surprised, but nope... I disliked it just as much as I thought I would. The only positive point I have to make about this film is how it looks. There's no doubt that this film has style in abundance - it's a visual feast. In fact, the visuals were the only thing that kept me watching.<br/><br/>Everything else about 'Sin City' I didn't like, from the wafer thin storyline to the ridiculously over-the-top violence. I normally don't mind violence in films but the violence in 'Sin City' was excessive to the point where it became totally meaningless. So, all in all, not my type of film at all. 'Sin City' oozes style but offers nothing in just about every other area."

","If film noir was not a genre, but a hard man on mean streets with a lost lovely in his heart and a gat in his gut, his nightmares would look like ""Sin City."" The new movie by Robert Rodriguez and Frank Miller plays like a convention at the movie museum in Quentin Tarantino's subconscious. A-list action stars rub shoulders with snaky villains and sexy wenches, in a city where the streets are always wet, the cars are ragtops and everybody smokes. It's a black-and-white world, except for blood, which is red, eyes which are green, hair which is blond, and the Yellow Bastard.

"Takethispunch","10","1","2","15 January 2017"," Awesome .
","Much of the film is based on the first, third and fourth books in Miller's original comic series. The Hard Goodbye is about a man who embarks on a brutal rampage in search of his one-time sweetheart's killer, killing anyone, even the police, that gets in his way of finding and killing her murderer. The Big Fat Kill focuses on an everyman getting caught in a street war between a group of prostitutes and a group of mercenaries, the police and the mob. That Yellow Bastard follows an aging police officer who protects a young woman from a grotesquely disfigured serial killer. The intro and outro of the film are based on the short story ""The Customer is Always Right"", which is collected in Booze, Broads & Bullets, the sixth book in the comic series."
"gavin6942","8","1","2","5 December 2014"," A Visual Achievement
","A film that explores the dark and miserable town, Basin City, and tells the story of three different people, all caught up in violent corruption.<br/><br/>Although the use of digital filming and CGI is very contentious, Robert Rodriguez found a way to make it work to his advantage in a way that may not have been possible with traditional film. The way the black and white brings the noir to life, blending smoothly with the rare other colors... it is the only way to bring a comic book to life. (A similar style is in ""The Spirit"", which does not get nearly the respect it deserves.)<br/><br/>This casting is incredible, as it is varied and really brought the best performances out of Alexis Bledel, Rosario Dawson and Jessica Alba that their careers ever had. Mickey Rourke was re-invented, and this may have been one of the last great Bruce Willis roles. Such a powerful film."
"Gordon-11","Null","1","2","21 August 2014"," Not my type of film
","This film tells the story of the people in Sin City, and their violent and corrupt ways of life.<br/><br/>I wondered what a graphic novel was, it turned out it is a film with a lot of narration like a novel has. Instead of describing with a scene, they describe with words. It's an interesting concept, but the story doesn't work for me. The violence is so over the top that it made me laugh. The scene of a man with an arrow through his body is completely hilarious, and I'm not even sure if that's the intended effect.<br/><br/>The black and white effect with some specks of color may be cool at the time of release, but by now I have seen it all before so I am not as impressed with it as I expected. One thing I was very impressed with was Jessica Alba's dancing. I knew she could dance from the film ""Honey"", but this time she can really dance amazingly.<br/><br/>""Sin City"" will appeal to some, but not to me."

","Robert Rodriguez adapts graphic novel series. The movie definitely has a Gothic noir feel to it. The movie is shot in black & white but selectively colors certain things in, sort of like how Schindler's List used colors. The movies conjures up a delightfully dark, grimy, and gritty atmosphere to go match the depravity of its subject matter.<br/><br/>Very interesting cast of actors with all of the actors being spot on in their roles especially Mickey Rourke as Marv and Bruce Willis as Hartigan.

"Jakealope","3","1","2","18 December 2011"," Style over Substance, Gore, Violence, Corruption & Cynicism for Their Own Sake
","First off, I am no fan of Frank Miller, but I imagine most of the ravers for this film are. Okay, I can understand when a ""writer"" gets his ""book"" made into a film, his fans cheer regardless. 2nd, I like Rodriguez, he is a technically good fun director of clever action films. But Rodriguez is an acolyte of the king of cult gore, cynicism, pop culture exploitation and excess himself, he who must not be named.<br/><br/>But this film can't be a great, or even a good film in my estimation. There was nothing beautiful about it, in it's ugly setting of a worn out industrial city. Someone rendering comic book panels to story board drawings into film via green screen is not art, but mere technical work. It was ugly scenery, ugly people, ugly plots, tons of gratuitous violence, dialog that can only be described as a parody of noir genre. The actors were good, since they had the money & influence to get talent, but all for naught. There were no interesting lessons, exotic locations, fascinating plots or even a hint of moral lesson beyond it is up to damaged but good people to mercilessly exterminate evil ones. Revenge 101.<br/><br/>Watching documentary movie reels of Nazi and other totalitarian atrocities may have a guiginol appeal to people, but they are not entertainment, but they serve as a moral lesson about following evil political/religious faiths to their final horrible ends. Or even atomic bomb and firestorm damage to Axis cities serve as an example of better countries who resorted to horrible means to destroy worse ones. But this had none of that. We don't get just pedophile priests here, but cannibal ones. The corruption, nihilism & evil here were almost childishly displayed as the cynicism was dime store; whores of the heart of gold variety are as cliché as they get.<br/><br/>There is no scene, plot point or character here that I haven't seen before in a more real & human setting. It is just pure sleaze & violence to the point of just being vile."

","""Sin City"" is infested with criminals, crooked cops and sexy dames, some searching for vengeance, some for redemption and others, both.<br/><br/>The film incorporates story lines from three of Miller's graphic novels including 'Sin City,' which launched the long-running, critically acclaimed series, as well as 'That Yellow Bastard' and 'The Big Fat Kill.' Where Hartigan, a cop with a bum ticker and a vow to protect stripper Nancy.<br/><br/>Marv, the outcast misanthrope, is on a mission to avenge the death of his one true love, Goldie.<br/><br/>There's also Dwight, the clandestine love of Shelley who spends his nights defending Gail and her Old Towne girls from Jackie Boy, a dirty cop with a penchant for violence....<br/><br/>One of the best comic book adaptations out there is really a difficult movie to recommend. It's not your standard Hollywood movie, and the fact that it's three stories, which are all intertwined, could be a little too 'Pulp Fiction' for some.<br/><br/>But this is a pure male, fan boys movie, which could be one of the most subliminally sexist films ever. The majority of the women here are depicted as weak, and the ones who do have power, are either prostitutes or dancers. But thats where the typecasts end, because ironically the females are some of the most interesting characters in the whole movie.<br/><br/>The men are the dinosaurs in this movie, from Marv who should have been 'born in a different time' right up to Clive Owen, who is straight out of a film noir from the forties.<br/><br/>The Ensemble cast is the most impressive one i have seen, and every single person is at the top of their game. From Bruce QWillis putting his best performance in years, a huge comeback performance from Rourke, to Elijah wood who can only be described as terrifying.<br/><br/>The effects are straight from the source and it's almost like the comic book coming to life. Hartigans story is easily the best thing about the film, The precious Father/daughter relationship is tested, but it's the most human thing you'll see in this movie, perhaps thats why Roarke is that way, to make it that little more insane.<br/><br/>Every film has a weak part, and although the performances are great, the Clive Owen/Del Toro section is overlong and a little too bloated for my liking, but it's still interesting to watch.<br/><br/>A marvellous piece of art, Rodriguez has never been better, and one thinks that he will never be as good, because this is phenomenal stuff."

I just thought that the stories themselves were nothing special. I liked the parts with Bruce Willis, they were the most entertaining. The parts with Josh Hartnett were just pointless. The story following Micky Rourke was half decent. The one that ruined it for me was the Clive Owen one, mainly because of his terrible American accent, but also I lost interest half way through.<br/><br/>I bought this on Blu-ray for £10 and to be honest I should have just bought it on DVD for cheaper, because I'm now left disappointed."

The mesmerizing graphic frame images of the film are so scintillating & wonderfully shot in dark tinted images with sharp contrast of B&W & highlighted flashy digital Colors that you can't stop praising Rodriguez for his creative camera touch & it's really very difficult to judge - who's the real full length director of the film - Tarantino or Miller. Because not only the look of the film (blood gushing graphics) but the rough narration style & the dialogues (read: slangs) gave me the feelings of watching Tarantino flick. The plot is set against a morally bankrupt sin city where cops are corrupt & streets are deadly with goons. Out of three narrations, its Bruce Willis story of an old man & the girl (whom he had saved twice & forever) stays something like a plot in the film. But it's not a plot which is so important here'Oz it's splendid graphic film noire. The movie has pretty glamorous star cast stuffed with Willis, Jessica Alba, Clive Owen & Mickey Rourke.

","Sin City is an inimitable movie; some group will like it while some will simply hate it.This movie is based on Frank Miller's Graphical Novel of the similar name.The movie covers three stories knotted together to give the feeling of completeness.

What makes this movie so unique is that it is made in High quality Black and White with some colorization on certain portion of the scene giving it a polished look. This new approach has really made this movie very special; though the movie consists of enough blood and gore, the presentation has made it some what lighter.<br/><br/>This movie carries with itself a likable story, if you like movies based on graphical novel, then you can give it a shot."

The whole black and white with some random colors added really made some scenes jump out at you. Hartigan was well played by Bruce Willis, the part was just right for him. Michael Madsen was excellent as the shadey Bob, although he could have used some more screen time. And my favorite, Clive Owen as Dwight McCarthy. Clive Owen is ALWAYS good in every movie I see him in. He always manages to make his characters really cool yet mysterious at the same time. This movie was unrealistic and all of that, but you don't watch movies like this for the realism. You watch because they're FUN. I give this a 9/10. Good movie, Robert Rodriguez."
"departed07","10","1","2","21 January 2008"," Not for the weak or easily queasy.
","I'm a fan of comic books and superhero movies, but never had the pleasure of reading any of Frank Miller's graphic novels of Sin City or 300. With this film however, I can rank in with my other favorite comic book movies but for those who enjoy watching Batman Begins or Spider-Man 2, it's not for the very easy queasy.<br/><br/>Frank Miller and Robert Rodriguez direct this movie with Quentin Tarantino as a special guest director with an all star cast featuring Jessica Alba, Alexis Bledel, Bruce Willis, Michael Clarke Duncan, Michael Rourke, Clive Owen, Rosario Dawson and others where if you've seen the directors films from ""Desperado"", ""Pulp Fiction"", or ""From Dusk Till Dawn"", you're in for a real nice surprise.<br/><br/>""Sin City"" uses three stories from the comic book series, each telling three different points of view connecting all the characters in one rotten city.<br/><br/>The first story is about Marvin portrayed by Michael Rourke, a grunge man who is framed for murdering a stripper and not knowing about it. The funny thing is he's asleep when it happens. So Marvin goes all over town asking bad-ass hookers left and right where he meets one played by Carla Gugino. They go in search for the murderer where they realize that a cannibal (Elijah Wood) and a priest are involved.<br/><br/>The second story tells the story of Dwight (Clive Owen) who finds out that the girl he is seeing (Brittany Murphy) is dating a corrupt cop named Jackie Boy (Benicio Del Toro) who beats the hell out of Brittany Murphy's character and wants revenge. Dwight doesn't exactly kill Jackie Boy, but instead a group of hookers (the same ones Marvin met) led by Gail played by Rosario Dawson, kills Jackie Boy after his posse tries to harass one of the girls. Dwight and Gail are in shocked once they find out that the cop is connected with the rest of the good and bad officers along with the mafia in the city and if they find out that their own was killed, all hell will be broken loose.<br/><br/>The third story shows Hardigan's (Bruce Willis) point of view as a washed up cop whose been out of the force after an incident involving a young Nancy Callahan (an older version is played by Jessica Alba) and the senator's son (Nick Stall) where Nancy was kidnapped before Hardigan saved the day by injuring the senator's son in places he can't grow; not until his partner played by Tarantino regular Michael Madsen injures him leaving him almost dead. The story involves Hardigan going in the line of duty to see Nancy one more time before realizing that her life is in danger.<br/><br/>The film is shot in black and white where the only colors that show are detailed items from blood, pens, vehicles and anything that isn't human.<br/><br/>Nonetheless, this is a one of the coolest comic book movies from Frank Miller to come up on screen while i stand by my decision when i say this is not a typical comic book movie."

When you've got so much fun on display, some OTT violence, black humour,sex, nudity, oh did i mention the dames are HOT, and the movie looks so cool .

"zardoz-13","10","1","2","17 June 2007"," This Sinner Is A Winner!
","The amazing thing about the new Robert Rodriguez movie ""Sin City"" is that the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) gave this brutal, bullet-riddled, blood-splattered, sadomasochistic, misogynistic, black & white crime fantasy an R-rating. An NC-17 rating would have seemed more appropriate. The mean-spirited murders and mutilations mount into the double-digits, and the mayhem that occurs with predictable regularity throughout its 2-hour plus running time is more than enough to fill two or three movies. About the only thing that isn't savage about this slickly-made synthetic saga is its theme that love motivates some men to sacrifice their lives for their women. Not only does this hard-boiled melodrama replicate panels from the Frank Miller graphic novel series upon which it is based, but also Rodriguez grafts live actors onto computer-generated sets with a visual artistry that eluded last September's ""Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow."" ""Sin City"" ranks as a tour-de-force triumph for both Miller and Rodriguez in terms of its fidelity to the source material. The pared down, spartan looking way that Rodriguez stages the larger-than-life heroics here will inevitably generate imitators, especially in the direct-to-video market. Imagine Rodriguez's ""Desperado"" crossed with Todd MacFarlane's ""Spawn,"" and you'll have an idea what to expect if you haven't seen the ads. Although the bullet-to-the-bone action escalates to new levels of intensity, ""Sin City"" layers its ultra-violent action with gallows humor and irony. Characters survive barrages of lead, plunges from high places, cars hitting them, and other miraculous feats that would make Rambo wince. Presumably, Rodriguez obtained a benign R-rating despite the abundant violence in ""Sin City,"" because he exaggerates its brutality. All the women, for example, are busty, bare-breasted, blonde babes who dress like strippers and cradle automatic weapons. While it is based on the Miller novels, ""Sin City"" owes its imagery, plots, and violence to the cynical film noir thrillers from the 1940s. Indeed, Rodriguez takes the violence to Hong Kong action levels but treats everything like a Roadrunner cartoon. People stand around with arrows shot through them and talk until other arrows silence them. One man tears the genitalia off another as if he were picking berries, and a woman slices off the top of a villain's skull with an airborne martial arts weapon as if she were opening a can with a machete.<br/><br/>The Frank Miller and Robert Rodriguez screenplay recreates the clichés and conventions of those aforementioned film noir thrillers with a reverence that reeks of nostalgia. Not only does the dialogue bristle with macho Mickey Spillane man-talk, but also the voice-over narration has a philosophical Raymond Chandler ring to it. Essentially, Miller and Rodriguez tell three tales of woe set in an imaginary Sodom and Gomorrah called Basin City. ""Sin City"" occupies an unspecified place in time, rather like Walter Hill's 1984 cult classic ""Streets of Fire."" People drive jalopies from the 1940s as well as tricked-out, contemporary European sports cars. The guys prefer trench coats and heavy artillery, while the gals appear straight out of Frank Frazetta paintings with a penchant for Victoria's Secrets lingerie. In the first, Marv (Mickey Rourke of ""Johnny Handsome""), a two-time loser with a heart, wakes up in bed with a dead hooker, Goldie (Jamie King of ""Bulletproof Monk ""), and finds himself up against armies of gunmen determined to frame him for her demise. Believe me, you won't forget the scene here when he plunges a thug's head into a toilet bowl that hasn't been flushed. In the second, a cop with a bad ticker, Hartigan (Bruce Willis of ""Pulp Fiction""), tangles with a psychopathic pedophile (Nick Stahl of ""Terminator 3"") over innocent 11-year old Nancy Callahan. Eventually, Hartigan goes to prison to keep the villains from learning about Nancy's whereabouts. After he serves 8 years, Hartigan meets a grown up Nancy (Jessica Alba of ""Honey"") and discovers that the sex deviant that he thought he had dealt with is back for more skullduggery. In the third, an indestructible private eye, Dwight (Clive Owen of ""King Arthur""), intervenes between trigger-happy policemen and a horde of gun-toting hookers led by sexy prostitute Gail (Rosario Dawson of ""Kids"") after a corrupt cop (Benicio Del Toro of ""Traffic"") is gunned down. Wrapped around these three unsavory sagas is another yarn about a deceptive looking hit-man (Josh Harnett of ""Pearl Harbor"") who never misses his mark.<br/><br/>The story goes that the Directors Guild of America busted Rodriguez out of their union because he gave co-director's credit to comic book artist Frank Miller. According to Rodriguez, Miller's artwork provided him with a storyboard to follow, so he considered Miller as his collaborator. Miller didn't physically direct any of the scenes. Meanwhile, Quentin Tarantino called the shots on a scene or two, but his contribution is so seamlessly integrated into the whole that it doesn't call attention to itself. Although the bulk of the mayhem appears in sharply drawn black and white, Rodriguez dabbles with other colors occasionally, such as red for women's lips or blue for a woman's eyes. Occasionally, characters bleed in different colors. For example, the pedophile bleeds yellow blood. Nothing in ""Sin City"" is remotely believable, but credibility was never Rodriguez's the goal for this high-octane, slam-bang shoot'em up. The heroes behave acceptably heroic and sometimes die for their heroism. The villains emerge as repellent as you will find in any gritty action thriller. Mickey Rourke's Marv, who resembles Kirk Douglas from ""Spartacus"" on a lifetime supply of steroids, qualifies as the most memorable character. British actor Clive Owen proves his credentials as a cool action hero. A variety of familiar faces pop up in some of the least expected roles. ""Lord of the Rings"" hero Elijah Wood plays a Hannibal Lector-like cannibal/serial killer. Audiences that crave action movies with girls, guts, and gore will find this glossy black and white tribute to Frank Miller's graphic novels and film noir thrillers of yesteryear engrossing."

","Sin City(2005) <br/><br/>Review: Another comic book adaptation. This is Sin City. Frank Miller's graphic novel is alive. Here's my take: <br/><br/>Sin City is about three stories taking place around Basin City featuring many strong characters, Pulp Fiction style. The first thing I noticed is the incredible likeness to the Sin City graphic novels is flawless. From the sleek black and white with the occasional color here and there is glorious. The cinematography is breathtaking. We get some excellent Film-Noir as well. The narration is fitting and makes the experience more enjoyable and cool.<br/><br/>Sin City does not hold back on the violence. This movie is really violent. You will see blood for blood by the gallons. The action here is well done and satisfying. But, this is more about the storytelling and the characters.<br/><br/>All of this goes down to three compelling stories. We get Frank Hartigan, a detective on the verge of retirement who is intent on stopping the bad guys no matter the cost. Marv, an ex-con who is out to get the ones who killed the woman he fell for at any means necessary. And Dwight McCarthy, who is standing up for his new girlfriend against a truly unsavory character.<br/><br/>Another plus is the tremendous cast. We have a major talent pool to swim in. From Mickey Rourke, Bruce Willis, Jessica Alba, Powers Boothe, Elijah Wood, and so many more. All of em are marvelous. My favorite ones are Mickey Rourke and Elijah Wood. The voice acting of the narration is truly satisfying. This is excellent Film-Noir.<br/><br/>The directing was great with a nice special direction from Quentin Tarantino. Robert Rodriguez and Frank Miller do Sin City just right in all the right ways. Miller's vision of the Sin City to the silver screen was done perfectly.<br/><br/>The Last Word: Walk down the right back alley in Sin City and you can find anything. This is One of the best movies of 2005. From a terrific cast to quality dialog, an excellent script, and a fantastic look, this is very close to flawless. A work of art."
"timhayes-1","5","1","2","12 February 2007"," Visually speaking, a triumph
","Robert Rodriguez's adaptation of Frank Miller's graphic novel series Sin City is to put it mildly the best looking damn movie ever. This is pure eye candy folks. Filmed in a quasi B&W style with certain items coloured to shine importance on them, the film is a treat for the viewer. Everything looks amazing. Stylistically speaking, Sin City very much resembles the comics that it is based upon. Partly this is due to the fact that Rodriguez's co-director on the film is comics creator Frank Miller. This is not Miller's first job in film however as many may remember(or not) seeing his name on the script for the third Robocop film. At any rate, he's gotten far more creative control this time out thanks to his co-director being such a huge fan. First off you may notice no screenplay credit. That is because the film follows the comics so closely that this is literally the truest adaptation that you will ever see. Literally it comes down to whether or not you enjoy this type of film that will determine whether or not you like it. Personally I found it engaging, although parts were better than the whole. I thought Marv's story dragged on a bit too long and didn't enjoy the prologue. I would have liked to have seen more of Hartigan though. The actors are all fine. Its also fun to pick out characters as they pop back up later on since the film is somewhat disjointed much like Pulp Fiction. And speaking of Quentin Tarantino, fans can flip ahead to a scene in a car between Benicio del Toro and Clive Owen for his guest directing spot. All in all, it was great to look at but at times can drag."

","""Sin City"" is a modern day classic. Stylish, beautifully crafted, with an all-star cast and action scenes galore, this is a terrifically entertaining movie that takes Miller's tales and puts them well and truly on the big screen in a faithful and successful way.<br/><br/>From the moment the film started, I was glued, awestruck, to my seat. ""Sin City"" looks beautiful, its pace is spot-on, and there's a real hook with the characters and plot. I didn't want the film to end - I've not had this much fun viewing a film since ""Pulp Fiction"".<br/><br/>There's so much talent in this film, it's difficult to single out individual performers. Mickey Rourke's Marv is perfect casting. Watching this movie, you feel he was born to play this role. It's superb to see Rourke back on the silver screen despite his features being near-impossible to recognise.<br/><br/>""Sin City"" has quite a high gore quotient and will appeal to those who like their comic-book violence splattered all over the screen. There are some terrifically over-the-top sequences and genre fans will be in their element watching this movie again and again.<br/><br/>As near perfect as a comic-book adaptation will ever be. 10 blazing stars out of 10."

","That's all I can say about this film... cool, with a capital 'C'. Robert Rodriguez and Frank Miller really worked together to bring this film to life. Even if you haven't read the graphic novels that this film is based on, you'll still be amazed by the style of it.<br/><br/>The film consists of three stories and one short: The Customer is Always Right, The Hard Goodbye, The Big Fat Kill (my favourite) and That Yellow Bastard. Each story has a brilliant cast and a great storyline. My favourite performance is Elijah Wood as Kevin, because he really brought out the 'silent killer'-type profile into it.<br/><br/>This is one of my favourite films, and it will be yours too. Highly recommended!"

","SIN CITY is the definition of perfection. From someone who's read the entire series let me tell you no movie before this has ever come so close to its source material. The writer Frank Miller was there every step of the way during the production of this. Nothing was allowed to be in the film unless it had Millers approval. Rodriguez had to convince Frank Miller that the movie would be made true to the graphic novels the whole way. The casting in this is amazing. Everyone looks some what alike if not exactly alike their characters. You can read the graphic novels almost exactly along with the movie. Its like each picture came to life as you watch it. Its as hardcore and gritty as the books and never apologizes for anything. This movie turned me into a hardcore comic book fan. I've read all seven stories from Frank Millers SIN CITY now and can't wait for them to get going on a sequel.

","When I first heard Robert Rodriguez was directing Sin City I thought there was no way it would be any good. I wasn't a huge fan of his work. Not by a long shot. But then Frank Miller came on board and the movie became the greatest comic book film of all time. I'm a devoted reader of Frank Miller. His work is legendary. This movie is a complete and total extension of his artwork and his vision. It's incredible. I can't get enough of this film. I really can't. And just seeing Marv on screen, a massive tank of unstoppable strength and toughness, running through Sin City like an immovable tank was worth the 10 bucks alone. But then those moments where Bruce Willis actually looks like Hartigan, I got chills."
"The_Amazing_Spy_Rises","10","1","2","30 July 2006"," what every comic book/graphic novel movie should be
","Forget Spidey. Forget the Bat. Forget the Fantastic. Don't even think about the Hulk. The best film based on a comic book or graphic novel is this one right here, 2005's best action film, 'Sin City'. The most alluring thing about Sin City is that, unlike EVERY comic book movie out there, it has the guidance of its original creator in the driver's seat. The film also is different in that it has 3 directors. Most of the film is by Robert Rodriguez, who does a phenomenal job, making me forget that he did Spy Kids oh so long ago. Frank Miller is also a director of the film, and well, you know it's going to be good if the creator of the stories is also a director. The third director is Quentin Tarantino, who directs one of the coolest scenes in the film. There is no writing, mainly because the film is a TRANSLATION of the comic books, not an adaptation. Miller and Rodriguez actually filmed every scene of the books, scene for scene, then cut it down. The editing and cinematography are simply stunning. You would never know unless you read it that some of the actors, despite sharing scenes, never even met each other. Shot in mostly black and white with the occasional red, blue, or green here and there, Sin City gives you the true gritty feel of the stories. The thing that will attract the non-readers of Sin City to watch this are the incredible action sequences and gory violence that will have you gripped to your chair the whole 2 hours. The best thing about it is the stellar and HUGE cast of men and women you'll recognize right away. Here's the big names of Sin City: Bruce Willis, Jessica Alba, Rutger Hauer, Mickey Roarke, Michael Madsen, Nick Stahl, Elijah Wood, Rosario Dawson, Clive Owen, Alexis Bledel, Brittany Murphy, Benicio Del Toro, and Josh Hartnett. Also in there are actresses you may not recognize, Devon Aoki and Jaime King. The originality of the movie is awesome. Remember, this is not meant to be a film with intertwining stories, but in fact, each story is separate from the other. For example, despite being two of the more important characters, Clive Owen and Mickey Roarke never interact, and the same goes for Benicio Del Toro and Bruce Willis. Others, like Jessica Alba and Brittany Murphy, are in a few of the stories. The film is a stellar piece of film-making that is just breathtaking and amazing. It is definitely one of the top films of 2005, actually, it's in the top 5 for me. The DVD is PACKED with bonus features that will make any comic book nerd drool and praise the lord for this gift. It's amazing, so make sure you don't miss Sin City.<br/><br/>10/10 --spy"
"jcanettis","9","1","2","30 July 2006"," Ultra-Violent, Weird, But Still a Great Experience!
","In general, I utterly dislike films containing too much violence. The ""Tarantino school"", as I call it, is for me a cheap way to try to catch the viewer's attention by using unnecessary and disgusting gory scenes. In the same way that other directors try to draw our interest by using nude or sexy scenes (these at least are much more enjoyable to watch!), the ""Tarantino school"" tries to make its point by bombarding us with ever more blood: Unfortunately, as far as I am concerned, the end result is usually to become fed up and stop watching, just like I recently did with ""Kill Bill"".<br/><br/>And yet, ""Sin City"" was different: Although ultra-violent (a typical scene for example shows Mickey Rourke chainsawing somebody's hands and feet and then giving the rest of the body to a wolf which rips it off!), it still manages to convince us that this raw violence is a vital part of the nature of this generally eccentric film, and not an addition put in just to catch our attention. ""Sin City"" is the adaptation of a violent comic on screen, and as such, violence comes naturally in the flow of the movie.<br/><br/>A movie which is weird, so to say: As I said, it is an adaptation of a comic (which I haven't read, by the way) on-screen, and as such, it is something between a comic and a film, or both. With its black-and-white footage, containing colorful objects in several instances (red blood, green eyes, yellow person, etc.) thus making them much more distinct and powerful, ""Sin City"" is a different experience to watch. Diefferent and great, thanks to Miller's and Rodriguez's great work! Although it features many A-class names, such as Bruce Willis, Mickey Rourke, Clive Owen, Rutger Hauer, and others, acting is of lesser importance here: We are not interested so much in the characters and their performances, but in the overall magic atmosphere. This does not mean that the ""Sin City"" actors are doing their job well: On the contrary, their performances are fine. It is simply that the focus is elsewhere...<br/><br/>""Sin City"" is film that should not be watched with a full stomach, as it will take you for a tough ride. And yet, do not miss this ride! 9/10."
"malekith99","6","1","2","6 July 2006"," A Gothic show of ultra-violence.
","It's not a conventional movie. It's mixing comic book style with splatter B-movies with film-noir elements. The result is a Gothic show of ultra-violence. The characters are bizarre night creatures living in the sin under a non-stop heavy rain and stormy weather. Incredible camera angles, specially in scenes over the roofs of the skyscrapers. Comic action in the fights, the car chases and the acrobatic movements of the characters. A good tribute to Frank Miller (the man who transformed the Daredevil Marvel comic book). Predominant black and white on grey landscapes but plenty of deep red over the scenes. If you like comics, it worths. It's not recommended if you dislike the kind of Sci-Fi stories with people resisting more than five bullet into the body."
"native_girl333","10","1","2","28 June 2006"," 21st Century Film Noir Classic!
","Just incredible! Finally a comic book story which rocks! The Sin City creator Frank Miller teamed up with hot directors Robert Rodrigues and Quentin Tarantino who moved the dark but edgy comic book story to the big screen. Rodrigues even resigned himself from the Assosiciaton of film directors so that ""Sin City"" could have three director mentioned in the credits. ""Sin City"" had to been very important to it's makers.<br/><br/>The movie is based on the great graphic novels ""The Big Fat Kill"" and ""The Yellow Bastard"" of the Sin City-series. The movie is a fantastic way to celebrate the film noir traditions. They used a special ""green screen"" technique to create the Basin City. The world is wholly artificial. The movie is basically black and white but it shows hints of red, yellow and blue colors.<br/><br/>The movie combines a couple stories; a human-hater Marv (comeback star Mickey Rourke) is accused to have murdered the extraordinarily beautiful hooker Goldie (supermodel Jaime King); ex-photographer Dwight (Clive Owen) takes down a dirty cop and tries to cover it up; a hard boiled copper Hartigan (Bruce Willis is on a mission to save and protect the young Nancy (Jessica Alba) from the maniac child molester Yellow Bastard (Nick Stahl). The movie provides some nice supporting characters like the psychotic man-eating man played by Elijah Wood etc..<br/><br/>""Sin City"" is brutal but gorgeous film about love, hate and revenge. It is funny and flourishes with a lot of black humor. The film is something you have to see over and over again. Absolutely brilliant! 10/10"
"StayPuft003","9","1","2","8 June 2006"," Yeesh!
","Sin City, directed by Robert Rodriguez, is one the most stylish and best movies I have ever seen. Not a second is wasted on screen, and the black and white gives a very dark atmosphere to it all. Great performances from the three main leads, especially Mickey Rourke. There was lots of hype about it, and he deserved it. This film was very violent, but it just added to the fun of it. There is humor, gore, nudity, and everything else in between. The characters are radical and the cast is amazing and well-acted too. There are so many moments in this movie where you think to yourself ""Wow, this is on of the coolest things I've ever seen"" if not the coolest. The dialogue is good and pretty believable, and each story feels authentic. To wrap it all up the only thing I can really say is this was one helluva film."
"jokercard88","8","1","2","3 June 2006"," violence never looked this good
","First off, there's a couple of things this movie perfects ten times better than any other movies ever released. The sometimes poetic yet sometimes tough narrative that runs throughout the whole movie is without a doubt the best I can recall ever hearing in a movie. The stylized violence (And believe me it's worse than Quinten Tarantino's TRUE ROMANCE) is the most brutal and cool looking violence ever. This is heightened by the also stylish black and white and red all over animation. And the best moments that the two things collide is when the violence that really pushes the envelope is censored by a scene when the character and the blood is plain white and the background is100% cell shaded black.<br/><br/>However,the plot is a mixed bag. When the movie begins, the incredible narrative and animation blow you away. fifteen minutes into it and it was the best movie I ever saw. However, thirty minutes later, it still felt like the introduction. The shifting back and forth through characters and the constant murders never slowed down. While the narrative was still incredible, the beginning of the plot would never give way. <br/><br/>Later on however, and I was enjoying myself once again the violence was even better and the unpredictability over who would make it on top this time made me truly enjoy the movie again. The violence was bloody and the gun fights between characters was unpredictable as even ten shots to the chest would not kill even the lesser important characters (meaning only the cops).<br/><br/>And the last link in the plot of the movie was probably the best part (besides the stunning beginning) as the character at the start, Bruce Willis's character (my favorite of the three narrative characters) selflessly saves the lead female character.<br/><br/>so with perhaps the best presentation value and an unpredictable plot, this movie is definitely worth seeing."
"gobbles_the_penguin","9","1","2","18 May 2006"," Style
","Talk to anyone who has seen Sin City and the one thing they will talk about (whether they enjoyed it or not) is the aesthetic style of the film, with the whole movie being shot in front of a blue screen. This movie is definitely in the top 3 Comic book movies ever, simply because it's so faithful to not only the story of the graphic novel, but also the visual style.<br/><br/>The movie is very dark, even sinister, providing the very same atmosphere that the comic book had, and the colours (when used sparingly, mainly for emphasis) are illuminate and beautifully used. My favourites are the Yellow Bastard and the coloured dress and hair of Goldie.<br/><br/>The actual story isn't the strongest feature of this film, but in saying that, there are some great stories in there, and every one leaves you with an emotion, the exact emotion you were intended to have. Clive Owen and Benicio Del Toro are two of the finest actors in the world, and they take the second story by the throat and dominate it with great performances. Oh, and I did enjoy Jessica Alba's role, needless to say I am a heterosexual male.<br/><br/>In short, Sin City is a success, must see for all comic book junkies, or action fans who don't mind a bit of black comedy"
"m_viknaraja","9","1","2","7 May 2006"," very slick
","this is an excellent film. do not recall seeing something like this ever before. It is a dark film. There is no colour in the film, except for specific parts, such as girls eyes, red for blood and car headlights, etc. This adds a wonderfully dark feel, almost in a comical way. The film is very much similar to the format of a comic or computer game. The special effects aree reminiscent ofexplosions in action games, even better, and more fluid. The acting is very suitable, andthe main guy, has a very eery tough guy look. Definitely perfect for the part. He is covered with scars on his face, and is large in size. Yet he seems to have a soft nice side. But, not want to mess with.<br/><br/>The are some great female performances. Some thin, tough girls that add a beautiful touch to the film. They are not to be messed with. There is great use of leather in the film, which adds to this slick and eery look. The scenes, include warehouses and dark alley ways with minimal light. This almost feels to an area for a street fight, which is exactly what this film is. Although portrayed in a much less brutal, common fashion.<br/><br/>i believe there is a computer game called sin city. It is probably like a street fight , type game. Probably very good, given the outcome of this film.<br/><br/>This can be highly recommended, for its originality and quality visuals and special effects. The story is also very exciting and full of depth and character. Watching it several times, will likely open up new layers of the film, to the way the light moves in the background, to the sound of gun fire."
"Matt_Layden","9","1","2","6 April 2006"," ""Sin City Joins Die Hard and Fight Club As One Of The Ultimate Guy Flicks""
","Sin City tells three different stories, one which involves a dead hooker and a big thug. The other is filled with hookers left right and centre, a bad cop and one super cool dude. The Last story centres around a yellow bastard and a young hot stripper. These stories all take place in Basin City from the creative mind that is Frank Miller.<br/><br/>Sin City had a trailer that I could watch over and over and never get bored of it. The film is the exact same way, only it's 10 times more fun. Sin City is based on the graphics novels by Frank Miller of the same name. Other then the fact that one is a book and the other is film, with some more bits of colour here and there, they are basically the exact same thing. Sin City joins Die Hard and Fight Club as one of the ultimate guy flicks and manages to become the best film of 2005.<br/><br/>Robert Rodriguez makes great films, see From Dusk Till Dawn and Desperado, but every now and again he misses a step, Spy Kids 3-D and The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lava Girl. Here he makes his best film yet, mixing in great visuals, incredible music, the perfect cast and one hell of a good time. Everything fits perfectly for Sin City and it never misses a beat. With Rodriguez behind the camera and Miller by his side for more creative input, Sin City not only becomes the best film of 2005, but one that will go down in history.<br/><br/>Each story is unique for it's own merits and makes you want to re watch it over and over again. ""The Hard Good-Bye"" and ""The Big Fat Kill"" stand out over ""The Yellow Bastard"" simply because they contain more action and move along quicker. That is why I can't give Sin City a perfect ten, The final act, which should go out with a bang, goes out on a depressing soft whimper. It does shock the viewer if they are not familiar with the work it is based on.<br/><br/>What makes Sin City stand out from the rest of the films that came out in 2005? Well, aside from it's amazing visuals, it has the perfect cast. Mickey Rourke is back and is back big, with a bang, however you want to put it. Rourke got seriously overlooked by every award show, he became what he was suppose to become, right down to his chin. Del Toro shines in his role as Jackie Boy. Even the smallest bit of make-up that will make the role more believable helps and Del Toro knew this and wanted to make it as perfect as possible, he pulls it off. Clive Owen is super cool, as he is in almost everything he does. He just emulates it, although it does help that DWIGHT is super cool as well. They blend well together. It took me awhile to get passed Bruce Willis because everything I see him in, I don't see the character, I see Bruce Willis. He manages to pull it off, although it may take time to get use to him. The supporting cast help flesh out the film even more. Seeing a familiar face here and there is a treat for the audience.<br/><br/>The films character were great, from the big brooding Marv, to the small agile and creepy Kevin. These comic book characters are brought to life by these actors and only in a world as imaginative as Sin City could these character exist and here they kick ass to the next level. Rodriguez creates his own environment and world for that matter. Much like Jackson did with the Lord of the Rings, and Lucas did with Star Wars. Rodriguez brings paper to screen and has made a world in which we will definitely see more stories evolve from.<br/><br/>The music is beautiful. Rodriguez has an ear for music and uses it to it's full potential here. From the theme music that everyone loves to hear and gets excited about when they hear it, to the opening score. It fits the genre well. The visuals were interesting to see. The entire film was shot on digital, so the crisp look of the black and white is even more crisp then you would think. With dabs of colour here and there, Sin City catches the eye and makes the viewer glued to the screen.<br/><br/>City is not for the faint of heart and is not exactly the first choice for date movie. The film contains some pretty graphic scenes, like decapitations, castrations, electrocution, explosions, stabbings, gun shots wounds, axe wounds, dog eating man wounds,and everything else. The bullet, the babes and the blood comes everywhere in here and if you enjoy this thing, as I do, then this is a film that you will definitely want to check out. Sin City has balls and it's not afraid of what it wants to show it's viewer."
"sarmadasco","9","1","2","29 March 2006"," Not One Minute Wasted
","Firstly, let me say clearly that I hate violent movies and until recently, with the exception of the 'Kill Bill' films and 'Pulp Fiction' which I saw for the first time just recently, I was a fanatic ""NO GUNS EVER"" in any film I saw. This film, 'Sin City' is against everything I believe in but the film, in all its gore and violence and schmaltz, makes me not care about my rules. The first time I saw it, I was intrigued and it took me about 4 times until I finally saw the whole thing and put it all together. I love the dialogue, the way these characters use the most melodramatic lines from old film noir films and present them in a way that makes it all so normal. You definitely know the prose are in the mode of old films but it fits so well in its black and white (except when they show in color or techno white where someone has been shot or decapitated or had an arm ripped off) setting. It is just so dramatic! It drags you into its story lines happily and perhaps feeling guilty that you are enjoying it so much. You end up liking the hookers in 'Old Town' and the way they got and keep their independence. It is an old time movie, hating the bad guys and loving the good guys and gals and forgiving them their sins as their ultimate ideal makes them forgivable. Everything fits into this film. Every 'method', type of dialogue, scene, actor, cinematography...they all fit together into one great film. The actors, and I point out specifically; Clive Owen, Brittany Murphy and Rosario Dawson are perfect. Murphy is a doe eyed 'bad girl with the heart of gold' that uses her dialogue like a caricature (as this whole film is) of the films of the 40s. Dawson is superwoman and Owen is wonderful in all he does and soon will be huge in this country. He has the 'tude, looks, manner, etc. to be anything from James Bond to Satan (which he does in this film)and back again! One must have a stomach for the most graphic violence, from cannibalism to brain dicing. I could go on but cannot. It is a great film and cannot wait to purchase it! If you are in therapy, give it to your therapist and then have a session discussing your feelings about this film, as psychologically, this film tells you a lot about ones psyche!"

I'm not a conservative person- and i can get along with all of the violence and lewdness in movies (Kill Bill and American Psycho are two of my favorites) - however shouldn't there be point to the graphic nature of a movie. The violence acted as fluff to a movie lacking in a cohesive plot and good acting (sorry, alexis bledel- you need to stick to the WB).<br/><br/>This movie never got passed it's shock value stage with me.

","Parents beware: this two hour and ten minute thrill ride is not for the young ones. Frank Miller's Sin City graphic novels leap to life in what is, in my opinion, the most cinemantographially beautiful movie, that I have ever seen. The movie is artwork, frame by frame, only strengthened by the all-star cast you must see to truly behold. Mickey Rourke is acclaimed by all who have seen it, but I believe that Bruce Willis and Clive Owen turned out very, very good performances as well. The acting, even though the lines are extremely cheesy here and there, is superb; it was easy for me to picture Willis as an old cop or Josh Hartnett as a hit-man(he did well, even in his 90 seconds of screen time.)Every molded into Miller's fictitious world perfectly. The three seedy tales the movie portrays are all interwoven in an intricate time frame many don't understand. The atmoshpere is topped off with the constant narration of the main character currently being followed, and it is more than idle commentary. It's truly a sad, sad shame that Rodriguez had to resign from the DGA in order to have the film properly done, for it surely would have won a few Oscars. The only complaint is the soundtrack(or lack thereof.) There are two songs used in the movie!"

","Robert Rodriguez's best directed film by far. This movie contains excellent acting, incredible plot, and amazing special effects. A must see!!! The casting is superb. It includes veteran actors such as Bruce Willis Michael Madsen and Mickey Rourke, and then you have young superstars such as Jessica Alba and Rosario Dawson. The first time I've seen this film, I was always on the edge of my seat. In my opinion, Robert Rodriguez and Frank Miller directed a perfect comic film. The soundtrack fits perfect with movie. This movie is nothing but a great movie. Watch on cinemax,hbo, starz, buy it on DVD, whatever it is, you wont regret it."
"Da_Piscator","10","1","2","20 February 2006"," One of the Greats of 2005
","Looking back to the movies of 2005 I can only remember a few movies that I really enjoyed. At the top of the list just above Star wars episode III and King Kong is Frank Miller's Sin City.<br/><br/>This movie was so incredibly unique in so many different fields it was unbelievable. In particular i enjoyed the uses of color in this movie. I liked how the ""Innocent Girl"" had blue eyes, and the ""Good Cop's"" flashlight showed a clear light. This use of colors was an excellent illumination device that kept me very interested the second time I watched this movie.<br/><br/>The Second thing I enjoyed about this movie were the incredible characters. Though I love Bruce Willis' and Clive Owen's past work a true tip of the cap goes to Micky Rourke. His portrayal of Marv is simply astounding. Marv's thug attitude and almost inability to die made him definitely the comedic backbone of the movie. Also the action scenes involving Marv were powerful and hard hitting. I can go on to name the many great actors/actresses and their portrayals in this movie, but I would surpass my 1000 word maximum.<br/><br/>This movie is probably in my top five favorite movies of all time. Robert Rodriguez managed to create a real winner here."
"jc990608","10","1","2","16 February 2006"," Best comic book adaptation ever.
","Over the years, comic adaptations to the big screen have either ranged from dismal failure (Captain America, Catwoman, Barb Wire) to solid yet forgettable (Hulk, Daredevil, FF, Elektra) to mind-blowingly fantastic (Spiderman 1&2, Batman Begins, X-men 1&2).<br/><br/>But I can safely say that Sin City is, without a shadow of a doubt, the most 'PERFECT' adaptation from paper to the big screen ever produced. The attention to detail was phenomenal in every frame AND character, seriously, you could have just handed out a copy of the novel for the cast to read and it would have been just as effective as a script, or possibly moreso since the novel provides the graphic nature that a script just can't duplicate.<br/><br/>If you ever get the chance, pick up a copy, you won't be disappointed."

","Despite my score, the film is not flawless, but it is close enough to it to merit such a score. I saw this twice on the big screen, and countless times on the special edition DVD. it is a masterwork of technology and style blending together to create a noir hell of an environment. each episode connects and yet stands alone. repeated viewings are vital, of both versions, in order to understand and appreciate all that it contains. The strongest element in the film would have to be the visuals, and then, surprisingly, the acting. it's truly amazing the depth and life that Bruce Willis, Mickey Rourke and others bring to their roles. if I have any complaints about the film, it is that I wanted more, and we the audience will get that in the forthcoming sequels. the film begins with a mans voice-over begins, accompanied briefly by a delirious jazz note, and continues through a scene straight out of a pulp fiction tale, before diving into the Marv sequence. I had trouble deciding which tale was ""the best"" and have settled on the idea that each one is equal to another, and simply different. The Marv sequence is a classic murder-mystery Revenge tale, while The Big Fat Kill is action and the final tale falls somewhere in the realm of bitter love. each is extraordinary, and each is supreme in execution. The lighting, the makeup, and the special effects-which one can argue is the whole film-are amazing. the last comment comes from the fact that the majority of backgrounds and sets in the film exist only in the realm of digital code. Even certain characters are on-screen concurrently only through the same process. simply incredible and an intriguing glimpse into the future of film technology. Aside from Batman Begins and Road to Perdition, I have never seen a graphic novel or comic book brought to the screen as well as Sin City has been. a triumph on every level."

","I'm not going to say much more than what everyone else has said about this film. Most faithful comic book adaptation to date. And yes ... best performance of Rouke's career. <br/><br/>I was a bit worried about this film. I've been a huge Miller fan since 1988 and I know what works on paper doesn't work on film. When I saw the pics of Yellow Bastard and Marv, I just didn't know what to think. Really didn't know it was going to completely take the look of the book and use it. And I'm not one of those people who loathed Robocop 2 ... I actually thought it was a pretty fun movie. But the third Robo film was completely terrible, and I fault that on the script written by Mr. Miller. I wasn't sure what people who weren't familiar with the source material would think about the movie. Well, it turns out that it works well whether you've heard of Marv and Goldie or not. Objectively, it's just a great beautiful looking film. Completely unique, violent but fun.<br/><br/>The scene with Bruce Willis in the jail cell is really haunting. It just looks like he's suspended in time, the worse kind of limbo and the viusals really help us connect with what he's going through as the years pass."
"Heltevir","10","1","2","9 February 2006"," The most incredible comic book movie ever!
","I'm sure Frank Miller wept at seeing this- not out of misery of a botched movie- that the mood and poetry of his comics were so perfectly captured and put on screen. If Batman was done in this style I think I'd die of absolute bliss.<br/><br/>This has to be one of the most mind bending nervy keep you on the edge of your seat movies that I've ever seen. You really aren't sure what's going to happen next or how one serial is going to tie into the next. The acting is phenomenal! And the directing has to be the best I've ever seen. Every scene sang and stood out beautifully. There were no lags or lapses of boredom. No ho hum bits to go get popcorn or go to the bathroom during. If you left you missed some integral bit that you'd surely kick yourself over.<br/><br/>This movie is a dark little diamond. Enjoy it. Laugh. Gasp. Once its over it's like coming off a roller-coaster: dazed and elated."
"lambiepie-2","9","1","2","5 February 2006"," What a Fantastic Film!
","I've have got to go on record to say that this was one under-rated film when it comes to the film industry patting itself on the back.<br/><br/>Technologically speaking, this was a marvel. Creatively speaking, this was very creative. This is a rare film of bringing to film a mixture of elements together that makes you WANT to watch, and an ensemble of actors and actresses that make it work.<br/><br/>Over a decade ago, Oliver Stone put together his version of ""Natural Born Killers"". Although it was only a fraction of Quentin Tarrintino's original tale, it was the film itself that made me take notice. Every element known at that time was used to bring to the screen a frightening tale. I feel the same about this one.<br/><br/>A mixture of film noir, live comics, color, action and story, this was one of the films that was a refreshing change in what has been placed out there. Violent, you betcha. Adult themes? Above and Beyond. A film homage to the comic itself.<br/><br/>To put something like this on the screen you need to cast the appropriate actors....and the casting, for the most part, was the best. Bruce Willis was great, the usually annoying to me Jessica Alba did a good job here, Clive Owen is just a buzz to watch on the screen, Benicio Del Toro shows why he is a breakout actor...supporting roles of folks like Rutger Hauer, Josh Harnett (who'll show you he's just not another ""pretty boy for the movies""), Brittney Murphy, Nicki Katt, Carla Gugino (a very underrated actress!), Jamie King (just wonderful!), Powers Boothe (chillng!), Elijah Wood (scary!), Michael Madsen were all the bomb.<br/><br/>But the two that will definitely stick with you are Nick Stahl and Mickey Roarke in his best performance in YEARS. These actors and their characters were the best and had me on the edge of my seat.<br/><br/>The only actor that wasn't that exciting to me was Rosario Dawson - could be because she didn't have much to do in this one....and I kept thinking of a parrot every time she came on screen and not about the tough character leader she was supposed to be.<br/><br/>But even with that, this film was still the best. A must not miss for anyone interested in film, a gem for the fans of the comic series."
"brando647","10","1","2","1 February 2006"," One of my top favorites...
","Robert Rodriguez scores again! This man is neck-and-neck with Quentin Tarantino as being my favorite filmmaker. It seems like the man can't fail. This time around, Rodriguez brings Frank Miller's film noir graphic novel series ""Sin City"". For those wondering if you need to be a reader of the books to enjoy the movie, you don't. I went into this movie blind when I saw it in the theaters and it blew me away. The movie actually inspired me to start reading the books.<br/><br/>The movie is a collection of stories from three of the graphic novels. I think this is where some viewers got confused. A lot of the people I spoke with regarding the movie didn't care for it because ""it didn't make sense"". People need to know: don't go into this expecting a two-hour, single plot movie!! It is three stories, independent of each other, that share the same characters. In this way, it is like Tarantino's ""Pulp Fiction"". Another concern people have with the movie is the gratuitous violence and sexual themes. This movie may not be for people who are easily offended by such things or are made uncomfortable. You need to watch this movie with an open mind and just try to enjoy the stories.<br/><br/>And of course, you can't discuss ""Sin City"" without mentioning the stylized look of the film. The movie is gorgeous, shot almost completely against a green-screen and using digital backgrounds. The use of the green-screen also allowed Rodriguez to do some amazing lighting that could not be achieved through conventional film-making. It gives the movie a look that hasn't been seen before. After reading Miller's first book in the series (""The Hard Goodbye"", which is also the first story in the movie), you can see that Rodriguez stayed as true as possible to the look in the books.<br/><br/>Finally, I have to mention the casting. I couldn't imagine a better cast to play these characters. You can tell the actors/actresses really got into their characters and had a great time playing them. They all gave strong performances and brought these characters to life perfectly."

I have watched it like a million times and it doesn't get boring every time.lol. Also the movie has also such a cool cast and it just makes a great movie. My favourite character in the movie is definitely Hartigan played by Bruce Willis. I think that the idea of the film being in black and white makes it interesting and unique and unlike any other films released in 2005. The action in the film is really fast paced which makes it extremely stylish."
"GarryJohal","7","1","2","29 January 2006"," Graphic Novel was better
","Even though this was a good movie, it just didn't have the bite that Frank Miller's graphic novel had. i guess it just shows that most times, when a novel, comic or graphic novel is represented is a film format, it has to be adjusted for that very medium. for example, the novel TRAINSPOTTING, is very different from the movie, yet both the film and the book managed to capture the essential essence of what trainspotting is about. there's a similar feel, even though they're differently presented. you can't really turn an acclaimed novel into an excellent film by copying it word for word and converting that into film.one has to transform it to fit the medium of film. because what works in written word may not work the same way on film;unless of course its some rubbish that Dan Brown wrote, which reads more like a movie script than a real novel anyway. one example that springs to mind when i think about the Sin City film, is that scene where the wolf is taking a bit out of Kevin. It's almost an exact replica of that scene in the graphic novel, same picture almost. Yet in movie format, it really does not deliver as much of an impact as is does in the graphic novel form. However, i have to say that my bias is a result of my having read the graphic novel before seeing the movie, thus there were certain expectations involved. There was already a certain standard in my mind that the movie had to achieve for it to be worthy of the graphic novel in terms of quality. If i had done the opposite(seen the movie first then read the graphic novel) i might have a different opinion. however i think its important to remember which came first. The movie is merely a copy of the graphic novel, however it is in the graphic novel that the originality and genius lies."

","Sin City<br/><br/>""Walk down the right back alley in Sin City and you can find anything,""-including one of the best movies of the year. Few comic book movies have looked as good as Frank Miller's Sin City. This film brings a comic book to life in ways that we haven't yet seen in cinema. From the unbelievable imagery that fills each and every scene of this movie, to the actors who brought each character to life, and the three intertwining story lines that keep us on the edge of our seats, Frank Miller's Sin City is a movie experience you don't want to miss and may never experience again.<br/><br/>This film is brought to life on screen with three of the original Sin City comic book stories. The three main story lines concern Marv (Mickey Rourke), an outcast on a mission to avenge the death of the one woman who treated him right; Dwight (Clive Owen), a good guy, who spends his night trying to protect Gail (Rosario Dawson) and her Old Town girls from a crooked cop and the mob; and a battered old cop named Hartigan (Bruce Willis), who vows to protect a sexy stripper. Each story holds its own among the others as we find ourselves switching from one to another, much like in Quentin Tarantino's masterpiece, Pulp Fiction. In fact, this film seems to be a lot like Fiction. Tarantino is a special guest director who directed one brief scene for the film and also seems to have influenced much of the films style and violence. The stories of each of these characters are so well done that we begin to believe what we are watching to be possible in this comic book world filled with violence. Each story is told through both the eyes and narrative of its main characters. It's a very interesting way to tell a story, but it's wise. At Sin City's pace, a two-hour, one-story narrative would begin to wear on its audience.<br/><br/>Every scene of Sin City looks like it came right out of the pages of a comic book. The more you watch, you begin to wonder if you are still watching a movie or flipping through the pages of one of Frank Miller's comics. The dark city is brought to life not with colors, but incredible CG graphics. Everything is composed of black and white, except for a few details that have been filled with beautiful colors that we can't miss. It's a type of style and imagery that carries the film almost by itself. You could watch this movie for the first time with the volume on mute, and still walk away amazed. The tag team direction of Robert Rodriguez and Frank Miller are the brilliant minds that allow us to find ourselves just looking and almost forgetting to truly watch and enjoy the entire aspects of this film.<br/><br/>Frank Miller's Sin City is brought to life with a cast of Hollywood stars that never seems to end. Even the smallest of roles are brought to life by big budget actors such as Josh Harnett and Elijah Wood. The acting that caries the movie, however, comes not from these small roles, but from the main characters of each of the three stories. Bruce Willis looks every bit a great film star of old in black-and-white. Clive Owen is intriguing as the one good guy in this city we find ourselves caring about. The one role that steals the show is Mickey Rourke as Marv. He gives one of the best performances of his career and gives us the best narrative voice we have heard since Tom Hanks in ""Forrest Gump"".<br/><br/>After seeing Frank Miller's Sin City, I had no words to explain what I had just seen. It wasn't just another movie; it was different from anything I had seen before. It was a ground-breaking experience I didn't expect. I have never seen a movie use its elements so well and let it take us on such a wild and crazy ride. A ride you don't want to miss and have got to experience, but isn't suited for everyone. This is definitely not a movie that you want to bring your kids to, or want to watch if you can't take violence. It's rated R for a reason, but the violence is done with such unique style that it doesn't take away from the film. Go rent this film, or else you won't know what you're missing out on."
"jaysilentbob37","9","1","2","21 November 2005"," The most visually stunning film of all time!
","Sin City. It's a city where criminals rule everything, because the government is made up of criminals. It's a place where violence awaits at every turn. The movie consists of 3 story lines, all set in this dark city. Most people in these stories are brutally, and explicitly killed in various gruesome ways. In other words, this city is not where you go for a family vacation.<br/><br/>The first story, ""The Hard Goodbye"" follows Marv (Mickey Roarke). He is a big, ugly, and sadistic brute who just had a one night stand with a hooker named Goldie (Jamie King). He wakes up to find her dead, and is framed for her murder. He goes on a murderous rampage in trying to find the real killer. This chase leads him to a remote farm, where the killer is revealed. But is Marv strong enough to take him down? <br/><br/>This is a VERY disturbing story. It has some of the most sadistic killings ever shown on film, particularly what Marv does to Elijah Wood's character, Kevin, and what he does to a cardinal (Rutger Hauer). It is also really cool. The blood in this story flows red. Marv, I guarantee, is not the kind of guy you'll want to meet in a dark alley. He kills without mercy, and is good at it. He is what is called a sympathetic monster, like Frankenstein's monster. He is good, but he does awful things. The acting from Jamie King couldn't be much worse. She delivers her lines in the cheesiest way possible. I didn't let that one lousy performance ruin my good time. This is what I would call an action-packed horror story. Also, you get to see the mom from Spy Kids' breasts.<br/><br/>The second story, ""The Big Fat Kill,"" follows the comic book series' main character, Dwight McCarthy (Clive Owen). He is a ladies man, with a criminal record, and a bad attitude. While protecting the old Town hookers, they accidentally kill a cop, Jackie-Boy (Benicio Del Toro). This murder, if the cops find out, will end a truce that has held Sin City together for years. Can Dwight dispose of all the evidence before the authorities get a hold of it? <br/><br/>This story is the most action packed of the movie. It features a really disturbing scene between Jackie-Boy and Dwight in a car, which was the scene directed by Quentin Tarantino. It also has the most story. The only problem is that it doesn't make too much sense at times.<br/><br/>And the third story, ""That Yellow Bastard,"" follows John Hartigan (Bruce Willis). He is the only good guy in Sin City, whose life goes down the drain after he rescues a little girl, Nancy (Jessica Alba), from a sadistic child rapist. He returns 8 years later, only to find that the same killer is after her. Can Hartigan get to her and save her on time? <br/><br/>This is more of a tragic love story than an action. It has a little action, but is mostly a character study between Hartigan, and Nancy. It is definitely the most heartfelt of all of them, and has an ending that could make a strong man cry. Jessica Alba isn't a very good actress, but Bruce Willis, reprising his traditional character as a hero cop, is top notch. The ending to this story is sad, because we probably won't ever see his character in another story again.<br/><br/>This movie is not only a perfect comic book adaptation, but it is Robert Rodrieguez's best film. It has an insanely cool visual style, blending black and white with color in a flawless fashion. It almost doesn't feel like you're watching a black and white film. Quentin Tarantino guest directed one scene, and that scene, of all of them, has the best use of color. All the color splashes are beautiful, and could be freeze framed, and hung in the museum. The trailers make this look like a big, fun, loud, exciting, popcorn action movie. It sort of is, but what the movie really is, is a disturbing, and depressing drama with a grim and downbeat atmosphere. It has plenty of action, but not quite enough to fit the genre. It leaves little hope for the characters in the end. All in all, I say watch this film. It is the most fun I've ever had while watching a movie, and I can 55% guarantee that's how it will be for you, if you're okay with extreme violence.<br/><br/>Sin City is rated R for Sustained Strong Stylized Violence, Nudity and Sexual Content Including Dialogue. Sex: 7/10 Violence: 10/10 Swearing: 4/10 Drugs: 6/10"
"MidnightWarrior","5","1","2","7 November 2005"," The good, the bad & the ugly.
","It's amazing how quickly films are moving off the big screen and onto DVDs. Sin City, of course, is no exception.<br/><br/>Anyone who watches this film should be forewarned that it contains countless scenes of extremely graphic violence, brief nudity, and moderate sexual dialogue.<br/><br/>Sin City is a true work of art. Frank Miller, Robert Rodriguez and Q. Tarantino all did a fantastic job giving this film direction. The cinematography, misc-en-scene and sound are all noteworthy. Assembling a fantastic ensemble cast of actors makes this film really enjoyable (most notably Brittany Murphy, Bruce Willis, Jessica Alba, Clive, the guy who played Marv, Rosario, Goldie, Elijah Wood, Nick Stahl, the Gilmore girl, etc.).<br/><br/>Unfortunately, Sin City really doesn't quite fit in on the big screen. It's a film Noir, without a doubt. Eye candy? Absolutely. Suited for the big screen? Eh, maybe not. There are several elements of this type of script that make this film better suited to being a video game.<br/><br/>For starters, the graphic violence is childish, gruesome, extremely graphic and all a bit senseless. Tasteless, if you will. The vocal narration, though superb and cleverly written, is best suited to the pages of a comic book or even a one player video game (like Max Payne). The camera angles and CGI used in the film belong in a PC game.<br/><br/>The presentation of the movie is not like any other comic book adaptation. Every shot is presented as it is in drawn in the comic book. I suppose this is okay because it's different and this is based on a graphic novel, but I couldn't help thinking how fantastic this would be if it was as a PC video game. With that said, it's fair to say that the script, itself, is not traditional Hollywood narrative.<br/><br/>Essentially, the movie contains three stories that don't quite interject with each other as properly as they could have or should have. You have the first story of police officer Hartigan (Willis) on the last day of the job, out on a last mission to rescue a small child eleven year old Nancy (Alba) from the clutches of a child molester (Stahl) who happens to be the son of a powerful, yet corrupt senator. Willis manages to save the girl, but is betrayed by his parter, and injured with gunshot wounds. Before we can ask what happens to him, we are thrust eight years into the future and come across Marv (some kind of medicated freak).<br/><br/>This is the beginning of the second story about a freak medicated patient (Marv) who falls in love with a whore named Goldie. As they lay in bed, Goldie is murdered and Marv swears revenge. Marv goes on a bloodthirsty hunt to find the killer of his lover Goldie. Marv travels through a series of people, most of all who he kills. Eventually his journey leads him to two blood thirsty cannibals who spare the heads of their victims and eat the bodies. Bleech! What happens then? You'll have to rent the movie to find out.<br/><br/>The last story is about a sweet girl (Shellie) who's boyfriend unleashes psychotic fury on his girlfriend's ex boyfriends/attackers. Again, more senseless, graphic violence that doesn't really do anything except make the audience realize how brutal humans can be to one another.<br/><br/>Out of all three stories, I really enjoyed the Willis/Alba story. It was bittersweet and more of a love Noir that had tremendous amount of potential. Frank Miller could have spared us the violence of the second and third stories and, instead, further developed this one. Using his techniques of black & white, the elaboration of this story would have made for an even more remarkable and incredible film.<br/><br/>So because of the diligent work of crew and cast (especially Brittany Murphy, Bruce Willis and Jessica Alba's fantastic performances), I give the film 5/10 stars."

","Sin City undoubtedly has a good premise.The revolutionary visuals,the A list cast, Rodriguez as director,and the fact its a comic book adaptation,due to the success of Spiderman etc.However this isn't your average comic book adaptation. Put simply,Sin City is sick.Alright,there's probably a lot more gruesome stuff out there I haven't seen yet,but i'm not the most easily repulsed person and I thought it went a bit far.Don't get me wrong,I don't object to a scantily clad Jessica Alba,or even a disgusting yellow guy,but the cannibalism and blows to parts of the anatomy better not mentioned here were just too much for me.To only mention this when reviewing the film however would be unfair though.Good performances come from Bruce Willis(yes,this is somehow possible),and perhaps Alba,although the sheer amount of stars on show mean some parts are clearly limited,such as that of Elijah Wood,who doesn't have a line,or Josh Hartnett.The story itself is OK,but it is difficult to take the film as a whole as the story is split into three,an understandable drawback of the adaptation from book to film.Basically three different characters pursue justice or love in a city filled with vice. Overall,Sin City is definitely something different and has its good points ,but is a bit too gruesome."

I can appreciate the comic book feel but this is quite possibly the most overrated film I've ever seen. Well second only to De Palma's Scarface of course. I was apprehensive to watch Sin City for fear of holding it against the extremely talented cast. When I finally broke down to watch it I counldn't have been more disappointed. Not even the gorgeous women including that of Alexis Bliedel, James King, Carla Gugino, and Jessica Alba could save this poorly written and poorly acted computer generated pile of trash. It's worth noting Jessica Alba, attractive as she may be, is exceptionally terrible. The best part of this movie, besides it finally ending, is trying to figure out what I hate the most about it. Was it Nick Stahl looking like the creature from 'Mac & Me', was it Jessica Alba awkwardly making out with Bruce Willis, was it the lack of chemistry between Rosario Dawson and Clive Owen, was it Brittany Murphy attempting to act,or was it the horrible voice overs from Rourke/Willis? Yeah it was all of those things. Elijah Wood was good... he didn't talk. I'm gonna go watch Dick Tracy now!!! At least everyone admits that one's bad!!!"

","After reading reviews here on IMDb I had some great expectations on this movie. I love movies like pulp fiction where you get to follow several characters and in the end you understand how it's all connected. Before I continue I must just note that I'm not familiar with the series at all so I might have missed details fans didn't. Where I'm getting at is the fact that I have a hard time to connect all the different sub-stories. When I left the theaters I felt... empty... there wasn't any ""aha!"" feeling... the characters never met, they all seemed to be involved in their own story and there were hardly any connection between them.<br/><br/>The violence was just silly. I'm not sure if that was the point, but I just sat there amazed at how they got shot over and over again and never died.<br/><br/>The movie is filmed in a very unusual way, mostly a sort of black and white. That felt very refreshing and made the movie feel like more than it was, beautiful. Sin City is everything but beautiful though, so don't let it fool you."
"dc_follies","7","1","2","6 September 2005"," Good, but overrated
","The lighting, direction and effects in this movie were all tremendous. Simply put, there is no way that this movie could have been made 15 years ago because the special effects would not likely have been capable or affordable to manipulate the shots in every single scene. I do not believe that you can hold that against a film, however, unless there is no plot to go along with the mass of effects (i.e. War of the Worlds).<br/><br/>So it has come to this, though. Sin City certainly lives up to its name in telling a story with no real redeeming morality. Duh, it is called SIN city. For about half of the movie, I kept laughing at all of the violence because it was fairly comical. After the initial hour, though, I kept wondering if this is what our society has come to. Does it really require this much violence to keep us entertained? Even if it is not required, why do people keep asking for so much violence? I am not an advocate for any sort of censorship, but I am an advocate for personal responsibility for each individual. It is possible that I started thinking about this because the Clive Owen portion of the story wasn't really all that interesting to me.<br/><br/>Sin City was entertaining, but I didn't fell that it was as interesting as its comic counterpart, Dick Tracy. There is a much more modern feeling to SC than there is in DT, but I don't know if that is a good thing. I found the characters and art direction in DT more interesting, perhaps BECAUSE it didn't rely on special effects. I really don't understand why there is such a mismatch between the two in ratings. Sin City was good, but I wouldn't consider it a great film. It seems to me that a lot of people like this one because it makes them seem sophisticated. Its just one man's opinion."
"PersianPlaya408","10","1","2","27 August 2005"," Brilliantly awesome and entertaining
","Sin City is the best comic type of action film I have ever seen. The storyline draws you in, and the characters are very interesting, not to mention well-acted and the whole production is almost perfectly directed and written. Based on Miller's graphic novels(adult comic books), the film's style is perfect, Rodriguez and Tarantino's talents are clearly visible although CGI did a great job with the effects as well, and i think Tarantino's skill is more evident in the screenplay. The film tells several stories that are sort of connected and sort of not. Benicio Del Toro, Bruce Willis, Michael Madsen, Elijah Wood and Jaime King were great in their roles. Brittanny Murphy and Powers Boothe were decent although i didn't really like Rosario Dawson or Jessica Alba much in this flick. My two favorite performances came from Clive Owen and Mickey Rourke, both were great. I thought Michael Duncan Clarke and Nick Stahl were a bit wasted and Josh Hartnett was not good in his limited time on screen, but other than that this film is perfect, and a few mediocre performances by inexperiences young stars doesn't lower my perfect rating of it. 10/10 #43 on my list of all-time favorite films"
"s04-mborland","2","1","2","17 August 2005"," Roberto Rodriguez disappoints again
","After hearing the buzz made about Rodriguez' film 'Sin City' and seeing Tarantino's name on the film I decided to give the man one more chance to impress and once again I was extremely disappointed. Rodriguez stuck to his usual all style no substance approach but failed in even the style category. The stories in this film (there were three) were so shallow and contrived the it was impossible to take this film seriously. The dialogue was melodramatic and forced. Taking in this in to account I guess a case could be made that this is a comic book film meant to entertain. If that is the case it failed in that aspect as well. The characters and what occurs to them are such a farce that Batman and Spiderman seem like realists pictures. the only case to be made is that it is visually stunning, which I did not think it was. THe cast is the last thing that could save this movie, but ultimately some key miscasts (Brittany Murphy as the street tough New York waitress/hooker) cause it to be painful. I guess in some recess of the mind this could be considered a black comedy. If Robert Rodriguez' plan was to make a film so bad that the audience just had to laugh at it, then bravo. Otherwise, this film does not need to be mentioned in any respectable circles. I wish the director would stop incorporating Quentin Taratino's name in his garbage."

Fresh guts dangle from the bumpers and spark into the dark smoke of the broken exhaust. Bullets rip into the drunk, but it only makes him grip tighter to the wheel. As his eyes go dark, the car indiscriminately hits all the human scum stupid enough to stagger out and look. And the human scum keep firing bigger guns until the car fills up with blood and bursts into flame, only to sink into the foulest smelling tar pit just out of Sin City.<br/><br/>A visual feast and an emotional thrill, but just one one long car wreck, but the best one ever.

"rickmeister","9","1","2","16 August 2005"," Sinful Urban Comic-Strip Masterpiece
","To be honest I'm still reeling from seeing the first film for ages starring Mickey Rourke in which he hasn't sucked badly. Rourke is back, he's bad and he ain't beautiful. And in fact my other favourite Rourke film 'Rumblefish' shares some cinematographic similarities with Sin City, with it's black and white 'old movie' feel, vividly picked out with the occasional wash of primary colour.<br/><br/>However, Rourke's return to grace is a minor part of this film's triumph - the whole thing is utterly superb. From the script, to the dark, richly textured filming, to the excellent cameo performances from Clive Owen, Bruce Willis, Rutger Hauer, Michael Madsen and Benicio Del Toro. And that's not even mentioning the ladies. OK it's a comic book and it's a bit of a boy's fantasy, but hell Jessica Alba dancing in a cow-girl outfit is just something else - and there are similarly eye-catching performances from Rosario Dawson, Carla Gugino and Alexis Bledel. The plots intertwine between seemingly unconnected stories and present us with a cast of characters from the twisted and depraved to the noble and virtuous.<br/><br/>And in keeping with the original Frank Miller comic-book it's super violent. I also can't help feeling that with Tarantino's 'Guest Director' slot this is everything 'Kill Bill' should have been, rather than the poorly edited, half-finished, rambling jumble of emperor's new-clothes that I felt actually ended up in the cinemas.<br/><br/>There are certainly similarities with the ultra-violent Manga segment of 'Kill Bill' and the whole tone of the film with be-headings, torture and comic-book heroic feats are certainly ever-present as you would expect with a Rodriguez and Tarantino joint-venture.<br/><br/>They clearly got it just right in this picture and I really recommend seeing this in a movie-theatre where the beauty of the cinematography can be fully appreciated - the 2 hours or so will literally fly by as you immerse yourself in Frank Miller's dark urban fantasy."

","The visuals alone kept me glued to the screen.<br/><br/>Basin City is the bleakest place on earth, and although the city itself is black and white, the characters exhibit many shades of gray.<br/><br/>Make no mistake, this is a guy movie. As much as I enjoyed it, I couldn't escape that fact. But then again, it's a moving comic book, and who are the biggest readers of comic books? Yup, guys.<br/><br/>While watching it, I realised that of the female characters, those who weren't helpless victims, were whores (the whores represented the ""strong"" female characters in the film). And of the whores, one was a traitor! I couldn't help but feel that the writer didn't like women very much.<br/><br/>There were a lot of noir elements. Phillip Marlowe or Sam Spade wouldn't have looked out of place here. The film had a very 1940s look and feel. Police drove around in old cars, as did many characters, yet the characters looked essentially ""modern"".<br/><br/>If this film was done as a purely live action film, it probably would've been the goriest one of the year. They get around this by having the violence look ""cartooney"", and by having the blood run in odd colors.<br/><br/>Mickey Rourke was a knockout. For his performance, he earned every cent. He was a thug, maybe an ex-pug, a legbreaker, who knows? He was, in any case, an outcast, a fringe-dweller, who had a sweet side, and an incredible loyalty to a woman he'd only known for hours before her death.<br/><br/>Benicio Del Toro was excellent. He does great ""sleaze"". I didn't even realise it was him! One thing that bugged me, though, is that both he and Mickey Rourke seemed to speak in the same voice, which was a bit odd, especially as their 'bits' came one after the other.<br/><br/>Bruce Willis did a good job with his part, but he simply didn't appear to be old enough. Where were the makeup people with the latex stipple, who could've made him look over 60, as his character was meant to be? I found it laughable when, (unlike a ""real"" sixty-something unattached guy - or even the real Bruce Willis!), he kept rebuffing the advances of a hot, young blonde babe, who adored him.<br/><br/>In any case, this movie moved along pretty well, so that I was never bored. Perhaps it was the stunning visuals, with the occasional flashes of vivid color, that kept my attention.<br/><br/>Best viewed on the big screen, I think."

"missanthropy19","10","1","2","25 July 2005"," Dark, stylish, sexy and DAMNED entertaining
","Sin City is the delightful and devilish idea from the mind of imaginative Frank Miller. The remake of the comic is stylish film noir at its best. This sexy movie weaves three stories into one but each story has one thing in common: they're all in Basin City - a place infested with crooked cops, gangs and prostitutes. The first story is about Hartigan (Bruce Willis) - the rogue cop, one man absolutely determined to save a little girl from the hands of a sexual predator. The second is the story of Marv (Mickey Rourke), an apeish ex-con wishing to avenge the murder of his beloved Golde. Lastly, the gorgeous Dwight (Clive Owen) - a guy just wanting to look out for his barmaid girlfriend (Brittany Murphy) but ends up in a war between crooked cops and prostitutes, lead by Gail (Rosario Dawson).<br/><br/>The performances were outstanding. Mickey Rourke shone as Marv, and Benicio Del Toro plays a great Jackie Boy. Bruce Willis and Clive Owen both put in solid performances for their respective characters. I was surprised at Brittany Murphy's performance, which in my opinion was definitely her best. Rosario Dawson, Jessica Alba (Nancy) and Jaime King (Wendy/Golde) all put in sexy performances. The only disappointing performance was by Alexis Bledel (Becky) - I felt her a little flat and one dimensional, but this did not detract from the movie.<br/><br/>The best thing about this movie was the bold, stylish and VERY daring cinematography. It is shot in black and white, with splotches of colour every now and again (a red dress, blue eyes, etc.). I wouldn't be surprised if this movie got a few Oscars under its belt for this alone. The movie borders into fantasy, but never quite makes that step, which is a bold move by Rodriguez. The heroes do not wear capes, don't fly or have special powers, but there is something unnatural about them that is never explained.<br/><br/>The movie was an accurate representation of the comics, and I believe is a masterpiece of modern popular culture. Definitely *the* best comic book remake to date, and all in all, thoroughly entertaining. 4.5/5 stars."

","Clever. Very clever. Much of Frank Miller's original comic book feeling is here, but even more sophisticated.<br/><br/>The hardboiled lines are delivered in a hardboiled way, but the emotions are strong. The interesting thing is not the violent vigilante stories, but the stories about love. Love is complicated here. It goes far beyond what you find in comics; even in the ones of Frank Miller. You get interested in these people. Their vigilante actions might be regarded as completely primitive fantasies, but their love actions and shortcomings are from life.<br/><br/>Bruce Willis once again shows that he is a really talented actor. Usually he hides it well, but not here. See this, if you can stand lots and lots of yellow and sometimes even red blood. There is sun sometimes even in Sin City."
"willimen-geo","7","1","2","23 July 2005"," The atmosphere is dark, the violence raw and the women as deadly as well-curved!
","Sin City is one of the best efforts I have seen until now to transfer to the big screen a comic book. It totally respects the comic artist's (Frank Miller that is) perspective and makes a decent (and in a great part very successful) effort to transfer it to screen. A great deal of this achievement should be credited (in my opinion) to Frank Miller himself, since not only he co-directed the film with Rodriguez, but also in the first place his Sin City graphic novels are sketched in such a way as to oftentimes give the impression that you have in front of you a storyboard for a film. He has a very cinematographic way of sketching.<br/><br/>The aesthetics of the movie is fascinating and the way Rodriguez shot it (having the actors play most of the times in front of blue screens and then drawing the background scenery) in order to give it a more comic-like look has paid off and contributed dearly to the accurate transfer to the screen the biggest part of the comic's dark, claustrophobic and at times surreal atmosphere. I believe that Rodriguez, with Sin City, has set a new standard for the films that are comic book transfers (as was his intention in the first place).<br/><br/>A special credit should be given to Mickey Rourke's acting which is excellent. Rourke completely and inspiringly brings to life one of the most touching characters of Sin City (Marv) exactly as presented in the comic. One of his best performances of late.<br/><br/>The movie's violence may disturb some, but nobody said that Sin City is a movie for housewives. A rather hilarious remark about the film I heard was while waiting in the line outside the cinema when I went to see it. It came from a middle-aged woman, coming out of the cinema some minutes before the end (god I hate those people) and ""warning"" us: ""Go grab a straw while you are at it, to suck all the blood"". It is true that the movie is not kind with its audience, but that is the least to be expected when Rodriguez and Miller co-direct and Tarantino special-guest-directs.<br/><br/>In the bottom line I thoroughly enjoyed Sin City. Not so much as reading the graphic novels though, but I believe that many will find it even more exciting. Rodriguez's and Miller's inspired direction provides a compelling, dark atmosphere. The great cast gives very good performances (with best of all in my opinion Rourke's) and on top of it all is the scenario with as original stories as any, in our times, can be.<br/><br/>A flick definitely worth seeing at least once."
"romaj002","7","1","2","22 July 2005"," An interesting piece of trash cinema
","The film could be argued to be involved in a conversation concerning the ""best worst movies ever made"", as it is successful in creating the certain mood necessary for trash cinema. This noir piece of pulp fiction is filled with the necessary violence and vulgarity to fully envelope the audience so that the film's flabbergasting luridness has them feeling the fun and humour in it, whilst still quezzing uneasily about how this viewing is going to effect them in the future. <br/><br/>Genetiles seem to always take centre stage in trash cinema and there is no exception here with the film seemingly revolving around the destroying of genitalia and its attempt to recreate it. I would suggest that Bruce Willis' final barrage of destruction upon his enemy's gentiles will be one of the most remembered scenes of all underground cinema. The cinematography does at times drift from the trash cinema realm to appease a more mainstream audience. The camera work and subsequent shots of Bruce Willis in solitary are definitely a highlight of the film, evoking reminiscence of Scorsese's direction in 'Raging Bull'.<br/><br/>Mainstream audiences will struggle to understand the purpose and poise of the film unless they are prepared for the viewing. However, it is still unlikely that they will be able to fully appreciate what the film was created for and what it represents. <br/><br/>The film is well worth the time, satisfying those looking for cheap thrills sustained from lurid, unnerving violence and those who wish to critic the film's place among the great pieces of trash cinema."

Only jack talks in this town. The goateed guy behind the window doesn't even look at me. Just at my sawbuck. Guess he'd rather be at a comic book store.<br/><br/>The floor's so sticky that I have pry up my Doctor Dentons with my shiv just to take a step. The first seat I try folds like a bad poker hand, and I barely keep my keister out of a pile of melted goo on the floor. The place stinks. I haven't smelled this much coconut oil since I passed out on Virginia Beach after a three-day Sterno binge. Seems like the right place to see Sin City.<br/><br/>Yeah. Sin City. If a movie had a smell, this one would reek of cigarettes, cheap hooch, and even cheaper sex. Looks like the kind of town where the main cause of death is lead poisoning contracted during a smoke in a filthy toilet stall.<br/><br/>But, at the get go, it's all about love. Boy meets girl. Boy kisses girl. Boy whacks girl with his big 44 mag. Love sure makes people do funny things. <br/><br/>Bruce Willis shows up as Hartigan, the only honest cop in Sin City. Smart move when your acting career is in the tank. Go back to the old Pulp Fiction well. Too bad he has a bum ticker. He shoots the equipment off some creep who's favorite song is ""Thank Heaven for Little Girls."" He saves a little girl, but the creep has low friends in high places. <br/><br/>Mickey Rourke shows up next as Marv, a big gorilla who looks like the Frankenstein monster after he's finished a hitch in the Marines. A beautiful hooker named Goldie gives him a night of sweaty bliss. Too bad she wakes up dead in the morning. Poor dope. Looks like he's being framed. What did he expect in Sin City? Marv ""kills his way to the top"" to find out who's framing him. But he didn't figure on getting his butt kicked by Frodo Baggins. Yep, Elijah Wood with the kung-fu grip takes big Marv down. It's like watching the Lollipop Guild wail on Sergeant Rock. But Marv don't stay down long.<br/><br/>The next story is another heart warmera killer, a bad cop, some Irish mercs, and an army of hookers. You'd swear this was a Disney flick--maybe ""Herbie Goes to the Tenderloin"" or ""Pollyanna's Big Score."" Clive Owen is Dwight, a ""killer with a new face"" who's after Benicio del Toro, a bad cop whose been slapping around Dwight's new girl. Dwight chases the flatfoot into Old Town, which is the territory of the Fighting Hookers of the 101st Prophylactic. Seems that the hookers have a deal with the cops and the mob that gives them Old Town. Seems that they didn't know del Toro was a cop. Seems that this kung-fu hooker killed the copper by plugging his gat so it backfires (never let this happen to you). Seems this breaks the truce and gives the mob a chance to retake Old Town. Seems it's up to Dwight and his old hooker girlfriend (Rosario Dawson) to keep this from happening. Seems like nothing is ever like it seems.<br/><br/>Remember Hartigan? Well, he's been framed, too, by the creep's old man, who happens to be a senator (Powers Booth). Tough break. Hartigan gets out of the joint after eight years, but he's a tool for finding the little girl he saved at the beginning. She's found a fulfilling career as dancer with a rope act at this dive where Marv hangs out. I never meet classy broads like that. Anyway, Hartigan has to save her from this yellow-skinned creep who who looks like he was on the losing side of the War of the Rings. No prizes for guessing who he is. Seems that the creep's old man found some drugs that grew back what Hartigan shot off, but with some nasty side effects. Never use that stuff they hawk on the Internet.<br/><br/>But remember, all this is in the name of love. Sweaty, grimy, blood-soaked l-o-v-e.<br/><br/>I shambled out of the theater, my feet crunching on half-eaten Lemonheads and sticking to stinking puddles of Cherry Coke syrup. So, what about this Sin City? Definitely looks cool, but I doubt that Suzie Sunshine and Larry Lawnmower in Suburbia are gonna take to it. Not too multiplex friendly, this flick. But I bet they sneak it out of video stores in plain brown wrappers."

","Sin City makes Cinema Noir look positively white. The four stars awarded are for the excellent visual treatment, very original and stylish, that would make even Orson Welles applaud, bringing a comic strip (albeit a R rated one) to life on the screen at last. Not since Tim Burton's Gotham City, has there been such a menacing metropolis. The black and white images highlighting some elements in colour are truly imaginative and in themselves work extremely well. However the script is mainly sadistic nonsense, and it seems a pity that such clever photography is squandered on a plethora of sex, violence, torture, and gruesome killings. Bruce Willis, Clive Owen and the return of Mickey O'Rouke (looking like a mini version of the Hulk) set out to revenge themselves on very unpleasant characters, but in an avalanche of bloodletting ghoulish torture and killings, suggesting that murder is some sort of competitive sport - violence for violence sake. These especially grisly murders, the torture and exploitation of women, is not everyone's idea of entertainment. Including the Nosferatu lookalike dispatched in a burst of maniacal violence by Willis. It may be faithful to the source material, which fortunately I haven't read, but in a world threatened by terrorists every day, wherein people may be blown up by lunatic bombers this blood and guts ode to violent death and torture is not especially appropriate."

I seriously was counting the days to see it, I couldn't stop talking about it. Watching it's awesome trailers (the best cut trailers I've seen), re-viewing posts on this site and critics, everything seemed to be nothing but positive. Then I finally saw it... When the first shot appeared on the screen with that woman in the red dress with the city's dank black and white surroundings, it took my breath away. THEN, I found myself saying ""Why am I not liking this""????. ""Am I missing something""?. There's no deny the skill and talent that was displayed on screen, it's brutal and beautiful, shot to perfection, the best use of green screen/film, probably ever. But why wasn't I enjoying it? I felt bored, everything seemed repetitive, some scenes were better than others, but it didn't seem to go anywhere, I was so upset. And to see that so many of my fellow film buffs like this film, I'm kinda wondering where I went wrong.

It wouldn't matter if the three linked up in any meaningful way, but they don't. As far as I can see, the principal male stars are all in the lap dancing club at one point. And that's it. The sad fact is that only one of the three stories is good, which is that of Marv (Rourke). This story is utterly fantastic, well shot, well told, and well paced, although the moralistics of the tale don't really stand up to much scrutiny. Certain sections of the dialogue is utterly contemptible, but for some reason they don't jar so much when the hero is so utterly likable as Marv. From the very beginning, although Marv does some pretty heinous things, we empathise and like his character far more than the other two male leads in 'Sin City', despite the fact (or probably because of the fact) that he's a monster. For some reason the utterly over the top violence that Marv commits seem to be an inescapable aspect of his character, part of his feral, barely controlled personality. This is not an excuse to explain away the excessive violence in the film, but it seems to fit in with the dynamics of this story far more than it does in the other two, where it just seems inserted for the sake of it. Marv is certainly the character with the most depth in the film, built up as he is of contrasts and contradictions. This aids the telling of this part of the story immensely.<br/><br/>I'm not going to devote much space to discussing the other two strands, because they genuinely aren't really worth devoting much attention to. Rourke is a much better gravel and whisky voiced narrator than the other two, who really do just sound a little bit pussy, like little boys trying to talk like men. Willis' story is slightly better than the utterly puerile, misogynistic and poorly paced / plotted other story, which I would guess is justified as empowering to women, which is another way of saying we put them in sexy outfits and let them kill lots of stupid men. Because we 'respect' them ( *hollow laughter* ), this justifies us portraying them as sex objects. And the speeches where Dwight continually refers to Gina as his Valkyrie are so completely and totally corny and pathetic that it is actually insulting to the intelligence of the viewer. Furthermore, the Irish characters in this story are just feel like last minute insertions, hollowly characterised and stereotypical bad guys to put in there because all the other ones are dead and they needed to stretch the story out for another fifteen minutes by providing cannon fodder for our intrepid hero.<br/><br/>I'm not familiar with Miller's work and as such am spared having to compare the film version to the comic, which seems to be a bone of contention with many people on here. For what it's worth though, I thought that the film looked utterly fantastic for the most part, although occasionally the darkness of the surroundings was an impediment. Stylistically, I also really liked the flashes of color, although they were usually on things totally unrelated to plot development, what there was of it.<br/><br/>Sin City, on the whole is a classic example of testosterone fuelled style over substance, which relies far too much on conventions handed down from films like Pulp-Fiction to have much merit in it's own right. However, for me the film is redeemed by a top notch performance from Rourke, and it's awesome visuals. Not bad, could have been better."
"Jadewidow","9","1","2","14 July 2005"," Excellent adult viewing
","The actors were superb in this movie, reminding me of gritty film noir flicks without the soap opera like acting of those olden days. Any fan of old detective classics such as PI Marlow himself will be impressed. Any fan of comic book artwork will absolutely adore this movie. Certainly, the language and violence are not meant for kids. However, such things are at least not gratuitous. The use of black and white vs. the rare dramatic use of color throughout the movie was exceptionally well done. Don't listen to anyone trying to compare this movie to 'Pulp Fiction' either, though that was certainly an interesting film as well. 'Sin City' is completely unique and the feel of it is something that really can't be grouped with other movies. Rutger Hauer provided a performance even better than what he delivered in 'Blade Runner'."
"LennyRenquist","10","1","2","14 July 2005"," Makes Tank Girl look like a bad film.
","Comic books (or graphic novels, or whatever you want to call them) don't particularly interest me. Never have. It's not that I necessarily dislike them, I've just never felt the urge to shell out money for them. I'd much rather watch movies. Strangely though, I seem to really love movies BASED on comic books. Particularly the recent ones. Spider-Man 1 & 2. X-Men 1 & 2. Batman Begins. Hulk. I even like that rubbish Tank Girl movie, mostly because of Ice-T's brilliant turn as an ex-cop-turned-kangaroo-mutant. It is the absolute BEST portrayal of an ex-cop-turned-kangaroo-mutant you will EVER see on film. Lori Petty wasn't bad, either.<br/><br/>But none of them come close to matching Sin City for sheer movie badness (meant in a positive way, like the way the hip kids say it. Actually, 'sickness' is probably a more appropriate term). This is a grand day in the history of film-making. It is without a doubt the BEST movie Mickey Rourke has EVER been in. And Brittany Murphy, for that matter. It's really, REALLY good. Just don't let the kids see it, and don't watch it with your Mum. Trust me, I speak from experience. My Mum likes NICE movies. And this one's anything but.<br/><br/>As implied above, I had no prior knowledge of Frank Miller's books. I'm sure they're great, and, from what I've heard, the movie's style is very true to them. But, with respect, that means little to me. I'm just looking at Sin City as a movie. And a damn fine one it is.<br/><br/>First of all, the visual style of the film is breathtaking. But there's been enough said about that already, and I can't really add anything new, except that I dug Dwight's red shoes. Yay red shoes!<br/><br/>The dialogue is brilliantly corny. It's original, but phrased in that old-fashioned, clichéd, b-grade film-noir way. And it sounds great, particularly when coming from the mouths of such talented actors. Even the above-mentioned Mr. Rourke and Ms. Murphy - who I usually wouldn't touch with the narrow end of a broom while wearing a radiation suit - are superb in their roles. In fact, Marv is the best character in the film, and Rourke's portrayal stands out above the stellar ensemble surrounding him. The other two 'leading men' - Clive Owen's Dwight and Bruce Willis's Hartigan - are also very good, but lack Marv's beautiful, brutal simplicity. Plus their chins are nowhere near as big, and their coats nowhere near as fine-lookin'.<br/><br/>I was impressed by EVERYONE's performance, even those from actors who no longer impress me, due to the fact that they always impress me (Don't worry, I know what I mean). I'm not going to go into WHY everyone was so good, as there were so many actors who were so good in so many different ways. From A-for-Alba to Z-for- um - Wood, I loved 'em all.<br/><br/>Elijah Wood as the CREEPIEST villain in recent movie history? Didn't see THAT coming! <br/><br/>And was that REALLY Carla Gugino? I'll never look at Spy Kids the same way again, that's for DAMN sure! Zoinks! <br/><br/>Robert Rodriguez, you film-making pioneer, you. You DEADSET LEGEND you! I used to think Once Upon a Time in Mexico was your masterpiece. How incredibly silly I now feel.<br/><br/>What more can I say? Nothing really, except...<br/><br/>...give me sequel! NOW!"

","Sin City is a comic book movie with a difference. Based on the graphic novels by Frank Miller, this is a contemporary noir that follows the original stories exactly. Shot in black and white with splashes of colour and a Pulp Fiction-like narrative structure, Sin City is a genre all on its own and looks set to be one of the biggest films of the year. This film is not for those with weak stomachs as most of the women of Basin City meet a rather grisly end. Feminists may also choose to steer clear as the only women in Sin City tend to be either strippers, prostitutes or lesbians. That said, this is not a bloke's film (and especially not one for a first date). Being a fan of Rom-coms, I don't usually go for blood and guts films but Sin City is not like that. It is the best film I have seen at the cinema for a long time. The entire look of the film is just amazing with great cinematography and editing and a good guest director appearance from Quentin Tarantino. Sin City had me hooked from the very start with its in-depth characters and action-packed stories. I can't wait to see what Rodriguez and Miller do next."

Rodriguez's vision was incredible. He did a superb job in translating Frank Miller's work. I especially loved the way he used red within the black and white photography. The effect was bold and dark simultaneously. It was such a good movie that I didn't even want to take a bathroom break.

The movie gets boring after an hour of watching despite good actors and ""dramatic"" storyline, and my opinion is that everything valuable is in the fact that you really get blown away by just watching the movie, and not really thinking about it.

Performances are excellent, photography is unique, the atmosphere dark and compelling. A breath of fresh air from Hollywood and a proof that there is plenty of talent that can work little miracles.

","I saw this with some mates a few nights back and we were all completely blown away by this film. the over the top comic book style that only this film could get away with without been slated and ground into the dirt, Some of the one liners (althought funny moments are rare the ones that are there are good) The general feel of the film is hard to describe but it works brilliantly the occasional splash of colour adds so much and draws attention to characters eyes or emphasizes certain points which you then have to take notice of. one example is Kevin. ordinarily his look would be nothing special but with the black and white the way his glasses stand out in the darkness is superbly done. Only a couple of downsides. the three interlocking stories can sometimes be hard to follow if you need to go to the john and miss a bit as they shift time periods similar to pulp fiction.<br/><br/>Over all this is one piece of cinema that simply cannot be missed just go in with an open mind and you will leave amazed"
"Ricky_Roma__","Null","1","2","16 June 2005"," Good fun, but nothing more
","Ever since I saw the trailer I've been looking forward to seeing Sin City. The visual style and the potential for a tough, gritty film hooked me. But one thing nagged at me. I've never seen a Robert Rodriguez film I've liked. Sure I've only seen 'Desperado' and 'From Dusk Till Dawn', but they were enough to put me off him. He's truly the king of style over substance. Both of those films are so thin that they snap if you try and take a close look at them. Plus the action in both is incredibly tedious and repetitive.<br/><br/>So how does Sin City fare? Did it make me think any differently about Rodriguez? No, not really. He's still a director uncomfortable with narrative. However, Sin City is stylish. Very much so. And it's also violent, nasty and pretty good fun to boot. It's just a shame that the fantastic images are cobbled together by some lousy storytelling.<br/><br/>The worst offender is the first big story - the Marv story. It moves at such a pace and lumbers forward so incoherently that I was really fearing for the film. Characters were given about five seconds set-up and then they were usually dispatched. And the scenes just rattled by. You're never given any time to adjust to the world. You're never given any time to get to know the character. It's relentless. And while the premise itself is rather good, the execution is poor. Basically Marv falls in love after five seconds, the woman gets killed after ten and after thirty seconds Marv is on a rampage to avenge her death. It's all rather silly. But instead of laughing with the film, I was laughing at it. Surely the film had to get better...<br/><br/>Thankfully, it did. The second big story, while again rather flawed, was an improvement on the first. It flowed better, it actually had a set-up and it had some good gallows humour. However, it was perhaps the most adolescent story - although to be fair the whole film is aimed at horny teenagers. Just the whole idea of a bunch of gun-welding prostitutes with great bodies and amazing killing skills makes me laugh. It's very much a male fantasy, as is the idea that women get a kick out of being hit. To be honest, the violence in the film didn't bother me one iota, but the film just has a pubescent feeling to it. Everything is pitched at horny boys.<br/><br/>The final big story I thought was the best. It was the only one that had me gripped from beginning to end. But having said this, the story is far from original. It could be from any cheap paperback novel. But unlike the other stories it does almost succeed in engaging me on something more than just a visceral level. As familiar as the territory is, there was something quite touching about the man in solitary confinement, waiting for a child's letter as he does time for a crime he didn't commit. And I loved the moment when Jessica Alba jumps from the stage to hug Willis. It has real feeling. And their awkward romance, while done a million times before, was well done too. Therefore, the revenge story that followed I found very satisfying.<br/><br/>So although my feelings are mixed, I ended up enjoying the film. It may add up to nothing and it may get off to a bad start, but in the end it turns out to be bloody good fun."
"Corky1984","Null","1","2","13 June 2005"," Not your usual Hollywood fare
","I'm in two minds about Sin City. Parts of it were quite entertaining, yet there were moments when I felt that the whole thing had become more than a little over-pretentious. Overall though, this is not a bad film, but is certainly an acquired taste. It will appeal to comic book fans, but not being one myself I can't be sure what makes 'em tick! Anyway, the film is essentially a series of segments in which we follow one of the leading characters for say 20 or 30 minutes as they meander around Sin City. There's a good deal of violence, generally cleverly done, but action fans be warned, this gets a bit artsy at times. The way this is filmed evokes the film noir spirit, with splashes of colour thrown in to emphasise key themes et al. Sin City is certainly stylish. However, the drawback of following one leading character for so long is that when you chance upon one you dislike you're stick with them for too long. Bruce Willis was on fine form, but Clive Owen hardly sets the world alight with his performance. Mickey Rourke was strange, but does that make his scenes good? It's all down to your own film tastes I suppose. Red blooded male viewers will be pleased to see a dazzling array of scantily clad ladies throughout the film, a bonus when some of the dialogue gets a tad dull in particular. Elijah Wood makes an odd appearance and dies a rather inventive death in one of the film's highlights. Basically, Sin City has enough good moments to entertain, but in the middle I began to wish it would finish soon. Luckily it rallies somewhat towards the end, thanks especially to a good turn from Willis. Sin City won't appeal to everyone, but its worth a look."
"MartinK75","6","1","2","13 June 2005"," Visually striking but hollow
","Sin City is an experimental film seeking to bridge the gap between live action and and animation. Its main calling card is its look which it does deliver on. Shot in moody, retro black and white with occasional splashes of colour, the movie is a feast for the eyes which is just as well as there's not really much else going on. In terms of plot, characterisation and having something to say about the human condition, Sin City doesn't even make it out of the starting blocks, though it's obvious that these concerns weren't high on the filmmakers' list of priorities in the first place. The various plots are just perfunctory pastiches of vigilante/noir movies of old which service the film's visuals rather than the other way around. The actors blend into their surroundings well enough but it's hard for any of them to really shine as the characters they're playing are essentially cardboard cut-outs. The film is pretty violent and not for the squeamish but much of the violence is really of the Tom & Jerry cartoon variety with characters receiving blows which in real life would concuss or even kill them but which here merely leave them dazed for a couple of seconds. Overall, Sin City is a perfectly watchable film but is around 10/15 minutes too long and its unwillingness to engage the audience on any kind of emotional level ultimately lessens its potential impact considerably."
"stamper","8","1","2","12 June 2005"," The inevitable return of Robert?
","I must confess that I wasn't too sure about this movie. I mean Robert Rodriguez used to be great. Heck that guy was on my TOP 5 favorite director list back in 1996 after I'd seen his films and let me tell you they were all great. From El Mariachi and Roadracers to Desperado and From Dusk 'till Dawn. Bu then came the slow demise of Robert Rodriguez...The Faculty was only OK in a teenage horror kind of way...Spy Kids sucked so bad, I didn't even bother with 2 and 3D...and finally he messed up with the Mariachi's in Once upon a Time in Mexico. That guy was scraped off the list, almost as fast as he'd gotten on there. But then there came rumors about a graphic comic book adaption and I got really psyched...I started hoping where I'd lost hope and I must say that when I saw the trailer I was as scared as I was relieved. I mean it certainly looked as if the 'good old' Rodriguez was back, but in a way I was scared. The trailer looked a lot like 'style over matter' to me and I was not sure he'd pull it off. For him to do that he'd really had to get that comic feeling in to it...<br/><br/>Well he did. As soon as the film started I got sucked into Sin City and wasn't allowed out until the ending credits rolled. Sin City is really exciting stuff. Although there isn't much of a background to the characters you care for them and feel with them, which actually is kind of an accomplishment since they are mainly bad guys...the thing about it is though, there are worse guys. No matter how depraved and bad the heroes in this picture are, they all have a heart somewhere and despite all of their sins they are still human. This is particularly evident with Marv (Mickey Rourke), who is very mean and brutal and yet you somewhat condone what he is doing. In a way this film makes you an inhabitant of Sin City. Your values fade, your rules are bent and you come to accept that everything that happens on screen happens by the rules. That is what great film-making is all about.<br/><br/>Rodriguez couldn't have pulled it off without a great cast though and I must say that everyone fit the picture here. I was especially taken by Marv (Mickey Rourke) and Jackie Boy (Benicio Del Toro). As far as the ladies go, I must say that there while they were much more shallow than most of their male counterparts I sort of had a soft spot for Nancy (Jessica Alba). My least favorite character was Shellie (Britanny Murphy), whom I really couldn't connect with at all. I just felt that she was odd. The rest of the characters and actors ranged from adequate to the above mentioned 'greats'.<br/><br/>The visuals were another certain plus to the film, as it helped you in getting into the comic surreal feeling of the film and accepting everything that happened there. I'm not talking about the rules of the street here, but about the more unconventional stuff, such as the the Yellow Bastard, the sheer invincibility of some of the main characters and the comic brutality depicted in this film. The film just had that comic book character that made believe everything you see. It was almost as if I was flipping through an old Batman comic. It was just great...and so original. Hats off to Rodriguez and to Miller of course who had his share in the directing (and the writing of course). On account of this I say: ROBERT = BACK. Too bad about The adventures of Shark Boy and Lava girl in 3D though. Well I guess I can live with him doing that, as long as he keeps popping films like these out every now and then (9 years is way too long though).<br/><br/>8,5 out of 10 (with an 8 given upon voting)"

","OK, frankly speaking, I am not sorry I have watched this one. But had I known in advance how it was going to be, I would very likely rather not see it. The flick is action packed & draws attention, but it is a one more evidence, that Rodriguez had long ago gone out of style. His early movies were violent, but, in the same time, ironic & smart. Not only Sin City has got no meaning, while being rather pretentious, it is extremely overloaded with, at times, absolutely unnecessary violence, nudity & cursing. The main strength &, in the same time, the greatest weakness of the film, is that the atmosphere of Sin City is depicted as straightforward & natural as possible. While it is a great achievement to make a film so dark & gloomy with absolutely no positive characters, it is in the same time a major disadvantage. Since all the characters of Sin City are complete scum, I haven't feel compassion to any of them, which made me kind of indifferent to the story. As I have already said, the movie is overloaded with brutality, & thus it is a little hard to perceive. The acting is not that good either or it is just unnoticed, since the characters are undeveloped. I think the best job, in terms of acting, was done by Benicio Del Torro. Others' acting works will be easily forgotten. To conclude, Sin City is a pretentious, over-hyped, overloaded with violence & nudity technically amazingly well done movie, but with too little humor, absolutely no meaning & no soul."

","'Sin City' is a film that cries for an 'NC-17' rating. Though somewhat familiar with the work of Frank Milller, I was unprepared for the level of violence and gore in this film. Although I recognized the talent displayed in film-making, editing, art direction, and CGI, I could not get beyond the nature of the content of this film. It overwhelms everything. Despite the film's techniques that are used to mute the film's stylistic mayhem, the horrific images displayed, the grim depressive atmosphere, and the lack of sympathetic characters, overwhelm all else. Perhaps, as one commentator suggested, this film is best viewed as a DVD release where you can examine the imagery in short segments."
"turbo_torben","9","1","2","14 May 2005"," Brutal noir
","I've never actually read the comic book by Frank Miller (although i'm a big fan of his Bat Man comic). I've only studied the wonderful use of black/white aesthetic. That was the first thing that struck me after watching 5 minutes of Sin City: The aesthetic of this movie is absolutely stunning, stunning, stunning! Using the tradition of German expressionism and Film Noir, and combining it with CGI, the team has created an fantastic dark and gloomy world, which is hard to compare with anything seen on the screen. Every second I was watching and enjoying the war between light and shadows, which created a great tension. But what about the narrative and the plot? Sure it looks great, but does the story live up to it? Sin City tells a very alternative story of morality, obsession and most of all murder. It feels very fragmented, and it's hard to keep track of the story. But is it bad? No! This is the kind of movie which rethinks the way in which narrative is told. The dialog and the bits and pieces of story seems more important than the overall plot. It's new. It's weird. It's very un- mainstream. But at the end it works great. The wide mainstream audience are likely to leave the cinema during this movie (if not because of the weird storytelling, then at least because of the extreme violence). However Sin City is a shocking fresh breath. This is the kind of movie which really push the barriers. Some people will love. Others will love to hate it."

","Straight from the pages of the Frank Miller graphic novels comes Robert Rodriguez's best film to date, and possibly one of the greatest film events ever seen! Weaving three tales together (three and a bit if you include the opening segment), this is a throwback to classic film noir, but brought bang up to date with some of the most striking visuals of recent years. I had hopes for this film, but some worries. Being a fan of the comic book, could the film actually live up to the style of Miller's creations? The answer is a resounding ""Yes!"" as all the frames and characters come to buoyant life. The film doesn't just do the comic justice, it actually becomes the comic, and by doing so surpasses it, as we get to see the once 2D characters live on screen for us! A bit of background for those not in the know. Sin City was a series of short stories, and long tales, set in a fictional town called Basin City. Through it we were introduced to a variety of characters, none of them truly good (except, perhaps, Hartigan  played by Willis in the film), and plenty bad. From Marv, the disfigured ex-con who seeks the killer of a woman he loved, to Roark Jr, aka That Yellow Bastard (played by Stahl), their tales were interwoven, but never interfered with each other. The graphic novels were skillfully drawn in black and white, with the occasional hint of color (a red dress here, yellow skin there), paying homage to the old noir style which inspired them. The tales were the stuff of pulp novella, and the imagery striking. The film takes 3 of the tales and weaves them together, recreating the pages from the comic, and giving a film which many have compared to Pulp Fiction due to the disjointed-time story telling. However, that is an unfair comparison, Pulp Fiction was not this good! Robert Rodriguez has always delivered strong films on a low budget, from El Mariachi and Depserado (the latter cost $8million), to Faculty and Spy Kids. With Sin City he has taken $30million and made a film that looks like it cost $200million!! Frank Miller, the creator of the comics, joined him on set to direct  Rodriguez didn't want to adapt the storyhe wanted the film to BE the comic! Miller was reluctant to join  in the past his work has been trashed on screen, with his Robocop 2 script ending up a pale shadow of the original idea by the time it was filmed. Rodriguez managed to convince him that this would be different by bringing him in to witness a 'screentest'. That 'screentest' is the opening segment (featuring Josh Hartnett), and it blew Miller away! It wasn't only the reproduction of a short tale he wrote, it was visually perfect! In order to create the unique look the film has  that being a comic book on screen  Rodriguez turned to the technologies that helped him craft Spy Kids, and used a lot of green-screen. Much like how Sky Captain was made, with the cast being the only real things on display and all else being added later, Sin City was given the look by computers. You wouldn't tell really! The cars are all CGI, the chair, tables, bottles, toiletsall CGI, yet look more real than anything else! Visually the film is a masterpiece, the black and white working well to set the mood. The occasional flash of color ignites the screen, and highlights the focus at the time. The flips to negative are right out of the comic, the silhouetting of characters, and the unique coloration of the blood, all add to the wonderful style.<br/><br/>The film could have been all looks and no heart, but the performances on offer from some of the industry's greatest names lend more than character to the players. Bruce Willis, after a few years of stagnant roles, returns to splendid form, much in the way he did in Pulp Fiction. Mickey Roarke, behind the prosthetics, manages to get you caring for Marv, who, at heart, is a bit of a nutjob! Jessica Alba is delightfully delicious as Nancy, Del Toro is strangely understandable as Jackie Boythe list goes on and on! No one actor dominates the film, with everyone lending equal might to their roles. Stahl's evil Yellow Bastard is perfect, and as for Elijah Wood's role as the murderous nut, Kevin, all I can say iswow! No egos come out for the whole film, no one star tries to be the focus of the film. All of the cast seem to know that there is only one star here, Frank Miller! With such strong performances, outstanding cinematic beauty, and well woven story-telling aspects, it only needs a great soundtrack to make this film complete, and here is where Rodriguez shows his genius is complete, by scoring a fantastically atmospheric 'noir' kind of soundtrack! Inspired by the kind of music you hear in old Bogart movies, this is typical gangster/detective tunes, but given that Sin City feel.<br/><br/>For fans of the comic book, I cannot recommend this film to you enough. You will laugh, cry, and be in awe at your anti-heroes coming to life. For those without a clue as to the comic's existence, don't feel you will be alienated. No, this film can reach out to you all as it relies on one simple thinggreat stories! Who doesn't like them?"
"froggstarr","10","1","2","1 May 2005"," Sin City - Anything but Sinful
","Firstly let me start by saying I am no massive fan of comic book movies. I like comic books but after seeing X-men and then Spiderman adapted for the big screen, well I actually felt sick to my stomach. So when I settled down to watch Sin City I did so expecting another bout of pathetic acting and cornball lines that did no justice to the graphic novel. 20 minutes in and its safe to say my expectations were shot down like a paper aeroplane in a gun range. What a film, gripping, dark and most importantly superbly cast and so true to the graphic novel. Shot mainly in black and white (although when watching the characters masterful performances it will seem like it is in colour) and using a pulp fiction style story this is not only the best comic book movie I have ever seen it ranks as one of the best movies I have ever seen and will leave you begging for more of Sin City's dark and brilliant stories."
"gortx","Null","1","2","27 April 2005"," Cold overlong tech exercise a la SKY CAPTAIN
","Like SKY CAPTAIN AND THE WORLD OF TOMORROW, SIN CITY thrusts us into the brave new world of film-making done completely in the computer with human beings plopped into the digital world like living ""props"". And, like SKY CAPTAIN (and going back to the computer scenes in 1982's TRON), we have a technical exercise that is deficient in the plot and story departments.<br/><br/>No doubt, SIN CITY is a visual marvel. Working closely with the original graphic novelist, FRANK MILLER, director ROBERT RODRIGUEZ continues his development as a virtual one man studio. Having been somebody who attended one of the first Hollywood screenings of EL MARIACHI (with Rodriguez in attendance) it is both remarkable and disappointing to see how far Rodriguez has gone while not developing into a more mature storyteller. For, SIN CITY, is little more than another tale (actually three) of a desperado on the fringes of the law who has some action scenes as he meets ""hot chicks"" along the way. Sadly, there is more heart, character development and ""plot"" in EL MARIACHI as there is the triple anthology.<br/><br/>As to the fanboys who are jumping up and down in excitement over how well Frank Miller's artwork has been brought to the screen, the simple truth is that comic books and graphic novels are one art form and movies are another. It is in the same way that stagy filmed Broadway plays are dull as cinema. The best comic books to film transfers are imagined as movies first (SUPERMAN, SPIDERMAN II). In SIN CITY, there are times when the actors stop, pose, and deliver their lines in clipped, curt spurts - you can almost see the ""thought balloon"" dancing above their heads as if to limit how long the speech can be. It'll be great for those who love to watch the DVD's over and over, stop framing and slow-motioning their favorite passages, but in a movie theater, it's strains an already overlong film into tedium. I've never quite understood the need for some to watch the same DVD's multiple times. No matter how much you may love a film, it is far more rewarding to use at least some of that time to seek out new and varied films that you have NOT seen. <br/><br/>Looking at the history of Hollywood, it is no surprise that the earliest films that break new technical ground {whether it is SOUND (1926's FOOTLIGHTS OF NEW YORK), COLOR (allegedly 1918's CUPID ANGLING), CINEMASCOPE (THE ROBE) or 3-D (BWANA DEVIL)} have rarely, if ever, been artistic as well as scientific breakthroughs. Both SIN CITY and SKY CAPTAIN will hopefully lead to more innovative uses of that style of film-making."
"dragonscrew714","9","1","2","26 April 2005"," wow!
","Ask any true comic book fanatic what the ""Sin City"" graphic novel series represents and they'll say it's without a doubt one of the most under-appreciated and thought provoking graphic novels ever. Written by Frank Miller, ""Sin City"" never strays too far away from its comic book roots and takes full advantage of the great story it was based on. Never before has any comic-inspired movie stayed this close to the work it was based on.<br/><br/>Frank Miller, the writer and artist of ""Sin City"" graphic novels, who also directs this film alongside Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino, is a true pioneer of the comic business with over 30 years of accolades. Miller is probably best known for single handedly bringing the Daredevil, Spiderman, and Batman comics back from near cancellations with his dark and explosive style; all at different points in his career. Those still unfamiliar with Miller's work should also know that he created the heroine Electra, which a hit movie was loosely based on not too long ago starring Jennifer Garner.<br/><br/>The film adaptation of the graphic novel series ""Sin City"" screams Quentin Tarantino from the get-go, as fans of the ""Pulp Fiction"", ""Reservoir Dogs"", and ""Kill Bill"" movies will feel right at home with the ""story within a story"" telling and the frequent amount of irony and amazing fight scenes that ""Sin City"" have been sprinkled throughout. Be warned though, some scenes are not for the squeamish and are full of blood and mature themes that some may find politically incorrect and overly edgy. That being considered, ""Sin City"" accomplishes everything it sets out to do and then some by recreating the very same environment that made the graphic novel series a cult-classic on the big screen.<br/><br/>Aside from the amount of great action scenes throughout ""Sin City"", the best reason to go see this movie is the myriad of visual effects through the movie. The movie plays games with your eyes in ways never thought possible before, as it was filmed in a semi- black and white state with vibrant colors sneaking their way in throughout the picture. Certain moments you'll be sure you're watching a black and white movie, while at others you'll think the directors dropped the film reel in a bucket full of ""Skittles"".<br/><br/>""Sin City"" features an all-star cast, with the likes of Bruce Willis, Jessica Alba, Clive Owen, Rosario Dawson, Benicio Del Toro, Devon Aoki, Mickey Rourke, Michael Madsen, and Britney Murphy all giving stellar performances. Fans of the comic will scream in delight seeing all of Miller's great characters on the big screen being portrayed by such big name actors/actresses. Action fans will have scenes that they will talk about for weeks, and the casual movie buff won't be able to deny the amount of polish and hard work that ""Sin City"" contains in providing a great movie experience that should not be missed."
"Jon-87","8","1","2","26 April 2005"," Amazing Characters!
","I thought Sin City was bloody good. It reveled in darkness and sadism, sometimes too much, the heroes were impossibly hardy, it was misogynist, and the noir style got tiring. However, easily trumping those quibbles were the facts that it was thrilling, shocking and incredibly cool looking. The greatest thing about this movie, though, was the characters! Just look at this partial lineup (in no particular order): <br/><br/>Marv -- He's a big lug who can suck up wounds like crazy, spit blood, and quip, ""Is that all you got?"" This guy is the closest thing the movie has to a traditional ""superhero"" type. His powers are tremendous strength, near invulnerability, high agility, the ability to slip out of bonds, and of course a knack for scaring people with his ugly mug. On a morals level, he's no Clark Kent -- he's all about the end justifying the means. Any means, including merciless torture and murder. But the poor guy is so pathetic that a prostitute sleeping with him gives his life purpose; you can hardly help caring for him.<br/><br/>Kevin -- What is this kid's story? He's a depraved, mute cannibal with razor-like fingernails and preternatural quickness and stealth capability who enjoys reading his Bible, yes, we get that, but where did he come from? I'd love to see a whole movie about how he became what he was.<br/><br/>Nancy -- Such a sweetheart! However, with her, the film misses a chance at an even better characterization. She was set up to be the inspiration for Hartigan's redemption, so she should have remained unsullied. Instead, she grew up to be an exotic dancer in a sleazy bar. Her career choice clashed harshly with the wide-eyed innocence, the trusting nature, the naiveté central to what the plot needed her for. Somehow her character still worked pretty well, though.<br/><br/>Gail -- Would she really have killed Dwight if he had not negotiated his way out of it during their confrontation over how to proceed with Jackie Boy's body? Was she in love with him, or in love with the fantasy of being in love? Surely being a prostitute honed her skill so she could have made Dwight believe what she wanted him to believe. I think her true loyalty was to the women under her direction, and that she was using Dwight's genuine love for her merely to manipulate him into helping them.<br/><br/>Cardinal Roark -- Did he have a homosexual relationship with Kevin, or did he really believe the pseudo-spiritual nonsense about eating peoples' souls? Probably both. He seemed the type who thought himself not only above man's law, but above God's law too.<br/><br/>Yellow Bastard -- What an unrepentant, no-conscience sack of pure, petty evil! I must give the movie kudos for daring to highlight a character who is a sadistic, murdering pedophile and getting away with only an R rating.<br/><br/>I give this movie 8 out of 10."

","this movie is rad. perhaps the raddest movie ever made. it's got good actors, a fast pace a visually stunning. the film is told in three stories that center around a fictional city were crime runs out of control. The first story tells about mentally unstable man named Marv searching for the person who murdered his one true love. The second tells of man named Dwight who must stop a conflict between his allies and a powerful mob. The third tells of a cop who tries to protect a girl he saved 8 years ago. This film is truly a live action comic book from the violence to the dialog. what makes this film stand out from other comic book films is that you know what the characters are thinking in important moments. the nudity in this film might turn some people off but hey this a guy's film. A truly great popcorn film this is."
"twistedvirgo0913","10","1","2","24 April 2005"," A Great Movie That Makes You Think About Your City
","I loved this dark tale. Marv out for Kevin was the best story of the movie, I loved how everything in color is used through out the movie to relate stories. I loved this movie and any fan of Quentin Tarentino's Kill Bill series, Pulp Fiction, or Dick Tracy needs to see this film. I loved how seemingly real the story felt, Frank Miller has done a wonderful job bringing all of our myths and assumptions of how we view the world to our attention. I never really thought about Dirty Cops, Politicians being involved with cannibalistic priests who justify a cannibals taste for human flesh by calling the acts Holy, an angel (of all things he would be an abomination of society). Sin City really made me think about my home in Lansing, Mi. I started some crazy analysis on local media, on local government, on local law enforcement, on local religious groups, and my community. It's all created by media, I wouldn't know a damn thing about my neighbors, my mayor, or even our governor if it weren't for the news. The story of Nancy, Goldie, and the Hookers, really made me think about what People want you to know. The line from Rike about power is how many people you can lie to and continue to lie to and make them believe you, it's true. Lies, lies, lies, life is one big lie."
"jaxbubba","9","1","2","20 April 2005"," I LOVED this Film!!!!!!!!!!!
","Based on the graphic novels of Frank Miller, this is a movie that you'll either love or hate immediately. Directed by Robert Rodriguez, Quentin Tarantino, and Miller himself, this film is ultra violence and ultra risqué. Filmed in black and white with hint of coloring throughout, this film is exquisite. It's a combination film noire 1940's style detective novel meets Pulp Fiction, and I just loved it.<br/><br/>The film is a culmination of several short stories, all intermingled. From the opening sequence to the ending credits, the film seizes hold of the audience, and dares you not to be entertained. The black and white is grand and enveloping; which tones down the blood splatter being spewed across the screen. This effect turns a would-be mad-slasher movie into cinematic genius.<br/><br/>This film has everything, from the A-List of stars which include: Bruce Willis, Mickey Rourke, Jessica Alba, Clive Owen, Rutger Hauer, Powers Boothe, and Elijah Wood playing some sort of flesh-eating psycho that's just too cool for words and a far cry from his Frodo character of the last five years; to over the top story lines with ninja hookers, dirty cops, unstoppable vengeful superhuman hit-men, carnivorous were-boys, IRA mercenary militia and corrupt politicians. It's everything that you could ever want in a movie and more.<br/><br/>To try to explain the movie in words, would take to long, and would end up incoherent; let's just suffice it to say, ""You'll have to see it to believe it,"" and leave it at that. I must also reiterate that this film is very adult oriented; if you're easily offended or overly sensitive to adult content and graphic subject matter, then I would think twice before viewing. However, since I am neither of these, I enjoyed this film thoroughly."

Every shot in this film is made exactly how the the pictures in the books were drawn. Even the dialogue is all from the book! Seeing this film is like reading the books with someone else turning the pages for you! They couldn't have picked a better person than Mickey Rourke to play the menacing Marv.

","For those of you that have never really read the books, this movie is dead on in line with the books. A lot of comics these days are more Teeny boopery and Frank miller does a great job of bringing out the tough guy aspects that we all dream about around 430 in the afternoon. NPR has an interview with miller and Robert Rodriguez the director. There are a lot of people that write stories similar i.e. blog dot shiningechoes dot com. Besides the fact of being true to the original story - there is some great background to the whole movie as well. RR wanted to Co-direct the movie with FM, but FM was not a union director so RR actually gave up his Union ship to make this movie. unfortunately for RR he also had to let go of a few deals with big studios because of this. Quintin Tarinto also did a guest directorship - over all this movie is just great!"
"martini249","10","1","2","18 April 2005"," Sin City, Robert Rodriguez's best movie yet!
","Robert Rodriguez has nailed it. Finally a director that understands comics, what they are and how stories are told in them. The whole movie feels like a giant comic book where the only things missing in it are the dialog boxes. Benicio del Toro's, Elijah Wood's and Mickey Rourke's performances are excellent, they seem to have jumped out of the comic page and into the screen. Even though almost all of the movie was shot using a blue/green screen and some people think this didn't look well in the final product, in my opinion it doesn't matter. I was to immersed in the story to notice technical glitches or odd graphics. Robert Rodriguez is one of those rare directors that really loves making movies and understands what telling stories is all about. With Sin City he has shown moviegoers what can be done with a camera and a good story line."
"movieman_kev","8","1","2","17 April 2005"," oh Mickey, you're so fine, you're so fine you blow my mind
","Having supposed to have seen this on opening night, stuff always came up, so here I am commenting on it a day after seeing it two weeks after it opened. Hey better late then never. This is without a doubt one of the most faithful adaptations of a comic book that I've ever seen is this one based on Frank Miller's niorish Sin City. I've always been a fan of both Bruce Willis and Mickey Rourke. Honestly, a fan of Willis by a bit more, so seeing him as Hartigan was great and I liked how he played him. But Rourke as the no nonsense hard-boiled Marv steals this movie. There's no doubt in my mind that it's Mickeys best performance in quite a while (almost enough to make me forget the horrid ""1941"" and ""Heaven's Gate"") Rourke just took the ball and ran with it. Now, yeah, this is a grisly violent film, but somehow, maybe due to how it was shot, one can at least detach one's self from the violence. Or at least that was the case for me. Is it over-rated by being in the Top 250? A reluctant yes, as this is far from a perfect film, (the middle story, while fun, pales in comparison with the other two, some silly dialog, etc...) but it's still a very enjoyable one. And if overly clichéd crap like ""American Beauty"", ""The Matrix"", and ""Mystic River"" can find a place in the top 250, then I won't begrudge this one if it stays there.<br/><br/>My Grade: A-<br/><br/>Eye Candy: Carla Gugino and Jamie King both have nude scenes and both are VERY stunning"
"Devotchka","7","1","2","14 April 2005"," Stylistically amazing, but too gross.
","And confusing, but I suppose that's my fault because I'm not familiar with the books...er, graphic novels. Sin City would have been a lot better without the gore, but might just be worth seeing if you're a film buff interested in something a little different. (That's really who I'm directing this review at, by the way, not those of you who base your opinions of movies on how many people get blown up in them--because I'm just going to assume you'll like Sin City!) <br/><br/>Great cinematography overall and it will almost definitely win some awards for editing, I think. The style of the thing is really neat and incredibly creative. Don't miss Elijah Wood, proving that adorable child actors can successfully become creepy-as-hell adult actors, and Devon Aoki as the coolest character in the whole movie.<br/><br/>But to put it bluntly, I would have been disgusted and bored if not for the STYLE of the film. It doesn't have that much going for it otherwise."
"madmikee","10","1","2","14 April 2005"," Wow, what a movie
","Robert Rodriquez has always been a favorite director of mine, and when i heard that he was collaborating with Frank Miller for third movie, i was instantly excited.

Truly the best work he has ever created, visual euphoria, and such excellent acting. Just a great great movie, i can't keep talking about it without sounding like a geek.

Not only did it keep me on the edge of my seat, it made me feel like I was there with the characters throughout the whole thing.

I also can't imagine what the NC-17 version must have been like before they re-cut i to get a R! I am not the type to get offended by violent movies so it didn't keep me from enjoying this AMAZING film noir adventure!! I was expecting the violence to be like all the other violence we have seen in recent movies like kill Bill or Pulp Fiction and Resivor Dogs. Well, I was wrong. This movie takes violence in cinema up more than a few notches! This movie was visually stunning and innovative but I guess that was to be expected from the trailers.

I enjoyed that the story the most and I was really surprised by the twist at the end of that story.<br/><br/>Now, tell me that I am not the only one that teared up when Wendy told Marv that he could call her Goldie! That was a great scene.<br/><br/>I also really enjoyed the 2 book-end stories. I think it was real cool that it started out with The Man and then borough that back around again at the end. I also like how the Hartigan/Nancy story served as a common thread through the movie. Starting with Nancy as a child and weaving the character through the movie was Brilliant!

"filmbuff-36","8","1","2","13 April 2005"," A fun ride down a twisted highway, with good actors in a disturbing B-movie
","""Sin City"" is one of the more accurately named motion pictures to come out quite some time. There's hardly a moment on screen that isn't drenched in depravity, sleazy filth and urban Gothic horror. It walks a thin line between art and cine-trash, and sometimes it gleefully drops into the abyss.<br/><br/>The story follows three down-on-their-luck individuals who inhabit the fiction Basin City, a town that has been digitally created to invoke film noir at its most intense. The first section follows Marv (Mickey Rourke) is a Frankenstein of a man, deformed in the face but built like a Tiger tank. He just had his first enjoyable night with a woman in a long time only to wake up to find her dead and himself being blamed for the crime.<br/><br/>Driven more by a twisted form of obligation to the beautiful Goldie then a sense of self-preservation, Marv goes on a killing spree across Sin City, hoping to uncover who was behind the murder. In another story, Dwight (Clive Owen) is creep with a sense of honor when it comes to protecting women, and roughs up on a punk named Jackie Boy (Benicio Del Toro) who's an ex-boyfriend of his current squeeze Shellie (Brittany Murphy). Their encounter leads to a confrontation that might end up shattering a truce between the police and a cadre of machine-gun toting hookers. Don't ask.<br/><br/>The final story centers on police detective named Hartigan (Bruce Willis) who stumbles on a child molester who just so happens to be the son of a U.S. Senator. Jr. (Nick Stahl) is left shot up by Hartigan, who is forced to take the rap in exchange for protecting the life of the girl who was to be Jr's latest victim. When Hartigan finally leaves prison, he goes searching for the girl, Nancy Callahan (Jessica Alba), who has now grown up into an exotic dancer. Hartigan is left trying to protect a girl he doesn't completely know anymore from a mysterious killer known as the Yellow Bastard.<br/><br/>""Sin City"" is a grotesque nightmare brought to life. It plays like ""Dick Tracy"" written for ""The Crow"" crowd. If Ralph Bakshi ever directed a live action movie, it would probably be something like this. Legendary comic book creator Frank Miller's graphic novels are brought to life in a world filled with dank back alleys and grisly executions.<br/><br/>What is really shocking about the film is the level of violence. Throughout the course of its run, there are be-headings, hacked off limbs, brutal gunshot wounds and people beaten within an inch of their life. There's even one scene where a man loses something near and dear to him that I'd rather not mention in a polite publication. Nothing is left to the imagination. It's all here, and it's a wonder this film was able to squeak by without an NC-17 rating.<br/><br/>Director Robert Rodriguez creates a believable noir world thanks to and mostly black and white photography with a few splotches of color and green screen technology. He employs it here much better than it was used in last year's ""Sky Captain in the World of Tomorrow,"" but for much sinister purposes. This is a sick exercise in the surreal, and many people won't be able to stomach it. There's stuff here that puts the gore in ""RoboCop"" to shame.<br/><br/>The acting is above reproach, especially Rourke and Willis who really get into their characters. Elijah Wood shows up as a nearly feral cannibal in a performance that is light-years away from his work in ""The Lord of the Rings."" Rosario Dawson is intense as Gail, the lead gun-toting prostitute heading up O-Town. Owens and Del Toro are coiled balls of ferocity ready to explode. Everyone gets into their characters, and you forget you watching actors on screen.<br/><br/>""Sin City"" is destined to be a cult classic, maybe even a box office hit. But each image reeks of human depravity and punishment that it become an endurance test to sit through it all. Fans of Miller's comics should get what they want, but for others, this is a relentless ride down a highway of debauchery that many will wish to exit at the first off ramp.<br/><br/>8 out of 10 stars. It's a visually astonishing motion picture filled with great actors, but you may want to bring a barf bag with you when you watch it."

If they think it should, they should stay home and watch COPS or something.<br/><br/>The colors and or lack of is a bit strange, but this movie couldn't have been filmed differently without compromising the comic book (adult) style. nothing is perfect, nothing is real, There is a message (sort of) but don't take anything seriously,or you'll spoil the experience.<br/><br/>The critics hate it, thats why I saw it and I'll buy the video when it is released."

Brilliant imagery with splashes of colour vividly occurring in some instances. Don't be mistaken though, this film has a lot of comic-book style violence. But the use of stunning white gore effects works well on screen. Awash with an all star cast of anti heroes in a Pulp-Fiction-esk collaboration of different stories all based in the city of sin.

","I went into Sin City with high expectations, mostly because of the opinions of friends and watching trailers more so than any experience I have reading Frank Miller's work.<br/><br/>From the time the opening line plays and the first images show up on the screen, it becomes clear exactly what sort of movie it is: totally over the top, gloriously cliché, and unapologetically violent. Obviously this is something that leaves the film open to criticism from many people - probably justifiable criticism.<br/><br/>I truly enjoyed it, though - exactly because it is so over the top, cliché, and violent, and boldly so. The characters are generally one dimensional, and they are SUPPOSED to be one dimensional: they are caricatures more so than real people. This, added to the striking visuals, make it an enjoyable movie.<br/><br/>Micky Rourke's portrayal of Marv is excellent as an unapologetic, yet somehow redeemingly human, psychopath. The character, to me, came off as the most comic-esquire, from the greatly exaggerated facial features to his blithe one-liners. Also something which seemed to be lacking from some of the other roles, whether because of the portrayal of them or the essential nature of the character, Marv had a seemingly greater self-awareness than any other character in the film - making it a classic portrayal.<br/><br/>Dwight, played by Clive Owen, seems a little out of place to me - perhaps because his past is never explained, he comes off as a somehow hollow character, not entirely fleshed out, as the ignorant viewer (i.e., me) is unaware of his real motivations or capabilities. Dwight also comes off as the most misogynistic character in the movie - because of his attempts to help or defend women which really don't need any knight in shining armor. In contrast, Marv's crusade for revenge is far more human, in that Goldie - and then Wendy - ""ask,"" (in a sense) for his help, and similarly so for Hardigan. Because of these features, Dwight comes across as far less interesting (and his ""crusade,"" less noble or justifiable) than Marv or Hardigan - this is not to say it's a bad character, or a bad job by Clive Owen, but more to say that it did not live up to expectations established by the previous story featuring Marv.<br/><br/>Bruce Willis as Hardigan portrays a character that is all-too overdone in Hollywood cinema, a hero who does the right thing no matter the cost. Redeeming the performance, however, is that Willis seems to fit perfectly into the voice-over, film noir style of Sin City. Overall, the only hard time I had with Hardigan's story (That Yellow Bastard) is that Bruce Willis looks far too young for the role, making the character less believable when his age is mentioned.<br/><br/>Of the other characters, I don't really have much to say either in the way of negative or positive: few stood out, and those that didn't served as a palatable backdrop for the others. Elijah Wood is skin-crawlingly creepy as a silent cannibal (all the more creepy because of his silence, even when being hacked up by Marv). Devon Aoki expands on the theme of silently deadly, again something I mention because in the case of both Miho and Kevin, more is expressed about the character by their silence than by any lines they could have possibly been given. Jackie Boy (Benicio Del Toro) is a solid, real-world sort of creepy character.<br/><br/>I only have a few hard spots with the movie... one being the previously mentioned problem with Bruce Willis portraying a man supposedly well over 60 by the end of the movie (particularly since he doesn't age at all between his first appearance and the end of his story, though many years pass). The other is the extreme physical portrayal of the Yellow Bastard: I understand why the character is portrayed as so ugly, but it comes off as too alien-like on film, to the point that it takes you (or at least it did me) out of the story a bit. This is something that, without having read the comic books (graphic novels, if that's what you wish to call them), I'd guess played very well in ink and paper, but simply didn't work as well on-screen.<br/><br/>Overall, I truly enjoyed Sin City for it's extreme, unreal - yet at times intensely human and realistic (I'm aware that's contradictory, but I can't find a better way to describe it) - setting and characters. The cinematography is some of the best I've ever seen, and certainly the best atypical cinematography to come out of Hollywood in recent years. The use of black and white, with only touches of color, adds a vibrancy to certain things which you are obviously intended to notice: the color forces your attention onto a specific object or event to the point of being totally focused on it. I'd recommend it to anyone who enjoyed Pulp Fiction, Kill Bill, or similar movies. It's a visual treat and an immersive escape into a fantasy world with only a few flaws... and being realistic, every movie has any number of flaws, it's simply whether or not these flaws ruin the immersion of the viewer in the movie, which those in Sin City do not."

I expected this to be a fun movie, but five minutes into the film it kicked into an adrenaline fueled rush that didn't let up until the bloody end. It captured the seedy and violent tones of the graphic novels in a way that I can honestly say I've never seen a motion picture adaptation of any other form of literature achieve. Sin city is what film noir could have been had there been no handicaps leveraged on Hollywood due to ethical paranoia. The lines were delivered in a tone reminiscent to the best detective/crime flicks from the 1940s, and the action, while admittedly over-the-top, gave the picture a feel that's destined to stand out against the usual Hollywood action fare.

"TigerMann","Null","1","2","11 April 2005"," A journey through the naked city of human depravity
","If nothing else, Robert Rodriguez is probably one of the most unpredictable filmmakers of this era. The explosive, hardhitting action of ""El Mariachi"" and ""From Dusk Till Dawn"" sharply contrast with the bright and colorful ""Spy Kids"" trilogy. He's found his niche within the film-making community, yet continues to pull some unexpected rabbits out of his exceptional bag of tricks. <br/><br/>As a particular fan of the gritty, hard-boiled ""film noir"" genre, I was on pins and needles after watching the highly kinetic trailer for ""Sin City,"" the newest entry in Rodriguez's canon. Filmed with high definition cameras and using ultra-expensive CGI in just about every shot, Rodriguez has successfully reinvented not only his own film-making style ... but he also trodden upon a new era in feature film history.<br/><br/>Blending three stories from Frank Miller's pulpy Sin City comic books, Rodriguez and an all-star cast lead us down inside the murky depths of human depravity ... where revenge and redemption are mostly synonymous. We're introduced to Marv, a brutal ex-convict who's found a new lease on life: avenging the murder of a very beautiful, but dead hooker that showed him a modicum of kindness. Marv twists, gouges and impales the truth out of anyone remotely connected to her. <br/><br/>We meet Dwight and a legion of gun-wielding prostitutes ... all of whom act as judge, jury and executioners of ""Old Town,"" a part of Sin City with the kind of brutal lawlessness not seen since the days of the American Frontier. <br/><br/>Finally we're treated to the story of Hartigan, a cop out to prove to himself that his life has some glimmer of value. He protects a girl from the gnarled clutches of a pedophile whose appearance could have been lifted straight off of Chester Gould's Dick Tracy rouges gallery. <br/><br/>I wasn't trendy enough to have read the Frank Miller books when they first premiered, but I've since checked a couple of them out from my local public library and found them quite refreshing. Rodriguez, who is apparently a fervent fanatic of Miller's material, deviates not one inch from these books. The writing, direction and acting were spot on, which has doubtless thrilled a legion of fans. <br/><br/>What I loved the most about ""Sin City"" was its respect for the history of pulp novels and the dark, gritty film noir of the 1940s and 50s. If pulp-masters Dashiell Hammet and Mickey Spillane were still writing fiction today, their work would doubtless resemble the desperate, beguiling atmosphere Rodriguez creates for us in this film. During some moments, I felt that the actual city is not just a setting, but a state of mind that crashes and burns through the screen. It was impressive and I was left hungry for more. Several scenes reminded me of the covers of old pulp magazines like ""Black Mask"" and ""Weird Stories.""<br/><br/>I was also reminded several times of John Boorman's neo-noir film, ""Point Blank."" Starring Lee Marvin and Angie Dickenson, ""Point Blank"" is about a hard-boiled thief cheated out of his cut from a heist. The story of the cold-blooded revenge he inflicts on those responsible could have seamlessly been incorporated in ""Sin City."" One has to wonder if Miller drew any inspiration from the film (or the books in which it was based on by Richard Stark AKA Donald Westlake) when writing and drawing Sin City.<br/><br/>Though I wouldn't venture to call ""Sin City"" brilliant, there are tiny flourishes of brilliance throughout that will invariably leave deep teeth marks all over popular culture for several years to come. I'd love to see a sequel to this film, as there are several stories from Miller's book that would make beautiful translation into film."

This is by far and away the greatest comic adaptation ever made. if anything this year matches this then it would have to be some film, i mean even Josh Hartnett came across as being cool!! The way Rodriguez has filmed this and added his own flavour to film noir is breathtaking in its originality, to take the age old black and white film put it on green screen and add spats of colour made this a visual feast. The story's were all awesome in there portrayal but the standout was Mickey Rourkes Marv, a likable hard man who is framed for the murder of a girl he has only known for a few hours but feels such a strong connection to her that he swears vengeance, and sets out on a mission to kill who ever is behind her murder. the cast in this film is perfect, Clive Owens Dwight, Bruce Willis' Hartigan, Jessica Alba's Nancy and Rosario Dawsons Gail are all brilliant but the magnificent Marv is still the standout character that everyone will remember, a spin off would be much appreciated Mr Rodriguez.<br/><br/>To the people who slate this film i say this, don't come to see films with 18 certificates and then complain about sex and violence, i mean there not called GRAPHIC novels for nothing!!!"

I will admit that Elijah Wood's character (Kevin)disturbed me more than I've ever been disturbed before. How, you ask? You'll find out.<br/><br/>The three narratives tackled in this movie fit well together and all have enjoyable characters and intriguing plot lines. The story of Marv, was my personal favorite, mainly because Marv is the ultimate badass and because it was the story that creeped me out the most.

","As someone who hasn't read the books, and probably should have, i have to admit i was kind of confused, even though the stories weren't complicated i don't think they were meant to go together in one movie like this and thats the only problem i really felt the movie had, that it was 3 movies in one, and should have been 3 movies with one story each, or they should have wrote a new story that combined them all together. Hopefully this one tiny flaw will be fixed on the DVD when they split all 3 stories and add back all the footage in and have the movie available to watch as intended, as 3 short movies, or really a mini series, which as already been confirmed by the directors, so that'll be worth the 20 bucks to buy the DVD. Overall it was definitely a one of a kind movie, or movies, the stories are easy to follow, but there's 3 of them, and the opening and ending don't really fit with any of them, the acting was good and for the most part great, it does get alittle weird and over the top at times but it just makes it more entertaining, interesting, and intriguing, there's great brutal action, some pretty funny things like the arrow guy, its disturbing, sick, hardcore film making at its best, its definitely a guy movie, but thats no problem at all, in fact we guys prefer it that way, especially when we get a nice look at carla, and pretty much every other chick, except for the stripper? what the hell? alba never looked so good, and i was never so disappointed. It was definitely the coolest, most insane, awesomest comic book movie to date, that'll probably not be surpassed until the sequel, i give it a 9 out of a 10, i would have preferred alittle more realism, maybe thats not how the books were so thats OK to make it over the top, and the stories should have run together better or not at all, but really there was nothing wrong with it, if your looking for good old fashioned, new age, kick ass entertainment then look no further."

","This movie (to put this in an unprofane way without being kicked off IDMB) kicks freakin butt!!! I have to go with the the member who says ""this was probably the best I seen Mickey Rourke in a movie"". He steps outside his traditional smooth laid back character like he usually plays and steps in as Marv who is a mix between Wolverine of X-Men and Hellboy. The rest of the characters in the movie are unique as well such as the gangster prostitutes, the serial killin' cannibal dude, his yellow brother, etc. . This is the kind of movie you can watch 10 times without ever getting tired of it. The violence itself doesn't make the movie (it just adds to the action), but it was very well scripted along with a great storyline.and is very original. It's great they tried not to make this movie too ""hollywood and commercial"". They did great at keeping this at a high cult classic quality/grade which is hard now. Most filmmakers tend to make movies ""audience friendly""... you know...attracting the ""pop"" audience.. diluted and polluted , advertised on a ""Burger King"", or ""Taco bell""commercial . KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK MILLER!!!!!!!"
"dj_bassett","Null","1","2","9 April 2005"," Fine adaptation of rather inferior material
","The best way to think about SIN CITY is that it's an extremely faithful adaptation -- in many ways it IS the comic book up there on screen -- of rather dumb material. Frank Miller's world here is loud and cartoonish, full of violence so graphic it ultimately becomes exceptionally silly, macho monologues that are just wincing in their tin-ear notes (easily the worst part of the movie is the dialog, often lifted directly from the books) and women who are really ridiculous fantasy figures for teenage boys: all sorts of hookers with hearts of gold or strippers who'll love you no matter what or waitresses looking for love. Really stupid.<br/><br/>All that said, it is what it is, and it's not bad for what it is. It looks absolutely fantastic, light years beyond what SKY CAPTAIN was able to put on screen. The acting from the guys is all pretty decent: Rourke in particular is exceptional. You really believe in big IL'Marv: the fact that Rourke can make you care about his plight is pretty amazing. All the guns blazing and gratuitous nudity and cannibalistic practices and the like are entertaining, in their way. Rodriguez is a good action-cartoon director: he's particularly good at pacing, and the film never slows down. It's one quick two hours.<br/><br/>Destined to be overrated by certain segments overimpressed by style and underimpressed by substance. Basically belongs in the hopper with KILL BILL and SHAUN OF THE DEAD, though nowhere near as good as those two movies. Okay, though."

"Jonny_Numb","8","1","2","10 April 2005"," cinematic redemption in a world of ""Sin""...
","In ""Sin City,"" director Robert Rodriguez remedies the problem that cripples many a comic-book adaptation: the appeal to reality. While faithful in regard to character and plot, many are too afraid to plumb the depths of a world warped into a full-blown perversion of our own, thus denying the finished product its eyeteeth and turning it into a mere distraction instead of a transformative experience that makes our concept of reality seem pitifully dull by comparison. True to its title, ""Sin City"" is a visionary epic rife with content so vicious that its true impact doesn't settle in until the movie is over. Set against a noirish, black-and-white background (with blood appearing as red droplets or inverted white splotches), the film grips you from the first frame and doesn't let go for 2 hours. The random insertion of color seems almost a parody of ""Schindler's List""--red blood, a rainbow of rain splattering a windshield, the yellow gore of a grotesque creature; these details are like traces of reality settling into a fantastic world, awakening the id-controlled demons that lie suppressed in many. These touches infuse ""Sin City"" with a dramatic pulse that is complemented by its throwback to 1940s film noir style. When the movie began, I was on my guard and a little defensive about what it might hold--some high-gloss adaptations expend a wealth of stunning visual style, yet are poor in story and character; ""Sin City"" is an example of the opposite--while the film follows 3 separate story lines, the main characters are well-drawn, supporting players sparkle, and plots twist with playful frequency. The vignettes consist of a hulk avenging a prostitute's murder; the accidental killing of a crooked cop that threatens a turf war; a detective's quest to save an earlier victim from a psychopath reincarnated as a yellow-faced monster. Contrary to (or perhaps irony inspired by) the film's title, each story suggests a desire to reform that leads to decisions which finally bring about closure, and, in a way, redemption for the characters. Even the narrative gimmick of having the film bookended by an ambiguous character (referred to only as 'The Man' in the closing credits)suggests that the random encounters in our lives account for more than we realize.<br/><br/>""Sin City"" is Robert Rodriguez's most controlled cinematic work to date; even amid its fantastic chaos, he shows a maturity lacking in his previous films--whereas ""Once Upon a Time in Mexico"" and ""From Dusk Till Dawn"" were as loud and bombastic as they were hollow, ""Sin City"" succeeds in moments of quiet reflection, slick voice-over narration, and grizzled facial expressions. The world these flawed characters inhabit is drowned in unpleasantness and death, yet is transfixing in its own hideous beauty--in an era of pulpy, disposable filmed fiction, ""Sin City"" lends both comics and cinema fresh credibility. Well done!"
"MikeHonorama","5","1","2","10 April 2005"," Visually imaginative, disturbing storytelling
","It would be hard to do a better job praising the visual wizardry of this film than many of the posters before me. This movie is simply dazzling, and that held my attention throughout the whole 2 hours.<br/><br/>However, the sadistic violence became numbing. After a while, it became pornographic and fetishized -- it's somewhat disturbing that Frank Miller finds it (SPOILER TIME, YOU'VE BEEN WARNED) compelling to have characters shoot at a man's crotch (and then tops that near the end). This is combined with the constant victimization of women as a plot device. It sometimes seem like more women got hit in this movie than in Million Dollar Baby. This may be the one aspect of literally translating the Sin City comics to the screen -- the hard-boiled, ham-handed plots and dialog that may seem hard hitting on the page, take on an exponentially more visceral impact on screen. Thus, the violence, even at its most stylized, still becomes a bit much."

As angry as we are, we reach out for meaning in a confused chaotic world. We tell the stories we want to tell and yes, we're offended when it's dismissed as a two- dimensional male fantasy, because too many elitist stick-up-their-butt sheep-brains do not see the world we see, and refuse to believe there is such ugliness in this world. But no matter how ugly violence is, there is beauty that can be found. And that is what I took away from this film.<br/><br/>This super-human world Frank Miller and Robert Rodriguez (with Quentin Tarantino) created represents our struggle in a ""sinful"" world.

This was seen early in the total failure of Michael Madsen to deliver lines with any inflection or character. Flat out, this was a brilliant idea, and the visual style was very interesting, but could still not overcome the literal transcription of a comic book duologue into a script.<br/><br/>If you like movies with nudity and violence, and do not mind tuning out the duologue entirely, this is the movie for you.

","I have to say that like others, this is probably one of the best adaptations to screen ever. You can even find frame-to-comic comparisons that match up completely. However, in comics they may show one quick frame of blood and gore to illustrate what is happening. When translated to screen, these frames last much longer. Instead of a quick flash of this, we get 30 minutes of this bleeding, 45 minutes of that bleeding. I fear the marvel of film-making this movie is will be lost on a large audience due to the amount of blood and gore. This is probably the only movie where they have to warn you about castrations in the plural sense. Marve's part seemed to drone on a bit, especially since the violence just seemed to get repetitive.<br/><br/>Much like ""Kill Bill Volume 1"" the violence level will ward some people away from a good movie, but I think Kill Bill did a better job of making the movie violent without putting so much in you get bored."

The guy goes through a lot in a short time. Elijah Wood has a small, albeit very creepy, role. It's neat to see him doing quirky roles after LOTR. The only weak points in the film are that the actresses, in general, aren't very good. I don't know if this is due to the roles they play or just the acting. Either way, they weren't great.

Combine Tim Burton's Batman (sans the humor) with Pulp Fiction and you'll have an idea about the style and pacing of this hyper-violent, ultra-film noir movie. Despite the fact that it is shot largely in black-and-white, the stunning photography and graphics more than make up for the movie's occasional lapses into ""comic bookish"" dialog. Mickey Rourke's turn as the brutal Marv is his best role in years and out of a bevy of some Hollywood's hottest babes(Jessica Alba, Rosaria Dawson, Alexis Bledel among others), Devon Aoki as the ""silent but incredibly deadly"" Miho is a standout.

"FamousSaS182B","10","1","2","6 April 2005"," The must see best film of 2005 yet.
","One word folks....AMAZING. I saw trailers for this movies and i figured ah this movie will be OK. I was wrong. This movie is one of the best and i haven't even read the comics. Jessica Alba is hotter than hell there's no doubt. Bruce Willis and Mickey Rourke are amazing. This movie contains non stop action from beginning to end and it's just excellent if you haven't seen it i highly recommend it. If you haven't read the comics either, don't sweat it. Like i said i really really enjoyed the film. I was asking my drum instructor about it cause he has read them and he said he thought that the trailers looked dead on the comics and he predicted it would be better for me to have not seen it because it would keep me guessing, which is exactly what it did. I think that the only movie that could contest this film for the best movie of 2005 is Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith. Anyways i went to see this movie again and all the people saying it's a waste of money don't know what they r talking about. Two of my buddies said this movie didn't have a plot but Napoleon Dynamite did?!?!? This movie is a lot like Kill Bill.....but this film makes the Kill Bill's and Reservoir Dogs look like an episode of Power Rangers or something weak. Clive Owen is a bad ass in this movie. Just his actions and the way he talks makes him so a bad ass. I cant stress enough how great this movie is!"
"djjazzyjeff84-1","10","1","2","6 April 2005"," Know what you're getting into.
","I loved this movie however I've gotten quite few more refund requests from this movie than any other recently. Know that its extraordinarily violent and racy. Very few movies out in theater stress the artfulness of the presentation. Very few movies accomplish what the creators wanted to convey, this one does.<br/><br/>I have to write 10 lines about this damnit. Alright whatever. The color affects are quite faithful to the comic book. The narration is wonderfully done. The story is confusing as there is time jumping as you go from character to character but its easy to pick up. The twist and turns are great, coming from a guy that didn't even know this comic existed. The violence is immense and humorous. The women are drop dead sexy and the protagonist men are inspiring.<br/><br/>If you know someone who is considering seeing this movie let them know what to expect so I don't have to waste 5 minutes of other customers time processing refunds."
"kingofleprachaun","10","1","2","6 April 2005"," ""sinfully"" delightful
","From the moment I walked out of the theater after seeing this, it immediately jumped to the top of my all time favorite movies list, beating Donnie Darko, Return of the King, and Band of Brothers. The cinematography is astounding and the fact that only certain colors stand out makes it that much better. I'm definitely seeing it at least once more and buying it. Elijah Wood, Clive Owen, Mickey Rourke, Bruce Willis, and Jessica Alba (just to name a few) play what I think are Oscar winning performances. They all play the parts flawlessly and show how good they can truly act. This movie is not for those with week stomachs however because there is an intense amount of violence, most of the blood though is shown as white and looks like white out (an astoundingly cool effect when you first see it) but sometimes it will show up as red. So long story short, a definite must see for all crime-thriller people."
"javold","7","1","2","6 April 2005"," A Surreal Experience
","Saw Sin City tonight, and I can't remember a more bizarre movie watching experience. Five days after its release, at a 7 pm show time an hour north of Chicago, and the theater was dead. The same girl who sold my ticket also sold me my pop and popcorn. And this was a twelve screen theater complex. Two older kids walked up and asked for a a job application, but no one else was buying tickets or concessions. I walked down a short hallway to theater number twelve, and looked in. I was hesitant to sit down at first. The floor was sticky and the armrests greasy, and I saw a few broken chairs down one aisle, but what made me really pause was that it was five minutes before the scheduled run and nobody was there. I even started to walk out, just as the promos were starting, but then I saw trash left over from an earlier crowd and decided it must be a last minute kind of neighborhood. What the hell. I took the perfect seat, in the middle of the theater, two thirds of the way back from the screen. It was just me. I don't usually see movies alone, but the buzz was up. Buzz from IMDb, buzz from local radio shows, buzz from my wife who saw it on a girl's escape the night before. And still, an absolutely dead movie theater in Waukegan, Illinois. Lakehurst Theaters. Six bucks a pop, even though they charge ten bucks just a few miles down the road. Even odder, the promos were limited to one trailer, no ads, only three minutes long and suddenly the movie started. Two or three people drifted in during Bruce Willis's version of a Sam Spade narration. One person had a lights-up cell phone, even took a call about an hour into the film. She was courteous, though, and slunk down in her chair and talked quietly. Three more people walked in midway through the picture, apparently after their first choice ended. One of them was a kid, maybe eleven years old, the others his parents or guardians. They stayed ten minutes or so, which was longer than I thought they would considering the content they walked in on. Then it was back to just me and the first three, but by the time the movie ended and I got up to go, the others had already left before me. I left my trash and walked out in the hall, and still there was no one, no one in the halls between the twelve theaters, no one in the lobby but the one girl who doubled at the ticket and popcorn counter. ""Have a nice night,"" she said, and as I responded in kind, ""You, too,"" I considered that she might have been starved for social interaction. Me, too.<br/><br/>When the theater is more surreal and dark than a movie that depends on those characteristics, it's probably not fair to rate the film, but I'll give Sin City three stars out of four, all for its cinematography and make-up and caricaturistic style. My wife compared it to Pulp Fiction, but please, baby: The soundtrack sucks, there's nothing remotely like Pulp's humor or witty dialog, and for all the names in the cast there's really no acting that rises above the make-up and flash. There is also an air of misogyny in Sin City, and, yes, violence. Tarantino used to pride himself on how his violent shock shots were more suggested than actually on-camera, but I guess the standards have changed. And where the story loop in Pulp Fiction was absolutely cool and original, it felt a little stale this time. Sure, I'll want to see it again, to figure some of it out. But next time, even if it's ten bucks, I think I'll find another theater."
"conan4742","10","1","2","4 April 2005"," Strikingly Visionary
","Sin City is probably one of the more unforgettable films of the year. In this movie are images of dark cityscapes, haunting countrysides, and brooding characters that will stick with you for long hours after you see the movie. Colors and shadows leap to life from the screen. Some, like the glow of green eyes, are sultry and ethereal, whereas others, such as the jaundiced hue of the Yellow Bastard, are horrifically vivid. At any moment scenes become black and white silhouettes, becoming absolute works of art that burn themselves into your memory. The characters and scenes are more like dreams than anything else.<br/><br/>However, although the style is probably the vanguard of the picture, there is substance underneath it.<br/><br/>I'll begin by saying that this movie is not for everyone. It is intensely violent and the plots is classic pulp fiction and noir on steroids. If you are a viewer who does not care for such content, then, by all means, avoid this movie.<br/><br/>Sin City, both the movie and city itself, is ugly. It is gritty, vicious, sleazy and ruthless. It is a rotting, cancerous hellhole of a place, a city without redemption. Yet there are heroes in this story, and they do have depth to them. But because they are heroes in such a place, they, too, must stoop to brutal violence.<br/><br/>All of the characters are men whose empty and hounded lives are validated by the love of a women. Marv is played brilliantly by Mickey Rourke, who perhaps was born for the role. A sad, simple-minded, beast-like thug, Marv is embraced in the arms of a goddess-like woman and given what may be his first night of acceptance and love. The next morning he finds her murdered in bed next to him, and, refusing to let go of the brief reprieve she gave him, wages war on the underground of Sin City to find her killer and uncovers a lot of dirty secrets in the process.<br/><br/>Dwight (Clive Owen) is a mysterious stranger about whom the viewer knows almost nothing but his intense devotions to Gail and the Old Town Girls, a mob-like confederation of prostitutes who police their own territories. When the abusive, drunk, and misogynist Jackie-Boy cruises into Old Town looking to lick his ego's wounds by beating up the first girl he finds, Dwight is ready to kill and willing to die as a result of the consequences.<br/><br/>Bruce Willis plays what may be the most heart-breaking of all the stories. He plays Hartigan, the one good and noble cop in a city of vipers, and so the entire world is immediately against him. Hartigan is the only cop in Sin City willing to take down Junior, the insane son of a hellishly corrupt Senator who gets his sexual kicks by torturing, raping, and then murdering young girls. Hartigan, unable to bear the thought of skinny little Nacy Callahan, age 11, torn to ribbons at the hands of a perverse monster, hunts down Junior and risks everything he has. In trying to do the right thing, he loses all his friends and allies and is brutalized by Sin City, but never, ever gives up.<br/><br/>Many people will deride Sin City because of its stylized direction, graphic violence, and outlandish characters. However, if you have the patience to get enveloped in the world of Sin City and maybe suspend you disbelief for just a moment, you'll find a rare gem of a film. I'll admit it starts out weak, and perhaps a little unexpectedly. But the movie picks up soon and shows you dreams you never even thought could exist."
"flyyy4awhiteguy","8","1","2","4 April 2005"," Violence + Art = Cinema Glory
","Robert Rodriguez with Sin City creator Frank Miller took a vision and transformed it into reality. The film Sin City is a magnificent step forward in Cinema technology,the film utilizes current advancements in blue screen,by the makers of Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow, to bring out the comic like feel of the film. The entire movie can be considered art. Although many individuals will complain that Sin City is vulgar, sexist, and flat out wrong I argue that it is brilliant. It's a film that captures pure violence and shows that nobody can be a hero without breaking a few of the ""good guy"" rules.<br/><br/>The film in reality is 3 separate stories all taking place in Sin City and interweaving between one another. Each story containing it's own hero, whom is constantly being beaten and punished for doing the right thing. And each sadistic villain becoming worst as each is introduced. This is not tale of love, or a comedy, it is pure violence at its greatest. Each scene will have you wanting to look away but yearning for more. To not feel the pain these characters endure, and to not even comprehend the drive they have to look past their own well being to do what is right is a pity some will be blinded by the blood and violence and not even understand the characters. This film is phenomenal and should be watched by anybody that does not have a weak stomach. (9/10)"

","I was anxiously awaiting Sin City ever since I heard that it was going to be a live-action film. But throughout the months that led up to its opening, I was constantly asking myself, ""Could they pull it off"", ""How can they film this scene"", ""I hope they don't make it politically correct""...<br/><br/>All I can say now is, ""Wow"". This movie is excellent... But keep in mind that I'm a fan of the Graphic Novels and I could understand why someone would hate this movie. The movie is very dark and violent (just the way I like it) and I've already seen it twice. The first time, I was in awe and comparing the book and the film in my head. The second time, I just sat down and took it in with awe. Everyone (7 different friends) I went to the movies with also loved it as well and only half of them (3) have read the books.<br/><br/>The coolest thing after watching this movie was when a guy on a date behind me said ""Wow, that was the greatest movie ever"" and his date said ""That was disgusting, I want to go home""."
"Hell_Staind","10","1","2","4 April 2005"," The Best Film of the new Century
","After seeing Sin City the only word that I could use to describe it was brilliant. I was truly amazed about the visual effects and the way the colors in the movie were done, It made the film feel unique and gave it this touch of dramatic visual emotion. The acting was great from most of the actors and actresses with the exception of one or two. Bruce Willis was awesome and Mickey Rourke as Marv was the coolest character I have seen in a long time. The one actor that I didn't care for that much was Michael Madsen, I have come to the conclusion that he is not the best actor in the world. The way the film played out was a monument to the 1920's and 30's Crime movies only Sin City was about 100 times more violent, which in my opinion made the movie all that much better.<br/><br/>I have to say that Sin City truly is a city filled with nothing but sin, and while trying to not give away to much information I can tell you that I believe they tried to work into the film all seven of the deadly sins. The pure lack of any truly good characters in the movie may turn off some spectators, but if you don't enjoy a movie that doesn't have some moral code that it follows then you probably shouldn't go watch a movie called Sin City. One of the most memorable characters in the film and most disturbing was Kevin who was played by Elijah Wood, This character was probably the movies greatest representative of the meaning of sin.<br/><br/>Sin City is the first masterpiece of the new century. It is beyond anything that has come out in at least five years and is now in my eyes on the top ten list. Sin City is also the best comic book adaptation I have ever seen. I read one of his graphic novels right before I saw the film which should tell you that I was not aware of Frank Miller's work until this movie came out, and I have to say I think the just used the comics as a script. The Film would truly make any one who was a fan of Frank Miller the happiest person in the world, and I am not just talking about the visual effects. To say the least this movie mad me more then happy that is why I am giving it a 10/10."
"srbestafka","Null","1","2","4 April 2005"," One of best films of last 10 years
","I just got back from Sin City and have to say that this film easily exceeds most of its buzz. The biggest danger I thought it faced was too much novelty and once that wore off the film itself might be suspect...don't worry. It is not. The atmosphere is brilliantly setup in the opening ""framed"" Josh Hartnett story. It gets you used to the environment and the mood of the film. Then something abruptly happens that prepares you for what is to come. From there on in I was completely glued to the screen. I could not wait to see what was coming next...and not just visually, but in story, classic lines of dialog, etc. Very riveting. I will say that although this is extremely violent, since it is so stylized it does not appear as gory as many people are saying. Many of the acts themselves are very violent but in the B&W or slightly colored world of Sin City these acts are simply devices in the film, not gory, gratuitous violence. With that said, anyone under probably 16-18 should stay far away from this film...the subjects are way too strong. Bottom line though is this is a modern classic and something I am already eagerly awaiting on DVD...truly one of a kind and not since Pulp Fiction has a film so dramatically altered what we have come to accept in modern film. Although not for everyone and perhaps having a lesser broad appeal than Pulp Fiction, this film in my opinion will make that kind of impact on modern film, how movies are made and will undoubtedly spawn many imitators. 10/10!"
"saracino001","10","1","2","4 April 2005"," Bad Ass
","I personally thought this film was brilliant. The way everything was expressed. There was drama, action, a hint of romance and of course danger. It also was a very gruesome film but it was given a splash of crazy colors used instead of red for blood, and in scenes like when we see a human being eaten by a wolf. Sin City is filled with amazing characters.The three main characters are Hartigan(Willis) Marv(Mickey Rourke) and Dwight(Clive Owen). The film is about these three men and the scores they have to settle. Sin City has great performances from Bruce Willis, Mickey Rourke, Jessica Alba, Clive Owen, and Devon Aoki. This film def. opened my eyes in shock to how glorious movies still can be. The one thing that i didn't like about it is the fact that it was all shot on a Green Screen. Aside from that its film bliss, a must see for all movie fans.<br/><br/>I give it a 10... (On Principal)"

Sin City is the best movie out there and the first one I seen in Black & White and with a little color as well. This movie did extremely well and will be a classic in the years to come.

"lachmann","Null","1","2","4 April 2005"," ""Forever and Never""
","This was the closest thing I've seen to a stylistic cinematic explosion. So lush and stylized as to be suitable for framing. The acting across the board was excellent. All three male protagonists totally dove into their roles without winking at the camera or condescending to the over the top noir dialog. Visually, it was absolutely stunning. The dialog was straight from the graphic novel. That may ultimately be it's Achilles heel in a way. I saw it twice this weekend. Let's face it, movie audiences are generally young. I could tell that the noir dialog referring to 'dames', 'broads', getting ""plugged"", 'mitts"", ""Kill him. Kill him good"", etc... were generally not part of the younger audiences point of reference, even historically. They often simply didn't really 'get' the dialog on it's own level. It may have fallen flat or simply made them chuckle. In my opinion, that's their (the younger audience's) problem though. Rodriguez and Miller wrote it true to the genre. My only criticism was that it ran slow in spots. Very forgivable though. This is a truly original movie. You don't get that very often. This will be one to own on DVD."
"occiferm","10","1","2","3 April 2005"," Sin City pushes the envelope and sets the standard for any Non-Mainstream comic-book movie
","Fantastic movie. This is the first real ""translation"" of a comic book or graphic novel as opposed to an ""adaptation"". This is a true-testament to the power and beauty of the source material. <br/><br/>Sin City, albeit extremely violent and gory, hearkens back to older, more simple days, when the movies had terrible villains you wanted to see killed. The villains in this movie are the true scum of the earth, and the heroes are all tragically flawed. Despite these simplicities, the characterizations of the main players, Marv (mickey Rourke), Hartigan (Bruce Willis), Jackie Boy (benicio del toro), Dwight (clive Owen), was done very well. The stylized black and white, with intense lighting contrasts was amazing and groundbreaking. The use of color is both purposeful and powerful in every scene it is used. I especially thought the performance of Bruce Willis, Mickey Rourke, and benicio Del Toro were fantastic, with Rourke putting in his best performance to date.Miller and Rodriguez have done a great job. I can't quite figure out which scene Quentin Tarantino directed but I believe it's a scene with Devon Aoki's character, which seems very Kill Bill-ish. Anyone who is a fan of the comics will fall in love with this movie. Anyone who likes movies such as kill bill, pulp fiction, dick tracy, will also love it. <br/><br/>I would like to disclaim to everyone that while some of the characters have greater than life powers, Hartigan's and Marv's ability to take a beating, Elijah Wood with long, stabbing fingernails, it is NOT a superhero movie. It is a very intense, and graphic crime action/drama with very archetypal yet engaging characters.<br/><br/>This movie's uniqueness demands that everyone give it a first chance at least. I searched for something wrong with Sin City yet found it quite flawless. The only problem i had with this movie is that being in Austin, I did not get to work on it. I urge everyone to give it a chance."
"rain_fallen_tears","10","1","2","3 April 2005"," Sin City ********** (10 out of 10)
","*No Spoilers that I am Aware of* At this point in time the best movie I have seen! Frame for frame it follows Frank Miller's work of art, comic series. Each storyline, told on its own...there own movie. Each character played as if the actors weren't acting at all....they WERE the heroes, villains, and innocents of Sin City. Mickey Rourke, Bruce Willis, Elijah Wood, Nick Stahl, Benicio Del Toro, and Clive Owen....it gives me goosebumps just thinking of Elijah Woods chillingly perfect portrayal of Kevin(creepiest villain of all time). Mickey Rourke was Marv, mind, body and soul. Bruce Willis wasn't Bruce Willis any more but Hartigan...no arguments. Nick Stahl, can never just be Ben without me picturing his creepily accurate portrayal of Yellow Bastard/Junior. Benicio Del Toro IS Jackie Boy! And Clive Owen....oh Clive Owen. Dwight's embodiment, one of the best performances ever. Perfect, sexy, and brilliant. One of the greatest characters on paper brought to life on screen. Damn is he sexy, words just can't describe it. All the leading ladies, Rosario Dawson, Brittany Murphy, Jessica Alba, Devon Aoki, Alexis Bledel all were equally as good in their roles.And in the directors chair, Robert Rodriguiez knew exactly what he was doing bringing the world Frank Miller created to the screen, with out one minor slip up. The only thing I did miss was Marv's monologue about the rain and the few pages where he went to retrieve Gladys from his mom's home. But trust me this is no complaint everything else was PERFECT! COMPLETELY AND UTTERLY PERFECT! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED"
"Bigcritic73","10","1","2","3 April 2005"," Stunning,
","Sin City is a visual masterpiece. Rodriguez has finally created his coup de grace. I can't say I'm the biggest fan of Rodriguez, however, Sin City succeeds on many different levels. While Rodriguez has established own style with such pieces as ""El Mariachi"" and ""From Dusk Till Dawn"", Sin City stands out in a visual league of it's own. From the beginning to end, it challenges even the most intellectual viewer.<br/><br/>Violence is the centerpiece of the three stories. Love and loss are ancillary when considering the primary focus of Rodriguez's talented vision of Miller's work. View this picture as more than just a story -but as a painting in violence. Bullets and blood are stylized in a cartooneque ballad of the operatic worthy of Miller's namesake - ""Sin City"". Visit the comics and relive them through Rodriguez's recreation. Miller's contribution is apparent throughout in the special effects, if that's what it's called these days.<br/><br/>The violence is stomach turning. The audience in the theater gasped screamed and exclaimed ""DAMN!"" many times through the movie.<br/><br/>The individual performances by Willis, Rourke et al. were dazzling. When considering that the actors played their parts in front of a completely CGI backdrop, it becomes apparent that they are clearly incredible. Score this with Rodriguez's compositions, and one observes a final masterpiece.<br/><br/>Enjoy."
"nestlequ1k","10","1","2","2 April 2005"," Best comic adaption yet
","Sin City is a very stylized adaptation of the cult ""graphic novels"" (comic books) of Frank Miller. It takes 3 of the more interesting substories in the 7 book Sin City collection and weaves them together very much like Pulp Fiction. Being that the director Rodrigez & Miller used the actual comic stories themselves instead of movie storyboards, the movie stays extremely close to the original works.<br/><br/>The first thing you've probably noticed about the trailers is the black & white comic book style screen rendering. I was skeptical that they could pull this effect off but it turns out to work incredibly well. The feature is it enables colorization of the key elements of the movie giving them more attention. It also portrays a very surreal world that enabled the movie makers to do very interesting things that would probably make you roll your eyes if you saw it in a traditional style movie.<br/><br/>The most important warning that any responsible reviewer will initially give is the unbelievable vulgarity & violence of this movie. Violence not in the sense of people just dying. Violence in the sense of dismemberment and very sick and disturbing scenes of poor girls getting miscellaneous body parts chopped off. Everything is shown as if to purposely disturb the audience. If this movie didn't have the comic book, unrealistic look and feel to it, it definitely would have been NC-17 and maybe even worse. If you don't want your kids or sensitive wife to be traumatized for a while, keep them the hell away from this movie. They'll have nightmares for the foreseeable future.<br/><br/>However this shouldn't stop those of you from seeing it who thoroughly enjoyed films such as Pulp Fiction, Reservoir Dogs, Snatch, Man on Fire, and the Punisher. Actually, aside from the aforementioned, the movie this most reminds me of is Payback, with the very cool voice over effects, atmosphere, and the fact that most of the 3 stories involve some kind of revenge by an initially not so nice person. Many will compare this film to ""Kill Bill"", but Sin City is a lot more serious, darker, and ten times better than that Tarantino hackjob piece of crap.<br/><br/>Acting is top notch as you would expect with such a large talent pool. Jessica Alba is incredibly beautiful. Bruce Willis is amazing. My favorite however is Elijah Woods, the one you'll see with the mirrored glasses. Very courageous of him to agree to play this role. His character is unbelievably cool and he plays it well (without even saying a single word).<br/><br/>Final Rating: 3 and a half stars. It would have easily been 4 stars if it didn't gross me out so much, but I liked the plot, the look, and the overall ""coolness"" of the movie so much that I'll be seeing it again and pre-ordering it on DVD."

Anyway back to the film, I enjoyed every last minute of it, I thought that the stories where all so interesting and well written that I found my self lost in every one of them, to the point where I almost forgot that I was watching a different story, and that there was even a story before it. Whoever the critic is that writes in the Dallas morning News, let me just say that I do not like this guy. He said how the stories weren't deep enough or along those lines. Well they are short stories genius, and its not gone with the wind dramatic, for its genre which I would place it in new age film noir, its perfect, though it is 100% a guy movie, it is one of my new favorites, its perfect, the scene composition is beautifully done, and the colors, though obvious make the dominant and the intrinsic interest of the scene become alive, straight out of the comic..... I loved this movie - Nathan"
"T1Thousand","8","1","2","2 April 2005"," One of the Sins of this film is that it ended
","Whew. Finally a memorable movie this year. It is a different movie, a stylish movie. I really love the fact that it is in black-and-white with bits of color. It really reinforces scenes, detail, and meaning. The direction was marvelous as were the visuals. The acting was good and the characters were convincing. I followed through this film and it was one heck of a ride. Let me say this though: I have not read the comics. It was probably why I did not care to see this film even after the second trailer. But after reading up on it and finding out some details about the film and comics, I ended up thinking that I should give this a shot. Heck, the black-and-white gave me more of a reason. I already knew the direction and cinematography were going to be amazing. I was not wrong. This modern film noir is very entertaining to watch and the jazz music sets the mood and tone just right. People will say that there are no characters with heart in this movie, but I will have to disagree. Yes, everyone is corrupt (maybe with the exception of Nancy). Yes, nearly everyone kills someone. But we actually get a sense of these characters and root for the ""good"" ones--the heroes--to get what they want. That is what a good movie is about. Having not read the book, this must have been one great adaptation because everything went smoothly and I did not get confused and I was not full of questions. The three stories are intermingled and they do connect somehow, and I thought that was interesting. Everyone is basically a strong character in his/her own way, and that is one strength of this movie. Enough praises though. I am sure that you have read all the praises possible for this. I will go on to the few negatives now. Sometimes you will be able to tell that the background was generated and lose the authenticity of the setting. You start to remember that this was all done on green screen. Some other slight flaws are too insignificant to mention here. One of the Sins of this movie is that it ended. Yes, even with the few ""bad"" features this movie has, you bypass them and enjoy watching. When it was about five minutes toward the end, I actually wanted it to keep going. But hey, I was satisfied. To end off, I want to say that YES, this film is extremely violent and disturbing with characters killed and tortured in almost every way possible. So if you could not handle something like Kill Bill or Pulp Fiction, you will not be able to endure this one. But if you liked the above movies, you will be able to endure and enjoy this one =) <br/><br/>7.9/10 Stars"
"sutherlandaj","8","1","2","2 April 2005"," Written Review of Film- Journalist
","If Frank Miller, writer of the Sin City graphic novels, was skeptic of Hollywood before Sin City, director Robert Rodriguez has relinquished those worries from him. Miller had sworn that a movie from his novels would never exist, after all how could a movie capture the depth and artistic side of the city he had created. And then Rodriguez approached Miller with a short film that showcased how the movie would be made.<br/><br/>The short film named The Customer is Always Right, featuring Josh Hartnett, is the opening scene of the soon to be, in my opinion, blockbuster Frank Miller's Sin City; a film that does not disappoint Miller's fans and those unfamiliar with him alike. Filmed entirely in front of a green screen with the backgrounds added in post-production the film offers the look and feel of a comic that has yet to be experienced.<br/><br/>The film is based in Basin City and offers the audience a look at the ruthless, the love and the hate that exists in this film-noir setting. The film is askew with violence, gore, dismemberment, and yet it is a sinfully artistic, and at points amusing, saga that houses three of Miller's stories.<br/><br/>To date probably the darkest, and excuse the pun again most cynical, film I have seen all year; although easy to say because it is only April. Miller, creator of the 1991 Sin City, and Rodriguez, Director of From Dusk Till Dawn, split the director's chair and even managed to give film violence king Quentin Tarantino some time in the seat.<br/><br/>To set the scene one would have to imagine a city where the citizens hardly see daylight, the cops are corrupt and prostitutes run their own town through consistent gun power keeping the gangsters away. Sleazy bars are home to the largest and toughest of men and even they still seem to take a beating. But they become harmless at the sight of the gorgeous women that plague the city and make it much too easy to fall in love.<br/><br/>Marv, as an example, played by Mickey Rourke is the largest of large who is thrown around by cars, spits blood with grin and still seems to dismantle three feet of concrete at ease becomes harmless once in the arms of a sultry lady of the town named Goldie. Goldie is found dead and the rest of the story Marv promises to, and succeeds to, draw ""gallons and gallons of blood"" in an attempt to find the killers.<br/><br/>There's the surprising love that keeps the one good cop in the city, John Hartigan, pushing for justice while on the brink of retirement. He fights through corrupt cops and highly connected citizens in an attempt to rescue an eleven year old girl from the dark grasps of the city.<br/><br/>The amazing visuals are not left alone but are supported by an assortment of mentionable performances. Rourke has found his best role as of late and Bruce Willis' presence offers his usual tough and tender performance. Benicio Del Toro, a jealous boyfriend named Jackie Boy, and the pleasantly creepy Elijah Wood as the psychopath Kevin gives the film the support it needs. The women are equally notable, including Jessica Alba as Hartigan's dream girl; Rosario Dawson as the gun-wielding hooker named Gail; Brittany Murphy as a street smart waitress who links all three stories; and Devon Aoki as Miho, the deadly sword wielding fighter that offers a Kill Bill worthy performance.<br/><br/>The stories are magical, and to some extent become hypnotic with characters that create a hybrid mix of a comic and a film. You might enjoy the lengths and the intricate detail that has perfectly transformed the stories of The Hard Goodbye, The Big Fat Kill and That Yellow Bastard or you may not. It is a matter of appreciating the success of the film and noting the historic heights that it has created for this genre of film and the work that directors have done to uncannily mirror the comics."

","Horror filled, oddly photographed travesty that is one of the most disturbing ""films"" ever made. Unrelentingly disgusting and violent beyond all comprehension, this is a movie to be avoided by anyone with a modicum of human decency. A good cast is defiled by their work in this project and their motivation for appearing in such an amateurish abomination are certainly perplexing. These are actors of some stature and this is something that is not only beneath them, with the exception of Rourke, but sewer level. The depiction of what can only be described as shocking drug and alcohol consumption, perverted sex, ultra diabolical violence, and smoking should have been stomped into oblivion by the studio behind this. A horrific example for youngsters, with its comic book look, that is exactly the audience such a movie will attract. There is talk of a sequel and the thought of such a thing chills one's very soul. This film is supposedly based on something known as a ""graphic novel"" but there is nothing novel about this except<br/><br/>the overwhelming amount of human suffering shown and that is what is so graphic about it as well. Public outrage regarding such unlimited and ugly mayhem must be expressed by an intense letter writing campaign in utmost protest accompanied by a massive theater boycott. No human eyes should be subjected to the abuse a catastrophe like this inflicts! Those responsible for its production should be barred from the entertainment industry for all time and the results of their work shredded. I am certainly posting sharply worded letters to the studio, theater management, the agent of Bruce Willis, and the Times at once. I sincerely hope it is not too late to forestall further damage to our young. In the name of humanity and civilized society, we must not remain silent!"

From beginning to end it was nothing but cheesy similes over and over. I know they're going for the comic book feel but when every line is a one liner it gets to the point where you stop caring about the characters and the story because every time someone talks it just feels like acting. I'm all for different but it's hard to watch a movie when you can't connect with the characters.

","There are challenging innovative movies, that you like before you understand. This is not one of them, although thousands of people seem to have been persuaded the contrary. There are plenty of violent and meaningless films, that one may enjoy thinking that life is, after all, often violent and meaningless. But ""Sin City""'s Robert Rodriguez and Frank Miller took good care to make you understand that their story has nothing to do with life: it's just a comic-book tale. So, this meaninglessness has really no meaning. There are movies that try to innovate by including techniques from other arts or media, e.g. comic books. But ""Sin City"" is entirely a comic-book made film, or rather a comic-book-turned-zoetrope. There are movies inspired by comic-books that are set in some sort of (dystopian) near future that could make (some) sense. This one, just like ""Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow"" kept almost intact the ""near future"" of the '30s and '40s described in the original comic-book. But whereas ""Sky Captain"" seemed a playful gaze into the world of comics, ""Sin City"" takes itself seriously. Rodriguez shares with Tarantino and Tim Burton a fascination with the puerile world of ""pulp fiction"". But Burton (through his imaginative situations and settings) and especially Tarantino (through his effective art of funny absurd dialogue) take a witty distance. Rodriguez believes in the magical powers of hebetude. There are flawed intelligent movies. ""Sin City"" is a perfect dull one."

","Sin City is truly a crappy movie. The best part of this movie is the ending because that's when I knew the credits would start to roll and the theater lights would came back on. There were four of us who sat through this awful flick and four of us who still haven't figure out what took place. I thought some of the blue screen effects were well done especially the car scenes. I found nothing wrong with the acting. Don't remember the music or even if there was any so that just about says what I think of the sound track. What turned this movie into one I wished I hadn't seen was the story line: Not clear, didn't make sense, huge gaps of missing data, none of the characters had any redeeming qualities, graphic mayhem, attempts to gross out instead of attempts to entertain.

"noralee","Null","2","7","4 April 2005"," Film Noir Re-Invented in a Dazzling Fictional World
","""Sin City"" is a sizzling tribute to the impact of 1930's noir fiction on popular culture imagery.<br/><br/>So it was amusing that my husband and I were more than twice the age of the other audience members and we were enjoying laughing out loud to the satirical references that none of them seemed to get.<br/><br/>I hope all the attention to the violence won't keep away other people who are old enough to remember the roots of graphic novels in the hard-boiled detective in a corrupt city book and movie genre, as the film is actually much less gory than ""Kill Bill"" and such action films as ""Assault on Precinct 13"" and has a lot in common with ""L.A. Confidential."" While the crimes that are described or committed are macabrely heinous, descending from the progenitor noir ""M,"" we actually don't see them directly, as the camera either pulls away or we see them in silhouette or after. So it is the power of your imagination that turns your stomach.<br/><br/>Imagination is set free in a highly stylized, mostly black and white universe beget by ""Metropolis"" and much more effectively realized here than any of the ""Batman"" movies, as color, particularly blood red, only appears for emphasis.<br/><br/>As the intersecting stories flash back and forward, we also find that some of the characters actually survive their tortures, albeit transformed physically or psychologically.<br/><br/>Most of the actors fit into the hyper-reality of this fictional world, particularly Bruce Willis, a sinuous Jessica Alba and virtually unrecognizable Mickey Rourke and Benicio Del Toro. The planes of Clive Owen's and Rosario Dawson's faces look great but they are having so much fun playing atypical roles that they can't keep the requisite straight faces and don't generate the necessary chemistry. Owen's Brit accent slips in occasionally (I was wondering if like Hugh Laurie's qualms in ""House, M.D."" that those sentences had a lot of R's in them) while Dawson does have to wear what must be the most uncomfortable thongs and stiletto heels.<br/><br/>The women's position in this society and therefore in the film is of course problematical. While the only opportunities for women are as scantily clad bar maids, entertainers or prostitutes, we're supposed to respect that they have brokered empowerment among the powers that be to run their own businesses that capitalize on men's baser needs, as well as having an overly stereotyped mysterious Asian assassin as one of their own.<br/><br/>The women are the fulcrum of the film as their exaggerated knights errant are obsessed to the death with defending them and their hard fought position in exchange for even a little artless affection from them, which raises the view of women here a smidgen above teen boys' comic book fantasies. I haven't yet looked at Frank Miller's source material to know if Alexis Bledel's character originally does call her mom a lot or if that was added for an additional pop culture reference layer to ""Gilmore Girls,"" as the dialog and the images are full of such touchstones.<br/><br/>The music is terrifically propulsive in adding to the momentum.<br/><br/>But that is just one of the many components that multitasking Robert Rodriguez has taken care of himself to create as enveloping and more exciting a visual environment than the ""The Matrix"" movies."
"zetes","9","2","7","3 April 2005"," Robert Rodriguez is an undervalued talent
","I rarely hear anyone mention Robert Rodriguez as one of the best directors today, but he really is. He's the definition of an auteur. He does his own thing, and the movies he makes are completely his. Who cares that they're pap? There is such a thing as great pap, and Rodriguez, though he might not get the kudoz he deserves today, is the king of it. And, judging by his insistence at Frank Miller's directorial credit on the film, which led to Rodriguez's resignation from the DGA, he's a great collaborator and a grand example of modesty, as well. Sin City is an exceptionally entertaining film. It's not deep, but it's engrossing. The script is made up of three (and a half) short stories, starring some of the most wicked anti-heroes of filmdom. Mickey Rourke's segment will probably be best remembered. He plays a giant thug trying to avenge a prostitute who gave him the night of his life. Clive Owen plays a murderer just out of plastic surgery who wants to protect an abused girl (Brittany Murphy) from her ex-boyfriend (Benicio del Toro). Things get out of hand when the two men wander into a section of town run by lethal hookers. The final main segment, which actually wraps around the other two, involves Bruce Willis as a cop who saves a young girl from violence, only to be framed for that very violence. Rodriguez doesn't shy away from either the film noir or comic book origins. Instead, the two sources explode. The Raymond Chandler-esque dialogue is a hoot. This will be one film to be remembered when making our Best of 2005 lists."

Five minutes into the movie, you find yourself mentally screaming at the screen: ""WE GET IT! You wanted to replicate the printed version verbatim!"". And this film solely relies on this trick to entertain. <br/><br/>There is really little more to this film than the color gimmick. Unfortunately, the writers/director did not want to put one second of thought into how to adapt the printed version for the screen. A comic is not the same thing as a movie. You need to put some depth into the characters, the situations, the story, mostly because films have this ability to carry a enormous amount of information, details, imagery, and audiences expect it as such. Here, the people in charge simply chose to transpose everything as is, hence the enormous void of story, detail, content, and why the whole thing moves at a murderously slow pace.<br/><br/>And such a waste of so many good actors. A bunch of nobodies could have done the trick just as well. Somehow you can see how they have no real idea what to do, where to go, what their purpose is, and just in for the paycheck.<br/><br/>This film could have been a glory of style over content, if only the style didn't bore beyond the first 5 minutes."

This scantily clad gang of prostitutes perpetuates a ridiculous image of women whose power is attained only in a herd-like detachment from society.

It is awesome. Amazing. Innovative. Brilliant.

Not since 1999's The Man Who Wasn't There by the Coen brothers have I seen such a beautiful use of simplicity. It forces cinematography to weave us throughout the streets and the dim-lit back alleys of Basin City, where the lights tell the story of how an interconnected cast of unique players spend their lives teetering between good and evil.<br/><br/>Sin City is not only worth your $9 admission for it's beauty and clever storytelling, but also for the numerous moments where you will think to yourself, ""This.

","I've never been a fan of anthology films. I like short films, but I don't understand the reason to package them together with some very loose tie. In ""Sin City,"" the link among all the segments is that they take place in Basin City (not Las Vegas), a fictitious city in the west, not the one in Washington state. The city is nicknamed Sin City. It's a crime-ridden place, and the segments each focus on some murder, kidnapping or other scandalous occurrence in this city. At one point, I thought the movie had circled back onto one of the segments, and was therefore going to tie everything together. I don't mind an anthology film as much if it doesn't something like that. Then I realized that portion was merely acting a sequel to the earlier segment. It's a gritty film, and done in a neo-film noir style. 
 This film is base on a series of graphic novels set in this city. In an attempt to duplicate the artwork in the novels, this movie is in black and white, with only occasional splashes of color, usually red. In many scenes, often those that are particularly bloody, anything red is colored in, presumably to symbolize sin. The common sins that seem to pop up in each segment are sex and murder. There is one character that is colored yellow (not I caught the symbolism behind that), but again this duplicates the artwork in the graphic novels. Well known actors make appear in some of the segments such as Mickey Rourke and Elijah Wood. A raked up a ton of nominees and wins in various festivals for the film as a whole, for cast members and for technical aspects; but it was not recognized by any of the major film awards such as the Oscars, Golden Globes or BAFTAs.

A-list action stars rub shoulders with snaky villains and sexy wenches, in a city where the streets are always wet, the cars are ragtops and everybody smokes. It's a black-and-white world, except for blood, which is red, eyes which are green, hair which is blond, and the Yellow Bastard.

The girls kick ass and the villains are slimy; in particular the loathsome bad guys are the best parts in the film. There's Nick Stahl as creepy paedophile the Yellow Bastard; Elijah Wood as a fantastic cannibalistic serial killer, and finally Benicio del Toro as a slimy woman-hater. The violence is endless and bone-breaking, with limb-lopping galore and all manner of gruesome torture to engage the crowd. Not sure of the rewatchability of the piece but for the first viewing, SIN CITY is a breath of fresh air."

"rjsf96","10","1","3","10 March 2015"," ""Worth Dying For, Worth Killing For, Worth Going To Hell For""
","These immortal words that issue from Marv's mouth before the killing of a corrupt Priest echo throughout the film. They actually act as a phrase that I myself would use to describe the lengths I would go to, so that I can watch the film time and time again. The film is adapted from the graphic novels that bear the title 'Sin City'. It is Frank Miller's own creation, his baby, and his masterpiece. It is only fitting that he is in charge of directorial duties with Robert Rodriguez and a certain special guest director by the name of Quentin Tarantino.<br/><br/>Nothing has ever been made to the levels of artistry of 'Sin City' and nothing ever will be. The film is an exceptionally crafted one that defies reason, logic and gravity. But let me try my best to explain the plot or all three of them. This is because 'Sin City' is broken up to three acts but in UN chronological order as well as the prologue and immediate end of the picture. Just like Tarantino's 'Pulp Fiction'. What is actually stupendous is that 'Sin City' stands on its own two bleeding legs.<br/><br/>From the first opening shot, we are enlightened. The colour palette of the film is unique, with hues of black, white and grey, Miller choosing to occasionally add a splash of colour. Whether that be dazzling blue eyes, gorgeous blonde hair or the flowing ebb of red hot blood. In the opening prologue we see two characters upon a balcony, they gaze at each other, chat and embrace. The man promptly shoots her in the stomach. With almost an inaudible whisper he utters ""I'll never know what she was hiding from. I'll cash her cheque in the morning"". Welcome to Basin City; corruption, greed, gang violence, guns and prostitutes. It's a dirty place to live.<br/><br/>Even Bruce Willis as the loyal and hardened Police Officer John Hartigan manages to get himself mixed up in it all. He is weary with grief and nervousness. Roark Juniour played creepily and jitterishly by Nick Stahl is on the hunt to rape and kill his fourth victim, eleven year old Nancy Callahan. Hartigan tries to prevent Roark from committing these atrocious acts. But with every life hanging in the balance there is a price to pay. Willis appears elevated by the screen time he gets, and offers a varied performance full of heart and soul. He is sad to have to say goodbye and so are we.<br/><br/>The second distinct act of Sin City is devoted to the character of Marv, played with swaggering and scary intimidation by the never better Mickey Rourke. Marv wakes up after a one night stand only to find his lover Goldie, dead. He goes on a hunt to seek justice for this indecent crime. He even comes face to face with the silent but violent Kevin played gleefully but most astonishingly of all by Elijah Wood. What happened to the innocent little Hobbit from 'The Lord of the Rings'? It seems that even the best of people can turn awfully nasty from staying in a place like Basin City for too long. Kevin is more than a match for the brutish Marv and the tension was beyond excruciating. My heart almost left my body.<br/><br/>The third and sadly final act of the film concerns Dwight played by the brilliant and truly marvelous Clive Owen. Dwight helps his girlfriend Shelley, when her ex-boyfriend the abusive Jackie Boy comes a calling; Benicio Del Toro who gives the film a stand out performance plays him with verve. Dwight convinces Jackie Boy to leave, in his own aggressive manner and then proceeds to follow him after he has left. Jackie Boy stupidly harasses a young and naïve prostitute in the seedier parts of the town, where the hookers run the joint and not the police force. All hell breaks lose and Dwight becomes entangled in the whole dramatic event as well.<br/><br/>If you do not feel jolted by the events that take place, then perhaps you do not realise just how ballsy 'Sin City' really is, stylistically and structurally. The film never backs down or becomes scared of the gory levels of violence that it exhibits in unflinching detail. If you are faint hearted now might be the time to turn on 'Toy Story'.<br/><br/>Furthermore, the music crackles and fizzes through the combined magic of Rodriguez and John Debney. The score reflects the horrific acts of violence on screen. But God help me, I was pummeling my fists into the ground for further sophistication, graphic violence and awesome score cues. Perhaps this film has changed my very nature, to the point where I am beyond redemption. But I figure, small price to pay for watching a bold, brutal and brilliant masterpiece of the twenty first century.<br/><br/>Robert Rodriguez, Frank Miller and of course the influential Quentin Tarantino work wonders and unleash all hell on screen with this graphic novel adaptation. Witty lines are ever present, grittiness overcomes all and the performances are bloody marvelous! The style that Miller adopts is directly lifted from every frame of the graphic novel and of course is eye popping! This just makes me scream for more! If 'Sin City' does not make the sick, twisted devil inside you shout with delight, then maybe you are best suited to watching the latest young adult novel adaptation instead."
"coreyjdenford","10","1","3","10 January 2015"," The comics got it right
","Frank Miller's Sin City and Director Robert Rodriguez work together to make this violent and brilliant action thriller. It's a monochrome classic with with brilliant violent action scenes but it is a bit weird because some of the characters come back to life but I guess that's how it's done in the comics. Plus with guest director Quentin Tarantino him and Robert get it just right and make it very dark. There are ways you can tell this came from a comic because some of the characters get flown through the air about fifty feet. Elijah Wood who plays Kevin is a sadistic psycho serial killer with long fingernails that can scratch your eyes out and plus he is a cannibal. One small problem with this film there is 12 certificate stripping in an 18 certificate film from Jessica Alba who plays Nancy Callahan. <br/><br/>Overall 10/10 and one of the best comic movies I have ever seen."
"wileycmm3","10","1","3","5 January 2015"," Fantastic
","This has to be one of my favorite movies of all time. The visuals are stunning, the action is adrenaline pumping, its dark, and it is perfectly formatted from graphic novel to film. I am a huge film noir fan and have always been looking for the film that would suit my preferences, and I think that this movie is the one that does it. The actors play their roles from the comic perfectly(especially Bruce Willis and Jessica Alba). For anyone that hasn't seen it be warned, the film is broken up into four different stories, so when the credits start rolling on one of them do not get up and leave the movie is far from over. I'm not going to spoil any of the stories though. Overall this movie is fantastic, it is unique and perfectly adapted from Frank Millers stories. This is not just a movie based on a graphic novel it is a graphic novel made to look similar to a movie thats how good of an adaption it truly is. I suggest to anyone who has not seen it to go rent it or download it immediately because this movie is amazing."
"hall895","5","1","3","3 November 2014"," Style isn't enough
","Few movies are as stylish or as visually striking as Sin City. The movie looks spectacular, featuring beautiful black-and-white cinematography with little splashes of color which are used to very good effect. The visual effects are very well done which is rather important since the entire movie is basically one visual effect after another. So, in adapting Frank Miller's famous graphic novels, Robert Rodriguez unquestionably got the look right. But while the look of a film is important ultimately success or failure is determined by the story. The story is always the most important thing. And in Sin City the story, or in the case of this particular movie multiple stories, disappoints. Miller's tales may have worked very well in graphic novel form. But something has been lost in translation.<br/><br/>The movie tells three stories which are only very loosely connected. Unfolding in a very strange, ultra-violent, rather corrupt metropolis each story centers on a good guy taking down a bad guy or two. And these good guys have a lot to say which brings us to the movie's first problem, an unrelenting voice-over narration which wears thin very quickly. Each hero narrates his own story and they narrate pretty much every single second of them. These guys just will not shut up. Never is there a peaceful, quiet moment to let the movie breathe. And this movie could sure use a little peace and quiet mixed in with all the bloody violence. By the time one of our heroes carries on a running conversation with a dead man you're quite ready to put your fingers in your ears. But the movie still has a long way to go from that point. And at times it's quite a painful slog. Even with all the action and mayhem the movie manages to, quite remarkably, be rather boring.<br/><br/>All that style but so little humanity, that pretty much sums up Sin City. Very rarely does the movie make you actually feel anything. Of the three heroes it's the old cop Hartigan, played by Bruce Willis, who comes across the best. You really do root for him in his noble quest. Nobility is in short supply in Sin City. Mickey Rourke plays hero number two, Marv, who wakes up next to a murdered woman and vows to avenge her death. A solid performance from Rourke but Marv is a tough guy to root for. As heroes go he's a rather brutal one. The lines between good and bad, hero and villain, are often blurred in Sin City. At times those lines are wiped away completely as is the case with Dwight. Clive Owen plays this guy, a man with a sketchy past, who in the course of trying to protect the city's prostitutes (bad-ass girls who really don't need his protection) eventually finds himself in the aforementioned conversation with a corpse. It's this segment which really grinds the movie's momentum to a halt. And the movie never really recovers. There are some big moments, some cathartic triumphs. But there's also so much stuff which is entirely mundane. And will those narrators please shut up? The star-studded ensemble cast does the best they can with the material. Willis is very good, Rourke does well with a challenging role. With the possible exception of Jessica Alba who's a little flat (a problem since her character is the heart of the film's most emotional story) all involved do fine work. But the stories, at least as they're presented here, just don't work well enough. Sin City is a spectacular-looking movie. But movies can't get by on their looks."
"bowmanblue","10","1","3","7 September 2014"," 'Sinply' the best
","'Sin City' is one of those rare films which most people can actually agree on – and the general consensus is that it's excellent! And, I can't really disagree with that. I would say it's a film for men. It has pretty much everything a guy (and perhaps an 'action film' enthusiast) could want. But, there are also a lot of women out there who enjoyed it, too. And that goes to show that it's actually more than just shooting and hitting people again and again.<br/><br/>It's not so much a story, but a collection of three main stories, all set in the same city ('Basin City' to be precise). These stories sort of play off each other and interlink, but remain mainly separate throughout the film. Then there's the look of the film itself. It's pretty much all actors being filmed against a blue screen and then having a weird, computer stylised background added on afterwards. It's about now that I should mention Sin City is based on a comic book series. Maybe that's why the black and white (with occasional relevant colour) computer background works so well. It really does add to the atmosphere, creating a seldom seen look to a film.<br/><br/>Then you have the cast. Simply put, Sin City is an A-list ensemble of recognisable faces. And, like all the best actors, every one puts in a perfect performance (although some people have criticised Clive Owen for letting the side down a little – maybe, but nothing to really let the whole film down).<br/><br/>So, if you like your action films, your comic book films, your stylishly shot films and interlinking stories in general, you should have already watched this by now. Even if you hate it, you'll probably appreciate that what you've watched at least attempted to be a little different to the norm.<br/><br/>http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/"

"jimbo-53-186511","4","1","3","21 May 2013"," Fairly silly, but still manages to be mildly entertaining
","First of all, I would like to start by saying that I have never read any of the comics on which this film is based so my review is purely based on what I saw. Sadly, what I did see was pretty disappointing.<br/><br/>The film is based on 3 story arcs with each character following their own course of redemption; Hartigan (Willis) the dedicated police officer with a heart condition, Marv (Rourke) a tough guy who acts as 'vigilante' when his prostitute girlfriend Goldie is killed and Dwight (Owen) who is intent on ridding his current girlfriend Shellie (Murphy) of her evil ex Rafferty (Del Toro).<br/><br/>Part of the problem is that all of the characters are uninteresting and lack any kind of depth (the exception being Hartigan who had a fairly interesting story arc and was better developed than the other characters). Another of the film's problems is the cartoonish way in which the violence is depicted - I'm aware that it is based on a comic and was meant to be a bit silly, but to me it just looked stupid and a bit lame. If I wanted to see someone get run over at 100 miles an hour and then get up and start walking around, I would watch a cartoon. I was almost expecting Porky Pig to come on before the end credits started rolling saying 'T-T-T-That's all folks!'. Sin City is also very repetitive and the narrative quickly becomes boring (I felt that there was way too much narrative and not enough dialogue). This film is similar in style to Pulp Fiction except it lacks interesting characters or witty dialogue which is a shame as this might have made Sin City a pretty decent film.<br/><br/>It's not all bad though, the cinematography is outstanding and Sin City really manages to capture the noir feel (particularly the shots of the characters whilst they are driving) and also the way that Sin City is depicted is fantastic - they really did a great job in making it look grim, filthy and disgusting. The film also moves at a fairly brisk pace and doesn't become boring. The acting was also excellent by nearly all involved (particular praise should go to Mickey Rourke and Benicio Del Toro as Marv and Rafferty). Del Toro wasn't in the film for long, but he really stole every scene he was in and it was a shame he was given limited screen time.<br/><br/>Bruce Willis character, the generally good acting and the impressive cinematography helped in preventing Sin City from being a complete disaster. His character was at least interesting and was a character that I found that I could symphathise with. Many of the other characters were either under developed or one dimensional and I just didn't care for them.<br/><br/>All in all, Sin City was a pretty disappointing film. If you are between 16-21, male or you like films with lots of scantily clad women and aren't bothered about a decent script then you may enjoy Sin City. For anyone else, I'd give it a miss."
"igorekh","3","1","3","20 April 2012"," Unbelievably boring
","I first tried to watch Sin City about 2 years ago and ended up turning it off after about 15 minutes thinking what a piece of garbage. However, I generally trust IMDb ratings especially when the number of people who rated the movie are more than 100,000. So today I decided to give it another chance... this time I turned it off after 30 minutes, and this time I am sure that I will never watch it again. It is not the violence, which I don't really mind. I like Reservoir Dogs, or Kill Bill. I love Pulp Fiction. They are also violent movies, but they have human beings as their main characters. The characters are sometimes sadistic, unpleasant, evil, etc, but still human. Sin City on the other hand is about comic book characters, who have nothing human in them, except maybe for the bodies, and even the bodies can take countless bullets, hits to the head by sledge hammers, or be repeatedly hit by a car without showing any ill effects 10 minutes later. Well, I can also watch a fairy tale and completely suspend the disbelief if that is needed for the advancement of the story. But there is no story in the movie either. A fifth grader could've come up with a deeper plot, and a five year old experienced more complicated emotions than any of the ""characters"" in this movie. However, despite my general dislike for the movie, I tried to be objective in my ratings. It had quite good visuals, and that is why I give it a 3. But if you want to watch a movie that has something, beside a series of stunning pictures, stay away. And when I use the phrase movie has something, beside stunning pictures I do not mean deep meaning, real life problems, I mean it as an opposite of complete void, because Superman, or Die Hard are Shakesperean tragedies compared to this garbage."
"real_kurvos","9","1","3","11 March 2011"," Overrated, but pretty good
","Since I tell people I love Watchmen more than any other movie, they have constantly told me ""Dude, if you love that one, you will love Sin City as well!"". I've heard it so many times, I just had to buy it now. And now when I've watched it, I will give my honest opinion - starting with the good stuff.<br/><br/>I really, really love the style. Black and white with a touch of bright red or yellow colors or even bright white at places makes this movie really heavy on style; and I can not say I mind it. I actually prefer when movies are in their own style - that makes them stand alone more. That's why I hate for instance drama movies mostly, and generic comedies and such - they don't have their own style. The fact that they have actors in this movie I could never believe to be in here is just great. Bruce Willis is in here; and I love his character's attitude. Mainly because it's Bruce Willis, but anyway. Another one I was really shocked about he was in here is Elijah Wood. Did you seriously know he was in this movie? So, you would figure he is some sort of nice and worried side-character who's getting involved into all this by accident and just wants to be left alone? I thought at least that myself when I noticed he was in here. But I got a shock of a lifetime - he plays a villain here. And he is one of the most creepy and scary villains I have ever seen. He is this sort of stealthy acrobatic assassin who's also a cannibal, and wears a pair of glasses that usually shines white. And he never speaks a single word. He is so cocky and creepy in this movie; he doesn't react to being tortured and mutilated. He just stares at the one doing it, while looking completely calm and confident AND giving a subtle smile. This innocent and cute little hobbit from Lord of the Rings has now turned into a potential nightmare! I kinda dig some of the stories as well for what they are. It's splitted up into several stories - like in Pulp Fiction, sort of. You get a good look of how it is in this Basin City - or Sin City.<br/><br/>All that being said, I realize it is not by far the masterpiece people claim it to be. Let me explain. First of all, it feels a bit too slow-moving at times. I get the indifferent feeling at occasions, because there's just not that much happening. Maybe it's because I have the extended version - I don't know. But the real problem I have about this movie is... well, it's based on a story made by Frank Miller. The women are portrayed as being sexual and whore-alike, while still being worshiped as gods by the male heroes. And the males are just shown as ""not-worthy"" brutes who can sacrifice themselves for women anytime. Marv wants to avenge the death of a hooker to the point of him sacrificing his own life because... uhm, she slept with him. No, really; that's the only reason. Bruce Willis' character kills himself to protect a stripper who has the hots for him (I bet Frank Miller is dreaming about being him from certain perspectives). It's just really trying to show how little equality there is between the two sexes... and I really can't appreciate that. And of course, all the villains are evil and mean to women - especially hookers (Miller's in-official goddesses). Not to mention; all this just makes it feel like Frank Miller is one big fat homophobe. If nothing else, he is a dirty perv.<br/><br/>Regardless, I still really liked this movie. Did I love it though? Sort of. Is it a masterpiece? Nope. Is it better than Watchmen? Not by miles. It's just a very cool and stylish movie that feels like a live action comic book movie - and I still admire that. But this is undoubtly an overrated movie."

","Sin City... based on the widely praised graphic novel series of the same title.<br/><br/>I think the very title of the film is a good indicator of whether somebody should watch it or not. ""Sin City"". You are going to witness sexuality and bloodshed in a way you've never seen before. The CGI backdrop of Basin City is cartoony and unrealistic - but that serves the purpose of the stylizing. Now, the greatest achievement is that Sin City provides the viewer a realistic level of interaction with these comic-book backdrops. The characters are hit and miss. The hits outnumber the misses tenfold, though.<br/><br/>Hits: Marv, Hartigan, Junior, Dwight, Shelley, Jackie Boy, Miho, The Irish assassins, Cardinal Roark (BIG ONE RIGHT HERE), Kevin, The Salesman, Becky, Bob, Marv's PO, Goldie & Her sister, and a few others. Frank Miller plays a dirty Catholic Priest Misses: Gail and a couple of the Old Town girls (Dallas notably). The lines seemed a bit forced. This doesn't knock my 10/10 back to a 9, though. I understand that while Rosario Dawson isn't the best actress to play a femme fatale like Gail, she's definitely cut out for the look. And if you know anything about Sin City... the 'look' is what sets it apart from other noirs. Jessica Alba was the right girl to play Nancy... It's just I don't appreciate her acting enough to count her as a hit. The little girl who played young Nancy was pretty spectacular (and adorable). I mean, it's difficult to place a newer actress like Jessica Alba alongside with industry veterans like Bruce Willis, Michael Madsen, Micky Rourke, etc. I'm not saying she's a bad actress. I'm just saying the other people involved are some of my favorite character actors/actresses and it created a huge contrast.<br/><br/>Anyways, I'm cutting this review off here.<br/><br/>The story is great, the lines are well delivered for the most part, and the artwork does justice to the graphic novels. You can watch this without being a fan of the books. If you like sex, violence, and good story-telling... do yourself a favor and go rent this."

","BEING part of the Post War Baby Boom, having been born into a Blue Collar Working Class family; it was only natural that Comic Books would be a staple on the monthly reading & entertainment menus. Starting at some date in 1952, we started getting TREASURE CHEST at St. Theodore Elementary School. Designed for Catholic School kids and it carried stories of Saints, Historical Incidents and a Serialized Adventure Strip about a real cool,kind of a coach & mentor. The title was 'Chuck White' and it kept us coming back for more month after month, at least during the seemingly never-ending school year.<br/><br/>OLDER Sister, Joanne Ryan (1942-90) was a 5th Grader at this time; she from time to time brought home a copy of ARCHIE Comics or some such similar publication. We preferred the likes of DENNIS THE MENACE, LITTLE LULU, BUGS BUNNY and just about anything that was had a WALT Disney theme.<br/><br/>THEN it happened. After the passing of several years, at about 10 ½ years, the then declining Super Hero/Costumed Crime Fighter genre struck us. It was the Summer of 1957; the same year that the Ruskies launched their Sputnik, Joanne's younger brother (me!) tried out for the Little League and Gramma Fuerst (our Mother's Mother) died at 77 years of age; as did our Uncle Ed Ryan (Dad's younger brother) at 39.<br/><br/>ADDITIONALLY to these milestones, another occurrence collided with my young and relatively uneventful life in the house on South Damen Avenue. Although it is an admittedly happening of much lesser importance, it nonetheless seemed to mark me for life. Our gang discovered guys like SUPERMAN, BATMAN, THE FLY, THE JAGUAR and THE PHANTOM in the Comic Books that were always available at Cal & Eleanor's Damen Drug Store;which was right there at the corner of 65th & Damen Avenue. Of all those available characters, there was one who absolutely captured my imagination. Guess who he was? GIVE UP, do you? Okay Schultz, it was BATMAN. <br/><br/>AFTER reading and really getting into these stories, this writer literally wanted to be Batman; so much so as the super hero was the theme of our costumes that Halloween, with yours truly donning the blue serrated edged cape, bat-eared cowl, gray pajamas and blue boots, trunks & gloves of the Batman. Mind you that this was nearly a decade before the great Camp Batman Craze on ABC TV.<br/><br/>IN THE ensuing years ever since there have been heap lot of changes and developments in the Comics Magazine Publishing field. There came specialty shops that sold only comic books and related materials. These Comic Shops handled a plethora of titles; a seemingly galactic number of titles. They also had certain age ranges targeted, with traditional kiddy publications and running up to some strictly '""Adults Only"" stuff. These so called 'more sophisticated' stuff gave rise to a new sub-species, the Graphic Novel.<br/><br/>TODAY'S reviewed movie, SIN CITY (Troubleshooter Studios/Dimension Films. 2005) is the adaptation of one of these 'growed up Joke Books.<br/><br/>BEING the brain-child of Comics writer & artist, Frank Miller, the adaptation and (shared) directorial duties fell to the stories creator. This means that it have received a fairly close of a rendering as its screen play and characterizations. At this we can only guess or surmise about its veracity by what we hear from others; as we are not at all familiar with the Graphic Novels about (Ba)Sin City.<br/><br/>IN having screened it at the LaGrange (Illinois) Theatre's $2.00 special showings, we do feel competent in giving testimony of our opinion in that film's behalf. As far as a its being a truly different sort of movie from a technical point of view; it sure fits the bill there. Other than SKY CAPTAIN AND THE WORLD OF Tomorrow (consortium of companies/Paramount, 2004) and Mr. Frank Miller's recent adaptation of Will Eisner's THE SPIRIT (Continental/Odd Lot/Lionsgate, 2008) we can't think of any example of this technique of marry animation art with live action.<br/><br/>THIS use of the widely disparate processes makes for some truly spectacular scenes and creates a whole array of other possibilities for future projects. Certainly genres of film as widely diverse as Science Fiction, Historical, Biblical, Super Hero or whatever would benefit from the spectacular scenery and ""sets"" that could be made.<br/><br/>AS FOR our rundown and lowdown on SIN CITY, we have to give a heavy hearted report of a mixed review. Whereas the images and characters were both fascinating & very interesting, and the action sequences were neatly done and not really overdone, which could have been a real temptation to do; the action, the plot lines and the surroundings left us sort of in a negative state of being.<br/><br/>COMPLICATING matters even more was that accompanying this writer to the Movie Show on that evening was Mrs. Ryan (Deanna), who had even less familiarity with the subject matter than did meself (with all of my experience in comics). Well what can we say; except something that reasonably approaches the truth, and nothing but.<br/><br/>IN CONCLUSION, Ladies & Gentlemen of the Jury, we can enjoy and appreciate pretty much any story, however off-beat, in whatever medium from strict prose, graphic sequential art, spoken word or as a play-be it legitimate theatre or filmed. However, we don't have the ability to get into the spirit of the language & interaction between characters in the story. ""With a body like that, she could get any guy she wanted; if she wasn't a lesbian"" exclaims 'Bob' (Michael Madsen).<br/><br/>BETWEEN passages like that and action such as having one guy beating his opponent in one of those filthy, scummy gas station-like bathrooms and pushing the opponents head into the dirty toilet bowl, replete with whirling fecal matter as it was flushed; well, you get what we're driving at, no?"

","I admit I didn't get through it. Stylized violence, like any art, has its place, and murder, blood, and ugliness can be instructive. The implied beating of the prostitute in the original ""Cape Fear"", coupled with her subsequent terror peeled a layer off the persona of Robert Mitchum's character, for example. But to take violence and accompanying stupidity to the lengths in Sin City, with no perspective or reason made me feel uncomfortably like a visitor to the Coliseum in Hadrian's day. The issue is entitlement. One is shown depravity without a sense that this is not what mankind can or should be. Like a video game there is no moral compass. It is ""okay"" because it isn't real. But we live our reality and to the point one excludes understanding and perspective one can become trapped by that lack of understanding. One can live in a personal ghetto that doesn't allow for much reasoning. I hated Sin City not because it is bad art but it is horrific example. I don't think that is something we need at present."

There is not a single thing wrong with this picture and I would even say that it's a sheer masterpiece. I'm not exaggerating.<br/><br/>It contains an all star cast that all give brilliant roles.

","In the lawless metropolis of Basin City, also known as Sin City, three tragic tales unfold; a grizzled cop on his last case to save a kidnapped girl, a disfigured avenger seeking out who killed a hooker that befriended him, and a full-scale war between the authorities and the not-to-be-messed-with working girls of Old Town ...<br/><br/>Based on a series of graphic novels by Frank Miller, Sin City wins all sorts of points for originality - it goes for an almost completely black-and-white look with animation-style layout backgrounds, film-noir photography and lots of frenetic comic-book action - and it is a dynamic visual piece of work. However, I couldn't help but feel, probably because it's all done digitally (arguably the first feature to do so) and it combines so many influences that it's a little bit soulless, a little bit flat. Rodriguez is so gifted in his techniques and so well-versed in his graphic art that he forgets some basic good practice; some of the movie is jumbled and confusing, and the visuals occasionally distract from the plot, rather than enhancing it. Compare it with Creepshow, my favourite comic-book adaptation, which goes in totally the opposite direction both colour-wise and stylistically, and is a much richer picture. There's lots to enjoy here however; of the three tales, my favourite is the middle one (The Hard Goodbye), with Rourke terrific as the deformed, self-deprecating, enemy-smashing, man-machine Marv. The rest of the wild cast are good (I liked Wood best as Kevin, the silent, enigmatic, cannibal killer who meets a sticky end) with a high quotient of the eye-pleasing Rodriguez/Tarantino Dangerous Dames stock troupe present, notably Dawson and Gugino, and Miller himself appears as the padre who gets whacked in the confessional. Good gruesome fun throughout, with plenty of nice oddball ideas - the band of Irish mercenaries, the eloquently bickering henchman, the moment in the bar when the protagonists of all three stories suddenly come together - but not quite as imaginative or enjoyable as some of Rodriguez' other work (From Dusk Till Dawn, Spy Kids). I wish he would make a quieter, less pyrotechnic ally-charged movie, and see what he can really do. Anyhow, this is still terrific entertainment by anyone's standards and a highly original piece of work. Quentin Tarantino is credited as Special Guest Director, whatever that means."
"secretagent_007","10","1","3","9 January 2008"," Sinful, But in an Awesome Way
","Okay, let's just get it out of the way: Sin City is not a movie of substance, it is a movie of style. There is an obvious difference, and both are usually required on some level, but every once in a while one can replace the other. There is no point to this movie other than to be as bad ass as possible. It has a chauvinistic attitude towards women, the violence is reprehensible, and the language ain't too far behind. So basically, I love it. There is a certain poetry to the stories presented, a sort of cadence to the characters' words and actions. Take this dialogue, for instance, uttered at an even tone, not shouted or even indicating any real emotion:<br/><br/>""I'm Shellie's new boyfriend and I'm out of my mind. If you so much as talk to her or even think her name, I'll cut you in ways that'll make you useless to a woman.""<br/><br/>It's gritty and tough, like what the disfigured son of sandpaper and bronze would say if it had but lips to part. It is an extreme version of what anyone imagines themselves saying in an action picture scenario. There's loads more, look:<br/><br/>""This is blood for blood and by the gallon. These are the old days, the bad days, the all-or-nothing days. They're back! There's no choice left. And I'm ready for war.""<br/><br/>""It's time to prove to your friends that you're worth a damn. Sometimes that means dying, sometimes it means killing a whole lot of people.""<br/><br/>""I'm on my feet for about ten minutes before the cops kick them out from under me. They don't ask me any questions. They just keep knocking the crap out of me and waving a confession in my face. And I keep spitting blood all over it and laughing at how many fresh copies they come up with. Then along comes this worm assistant district attorney who turns the recorder off and says if I don't sign their confession, they'll kill my mom. I break his arm in three places and I sign it.""<br/><br/>Poetry! I don't know if there's anyone who can get a thug's inner thoughts down on paper as well as Frank Miller can. If you don't know, this was based on a series of comic books by Miller, and when I say ""based on"" I mean modeled directly after. What Gus Van Sant did with Psycho, Robert Rodriguez has done with Sin City. Nearly shot for shot and word for word, this IS the comic book on-screen. Shot in black, white, red, and the occasional splotch of yellow, it perfectly captures the feel of the comic in motion. This was one of the pioneering ""green screen movies"" like 300 and Sky Captain, so the post-production crew had almost unlimited ability to play with the footage and create the living graphic novel. What for, you ask? I say, why not?!?<br/><br/>So, fine, people can say it doesn't mean anything. That's okay. Not all movies have to have some sort of agenda it is trying to steer its audience towards. Sin City is good for that other reason movies exist - to entertain. It's an amusing, cartoonishly violent, hardcore film noir that only exists to be an example of pure genre. I do not believe it was meant to be taken seriously and at face value, nor do I think it's possible to do so anyway. To anyone who complains of its violence, sexism, and lack of pure, gentile characters, I say go take your pill and come back when you want to have a little fun.

Rodriguez uses the computer technology in black and white with some paint here and there which results in an explosion of perfectness. During the two hours I never wanted it to end, I often get restless watching long movies but not this time. Every actor plays it's character exceptional, especially Mickey Rourke. Elijah Wood's character must be the coolest character by all time.<br/><br/>I didn't hesitate a second to give it a 10 out of 10.

","When this movie hit theatres I have to say I was skeptical. I never was a fan of comics and/or graphic novels but the preview gave me enough general interest to give it a shot. And let me say Thank-you promo guys because if I hadn't went that first time then I probably wouldn't have gone the other three times nor bought the DVD.This masterpiece brings you right into the graphic novel. Visually this stands alone. I find it incredible that SIN City is completely green screen where Sky Captain failed this succeeded. Frank Miller and Robert Rodriguez two greats in their respective fields have combined talents to create one of the greatest films I've ever seen. I never was a fan of graphic novels not because I thought they were not well written I personally am too lazy to read them and this film is just some more proof that Frank Miller is truly great at story and character creations and that combined with Robert Rodriguez abilities too direct and visually create the scene they have dawned a new era in film making.What can I say about the acting well besides Micheal Madison's dismal performance and might I say small part (thank god) the acting is superb. Especially Mickey Rourke his performance almost makes the film for me the Marv character is one of the best in any movie. I could say a million more things that are great about this film but the best thing I can say is Just Watch It!!!"

"VincentBauer","10","1","3","20 July 2007"," ""An old man dies, a young girl lives. Fair trade""
","From its opening scene to the closing credits Sin City is everything I hoped it would be. A masterpiece. As bloody and violent as it is, the movie itself gives eye candy. Even without the action, the movie itself is great. The plot is on key, the acting superb, and the direction beautiful. Not to mention the visual effects which were absolutely stunning.<br/><br/>The movie itself is set into several different stories all interlocking, similar to Pulp Fiction (Tarantino even gets to guest direct one great scene). The movie takes these stories directly from Frank Miller's comic book. I might also add that every scene is an exact frame by frame motion of the comic book and even has the same feel. It gives you the neo-noir feeling, and where it's corny in other movies, it works here.<br/><br/>Every main character narrates their own story. Det. John Hartigan(Bruce Willis) narrates ""That Yellow Bastard,"" Marv (Mickey Rourke), ""The Hard Goodbye,"" and Dwight Mccarthy(Clive Owen) narrating ""The Big Fat Kill."" All are extremely well narrated and their dialog (or should I say monologue) is well written.<br/><br/>The first story shows The Man (Josh Hartnett) meeting a woman in a red dress(Marley Shelton) in which we learn the how dangerous Sin City is.<br/><br/>The next is the first part(one could even say the prologue) of ""That Yellow Bastard"" as Det. John Hartigan struggles to save Young Nancy (here played by Mackenzie Vega) from being tortured, raped, and killed by Junior Roark, the son of the dirty U.S senator. What's interesting about this part is that it shows Hartigan's dedication to his job and the romance he and Nancy will have.<br/><br/>The next is ""The Hard Goodbye. Marv (Mickey Rourke), an aging psychopath who gets daily pills from his Parole Officer Lucille (Carla Gugino). He's so grotesque, he can't get any woman. Except Wendy. The one girl who shows kindness to him is killed when he wakes up. Marv can't stand it. Who would want to kill her. He wants answers, no matter how he's gonna get them, and there's going to be hell to pay.<br/><br/>Afterwards we are entertained with a pleasantly long story, "" The Big Fat Kill."" After witnessing Jackie Boy (Benicio Del Toro) beat up his ex-girlfriend Shelly (Brittany Murphy) , Dwight McCarthy decides to follow them to make sure they don't cause trouble. He follows them into Old Town (what we could call Red Light District), and they are killed by the girls of old town. However there's a bomb shell. Jackie Boy's a cop. A hero cop not to mention. Along with the help of Gail(Rosario Dawson) and Miho (Devon Aioki) he must dump Jackie Boy's body (along with his friends who were along for the ride) to prevent a war.<br/><br/>The last story is the conclusion to ""That Yellow Bastard."" Hartigan has been sent to prison and is blamed for kidnapping and molesting Nancy. The two develop a friendship and begin sending each other friendly messages. Eight years later he receives a letter with a finger inside which he believes to be Nancy. He gives the court what they want and gets out of jail. His priority is to find Nancy and save her. When he does find her, however, she's fine. (At this point she is played sexily by Jessica Alba) It's at this point when we realize it was all a trap to lead ""someone"" to her. He must get her to safety before something happens.<br/><br/>The whole movie is well made. It has an all star cast, a great director, and a great screenplay. We all know Robert Rodriguez for his great movies (I.E El Mariachi, Desperado, and Once Upon a Time In Mexico) and his dumb but fun movies (From Dusk till Dawn, The Faculty, and the Spy Kids Series) but I believe this is one of his better film and is absolutely a must see. You will not be bored nor disappointed.<br/><br/>Sin City 10/10"
"wconnall","2","1","3","24 February 2007"," Only good if you like comics or graphic novels
","Hey, don't get me wrong. I like some graphic novels and comic books. But this movie was seriously lacking and disturbing at the same time. I'll start with the worst part: the plot. Actually, there was no plot. I was reminded of the original Heavy Metal. A bunch of mini-movies loosely held together by a ball--that's right--see the movie to understand. Sin City was a string of stories that played on current fantasies of hot women running around with swords. The action was raw and the graphic parts were really graphic. Two people, a man and woman, get their jollies in a sexual way from killing. This crosses the ""sick"" line for me. I'm sure this is part of the great appeal that it has for the people who like the movie. BUT, if we step back for a minute, and look at the movie from a more objective standpoint, I think we will see it fail as a full-length feature film. The lack of plot and the graphicness for graphicness sake will eventually (in a few years when the ""novelness"" of the movie wears off) will sink this movie well below the top 100 movies of all time and put it where it should be--an interesting movie that has an avid cult following like Wizards or Heavy Metal."

","Sideways. Batman Begins. Brokeback Mountain. Three of 2005's best film. Another movie that should be entered into that list is Sin City, a brilliantly acted, exciting comic book noir action thriller starring an all-star cast lead by Clive Owen, Mickey Rourke and Bruce Willis. The film is directed by Frank Miller (the author of the Graphic Novels on which Sin City is based) and Robert Rodriguez (El Mariachi, Desperado) and even has a scene directed by Quentin Tarantino.<br/><br/>Although the good guys are a bunch of lowlifes and cutthroats you can't help but cheer them on, while the villains are some of the most evil and horrible characters ever to grace the silver screen. The ever brilliant Clive Owen excels as Dwight, Bruce Willis shows that he hasn't lost any of his super coolness as ex-cop Hartigan and Academy Award winner Benicio Del Toro (Best Actor in a Supporting Role 2000- Traffic) is wonderfully creepy as perverted cop Jackie Boy. But it's Mickey Rourke who steels the show as relentless ex-con Marv who is out for revenge on Elijah Wood's (Lord of the Ring's Frodo) cannibal Kevin after he murdered his one true love, Goldie (Pearl Harbor's Jaime King).<br/><br/>Rodriguez' idea to make the film in the format of a comic book and not as a normal film and shoot it in black and white adds to the atmoshpere and gives the movie a wonderful eerieness. Someone give this man an Oscar. In conclusion, it may be Spiderman who is raking in the big bucks, but it is Sin City that will not only remain the ultimate comic book movie but also become an all-time classic."

"lazyrite","2","1","3","21 January 2007"," is anyone else not in love with the visuals?
","to be fair, let me preface by saying that i have never read the original Frank Miller graphic novel, and so am 'uneducated' in some respects. i am also an unremitting lover of the look of actual grain and celluloid film, even if digital video and CG graphics are getting better and better. Many other reviewers unenamored of the film have talked about how the cinematic medium, even when trying to exactly replicate the comic, has a totally different psychological/emotional effect than a still 'snapshot' story that allows the reader to create their own tones, pace, and nuances; likewise, i would like to argue that the visual grit of the compressed 2-D, graphic novel medium is also lost when translated to a semi-3-D, digitally filmed medium. the framing, the lighting, the color effects were all very pretty, but it lacked the TEXTURE, the true grit the brain fills in when looking at the varying lines in a comic, or when looking at earlier noir movies filmed with actual props and locations rather than post-green screen CG. What it really reminded me of was that Gatorade commercial filmed in stark black and white punctuated by the athlete's lime green sweat. i'm not saying it looked bad, it's still 100 times more visually engaging than any of the muddled, busy, artless stuff excreted by George Lucas in his latter-day techno-infatuation, but my eye became desperate for real texture, and got bored pretty quickly.<br/><br/>a film ain't looks alone, and i found the rest to be over-slick and flat as well. The 'hard-boiled' delivery of lines was conceptually clever for the first minute, and then got really grating and monotonous. i'm sure that if i were to read Frank Miller's graphic novel, the character nuance and the re-invention of the old noir-comic archetype heroes, villains, and dames would be apparent. But the characters in the film never develop past the straight-jacket of the archetype, and hyper-cliché is still cliché. The usual joy of modern graphic novels or a Tarantino or Rodriguez flick is being able to watch recognized genre archetypes being reinvented and derailed, being able to watch the larger than life heist-member, hit man, or she-assassin mull over real world inanities of french fast food, the meaning of Madonna lyrics, or unclogging the toilet in the bar bathroom. the fast pace of the story and hyper-action were mildly entertaining, but i found myself checking my watch.<br/><br/>wow, this turned out to be a long-winded reiteration of what a lot of other people have said already, when i really just wanted to say that it looked like that gatorade commercial. damn, now i'm thirsty."

With special computer effects you can do anything you want. In this case bring a comic to life. Funny thing is they turn it into a film that looks like a comic anyway, I don't know why, because its cool is not a good answer at all, there is got to be a point. You can find anything if you walk down the right back alley of Sin City, Welcome! This town beckons with the tough, the corrupt, the broken-hearted, some call it dark or hard-boiled, others call it home. Crooked cops, sexy dames and desperados. Some are seeking revenge, others lust after Redemption. And there are those few hoping for a little of both. A universe of unlikely and reluctant heros trying to do the right thing in a world that refuses to care. Shocking stories and suspenseful with verve and invention.

Aside from the lack of swearing,the film was also different in the sense that it had no color except on emphasised objects(I think thats it) I found this to be very effective and different. Aside from this the film was shot in High-definition film(correct me if i am wrong)so as to bring out fine details not seen in other films.

","I was reluctant when I rented this movie because I had heard from several people it was terrible. But, it was guest directed by Quentin Tarantino. I then sat in my basement and for two straight hours was blown away.<br/><br/>It's hard to describe the plot of Sin City; it is three self contained stories that overlap ever so slightly in a bar scene. The first stars Mickey Rourke as Marv as he goes on a killing rampage to find the man who killed a hooker he'd been with the night before. The second stars Clive Owen as Dwight and Benicio Del Toro as Jackie Boy. In this segment Dwight has to stop the mob from getting possession of a cop's head in order to stop a outright civil war in Sin City. The third stars Bruce Willis as Hartigan and Jessica Alba as the illustrious Nancy Callahan; this story is about a child molester who terrorizes Nancy.<br/><br/>Sin City is one of the most unrelenting, non-stop, action movies I've ever seen. In essence it's noir at the top of it's game. The movie is a thrill ride from start to finish. The movie's a blood bath that looks at itself and has the audacity to laugh. The characters treat these outrageous situations with a dark sense of humor and twisted nobility. What the film does very well is blend realism with impossibility, for example, in Sin City it's impossible to kill someone. In one sequence a man gets hit by a car several times and walks away unscathed.<br/><br/>The movie is outrageous, unrelenting and just a lot of fun to watch. Shown in stylistic black and white, people will either love it or hate it. I, personally, find it to be one of the best films of the 21st century."
"strangla35","10","1","3","25 June 2006"," Visually glamorous and beautifully crafted...
","Sin City is a film that is a mix-mesh of comic book fantasy realm, sharp, striking noir-esquire settings and format, and pure adrenal action that all runs together perfectly. Based on the ""Sin City"" graphic novel series by Frank Miller, the film stays amazingly faithful to the source material, while at the same time exercising the freedom to break from the confines of the graphic novel frames and become a movie that stands out from the rest. The film, shot in color and then converted to seductive hi-definition black-and-white (mixed with many objects and settings of glorious colors that jump out from the screen), has a dark, noirish feeling the whole way through and never fails to satisfy. It takes you deep into the psychological wastelands of it's three main characters: Marv (a big, Frankenstein-type guy who's Hell-bent on vengeance), Dwight (a guy with good intentions who is trying to protect a gaggle of prostitutes from enemies ranging from corrupt cops to mob bosses), and Hartigan (an old on-the-verge-of-retirement cop with a heart condition who will do anything to protect an innocent girl from a rapist pedophile, who happens to be the son of a very corrupt senator). The story's characters appear and fall out of each other's lives, much like a Pulp Fiction-type movie. The action and excessive violence, while quite often far-fetched, serves as a nice tool to keep the movie in a fantasy/comic book setting. The dialogue, while not usually top-notch (and on a few conditions a tad cheesy) is delivered well, albeit with a little too much melodrama. Still, the acting is well-done, no actor seems out of place with their character. Perhaps the best thing about Sin City, though, is the fact that, unlike other comic book-movie adaptations, it is not really a comic book-turned-movie; rather, it is more a comic book that, while put on-screen and into the format of a movie, still has the feeling like a comic book the whole way through, even though it has broken past the confines of the graphic novel pages. And is it re-playable? I gotta tell ya, after this movie ended, I wanted to just start it right over and watch it again."
"viske","5","1","3","25 May 2006"," Original filming, not a great story
","This film is original, quite violent and shows lot's of great camera and film making work. It is alternative, but not in a European way; a mysterious comic book with somewhat a clumsy story weaving line.<br/><br/>Definitely worth watching if you are the ultimate action movie aficionado and if you are into ""special"" movie making styles, rated R.<br/><br/>Nail biting and packed with quite the cast, the film is atypical in every way and feels more cult than culture, with it's own fan club and voted high in the ranks of ""action"" whilst not seeking to qualify for the ""typical"" action movie.<br/><br/>Some of the stars show totally different sides of their talent; Rourke and Wood's performances are definitely unique. <br/><br/>The story is not great; the film is mostly in black and white. Make sure to get into the right mindset before watching."

","A lot of movies have been made in attempt to bring comic books to life...Sin City not only set the bar higher, but have basically given Frank Miller's Sin City graphic novels a living, breathing, incarnate. Shot almost completely in green screen, Rodriguez was able to basically place the cast into the comic book and let the action explode from the page. Clever, sparing use of color add to the masterful visuals that make this movie eye candy that I never get tired of watching. The dialogue does not leave much room for interpretation, but the engaging aspect of the plot lines is in the characters' role as pieces of the puzzle in the makeup of Sin City, and how our ""heroes"" try to rise above the evil that lies within."
"Furious_Fenner","9","1","3","2 April 2006"," What a film!
","WOW! What a film. Every now and then, a film comes along that you HAVE to see, even if you end up hating it. Films like Fight Club, Se7en, The Usual Suspects and so on. Strangely, often these films turn out to be my favourite. Needless to say, Sin City is now one of my favourite films. Sure, it's hammy, sexist, explicit and hideously violent, but it's also gripping, exciting and so much more. I can't really explain why I like it so much. I just do. Brilliant.<br/><br/>Mickey Rourke is great and almost unrecognisable (correction: totally unrecognisable), but the other 'main men' Bruce Willis and Clive Owen are hammier than a butchers shop. Jessica Alba, despite being gorgeous, has nothing to get her teeth into either, so acting isn't the films strong point in general. <br/><br/>Thats about all I can say.<br/><br/>Bit where Elijah Wood gets eaten by his dog is strangely less shocking then you would expect, I'm not sure why..."

","This is quite honestly the best film to have come out the cinema in about two or three years, perhaps more.<br/><br/>When i watched the first scene, my jaw just dropped, i couldn't believe it.

Rodriguez, has breathed life into westerns, children's films, vampire films, and now, comic books.<br/><br/>lets face it, no comic books that have been made into films have ever been good have they? take x-men or hellboy. good, to a certain perspective, but Sin City isn't afraid of doing what the comics say. It is so true to the book, it is unbelievable. It is not scared to do what it wants. As Robert Rodriguez said 'I don't want to make Robert Rodriguez sin city, i wanted to make Frank Millers Sin City' Quite honestly my joint favourite film, along with Goodfellas Its honestly that good."
"cherold","7","1","3","12 February 2006"," Stylish, if not much else
","For pure visual presentation, Sin City is certainly one of the greatest movies ever made. It does a beautiful job of brining a nourish comic book sensibility to life, with a fascinating use of color.<br/><br/>And at first that and the movie's sense of degenerate cool is enough. As cop Bruce Willis goes after a psycho killer, the wit and the grit create a fascinating heightened version of film noir. I spent much of the movie wondering how one would describe it. It's not film noir, because it's so excessive, but while it is excess to the point of parody, it's not comical, and often the over-the-top grimness work.<br/><br/>Because it is so over-the-top, the movie can slip into stupidity and a simplistic view of the world that is in many ways the antithesis of classic film noir. The film shows its worst is a sequence involving the prostitutes of old town, which with its Irish mercenaries and Kill Bill-styled assassins is just plain silly. And the movie tends to wear on you, because it's pretty much the same thing over and over.<br/><br/>Still, it's high-cinematic cool pushes the rating from a 5 to a 7."
"mindstar","4","1","3","13 December 2005"," Mediocre
","This is a very uneven film- essentially it has three story segments. One features nearly indestrucible man-mountain Marv (brilliantly played by Mickey Rourke) on a mission of vengeance, one features Bruce Willis in a boring performance and one apparently features Clive Owen, though you would be hard pressed to notice him- as his performance simply fades away, absorbed into the general headache of it all. The problem is that on paper, the stories work well. But when you transpose them onto film, the sickening violence and blatant misogyny take their toll on the viewer. The film really is all style over substance. There is one good segment- Mickey Rourke's Marv is both cynically funny and engaging, his ability to escape death entertaining and this segment features cameos from Elijah Wood and Rutger Hauer. My advice would be to watch Rourke's segment and then stop. Life is to short and too precious to spend it watching a dreary succession of violent stabbings and shootings."

"Boba_Fett1138","10","1","3","4 December 2005"," Gives 'movie violence' a new meaning.
","Out of all the in 2005 released movies I have seen so far, this one takes the cake. It's renewing, stylish and just simply overall brilliantly made. It really is a breath of fresh air. This movie sets (or should set) the new standards for film-noir for the 21th century. It's straight to the point, very direct, dark and violent but yet all done with lots of flair and style. I really do hope more movies in this sort of 21th century film-noir style will be made, in the near or distant future.<br/><br/>I didn't wanted this movie to stop! I truly enjoyed every second of it. I have to admit that at first I had to get used to the unusual style of movie-making but once I was accustomed to it I didn't wanted it to stop. The first few minutes of the movie with Josh Hartnett and Marley Shelton perfectly works as an introduction to the movie and its style. This movie is unlike anything else you've experienced before. The style perfectly captures the Frank Miller's comic book feelings. It flawlessly captures some of those typical comic book moments and its atmosphere.<br/><br/>The movie is ultra-violent and features lots of bullets, other weapons and limbs flying around. The movie its essence is not on the story but truly on the violence in it. The violence is done in such an over-the-top way that it isn't 'shocking' in terms of sickening. It's done with style and lots of dark-humor and that's why it should be perfectly watchable for everyone. It really gives 'movie violence' a new meaning.<br/><br/>The movie features a few actors that truly surprised me. First of all it is great to see that Mickey Rourke is really back again. He is perfect as Marv and perhaps plays the best character of the entire movie. Actors that mainly surprised me were; Clive Owen and Elijah Wood. Clive Owen is a great actor but I always thought he also was very boring and had little charisma. Granted that that gave him a certain coolness in movies but in ""Sin City"" he is cool, cool and not boring cool (hope that made a bit sense to you). He suits his role perfectly and is really awesome to watch. And who would had ever known that that sweet little looking Elijah Wood was able to play a convincing and genuine scary psychophysic serial killer/cannibal. The entire movie is filled with well known actors but all of them are cast to suite their role and not in the first place because of their well known names. Some of the big names in this movie are; Nick Stahl, Brittany Murphy, Michael Madsen, Jaime King, Rick Gomez, Rosario Dawson, Powers Boothe, Michael Clarke Duncan, Jessica Alba, Rutger Hauer, Josh Hartnett, Benicio Del Toro..should I really go on? All of the characters are cool and unique in their very special own way. The movie mainly consists out of three separate stories set in Sin City. Three main characters in those stories are being played by Bruce Willis, Mickey Rourke and Clive Owen. The movie also features some strong female characters. They might look cute and sexy but you better not mess with them!<br/><br/>Robert Rodriguez delivers with this movie a brilliant new sort and daring movie that is made with an incredible amount of style. The use of black and white and the use of some colors in some scene's works great for the movie and its special kind of atmosphere. It makes ""Sin City"" a certainly unique but also definitely awesome movie to watch. Besides directing Robert Rodrigueze also once again does his own cinematography, editing, sound re-recording mixing, visual effects and the musical score for the movie, along with respected composers John Debney and Graeme Revell. You really have to respect Rodriguez how he makes movies and what he achieve's with it and how it also appeals to a wide range of audience, even though his movies are often unique and something new that hasn't been done and shown before.<br/><br/>Finally a movie again, that lives up to the hype. Looking extremely forward to the new Sin City movies, I simply can not get enough of it!<br/><br/>10/10<br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"
"domino1003","10","1","3","29 November 2005"," Nasty Noir
","Frank Miller's ""Sin City"" is a series of graphic novels which revolves around the inhabitants of Basin City, a cold and murky city in which law and order barely exists, and violence is an acceptable way of life.<br/><br/>Under the direction of Robert Rodriguez (With Miller and ""Special Guest"" Quentin Tarrantino on board as well), ""Sin City"" has been perfectly adapted from page to screen, with a cast of actors that amaze as much as the colors and scenery.<br/><br/>There are 3 stories in the film, but each one connected in its own way.<br/><br/>1) This story, which is the longest of the 3, centers around Marv (Mickey Rourke), a not-so-handsome brute whose fling with a woman named Goldie (Jaime King)ends with her winding up dead and Marv on a bloody path to vengeance, which leads to (Kevin) Elijah Wood, a silent-but-deadly guy that has a peculiar diet.<br/><br/>2)Dwight (Clive Owen)helps the ladies of Sin City when a hero cop he accidentally bumps off (Benicio Del Toro)becomes more trouble dead than alive. With the help of Gail (Rosario Dawson)and Miho (Devon Aoki), Dwight has to fight the gangsters that want to take over the ladies' territory, Manute (Michael Clarke Duncan)in particular.<br/><br/>3)Hartigan (Bruce Willis)is a soon-to-retire cop (Heart problems)that is determined to solve a case involving Roark Jr. (Nick Stahl), the insane son of Senator Roark (Powers Boothe), a corrupt politician. Hartigan saves a little girl named Nancy from him, but his career is destroyed in the process. Roark Sr., bent on revenge, makes sure that Hartigan is imprisoned for crimes he didn't commit. Hartigan, knowing that Nancy will be killed if he reveals the truth, stays silent. When he is released, he must save Nancy (Jessica Alba) from Yellow Bastard, who is determined to make Nancy scream.<br/><br/>The film is a nasty bit of noir: deep and rough narrations,incredibly brutal violence, sexy women that can hold their own against anyone,and bare flesh. Although the film is black and white, there are scenes where color seems to burst through, practically glowing.<br/><br/>This is not a good one for the kids, so you might want to avoid letting them see this"
"ded_meet","3","1","3","21 November 2005"," Incoherent, weird - and beautiful...
","First of all I must say that the movie was very well made in almost every way. Really. Great shots, even greater actors and a nice ""feel"" to it. They've managed to capture that ""comicbook-world"" feeling in the movie which must be very difficult.<br/><br/>So why didn't I like it?<br/><br/>I don't like the way they tell the story - following several main characters and their backgrounds independently in short episodes. They provide a great way of presenting the ""world"" in which the story takes place (the metropolis) - but why? In my opinion the story is very ""character-oriented"". It revolves around a small group of people and how their lives interact. The ""background-world"" itself is pretty much irrelevant for the story, yet still much of the movie is focused on presenting it - on portraying it. In the end it just makes the movie seem somewhat incoherent and weird. But well made... Perhaps like a beautiful melody played in an unfamiliar rhythm, using only the black keys on the piano? =)<br/><br/>You should see it and make your own mind up."
"Enchorde","7","1","3","7 November 2005"," Pure violence
","Recap: A few loosely connected stories that takes place in the fictional story of Sin City. Based on the graphic novel by Frank Miller. The stories generally tell the story of a lone man that has fallen outside the system. The law is not functioning, and to protect and avenge the girl of theirs, and get even, they go on a personal crusade through the city, to find out who is responsible for the injustice done to them. And they are not asking nice.<br/><br/>Comments: This is two hours of pure violence. The heroes can take and dish out enormous amount of damage, and they do on a nightly basis. Indeed the movie is so full of action violence, clearly resembling that what one expects in a graphic novel, that the story is forced to take the back seat. In my opinion, the movie would have been better if there would have been a stronger, more emphasized story. But still the move is very entertaining. As I believe director Rodriguez said, this is an translation of the graphic novel to the medium of a movie, not an adaptation. So the very brutal violence is given a clear aspect of that in a graphic novel. Indeed, the total experience is the one of having been shown a graphic novel, and if that was the intention, the movie is very successful. This means, for instance, that the violence is very brutal and unrealistic, so it is never scary or nasty. Actually just fun and entertaining.<br/><br/>The visual concept of the movie is very interesting, mostly being black and white, but with a few exceptions. Red is a returning color, as is the eyecolor blue. Blood is red sometimes, and white other times. This gives the movie a unique visual feel, which is very interesting. But it never bothers with the story of the movie.<br/><br/>Since there is three almost independent stories the cast is big, and there are lot of big names. Some get more time on the screen than others, but a in general it is very good acting. I really like Rourke's performance as Marv. Good casting, good acting.<br/><br/>I'll give this move a 7 out of 10. It was very entertaining, but if the movie wishes to score higher with me, I need a better story."
"jaynobody","10","1","3","6 November 2005"," Awesome!
","All I can say about this movie is ""wow"". The style just blew me away, never has a movie come so close to emulating a comic book as this one. The mostly black and white film has splashes of color that just add to the mood. Its like a modern film noir. I am not a big fan of CGI effects in general, but this movie seems made for them.<br/><br/>Some people have dismissed the characters as underdeveloped, but is that not the point of the film? These aren't supposed to be real characters, they are comic book characters, they are almost arch types.<br/><br/>The thin line between right and wrong the ""good guys"" in this film walk is never far from the surface, but in Sin City you can torture people and still be a ""good guy"". The men in this film are all violent, the women are mostly one dimensional sex objects. Thats the world they inhabit, and the women in this film are certainly not weak. In fact they kick more butt then any man. Many people can't get by the fact that this film takes place in a stylized world that exists in the fantasy of many young boys. Tough guys, sexy women, and lots of violence. The action in this film is fast, and super violent. Standout performances from Benico Del Toro, Mickey Rouke, Bruce Willis, and Jessica Alba."
"goldbenji","10","1","3","4 November 2005"," A breath of fresh air
","Sin City is a fresh film. Most action for the past five years has been hugely lacking in depth, style and originality. I think sin city holds all these factors. The visual depths of the film are astonishing, Rodriguez has managed to perfectly portray the pages of Sin City into the a movie. More importantly than being a great action film, it is by far the best comic/graphic novel movie so far. Spiderman and x-men were good films, but all relied on over the top action sequences involving tornadoes etc. whilst sin city uses far more stylised and decisive action. More importantly, it sticks to the pages of the books. The plot is multi-strand allowing for the audience to keep interest and the characters, most the acting and of course our favourite Jessica Alba all contribute to making the film such a success."
"robuff","10","1","3","3 November 2005"," On My Top Ten List
","There are several movies I watch again and again. Sin City will be one of them. There is just too much in this movie to see unless you watch it many times. I love the use of the old cars like Hartigan's '55 Buick, Nancy's '57 Chevy, and the Dwight's '59 Caddy convertible. The black and white with splashes of color capture the comic book feel.<br/><br/>Many of the lines will become ""quoteables"" for years to come much like Dirty Harry's ""Do you want to make my day?"" except it will be ""And after I pull off that miracle, maybe I'll go punch out God."" or ""You made a big mistake yourself... you didn't flush.""<br/><br/>The time sequence is very unique and about as complex as ""The Clearing"" (Robert Redford & Willem Dafoe). I still haven't made the connection with opening scene (The Salesman) and the middle of the movie. Hartigan and Nancy are part of the main thread and the others tie together in the bar."
"paltry_dragon","9","1","3","3 November 2005"," Fantastic movie, I love it so much~~~~
","beautiful pix ,amazing story , perfect action....<br/><br/>With Hellboy, Guillermo Del Toro lovingly recreated panels from artist/creator Mike Mignola's comic book stories and brought them to vibrant life, setting a new benchmark for adaptations that respect their source material. With Sin City, however, co-directors Robert Rodriguez and Frank Miller have done more than just recreate the brutal chiaroscuro of Miller's stark post-modern noir artwork, they've captured the essence and the aesthetic of Basin City (as much a character as Marv or Hartigan) and brought its universe and characters to a stunning three-dimensional life. And unlike Hellboy, which suffered from a weak, confusing script, Sin City weaves a Pulp Fiction-esquire narrative which snakes through the dark streets and crooked alleyways of this hellish metropolis like a fever dream.<br/><br/>In short, Sin City delivers a blistering ballet of bullets and blood, dames and danger at every turn. It's a kinetic masterpiece of pop culture for the new millennium (and a case could be made that this was the movie that CGI was invented for)."

","Sin City is something that truly should not be missed. From the unbelievable contrast in visual style, to the thrilling action packed ride that it is, this is the best movie this man has ever seen.<br/><br/>Each of the three chapters in Sin City are magnificent. The story telling is unmatched, the narration comes in at the perfect moments, and everything is timed perfectly. Thought the stories vaguely connect, it doesn't really make much of a difference. If each chapter were a separate movie, I would have loved it just the same.<br/><br/>The dark and ""sinful"" atmosphere in the film are worked to perfection. All the main characters voice act perfectly, showing little emotion which conveys the theme perfectly. The movie is always spot on when it comes to action too. There is just the right amount of suspense and thrills and the visual style only adds to it. The characters, major and minor, all have a certain aura of mystery behind them, giving each confrontation that additional kick of excitement.<br/><br/>I could ramble on all day on how great this movie is, but I will just it simply that this movie is a work of art. The movie itself would be fun to watch with no dialog, that is how good it looks. And the story line is truly top notch. Easily gets my vote for movie of the year. GO SEE IT NOW! 10/10"

","When the film started, I knew that I would be drawn to it. As what I expected, the movie brought me new feeling about this kind of movie that adapted from cartoon. The using of black and white made me feel like watching a real cartoon. The story happened in the dark city was unpleasant and depressing. The violence was everywhere. But justice still existed. That was comfortable, though the ending part was sad and touching.<br/><br/>If the movie was shot in color, the feeling will be totally different. Maybe I will not be so interested. There are partial colors to emphasize something for example the blood is red. The success of the movie should be attributed to the amazing cinematography.<br/><br/>One of the best adapted cartoon movies. 8/10"

","Frank Miller and Robert Rodriguez, what a combination. This is one the best comic book adaptations I have ever seen. It falls right in line with Richard Donner's Superman and Tim Burton's Batman 1 & 2. The film itself is simply just amazing. The look of it really gives it that comic book feel. The cast is perfect, Bruce Willis, Mickey Rourke, and Clive Owen are great as the three main leads. When you see the movie and read through one of the sin city graphic novels it looks like the pages were literally ripped from the book an put into the movie. Being a comic book fan myself i can truly say that Rodrique stayed true to the material. The movie was recently released on DVD I suggest that everyone goes out and rent it. Also if you can't wait for the sequel go out and read the sin city graphic novels. This movie was fantastic 10 out of 10!"

","In my opinion, Sin City is great. It's Robert Rodriguez's best movie. This black and white movie is an action movie, but it looks as a comic, as Frank Miller's Sin City. There are three chapters: Marv (Mickey Rourke) is a guy who has passed the best night of his life with a woman called Goldie. AT the morning, she's dead. He'll look for the killer, a crazy man and, then, a priest. Hartigan is going to leave the police. But he does a last thing: he saves Nancy Callahan, a 11 aged girl who is going to be killed by the son of a senator. he saves her, but he'll go to jail during eight years. He'll discover then the love of Nancy, who's now nineteen. Dwight kills Jackie Boy in Old Town (bitches town). Jackie Boy is crazy, nut he's a policeman. Then there'll be a war between the bitches and other people through the control of Old Town.<br/><br/>It's a bit violent, but Sin City is a good film. I also recommend The Killer (1989) directed by John Woo."

"TxMike","Null","1","3","29 August 2005"," Black and white, with selective color, a great looking movie.
","""Sin City"" is the latest movie where a comic book comes alive. In the hands of Rodriguez the result is spectacular. Many will be turned off by the story and the extreme amount of violence, even though as viewers we know it is ""pretend"" violence, the kind you see in comic books where a bullet-riddled man continues to live, or a single gunshot removes an ear or a hand. But being able to watch through that rewards one with the images and ""filming"" style used here. (No film was actually used, digital images were.) <br/><br/>The movie is mostly in black and white, but in the opening scene we see a beautiful girl in a bright red dress, and with very red lips. Throughout the movie, there are very select images in color. A red car, a woman's very blue eyes, alternating blue, red, green shades of light on the face of a driver. And, of course, the very yellow man. It all works very well. Filmed in and around Austin, Texas where Rodriguez lives, much of the action was shot in green rooms with digital background added in post production. In a style very similar to ""Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow.""<br/><br/>The movie has an all-star cast, but some of the more memorable -- Benicio Del Toro as the bad guy, Jackie Boy, Carla Gugino as the beautiful parole officer Lucille, Mickey Rourke in heavy makeup as Marv, looking for his girl's killer, and Bruce Willis as Hartigan, the retiring cop with a bad ticker, out to find and protect Nancy, played as an adult by Jessica Alba."
"brainofj72","9","1","3","27 August 2005"," A Brilliant Modern Noir
","There has certainly been no shortage of comic book movies lately. From ""Spider-Man"" to ""X-Men"", for one reason or another, it just seems to be the current craze. Most of the films in this group are nothing but pointless Hollywood garbage full of drawn-out action sequences and cheesy dialogue. However, there are those select few that stand out. ""Sin City"" is one film does just about everything but get lost in the crowd.<br/><br/>The film, based on the graphic novels by Frank Miller, follows three stories. One is about Hartigan (Willis), a cop with a ""bum ticker"" on the verge of retirement who rescues a little girl from a rapist with political ties (Stahl); one is about Marv (Rourke), an odd-looking man searching for the killer of his ""true love"", Goldie (King), a prostitute who slept with him and ""was nice to him"" - something no other woman had ever done; and the other is about Dwight (Owen), a man who aids a group of prostitutes in the murder of several men, one of whom turns out to be a cop, which sends Old Town (a city run by prostitutes) into a war. And this is all tied together by several elements, including a prostitute waitress (Murphy) and a cannibalistic serial killer (Wood).<br/><br/>By now you've probably realized that ""Sin City"" isn't exactly a cookie-cutter PG-13 comic book movie, due to all the prostitutes, murder, and what-not. In fact, it's a violent pop-culture celebration, featuring one of the most remarkable casts in ages and being directed by Robert Rodriguez, Quentin Tarantino, and Frank Miller himself.<br/><br/>The film's visual element is undeniably fantastic, as it remains strikingly faithful to Miller's graphic novels. Using a gorgeous mix of black and white and strategically placed color, the film creates an atmosphere reminiscent of the classic noir films of the '30s and '40s while still maintaining a distinctly modern feel, and also moves at a deliberate pace, as it is loaded with snappy dialogue, clever editing, and over-the-top violence.<br/><br/>The film's only real flaw is its hit-and-miss acting, but I guess this may have been done somewhat on purpose, perhaps to further enforce the comic book element? Maybe, but I doubt it.<br/><br/>But that aside, ""Sin City"" is a truly great, original film that screams for numerous sequels, as it seems like it just has so much more to show us. It almost feels like this film is just an appetizer. Let's hope Rodriguez doesn't destroy the sequels to this wonderful instant classic, which is arguably the best comic book-to-film adaptation ever made.<br/><br/>9/10"

Everything about this movie I love, from the technical aspects, to the characters, to each of the stories, (The movie is actually three stories with two shorts to open and close it) I bought this DVD and I have watched it for almost a week straight and I cannot get enough of it. It is so far the best movie of the year-in my opinion- and the first movie of this year that has left me breathless (I will admit I have not seen Crash yet and people say that was superb) What we see on screen is a comic book brought to life. Robert Rodriquez used the actual comic books by Frank Miller for storyboards. On the credits he says he shot and cut the movie there is no writing credits, he just pulled the movie from the pages of the comic books.<br/><br/>Is this movie violent? Yes. But you could not have it any other way. The name of the movie is Sin City and the comic books are dark and violent and to do this movie any other way would not give the comic books justice. I have not read any of the comic books but I plan on buying the ones that the movie was based off of.<br/><br/>See this, enjoy it, become a part of the world.<br/><br/>A word of warning...it can be very graphic and it crosses a few borders such as the scene where That Yellow Bastard whips Nancy Callahan, but that is what it was made to do.

"ricky_roma1","8","1","3","22 August 2005"," Mickey Rourke 'is' Marv
","When I first heard there was going to be an adaptation of Frank Miller's Sin City, I went to my local Borders and picked up both 'The Hard Goodbye' and 'That Yellow Bastard'. I read them and was thinking to myself, 'How can they possibly make this into a movie'? It was violent, daring, and offensive. However, I thought the novels were sensational ('sin'-sational?). Sensations of adrenaline and excitement came from reading the novels. I thought it was because of the film noir qualities, of men in trouble and femme fatales with secrets and violent inclinations. On subsequent readings, I came to realize it was because of the characters (though it was more likely a combination of the two). Not admirable, yet very human characters roaming through the back alleys of Old Town. My favorite characters in the novels I read were Junior/Yellow Bastard (what evil), and the dumb, brutish, totally cool Marv. When I read the novels, they had yet to begin casting any of the major parts. I think they already had Josh Hartnett and Bruce Willis, but no others. So when I was reading, I kept wondering who would be able to harness the raw violence and possible insanity of Marv. When Mickey Rourke was cast, I was a little disappointed, because he hadn't been in any pictures recently and I never really thought of him as a very strong performer. Then, on April 1, I saw Sin City and was blown away by Mickey's performance. As Frank Miller told Robert Rodriguez, Mickey Rourke was Marv. His performance, though unlikely, should garner some sort of acclaim. Golden Globes, maybe? Certainly the Academy wouldn't laud Mickey Rourke for being in a comic book adaptation. They'll ignore Sin City for the acting and focus on the technical bravado, and I think that's a shame, because Rourke really was good in this film. That's all."

","I have been anxious to see this film since I first saw the trailer for it early in March and so I finally got to rent the movie since it came out a couple days ago in stores. This movie is fantastic. The actors are all amazing even the ones who had very small roles. They still did an incredible job. Clive Owen as Dwight and Mickey Rourke as Marv were my favorite characters and their stories are incredible to watch. The script as well is mesmerizing and all the character's lines were superb. The music was very good too and the soft piano playing went well with the movie. But what was my favorite of the whole movie was the excellent black and white picture with some small color images. Sin City's black and white picture is awesome and the color images like Dwight's red car, the red blood, the woman's green eyes, and the yellow bastard is really cool to look at. Overall, an incredible and original film that will sure be a classic. So far, the best film of 2005, in my opinion. I highly recommend it.<br/><br/>Hedeen's Outlook: 10/10 **** A+"
"suspiria10","9","1","3","21 August 2005"," S10 Reviews: Sin City (2005)
","Frank Miller's celebrated noir comic series makes a stunning leap to the big screen. This stylized adaptation contains three stories (four if you count the wraparound featuring ""The Man"") that intertwine in many ways. First tale involves a cop (Bruce Willis) on the eve of retirement. His last assignment follows the trail of a11-year-old who was kidnapped and possibly murdered by a sadistic child molester who happens to be a senator's son. The second tale (and the best) features Marv (Mickey Rourke, hands down the best role of his career) on the hunt for a silent killer who took out Goldie (Jaime King) a kin-natured prostitute who showed poor stone-faced Marv a good time. There will be hell to pay and Marv will settle the score. The third and final tale concerns Dwight (Clive Owen) a thug with a new face who is set on reclaiming his woman and will put the hurt on the joker who had put the beating on her. That story winds down in a prostitute town that cleans up their messes and solve their own problems through the brute force of Miho (Devon Aoki).<br/><br/>""Sin City"" is possibly the most faithful comic adaptation that you'll see. The film is quite literally a comic panel come to life. The stark black and white photography (with bits of color) perfectly captures in vivid detail the world of ""Sin City"". Every aspect of the film is near perfection from the strong musical score to the editing (which seamlessly jumps around the tales but never leaves you in the dark) and the cast. Wow the cast is phenomenal I mean we've got Bruce Willis, Mickey Rourke, Jessica Alba, Powers Boothe, Rosario Dawson, Benicio Del Toro, Michael Clarke Duncan, Carla Gugino, Clive Owen to just name a few. I've read many of a review criticizing the actors but I felt they all do a bang up job as their respective characters. ""Sin City"" is simply amazing."
"Shnu","8","1","3","30 July 2005"," Wow
","With loads of star names in the titles and the amount of publicity that this film has received some might be worried that it doesn't live up to expectations. But with amazing performances from every part, original story lines and unique choice of screen colour, Sin City's in a class of it's own.<br/><br/>Although brutally violent in some places, it's all relevant to the storyline without going overboard and losing track of the plot.<br/><br/>Not for younger viewers or those who are cautious with violence, Sin City's a must see if you want something original and well made to watch."
"afdiazr","8","1","3","25 July 2005"," 2005 will be remembered as the year of Sin City
","What can I say? Beautiful film. Those who can't see art in the form of comic book language are truly blind idiots. I wasn't a fan of Frank Miller's Sin City novels, I was just a casual reader back in my comic- book buying days, but I clearly remember a lot of panels and moments that I read, and still have them fresh in my mind. Having witnessed Robert Rodriguez's Sin City I am just speechless. It's a beautiful film encapsulated in a very violent for a mainstream film package. This is the way this material was to be done. All of the characters are like a trash can where you can reach into and find something beautiful inside. I have these clear images of Marv's story from the comics in my head, and the way it's done here Gee, it's astonishing. Everything's been said about this movie, and I'm thankful Rodriguez could capture all of it's violence and humanity in just two hours. Great indeed."

","Big disappointment.<br/><br/>Thought this movie was the big thing, taken the director and the cast. But it totally sucks. The problem is, that there are to many characters and to many ongoing stories. It never gets exiting. When a scene is slow, it is also boring - in this movie. If you compare it to Kill Bill - you will see the difference. Kill Bill is elegant and entertaining even in the non-action scenes.<br/><br/>It is a disgrace to all Robert Rodriguez fans - he must have needed the money or something. I clearly shows that even though you are a great director you must focus. The idea is great, the cast is great, the looks are great - but the movie is boring as ****"
"Rich B","8","1","3","1 July 2005"," There are some great moments, and superb performances, perhaps just too much style over substance.
","I'd never read any of the graphic novels on which this movie has been based, and I didn't even know anything about the story before hearing about the production, and right from the first trailer it had me. The names, the style, it all looked superb, so I was excited to finally see it at the cinema.<br/><br/>As soon as it opened I was impressed. The visuals and style were superb, and Bruce Willis seemed to be acting his socks off for this role, he suited it so well. However with the good bits came the opening poor performance from Michael Madsen, he hit the audience with a handful of cheese and struggled lines.<br/><br/>It could have been intentional, and the attempt at that old Film Noir style had either resulted in some cheesy performances from those that couldn't produce it effectively, or perhaps it was unintentional. This is something that ran through a couple of the main characters for me. Clive Owen and Madsen were the main problems, in Owen I felt like I was watching Horatio Nelson in an episode of CSI: Miami, say cheesy line and turn off camera while posing, wait for fade.<br/><br/>I was also surprised by Benecio Del Toro, he was passable, but he just didn't hit the mark with his usual performance. Those who without a doubt did steal the show were Willis, Elijah Wood and Mickey Rourke.<br/><br/>Rourke, like Willis, provided a wonderful performance and fitted so well into this genre.They both really portrayed the gritty, hard and embittered characters perfectly and very believably. Those sections of the movie were by far the better and more enjoyable than the others. Wood was a different matter, I've heard many people say he was really good, and he is, he's really effective and creepy, yet how much of that is acting and how much is the style giving that impression? Let's not forget that he ran, jumped and stared, oh and climbed down a stairway.<br/><br/>Something that distracted me from the movie and pulled me out a few times were the connections made between the stories themselves. Some had connections, and others didn't, and whenever I saw one I found myself trying to resolve them and make some form of conclusion from it. Unfortunately there was none, it was just to give some time and location reference, and to be honest neither was needed. For me though, I did find I was pulled out of the story each time, and struggled to think of them as nothing.<br/><br/>The movie is violent, but gets away with a lot because of the style and lack of colour at key moments, and it's this style that makes for a huge portion of what the movie is. It leads me to the question of how successful the follow-up will be, and now that the style is no longer a gimmick, if it will continue to work as a driving factor for the movie. This is something that the Matrix encountered during it's series, and it seriously flagged on the second movie.<br/><br/>There are some great moments, and superb performances from Rourke and Willis. The style that has been captured on screen is nothing short of stunning and quite unique, this has definitely been a huge accomplishment in the adaptation of comics to screen - whoever ends up making The Watchmen please take note - as they've been ever so faithful to the original material. However some truly bad acting and a slightly disjointed feel clouded the movie for me, and it really is the style and the two excellent actors that has kept the score so high."

","Hello I'm a Spanish guy. This movie release in my country when the movie release in DVD in America. But I watched this movie in a pass of distributors. This movie is the best visual adaptation of the comic material ... and the Frank Miller's world. The adaptation of Batman Begins it's OK ... but the essence of the Frank Miller's world I didn't see in Batman Begins ... but in Sin City it's visible in the entire movie. The story and the screenplay it's exactly the same thing that the comic book. The cinematography and the visual effects are perfect for the structure of the comic book ... the visual effects there aren't in this movie for entertain or amuse there are for built the world of sin city. The co-direction of Robert Rodriguez & Frank Miller are amazing, the editing it's energetic and the musical score from Rodriguez & co. it's wonderful for this movie genre. Some of the actors of this movie are excellent: Mickey Rooke, Bruce Willis, Benicio del Toro, Ruther Hauer, Eli Wood, Rosario Dawson & Clive Owen. But there are bad actors witch other movies: Jessica Alba, Brittany Murphy, etc ...<br/><br/>The movie it's great ... the best adaptation from comic material ... I like to see the second movie of this future trilogy."
"rory-74","10","1","3","21 June 2005"," Brilliant
","Quite simply brilliant. From the ultra-stylish cinematography to the remarkable faithfulness to the Frank Miller comics. <br/><br/>I was never a fan of green screen. Until Sin City. I was never a fan of Bruce Willis. Until Sin City. I was never a fan of Clive Owen. Until Sin City.<br/><br/>Rodriguez pulls out unequalled performances from every actor in a film that sets the standards for quality cinema.<br/><br/>Only very momentarily does the script border on pretension but these rare moments are so fleeting they are negated by the many strengths of this film. <br/><br/>Obvious highlights were the Mickey Rourke/Elijah Wood interactions. The pure revulsion of Nick Stahls character in the latter stages of the movie is overwhelming. <br/><br/>I have to say though, it was Clive Owen and his surrounding story that I found the most appealing, and the brief opening/closing appearances of Josh Harshnett oozes class."
"SpookyPie88","10","1","3","20 June 2005"," An Amazing Film
","I don't know where to start when praising this film, everything is perfect. I cant think of one negative thing. Robert Rodriguez has always been my favourite director and this is defiantly his best film so far. He stayed so true to Frank Millers books and as a result the film is completely original, you wouldn't have seen anything like it before.<br/><br/>The look of the film is gorgeous. Extremely glossy and taken straight from the novels it was based on. Filmed in black and white with just a few colours being played on.<br/><br/>The cast was brilliant in this film. Bruce Willis, Mickey Rourke and Clive Owen were brilliant leads. Benicio Del Toro in particular was hysterical as Jackie Boy; he deserves a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for the way he delivered the role. Other worthy mentions are Jessica Alba, Alexis Bledel and Devon Aoki (who probably had the coolest character in the whole film), they were stunning in the film. It was nice to see a cameo from Frank Miller in the film too.<br/><br/>This film is so violent and is breathtaking because of it. Throughout punches are deafening and every sight of blood is accompanied by sickening squelches. At one point someone is smacked in the head with a bar, you hear a hard slam as it does; solid on solid, where it hits the skull, it sounds extremely painful.<br/><br/>The soundtrack is equally outstanding. The music playing over the opening credits is especially gripping, perfect for the film.<br/><br/>I would recommend this film to anyone. It really is perfect. I can see why the content wouldn't appeal to some but go see it anyway for the visual treat."
"livefonos","10","1","3","14 June 2005"," Welcome to Basin City...
","Having been a fan of the Miller era, I often found myself wondering what the fleshing out of the characters would look like on the big screen. And Rodriguez does every imaginative angle, every stitch and threads so much justice I'd swear he was reading my mind. From the blood drinking gladiator Marv, played by the reclusive Mickey Rourke who not since Rumble Fish, has ever held my attention for more than a second. The moment that cinder block of a man hits the screen you're impressed, and dare I say, a little attracted. This is the man every guy dreams of becoming. From Bogart in the ""Maltese Falcon"", to Charles Bronson in ""Death Wish"" nothing ever came as close to portraying the hardest man alive than when Rourke became the one-man killing machine of Marv. His brooding presence's lights up the screen in a way no one else does in the entire movie. And every line he delivers is worth every bloody red cent this movie made him. <br/><br/>Then we have Hartigan played by the ever awe inspiring Bruce Willis. For years his John McClane has been his trump card. Well Hartigan is the grown up version of McClane. A tired worn out cop who does what he does not because He likes itbut because he knows it's the right thing to do. As the urban Lancelot he walks the line, but draws his own. Never have I seen so much depth in Bruce then when he plays the beaten out cop. Every moment of his down fall, every moment he shows his sincerity; every moment he unleashes a battling fury of vengeance you see it, as it would have happened. Bruce does such a magnificent job of capturing that Old rundown caddy that just wont call it quit's. From the opening sequence to the roll of the credits Willis brings back all those Cagney tough guys back on screen.<br/><br/>Then we have Clive Owen. Playing the quieter version of Marv. He's the tough pretty boy who can fight just as good as he looks. His scenes with Del Toro replace all those Travolta and Jackson scenes in Pulp fiction. The chemistry between the two actors is such a thrill to see played out on the big screen, that by the time the actors call it in for the day, your screaming for more. He's the quite reserved introvert in back of the bar trying to keep his nose cleanbut some how trouble always hits him like a grand piano dropped from eight stories up. Dwight is the Nobel knight taking the swing from the green Knights Axesimply because he said he would.<br/><br/>The women are nothing short of impressive either. Rosario Dawson does something I never thought capable. She impressed me. She does magnificent as the Amazon queen of old town Gail. The scantly clad enchantress brings back that old high school kid blush, when you see you favorite teacher show a little skin. With such a powerhouse cast, she does a terrific job holding her own. Her scenes with Owen are wonderfully delightful. Then we have miss Murphy. Who up until know has not at all show anyone her worthiness of acting. But the few minutes on screen she has are such a joy to watch. Carla Gugino is a goddess, and when she's on screen every man in the theater commits an act of adultery just by looking at her. Devon Aoki is a mischievous little Miho, and does such a mouth-watering performance as the deadliest assassin you wonder if Black Mamba from Kill bill could handle her. And last but certainly not least is Jaime King. Watching her with her classic Blonde hair and pretty sapphire eyes, you can't help but agree why ""Men Prefer Blonde's"". Every time she was on screen, it seemed as if the room got a bit more brighter. <br/><br/>Now we all know that a movie is only as good as it's bad guys. And what bad guys we have to choose from. Elijah Wood does a complete 180 from playing the docile and uncertain hobbit Frodo. To the karate chopping cannibalistic creep Kevin. That constant smile of his is enough to make you feel uneasy for the rest of your day. And when you see him get what he deserves, you still feel robbed of vengeance as he stares blankly at the camerasmilinglaughing at you. Then of course there is the man who is the pure personified sociopath perverted evil little son of a bitch known as the yellow bastard. This guy makes you feel like something is crawling inside you, digesting your organs into a thousand swirling little maggots. He IS that evil. And Nick Sthal should really get and academy award for this role. Then we have Jackie Boy. Played by Del Toro. I enjoyed his character almost as much as Marv's. The scene with him and Clive Owen in the car is about the most amazing piece of cinematic talent this side of the universe. <br/><br/>Sin city broke such new ground with film that even the violent nature of the movieand it is violentcould not rob away the fact that it is the most Visually stunning movie EVER. Everything about this movie is beautiful. Sin city takes off the gloves; this is NOT your Saturday morning cartoon heroes. This is brutal raw and edgy. It pulls no punches and pummels the viewer with the action and suspense of a freight train. It's a world where God is back to his Old Testament tricks, and the devil is Clark Gable in a pin stripe suit with a Stetson fedora and a dry martini in his right hand, offering you all the things your black heart desires. And when the smoke clears and the curtains drawnyou can't help but ask for the nearest confession booth."
"angela-159","10","1","3","14 June 2005"," A very different kind of movie.
","I have very few complaints about this movie. It was gripping and exciting and completely different from anything else I have ever seen. There was the occasional nod to movies such as Pulp Fiction and even Batman, although fitting Sin City into any kind of genre is difficult (impossible?) to do.<br/><br/>To those who could not grasp the subtleties, yes, the women were all sex objects or victims (usually both), and the men were all equally single-faceted. Yes there were huge holes in the plots but once you asked yourself ""WHY would he do that?"" the answer is always ""It doesn't matter because it's not real!"" <br/><br/>The UK 18 certificate was something of a surprise. The violence was not shocking to me (and I'm a 48-year-old woman), but I felt it was more 'Tom and Jerry' than than anything else - no-one seems to ever be hurting as a result of it and the blood even tended to be white on black or even pink in places. As to the supposed nudity - well, I must have blinked and missed it or else it was cut, because I saw nothing that I hadn't seen on the beach at Brighton last week! <br/><br/>To sum up, a superb movie which looks outstanding, is performed beautifully and which I would like to think heralds a brand new way of writing for movies. Kind of ""POST post-modern""?<br/><br/>The best I've seen in years!"
"joaopedrolopes","10","1","3","13 June 2005"," Amazing movie
","I watched the movie today, and it is really amazing. It's a fresh air blow in a year without Kill Bill. The screenplay is very good, the cinematography is astonishing, and everything flows in such a breath-taking way, that you have to hang yourself in the chair to profit it all. The cast is also amazing, and everyone is pretty good in the movie. There is a different Bruce Willis, older and full of wisdom, a disfigured Mickey Rourke, a lovely Jessica Alba, a psychopath Eljah Wood, and so on, and so on...<br/><br/>I strongly recommend it to those who enjoy cult movies, since the others may find it too violent or alternative. Personally, I loved it!"
"dread2shookonez","10","1","3","11 June 2005"," Masterpiece
","An absolutely fantastic rendition of the comics. Outstanding performances from Del Toro, Owen and Rourke. Willis does well in a difficult role, whilst Alba sticks to what she does best - looks amazing, acts reasonably. If you like fast moving, action packed, sexy films, this is for you. If you like immersing plots, this is for you. If you like amazingly well directed and produced films this for you. If you like films, this is for you. You should get the idea by now. Although, you might not want to see it if you're a big Elijah Wood fan... and it's not because of his acting... Oh and if like me you're a huge MIchael Clarke Duncan fan, don't see this based solely on that fact because he has a minor role. Do, however see it to see 2 Fast, 2 Furious star Devon Aoki do some disgustingly good ninja star throwing, or whatever it's called. They should make it a sport. Anyhow, a great film from start to finish."
"Movieman02","10","1","3","11 June 2005"," Absolutely Beautiful
","This is a truly beautiful movie. It is black and white, but with a little bit of color. Mostly red, like blood and various objects. As you watch, everything looks real but you can tell that there is just something ""different"" about the way the cars drive and the way the people go about their lives. Nothing is as it seems.<br/><br/>The acting is impressive as well. Mickey Rourke plays his character, Marv, outstandingly. Hopefully, Marv will renew his squandered career and we will get to see him in more good movies. Bruce Willis has now shown that he can play a tough guy with feelings instead of just a tough guy. Nick Stahl was a creep. Jessica Alba was seductive. Brittney Murphy was helpless (in a good way).<br/><br/>I thought, for the first time, that this movie that was based on a comic book is actually a moving comic book. Spiderman did not leave that feeling, The Hulk did not leave that feeling, Dare Devil sure as hell didn't leave that feeling. Just Sin City. And it left me wanting more. Sequels Away! (I never thought I would say that!)"

","Kudos to Robert Rodriguez, Frank Miller and Quentin Tarantino for creating a mind-blowing movie experience! This movie is a worthy throne heir to Pulp Fiction. All actors and actresses did an excellent job and I am extremely happy to see Mickey Rourke back in the game. It's also great seeing Rutger Hauer back on the big screen! Hollywood, if you have any sense left, please bring Rutger back in the big leagues like Mickey! The movie also adds a nice touch of having Elijah Wood in a very sinister role. From the beginning until the end, the film is thrilling, exciting and full with very dark humor. I highly recommend this movie to adult audiences with a strong stomach and a love for movies."
"wordclock","10","1","3","10 June 2005"," Graphic in many ways
","I'm not given to flights of extravagant praise, being old and cynical, but this is the best film I've seen in years. Stylistically it's an absolute feast for the eyes, incredibly tight and economical. The actors attack their roles with a real enthusiasm, and some of the performances, particularly Micky Rourke and Clive Owen, are superb. It's great to see Rourke back, albeit unrecognisable in the prosthetics. Perhaps not Bruce Willis's best ever performance, but he's good too, though not as old and grizzled looking as he could have been. The women are beautiful and sexy, the men are dark and dangerous, the scenery is brooding and uncomfortable. OK I admit I'm a fan of Miller's graphic novel work, but I don't know the Sin City series at all. From that standpoint I have to say that it really doesn't matter if you are a fan of Frank Miller's work or not. However, the violence in this film is constant, ripe, and graphic. Even with the duotone look of this movie, and the fact that blood is generally shown white, not red, it's gory and not for the faint-hearted. I only remember ONE real laugh in it too. But the fact is that this is an amazing movie. The foyer of the cinema I went to had framed prints from the books alongside the same frames from the film, and if anyone has any doubts about it being true to the original - I've never seen such attention to detail. Awesome. Go and see it. You'll be talking about it for weeks."
"meetjopeblack","7","1","3","4 June 2005"," you'll leave the cinema uhm... with nothing?
","Contrary to the heading, the movie indeed was a visual fest. Here you'll see storyboards come to life with the editor not sleeping on the job. He plays with the shots, cuts them to effect fast paced action and wows the audience with a smörgåsbord of cinema techniques. The cinematography too is commendable. One gets the feel of lights and shadows, of danger and evil lurking around, of real film noir! The movie wouldn't work that well if it were in full color. Good that the director stuck with the comics' original color. Lastly, if you're in for an action (slash) violent treat, this movie is for you. Because of the explicitness of brutality, one will get numb somewhere in the middle of the film and then comes the down slope (?) of the movie...<br/><br/>...the movie is a three part episode thinly connected with each other. Perhaps if one will give more time for reflection she can connect the episodes with each other (really, what for?!).<br/><br/>Honestly, I have no idea what the film is about. I haven't gotten my hands on the comics to which this was based. After the hefty load of visuals, what next? The story is empty and you'll definitely leave the cineplex with nothing.<br/><br/>The movie though can inspire a discussion on what movies can show as regards violence and gore. What is art? How far can art go? A lot of plot twisted hyperboles were present in the movie, such as the invincible character of its protagonists and the monstrous nature of the characters (well, it's sin city, that's why!) . But the question still remains, what is sin city about? What does it want to tell its audience? Does art not aim to uplift the human condition? Does cinema mimic life for mimicry alone or does it want to tell something to the voyeur audience? Isn't the voyeuristic character of cinema designed to give its audience a glimpse of who and what they are? Is cinema simply for cinematic technique appreciation alone or for something else more?<br/><br/>With these questions, perhaps Sin City is not a waste after all. You'll leave the movie house with baffling questions about art, cinema, and life in general. Then, the movie is not a failure after all... you might not like it but let me tell you, there's more to the violence and gore than meets the eye."
"DrLenera","Null","1","3","6 June 2005"," Sort of a 10 year old boys version of film noir,tedious and annoying,if undoubtedly a technical and visual triumph
","Sin City has been called the closest a film has come to a comic book,and therein lies the problem. The two Spiderman films and Hellboy were fairly close to their sources,but they also never forgot that they were also FILMS,and that a great many people watching them will have never even looked at a comic book. As well as great action and effects they contained things like character development and at least reasonable plotting. Sin City,on the other had,just has a bunch of killers killing lots of people and falling for prostitutes. That's it. Hardly anything else. It's an extremely faithful adaptation, but it's not a good film.<br/><br/>The film's three stories are all set in what is like a 1940s film noir on acid. Therefore you have your tarnished heroes and your femme fatales,plus lots of hardboiled narration. These elements are blown up into almost surreal proportions. However,Sin City seems to forget that those old movies also had usually intricate plots and protagonists whose predicaments one could relate to on a basic level. The stories told in this film are all pretty much the same,involving a thuggish hero being involved with a woman,almost being killed and taking a bloody revenge. Surely the filmmakers could have chosen stories with more variety? As for the heroes or rather anti-heroes,we are never allowed to identify with or even care about them. Bruce Willis,Mickey Rourke and Clive Owen all look good,but we could be watching the Incredible Hulk in his Hulk form for all we care.<br/><br/>There's a monotony about the film. All the women are scantily clad and either hookers and strippers,how on earth can the female cast have found much reward in their roles? There is an incredible amount of brutality in the film, maybe the censors were kind because the film is mostly in black and white and some of the nastiest stuff is so stylized as to become almost abstract. There is definitely a place for extreme violence in films and it can be used well in many ways-for realism,for irony,to make a point,etc. I don't also believe that there is anything necessarily wrong with using violence just to shock. However,the constant bone crouching,head lopping,blood spurting action in Sin City just becomes tedious. In the first story,Mickey Rourke kills so many people that one almost feels like laughing,except that isn't particularly funny.<br/><br/>From a purely technical point of view Sin City is a triumph,and shows how CGI can be used very creatively indeed. The world of the film soon becomes a bore,but sometimes the CGI scapes approach the beautiful,beautiful not being a word I would normally use in relation to CGI. Sometimes they are very simple,such as the prison cell existing completely in a black void of nothing. Restraint is also shown in the use of colour. Sin City is mainly in black {and the black is often very black indeed} but sometimes a bit of colour appears briefly,often for the blood,but sometimes for more artistic purposes,such as a car journey where the inside of the car is subtly bathed in blue,green and other changing colours.<br/><br/>I don't like being hard on a film which was obviously made with no compromise. Too many potentially good films are weakened by studio interference,loss of courage by the director,pandering to a lower rating,etc. Director Robert Rodriguez and Frank Miller {who wrote the original comic books} had a vision and refused to waver from it for a moment. They deserve some credit. Unfortunately it seems they forgot the audience."

I just couldn't make any sense of the story. It set out well with the Willis-part, the Rourke-one, but then it started to fall apart... I am not much of a comic-lover. Perhaps this is a nitty-gritty kind of story telling that is best enjoyed on flat, flat paper? Rodiguez has never quite baffled me with stories from the heart, but this could have done with some deeper feelings and springs. Rourke wants to revenge Rosie because she took him for what he was? Come on! If he's really that inflammable, he would have been killed a long time ago."

","Beautifully stylised and I loved the significant colour additions to what is otherwise a black and white film. My wife and I talked for ages afterwards about the specifics of the colours. Then there's the bouncing around in time, as most noticeably utilised before in Pulp Fiction. These factors being the reasons I called the film arty. I can imagine people considering such a gratuitous film being unable to gain such an adjective, but IMHO it does.<br/><br/>Tight plot with no big holes and the slightly disparate stories connected nice and subtly at times, which is again a similarity to the style of Pulp Fiction.<br/><br/>Reasonable acting, nothing more. It would be a bit difficult to play it too straight with all the over the top action. As a guide, I'd liken the level of action and violence to that of Kill Bill.<br/><br/>Minorist of minor spoiler after the '*' :-<br/><br/>In addition to the Pulp Fiction time-jumps and the Kill Bill death toll, you could also see where Tarantino influenced the dialogue. He clearly wrote the lines for one of the hapless henchmen - * the one repeatedly berating his colleague in long drawn out monologues for failing to steal inconspicuous getaway cars. Very funny snippets.<br/><br/>I've never seen the comics this is based on and it was the cast list and the slick trailer that easily convinced me to go and see it. If I'm honest, it didn't live up to the trailer, but then not many films do.<br/><br/>I didn't want the film to end, which is always a good sign, but it wasn't good enough to make me really, really like it.<br/><br/>Major Spoiler in this paragraph :- <br/><br/>My only thing I disliked (although it was quite a error in my view) in the film was the very ending, where Hartigan decides the only way to protect Nancy is to kill himself so the bad guy won't have a motive to go after her anymore. Clearly that should really have been plan 'B'. Plan 'A' would be to go and kill the bad guy (perfect result) or die trying (no worse than plan 'B'). And who's to say that there weren't hit men currently still on the lookout for her? *shrug*<br/><br/>Closing comment: It was nice to see Frodo embracing his Gollum side."

The shots, the acting, the story and most importantly the way this film has been made. Totally original, deserves everyones money. I've seen this film several times so watch it its brilliant. Just one thing, what was the point of Josh Hartnett's character, he was only in at the beginning and end, can somebody clear this up for me????"

","In a nutshell its like a merge of ""Pulp Fiction"" and ""Batman"" only more messy and mostly all in Black and white. The movie is made up of three story's that are partially intertwined, yet the same theme is constant in them all. Three men with nothing to lose, wage a personal war with a corrupt authority its allay's and minions, finding aid from hookers and showgirls alike while killing off member of organized crimes, iris mercenary's, crooked cops, amateur hit men and cannibal priests.<br/><br/>Personally i found this movie too messy for my taste, i'd have given her more than 5 stars if it wasn't for the pointless mess made with almost all the killings, and those are clearly influences by the former videostore clerk and guest director for the film, Quentin Tarantino which b.t.w. you can see appear in one scene in the end of the movie."

","It's a truly magnificent movie, a really film noir. You've gotta love it, for those who like Max Payne, they'll love the movie. You're really dragged into the story. And I'd have to say BRUCIE IS BACK, I mean, after this movie and hostage. I really hope he keeps on going for several years. and then you got Jessica Alba, she's really a great talent. I even loved her in Honey, even though the movie was terrible. But in this movie I'm the most surprised by the acting talent of Mickey Rourke. I didn't know he had it. Normally I can't really enjoy a movie with him in it. This movie being in B/W really makes it fantastic. You've got some color now and then, but that's what makes it special. I'd have to say, this is one of the best movies I've seen in my entire life, maybe even the best one of em all, and me being a film freak really shows that's hard to achieve. Robert Rodriguez really got it going this time, I just hope he keeps working like this, because this is truly and utterly his best movie, the rest was building up to this one. Of course we gotta give credit to all the other actors too. But you'll remember Jessica, Bruce and Micky, the most. So I'd advice everyone to go and see it, but it is very violent so you've gotta have a strong heart. not for sensitive watchers. But for those who can't stand blood it isn't that bad, because it's all in black and white. But you can surely find the good in this movie. I almost forgot to credit Clive Owen, how could I. It's one of the best upcoming actors. In closer he really shows he can act and in King Arthur he acts pretty well too. but in closer he stands up straight between actors like Natalie Portman and Julia Roberts, we won't say Jude Law, because he's even better then Jude. And now he keeps himself up next to Bruce Willis, one of the greatest of all times. except this few failures, but that's a bit logical I think. You've gotta try everything, surely while you act as well as he does. But you've gotta pay attention to Clive Owen, his voice is also perfect for a film noir. And off course you can look at all the pretty girls. The dancing scene of Jessica Alba was amazing."

","At first sight, you belong to the ""City."" You belong to the night. In light of the plots, two out of three are alright. ""Who cares? They're all basically bad anyway,"" said film buff/East Carolina University professor in regard to the characters derived from Frank Miller's ""Sin City: The Big Fat Kill"" (1994). Introducing new audiences to his graphic novel ""Sin City: A Dame to Kill For"" (1993) solves that problem. Each silver-screen account takes place roughly around the same period. Dwight (Clive Owen) hints at the outcome of Marv's (Mickey Rourke) tale in the comic. The Hollywood triumvirate or directorial firm of Miller, Rodriguez, & Tarantino omitted the section on-screenso much for a nice bit of foreshadowing. The inevitable still shocks people when it happens. The parts that some felt dragged in the series now lie on the cutting room floor, so the film flows like an ""action-packed thrill ride."" ""Sin City"" went unrated for weeks before its release due to an abundance of graphic violencecertain to appear unadulterated on DVD. The Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) almost issued an NC-17 instead of R rating. Miller's initial illustrational style points out the symbolism scattered throughout the all-but-black-and-white flick. It does not take an optometrist to determine the significance of three gateways to the soul: The eyes of Cardinal (Rutger Hauer) Roark gleam green with envy. The green greed in Marley Shelton's pair grab Josh Hartnett (see Sin City: The Babe Wore Red and Other Stories, 1994). A case of the blues strikes one of the ""Gilmore Girls"" (Alexis Bledel) gone wild. ""What's the deal with that Yellow Bastard?"" Master Sgt. Weinfurtner asked. ""His backed up urine must be coming out his pores."" Detective John (Bruce Willis) Hartigan would agree based on the ""stink"" of his nemesis for this film noir. Furthermore, Kevin (Elijah Wood) represents Miller's testament to Charlie Brown during his adolescent yearsthe result of a hard-knock life. If moviegoers walk down the right back alley to ""Sin City,"" they will find the harsh realities of Frank Miller's directing debut."

","I have no idea what ""film noir"" is, and I can honestly say that only comic book/ film adaptation I've seen is the original Batman.

It is the most original, entertaining and ""in your face"" movie I've seen in a long time. I was riveted from start to finish. The story lines were clear to understand and each kept my attention. Yes, it has over the top violence, but it was handled in a way that I had little trouble with it. (DId have to closed my eyes couple of times, though. ) The acting was superb, especially Elijah Wood and Mickey Rourke (my favorite story line), The nudity was done well. I was not offended nor found it to be degrading to women. The ladies of Sin City were portrayed as strong, independent, beautiful, sexy and in control. Can't get more liberated than that! This movie is not just for ""fanboy"" as some reviewers have said. Here's one mature audience member that can't wait for the DVD to come out."
"rosscinema","8","1","3","1 May 2005"," Sin City is both faithful and brilliant
","It would be very easy to describe Sin City as an exercise in style but the truth is that this is one of those films that's really indescribable, although brilliantly so. Three of Frank Miller's graphic stories are brought to the screen and the first involves a hardened detective named Hartigan (Bruce Willis) who saves an 11 year old girl named Nancy (Makenzie Vega) from Roark Jr. (Nick Stahl) who's a pedophile but has family connections in both politics and religion.<br/><br/>*****SPOILER ALERT***** Hartigan ends up in jail for 8 years but when he gets out he finds Nancy (Jessica Alba) who's now a dancer in a hole in the wall called Kadie's and he accidentally leads Yellow Bastard (Stahl again) to her.<br/><br/>The second story involves a deformed brute and ex-con named Marv (Mickey Rourke) who wakes up next to a dead hooker and realizes out that he's being framed. Marv meets the dead hookers twin sister and he figures out that her death has to do with a silent nerd named Kevin (Elijah Wood) who's a cannibal but is protected by Cardinal Roark (Rutger Hauer) who's a family member.<br/><br/>Story number 3 has a semi decent hooligan named Dwight (Clive Owen) dating a waitress from Kadie's named Shellie (Brittany Murphy) but her old boyfriend Jackie Boy (Benicio Del Toro) refuses to let her go. Dwight follows him to Old Town where the hookers live but Jackie Boy gets himself killed which puts things in chaos because the police and organized crime might want to take over the area since Jackie Boy is a cop!<br/><br/>This is credited with having 3 directors but the truth of the matter is that Sin City is a Robert Rodriguez film from start to finish. Not only is he the main director but he also did the cinematography with HD cameras and the editing as well. Frank Miller is given credit because he was on the set every day overseeing everything and the entire look of the film comes from his comics and storyboards. Quentin Tarantino directed one scene in the film (as a favor to his friend Rodriguez) and it's the one involving Owen driving to the tar pits and having a conversation with the head of Del Toro. The cinematography is in black and white except with a few splashes of other colors for artistic reasons and one of the more interesting choices Rodriguez made was with all the bloodshed that occurs there is no red blood shown and the color white is used instead. What makes this film truly special (for me, anyway) is the story involving Rourke as the deformed brute called Marv and even though he's hidden under a ton of make-up Rourke delivers one of his most memorable performances to date. With Miller's brutally edgy characterization and Rodriguez's visual flair Rourke is given all the ingredients to bring this character to life on screen and he does it with a gusto that audiences haven't seen from him in years. The script does an admirable job of giving insights into his character to the point that the viewer actually starts to understand him such as his gratitude to the hooker Goldie (Jaime King) for her kindness but it also delves deeper into his psyche that he mentions that he worries about becoming a homicidal maniac. Quite simply the character Marv is one of the toughest SOB's ever captured on film! The other actors that appear in the film are all well cast as well from Willis, Owen, Alba, Wood, Del Toro, and also Rosario Dawson, Michael Clarke Duncan, and Alexis Bledel. This is a modern film noir set in one of those alternate universes where we see old cars and characters talking about ""dames"" but we also see modern devices such as cell phones and helicopters and Sin City at times reminds viewers of Gotham City. Some may find the violence too much for their taste but I was enthralled by practically every minute of this film and the great news is that there are already plans to bring more of these dark stories to the screen."
"Kronocide","Null","1","3","29 April 2005"," ""What a sweet kid.""
","The movie is running right now in a little window right next to this one. I knew the comic quite well and I've followed Miller's work since the 80's, and I've been reading this board, so I pretty much knew what to expect. However, one thing I didn't expect was all the goddamned, never-ending babbling. Some of it is _extremely_ expeditionary... ""And then I blah blah, and I thought blah blah blah, and therefore I will now blah blah blah, and I bet you never thought of this, blah blah blah blah frigging blah BLAH!"" They make Blofeld look tongue-tied! It never ends! My eeeeaaaaaaarsssss!!!!! You know, hard men don't talk incessantly. Sort of a rule of thumb that you might pick up if you watch a Sergio Leone movie. (Bet Rodriguez has never watched a spaghetti western...) Oh well, anyway. Some of it looks cool, although I can't quite figure out if it actually looks cool, or if it's just me going, ""hey! that's looks exactly like the comic!"" It's not really the same thing. I'm glad they had the ""-Haven't seen you around in a while. -I had to kill some cops""-frame, although they softened up the dialog. Go figure.<br/><br/>Mickey Rourke's talk over is the only one that works, mostly because his voice is so messed up you can't really tell if he's wincing or not. Owen's is a close second, and that's just because parts of his... part, works really good as comedy. I think it was even meant as comedy. Bruce Willis is so not pulling this off. You can tell he's got nothing but grapes on his mind when he reads the first part of the voice-over. I guess he's been in enough movies to recognize cheese when he sees it, even if he's no big thinker (and never claimed to be, hey, I like the guy).<br/><br/>Every now and then I get an ""art movie"" vibe. Then I quickly realize that it's because periodically, it's boring like an art movie. I really have liked the Owen part best so far, it had some funny bits and pieces.<br/><br/>All in all, I don't hate the movie. I can sort of chuckle along with Miller and Rodriguez frequently enough to make it worth the watch, and that's more than I can say for most films I see. But you know something? I watched the Star Trek: The Next Generation episodes Chain of Command I and II yesterday, and in that episode of a weekly TV series for young adults, during a few scenes where Picard is tortured by the ""Cardassians,"" there is better acting, more plot, more substance, and more actual characters, than this movie has produced in toto. And that, at the end of the day, gotta mean something."
"VampireHorde","10","1","3","29 April 2005"," Sinfully sexy and sinfully addictive!
","Wow! That was my first reaction on a screening of this film. Many things drew me to the theater to see this film: <br/><br/>#1 - It's a comic adaptation done EXACTLY in Frank Miller's style.<br/><br/>#2 - Jessica Alba, 'nuff said! <br/><br/>#3 - Robert Rodriguez has never done a movie that hasn't disappointed and is always intriguing to watch.<br/><br/>I could go on and on but it's clear why this movie rocks: it's seeing Jessica Alba portray the stripper-with-a-heart-of-gold Nancy Callahan. The movie adverts specifically focus only on 6 characters but it was Jessica that caught my attention. <br/><br/>But enough about that, lets discuss the film: The film starts off with the first half of ""That Yellow Bastard"" storyline and then cuts halfway and then transitions to ""The Hard Goodbye"". Once THG is done, it transitions to ""The Big Fat Kill"". Once TBFK is done, it transitions back to the second half of ""That Yellow Bastard"". That's the movie in a nutshell.<br/><br/>--THAT YELLOW BASTARD: Bruce Willis plays the good cop role. AGAIN. Only this time he isn't yippee-ki-yaying his way on the screen. As you watch the film, you see Bruce play his role like a straight arrow. He never strays from convention and because of that, it's quite boring to see Bruce do his thing (since its been done a bunch of times in other flicks). But that doesn't mean he kills (literally). Another reason that the TYB storyline succeeds is because of the scorching Jessica Alba. I hate to say it, but Jessica herself DOES NOT have enough screen time. Her strip dances (is it safe to be called a stripper even if you DON'T show T&A?) are squeaky clean and she barely has enough lines or emotion in the story to care.<br/><br/>I loved Jessica in ""Idle Hands"" and ""The Sleeping Dictionary"" but she doesn't have enough to do in this film. Even though she has a cameo in ""The Hard Goodbye"" storyline, it just isn't enough. And YES, I have read the comic books and its safe to say that Jessica's character doesn't have enough to do in the book either. SIGH.<br/><br/>--THE HARD GOODBYE: It's kinda difficult to accept the fact that the story takes place so quickly. Marv (the main character of this story) has the best one night stand of his life with a goddess, wakes up an hour later to find her dead and goes on a deadly revengeful rampage. Sounds simple, right? I found this to be my only problem. Other than that, the story is super hilarious! It's great to see Mickey Rourke back to form after watching crap like ""Another 9 1/2 Weeks"". He pulls off the Marv character with such smooth panache that he LITERALLY steals the entire movie.<br/><br/>Watch as Marv is beat up from one sequence to the next and see him keep going. Marv doesn't stop until he is literally dead.<br/><br/>--THE BIG FAT KILL: A whole bunch of dialogue in the comic book was omitted for the movie. Dwight (the main character for the story) had a whole assload of dialogue in the book that is NEVER heard in the film. But after seeing the film, it was better left that way. The scenes would've taken way too long had all that dialogue been left in.<br/><br/>Clive Owen is a bit sketchy in this role. Since the character in the comic was a muscular character with a badass attitude, it was kind of difficult to accept Clive as Dwight since he pulls off a more James Bond-like smoothness rather than a rugged toughness (like in the comic book). Hey, he even cracks his accent as he tries to sound straight American. Other than those gripes, TBFK was a great adaptation. Rosario Dawson pulls off the Gail character perfectly (except for one character trait that she excluded). Benicio absolutely perfects Jackie Boy's form with no problems. It's so hard to see anyone else as Jackie Boy.<br/><br/>All in all, this film is super stylish. Since all the frames are based on the comic book, there was little room for error. If you hated this film, it's because you expected too little from the flick and it gave you 10x more than you thought. Don't hesitate, see the film, buy the DVD when it comes out, read the comic book! Immerse yourself in the sinfully sexy and sinfully addictive world...of Frank Miller's ""Sin City."""

","I feel guilty for loving this film, but there you have it. ""Sin City"" is ""Pulp Fiction"" with even less redeeming moral value. If you're easily offended (pretty much by anything), stay far away. Otherwise, sit back and revel in this movie's noir-soaked atmosphere.<br/><br/>I've not read the Frank Miller graphic novels upon which this film is based, but I've seen the illustrations, and I have to say that ""Sin City"" triumphs in bringing the look of the comics to the screen. I'm not usually a fan of style over substance (I seem to be one of the few that thought last year's ""Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow"" a dismal failure), but I could have watched Frank Miller's and Robert Rodriguez's stunning monochrome compositions all day. Not since Dorothy opened the door of her house on to a Technicolor Munchkinland has black and white cinematography been juxtaposed to color more effectively. The CGI effects are flawless, and a terrific and audacious pulpy score pulses throughout the entire film.<br/><br/>Three equally bizarre stories are interlinked, again a la ""Pulp Fiction,"" and brought to life by a cast of not-quite-above the title stars: Mickey Rourke, Benicio Del Toro, Clive Owen, Nick Stahl, Rosario Dawson, Brittany Murphy, Elijah Wood (creepy as hell!), Michael Clark Duncan. The only box office actor is Bruce Willis, who plays a role that fits him like a glove, that of the melancholy hero past his prime who wants to prove he's got one more knockout punch in him before he's KO'd for good.<br/><br/>The only reason this film rises above cheap titillation is that everyone involved with it commits 100% to a common vision of what the film should be. There's something admirable about the way the filmmakers refuse to compromise their (admittedly) disgusting visions to appease the moral conservatives, or to get a lesser rating, or to make more money at the box office. ""Sin City"" is a movie for adults that appeals to the thirteen-year-old in all of us, and what fun it is.<br/><br/>Grade: A+"

Many people are calling this film the ""Pulp Fiction"" of it's decade. At this point, it looks like they're right. The visuals of the film are absolutely stunning. If the sound had cut out half way through the movie, I would have stayed in the theater just to see the visuals and then bought another ticket to hear the rest of the story. this is not your typical comic book adaptation.

"Nephalim","10","1","3","17 April 2005"," To All the Haters
","SPOILERS AHEAD I can't say I'm surprised to see both the amount of people in love with this film and the amount of people who think it deplorable. But I'd like to address some of the comments I've seen.<br/><br/>First, I loved this film. I think it's the first film in a long time that has done something truly unique that works. I'm glad that it was so uncompromisingly faithful to the comic. Now, obviously, I'm not going to take the position that everyone has to like this film. But I think that some things have been unfairly stated about this film, and I'd like to address them.<br/><br/>The image of women in this movie has come up repeatedly. It's accused of being maliciously sexist, and unfairly so. I agree that no respectable women are in this film, and I agree that they are stereotypical, comic-book knockouts. But that doesn't make this movie sexist, and the reason that's so, is because it treats men EXACTLY the same way. There are no male role models in this film, either. Though some characters may have good intentions, they're all despicably ruthless. Marv may be out on a righteous revenge quest, but does that merit cutting off a man's arms and legs and leaving him for a bloodthirsty dog? You want to tell me that tearing the genitalia off the same man TWICE is something people should emulate? No character can justify their actions in any rational manner. Similarly, all the male characters are muscle-bound supermen. They are not striving for realism or accurate depictions of how people look or act. EVERYONE here is a fantasy, not just the women.<br/><br/>In fact, the most sympathetic characters in the entire movie are Lucille and Nancy. That they're open with their sexuality doesn't take away from the fact that they're both good, strong people, nor does the fact that they're both victims. Lucille does the right thing. It gets her killed, but it's still one of the most moral decisions anyone in the film makes. On top of that, the character with the highest body count is likely Miho, and she's presented as, by far, the most skilled combatant among the cast. So, it makes me wonder how one can claim that this movie is unfair to women. And if you expect women to be cast as moral, righteous people ONLY because they're women, then I'd say that a rather sexist expectation to go into a movie with.<br/><br/>I'm confused when I hear people say that it glorifies violence against women. The men guilty of crimes against women in this film meet with such gruesome and torturous fates that I'm very hesitant to call them glorified.<br/><br/>So of course, there's the overwhelming violence. I agree, this is probably the most explicitly violent movie out there. These ""heroes"" don't get revenge by killing their opponents, they get revenge by torturing them to death. Everyone is shamelessly ruthless, and the authors had to in turn make their villains so disgustingly horrific that we can tolerate the amount of punishment inflicted upon them when their pursuers finally catch up with them. Kevin couldn't just have killed Goldie. He made Lucille watch as he ate her hand, and displays the heads of the other girls he killed and ate as hunting trophies on his wall. Only now can we, the audience, allow Marv to quarter him and leave him to be eaten alive.<br/><br/>And that's what this movie's about. There IS meaning and poignancy underneath all the blood and gore. I won't blame anyone for being overwhelmed. The only reason this movie is bearable is because of the unique comic-booky perspective we see it from. The high-contrast black and white, with splashes of colour in a pair of bright red sneakers, piercing blue eyes, golden stream of urine, or that yellow bastard, makes it surreal. The most intense scenes are depicted in inverse silhouettes.<br/><br/>Which brings me to the argument of style and substance, which comes up whenever a highly stylistic movie comes out. That it involves a style no one's ever seen before leaves it open for the easy-to-make accusation that that's all there is to it. But the style and content of Sin City work together. Both are nothing without the other. If this was shot like every other movie, the story would be overwhelming for even the strongest stomachs. And if the story told was the same as every detective revenge story, the style would be pointless. But here, they act together to make one of the few truly unique movies in years.<br/><br/>If you don't like it, fine. But this IS a good movie."
"star2pilot","9","1","3","17 April 2005"," One of the Best
","Beyond simply being a movie, this film was a sensory experience. Every element of the picture was refined with artistic styling usually reserved for those foreign-speaky-artsy garbage-can movies that you only ever see if your tax bracket is higher than your I.Q. bracket or you are pursuing a PhD Ostentatious Culturalism. Instead of cheesy, brainiac culture food, this film delivers a gritty, thought provoking action drama that will stick with you long after the credits roll.<br/><br/>While I am strongly opposed to the modern concept of the anti-hero, a person who does bad things for a good or noble purpose, Sin City pulls its characters together with a remarkably realistic feel, amidst a sharply unrealistic (stylistic?) setting. Unlike other anti-heroes I have seen portrayed in movies like Enough and Gigli, these characters seem to lack any pretense of decency. They are flawed people doing the wrong thing in a world that is corrupt beyond imagination. Even the noblest character amongst them, Hartigan (Bruce Willis), would admit impure motives. <br/><br/>The level of violence in the film is a bit too high for my usual tastes, but the way it is filmed an expressed makes it tolerable. Most of the characters seem to have some kind of supernatural fortitude that, while not always saving their lives, makes the quantity and quality of the violence that can be perpetrated on their persons a morbid spectacle to behold. However, while violent imagery propels, the film, there is a sharp mind behind the wheel that steers it clear from being another bashable movie like House of a Thousand Corpses. <br/><br/>Sin City is funny, sexy, suspenseful, shocking and intelligent (without being too high-brow). You simply must watch this movie."

"egl2r","4","1","3","12 April 2005"," All style, no substance
","Visually, 'Sin City' is incredibly impressive - it's impossible to conceive a more effective rendition of the modern comic/graphic novel. Fans of that genre, and devotees of slasher movies and Tarantino-style gorefests will be duly impressed.<br/><br/>I was looking for something with more substance (I know, stupid me, should have known better), and came away disappointed. The best thing about classic noir literature and movies, reflected to some extent in graphic novels by Frank Miller and others, is the sense they convey of social disarray and alienation. The fun is not just in the thrill, but in the knowledge that the sex and violence is telling you something about modern society - even, in an ironic way, criticizing our infatuation with sex and violence itself.<br/><br/>In 'Sin City', as in all the Tarantino-inspired crap so common today, sex and violence is an end in itself. True, Tarantino and his disciples love to masquerade as artists and cultural critics. Yet their cinematic sadism is simply juvenile. It consists of nothing more than pushing the envelope a little further, making your violence a little more graphic, a little more stomach-churning (castration, torture, suicide) - and outraging the same conventions that the dictates of political correctness makes it safe to outrage (the Catholic Church is always an easy target, and sure to delight the usual crowd: thus shooting a priest in the confessional, making a cardinal a cannibal, etc.; bashing the police provides the conventional anti-establishment tone). Of self-criticism of modernity by a modern there is, of course, none. - making Sin City wholly unlike the really great works of classic noir.<br/><br/>Was I the only one who found it ludicrous that while we're supposed to approve the torture, murder, etc., some of it aimed not just at villains but those who are in the wrong place at the wrong time, we are still asked to show outrage at wife-beaters and child-molesters? Rodriquez, Tarantino, et al. still have their taboos - perhaps more than most of us.<br/><br/>Of course, as soon as you criticize 'Sin City' for its violence you'll be labeled as a religious fanatic or a hopeless prude. But these kind of accusations are nothing more than a dodge. I have no problem with book or movie representations of sex and violence, used artistically. Used as it is in Sin City, Natural Born Killers, or Kill Bill, it's just pointless and boring."

","If you're my age (44), you remember what a mind-blowing experience _Star Wars_ was when it came out. If you're older or younger than I, but are interested in film, you probably nonetheless have a good since of what a genre defining/breaking film Star Wars was.<br/><br/>_Sin City_ is not better or worse than _Star Wars_, and it's not more or less important. It's another film in the same class-less class: a sui generis MiND BLaST!. Rodriguez and Miller have made something that enlarges our sense of possibility for both film and comics. (I could say ""graphic novels"" instead of ""comics"", but after _Sin City_, we don't have to flop around to find elevated terms for this other wonderfully creative and vital American visual art form.) <br/><br/>I haven't memorized Citizen Kane or anything... I'm not the font of all film knowledge... but, I can't think of another performance to match Rourke's in terms of sheer stage presence. He's a beast... it seems like he's there in the theater with you. Amazing. Oscar-worthy.<br/><br/>Willis also does a great job, but -- perhaps because he's turned in so many solid performances in recent years (esp. Pulp Fiction) -- he doesn't take off the top of your head like Mickey does.<br/><br/>And (here I really am damning with faint praise), I can't fault Clive. I can't imagine how anyone could play his part better, but, he's overshadowed by his villain and his ladies. I don't mind that at all.... I LOVE that. I love the way the camera is learning to caress the un-heros with this film. But the anthology format invites one to compare the three male leads, and on that scale, Owen comes up short (part of it is the part).<br/><br/>I love this film. I will watch it for the rest of my life. I suspect I'll find more to notice and cherish each time. I more-than-suspect that what I notice and cherish will be visual and conceptual: it's in these realms that it breaks truly new ground.<br/><br/>Oh... and yeah... it's really violent and sexist.

","Imagine if Alfred Hitchcock made a film-noir in the nineteen forties, with access to the same movie making technology that we have today. Then imagine that Quentin Tarantino co-directed. What you have imagined is ""Sin City"", the new movie directed by Robert Rodriguez and Frank Miller, from Miller's comic books.<br/><br/>The movie is, in a way, an astonishment, because Rodriguez has given us no prior evidence that he is capable of directing anything better than standard stylish action shlock. Oh man, is he ever.<br/><br/>The film takes place in Basin ""Sin"" City, a Gotham-New York hybrid that probably jumped straight out of Frank Miller's nightmares. When the sky is not grey, it is red, it is always raining, and the population all seems to follow only one convention: they have a considerable amount of dirty laundry. It is as if Rodriguez reached into ""The Maltese Falcon"", grabbed the city, and threw it into a vat of Gatorade - which is a compliment, of course.<br/><br/>After a short scene at the beginning - which plays like a teaser, hinting at Sin City's nature - we are launched into three short stories, all intersecting briefly in one place: at a cheap strip joint outside the city.<br/><br/>We start with Marv (Mickey Rourke), a massive, rough sadist whose mug looks like a cross between Mr. Incredible's and a brick. We don't know much about his past, but we know it's dirty, and that he'd probably deserve a lethal injection over a good woman. But he gets a good woman, which seems like a miracle to him, and they spend a night together. Possibly the best night of his life. When he wakes up, she's dead. He wants to find out why, who, how, and how to kill those guilty. He says his quest is ""Worth dying for, worth killing for, worth going to hell for."" Then we take a leap into Dwight's world. Dwight (Clive Owen) is running from the law, and has just hooked up with Shellie (Brittany Murphy), the girl who's loved him all her life. But Shellie's ex boyfriend Jackie Boy (Benicio Del Toro) won't have it, and he barges into their apartment with some heavies. After a brief quibble, Jackie Boy makes his exit, violently drunk. Dwight suspects he's on his way to Old Town to inflict hell on the prostitutes who act as law there, the prostitutes who saved Dwight's life, his friends. He races off to help them.<br/><br/>And last but not least is the story of Det. John Hartigan (Bruce Willis), one of the rare hero cops of Sin City. He saves a little girl from Junior, a pedophile (Nick Stahl). But Junior has an important dad, and Hartigan goes to prison for nearly a decade, framed for the crime. When he gets out, he races to find Nancy Callahan (Jessica Alba), the little girl who's now all grown up and still targeted by Junior. But Junior's gone through some disturbing changes since his last bout with Hartigan...<br/><br/>The many characters are wide-ranging archetypes: heroes (Owen, Willis), anti-heroes (Rourke), villains (Rutger Hauer, Michael Clarke Duncan), psychos (Stahl, Del Toro, Elijah Wood), good girls (Alba, Murphy, Carla Gugino), considerably more interesting bad girls (Rosario Dawson, Devoan Aoki), and some mysterious figures (Josh Hartnett).<br/><br/>Most of the actors are perfectly cast, some of them deliver performances worth remembering, particularly Rourke, Owen, Willis and Del Toro. They are great at taking these characters and becoming them, while still maintaining their star presence. Bruce Willis reminds us of Bruce Willis, but we remember him as John Hartigan. Del Toro, Wood and Stahl are the only actors who've been cast against type.<br/><br/>The style of the film is what connects the three stories, as well as the strip joint, and similar themes about camaraderie, love, hate, torture and redemption. The movie is like a comic book, as we've all said, but you can only understand it if you've seen it. Then you'll agree, it feels like it was inked.<br/><br/>Rodriguez will be remembered for this movie, and this movie will be remembered because of Frank Miller's genius and imagination. It's bloody, yeah, and it's got quite a bit of nudity, but you can't imagine the movie without it. I should hope no one would complain, because what do they expect, seeing a movie ""guest-directed"" by Tarantino, the man himself. Tarantino's scene is one of the best and strangest of the movie, it involves Clive Owen, Benicio Del Toro, a car, some flashing lights and a ""PEZ dispenser"".<br/><br/>I don't know if the movie will survive like ""Pulp Fiction"" has, but I hope it does, because it's almost as good at combining pop culture references, homages, action, harsh violence and deep character insights into one, even narrative.<br/><br/>The movie is a joy, a dark, neo-noir, violent, sometimes disgusting joy.<br/><br/>9/10."

THere is a style of very dark humor in this movie that to some may just seem awful. But it fits with the movie and once you accept the darkness of the movie the humor will follow. THe story is a little more complicated. Everything takes place in ""Basin City,"" a Sin City that seems to follow a twisted form of Murphy's law that any thing that can go wrong, will go wrong. And many things go wrong in sin city usually ending in death. There are a number of different stories taking place throughout the movie, nonetheless, each story is exceptional in it's own way. THe acting is an amalgam of Hollywood and of any film noir, but the fight scenes are engrossing (especially since bullets seem to do nothing but slow you down a little). Like I said before, this movie isn't for everyone, however the style is in a category all it's own and for those who enjoyed the comics, the Sin City movie will far surpass every expectation you had from the books and leave you wanting more."

The proof that the directing and the writing are perfect lie in the fact that you don't have to be a Grade A Fanatic to love and appreciate Sin City, but you might become one anyway.<br/><br/>It is a fantastic movie, from beginning to end...you're in Basin City. You'd think the colours and background, ripped straight from the comics themselves, would help you stay one step removed from reality at all times, but it pulls you in completely. You love every murdering, kill-happy one of the characters. It's a crazy, weird, and beautiful world full of beautiful women who can either drive you crazy with one look or beat the crap out of you...with a really big smile on their faces. And of course, the men are tough, a little scary, and have world's most determined sense of justice. I found that the best part...despite all the violence...There was none done senselessly.<br/><br/>The acting was fantastic, you could tell everyone got into their parts. I went to see it with friends and they brought up the point that if you're not adjusted to the Noir style of film...you'll stumble upon hearing the first words...but that's it. The actors bring everything to life. The casting couldn't have been done better. I can't even go into detail or I'd be here all day. I will say...it was nice to see Josh Hartnett play a role I didn't hate him in.<br/><br/>The part of this movie very few people have mentioned, as it gets lost in the shuffle of beautiful effects and the violence talk, is the humour. No, it's not a big comedy full of laugh out loud lines. But there are more than a few classic one liners. It just the sort of twisted humour you can love.<br/><br/>Overall, it's a fantastic movie. It's violent from beginning' to end, but in such a way that it's like getting slapped then being kissed. Which, sometimes, is what noir films are all about. The story lines are intriguing, and well told. The Catholic Church gets a quick kick in the pants, but it's barely perceptible. The speech is beautiful and refreshing. The look of the movie is amazing, you could go deaf and still love it. I'd tell everyone to see this film. But this is not for the weak or faint of heart. If you're a flincher at violence, you might be okay. But if violence upsets your system...stay home and rent Bambi (oh, wait..never mind).<br/><br/>And Leave The kids at home, Please.

","Sin City reminded me of only one other film I've ever seen: Kill Bill, vol. 1, which ranks as one of my all-time favorites. The founding mythologies of the two movies are completely different, and I prefer Tarantino's Shaolin legends to Miller's noir graphic novels--but not by much. There's an awful lot to fall for in Sin City, from the ridiculous cars to the even more ridiculously alluring women.<br/><br/>The best thing about the movie, though, is the three leading male heroes, two of whom are just as cold-blooded as their depraved and just-as-memorable foils, who gleefully inhabit depths of the human soul usually only hinted at by movies. Willis, Rourke, and Owen each give memorable performances that force you to accept the moral logic of Sin City, which despite the consistent displays of gore shines through every scene of the movie. As with Kill Bill, anyone who tells you that this movie is itself morally bankrupt or meaningless simply wasn't paying any attention.<br/><br/>If you've got the stomach for it, and are willing to suspend your disbelief and accept Miller's gritty universe, you absolutely won't regret spending your $9 to see Sin City in the theater."

"CharmedAlice","9","1","3","8 April 2005"," This much fun should be illegal.
","Sin City was originally a comic book series by Frank Miller. The movie is based upon three of his graphic novels. It is co-directed by Robert Rodriguez and Frank Miller himself, and also features Quentin Tarantino as a ""special guest director."" Anyone familiar with Tarantino will have no problem figuring out which scene he directed, trust me! The script was lifted directly from the graphic novels, which were also used as storyboards (did Rodriguez really want to be as faithful to the source as possible, or was he just too lazy to adapt them? You decide). I have never read any of the Sin City books, but even so I'm happy to know that I'm getting the real deal through the movie, and not some lame parody.<br/><br/>Although Sin City is the creation of Frank Miller, Rodriguez and Tarantino are right at home for the tone of the movie is in many ways very similar to that of their own movies: giddily violent, surreal, stylistic, and darkly comedic. A guilty pleasure that's really too creative to be called ""guilty"" in the first place.<br/><br/>I'm not joking when I say that seeing Sin City purely for the photography is a perfectly good reason. If you think Sky Captain was a good enough example of what can be done with a green screen and digitally inserted backgrounds, think again! Sin City takes this new style to a whole new level - the photography is so powerful that it might as well be its own character. Not only does it help to recreate a genuine graphic novel feel, it is a perfect physical manifestation of the tone and atmosphere of Sin City itself. Saying the photography in this film is ""gorgeous"" is an obscene understatement. It's absolutely flawless. Every shot is different and exciting, a miniature work of art in itself (hence coming directly from Miller's panels). The film is mainly black-and-white, but there are little bursts of very bright colors throughout. The color, like the digital backgrounds, adds something infinitely important to Sin City that makes it a full package. The best moments during the film for me were when the color caught me totally off-guard; really not kidding when I say breathtaking.<br/><br/>The plot of Sin City was the only area where I felt something lacking in the movie. Reading comics is a different experience than watching movies, and I agree with the critics who say that Miller's storytelling style has a hard time being translated for cinema. It is made up of three loosely intertwining stories, which may leave some viewers wishing things would connect and form one unit more than they do. The film is more like a glance into the lives of Sin City's residents, not one coherent story with a beginning, middle and end. Additionally, there is an overabundance of voice-over, and while the cast does okay, it does get rather tedious after awhile.<br/><br/>My final complaint with the movie is that there are so, so many characters and not enough movie to do any of them justice. The cast is mind-blowing; I can't think of anyone who was not perfect to a T for their role. The characters themselves are endlessly interesting and fun, even when they come off as one-sided (which, to my amazement, does not hurt them). Some character/cast highlights:<br/><br/>Mickey Rourke as Marv: Funny how the ugly sociopath is one of the most sympathetic and superhero-like characters. His physicality gives him a presence like no other.<br/><br/>Brittany Murphy as Shellie: Brittany completely knocks this small role out of the park. I'd even say her performance was the most heartfelt of them all - somehow, she connects with her character and really embodies her to a level that I couldn't feel with the rest of the cast. She's vulnerable, sexy, AND hardcore. What more could you want? Endlessly cool.<br/><br/>Alexis Bledel as Becky: What a pleasant surprise! If you don't already love her from Gilmore Girls, get ready to gain some respect for this ripe 23-year-old. While her role is not as removed from Rory as you might expect (!), it's great to see her as part of this ensemble and in a project that really flaunts her beauty and screen presence in a way that Gilmore Girls has yet been able to do. And may I say, I am honestly not exaggerating when I say that the shots with her blue eyes are the single most arresting thing I've ever seen in my life. I was literally paralyzed. We're talking mouth hanging open, trying not to drool, heart stopping in chest, unaware of the existence of anything in the Universe except those goddamn eyes.<br/><br/>Sin City is (obviously) not a ""realistic"" movie, and thankfully it doesn't try to be. Nor does it try to justify itself morally (or visually), which is just so refreshing in our increasingly P.C. world. Yes, the violence is extravagant, yes, all the men are sadistic bastards, and YES, all the women are gorgeous prostitutes. Sin City dares you to ask yourself, what's wrong with that?!! Their world is not ours (luckily), but why not have some fun and enjoy yourself while you're there? In fact, for an extremely violent and morally questionable movie, there is a surprising amount of heart and humanity in it. I think that's my favorite thing about it. One of my biggest issues with our culture is how we all deny the ""evil"" and ""bad"" parts of ourselves when they clearly do exist. Seriously, just try admitting to yourself that you have had the urge to kill someone. Not saying by any means that you ever would, but don't you feel better now? What I'm trying to say is how amazing it was that Sin City made me feel so human."

","This film is the true definition of an adaptation of a comic book to big screen flick. This movie is packed with action, drama, comedy, and even a little romance. The cast is excellent and each member delivers a great performance. The cinematic sequences are flashy and are filled with energy. The black and white look gives this film a classic feeling. One of the main factors of this film is the strong performance put on by Mickey Rourke. This film revived him and showed him with new energy. This film is one of a kind and it will please comic fans. I would strongly suggest seeing this movie if you are into comic books. This movie is two thumbs up in my eyes."

Personally my favorite was when Hartigan was sitting in the cell and JR was all yellow and he punched him in the face. I was laughing my head off. I love this movie so much. It seems like the movie I have been waiting for for my whole life. Most movies I go see I'm waiting for them to end but this movie I was hoping the next scene wasn't the last. My favorite character in the movie was Elijah Woods character who was very mystique. I beg anyone who hasn't seen this movie go see it this is the best movie of the decade. I know it wont win best picture but hopefully it will be up for some awards such as best special effects. I think that is totally awesome that this movie was made in front of a green screen. Jessica Alba looks so hot in this movie. GO SEE THIS MOVIE 100 out of 10 i know that doesn't go in 10 but this movie is that Good. Cant wait for DVD release"

","This movie was absolutely amazing. Not one bad performance, but tons of creepy ones. My favorite character had to be Dwight (played by Clive Owen). Great character and of course the coolest shoes ever. But you can't forget the gnarliest character which had to be Kevin (played by Elijah Wood). His Chucks were of unknown color (it was black and white during his scenes of course) but he still kicked ass. An amazing movie, it definitely made my top 20 of all time, but it just goes to prove that Chucks will kick your ass any day of the week. Whether your a cannibal or just a guy trying to help some girls. On a side note, has anyone heard the rumor of follow up films to Sin City? I haven't read Frank Miller's comics, but I understand that he has written quite a few and that Robert Rodruigez would definitely like to film some more. Would there be more chronicles of Dwight and Nancy? Anyone that has read Frank Miller's graphic novels please respond to this comment. I think it would be cool to continue the series, even under a different name than Sin City or even something like Sin City: Volume 2 (very Tarantinoesque I know) or something like that."

","If you don't mind terrible dialogue and only mediocre acting, then sin city is your movie. The visuals are everything that make this movie worth seeing, but a better script and acting could have made it great. Rodriguez's insistence on make a film as quickly as possible limits the actors' abilities to produce good work, and his script work is more like copying lines for detention, as the dialogue is straight from the graphic novels and that is obvious in the movie even if you haven't read them. Furthermore, the story revolves around four or five different stories which only have a connecting link of taking place in the same city, and are not interconnectable. All in all this movie is worth seeing for the use of digital film technology and Rodriguez's ability to tell an action packed story. However, the dialogue is cheese and the lack of a cohesive singular story make the movie difficult to sit through."
"Mahalie","10","1","3","4 April 2005"," Pure Style and Entertainment
","Sin City is one of the best movies you can see. This movie is full of style and is just great. Violence is not in short supply, but is done in a way where it's just perfect, for me at least. The characters are great, and you'll probably find yourself really caring about their fate. After watching for a while, you'll get sucked into this world and forget you are watching a movie. There's a large cast of names you know and each one of them seems as though they were born to play their character. Sin City was amazing in every way. The look of it was amazing, the music worked perfectly, the acting was great, and the direction and story telling where second to none. Unless you are really afraid of violence, I don't see who wouldn't like this movie. If you have not yet seen this movie, you are doing a great injustice to yourself. This is easily the best movie so far this year. Highly Recommended. 10/10"

","This was one of the coolest movies I have seen in a long time. And I must say that I am glad to see something good come of of Troublemaker Studios, because as I recall they were responsible for the Faculty, and Spy Kids. I know at least that Robert Rodriguez is responsible for those particular cinematic atrocities. But all things said, Sin City was a good movie. I really liked the fact that the film is like watching a comic book, and thought that the character development is what really made the movie so good. The movie made you actually care about the characters, which isn't something that you see so often in an action movie. Usually the character dies, and you don't care because you don't know them. Sin City was different though, it told you just enough about each character to make you want the ""good"" guys to succeed, and the ""bad"" guys to fail. That I liked. Although I'm not sure if the whole black and white thing is artsy, or just because they can't show all the blood in color. I've heard both. All things considered this was a good movie that I would recommend for action movie fans. Although you shouldn't see it if violence offends you. I don't want to spoil anything in this fantastic movie, but I'll say that it is the most violent movie I have seen in a long time."

THe cinematography was perfect when you consider the objective: to make a movie that looks like a comic. Every effect, camera angle and effect pulled this off brilliantly.<br/><br/>I won't comment on the plot because, firstly, I didn't read the original and I wouldn't want to spoil it. The characters, however, were well cast. Jessica Alba was a particularly wise choice, she is an absolute bombshell. I think my favorite character, however, is Marv. The overgrown, grisly, ugly beast who tears apart cops and thugs alike in the name of the hooker who had a heart of gold.<br/><br/>Really good stuff here. Go see it."

","I have never read the graphic novels this movie was based on so perhaps I'm at a disadvantage, but I did not enjoy this film. The look, I will admit, is eye-popping and quite enjoyable, but the content it contained was nihilistic, mean-spirited, and relentless gory. I don't mind blood and gore in my movies, I'm a big fan of Scorsese and Peckinpah, but some moderation would be nice. There were parts of the film I found just plain sick and I could not wait for it to end. It was nice, though, to see Rutger Hauer and Powers Boothe on the screen again. And Mickey Rourke was excellent. But even parts of his characters story were just sadistic. Unless you know what you're getting into, I would avoid this film."

The acting and the characters were perfect; every one of them. the score and the use of color was excellent. they way they split up the stories was awesome (in a way i definitely didn't predict). the bits of humor were great (*SPOILER?* - nicky katt after being shot with the arrow - *END OF SPOILER?*). to sum it up, i cant think of a single worthwhile complaint about this movie, and I'm done thinking about it. there were no omissions that i truly missed and i loved everything they added (very few things if any). long story short, this was the best midnight showing i have ever been to, and that includes star wars episode 1 (no contest), two towers, return of the king (i thought this would never be beaten), and spider-man 2. go see this movie, it is amazing and it is everything i could have ever dreamed it could be."

"LPnFlyz","10","1","3","1 April 2005"," Best Comic Book Adaptation into Film!
","There are so few films I have seen where I experienced thrillness, and none of them are comic book adaptations. This is the first adaptation to come as a great action thriller. This movie embodies the comic book universe of Frank Miller greatly. His hand in this project makes the film's faithfulness to the comic book lucid. The cast is full of young stars and prestigious veterans. But that is not the strongpoint of the movie, it is the great narration-- the story that Rodriguez and Miller put together that developed the cool characters. Tarantino also deserves credit for helping out his buddy, Rodriguez, and Miller. His name on the film explains the hype-ness of the movie(the dialogue is similar to Pulp Fiction's). There's more style over substance, but like I said, there is a story being told throughout the film that is equal in quality to the former. It is totally worth watching."
"A.P.","9","1","3","3 April 2005"," Brutal and powerful
","Last night, I saw what could probably be the best comic-to-film adaptation ever made (or anything-to-film adaptation possibly). I say this because it stuck to the source material verbatim. Dialouge was spot-on and the look of the characters along with the compositions of the shots directly followed what was in the original series. I think there were only two scenes cut form the film that probably should have been included for a bit more characterization, but it still remains faithful. True, this movie may still not be for everyone. It is brutal and insane. Those who don't follow film-noir may not understand the claustrophobic atmosphere and the dreariness and people who may not be comic readers may not understand the dark humor and the insane action/seeming lack of physics. Despite this, it is a modern mastic in both storytelling and effects. The story may seem hateful or cynical to some, but I would argue that it is quite the opposite. Each main character willingly walks into situations that he knows will have dire consequences, but chooses to do so anyway due to the kindness of a stranger (Marv), loyalty to friends (Dwight), or simply out of a sense of justice (Hartigan). They make sacrifices when they could simply walk away and are given the chance to do so. As for the effects, the digital green screen provides a fitting backdrop into this world while not taking too much away from the action due to the desire to shove eye-candy down our throats. Some shots seemed a bit awkward, but for the most part, it enhanced the story rather than became a distraction."

Watch it and be ready for intensity, violence, and a film noir experience that makes you happy to walk out into a normal city!! It may seem weird but despite the comic-bookiness(yep, my own word) of the characters and city, I found more depth and identification with some than I'd ever have expected. And let's face it, Clive Owen, Bruce Willis, Mickey Rourke, Jessica Alba, Rosario Dawson, Alexis Bledel, Nick Stahl and a dozen others all make it an amazing movie. Can't wait to buy it."
"DarkCloud197","Null","1","3","3 April 2005"," Hot Action Not Enough for Sin City
","SIN CITY 2.5/5 <br/><br/>Sin City is Frank Miller's on screen adaptation of the graphic novels, portraying the independent plots of three characters, living and dying in the grungy shadowed underworld of Basin (Sin) City. While some of the stylistic violence is quite an enjoyable indulgence, the gore and even the all-star cast are not enough to keep the film afloat. <br/><br/>Apart from the unoriginal and indistinguishably flat characters, Sin City's constant voice-overs are one part overworked film noir and two parts novelistic stream of consciousness-- extremely annoying to hear for two hours. And even in their heads, the thoughts aren't winners, with dry, corny lines like ""It's time to prove to your friends you're worth a damn."" And while fans of the graphic novel will love the film's scene-for-scene adherence to the comic from which it was based, the rest of us will be bored if not being disgusted at City's liquid violence. And while the violent scenes are reminiscent of the Kill Bill volumes, modern-day classics, Sin City lacks the snappy, witty dialogue of the masterful Tarantino (whose guest direction is the gun barrel-in-head scene /a publicity stunt?). The motives that lead to the bloody battles of Sin City are apparent but disappointingly uninteresting. The character's personalities and motives are never developed or justified, they're just there. Miller could have saved us all time by merging the three male leads into one walking, talking, unaffected male bad-ass stereotype. Though authentic in its translation, this comic book adaptation does not survive on its own as a FILM (like the excellent X-men and Spiderman series). However, the dark film lights a spark with its minimal characters, like Miho, a silent ninja-star and sword-smuggling killer with pin-point accuracy. Also, a light in the dark is the film's artistic cinematography. The occasional instances of color, amongst the black and white, is done very well, drawing the viewer's attention to specific aspects that contrast the gloom of Sin City-- like the dazzling yellow hair of Goldie, a prostitute and the object of Marv's affection. Here, the color scheme not only gives the film a classic feel, but it allows us as viewers to remember what the characters remember, giving us a glimpse into their personalities-- where the sappy voice-over fails."
"mileniumanimator","9","1","3","2 April 2005"," Excellent
","Immediately upon seeing the trailer for the film I thought style over substance, but was completely proved wrong after seeing the story in it's entirety. Three heroes - One using brawn, one brain, and one heart tell their stories through voice over which at first seems drowning, but lightens up and becomes quite interesting. The images go panel for panel with the comic (So I'm told) and each frame in the film is even more visually stunning than the last. Bloody, yet somewhat bizarre violence, produced a few laughs. The acting however was top of the line considering I've never heard so many cheesy lines spoken so believably. I was mesmerized with Sin City during my time there, and could recommend this film to anyone who enjoys Robert Rodriguez, Q T, comic books, originality, or just plain fun at the movies. A-"
"chief-88","7","1","3","2 April 2005"," Great adult movie
","I am just back from seeing Sin City, a movie adapted from graphic novels (for that read adult comic books) by Frank Miller. The movie was shot and edited like those graphic novels as well. Mostly in black and white with a few bright red, bright green, bright yellow and fluorescent whites thrown in to catch the eye. The whole effect worked very well I thought to focus our minds on what was important in the shot and to add to the gritty feel of Sin City. It is a real Tarrantino-esque kind of movie, lots of blood, over the top violence and semi-naked women. It is also a throwback to the old days when the anti-hero was in, these people were all bad they were just not as bad as the folks they were killing. The movie was a series of stories all loosely connected to one another by people in the periphery. I actually quite enjoyed it though I am sure it had no redeeming value at all. There were plenty of sarcastic little comments scattered throughout that made me laugh out loud and it was shot so that no one could take the violence seriously. If you liked Kill Bill you will like this I think. Tarrantino is a ""guest director"" and there were two other guys - Frank Miller & Robert Rodriguez - listed as the real directors. I highly recommend it but not for any kiddies at all"

","I loved this movie! My one gripe is , having read all of the source material, I knew exactly what was going to happen next. It's kind of like going to see a band like the Eagles who are so precise in their re-creation of a song (right down to the guitar solos) that there is no surprise left. That being said, the look and feel of the film was nothing short of astonishing and I'm more than happy to be able, finally, to ""complain"" about a film-from-comic being utterly faithful to the source material. Kevin Smith commented several years ago that the reason there weren't any really good adaptations of comic books to film was due to the studio higher-ups tinkering with a proved story to the point that it no longer resembled what had made it so popular in the first place! That is obviously not the case here and I can't wait for the sequel so I can be ""unsurprised"" some more."

For all of those who have just been initiated to Sin City...I hope you enjoyed the ride. This was by far the most accurate translation of a comic ever, staying completely true to the source material and never flinching. Screw the Director's Guild and all of the other doubters, Robert, Frank, and Quentin go this one right. If I had any complaints it would be Bruce Willis as Hartigan. I wasn't buying him as a nearly 70-year-old. It would have been perfect with Clint Eastwood. That's my only criticism. Now I can't wait to see ""Booze, Broads, and Bullets"", ""A Dame to Kill For"", and ""Hell & Back"". I hope we don't have to wait long."

","In the first scene of this movie, I thought to myself how bad the acting and dialog was. But then I realized it's reading just like a comic book, that's how the dialog reads in a comic. The acting was superb, (besides the Michael Madsen scene in the beginning)and all the way through this movie it was just like reading a comic. I can't stress how unusual this is. Spiderman? The Hulk? Even Batman were all comic books formed into a movie, and any problem those movies had it was that they weren't true enough to the comic, or that it felt too much like a movie and not enough comic. Watching Sin City is exactly like reading a comic book. It's literally a comic book on screen. Anyone who enjoyed reading comic books will absolutely love the experience of watching this movie. For those who don't or haven't read comics, just in keep mind that this is how a comic feels. This is a true comic book movie, spider man, superman, hulk, x-men, and batman might as well of not even been a comic book when you watch the movie, watch Sin City and you swear you wore turning the pages of a comic book."
"TheDuke-2","7","1","3","2 April 2005"," Visually Stunning!
","As expected this movie was as beautifully shot as I expect from Mr Rodriguez. He and Spielberg are probably the best Cameramen in the business today. Sin City was by far the ""best looking"" comic book movie to date. Mickey Rourke's performance as Marv was worth the price of admission all by it self. Now for the negative side. My only big beef with the movie is how the 3 separate stories are placed together on screen. I didn't feel the connection with the other characters like I did Marv, and I blame Frank Miller for that. He had the entire movie storyboarded out and Rodriguez followed it to the letter. As a comic book this story works, but on screen people are owed better story structure and placement. He did tie all 3 stories into the main one, but only in a cheap way. Instead of a beginning, middle and end, he worked it similarly to the ""pulp fiction"" format. Now I'll be the first one to say the Rodriguez knows more about Directing then Tarrantino ever will, however Mr T is still the dialog and story teller master which is why pulp fiction worked.<br/><br/>Overall this movie has all the visuals and violence that serious comic book movies need to get the point across. Just don't go into it hoping to get a resolution that you will be looking for."
"mvy4795","10","1","3","1 April 2005"," Watch only if you can handle the violence!
","This movie was extremely perverse in all the ways that you can ask for from Robert Rodriguez. I'm not familiar with Frank Miller's written work, but it is quite clear that he successfully presented his material on the big screen. I loved the way they began with the fluff of Hartnett's acting, only to turn a 180 and plunge heavily into the painful, grungy world of Sin City. The dialogue was minimally complex, which worked because it allowed you to focus on each licentious, lustful locale. It was a male movie-goer's paradise--babes, violence, and gore. Their appeal notwithstanding, the protagonist of every sub-plot risked his life for the women around him, no matter what the cause. And each bad guy received his comeupance.<br/><br/>Sin City used splashes of color on the black and white shots in wonderfully passionate and almost enthralling ways. The lighting was fabulous. Although shot with a late-1940's aesthetic, modern guns and the occasional modern car made their way onto the screen. The merger of these and other anachronistic elements gave the movie a setting that was without period. Even the characters were timelessly played (albeit aptly) with sass and charisma (depending on gender). This gave them a realistic depth that nicely balanced their sometimes super-human behavior.<br/><br/>For a laundry list of textural elements, I personally thought this movie was amazing."

","After watching Sin City I had the urge to reach for a cigarette in one hand and a bottle of Jack Daniels in the other.<br/><br/>For me, this is a very very good thing.<br/><br/>Simply, the action that plays in my mind while reading Frank Miller's Sin City was recorded by Robert Rodriguez and brought onto the silver screen. For moviegoers expecting a movie in the traditional vein, this masterpiece might disappoint. For all others, this might possible prove to be one of the most entertaining movie experiences.<br/><br/>Employing the story telling techniques popularized by Quentin Tarantino in his movie Pulp Fiction, Sin City revolves around the lives and stories of three central characters, presented in full comic book glory - style and all. It is this specific artistic approach that Sin City creates, which is its strongest selling point. While other adapted movies might hint mildly to its roots, Sin City is truly the art of Frank Miller, from the splashes of color to the intricate details of shadows and light.<br/><br/>Some critics might point to Sin City's more obvious flaws - its senseless violence, its lack of moral anchor, maybe even its seemingly absurd generalizations. These complaints aren't necessarily without merit, just way too serious. Avoid the ego-masturbation and just enjoy this in the making genre defining film.<br/><br/>If the lone fact that I registered an account at IMDb and wrote a review after years of lurking doesn't compel you to go give Sin City a try, then I don't know what else will.

Sin City isn't without flaws (only one I can think of is that Marv had all the bandages for the little scratches escaping, but hardly limped away from getting hit by a car a couple of times) indeed they are so minor I'm willing to overlook them.

An example of failed attempt at this is the movie ""World of the Future"", which looked terrible, since the actors in that movie just didn't look like they belonged in the background.<br/><br/>There's some extreme violence, but it's stylized, so it doesn't leave you disturbed like a horror film would.<br/><br/>The plots are pretty simply and easy to follow. The movie isn't really about plots, but it's about style. And there's lots of that. It's also about beautiful women, and Jessica Alba is the star there. It has nudity and sex, but that's nor reason to see it. If you just want sex/nudity, then there are a lot more appropriate sources.<br/><br/>Now some people won't like this film. If you dislike comics, or black&white, you'll dislike this movie. Forget completely about reality if you go to this movie.<br/><br/>So, overall I'm pretty happy with the film, and recommend it.<br/><br/>p.s. It's a comic-book people. ""Graphic Novel"" is term concocted by adult men who refuse to admit they like comic books. The movie is a comic book, and that's a good thing. Watch it."

","This movie was a real surprise, for me. Frankly, I expected another comic-book knockoff - a sort of ho-hum live anime sort of thing.<br/><br/>But this was exceptional, from the story line, to the casting, to the green-screen sequences. Using narration voice-overs, the movie retained much of the character of the film-noir classics of the 1940's, but with more action and more of an adult feel, and definitely right for this time period.<br/><br/>It was refreshing to see a movie that caused me to keep thinking about it, even after the popcorn was gone and the theater was only a dot in the rear view mirror.<br/><br/>One outcome of having seen this film is that I now intend to buy the graphic novel from which this was adapted and perhaps go through the series.<br/><br/>On a scale of 1 to 10, I'd give this a ""WOW!"""

","Raises the bar for film noir and pulp fiction. The comic book jumps out on the screen. The cast of actors is perfect casting. Ingenious cinematography. Loved every frame and every murderous action sequence. Some actors I had never seen before like Rosario Dawson and Carla Guglino who have a cool sexuality about them. Totally enjoyed Bruce Willis as the Detective and welcome back Mickey Rourke! This was my first Robert Rodriguez movie -- didn't see the Spy Kids or the Desperado series, but can see why he is compared to Tarantino, who directed one of the segments.

","Title: Frank Millers Sin City (2005)<br/><br/>Directors:Robert Rodriguez, Frank Miller and Quentin Tarantino <br/><br/>Cast: Mickey Rourke, Bruce Willis, Owen Wilson, Jamie King, Jessica Alba, Rosario Dawson, Elijah Wood, Nick Stahl, Ving Rhimes, Rutger Hauer, Michael Madsen.<br/><br/>Review: <br/><br/>When Robert Rodriguez showed up on the movie scene with his low budget fast paced El Mariachi waay back in 1993 , everyone had to turn their heads and say ""who is this crazy kid?"". The he blew everyone away so to speak with his sophomore effort Desperado and his subsequent action packed vampire fest From Dusk Till Dawn. After that he made a few kiddie films (the Spy Kids series) and a down right horrible sequel to Desperado which I wont even mention. I sort of lost a bit of faith in Rodriguez and thought he was going on a downward spiral of bad movies. But low and behold, Rodriguez is back! Sin City is a masterpiece to be reckoned withall of Rodriguez's past sins have been forgiven and forgotten, his adaptation of Millers graphic novel is visually astounding and just plain fun movie! The movie develops three of Millers graphic novels. The first one called ""That Yellow Bastard"" is about an ex-cop who is hunting down a child rapist. The second one ""The Big Fat Kill"" is about a bunch of prostitutes who accidentally kill a cop and the battle that ensues, and ""The Hard Goodbye"" which is the story of Marv, a tough guy looking for the guy who killed the girl who gave him the night of his life. All the stories deal with the darkest, dirties, raunchiest type of people on the planet and the city that they inhabit, the fictional ""Sin City"".<br/><br/>Millers graphic novels have always been filled with lots of violence and beautiful art and this film is the cinematic equivalent of his novels. I literally felt like Millers novels had jumped out of the page and come to life! Most of the images in the film are exact replicas of Millers drawings. Frank Millers art is filled with lots of black and whites and no graysand this film has managed to duplicate that look in certain areas which gives the film its unique look. So from a visual standpoint be ready to see something that you have never seen before. The use of CGI here to create the city is exceptional and adds to the style of the film. This movie is over abundant in styleand a movie like that can sometimes go the way of the dodo when it comes to story or writing. Not so here. The script adheres so closely to Millers excellent writing that you don't have to worry about this movie being ""Style over substance"" because that is not the case here. The characters are very fleshed out and very comic book like in their attitude and expressions and the situations in which these characters get themselves into could only have been concocted by the sadistic and violent imagination of Frank Miller. Robert Rodriguez who is accustomed to directing stylish and violent movies was the most suitable person to adapt Millers work, this was a match made in heaven so to speak. This is film noir the way its meant to be...dark, dirty and sinfully fun.<br/><br/>The scumbags that inhabit Sin City are brought to life by a stellar cast! Mickey Rourke as Marv is amazing. Much like Ron Perlman was born to play Hellboy, so was Rourke born to play Marv, the man on a quest for revengekilling his way to the truth. By far Mickey Rourkes story is the most fast paced of all three and the most violent and entertaining. His dialog had me cracking up every five minutes, a tough guy to the very end. I was very impressed as well with Elijah Woods character! He didn't speak a word yet he emanated pure unadulterated evil. I also loved Benicio del Toro as Jackie Boy a cop who likes to hit his girl. Man he is supposed to be a cop, but the guy had one demented look on his face! And Nick Stahl as the ""Yellow Bastard"" was awesome as well, truly repulsive in nature and look. I enjoyed very much Bruce Willis's performance as Hartigan as well. His chemistry with Jessica Alba's character was great and their story felt very genuine. Needles to say, every performance on this one was excellent...you could tell this guys where having fun when they made this movie.<br/><br/>This movie had me cheering and grinning all the wayit reminded me of the good old days when a movie being ""R"" actually stood for something! I mean, Mickey Rourkes character says it the best when he says something like ""this are the good old days, they are back, filled with blood and violence"" man, he described my feelings for the film perfectly! This is a film that deals with violence like no other! If you are squeamish, do not attempt to see this one. There's decapitationsmutilations, dismemberment's, you name it and its here.<br/><br/>An excellent, fun and entertaining film every step of the way. Robert Rodriguez, you are back in my cool book man! This movie shot straight to the top of my top ten coolest movies of all time! I know there's more Sin City stories to be told because the total of Sin City graphic novels is 7 and on this movie only three of those stories where told, so bring it on, I wouldn't mind taking another trip to Sin City...what a place!<br/><br/>Rating: 5 out of 5"
"kastellos","1","2","10","25 January 2015"," More junk from Rodriguez
","8.1 rating - you got to be kidding. This movie is simply crap. Rodriguez, as usual, relies on graphic blood, cinematographic tricks, violence, stupid people, naked breasts and buttocks (voyeurism, in general), excessive noise, stupid plots (if you can call anything a plot) etc., to attract mindless audiences that get sexually aroused by killings and loveless sex.<br/><br/>Many films rely on some of these gimmicks, but some transcend the Sin City slime pit to actually tell a story. Compare the mindless Sin City, for example, with the TV program Sons of Anarchy. SOA had its fill of breasts, buttocks and killings, but the character development and story lines were very, very good. The main characters had flaws, emotions, dark places, confusion, mixed goals, etc., all of which were translated into drama. Sin City has none of that. I shouldn't have expected more, after all, it is based on Miller graphic novels (i.e., X-rated comic books) that are sold to teen age boys seeking sexual stimulation."
"malcolmmackay224","1","2","10","30 March 2007"," Mindless violence
","I rented this movie based on the great rating it got on IMDb, without taking the time to read more than a couple of reviews. Big mistake - I hated Sin City. After an hour of extreme violence, terrible acting and little or no plot, I gave up on the movie.<br/><br/>Although I'm no fan of violence, I will watch it if the film has other merits - I enjoyed The Departed. I wasn't aware that Sin City was based on a comic series. If Sin City is at all representative of modern comics then I'm glad I gave up on comics years ago.<br/><br/>I can't remember when a movie last made such a negative impression on me. It wasn't simply a matter of disliking the movie, I really disliked Sideways, but I managed to watch the entire movie. A movie has too be really bad for me to give up on it, and Sin City certainly qualifies."
"bryanhchu","1","1","4","18 January 2018"," I just.... don't get it
","I am utterly baffled by the good response that this movie has been getting. I've never read a comic book in my life, so I can't judge the ""accuracy"" of this movie's adaptation, but if this is what the comic book is like, then I don't want to read it.<br/><br/>This movie has no substance behind it. The characters are either sex objects, action heroes, or both. There are no stakes and I had zero investment into the characters or the story. A character can get beat up, shot several times, run over by a truck, and drowned and still end up fine if they are a main character. The story is not very interesting at all, and it goes in so many random directions that I have trouble remembering what happened and why, although I have a feeling that all this was done on purpose, so as to not get in the way of the stylized action. Speaking of which...<br/><br/>The black and white with small sprinkles of color gets old fast and it reminds me why almost all movies are in color. There is nothing visually interesting done with the small amount of color that is in the movie. The action is subpar at best, and a lot of it is just straight up bad. The voiceover is seriously annoying as well. I understand that noir films are supposed to have voice over and it's an artistic choice, but it serves no real purpose in this movie. Sure, sometimes it opens a window into the protagonist's mind, but most of the time it's just describing what we already know.<br/><br/>I just can't understand the praise this movie is getting."

","Sin City portraits the harsh truth of living in a society polluted by crime and ceaseless dusk. The film is based on co-director Frank Millers graphical novel series and presented through its typical raw black-and- white perspective. The plot line has its roots in four separate sin city stories, all coloured with love as well as the sly mind of a villain. Director Robert Rodriguez along with academy winner Quentin Tarantino unloads the characters on a revenge topic, all taking place between the dark alleys of a pale concrete jungle.<br/><br/>The film is divided into six chapters were these four stories sequential make their approach. The first story set off the film by introducing The Salesman, a cold blooded assassin who uses his elegance to fulfill his contracts. The story moves on to the second one regarding John Hartigan (Bruce Willis), an ageing police officer investigating a serial child- killer on the loose with his fourth victim. Hartigan soon find out the corruption behind it all and risk his liberty to save the little girl, leaving struggling emotions on his mind. The third and fourth stories are both more focused on revenge of a loved one. We meet Marv (Mickey Rourke), chasing the murder of a prostitute and Dwight, stalking his girlfriends cruel ex-partner.<br/><br/>Occasionally the stories cross each other's paths allowing the viewer to get a more stable grip around its sometime complex concept. Outstanding details such as red blood, green eyes and blond hair embrace the scenes with curiosity and wonder, despite its dominate grey angles. Overall a film worth seeing, crammed with thrilling spirit."

","Expected so much more from this one. Sin City starts out intriguing, but in the middle gets so terrible I had to actually fast forward through parts of it and fight the urge to press stop and quit watching it. The problem, obviously, is not with the graphic presentation - it's stylish and sometimes very gory. Also gotta take note of the female cast - Jessica Alba is adorable, and others (especially Carla Gugino, to my surprise) are outright hot. But a movie isn't all about its presentation (and boobs, which are plenty here), it's also very much about the plot, and it's pretty damn awful here. The main problem are the characters and the overall goofy comicbook crap that it's based on. Mickey Rourke's ugly character throwing people like he's superpowered, Clive Owen jumping down buildings, creepy cannibalistic Elijah Wood, people surviving totally grave wounds and some ugly disgusting yellow freak are ridiculous and just plain stupid. It is impossible not to see how hard this tries to be ""noir"". with all the black-and-white colouring, constant rain or snow and never-ending inner monologues. But it tries too hard, not achieving much. What the movie lacks is a good source to be based on - maybe some detective novel, some real literature, not this comic book junk from Mr. Miller, who can hardly be called a writer. Only good thing is that now I know that I'm in no way spending money on a cinema ticket to the Dame to Kill For, despite its boob-cast now including Eva Green."

","Sin City (2005) of course is considered one of Robert Rodriguez greatest films, and one of the more well modern pieces of the 2000's decade. Sin City is most certainly not a movie for everyone. This is not the sort of cartoonesque violence that made Kill Bill wild and stylish, rather Rodriguez, Miller and Tarantino ('guest director') show a much more darker and grittier world of violence that is dominated in black in white, with only the odd emphasis of color.<br/><br/>The entire cast of Sin City really come to the fore, with Owen and Willis in particular standing out and making the gritty neo-30's gangster dialog come to life. The environment is fantastic and one can only applaud Rodriguez for the time he has taken to recreate the atmosphere of Miller's novels. The plot is actually 3 stories- all loosely connected with one another. Bruce Willis stars in the first one as Hartigan; a cop whose early retirement plans are cut short due to a combination of his own obsessions with justice and his partner Bob (Michael Madsen); only to find his obsession later on all grown up in the form of Jessica Alba and his nemesis still alive in the form of what can only be described as something seen to be believed. Mickey Rourke in the second story plays Marv, a convict who is determined to get to the bottom of who killed a hooker that spent the night with him. This perhaps sees one of the most interesting performances of the movie in the form of Elijah Wood, who after Frodo Baggins, plays Kevin, a cannibalistic stalker. Finally there's Dwight (Clive Owen) who attempts to help protect the 'sisters' of Old Town led by Gail (Rosario Dawson) from the mob and bent cops.<br/><br/>The entire cast of Sin City really come to the fore, with Owen and Willis in particular standing out and making the gritty neo-30's gangster dialog come to life. The environment is fantastic and one can only applaud Rodriguez for the time he has taken to recreate the atmosphere of Miller's novels. We have all been long awaiting the heavily anticipated sequel and we are pleased that it will finally be released later this year. ==================================================================== ======= After a rewatch 06/30/17' Sin City remains a very dark, gritty and entertaining stylish watch. The movie is over two hours long but with each story, it flows by very quickly and becomes an overall great watch. The tone of the film remains what stands out, with the actors portraying their parts greatly."

","When Frank Miller started doing Sin City the comic, he was already past his prime. Gone was the political paranoia in favour of big drama. His comic work was always what you'd call cinematic, anyhow, so no surprises that they turned this to a movie. The problem is that what you'd see in the comic and think it was OK, say, a comic rendition of a slow motion scene culminating in a big one-page drawing, in the movie it works the opposite way: it exposes it for the cinematic cliché that it is. Essentially this is a quasi-cartoon tribute to film noir, too reliant on dramatic bombast. Frank Miller should take a look back to his roots (Ronin, Elektra Assassin, The Dark Knight Returns) in case he rediscovers what it was that made him special in the comic universe."

The half is Josh Hartnetts story, we don't get to see the full part. Story one is Mickey Rourke as Marv, The big tough guy. This is a Non stop Enjoyable story that kicks ass. My favourite of the trio, Mickey gives a Splendin performance. The Second story is with Clive Owen and the fight between corrupt cops and Hookers. Some great Samurai fight scenes in this story and also entertains. The third story is Bruce Willas and his fight against the paedophile. Another Great story, all courtesy of Frank Millers Sin City. Robert Rodriguez has given us great movies like Desperado, From Dusk till Dawn and Faculty. This is one of his Best work.

It is the first time i see Mickey Rourke acting, since 91/2 weeks and he was amazing, perfect for the part, he did a great job. Bruce Willis was nothing brilliant. the atmosphere of the movie is great and the way the handled the graphic line was very interesting. i don't think you have ever seen another movie like this. Even though it has some things that are used in almost every movie, it is the way they present it and the twists that make this film unique.

But yet they sometimes fit in together. Like Marv is in the bar watching Nancy and another character in another storyline is also there and that particular scene is in both story lines but it is seen from the eyes of the other character.

","There's a tradition in Edinburgh called 'Secret Cinema'. Each year, on of the art house cinemas hosts a season of seminal cult films after midnight, away from the main auditorium, in a private area that can only be entered via the back door. Cinephiles, appropriately garbed like French New Wave followers, crowd in to share the secrets. Watching selected surprise movies from yesteryear, there are 'oooohs' and 'aaaarhs' as the little known milestones in cinematic history and recognised, together with the palpable influence they have exerted in the years since their release. The audiences are always very discerning and appreciative.<br/><br/>I can imagine seeing Sin City in such a setting. Packed rows marvelling at the aesthetic technological achievement, no less than the transmuting of distinctive comic strip characters into the speech, movements and situations of on-screen actors. I can imagine looking back over the intervening years since it had been released and seeing how filmmakers have learnt new approaches from this film, how in crasser hands each one of its tiny gems has been amplified into Oscar-winning blockbusters, how in film schools the methods have been critically observed and handed down.<br/><br/>Except Sin City is not a blast from the past - it is out now, and with considerable fanfare.<br/><br/>The buzz surrounding it should not persuade you to go out and see the film unless the content and methodology attract you - Sin City might be mainstream, but only just - and it would be better to describe it as adult art-house mainstream / thriller / crime with added big names.<br/><br/>Firstly, the themes are as adult as the comic strip it is adapted from. Sin City, whether taken as a metaphor or an actual (if fictitious) place, is hardly a place for the feint-hearted. Basically it's a specialist movie in the heavy, mysterious film-noir mould, with almost constant voice overs and hard-boiled one-liners like some old Bogart films. Only it doesn't shrink from mutilation, castration, cannibalism or a host of other monstrosities. That we are aware of the mythological-like nature of the comic-strip characters doesn't completely detract from the stomach-churning inspired by such things, or from the genuinely moving scenes.<br/><br/>Saying it contains heroes is maybe going too far. Some characters are just a bit more sympathetic than others. Like the exceedingly ugly Marv. He's been framed for murder and the cops are in on it. He spends most of the film semi-deranged, searching for the one woman he loves, a whore who showed him a few moments of kindness and for whom he would do anything, including laying down his life. Or Hartigan. He's a cop, one of the ones with a shred of decency left in him. He risks his life to rescue a child from being raped and mutilated. Or Dwight. He dispenses some rough justice to a rather nasty and well connected gangster. Then there's Gail. She heads a women's prostitute cooperative that includes silent martial arts expert Miho and several Amazonian types kitted out in leather and carrying Exceedingly Powerful Guns. That's just the good guys. On the other side there's Yellow Bastard, deformed by treatment to try and restore the manhood, and who uses his victims for sexual titillation before framing their heads in the wall like sophisticated African trophies. A filthy minded Priest (less said about him the better) and Jackie Boy who 'never hits a woman' (or so he claims before he beats the sh*t out of his girlfriend). Or Becky, the dumb trinket-slinging whore that you would be better off not getting out of the car to speak to.<br/><br/>Visually, the film is a bit like a comic strip with spot-colour in a half-world somewhere between 'reality' and artifice. In previous comic adaptations, the likes of Marvel heroes, Batman and Superman are fleshed out to be 'real' people and the audience is simply asked to accept the extra level of suspension-of-disbelief: In Sin City, the characters live in a murky underworld (L.A. a few years from now??) but, for all their apparent reality, will spin the wheels of a car or defy the odds in exactly the same way that a comic strip character would - simply because it looks cool. The effect is quite remarkable, and identifies the uniqueness of the comic strip as an art form probably better than any movie before. Sin City is less a comic strip turned into a movie than an homage to the comic strip genre.<br/><br/>The finely tuned use of things like spot colour are also brought to magnificent effect. Standing on a balcony at night-time, colours are faded out, only slightly more than they would be naturally at that time, yet the red of the heroine's lipstick is saturated, quite appropriately - as you may have guessed, the morality of Sin City is one where women are women and men are men (or horrible caricatures of one or the other) and there's lots of dodgy chivalry but no-one sitting on the fence. The overall colour sense throughout is one of the things that sticks with you, like the constant rain. Sin City works as a piece of art and as sophisticated entertainment. It is no wonder that it has lost none of what must have been the intensity of the original, due in part no doubt to the presence of author Frank Miller as co-director. Other big names awash - Tarantino as guest director, Bruce Willis, Mickey Rourke, Jessica Alba, Clive Owen, Rutger Hauer, and Benicio Del Toro leading the action. For director Robert Rodriguez it is surely the most mature and compelling film to date. As Sin City 2 is still only pre-production, the best answer is to see this film at least once and then see it again - on the small screen it just won't be the same."

","""Sin City"" paints a world where power corrupts, where the beating heart of a city, represented by the Roark clan, has corrupted absolutely. In this amped-up noir vision given us by comic book legend Frank Miller, and directors Robert Rodriguez (""Desperado,"" ""Once Upon a Time in Mexico"") and Quentin Tarantino (""Pulp Fiction,"" ""Kill Bill""), the highest levels of political and religious authority conceal a seedy darkness that would make your skin crawl. Here in ""Sin City,"" there are no angels. Only weathered mortals who walk a line between virtue and evil that is as hopelessly grey as the cinematography.<br/><br/>""Sin City"" spins a trio of crime-related tales: Detective Hartigan (Bruce Willis), a good cop with a bad ticker, closes in on a serial child rapist whose father is the powerful Senator Roark (Powers Booth). Marv (Mickey Rourke), a hulking, pill-popping ex-con with a face even a mother would have trouble loving, wakes up after a one-night stand to find himself beside a dead blonde. Framed for her murder, Marv embarks on a mission, leaving a trail of pulverized (or worse) bodies in his wake. Lastly, another jailbird, Dwight (Clive Owen), finds himself a victim of circumstance, caught up in a war between the leather-bound female commandos of a liberated red light district, and a bone-crushing mobster named Manute (Michael Clarke Duncan), who makes Marv look puny by comparison.<br/><br/>Frank Miller's graphic novel series of the same name is one of the most popular non-superhero comics of the last decade-and-a-half. I assume Rodriguez is a big fan, given how involved he reportedly wanted Miller to be. A great deal of care and reverence has clearly been lavished upon the completed film. ""Sin City"" the movie includes much of Miller's particular hard-boiled speak, a large percentage of it presented as voice-over, a technique faithful to the source material.<br/><br/>""Sin City"" the graphic novel used a lot of monologue blurbs. Translating it to voice-over is essential since Hartigan, Marv, and Dwight are each the strong, silent type. If the audience couldn't get into their heads, it's doubtful they'd be able to get a feel for the characters. The movie would be boring as a result of that emotional distance. Worse, viewers would be denied such witty banter as, ""Hit men No matter what you do to them, you never feel bad about it afterward,"" and ""Take down Senator Roark. Yeah, right. Maybe after I've performed that little miracle, I'll go punch out God."" Artistically, nothing I have seen compares to this movie. There are shots, such as Marv leaping feet-first down a stairwell from an above perspective, which look like they could have been lifted directly from a comic book. Another shot, Detective Hartigan from the waist up in the midst of a snowstorm, could be either a comic book panel or a sequence in a Hitchcock film. The black-and-white cinematography by jack-of-trades Rodriguez is wonderful throughout, as far as setting a mood. In the rankings of modern black-and-white cinematography, it's a close second behind Roger Deakins' work in ""The Man Who Wasn't There."" Deakins' work seemed slightly crisper, but maybe that's because ""Sin City"" was done entirely with digital camera, in front of green screens (Rodriguez' specialty).<br/><br/>""Sin City"" was an extremely violent comic book. In adapting it for the screen, a lot of the violence, including beatings, characters being shot multiple, multiple times, limbs and organs being ripped off, was retained. The end result: A movie that ranks up there with Tarantino's ""Kill Bill"" flicks, and Frank Miller's screenplay for ""Robocop 2,"" for most variety of methods for damaging the human body. Luckily, Miller and Rodriguez each show the soul of an artist as well as a sadist. They soften some of the worst violence in the movie by: (a) having it done offscreen, (b) using visual trickery to make it less realistic-looking, and (c) implementing black humor..."
"nanelikek","10","1","4","12 May 2005"," new masculinity remakes the old honor- a feminist movie in the midst of all the balls and blood
","this movie is amazing as probably all the commentators have noted so far. the cast, the lights, the cuts, the ambiance, the directing. Here though I want to talk about gender in the story. so a boring plot line sort of comment, this one.<br/><br/>all the stories are about men who want to rescue women out of some trouble. and these men come in the guise of undesirable qualities such as the violence and utter ugliness of marv, the old age of harrigan.. then these men fight other men who have done wrong in the male code of honor. they have hurt or tried to hurt women. so what we see is these ugly, violent men who take on other men in violent ways only in order to do something chivalrous in the midst of all this sin. they are like princes who rescue their princesses. these other men such as the cannibal, the child rapist, and the wife beater are sort of like their alter-ego as we see very clearly in the car scene where benicio del toro's head talks to clive owen. but the point is despite all their confusions these men end up delivering to the women they love. and they do this even though none of them can ever be together with them, either because of age, character, social status, or the simple reason of their sweethearts being dead.<br/><br/>and what do women do? they give gifts. for instance whitey coming as goldie in the last night of marv is such a heartwarming story. nancy's letters are the same. what is ultimately interesting is that this ultimately banal gender relationship of gift giving versus protection is taken to such a primal level that it allows women the space to protect themselves. women can build their own armies, they can do plots, they can kill, they are lesbians, they spy, and of course ironically they can also become housewives and be beaten up. but all in all, in the midst of this excess of violence and masculinity it is possible to see the rise of a new masculinity actually quite toned down in its male centredness.<br/><br/>the only place that this masculinity, the masculinity of the three heroes has excess is in violence. but then again that is coded as pure lust. they love killing like they love making love to women. and they kill the bad guys and love the women. women love them back but their actions do not have to be bound them. I don't know i really liked this deal. and enjoyed it. I know it is weird to find something so feminist in such a decidedly masculine movie. but i did."

","Sin City (2005) was a complete surprise for me. When I went to go see this movie I thought it would be okay. I was in for a shock! The film-noir style and the sporadic uses of the primary colors was true eye candy. If video and computers are to be used in film making then this is what they're for! Film makers Robert Rodriguez and Frank Miller should be given the glad hand for successfully bringing their visions to the silver screen. But the real star of the show is Mickey Rouke, his performance was so powerful that he almost wins back his cool points that he won (and lost) during the 80's.<br/><br/>The all star cast really put in some effort into this production. No disappointments here (except the middle story dragged in places). I can't wait until the next film hits the theaters!<br/><br/>Highly recommended!"

How REVOLUTIONARY! More like pathetic.<br/><br/>As for the color/ special effects, hats off to computers. But I've been there done that. Let's see...Pleasantville did it better, Schindler's List was much more meaningful, and movies like Amelie make use of color MUCH better.<br/><br/>So for American audiences...congratulations welcome to a world already discovered. A moving comic adaption so true to its graphic novel form?! I can make pictures talk on my computer too. This movie is a mere TRANSLATION of the work of Miller. There is nothing new in a TRANSLATION, on a mirror-image or a reflection. There was no creative input and Miller is no amazing writer, he plays to things that so extreme, we can't help but discuss them as being, ""BOLD AND REVOLUTIONARY"" It means nothing if you contradict the norm or status quo, you are still slave to it just as pop culture is. It's pathetic eye candy that does nothing to expand American cinema.<br/><br/>The only reason I gave this movie a 5/10 was because of the promise it holds in computer graphics, which has more promise than the direction and acting in this movie combined."
"EmperorNortonII","8","1","4","16 April 2005"," No Saints In Sin City
","""Sin City"" is as faithful a rendition of the graphic novel series by Frank Miller as one could ask for. The movie is patterned directly after the comic itself. Frank Miller himself co-directed with Robert Rodriguez, and even has a cameo as a corrupt priest. The stories of the movie are set in Basin City, a dark and stormy town full of thugs, good cops and bad, righteous prostitutes, corrupt titans, and the dregs of humanity. It's all presented on screen in black and white with a few splashes of color here and there. The movie is loaded with violence, with blood flowing in four colors. And there are lots of unforgettable characters, such as Detective Hartigan (Bruce Willis), a hard-boiled cop out to protect innocent exotic dancer Nancy (Jessica Alba); Mickey Rourke as Marv, a plug-ugly anti-hero; Elijah Wood as a creepy cannibal; as Devon Aoki as Miho, a whoring assassin. The sight of characters being harmed in so many ways may be too harsh for some viewers. But the art direction is worth seeing, and its faithfulness to the original source material must be respected."
"jvolak","10","1","4","6 April 2005"," What a great visual adaptation...
","I have only glanced at Miller's books, but even with that small taste, I will say this is one of the BEST spot-on translations of an Author's material I have ever witnessed. Stunningly mesmerizing, the black and white used in the film made me feel as though I was IN the novel, and for that, I am grateful! I have heard many people talk about how the movie has ""no plot"", and how it jumps around...these people need more imagination, and also need to realize that this is actually THREE separate, yet intertwined stories all happening at the same time. The Josh Hartnett parts are from a collection of short stories that Miller did, and those are nicely placed... SIN CITY gets a 10 from me, for look, adaptation, and excellent casting by the way...every actor/actress chosen for the parts in this movie do a GREAT job of bringing to life the characters from the books! GO SEE IT!!!"

","In one word this movie can be described as unbelievable, violent, and breathtaking. Reverberates Tarantino and brilliance. The subtlety of the colors ads to the poster-like quality of nearly every scene in the movie. By far the most captivating quality of the movie is the screenplay and script. Every quote is delivered with meaning and the movie actually inspires...for better or worse. Despite the extremely graphic depiction of violence, the younger generations will absolutely love this movie. Sin City strives to be something more than the typical Hollywood action flicks..it succeeds. In one of the most original and ingenious works of art, this movie is a new step in cinema."

","Yeah. Amazing movie. Some people are prudish about all the violence, but come on, it's Robert Rodriguez for cryin out loud. All of his bleeding movies are violent. But this movie impressed the hell out of me. I didn't know he had it in him to make such an inventive, creative, visually stunning movie that still had an amazing plot; my hat's off to him. It's been a very long time since I've been so awe-struck by the directing, cinematography, writing AND acting of a film.<br/><br/>I've never seen Mickey Rourke in a cooler role. I've never been so turned off (but still impressed) by Benicio Del Toro. I've never been so happy to see the return of a ""has-been"" as I was when I saw Rutger Hauer. I've never been so intrigued by Clive Owen or kind of turned on by Bruce Willis (older men: cheers!). I've never seen a movie where a character is yellow, everyone has a gun and blood is white where I actually ended up taking the damn thing seriously. And I never thought I would see Devon Aoki in a role where I could even STAND the broad, let alone seriously raise my glass to her. And come on: you know a movie is something worth saluting when you can sit there and be absolutely terrified of Elijah Wood! Frodo, for chr!st's sake! The whole thing with the cannibalism and the long fingernails and the eating of a woman's fingers...wow. Wow. Go see this movie. See it now. See it seventeen times. If you don't like artsy directing, you'll love the fantastic acting of the impressive ensemble cast, and if you're sick of movie violence, maybe you'll at least be enlightened to see it doled out in a whole new way.<br/><br/>If you aren't impressed or at least leaving the theater admitting how different and totally unique this movie is, well then I guess you had your hands over your eyes from all the gore, in which case I urge: butch up, Susie Q!"

","When I saw the previews for this film I knew already that this film was going to be unique and distinct from the other films released this year. I was right.<br/><br/>The film combines 1940s film noir with Tarantino-type story-telling (which is appropriate, since he is a guest director). The beginning is a little slow, and I found the dialogue between Willis' and Madsen's characters the only shortfall. After that, it all went furiously uphill.<br/><br/>Car chases, gun fights, blood-splatter, even the age-old toilet dunking bit appear picturesque and sublime in black and white ""graphic"" film(with a few occurrences of color here and there).<br/><br/>This is an incredible film, with an intoxicating story, wicked humor and genuine talent from the cast (even Jessica Alba shines)."

It is an incredible display of blood lust and chaos in a setting that would encompass everything a Sin City would be. With it's film noir mood, extreme violence, comedic quips, and black & white settings with splashes of color for affect, it is an amazing story of morality gone awry. The writing, acting, photography and directing are all top Notch. It has Quinton Tarrentino Esq format with story lines bouncing around, but ties in all of them perfectly.

Robert Rodriguez has repented from any bad movies he might've done in the past (>COUGH!< Spy Kids 3-D!) by making this gorgeous film. Everybody should see this movie!

","After reading Sin City for years and then seeing this film I was amazed at the accuracy of the film to the novel. Pick up one of Frank Miller's books after watching Sin City and then compare the shots in the film to the story boards of the book. They are guaranteed to be the same. Even the words spoken are straight from the book. This is by far the best film based off of a comic book/graphic novel yet! I've seen them all. This is totally up in the 10's with the like, Hellboy, Superman, Batman, Dick Tracy and Blade. This is not another Catwoman or Daredevil mush up with all new costumes. It's not a teaser like Spider-man (where he shoots webbing from his wrist) and it is certainly not an over-the-top rip of an artistic comic like Batman and Robin was. I've seen many films based on comics and there are a lot of them, look them up some time, but Sin City is the best."
"snowboarderbo","10","1","4","4 April 2005"," It really doesn't get much better than this, folks
","I am a big fan of the comic and of the early Rodriguez film El Mariachi (which I thought was a better film than the bigger-budget Desperado), and watching this film was amazing. It isn't a movie of a comic book, it's a comic book on the movie screen.<br/><br/>Uncompromising, gritty, rough, brutal, hardcore: both Sin City the place and Sin City the movie are all these things and more. This film transcends not one but two mediums, bringing film-making as an art back into the public consciousness and, like American Splendor did last year, showing that comic books can be ART.<br/><br/>No tired re-hash of a Hollywood hit from yesteryear, Sin City is so fresh, so different, so goddamn exciting that I could scarcely stand to glance away. Frank Miller is an exceptionally talented artist whose visual acumen has fascinated me for years (since his Batman days), and Robert Rodriguez proves himself an equally formidable director, not just for conceiving how this film should be brought to the cinema, but for executing it so brilliantly.<br/><br/>A series of short stories, intertwined and criss-crossing pulp fictions, seemingly unrelated at first, until we discover, like the characters in the film, more and more details about each situation. Through excellent writing and choice of narrative structure, Miller and Rodriguez engage the viewer to become a detective as well, tracking leads, gathering information right alongside our protagonists, putting the pieces together with them. In the end, though, we are richer because we have more details and more questions, and our imaginations allow us to continue to explore the stories we have just seen after the projector stops. A good film, a good comic, all good art should engage the viewer's imagination, force them to fill in gaps, to think about what they are seeing, and Sin City certainly has that.<br/><br/>Amazing performances (Michael Madsen's terse, first-grader-reading-aloud delivery excepting), captivating images, and multiple intertwined cross-crossing story lines kept me entranced for more than 2 hours. I know that repeated viewings will bring more out of this film too; there is no way to have seen all the details in these compositions in one viewing.<br/><br/>My only dread would be the dilution of this work thru repetition. If sequels should occur, I hope that Mr. Miller and Mr. Rodriguez remain as demanding and uncompromising as Sin City itself, and that future works expand on the vision and possibilities which they have presented to us.<br/><br/>Good job, guys.<br/><br/>Bo"
"riddilnc","8","1","4","4 April 2005"," Worth $7 and 2 hours, but not much more
","I fully understand how fans of the movie can immediately jump to give the movie a 9 or 10 star rating. However, I'm a bit shocked that there isn't much of a voice on the other side of the ratings scale.<br/><br/>The movie was enjoyable. It was entertaining. In spending $7 for the ticket I am confident that I got my money's worth. While the movie is avant-garde, the translation from page to screen wasn't performed seamlessly. There are several points in the movie where the digital effects required to rend a 2D image into a 3D set distract the viewer, pulling them out of what is intended to be an immersive experience. A still-shot of any of these scenes would surely be awe-inspiring, but in motion it simply looks manufactured. This isn't a fatal flaw by any means, but any time a movie reminds you that you're watching a recording of actors in front of a blue-screen, instead of a view into an alternate reality, it serves to make the experience less rewarding. (For an example just think back to your viewing experience of Star Wars ep 1, or Lost in Space).<br/><br/>The acting in the movie is a shining point. For most of the scenes the actors were dropped onto an empty set, in front of a blue-screen, with no other actors to interact with. This movie truly served to show the depth of the actors chosen for this movie.<br/><br/>Anyhow, to wrap this up: the movie was good. It's worth the few bucks to see it in the theatre instead of on the small screen. But this movie is no ""Wizard of Oz"" that will change the face of Hollywood."

","For starters, I have been a Frank Miller fan since Daredevil and Dark Knight. I don't really think that Sin City is his best work but I always thought it would make a cool movie. with that out of the way, I enjoyed the film very much and give it (as a movie) 8 out of ten stars. i've always enjoyed films that transport you to another place by creating a universe unto itself. it reminds me of ERB novels of Tarzan when i read them as a child. but I digress. I'm a bit surprised that the acting was as good as it was. Mickey Rourke floored me as Marv and Benicio Del Toro as Jackie boy was equally as good. the problem with this is that the great acting exposed some of the weaker performances in the film such as Jessica Alba's Nancy: she was surely hot and FM has never really fleshed out her character, but she seemed flat. for the most part though, all the actors did what they could with the source material. the violence will probably turn some moviegoers off (even in todays desensitized society) and it's always more shocking to see a violent act then to read it, albeit in a graphic novel, but it is what it is. I look forward to the DVD and seeing each story in its entirety because the originals were so economically written that to cut anything is detrimental to the story as a whole. the visuals of the film were gorgeous of course and unlike anything we have seen on the screen before. color was only used only as an exclamation point, how Frank Miller intended. the score was simple and unobtrusive, ( I particularly liked the piano in That Yellow Bastard) it did not distract and only added to the bleak visuals. Robert Rodriguiez has accomplished what he set out to do: pay homage to Frank Miller and experiment with his craft therein turn the movie-making industry on its head.<br/><br/>done and done. congratulations to Robert and Frank for a job well done.<br/><br/>and there is one thing i've learned from this adaptation: no matter how faithful you are to the book, the book will still (and always) be better."
"wspears49","Null","1","4","3 April 2005"," Interesting but repetitive
","Unlike many reviewers, I have never read any of Frank Miller's graphic novels--so I can't comment on the authentic look of the film. I can say that the film is visually stunning, particularly given that so much of what you see is digitally created. It is truly a work of art to behold.<br/><br/>I can also say that the characters are all uniformly interesting to watch. Not just the characters made up prosthetically, like Micky Rourke as Marv, or Elijah Wood as Kevin. Every major actor is playing a singularly interesting character, and the interaction between those characters is compelling to watch, just as compelling as the visuals.<br/><br/>But for me, the problem is that, both the characters and the look of the film, are at the service of essentially the same story, told three separate times.<br/><br/>Possible mild spoilers.<br/><br/>The stories are all about cruelty and retribution, with some form of redemption at the end. Each story plays out like an Old Testament tale, which is alright for the first hour or so. But after a while, all the over-the-top violence and histrionics begin to wear you down. By the second hour, the movie has become predictable, and that's as deadly, in a movie, as any shot through the head.<br/><br/>Critics keep referring to Sin City as a return to Film Noir. <br/><br/>But great film noir, like Out of the Past and The Big Sleep, have a lot of elements to it besides violence. Sex, for instance. With femme fatales, who the antihero and the audience don't know if they can trust--and that creates suspense. <br/><br/>There are numerous women in Sin City--in fact women are the catalyst for each of the stories. But there's not much suspense surrounding who these women are, and what they might be up to. And except for the prostitute gang, the women we meet in Sin City are all ladies in distress--hardly what I expected to find going in to the film.<br/><br/>In the end, the only suspense in Sin City is what new and bloody way someone can get his head bashed in.<br/><br/>I would certainly recommend seeing Sin City. It is dazzling to look at, even more so than Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow. I just wish that the story telling had kept up with the visual look of the film and the character creation."

","I like comic books. I think they are beautiful pieces of art but where sticking to the book literally helps some stories i.e. LOTR (and even Peter Jackson new that some creative license was needed) the director of Sin City should have thought more about the possible audience for his film. I stories would have been good just in and of themselves without the naked women, endless violence and voice over. The characters were also interesting but if appealing to a wider audience is a consideration then sticking with the comic book violence and sex is a no, no. This film should as it stands if for seventeen year old boys who can't get real women and play hour after hour of ultra-violent video games. And since I'm not one of those I was disappointed."

","I have watched Kill Bill (both I and II), and I was totally blown away by the gory violence and artistic style in Sin City.<br/><br/>It is absolutely filled with constant lustful desires and killing blood. Of course, like many other reviewers mentioned, this movie is violent to an extreme. However, it does come with a certain amount of humors, so you won't be stressed with seeing blood the whole time.<br/><br/>Certain physics in this movie are under question. For example, when Marv was hit by a car multiple times, he seems to be unharmed (not even a broken bones). Not to mentioned when he got shot so many times in the chest, ..and endured electrocution twice before being dead (or so we are made to believe). That's freaking unbelievable! My last concern was that it may be nice if they include a time line for the events happened in the movie. In fact, there is a 8+ years of time span within the movie (from the time Nancy was saved to the time she is saved again at age of 19), and if you aren't careful, you can get quite lost indeed until the very end. Perhaps, that was meant to be. Fortunately, it is not too hard for general movie goers to piece together all the puzzles.<br/><br/>Overrall, an excellent movie. If they do right on DVD, I may also get it too :)"
"lkh2006","7","1","4","3 April 2005"," worth thinking about
","I've never read the graphic novels, so I can't comment on how the film relates to them, except in the sense of disjunction--this film doesn't feel like it holds together, as it has no unified story. Thus, it can get long and, as it is on screen rather than on paper, it would have benefited from more continuity in story as well as in feeling.<br/><br/>What it has, however, is a unified sensation--morality, if such a word fits in this world. The fact that the movie begins and ends with an assassin killing (or about to kill) a woman who (certainly in one case and probably in the other) has broken the rules and betrayed her sisters and the code of the city is significant. In a world in which sin touches every person, no one emerging unscathed, the definitions of right and wrong, good and evil, may blur but exist nonetheless. You have your evil rapists, your soul- and flesh-eating monsters, and you have those who kill to revenge a wrong or to protect a way of life that guarantees some degree of freedom. The thing is that all of these people enjoy the killing; in this world, you have to or are part of that small group that doesn't fit and is targeted or desperate because of it. You have those that aren't a part of it or who don't enjoy the violence--you have Nancy and Becky, the first someone to protect as much as possible, the second someone who doesn't fit, seemingly more ""normal"" yet also the biggest femme fatale--the biggest simply because those around her would never think it of her--of the story.<br/><br/>The movie is unapologetically violent and explicit, but that's the context of this world: it isn't gratuitous, it's characterization--innocence does not exist. The little girl Hartigan tries to save grows into a stripper--still targeted because she's different--who is not as hard as many of those around her but is still tainted by this world--she grew up strong, and in this city, that means, among other things, taking some part in the events we see. Goldie, idolized by Marv, is one of the band of hookers who run part of town--she seeks help and comfort but is by no means pure. Even Alexis Bledel's character, whose eyes glow in a pure blue and who, despite her profession, exudes innocence, ends up being the one who betrays the code, a darker sin in this city, no matter the reason--do we forgive her betrayal, understanding her desire to get out of this world, or, because no one escapes, do we condemn her? The color added to the depiction of these last two characters is striking and important, for they are in some way different, for better or for worse, and both end up dead, also significant. Here, innocence is scarce, weak, false, or nonexistent, and that, for me, is the most interesting part of the film. In the contrast between A) the powerful, evil villains, B) the gun-toting hookers and the testosterone-charged heroes, and C) the tainted innocents of the film is the point.<br/><br/>I'm still working out what that point is, but the film speaks, nonetheless. It's worth seeing, but it is disturbing and shocking in its grit--there's no romanticized beauty here--or what little there is is tarnished--but there's much to see."

","Damn, if SIN CITY doesn't look like SIN CITY! - the movie like the book that is. I haven't been as big a fan of Frank Miller's art as much as his writing, but I oddly hoped that the film would capture the look of the comics, and in that regard it triumphs. Marv and Bratigan are big and blocky, Shellie and Nancy are curvy and angular, and the city itself becomes a character, especially on those rain driven nights when a comic book splash page takes on new meaning in a driving rain storm.<br/><br/>And it's not just the black and white noir-ishness of the film; this movie's black and white POPS!, along with the surreal color splashes added for nuance and contrast. The eye goes where it must, whether the fire engine red of Goldie's dress or the sickening hue of ""That Yellow Bastard"".<br/><br/>Kudos to Director Robert Rodriguez for defying convention and resigning from the Director's Guild when threatened over Frank Miller's inclusion as Co-Director, and Quentin Tarantino's contribution as a guest director. Movie making can use more of this type of creativity. Ultimately quality speaks.<br/><br/>Every once in awhile a film comes along that breaks new ground and sets the bar for those that follow - SIN CITY is such a film, just as ""Star Wars"", ""Aliens"" and ""Pulp Fiction"" were in their respective genres. And for fans of comic books and graphic novels, this film will be THE one to top, and that won't be for a while, if ever. ""Road to Perdition"" was a successful transfer of story to screen, ""Sin City"" is a masterful transformation of the drawn and printed panel come to life. SEE IT!<br/><br/>Added bonus: Frank Miller as the priest hearing confession!!! That was so cool!"

","Ummm...I just saw it tonight, and to say I am disappointed is an understatement. I have read all the graphic novels, and when I saw the first preview a few months ago I nearly wet my pants. Maybe it was the anticipation, or maybe I went in with unreasonable expectations, but this flick blew me away with how incredibly horrible it was. Lets make a list: bad acting? check. repetitive scenes? check. long spells of mind-numbing boredom? of course. The worst part was the thing I was most looking forward to: the narration. After about a half-hour I was wishing Bruce, Mickey and Clive would shut up. Lastly, for some reason I didn't have a problem with it in the graphic novel, but in the movie every scene with the 11 year-old Nancy Callahan made me want to get up and leave the theater. I felt like I was watching kiddie-porn. Overall, this was probably the worst experience I have had at the movies since my sister made me watch Hairspray(it's not my fault, I was 10). All the fanboys out there may crucify me, but I call em like I see em."

"dumoonews","10","1","4","2 April 2005"," Go see ""Sin City""
","Been waiting on this movie for over a year. Saw it twice today and I still don't know if it was worth the hype. Two shows, the 12:05 where only the junkies were there and 7:35 where the usual crowd was there to view their Friday movie. It was interesting seeing the two crowds. The followers went to the first show to see it as soon as possible and knew exactly what they were in for. They sat there silent watching, unlike the second group. First thing I saw when I walked into the cine the second time was a kid that couldn't have been more then 9 there with his father. I couldn't believe it, I was ready to say something to the father. They sat through the whole thing, I expected him to be dragged out by his father within minutes, but they stayed. Others left, this is a pretty disgusting movie we're talking about. Right around the ax scene people were dropping like flies.<br/><br/>Anyway, great movie. I was expecting more, yes. After all I've hyped it up I expected the next Star Wars. The visuals went from impressive to just plain cheap in seconds at times, but were good overall. I didn't like the order it was shown to us in. Sure, it had that Pulp Fiction thing going on with it's being out of sequence and Hartigan's story was great being sliced into two different parts of the movie, but the whole thing took away from Marv. Mickey Rourke was the man in this movie, but it was weakened by the other parts in the movie. He's got the first spot for his whole story right after two shorts right in the beginning, and then he's gone. He's back for a short time right near the end due to the sequence, but just barely. I think a lot of people there may have forgotten the whole segment due to The Big Fat Kill and That Yellow Bastard (who is VERY yellow by the way, especially when put put against other characters in black and white). That segment was amazing, enough to bring Rourke back to the top but it was rushed into the beginning and he was killed off as to pave the way to bigger and better parts of the movie (which are NOT bigger or better). It was a shame. Nothing was cooler then the very beginning. There was the whole ""oh snap, we screwed up, let's fix it"" segment and the touching cop/father figure segment with a creepy yellow dude (who wasn't accepted very well, the audience just didn't get it.). There's also two other short segments in which NOBODY but me got. I thought it would have been obvious, but I had to explain it to people. I won't spoil it, I'll just say that it was a brilliant twist and a great end to the movie. It's a love it or hate it kinda movie. I appreciate the style and direction of Miller, yet continue waiting and hoping for Rodriguez to impress me again. Tarantino's segment was no award winner either. I've always thought they have done other people's stories better then their own, but this was so close to their own that they blew it for me again.<br/><br/>Overall great movie. Goes right next to ""Once Upon a Time in Mexico"" in the ""could have been better, should have been better"" pile, but a great movie none-the-less. Don't let my ranting confuse you, go see it for your self. You'll probably like it. I'm just caught up in the ""could have been better"" zone."

","I thought that I would be downcast upon leaving the theater, but the film empowered me; made me feel strong, manly. The fiancÃ©e appeared more fierce and beautiful than she did when I entered. The movie was packed with strong, sexy,vibrant, female characters. I have never been so attracted to women on screen, nor felt as capable of feats of endurance as I did upon exit of the theaters. Filmmakers who wish to portray their female leads as sexually attractive would do well to take a page from this screenplays and give their divas the fire and passion that such roles deserve. No Bond girl would have lasted a week in Basin City, that's for sure. <br/><br/>In many respects it really is a masterpiece. It will never be a Citizen Kane , but the homage that it renders is almost tearfully beautiful. But the thing that gets me is that folks over 45 didn't like it. The movie was shot to be nostalgic with the blue screen and all. Why didn't the old folks like it? Go figure."
"therRhetor","10","1","4","2 April 2005"," Digital done well
","Sin City is one of the few movies you will ever experience that feels entirely and refreshingly different than everything else out there.<br/><br/>That being said, where your tastes run with it is purely subjective. It's easy to foresee that many watchers will dislike the flick; it's an oddity in a world of cinematic conformity. It's like the new kid in school and no one is quite sure how to feel about him. As for me, I think the new kid is pretty damn cool.<br/><br/>As the movie industry's second major attempt at an all-digital film, the quality far surpasses that of 'Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow.' So Sin City now throws to the forefront the possibility of stretching creative boundaries in cinema. All walls that have blocked in film's possibilities since its creation are now serving as fuel for digital fire. The possibilities seem limitless.<br/><br/>The entire visual experience of Sin City is mind-blowing. It really reads like a comic book. And while I admit that at first I wasn't at home in this new digital world, as the story unfolded (and Jessica Alba was oggled by the camera) I was completely drawn in. I started dwelling in the comic book, becoming part of it, in a way that only those blessed with the most vivid and powerful imaginations previously could.<br/><br/>As for the editing and pacing, at first I questioned their efficacy; but, once again, as I was learning to soak up this new visual treat, my opinion on these fronts was changing in tune. By the end, I had full faith in the directors' handling of the film. Robert Rodriguez, Quentin Tarantino, once again we must thank you for bringing something fresh and new to our world.<br/><br/>Let's just hope that their efforts kindle the creative flame burning inside of us and a new generation of courageous cinematic trailblazers has found itself the perfect tool for bringing to life, and to the audience, their most brilliant imaginations.<br/><br/>Digital done well."

","We saw Sin City on its opening night. Our local paper gave it 4 stars. Good thing it's black & white (with touches of color), because it is a real gore fest! I kid you not...it makes Kill Bill look like a PG movie. Decapitations, severed limbs, mangled penises, buckets of blood, hatchets in the face, viciousness toward women (and a child), lots of nudity (okay, that part wasn't so bad!), cannibalism, pedophilia, a drooling yellow devil...shall I go on? <br/><br/>It's one of the worst--no, wait, it's THE most violent/gory film I've ever seen on the big screen. However, it's all done in a stylized comic-book way--the blood is white instead of black. Otherwise it would be too graphic and sickening. <br/><br/>Sin City had some dark humor. In one scene, a very tough guy character is being put to death in the electric chair. After his body convulses and smokes, he opens his eyes, spits out a mouthful of blood, and says ""Is that all you pussies got?"" <br/><br/>I'm not familiar Frank Miller or the Sin City series at all, though I love Tarantino's films. (Tarantino was given a guest director credit because he lent a hand in a few scenes. And you can tell which ones.) This movie is well-done and interesting for the kind of movie it is, and it is definitely the ultimate in pulp fiction if you're a fan of the genre."

Yes it is violent, Yes it is fun BUT is it a must watch? for movie fans it is... for the people who enjoyed White Chicks and AVP please stay away from this movie.<br/><br/>Set in a nowhere metropolis, the film opens with a gaspingly beautiful image of a woman staring into the night. Dressed in a shimmering gown the color of newly spilled blood, she stands with her back to the camera, oblivious.

"djh_hibma","7","1","4","31 March 2005"," Gorgeously filmed, Brutally violent
","I can't say that this is the best film I have seen in my entire life but it does bring the comic book to the big screen in a spectacular manner. The screen shots alone make this movie worth seeing. This film requires some suspension of disbelief and as soon as you do that it jumps out of the screen and brings it to life. If your into comic books, even a little, you will like this movie. If you think their for geeks who play dungeons and dragons, save your money. Back to the actual look of the movie, the use of color in the film is deliberate and allows for the suspension of disbelief to continue which adds a tremendous element to the film. While the movie is in black and white, it helps to disguise the violence which happens every other second in the film. I am going to assume that the violence will be the biggest criticism of the film, and I can easily see why. I, however, would say that it truly describes the place of BaSIN City which is full of crime and evil people doing evil things and the heroes that try and make the world a better place, whether for others or them self I'll let you decide. This movie is groundbreaking in the way it was filmed and for the most part the story is intriguing and involving. I was a little disappointed with the flow of the three original stories being forced together in the film; I think they should have taken liberties from the comic books and blended the stories a bit more together. I enjoyed the film even though I didn't agree with a lot of it morally. It shows how corrupt things can become and how naive we are to react to it and blame those that may actually be in the right. Like every good comic, its good against evil, its just that everyone has blood on their hands in this movie."

","Rodriguez throws you into the pages of the SIN CITY novels and the movie is much the better for it. Not only does the look mirror the novel, but much of the writing seems to have been retained. While some lines are awkward when spoken, it adds to the abstract, stylized reality that is created on the screen. And once you've adapted to the style of the movie, it's easy to let the stories work their magic. Are these future noir? 21st century horrors? It doesn't matter what it's called. The ride is new and captivating.<br/><br/>Who's had anything good to say about Mickey Rourke's acting in decades? They will now, since he turns in the most stellar job in what is generally an exemplary ensemble. (I say generally, since some of the younger actors seem to miss the feel of the material, like contemporary singers trying to perform 50s torch songs.) Even under a nose and chin of make-up, Rourke gives a disturbing humanity to an unlovable man. Or is he? Bruce Willis seems to turn in his best work in ensembles (PULP FICTION, 12 MONKEYS come to mind immediately) and his work in SIN CITY is no exception. And Clive Owen proves yet again that he can animate whatever material he's given. I don't want to slight the film's women, but it is the men who dominate SIN CITY. And it is the story of the three protagonists and their love for women that is the story of SIN CITY."

","Got lucky and scored a free pass to a sneak preview of this Robert Rodriguez and Frank Miller collaboration. From the start, I knew it was going to be very interesting 'cinematicly'; shot mostly in a 'black and whiteized' color film, with some elements left as true color. The substantial use of voice overs to narrate the characters thoughts. All contributed to the 'feel' of the film. I was pleased with the results. For me it made the film take on a more'graphic novel' look than a typical action movie; which is what (I guess) they were going for. The story is set in Basin City, thus the title baSIN City. A play on words I enjoyed. Taken further you could make it Base Sin, and what is more base of a sin than murder, which is what the movie is about; murder, revenge and justice. The plot is weaved around 3 separate story lines, so be prepared. They don't flit from one to the other, but are shown mostly in total, then weakly tied together. The script is very Film Noir with a good dash of sarcastic edgy humor thrown in. The acting is solid, but no real standouts to me. I feel that was the way RR/FM wanted it. The F/X were fabulous. I loved the splashes of color used in spots standing out amongst the gray gritty city. Overall I found the movie an enjoyable and Original movie experience, one well worth seeing. 8/10"

In the midst of so much unnecessary violence. An unnecessary film, perverted and ridiculous. At least, Jaime King has a beautiful face and beautiful cleavage. Seeing Jaime King is a unique pleasure, but to endure the poor performance of Mickey Rourke, with that unbearable face, that no one can stand, it is a nightmare.

"ElMaruecan82","10","1","5","24 July 2015"," Makes Gotham City look like Munchkin Land ...
","Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino are of the same generation, but not the same range of talent, there's one element where Tarantino surpasses his friend : writing and storytelling, and in Hollywood, that means a lot. So at the time Rodriguez made himself famous with the 'Mexican' trilogy and the 'Spy kids' series, Tarantino was already a unanimously acclaimed director and the standard-bearer of a cinematic revolution that gave witty dialogs and random Pop Culture references their significances to weird intricate plots. And I must add with style and an appealing overdose of fun and violence.<br/><br/>Honestly, I'm not much a fan of the three last movies directed by Tarantino, I believe he got so wrapped up in his success that he never tried to get out of his comfort zone. However, I believe the ""Kill Bill"" series to be his last masterpiece, the pinnacle of the Tarantino touch, a vibrant, flamboyant and emotionally engaging, homage to the Martial Arts movies that influenced him. But the film had style too, and style was an area where Robert Rodriguez wasn't just comfortable but capable to outrank his gifted friend. So, it's just as in 2005, he came out with his own ""Kill Bill"", a no-less dazzling and hypnotic masterpiece named ""Sin City"", based on Frank Miller's graphic comic-book series. And that one of the best-looking movies of the 2000's never got nominated for Best Cinematography is as sinful as any of the sins in ""Sin City"".<br/><br/>Dark and gloomy, the titular setting would make Gotham City look like Munchkin land, it's over-the-top film-noir photography reminded me of these Photoshop effects where I playfully augmented the contrast to give an eerie look to the most banal image. Rodriguez, a man of his generation, understood the endless implications of computerized images : basically, you could make miracles with it. And that's what the movie is, a miracle. The black-and-white look like painted with China ink, and colors are highlighted every once in a while in the most visually affecting ways, blood is like red stains soiling the frame, the blonde hair of that Marv's sweetheart is mesmerizing, and sometimes, colors get you to more sickening reactions such as the guts of that gutless Yellow Bastard. Color is like a protagonist in the film, images serve the story as the story serves them, it's like the perfect symbiosis of the form and the content.<br/><br/>And with an extraordinary wizardry, Rodriguez edits the film to create another spellbinding symbiosis with the storytelling. I said Tarantino was superior in storytelling, but Rodriguez conceals his weakness by adapting the comics on-the-nose, straight-forwardly, an image speaking for thousand words but thousand-word monologues feeling like verbal caresses. Structure-wise, the film employs the same circular narrative that made ""Pulp Fiction""'s reputation. In ""Sin City"", characters meet each other, you leave them someplace and find them again in another, they're always part of the same universe like different pieces of chess game that only at the end, reward your patience and give you the whole scope, through its bunch of crooked politicians, corrupt cops, and 'gold-hearted' prostitutes observing a fragile truce with the Police. With all the gangsters, priests, dancers, lawyers, killers and cannibals, ""Sin City"" is like the matrix of sex and violence in urban Pop Culture, where being good is the exception... no matter to which side of the Law one belongs.<br/><br/>Hell, what do you expect from such a title anyway? You have your share of Gothic sensuality, high-heels and G-strings, women are poetic sexiness in motion and men lustful and justice enforcers (the true justice), there's an odd mix of old-school characterization and modernity, and the whole movie is so dizzyingly good you never have time to analyze, it's a film to enjoy, to be entertained with. And it's a fun movie where you know all the actors had fun playing in it. In a way, ""Sin City"" is like Rodriguez' revenge on Tarantino, it's his own star-studded movie with Michael Madsen from ""Reservoir Dogs"", Bruce Willis from ""Pulp Fiction"" and a female casting instinct that has nothing to envy on Tarantino, from Rosario Dawson as a luscious dominatrix to the unforgettable Carla Gugino who makes quite an entrance in the film. But I must say Mickey Rourke makes the most durable impression, and I have the feeling that his come-back that pinnacled with ""The Wrestler"" started with ""Sin City"".<br/><br/>""Sin City"" is a gem, one of the best films of the last decade, a masterpiece of Pop Culture, and Rodriguez' most mature and complete movie. He who asked his friend Tarantino to tell a joke in ""Desperado"" asked him to direct a part in ""Sin City"", it was the car scene between Clive Owen and Benicio Del Toro. I have less to say about that moment than this touching interaction between the two directors, there is something of Lucas and Coppola in them, Coppola was already an established director in 70's yet he always supported Lucas and encouraged him to push the envelope as best he could. In a way, ""Sin City"" is Rodriguez' ""Star Wars""."

It acts as a great memorial for her career. <br/><br/>Rob Rod is such a visionary. I love his style, and I think it fits so perfectly in the realm of graphic novels. His big explosions and blood obsession makes it a giant film with so much action. Never a dull moment. <br/><br/>Nailed it! Go watch NOW"
"Al_The_Strange","9","1","5","23 August 2014"," Sin City Review
","So there I was in the fall of '05, scoping out the DVD rentals at the old shoppette, looking for the next big thrill. I just happen to look up at the TV hanging on the ceiling to see them playing one of the new releases like they always do; I see Jackie boy and his gang getting cut up by deadly little Miho, spewing white blood everywhere. Don't know how these creeps get away with playing that stuff for all the public to see, kids and all, but it hit me from that moment onward that Sin City must be a hell of a show.<br/><br/>The film is literally black, white, and red all over: a smooth and breezy combo of extreme style and extreme violence. It's got all the works: car chases, shootouts, fist fights, knife fights, dancing ladies, and more. Everybody here has a score to settle, and they leave body trails miles long. There's so much blood, it's ridiculous. The sheer brutality makes it all a real whopper too. As much of a looker as the movie is, and with all its moxie, it's the stuff that comic book dreams are made of.<br/><br/>This picture takes after four of Frank Miller's original stories. The Customer Is Always Right is a short segment (originally test footage) that sets the tone at the beginning, and rounds things off at the end. The Hard Goodbye has always been my favorite: a real hard case about a down-out-of-his-luck fella avenging a dame's death, and the resulting rampage sure is gutsy. The Big Fat Kill is consistently thrilling doozy of a tale too, showing a guy doing everything it takes to stop war breaking out on the streets. That Yellow Bastard is split up at the beginning and end, and it is a fairly touching story about a double-crossed cop trying to protect a broad. All these stories play in the tropes of hard-boiled noir stories we all know and love: it's a world where cops are rotten, everybody with power is corrupt, criminals are noble anti-heroes, and they're all using brute force to worm their way out of exploitation and to find their own brand of justice. It's definitely amoral territory, but that's pretty much the point, and the movie handles the goods in all the right ways to make each story hit on all six.<br/><br/>Photography is solid. Editing has a few choppy parts, but a lot of it is precise and good. It's especially swell considering that most everything was shot on green-screens, and even the actors had to be spliced in together to make their scenes work. There are a lot of crazy lighting, coloring, and transition effects, most of which hold up, but there are times when it seems kinda cheap. The whole movie looks cartoony and processed, but as a moving comic book, it works great. All the players are ace. Writing can be blunt and choppy, but it helps the style. This production has some fine-looking sets, props, costumes. Most special effects hold up, especially considering that most of the movie is computer-animated. The music's not bad either.<br/><br/>Booze, babes, guns, cars, tough guys, blood...you find the right alley in Sin City, you can find anything. Recommended for mature audiences.<br/><br/>If you bag this on home video, you can either see this as one big cut with all the stories cut up precisely, or with each story separate with some good new scenes. Both ways work great in their own ways.<br/><br/>4.5/5 (Entertainment: Perfect | Stories: Very Good | Film: Good)"
"SnoopyStyle","8","1","5","15 August 2014"," Original style
","Based on the Frank Miller graphic novel series and directed mainly by Robert Rodriguez, this has 4 stories of Basin City; The Hard Goodbye, The Big Fat Kill, That Yellow Bastard and The Customer is Always Right. It's a highly stylized black and white visual with splashes of brilliant colors. It is completely unique and original. It fits the stories and the genre so well. 'Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow' tried something similar but that one doesn't have the edge. That one felt lifeless whereas this one is overflowing with power. The actors are all embodying the old hard-boiled noir style of acting. They are successful for the most part. Mickey Rourke is the best of them all. For some reason, he doesn't seem to be acting whereas everybody else are just pretending. He embodies his character so well that it doesn't even feel like he's acting."
"empireofred","1","1","5","14 May 2013"," Definitely the WORST movie I have ever suffered through
","Oh this movie was so bad I don't know where to begin. Black and white? Really? Then there's the sadistic nature of everyone in it. The gore, the blood, that disgusting yellow guy; everything in this film is unpleasant and disturbing. I didn't even like the protagonist to be honest. Aside from what I said, the story didn't make any sense to me, and I still don't know how in the world I sat through all of it. I didn't think I would find a movie that was going to be worse than the ""Scary movie"" series, but this one tops that too in the list of the ""WORST MOVIES OF ALL TIME."" I really don't understand how it got such a high rating."
"kitchenaut-1","1","1","5","23 April 2011"," Studied Camp In Pulp Noir Setting
","That's what it feels like watching this film. It's a tour-de-force in post modern smugness. The actors deliver lines as if in the worst Corman adaptation of a Chandler novel, and the whole enterprise seems like a mash-up of cultural anachronisms, a patchwork of Noir, John Woo and punk. People have told me the comic is like this, but that just means the source material is a lazy exercise in self-indulgent genre 'subversion'. ""Get this, I can write like Raymond Chandler, but add gun-wielding punk prostitutes and mutants, that makes this art!"" No, it makes it affected and tedious postmodern claptrap. The sort of thing a pretentious 17-year old English literature student considers an art film, or Tarantino an auteur."
"MBunge","4","1","5","12 October 2010"," Proves why fidelity to the source material is not always a good quality in movie adaptations
","If what you want is something relentlessly faithful to the source material, Sin City is THE movie for you. If what you want is a good film, Sin City is an amateurish mess.<br/><br/>Based on the comic books by Frank Miller and yes, most of them are comic books not graphic novels, this movie takes three Sin City tales and compresses them into one interwoven film. Mickey Rourke is Marv, a superhumanly tough thug out to avenge the death of a beautiful woman murdered next to him in bed. Bruce Willis is Hartigan, a superhumanly tough senior citizen cop out to protect a beautiful girl from the sick bastard who wants to kill her. Clive Owen is Dwight, a superhumanly tough guy hiding from his past and out to protect beautiful prostitutes from a rogue cop named Jack Rafferty (Benicio Del Toro) and the mob that wants to bring the women back into their control. If you're noticing a bit of similarity between those three stories, you're on the right track.<br/><br/>What's good - <br/><br/>Dwight having an imaginary conversation with a corpse in a car, Mickey Rourke as Marv and a topless Carla Gugino.<br/><br/>What's bad - <br/><br/>The dialog is painfully stilted and stifling. Words that burn the page when linked to a single image weigh the film down like lead when spoken by actors in real-time. It's like a Shakespeare play where the characters give these long speeches and the actors have to figure out what to do while they keep talking. But while the rhythm of the Bard's words gives the actors something to hang their performances on, the repetitive Spillane-speak of Sin City traps the actors amber.<br/><br/>Color is splashed haphazardly throughout the film, to the point that when you finally get to That Yellow Bastard...instead of being a disturbingly creepy image, he's just another theatrical effect. Maybe there was some design to the way color was used, but I can't detect it and it all just becomes distracting with usually no reason why something is in color or why it shifts from black-and-white to rainbow and back.<br/><br/>Cramming several Sin City stories together also highlights the sameness of the adolescent nihilism that runs through them. The one note that Miller played so beautifully in the books is pounded into your brain over and over again.<br/><br/>I call it an amateurish mess, even with the talent and skill of Rodriguez and Tarantino, because just as some comic creators today refuse to utilize the full capabilities of the word and picture, Sin City abandons or rejects some of the basic things a motion picture can do. Comic and Film are two different mediums and you cannot tell the same story in each in the exact same way.<br/><br/>It is very visually stylized, and if that's your thing it might make up for the storytelling weaknesses of the film. If not, you'll come away wondering what all the fuss is about.<br/><br/>I may be a little too hard on Sin City, the movie. It may be fine as an abnormally violent, visually indulgent crime picture. But because it is almost a literal translation, it ends up being nothing like the cinematic equivalent of Miller's brilliant work."
"mthomas-39","3","1","5","2 March 2007"," What was the fuss all about
","The film was OK, it was watch able, but I wouldn't watch it again. (I would recommend you hire it and not buy the DVD) At the start I though this was going to be a good film, good pace, good story line, but all that disappeared after the first 30 minutes.<br/><br/>*** Spoiler below ***** <br/><br/>I was just glad when Bruce Willis finally shot himself so the film could end. (just to confirm the ended you spotted at least an hour ago) Again another film that could have taken us all on an unpredictable journey ended up following the normal predictability that just makes you want the film to end.<br/><br/>Just another comic book that fails to deliver a plot worth talking about, why do these films always seem to be so bad, we now had; Spawn, Xmen, fab4 and Dare Devil. This is by no means an endless list; they are just the one that spring to mind.<br/><br/>Only the Spiderman series and the first half the new Superman films have we had a decent comic book film, since the original 3 superman films. (I know there were 4, but the last one was bad too)"
"DavidSim240183","10","1","5","21 October 2006"," The thinking man's Pulp Fiction
","Sin City is one of the greatest films of the past decade. A pure adrenaline rush of action shot with a truly epic scope, it grabs you by the throat and never lets go. A bloody mosaic of revenge tales sharply focused by unforgettable characters, Sin City is quite simply a masterpiece.<br/><br/>Comics are being adapted for film all the time now. Some are excellent like Superman and Batman Begins. They embody the feel of a comic in ways never thought possible. Some are completely awful like Batman & Robin, mere mockeries of their source material. Sin City sets a whole new standard.<br/><br/>Based on the graphic novels by Frank Miller, Sin City is film-noir pulp, shot in black and white with flickers of colour creeping into the picture, almost like Pleasantville. Both films are similar because we have these one-dimensional characters struggling to break through to all three dimensions.<br/><br/>Another film I'm reminded of is Pulp Fiction. Both have a similar structure and individual stories that flow into another. But Sin City is far superior. There is a human face ever-present in each one of these tales. We get beneath their skin and learn in the corrupt world of Sin City, even crazed vigilantes have human souls.<br/><br/>Every frame of Sin City tells a story. There is so much here it could be a TV series. Although we only see three stories, by the end, we've learnt so much we feel like we've penetrated the darkest recesses of this city.<br/><br/>The film begins innocently enough with a three minute prologue that in a way is the most intriguing story for me. A beautiful woman in a red dress (and red lips), surrounded by black and white. Standing on a veranda to get some air from a party, she's joined by a smooth talker, who instinctively knows she's running from something. That in itself would make a great setup for a story. Unfortunately we never find out what she's running from, and neither does her companion, when he kills her.<br/><br/>That death scene is ironically one of Sin City's quieter moments. But it's interesting because even at this early stage, we know that every person in this city has something to hide. On to the next story, where Hartigan (Bruce Willis), one of the few decent cops left in this city is about to retire because of a heart problem.<br/><br/>Hartigan is searching for Nancy, a child kidnapped by Junior Roarke, the son of a powerful senator. He's already killed four children, but the law can't touch him because of his connections. Before Roarke has his wicked way with her, Hartigan catches up, and kills him. And then gets killed himself. For being the only decent cop, willing to do the right thing. That story would seem to be at an end. Only to be picked up later. Remember, in Sin City nothing is what it seems.<br/><br/>The next story is my favourite. Marv (brilliantly played by Mickey Rourke) is a sociopath with hidden layers. He spends the night with a hooker, Goldie. The film makes a point of this by illuminating her golden locks in stark contrast to the black and white of everything else. The next morning, Goldie is dead, and the police blame Marv for her murder.<br/><br/>Marv goes on the run, and journeys into the seedy corners and seamy underside of Sin City to find Goldie's killer, and avenge her. Marv has more than a passing resemblance to Hellboy, and it's great fun watching this tortured monster trying to reclaim his soul, even if it means committing murder to do it.<br/><br/>Throwing out wisecracks every five seconds, Mickey Rourke gives one of his best performances in years. His internal monologue allows us to get right inside Marv's psyche, easily enabling us to side with him on his vendetta. Special mention should also go to Elijah Wood in this segment as Goldie's killer, Kevin. Radiating a steely eyed coldness behind a pair of glasses and a thin smile, he makes a huge impression whenever he's around and does it without ever uttering a single word.<br/><br/>Marv's is quite a tragic tale. Taken by a hooker he hardly knew, he fell in love with somebody who probably only viewed it as a one night stand. And yet he was willing to give everything for her. Just because she showed an interest in him. Marv is such a complex character, he should get his own series.<br/><br/>The next story is the longest, and exposes the corruption that exists in this city. A battle between Irish radicals and weapon wielding whores on the streets. This initially didn't engage me as much as the others, but after a while it did. There are some marvellous action scenes, and a fine turn from the ever impressive Michael Clarke Duncan as the radicals ringleader. It's quite a virtuoso battle, like something out of a Viking novel.<br/><br/>Bruce Willis' tale picks up again, where he actually survived, but thanks to that same corrupt senator, gets wrongfully imprisoned for Nancy's abduction. Nancy and Hartigan strike up a friendship through letters, keeping him alive throughout his imprisonment. When he's released, he checks up on her, the only person left in his life who means anything to him.<br/><br/>Nancy is now a stripper (fetchingly played by Jessica Alba), sending the message that in Sin City, either you grow up fast, or you may not grow up at all. Hartigan has to save her again from the same abductor, who's now a grotesque creature called Yellow Bastard. A fierce battle ensues, with Hartigan making a noble sacrifice for Nancy.<br/><br/>I understand there are sequels in the pipeline. I can't wait. I want to learn more about the fascinating denizens of this city. This film is a breathtaking, stunning tapestry of events, beautifully realised, impeccably crafted, bringing to life the marvellous world of Sin City."

","Based on the graphic novel series by Frank Miller, he co-directs with Robert Rodriguez (Desperado, From Dusk Till Dawn), as well as guest direction from Quentin Tarantino (Pulp Fiction, Kill Bill) for one sequence, to bring his comic book creation to life. Basically the film sees three interlinked stories set in the dark and miserable ultra- violent metropolis town of Basin City, nicknamed ""Sin City"", specifically characters embroiled in all forms of crime, from corrupt cops, dangerous criminals and femme fatales. Aging police officer John Hartigan (Bruce Willis) stops serial child killer Roark Junior (Nick Stahl) from raping and killing his fourth known victim, eleven year old Nancy Callahan (Saw's Makenzie Vega), the police have been bribed by Junior's father Senator Roark (Tombstone's Powers Boothe) to cover up his crimes. Hartigan's corrupt partner Bob (Michael Madsen) told him to walk away, but he refused, Hartigan catches up to Roark Junior in a warehouse, despite his bad heart, he does get shot in the shoulder but Hartigan shoots off Junior's ear, hand and genitals, after that Bob has recovered and shoots Hartigan in the back, but sirens are heard approaching and Nancy is safe and sound, for now. Marv (Mickey Rourke) has a one-night stand with Goldie (Jaime King), but waking up finds her dead, he flees to avoid framing and explains to his lesbian parole officer Lucille (Spy Kids' Carla Gugino) he will avenge her death, through informants he finds out the Roark family murdered her, he goes to the family farm, only to be subdued by silent stalker and Goldie's killer Kevin (Elijah Wood), he wakes up in a basement with Lucille. She explains the killer is a cannibal and that Goldie was a prostitute, corrupt cops kill Lucille, while Marv kills the cops, apart from the leader who reveals Cardinal Patrick Henry Roark (Rutger Hauer) arranged Goldie's murder in Sin City's red-light district Marv convinces Goldie's identical twin sister Wendy (Jaime King) he is not the killer, she and him return to the farm where Marv kills Kevin, after hearing the cardinal's confession that he and Kevin ate prostitutes to ""consume their souls"" he kills the cardinal, but in the end Marv is captured by the cops and executed in the electric chair. Shellie (Brittany Murphy) is harassed by her abusive ex-boyfriend Jackie Boy (Benicio Del Toro) and his cronies, her current boyfriend Dwight McCarthy (Clive Owen) violently warns him to leave her alone, and he follows the thugs to Old Town to find them harassing young prostitute Becky (Alexis Bledel), prostitute leader Gail (Rosario Dawson) also witnesses the scene, so martial arts expert Miho (Devon Aoki) kills Jackie Boy and the gang. But then they find out he is ""hero cop"" Detective Lieutenant Jack Rafferty, if the cops find out he has been killed the truce between them and the prostitutes will end and the mob could wage war, Dwight goes to the tar pits to dispose of the bodies, a hired mercenary almost gets hold of Jackie Boy's severed head until it is retrieved, but Gail is kidnapped by mob enforcer Manute (Michael Clarke Duncan) who forces her to betray the prostitutes, but Dwight trades them the head for Gail's life, only to have the head stuffed with explosives, and the mercenaries are gunned down by the prostitutes. Hartigan has recovered in hospital, but Junior is in a coma, Nancy promises to write to write anonymous letters to him while he is framed and put in prison, this continues for eight years, but the letters stop and he receives a severed finger, so he confesses to the given crimes and gets parole, he searched for and finds adult Nancy Callahan (Jessica Alba) working at Kadie's Bar as an exotic dancer. Hartigan realises however he was set up, the Yellow Bastard, who is actually Junior (Nick Stahl), deformed due to years of regenerative surgery, attacks and takes Nancy to the family farm, but Hartigan catches up, fakes a heart attack, and gets the chance to kill Junior, with Nancy safe he knows that Senator Roark will continue hunting them, so to ensure her safety Hartigan kills himself, justifying it as a ""fair trade"". Also starring Josh Hartnett as The Man, Marley Shelton as The Customer, Arie Verveen as Murphy, Frank Miller as Priest, Insomnia's Nicky Katt as Stuka, Tommy Flanagan as Brian and Rick Gomez as Klump. Willis is indeed poignant as the disgraced cop who will do anything to protect the girl, Owen is good as the tough private eye, Del Toro is suitably dark humoured, Alba is sexy as the victim dancer, but it is indeed Rourke who steals the show as the soft-hearted ex-con out to kill his sweetheart's killers. The film does have cheesy dialogue and one or two small repetitive moments, but with great chase and gun filled sequences, accompanied with high bloody violence, it doesn't matter, but what really makes this film really stand out is the sensational colour, like an authentic comic book, filmed in black and white it's the splashes of bright colours, especially in the violent and sexy scenes, overall it is a great neo-noir action thriller. Bruce Willis was number 35 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars. Very good!"

It was stylish, intense, funny, action packed, but most importantly, a spectacular film.<br/><br/>Right from the start you know you're not in for a normal one hour and thirty minute run-of- the-mill movie. It grabs you by the collar of your trench coat and pulls you into its tales of sexy dames, killers with hearts of gold and ultra-violence.<br/><br/>The violence, and boy, is there a lot, isn't to much to handle, thanks to the MPAA forcing Robert Rodriguez to cut out some blood, is perfectly executed. It matches panel for panel the genius comic that Miller created and wrote. It never gets to be to much to handle, and most importantly you care deeply for the characters by the time the movies done with.<br/><br/>The acting was stellar, with Mickey Rourke and Clive Owen giving the performances of their careers.

But I cannot say if its better, because it's a total different movie.<br/><br/>Bruce Willis finally plays a great role again and also Clive Owen has definitely made his breakthrough now. It's even cool to see 'hobbit' Elijah Wood as a stone cold killer and Benicio Del Toro in a very cool role.

"Prisaries","10","1","5","7 June 2005"," An award winning masterpiece
","Sin City is a graphic and fascinating tale of human minds when confronted with kindness and love; the old ways of unquestionable dedication to individuals that have been saved by unconditional love. Each character, despite their anger and violence, had a sense of morality that doesn't openly exist in the modern world. This film showed humanity in people with the world in its worst possible state, whilst also showing pure evil in others. The plot, although interconnected, managed to portray each story individually well. Consequently, the experience of the story and characters is rewarding in itself. Then came the direction. Robert Rodriguez is an excellent director but in addition to the story, he managed to shoot a masterpiece totally in green screen. Quentin Tarantino added an aspect that completed the masterpiece and Frank Miller provided characters that will never really be forgotten. In conclusion, Sin City can intrinsically be described as drinking absolute vodka in a Jaguar X8 with your soul mate, on the way to a six month vacation in the Caribbean."
"ECILAM","10","1","5","10 April 2005"," Long Overdue... and Well Worth the Wait
","Over time I've come to abandon hope of a movie being made based on material originally from a comic book or graphic novel that was not only faithful to the source material, but actually conveyed the same atmosphere and feeling as the original. Sin City has changed that.<br/><br/>This is what happens when Hollywood bypasses its default settings and allows true creative minds to do their thing. It's by far the best new movie I've seen in the last couple of years. The casting was spot-on. Every frame of action is a work of art in itself, following Frank Miller's tales of two-time losers and sultry dames -- virtually panel for panel from the original artwork -- giving the viewer a visual treat not to be found elsewhere.<br/><br/>I first read the Sin City stories when they were published in the 1990s. Dwight, Gail, good IL' Marv and Miho -- deadly little Miho -- became like old and memorable pals. I found myself repeating bits and pieces of dialogue from those pages years down the line, often forgetting where I'd first picked them up. In short, the series was and is by far one of my all-time favorites in the underrated art form. And I couldn't be happier that now, finally, a film has come along that does it justice.<br/><br/>Ten out of ten. I give Sin City my highest possible recommendation. See it in the theater."
"blazenwo","10","1","5","9 April 2005"," Great Comic Movie!
","Sin City was a great comic, and thus, a great movie. It isn't a realistic drama nor is it another Kill Bill type action fest. Instead, its an odd mixture of 50's noir; hard boiled cops (Hartigan) and tough guys (Marv) along with a host of other typical noir characters fight for their women in a city full of corruption and sin. Its a merger of old school noir and modern day action, and what a mixture it is. The cinematography is superb, with some really striking imagery (white silhouettes instead of regular black ones is one of the easiest examples of this stylistic approach).<br/><br/>All in all, its an excellent tribute to the comic, which itself is a great tribute to the noir genre of film."

If you were a fan of Pulp Fiction, or the Desperado series, this film is the only equal out there that you can find. It is just as brilliant, there is a wry wit to the dialogue, and the stars aren't ridiculous- they are their characters- not actors playing themselves, playing their role. There aren't any witty lines for Willis, they are all served cold, and powerfully. If ever a action packed r-rated film with animation were to win an Oscar it'd be this one."

I have to say this movie is a rebirth of that genre. But done in fantastical world called Basin City, what made me fall in love with. This film is how they take the comic book genre or should I say graphic novel, making a whole new genre that is neo-noir now. I've heard and read how most people have focused on. The gore and violence in this film but what they do not understand is. That the violence the gore is the brush they chose to use to paint this beautiful work of art.<br/><br/>Everything about this from the direction down to the design and look are brilliant. I enjoyed how the actors became there characters and can you talk about a better cast. I loved how they used this voice over like They did in old noir to give a look into. The depths of the person soul, I especially loved the Dwight character he seemed the most tormented.

","Let me cut straight to the point. Sin City was by far one of the best movies that I have ever had the privilege of watching.<br/><br/>From minute one of this masterpiece, you can give up reality and surrender everything to this movie. The action is non-stop, as is the violence and the gore, and just when you think things are going to calm down... BAM!!! Miller and Rodriguez kick you square in the nuts with an economy sized boot of action to make sure you're not going to forget this movie experience. I won't even mention what the plot's awesomeness could do to you because that's far to graphic for this review.<br/><br/>Now, on to the characters. I will say that casting half of Hollywood has been the downfall for many movies, but Sin City takes that concept and double-barrel-shotgun-blasts it right out the window. The performances were solid. Mickey Rourke as Marv = HARDCORE!!! Jessica Alba alone could have made this movie sexy, but let me say that the other women in this movie did a good job contributing to Sin City's, dare I say... Sinfulness. Willis and Owen were also outstanding. These two guys bring the pain to the umpteenth level. Finally, Elijah Wood... Wow... so Elijah's character, Kevin, was like taking Charlie Brown, Wolverine, and Hannibal Lector and rolling them into a nice neat little psychopath. True bad-asses. Every single one of them.<br/><br/>""I'm still trying to put my face back together because Sin City rocked my face off so much."" <br/><br/>Sin City is, for lack of a better word, Perfect..."
"TonysLittleFriend","8","1","5","4 April 2005"," It'd be a Sin to miss out on this film, which is without a doubt the most faithful comic adaptation of all time.
","Based on three of Frank Miller's Sin City graphic novels, Robert Rodriguez has co-directed the film with Miller himself to create the most loyal comic adaptation ever seen on screen. The film opens with the first portion of the story, That Yellow Bastard, which stars Bruce Willis, Jessica Alba and Nick Stahl. Willis is a detective named Hardigan tracking down a pervert who has kidnapped a little girl named Nancy (Alba plays the older Nancy).<br/><br/>One of the things I was really looking forward to was Powers Boothe and Michael Madsen. Two of my favorite actors, and I haven't seen them in role that fit them for a while. And I was not disappointed. Boothe owned the role of the slimy Governor Rourk. He fits the role. He gives a real darkness to the character. As for Madsen, he IS his role as Willis's ""partner"" Bob. He also gives a mysterious part to the role I can't quite put my finger on. But it's there.<br/><br/>He rescues her from the deranged son of Sin City's senator, Roark, Jr. (Nick Stahl). The story continues at the end with Nancy all grown up and sexy and the senator's son a little more yellow. The second story is The Hard Goodbye and follows the adventures of Marv, appropriately played by Mickey Rourke. Marv is a tough street fighter who's just had the night of his life with a beautiful woman named Goldie (Jaime King). He wakes up the next day to find her lying dead next to him. Marv unleashes a brutal quest for revenge, killing or reassembling anyone who gets in his way. Co-starring is Elijah Wood, Rutger Hauer and Powers Boothe.<br/><br/>Finally, The Big Fat Kill stars Clive Owen as Dwight, a P.I. trying to keep things clean in a dirty city. The cops are corrupt and have a deal with the hookers who live in Old Town  basically don't cause trouble and we'll turn a blind eye to what you do. When a cop winds up dead at the hands of the ladies of the night, the ""something"" is about to hit the fan. Co-starring are Rosario Dawson, Benicio Del Toro, Brittany Murphy and Michael Clarke Duncan. That's about as much info as I can give about these stories without spoiling the fun.<br/><br/>I absolutely love how the film opens. That one scene and all it's brilliant dialog more or less spells out what is yet to come. The film is 18A for a reason. It is incredibly brutal. For example, I'd never once thought I'd describe killings in a movie being more than one castration. You can expect blood to fly, heads to roll, limbs to be severed and pretty much everything else you can expect.<br/><br/>Mickey Rourke gives a brilliant performance as Marv. His whole scene I felt uncomfortable. It was an incredibly brutal scene, that involves an equally creepy Elijah Wood. I'll get to that later. Throughout the scene you can really understand why Marv is seeking revenge for his one night stand. He really was in love. He never had that before. Rourke really hit the nail on the head with this one. Elijah Wood gives his best performance ever, which is a non-speaking role, as the cannibalistic Kevin. A deeply disturbed man.<br/><br/>Bruce Willis gives yet another great performance. But who steals the show in the Willis saga is Jessica Alba just because, well you know. She's too sexy. But anywho. The reason why the movie is the greatest comic book movie ever made is because it looks and acts exactly like the comic book. The characters look and act exactly the way they were in the books. I imagine if you look at the comics and watched the movie, I wouldn't know the difference. It's just as brutal as the books, and it's brilliant use of colors and lack there of is even better.<br/><br/>I don't care what anyone says, this IS the best comic book movie ever. I respect their opinions of course, but it'll be difficult to find one that has the look and feel of the actually comic. That's what a comic book movie is supposed to be. And Sin City is all that, and so much more. Any fan of the comic, as I am, will NOT be disappointed. And it'll make fans out of it. As with many of my friends. This movie is a movie I will not soon forget.<br/><br/>*****/*****"

","After watching ""the making of..."" and late night interviews with some of the actors on TV, I thought I knew what I was expecting when watching this flick. A ""cool"" black and white film shot on green screen, stunning effects, angles galore, and an dark story line. Oh yea...and Jessica Alba looking mighty foxy.<br/><br/>The intro was interesting but the rest of the movie left me bored and shaking my head. At one point, there came a scene which resulted in several people in the audience laughing and saying ""You gotta be kiddin"" and ""That's crazy""...etc. If I wasn't one of those people who stick to the ""Silence is Golden"" rule, I would have shouted the same utterings.<br/><br/>This movie, although very creative and full of eye-candy, is just too dark, sinister and gory for the average crowd. The violence (oh, the violence) is rampant. I don't think the people in our theater were expecting this much blood and guts. And what's with the talking Pez Head??? (inside joke) My wife was freaking out. She turned to me and said ""Wake me up when Bruce Willis comes back on"". She got a good hour of sleep until he returned.<br/><br/>On a positive note, I truly liked Micky Rourke's return to cinema as Marv. I was thrilled to see a good guy turn into ""bad"" good guy. He was ruthless...and to the point. He didn't let crap get in his way and his lines were priceless. They could have written a 2 hour movie called ""Marv"" and I would have loved it. Wish we could all have heroes like him.<br/><br/>The effects are pretty cool and it feels like the comic novel comes to life. However, the scenes and dialog are pretty sappy and you too might find yourself talking back to the screen with ""WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT???!!!"". Viewer beware."
"mattman13","10","1","5","3 April 2005"," One Helluva Guy Movie
","I went to this movie without any expectations except for stylized action. I walked out with my jaw dropped, and my heart still beating from the adrenaline. Sin City is one rough, dirtied up place. It's got hookers, dirty cops, crooks around every corner, bad politicians, even cannibals. Everybody shoots first and asks questions later. What else could a guy ask for? I would like to say that Clive Owen and Mickey Rourke did an especially awesome job. While this movie is as close to perfect as it gets, nothing is perfect. It's kinda hard to believe that Bruce Willis is close to his seventies. Also, I would've liked more background on Josh Hartnett's character. And my last complaint is that everyone has the same tough guy voice. Except maybe Clive Owen. It just gets confusing, because everybody's voice is the same, and they often have you reading the characters minds. Oh, and one more teeny little thing, they could have told us with a little less confusion when we change stories and time lines. But that's as far as the complaints go. This movie has three different stories, which tie up loosely at the end. Each story is intriguing, but what'll really blow you away is the visuals. I think that Robert Rodriguez made a smart move leaving the Directors Guild for this movie. The little splashes of color are the perfect touch. But man, this movie's got blood, gore, action, bullets, punch outs, boobs (lots of boobs, don't take your girlfriend to this one) and kick ass driving scenes. What more could a guy ask for?"
"MovieRat-2","10","1","5","4 April 2005"," Masterpiece
","Films based on comic books (aka graphic novels) are often a hit or miss situation. There have been some great hits: Spider-Man, Batman, X-Men...and some notorious misses: The Punisher, Daredevil. Sin City, based off of Frank Miller's series of graphic novels, is not just a hit, it is without a doubt the best film adaptation of a comic ever. The story (or actually 4 different stories that are loosely connected by their shared setting) is captivating from the very start, filled with indomitable heroes, sympathetic anti-heroes, despicable villains, and one down right freaky Elijah Wood. The casting for this film employs a long list a stars and ""little"" stars which, to my pleasant surprise, emboldens an already spectacular film. Visually, the film is so sleek, so unconventional, so comic bookish it is down right beautiful. You feel like you are actually inside the graphic novel and almost forget that this is a live-action film. More films should be done in black and white (with a little bit of spot-coloring for intensity).<br/><br/>Bewarned, Sin City is not for the faint of heart. The film is filled with lots and lots of violence: a broken bone here, a decapitated head here, a dismembered victim here, an impaled head here, a guy punching another's face to a bloody pulp here...you get the idea. But, despite this, the violence is not ""gratuitous"" but completely necessary for the film. There are also nudity in this film along with one sex scene. The language for the most part is imperceivable, you are so engulfed by the story and the violence that the language just doesn't register. The film also deals with issues that are completely not appropriate for young kids: cannibalism, vengeance by any means necessary (see the explanation on violence), molesting serial killers, and torture to name a few.<br/><br/>The film is rated R for the above reasons mention and that warning should be heeded.<br/><br/>A masterpiece through and through, an instant classic."
"Rogue-32","6","1","5","2 April 2005"," Toto, I don't think we're in Kansas anymore
","Or perhaps that should read, ""Frodo, I don't think we're in the Shire anymore,"" considering how one of our all-time favorite hobbits mutates into an insatiable, head-collecting cannibalistic psycho in Frank Miller's Sin City, without even blinking an eye (literally).<br/><br/>He's only one of the many deranged lunatics we get to spend quality time with in the dark, courtesy of Robert Rodriguez's undeniably faithful film version of Miller's intense and brutal graphic novels. With a screenplay by Miller himself and co-directed by him (with a guest-director credit to Tarantino - what would Sin City be without his contribution, I ask you!?), we get to take a trip the likes of which we've never taken in a movie theatre before, and hopefully we'll never have to take again, but that's just my opinion.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, the film is a stupendous achievement, visually - if you've ever read any of the Sin City graphic novels, you'll recognize the place immediately from the very first shot: beautiful, bleak, barren, brutal - all the good 'b' words. And the stories weave together brilliantly, there's no question: the film works on a plot level too. The performances couldn't be any better either, particularly Mickey Rourke's portrayal of Marv: covered in band-aids, brandishing bucketloads of bile, with a prosthetic profile which looks like a combination of Kirk Douglas and Roy Scheider, this is most definitely the role he was born to play.<br/><br/>And you want babes? There's plenty of babes, most of 'em decked out in bondage gear to beat the band, and they're just as hell-bent on kickin' major butt as their male counterparts, make no mistake. Sounds really swingin' so far, huh? But remember, this is a Rodriguez/Tarentino joint, so of course it's gotta be more than just tastefully violent, it's gotta be yer basic beyond-the-levels-of-human-endurance affair, with broken bodies, half-eaten bodies, Pez-dispensered heads and severed heads galore, and this is just in the first hour. The person I saw it with had her eyes closed nearly the entire time, but that still couldn't shield her from the carnage, because, this, being a Rodriguez/Tarantino joint, remember, has to also include the characters' graphic verbal rehash of the violence: what had just happened to the victim, what it felt like when it happened, and what was going to happen next. So if you're especially squeamish, bring ear plugs to the theatre as well as your eye mask.<br/><br/>When I was watching the film, I couldn't help thinking how much fun making this movie had to have been, especially for Frank Miller, to finally get to see his vision brought so lovingly to life, and this got me through some of the most bombastically brutal sequences. Don't get me wrong again, Sin City is not an incoherent exercise in excessively over-the-top self indulgence (a la From Dusk Til Dawn). It's worth seeing, especially if you could sneak an extremely large flask into the theatre with you (which I kept wishing we had done)."

Sin City revives a genre that is dying on the vine.<br/><br/>I also think that the dialog is some of the best of its kind. It's descriptive yet staccato enough to stay cool, which is the ultimate demand of a film noir film.<br/><br/>The violence is not for everyone. It in fact is over the top, primarily in the Tarantino directed sequences (you'll know when).<br/><br/>Religious people do not commit acts of such brutality that are perpetrated in this film. If the character who killed so many people were gay or of some other social minority, many people would take to the streets in protest.<br/><br/>I will overlook the fact that a groups was painted with such a broad brush in favor of me being a comic book fan who has waited a long time to see this movie.

","I saw Sin City on opening night at my local theater. I was expecting something good and entertaining, but I my expectations were blown out of the water by this beautifully constructed, magnificently written, and awesomely acted piece of art.<br/><br/>First, I must talk about Robert Rodriguez. The man is not afraid to push boundaries and break rules, which has payed off well every time. This is, in my opinion, his best film, and I've seen them all. The directing here is next to flawless. Every frame of this film looks great. He can get his actors to do things you wouldn't expect from them. This is most obvious in Elijah Wood's role as Kevin. He is flat-out creepy as the cannibalistic Christian. Rodriguez's best film to date, and I'm praying for a sequel.<br/><br/>Next, the writing. Brilliant. Thats all I can say. Miller knows what he's doing when it comes to this. The characters are all well developed, the plots are new and unpredictable, and the violence isn't there for the sake of violence, it actually has something to do with the storyline. 2 thumbs up to Miller for this great story.<br/><br/>Finally, the acting. Every actor looks like his or her counterpart in the graphic novels. They are all brilliant, Miller and Rodriguez really lucked getting all these great actors. I must say I was blown away by DelToro, as always. He is so hate-able yet lovable as the corrupt cop Jackie-Boy. His speech in the car with Dwight is hilariously well done with the shifting voices. Rourke is does a bang-up, and I mean bang-up, job as Marv, the hardcore fighter out for revenge of his one true love. Jessica Alba doesn't disappoint either, which I was expecting. But I must say, my favorite here was Alexis Bledel. She is so convincing as a teenage whore who loves her mother. She is the most believable of all the actors here, and I can see her career flourishing in the near future. Hats-off to all on board here, you did a great job.<br/><br/>This is truly a comic book come to life. The dialog is laughable sometimes, but you must give them credit for staying so true to the films origins. The only word i can use to describe this movie is...fun. It is really just a joy to watch these actors and directors having such a great time making such a great movie. As an aspiring film-maker, movies like this are the reason I want to make films. It pushes the boundaries of what has been done before, and sets the bar mighty high for the next comic book-turned-film.<br/><br/>9 out of 10 stars here."
"sandalman_12","8","1","5","2 April 2005"," Amazingly dark and creative
","Sin City is the ultimate film noir. Perpetual night and dark alleyways and bars serve as the setting for 3 stories that cross each other only slightly, each portraying flawed heroes brutally fighting the darkest characters of Sin City.<br/><br/>Dialogue is quick-witted, flippant, coarse. Voice-over narration creates a mood not unlike the hardboiled detective story. Combine that with creative artistic touches of color and a very comic-booky look, and you have Sin City.<br/><br/>Or not quite. There is also the harsh violence and frequent nudity . . . Though the trailers may mislead one into thinking this is a straightforward action film, it is a far deeper and darker and more disturbing film. And that is to its credit. At the same time, the violence is cleverly masked in many parts to make it bearable, even humorous.<br/><br/>Kudos to Rodriguez for making this film. It is definitely a unique movie experience"

","Sin City was very well done. The whole 3 directors doesn't pull away from the story at all. The way everything is done with color it awesome. Only one draw back was that it was a little slow, but that could have been watching it at 1 in the morning. The story pattern isn't the traditional style (beginning, middle, end) it is more of mixed but makes sense. I was disappointed with the ending, but it is based off a comic and those don't tend to offer answers. All of the actors did a great job, but it's a comic so don't think that they stick around for a long time. You have to know how to stick with several stories at once, if not you will be lost. Oh, and it is a hard R, nudity and very graphic killings and such, it was great."

","""By Jove! I've never seen anything so unreal in my life. And earth struck me as something great and invincible, like evil or truth, waiting patiently for the passing away of this fantastic invasion."" Joseph Conrad's Marlow in Heart of Darkness<br/><br/>For the comic book geeks who can't warm up to Spiderman 2 and Hellboy film adaptations because they're dated and lack high art, Frank Miller's Sin City has some of the highest artwork ever with characters straight out of Miller's dark, post-modern noirish magazines. The film is broken up into the morbid adventures of three very tough guys in the fictional Basin City and a bevy of scantily clad femme fatales as deadly as the guys. Against a backdrop of a perfectly CGI'd city, this film has everything a buff could want except sophisticated plot, never a demand when artwork dominates. Sin City abounds, however, in themes of honor, lust and redemption, the stuff of hard-boiled film noir. <br/><br/>Of the three heroes in three stories, Mickey Rourke as Marv is the most memorable, made up like Hellboy, just as impervious to pain as that bad boy, and tender to his women, albeit they are super efficient at prostitution or assassination, depending on the need. The impressive Bruce Willis is Frank Hartigan, ex-cop on his last day before retirement, looking after the welfare of an 11-year old girl, who just happens to be an attractive grown up 19 when he is released from jail. Don't ask; it's complicated but comprehensible when you view the film. For the women, Rosario Dawson as Gail the hooker Valkyrie is unbeatably tough and gorgeous, and just as dangerous as the men for those traits.<br/><br/>The black and white of film noir, which accentuates the broad conflict between good and evil, is splashed with bits of color, especially red blood, and yellow, for that matter. The heroes are about as flawed as a Bogart detective on a bad day, and the women as voluptuous as an R rating will allow before it turns to NC-17. Although the three minimalist plots seem to revolve around some type of revenge, the important element is the evocation of an underworld unremittingly evil, just short of a true hell on earth. Because this is Frank Miller's comic book world, men are riddled with bullet holes but often recover to find revenge another day.<br/><br/>Rourke's confrontation with a powerful bishop and his murderous son is a tribute to Miller's vision of a flawed universe, where evil is unchecked and churches are often at the center of corruption. Sounds like today to me."

Clive Owen has to spout some unintentionally hilarious dialog while failing to live down his innate Britishness, while makes him ridiculous. He doesn't carry off the dialog. He lets the side down. The women are super-funny, framed as they are by some dodgy writing. Alexis Bledel from Gilmore Girls is even worse, badly miscast. The first episode is Bruce Willis in an extremely weak waste of time of a section. Bruce doesn't really fit here either, seeming so old and powerless - the actor playing the part, not only the part itself. The next section has Mickey Rourke in a part that is very little more than superhero special effects. Far, far better than this is the film Watchmen, also using graphic novel as its source."

","For anyone who has actually read sin city graphic novels it would appeal to them,however anyone who actually likes good movies I will urge you to move on. When a movie is so bad that I simply leave the theater I can easily say it wasn't good. The movie is divided up into sub stories each on liking into the other. This formula is fine and adds a unique quality to films. Except when the movie is a rotting pile of trash as in Sin City's case. The dialog in the movie seems to be more cheesy then anything with characters constantly talking to themselves. It almost makes it seem like your watching a parody of other old style movies. Violence and Sex are the two main ingredients to this movie, and sadly nothing else. no character is really memorable or likable. Honestly I was hoping and A-bomb would go off and just kill everyone. However the cheese factor plays well in it since nothing can be taken seriously its a good movie to watch with friends and joke about. I do also have to give points for the creative use of comic book black and white, plus some red occasionally."
"poe426","2","1","6","24 May 2010"," Lost in translation...
","SIN CITY (unfortunately) points up one of the major flaws with most comic books: while the writing may seem new and dynamic to regular readers of comic books (who- trust me- put up with unbelievably bad writing), it simply doesn't hold up when fleshed out. (HELLBOY is another case in point: purty pitchers, but an unvarying storyline that always ends with Mr. Boy pounding his supernatcherl adversaries into dust. Creator Mike Mignola has recently taken to lifting ideas from the late Manly Wade Wellman's Silver John the Baladeer stories and, most recent of all, ""borrowing"" a storyline from the teleseries ANGEL. None of it makes HELLBOY any more readable, or the movies worth watching.) Frank Miller, mistaken for God by many of the aforementioned famished fanboys because he took that bastion of Law and Order, Batman, and tried to make him out to be some kind of Outsider (when, in fact, Batman is ""by the book"" to the core), did a decent enough job with SIN CITY (the comic versions), but the whole thing falls flat on the Big Screen. The reason is all too obvious: the writing. Visually on a par with most video games, it just doesn't hold up where it needs it most."
"cinna665","9","1","6","8 June 2005"," Beautiful movie with a bit disturbing graphic violence
","I have not read the comics Sin City (I did pay a visit to library immediately after the movie), but I must admit, this was one of the greatest comic book adaptations I have ever seen. When I think of X-Men, which was great, or Spiderman, even though they are very unrealistic, they look so much more real life than does Sin City. Sin City really looked like a comic book made into a real movie with real actors. It had such a tremendous feeling of the comic, with people jumping off houses and landing on their feet, cars running over people who still survive. All this amazing comic stuff is in there.<br/><br/>Not to mention how visually beautiful the movie was. Not only did it have these adorable babes, but the whole world was visually amazing. I loved the use of black&white, with small splashes of colour here and there. Or having a whole person coloured when everything else was b&w. Wonderful way of making the viewer notice the difference between twins for example I just loved those blue eyes of Becky(?) and red shoes of Dwight! I must admit that even though everything was very much cartoon violence, there were some parts that were pretty disturbing to me. I have some problems in seeing people cut to pieces that way... even the bad guys. BUT that did not bother me so much that it would have interfered my enjoyment of the movie as a whole! I really loved the hero characters: Marv, Dwight and Hartigan. Such great guys with their own dark deep secrets. All wishing to do good in their lives and ready to sacrifice themselves for someone they love. But merciless for the people who do bad for their loved ones. Just love that.<br/><br/>The babes were absolutely amazing. The girls of the Old Town were marvellous. Miho with her samurai sword was beautiful, as was their leader Gail, and they were able to take care of themselves these girls, they were not just some brainless chicks. Goldie was really an angel, as was little Nancy.<br/><br/>All in all I loved this movie. And I'm gonna see it again. And buy the DVD."
"tensionpoint","9","1","6","6 June 2005"," The future of comic conversions...finally
","Very rarely do I feel compelled to submit my humble opinions on this website (mainly because I find the anally-retentive, obsessive nature of most posters quite taxing). However, Frank Miller's Sin City has rekindled a passion and respect for ""multiplex "" movies that I had long thought extinguished. For too long Hollywood has churned out rehashed, derivative, production-line mediocrity, with many studios simply seeking money and putting the art firmly in the back seat. To see a film such as this, a film so blindingly fresh, makes me believe there might still be hope.<br/><br/>As an earnest fan of graphic novels and a former film student I have waited in vain for a faithful, unrestrained comic conversion. After numerous disappointments it's finally happened. Despite not being a particular fan of all of Miller's books I have read some of the Sin City novels and found them quite enjoyable. However, I think that the film surpasses it's comic incarnation in some ways. This leads me to comment on some other reviewer's opinions that the film is ""style over substance"". As with any adaptation, the end product can only be representative of the source material. The nature of graphic novels (and comics in general) is very stylised, particularly the violence. Arguably the style IS the substance in that medium. Many people have complained of the excessive brutality in the film. I think this misses the point. I have a strong stomach and admittedly I also found myself feeling a bit bothered by the mindlessness of the characters actions at times. Yet, I found this worked in it's favour and only made the film stronger. After all, isn't violence supposed to be abhorrent and repulsive?<br/><br/>The film's characters and plot threads might not be particularly original. This doesn't matter. It displays it's reference points boldly on it's sleeve. One man's cliché is another mans archetype. This film's freshness comes from the performances and, most obviously, it's striking visual approach. This must be one of the first times I have actually forgotten that I am looking at CGI. No mean feat considering this film is almost entirely green screen. Instead of the usual ""hey, look how clever we are...here's Jar Jar Binks"" approach, the synergy between foreground and background is almost seamless. This is how CGI should be used, to accentuate themes and events, not replace them.<br/><br/>The stellar cast put in admirable performances, most notably Mickey Rourke. This is perhaps his best film since Angel Heart. He sinks his teeth into the role with gusto, much like John Travolta did in Pulp Fiction. It's strange how many actors need to drift into near obscurity before they pull out all the stops. It seems to give them a hunger and poignancy that might otherwise be lacking. Let's just hope the shouts of ""comeback"" don't go to his head! Elsewhere Bruce Willis earns respect as his usual brooding self. Clive Owen was perhaps miscast but is still menacing and very watchable. Benicio Del Toro is as sleazy and majestic as always. Elijah Wood was suitably eerie, without actually uttering anything (perhaps for the best ) and Nick Stahl was equally repellent as The Yellow Bastard. As for the female characters, some people have complained of misogynistic representation. I can see their point but at the same time would ask them to remember the context these characters are in. I would also argue that the female characters are some of the most powerful in the film. In particular Rosario Dawson whose character commands every scene she is in and Devon Aoki who slaughters more people than almost anyone else in the film. If the film is to be considered a homage to Film Noir, I defy anyone to show me an example in that genre where the ""broads"" and ""dames"" are this empowered or don't just swoon helplessly at the leading man.<br/><br/>This really is Miller's vision realised, faithfully and uncompromised. It is exactly the kind of bold audacity and artistic integrity, shown here by Robert Rodriguez and Frank Miller himself, that Hollywood has sorely lacked in recent times. This film is not meant for your average, blockbuster-consuming, movie goer However, why should films try to cater for everyone? After all, most true film fans have favourite genres and tend to stick to them and defend them vehemently. Many films try to appeal to all tastes and usually end up appealing to none. By aiming for such a specific demographic the films creators have shown guts and given a big middle finger to an otherwise played out and stale studio system. Even if you don't like this film you have to respect that"

With one exception, every female character is either a hooker or a stripper, and with no exceptions they all rely on a man to get them out of trouble. Jessica Alba tried to defend the movie in the press by saying she thought all the female characters were ""empowered"". I guess you could see it that way if you considered ""whores with guns instead of pimps"" to be empowerment.<br/><br/>The problem, if one insists on seeing it that way, is the source material. Comic books are one of the last American bastions of chauvinism (along with Tom Clancy novels). Whether you're talking comics or graphic novels, the authors are almost exclusively male, and the intended audience is as well. Women  whether they are heroines, villains, or damsels-in-distress  are there to be provocative and sell copies, and that's about it. Granted Frank Miller has transcended and redefined the genre in many ways, but even he stuck to this standard with Sin City.<br/><br/>Some would accuse the detractors from failing to ""look past"" the violence, chauvinism, and titillation to see the movie's real themes, but there's a fair question of whether the movie is really about these things or just using them to tell the story. In the end they are inseparable, because these stories can't be told any other way. And if someone can do without these stories being told at all, you have to respect that.<br/><br/>As I guy, I would still recommend this movie. It's supposed to show you some dark places."
"iemailbrian-1","7","1","6","5 April 2005"," I think I liked it
","To start, I don't really watch a lot of television, or go to that many movies. I'm a movie renter, skip the commercials. In the 2 hours max that I sit in front of a television per week, I stumbled across the trailer for Sin City. It looked pretty action packed and full of energy, so I thought I'd give it a go at the real theatre. I agree with the previous poster about the artistic talent (both actors and presentation) making this movie different, but the straight up killing is what I enjoyed. Granted, nowadays pretty much all movies have killing in them. That or sex. And yes, this movie has both. It's the way that the kills happen that makes this movie stick out. Or is it the way the women are dressed as they blast bullets into bad guys with no regrets? Or is that part of the way the kills happen? Perhaps it's the way the kills seem so un-un-real? And yes, I meant un-un-real. On one hand, death happens very easily and fast. On the other, death is only an illusion. Perhaps it's about sex then, there were quite a few topless women throughout this movie. No, No, it's about the killing. The fact that it does capture the \ comic book / \ cartoonish / \ fantasy / mood only gets you wanting more. Or does it grasp you into the mindsets of the killers' confusion that quirks your brain to want to know what happens next simply for the fact of satisfying your innate sense to hunt?"
"matz1036","8","1","6","5 April 2005"," Great adaptation
","If there is anything that must be applauded about this movie, it's two major things: The cinematography and the accuracy to the comics.<br/><br/>When I heard about this movie, I immediately hunted down copies of Hard Goodbye and Yellow Bastard. I loved the stories, and when I saw the movie, it was like deja vu. Certain scenes look EXACTLY like the comic, and most others are relatively close. Plus, Clive Owen really looks like Dwight, (I know that because I got A Dame to Kill For,too) Another thing that makes this movie stand out is that it doesn't wuss out. If it happens in the comic, it happens in the movie, no matter how gory or racy. There are two notable exceptions, but they are understandable. One because it would be pornographic if it was in, the other because Jessica Alba won't show her boobs. But that doesn't stop the movie from being the greatest adaptation of a comic to a movie I've seen (and I have seen the Spiderman movies)<br/><br/>I dare say that this movie should win an award for Best Adaptation."
"JimmyG100","9","1","6","2 April 2005"," Sin City, magnificent...
","Having never read any of Frank Miller's Sin City comics before, I can't say I truly appreciated the adaptation that Frank Miller's Sin City movie is. Instead I'm forced to appreciate it on all the other great efforts put into this movie. Sin City is a new kind of magic, not the normal movie magic we're so used to. This is a magic that could only come from a graphic novel... or ""comic book"" if you're looking for the juvenile term. This is a whole new level of live action comic. Rodriguez and Miller didn't film this movie they painted it. Alexis Bledel's beautiful blue eyes, the white blood leaking out of Hartigan, The yellow slime oozing out of the Yellow Bastard. This is a masterpiece of cinematography. The structure and storytelling of it is akin to Pulp Fiction, only Pulp Fiction is much more tame by comparison. A short opening followed by three different yet slightly intertwined stories; Heartigan, Marv, and Dwight and followed by an ending that brings the film about in full circle in a way that I can only compare to Honey Bunny and Pumpkin's destiny with Jules and Vincent in the diner in Pulp. But this is no Pulp Fiction. Better or worse? No, just different. While Pulp Fiction stood out with it's amazing dialog, Sin City's spark comes from what is not said. Unlike any other comic adaptation I've seen, this film takes you inside the characters minds, it doesn't even deserve to be called voice over (or what some would say is a cheap and lazy way to move along narrative in a screenplay). The use of thought in comics is never questioned, and I'm glad Rodriguez and Miller didn't exclude it from the film for what the industry thinks of it. Instead they use it in the only way it should be used, the way Kaufman used it in Adaptation, to take us inside the minds of each character and help us understand them. We may not agree with them, we may not identify with them, but we understand them more than any dialog could help us to. Sin City is a rare thing. See it."
"rswartz-2","10","1","6","2 April 2005"," You have to see it To Believe It!!!
","""Sin City"" is the greatest comic book adaptation of all time. Nevermind 'Spider-Man 2', which is the best SUPERHERO movie ever, But NOT the best COMIC BOOK film ever. <br/><br/>Directed by Robert Rodriguez ('Desperado', 'El Mariachi'), Frank Miller himself (author of 'Sin City' and 'Batman: The Dark Knight Returns'), and featuring a special guest directing job by Quentin Tarantino ('Pulp Fiction' , 'Kill Bill'), 'Sin City' tells three tales (four if you think about it). The stories are 'The Hard Goodbye', 'The Big Fat Kill', and 'That Yellow Bastard'. The cast is spectacular in this film with Mickey Rourke having the biggest impact. There is little humor in the film but what little there is, is very amusing actually. Without giving it away, one of the funniest parts is with Marv (M. Rourke) driving the car and questioning a thug in a very...um...unusual way. ""I don't know about you, but i'm having a blast."" he says. 'The Hard Goodbye' tells the tale of Marv who falls in love with a hooker named Goldie (Jamie King) who went to Marv for protection. He wakes up to find her murdered while they were both sleeping. He then goes on a rampage of revenge and boy, does he find it. He comes across a cannibalistic mute named Kevin who is utterly shocking. Without speaking a word, this boy will give you nightmares. This is all that will be shed about 'The Hard Goodbye'.<br/><br/>'The Big Fat Kill' revolves around Dwight McCarthy (Clive Owen) who is a Private Detective and goes to track down his current girlfriend's ex, Jackie Boy (Benicio Del Toro) who is ruthlessly brutal physically and verbally to Shellie (Brittany Murphy - '8 Mile'), Dwight's new girl. He ends up getting himself in a scenario that endangers the trust in Sin City between the cops, the mob and the prostitutes (who are the only 'innocent and decent' people in the town). He happens to get in trouble when he accidentally kills Benicio Del Toro and fights with himself mentally to figure out if Jackie Boy's decapitated head is talking on its own or just a figment of his imagination. These scenes are highly entertaining! Also features the characters of Becky (Alexis Bledel - TV's 'Gilmore Girls'), Gail (Rosario Dawson - 'Alexander'), and Miho (Devon Aoki - '2Fast 2Furious') in unforgettable roles.<br/><br/>The last story, in my opinion is the best because the characters in the film are all one dimensional yet they are pulled off perfectly. There is not enough time in each story to develop each character so don't look for any. But, in 'That Yellow Bastard', John Hartigan (played perfectly by Bruce Willis, who can play these kinds of roles in his sleep) is a retiring cop out to save one more girl, Nancy Callahan (Jessica Alba - 'Honey') from the clutches of the Senator's pedophilia son, Junior (Nick Stahl - HBO's 'Carnivale', 'Terminator 3'). Hartigan saves her but not before being betrayed by his partner, Bob (Michael Madsen - 'Reservoir Dogs', 'Kill Bill') and soon he is set up and sentenced to 8 years in prison after the system frames him for kidnapping and 3 other crimes that Junior has done. 8 Years pass and Hartigan goes to check on Nancy and finds that she is now 'grown up and filled out'. Quick note: Jessica Alba is SOOOOO MUCH FUN to watch. When the DVD comes out her dancing scenes will be played in slow-mo. Hartigan finds that Junior is now the deformed Yellow Bastard out for revenge. I cannot give out the entire details because this is meant to make you want to see it, not tell you what happens. <br/><br/>Starring: Bruce Willis (Die Hard), Mickey Rourke (Man On Fire), Clive Owen (Closer), Benicio Del Toro (Traffic) in the main roles. Also featuring Josh Hartnett (whose best scene is near the closing), Jessica-I-can-get-you-hot-as-a-DRESSED-Stripper-Alba, Brittany Murphy, Rosario Dawson, Alexis Bledel, Michael Clarke Duncan (Big boy from 'Armageddon' & 'Green Mile'), Michael Madsen, Carla Gugino (who is naked most of the time thankfully), Jamie King (same with her too), Devon Aoki, Rutget Hauer (finally in something NOT straight to video), Powers Booth, Nick Stahl and Mr. Frodo Baggins himself, Elijah Wood as Kevin 'The Cannibal'.<br/><br/>Reminder: 'Sin City' is NOT for the faint of heart!!! This is the bloodiest film i've ever seen with the exception of 'The Passion' and has enough splatter action that would make the D-Day sequence of 'Saving Private Ryan' seem like child's play. Armed to the teeth with decapitations, dismemberment, cannibalism, shootouts giving exit wounds the size of watermelons on the victims, Car crashes, Explosions, Naked gorgeous women (though it's not consistent, just in small parts), a bad ass Private Eye, A determined street fighter and an aging cop with a bum ticker you can't help to accept as a third Grandfather that some of the little girls would have a crush on. <br/><br/>But, With visuals that make you wish for more movies in this style, Robert Rodriguez, Frank Miller, and Quentin Tarantino have crafted a film noir that is so utterly spectacular, you have to see it to believe it."
"ryanreik","8","1","6","1 April 2005"," All I can say is Wow!
","Wow to everything! I can't decide if Frank Miller is a genius, a madman, or both! Robert Rodriguez's adaptation of such a stunning graphic novel was nothing less than stellar given what he was to work with: some of the most technologically advanced graphic software in the movie industry. The use of green screen in this movie was done so tastefully yet so dastardly enough to bring the seedy underworld of Sin City to life. The noir-esque setting mixed with a barrage of cars from Ferraris to 50's T-birds and weapons ranging from ""Dirty Harry"" -like Smith and Westons to modern Uzi brings together such a world never displayed on film before. The tone is somewhat to the feel of, say, ""Pulp Fiction"" while the the brutality being somewhere on the lines of ""The Passion"" or ""Dawn of the Dead"" (for that matter, any modern zombie movie) with the gushing blood, dismemberment, and brutal torture. This movie is for those who enjoy great art and skill, but also who enjoy the occasional severed head or a lady of the night ""going to work"" so to speak.<br/><br/>Those who are fans of Tarintino movies or some of the more gory zombie movies may find some of the more brutal violence mildly yet darkly funny, as I did, and as the violence was meant. Those with weak stomachs, virgin eyes, and strong outward morals and views on censorship, please PROCEED WITH CAUTION.<br/><br/>Great movie for all of those mature enough to see it."
"artist392","8","1","6","1 April 2005"," Definitely worthwhile
","It's unusual to see a movie in black and white with occasional color, not unlike ""Pleasentville"". The movie is a pleasant retreat back to the old 'noire' stories and movies of decades past, but in more of a modern setting. You don't have to be a huge fan of the Frank Miller original stories to enjoy the movie, but admittedly it doesn't hurt. It truly is like finding a totally different world to lose yourself in. As the rating says, you need to prepare yourself for several different levels of violence, but, the black and white appearance of the movie allows for it by cutting down unneeded sensationalism's's of 'blood for the sake of blood.' The stories are good, and the acting of the ensemble very good. People who go to the movie to see 'Frodo', for example, will have a big surprise coming. This role is an excellent counterpoint to the Ring movies for Elijah Wood.He may not have to worry as much about typecasting after this. Overall, not best picture material, but, as it should be, simply enjoyable.It's difficult to find movies to compare this to, without going back to the old Alan Ladd movies of the thirties or so, and even then, what happens in this story couldn't be done then."

","I was impressed by the publicity this movie was having so I sad to myself this has to be something. <br/><br/>First of all I don't read comics, I watch movies and I must say this is one of the most stooped movies I ever saw. I still don't know what genre it is. The dialogs are very stooped, to quote Bruce Willis's character, Hartigan, ""An old man dies. A young girl lives"" which sounds something you invent on the toilet. For me, this line, characterizes the whole movie. <br/><br/>Also 50% of the movie its about women in bikini"", To make it more interesting they are prostitutes with guns that control a part of the city (If that doesn't sound stooped I don't know what does). Nudity is everywhere. <br/><br/>I really suggest people to satisfy themselves before watching the movie because it seems that some people see Jessica Alba's but and they think the whole movie is great, as a man I have to admit the movie has very nice nude scenes but it takes more than that for a such a overrated movie. <br/><br/>There are some characters that make you want to shoot yourself like that played by Elijah Wood (what the hell is up with that thing and what's its purpose), many characters and other stuff"" (I didn't know how to put it) look like they don't belong in this movie (what's with Michael J. Anderson's character, that plastic surgery, why is so important in the movie that he looks like a clown, cant he just have some scars on his face or something). And I don't know who got the idea that people want to see dick's getting shoot but whatever, we can all say that's original. I like to say <br/><br/>I'm not the critic type, I usually go with the flow"" but when it came to Sin City I had to say something (I still can't believe how overrated it is). <br/><br/>Seems they're making a sequel, let hope for the best (nooot...)."

Despite having read the graphic novels, the story, the look, the performances, the score surprised me. From the opening to the end. Without a break. The art direction, the makeup, the cinematography, the performances, even the wardrobes were all of a seamless whole. And everything, all the elements, work together. Sin City is commitment like a knife in the eye: quick, sharp, deadly and you can't do anything about it even when you see it coming. <br/><br/>Sin City is visceral. It calls for thought too. Its social commentary is all tacit, where you don't notice it, fodder for meditations on the meaning of corruption, self-sufficiency, perversion, responsibility, friendship, love, torture, revenge, and defining yourself by your actions. Nothing a bullet won't cure. <br/><br/>I crawled out of the theater stunned, mumbling ""OMFG."" Fellow Sinners staggered into the lobby, shocked. I'm not going to the movies for a while. Sin City leaves them stale, pale, limp, and bland. Who knows when I'll get the metalic taste of blood out of my mouth. <br/><br/>OMFG."

","This is a fantasy also pegged as a fictional city, I would use the word fantasy. Noir films of old depicted real life events in a swish pastry shop way. This film does not. The lives and events are fictional more fanatical really. No real outstanding performances except Mickey Rouke, Excellent job. You have to be a fan of this type of underground comic to really get the point or meaning of what is being portrayed. That is if there really is one. Just like music sometimes it is just entertainment. Other comics like Faust and Razor have violent disturbing visualizations of an exaggerated truth. Again take what ever meaning you want from it, this type film is truly a love it or leave it type of art form. It may opens doors (hopefully) for more gritty capturing stories that go beneath the shelf. Lets face it the next Spiderman or Superman for that matter would never go to these depths. R rated either for the bucks are with the kiddies. Thats why comics like this aren't much understood. But the righteous indignant right will hate it and blame it for countless things wrong with society. But how can they do that when it takes real life horror to exaggerate a fictitious story like this from. Remember the comics code, big brother etc. Read the paper and see the news at night, it's not film that makes people go off. This is escapist entertainment people!"
"Jacques98","1","1","8","31 August 2008"," So ridiculously typical.
","The art style and film-making are truly a masterpiece. The story itself is dull, lame, predictable, cliché, and in the end 100% forgettable.<br/><br/>I'll start with the action. To be blunt, there is hardly any at all. When the action happens it is lame and uninspired. It reminded me of dumbed down action scenes from Spider-Man, but even that is too much of a complement. Most of the film is nothing but people walking around and talking about things that make no difference.<br/><br/>So, with all the talking scenes and characterization scenes you'd expect the plot to be, you know, at least a plot. Oh, how wrong that assumption is. There is no plot. The mini stories that somehow are kind of a plot mixed together are generally boring, and entirely cliché. You've seen these mini stories on cartoons before.<br/><br/>But it doesn't even have the same level of fun, original cartoony feel. It's more like a bad cartoonlike Tom and Jerrythat has grown up but never matured. It just feels . . . awkward and boring. Like a 40-year-old man doing something like a 5-year-old. It's just lame.<br/><br/>This style of mature cartoony-fantasy has been NAILED in video games like Killer 7, which hone the originality and innocence of cartoons, but mix it with mean-spirited ultra-violence. Movies like Kill Bill also get it down. But Sin City simply doesn't know how to do that in a way that isn't boring and cliché.<br/><br/>But, as I said, it's truly a masterpiece in style. Too bad that style wasn't used for something original and cliché-defining, instead of a lame Spider-Man wannabe with some dumbed-down blood to make it seem action packed when I've seen more action watching people walk by my back yard.<br/><br/>. . . and I wish I was joking.<br/><br/>1/10"

","First things first : this film is extraordinarily violent, without there being any sane reason whatsoever for it to be so. It can safely be classified as comic-book gore porn. While watching it, there were at least a dozen occasions when I wanted to hit the 'eject' button on my DVD player ; the only thing that kept me going was simply that I wanted to get it over with.<br/><br/>Is this what art has come to in this age ? Were the filmmakers so desensitized that they went to these levels of harrowing cruelty to titillate their audience ? And just why is this film so chock full of celebrities for roles that a C-List actor would avoid ? Elijah Wood plays something like the ultimate misogynist-cum-cannibal......eh ? That being done with, Sin City is still highly remarkable for its novel and sophisticated filming style. The film was shot on a digital backlot, first in color, which was then converted to high-grade black-and-white, and then desaturated to give it a high contrast. Colour is added in interesting places, like all the girls' eyes, lips, hair, apparel.....you get the point. Oh yeah, and the barrels and barrels of fake blood used here was accentuated to a deep dark red. I also liked how they used CGI only as and when necessary, so the film looks like a cross between a very real and a completely fictional world.<br/><br/>Maybe the film's only true saving grace is that unlike Pulp Fiction and Kill Bill, it doesn't even try passing off as high art ; the film is perfectly aware of itself as being simply low-brow violence for violence's sake, and nothing more. Let me tell you that if you haven't seen this film, save yourself the trouble, you're not missing much. Give your time to something more worthy of it. This film isn't half as clever or funny as it would like to be, and just because a film goes into places with violence that other films don't DOES NOT make it revolutionary or original. It doesn't even matter that Rodriguez supposedly ""stayed true"" to the source material, since the ""source"" in question is jarringly stupid to begin with. This film will most certainly appeal to rapists and women beaters, so if you liked this hunk of sado junk, well......<br/><br/>A friend of mine called Sin City ""misogynistic crap"".

","Some say this movie is dark. No, night is dark, this is darn right bleak! Now I like the cast and the whole film noir look to it or as they call it today Neo Noir. But there are several things that I can't get around, things that I can't suspend my disbelief over. The days of beating a false confession out of someone died a long, long time ago. In this day and age, even if Internal Affairs was also in the Cardinal's back pocket. There's still the Press and the FBI. Besides that, if he's killed in the electric chair, then how can he be narrating the story? What he's telling God his story. Then there's the Senator in the Bruce Willis story, how can he do that? When the President, the most powerful politician in the world can't get away with a simple break in or banging a chubby intern? He can't! He'd never get away with hiding a pedophile Progeny. There's also the grim look at the Church, this is way to dark for me. I look for some ray of hope in my movies. THE NOOSE!"

","How Marve never seemed to die even though he got badly hurt more than 10 times. He just seemed to keep on going and going. He didn't even die up until he got put in the chair the second time around. And he seemed to be a very tough and troubled character. He also seemed to know just about everyone in the film. It got to the point where you didn't even know how he knew all these different people. He was obsessed with trying to find the murderer of Goldie. Which gave no reason as to why she was with him in the first place. She was way to pretty for his ass anyways. In the end I would say he was a very bad character to place in this good movie."

"xx-slay-n-xx","8","0","1","13 April 2020"," Know Thyself, and Stay True
","One important aspect of any media that keeps coming up for me as of late, and appears to be somewhat overlooked, is the ability for a film, TV show or book to know itself. That is to say, they should understand the type of media they are trying to produce and stay faithful to that, not get bogged down in unnecessary cliche and exposition, and use every aesthetic and storytelling tool to realize the premise they started with. The ability to stay true to oneself is up there with dialogue and visuals in terms of its importance in creating a believable and impactful film. There's a reason that everyone from early morning children's cartoons to Lady Gaga tells you to just be yourself. One film that does this exceptionally well is Sin City.<br/><br/>In one respect, Sin City starts with some advantages in this way. To begin with, it is an adaptation of an exceptional graphic novel. The film needed only to stay faithful to the original and it was bound to be something special, and that is exactly what they did, keeping the stunningly contrasting aesthetics and largely including the dialogue. Graphic novels have had a great ability to keep this authenticity. They can take the neo-noir visuals and translate them well onto the big screen in order to keep that feeling of turning pages and viewing something real but not too real. V For Vendetta (2005) and 300 (2006) are some of the best examples of this. The colors and the landscapes are not quite realistic, and the fighting is almost believable. They are clearly comic books in the form of film. Scott Pilgrim vs. the World (2010) has very literal moments of comic visuals, and the fight scenes make no excuses, they are wild and crazy just as we would expect. Sin City captures both of these concepts beautifully. The colorful blood, the ridiculous fighting, the wonderfully overacted dialogue all remind the audience that they are watching a comic book. There are moments to make you say ""What the hell!"" enough for five films.<br/><br/>This is in contrast to comic book adaptations, which are significantly more malleable. Take the Marvel universe. Surely, there are wonderful and revolutionary films, but they take many forms. Ant Man (2015) is a comedy film. The Avengers series is epic sci-fi fantasy. And the Daredevil series on Netflix is a gritty crime drama. This is the advantage of having a huge amount of source material and an extensive canon to work with. You can pick and choose pieces to fit as you need them. Graphic novels are generally a lot more limited, and their ability to stay truthful to the source material is incredibly important in creating something that both new audiences and die-hard fans of the work will appreciate.<br/><br/>The second advantage was having Robert Rodriguez as the director and Quentin Tarantino making a guest appearance. Rodriguez has an excellent ability to keep a film true to its intentions, even if the film itself is not particularly amazing. His later projects after Sin City show this pretty nicely. Planet Terror (2007) is a masterpiece of camp and gross-out horror. It is cartoonish and sarcastic without making any excuse to become realistic or heartfelt. Machete (2010) is a non-stop highlight reel of carnage. Just like the ""fake"" trailer that inspired it, it was ridiculous and amazing. Spy Kids (2001) and Spy Kids 2 (2002), which are altogether mediocre films, should have had no staying power whatsoever. Yet the film's names still resonate with many and the thumb people and guy with four heads still give me nightmares, at least. Somehow the success of these films was enough even to convince a studio to make a fourth installment ten years later.<br/><br/>Sin City stays aware of itself from top to bottom, and from start to finish. The musical accompaniment is perfectly noir. Every actor has bought into the concept as so each character, no matter how minor, plays an important role in making the world (un)believable. The sets are clearly built in some studio, but it doesn't matter. We know that behind the walls is just some wooden paneling holding everything together, just like we know that a book is bound together by glue and threads, but it doesn't stop us from being totally engrossed.
Many films fail to maintain this truthfulness, and that brings them from great movies to something simply good or acceptable. Take, for example, nearly any major Disney Studios release from the last ten to twenty years. The Disney execs are so intent on keeping films inside of a basic and successful formula that they lose their sense of authenticity. They have to shoehorn in romance, rebellion, an evil villain and the hero's journey into any film whether it fits or not, because that is what the audiences want. These movies will always be successful, that's Disney's power, but they rarely get discussed in top lists during the years in review.<br/><br/>Sequels also especially fall into this trap because they stray too far from what they originally intended. Perhaps there is a change in directors, producers or writers, but even when they stay the same this can happen. Take IT (2017) and IT: Chapter Two (2019). What made the original so terrifying was its portrayal of the monster and the feeling of helplessness that was inspired in every audience member. Thirty minutes into the second film, though, this feeling is lost. IT is no longer omnipotent or villainous. He is more mischievous and manipulative. These traits would be okay if the whole construct of this universe didn't hinge on the monstrosity of the villain. IT: Chapter Two has none of the authenticity, and therefore none of the power of the first film.<br/><br/>Sin City is a fantastic film in its own right, but it is a lesson too. A lesson on how to take a concept and run with it for two hours to the very apex of that idea. Perhaps some artists are worried about taking something too far. Well, I say not far enough. Push it to the extreme and see what happens. Let your characters become caricatures if the framework is already a caricature of reality. No one will blame you for making something silly and weird if it makes them think. The feeling of Sin City resonated in my mind for years even before I rewatched it recently. This is not because it stuck to a formula and made some generically marketable, but because it took the truth of itself to the very extreme that it could and made something so cartoonish it became a lifelike work of art."

","In this stylized adaptation of the comic book, Sin City features an all-star cast in over-the-top roles glorifying sex and violence. It's all supposed to be tongue-in-cheek, so be prepared for that type of acting and filmmaking style when you rent it. It's a black and white film with filters and saturations designed to make it look like the drawn pages of a glossy comic book. Occasionally, there are bursts of color, like red blood, that once again bring up the comic book feeling. Visually, if you're a comic book aficionado, you'll probably be in love with this movie.<br/><br/>I'm not, so with the excessive violence and gratuitous sexual themes, I didn't fall in love with this movie. Obviously, in a comic book, it's a necessity for one of the female characters to be a stripper, but to me, most movies that feature strippers film the scenes in an exploitive manner. The movie is segmented into vignettes, and each vignette has an extraordinary amount of violence so that at the end of the movie, you're surprised anyone's left alive to inhabit the city. But if you want to see Bruce Willis, Jessica Alba, Rosario Dawson, Mickey Rourke, Elijah Wood, Benicio del Toro, Michael Clarke Duncan, Clive Owen, Brittany Murphy, Michael Madsen, Josh Hartnett, Marley Shelton, and Alexis Bledel all together in a very stylized movie, you might like it. Watch the preview first, though, so you know what you're getting into.<br/><br/>DLM Warning: If you suffer from vertigo or dizzy spells, like my mom does, this movie will not be your friend.

The Grindhouse films that came out a few years ago was one of the greatest theater experiences I had. I recall being slightly disappointed with Sin City: A Dame to Kill For although it was still decent. After rewatching the film I feel just about the same about the first film; its a wonderful visual experience and wholly engaging.<br/><br/>The film is based on Frank Miller's graphic novel and tells the tale of a few select characters. Themes of revenge and putting out crime are strong in this film. Its a neo-noir film shot in comic book style black and white with select color for some things (such as blood and the Yellow Bastard!). Its stylistically slick, an absolute joy to look at. The film is in noir form so we have the protagonist of each segment telling us what's going on. The film is detailed and violent. Sex blood and fighting reign supreme.<br/><br/>The film has got a load of great characters and actors at the helm. Robert Rodriguez works with some names that he was linked with in the past. This time around I watched what I think was the extended cut of the film. Which I don't actually think was extended but rather each segment was in order with its parts and each segment had ending credits. It doesn't really change the experience of the film and is still just as enjoyable this way.<br/><br/>I can see why Robert Rodriguez planned the sequel. His work usually do get additional films though they often end up being not up to par with the original. Unfortunately, this was the same with A Dame to Kill For. I actually would like to give a sequel a re-watch though as I may have more positive feelings about it at this time. All I know is that Robert Rodriguez should get credit for going outside the box with his work, sometimes it doesn't work but at least he attempts to be innovative.<br/><br/>8/10"

","Sin City (2005) Reviewed by Martin Davis, Retrospect Film on Facebook.<br/><br/>Based on Frank Millers graphic novels of the same name and co- directed by Miller and Robert Rodriguez, 'Sin City' is one of modern American cinemas most visually stylish and unique films. Shot almost entirely in black and white but with occasional flashes of brilliant colour, the film tells the four interlinked stories of several different characters, all caught up in the corruption and violence of Basin City, the 'Sin City' of the title. On the eve of his retirement, Police Detective John Hartigan (Bruce Willis) rescues a young girl, Nancy Callahan (Makenzie Vega), from a sadistic killer named Junior (Nick Stahl). Junior, it transpires, is the son of the powerful and corrupt Senator Roark (Powers Boothe) and with Nancy denied the right to testify, Hartigan is subsequently framed and then imprisoned for Juniors crimes. Having refused to plead guilty and lessen his sentence, Hartigans' only solace comes from the letters he receives from Nancy. When the letters stop arriving and Hartigan learns that, the now adult, Nancy (Jessica Alba) is once again in danger from Junior he confesses his guilt in order to gain early release and once again come to her rescue. Meanwhile elsewhere in town, Marv (Mickey Rourke) wakes up next to the dead body of his beloved Goldie (Jaime King) and, like Hartigan, finds himself framed for a crime he didn't commit. Marv is a violent brute of a man but he has a strong moral code and is determined to seek out the truth and avenge Goldies murder, a mission that will ultimately lead him to Cardinal Patrick Henry Roark (Rutger Hauer), the senators brother. Next we meet Dwight McCarthy (Clive Owen) and his new love Shellie (Brittany Murphy) who is under threat from her violent ex- boyfriend Jackie Boy (Benicio Del Toro) and his thugs. In protecting Shellie, Dwight finds himself embroiled in a bitter war being engaged between Jackie Boys' gang and the girls of Old Town, who have an uneasy truce with the City Police Department. The film opens and closes with the tale of an unnamed stranger (Josh Hartnett) and the fatal love affair with his mysterious but also anonymous lover (Marley Shelton). A long awaited sequel, Sin City: A Dame to Kill For, arrived in 2014 and although matching the first film in style it inevitably lacked much of what made the original so unique. With its stunning cinematography, excellent cast and gripping story lines 'Sin City' is terrific entertainment. Martin Davis, Retrospect Film on Facebook."

","The use of colour in this is very interesting and while it does resemble the feel of a comic book sometimes, it also feels very noir- I guess you could call it neo noir. This made the aesthetics of the film quite attractive as it was creative and different from other films. The black and white contrasts is more than just black and white, it's an intense black and white. This adds to the noir and expressionistic atmosphere of the film which reflects the dark narrative. <br/><br/>Uses of other colour (like red, green, blue) is very vibrant and does not seem to have narrative purpose. In most instances, there is only one part in the scene that is of colour (like a dress, or the eyes) which instantly catches the attention of the audience. However, it seems to be randomized, like the creators of the film wanted to experiment with colour and added some whenever they felt like it. The colours are very saturated and intense too, further capturing our attention. <br/><br/>The story is quite gruesome, and while I went into the film with no knowledge about what it's about, the settings help foreshadow the goriness. There is so much violence in this that 'Sin City' truly lives up to its name. I could have used without all that gore, but it was somewhat bearable to watch. Only a few instances did I have to look away from disgust. Also because it gives off the feel of a comic book (in that what is happening is fiction), that helps to digest some of the images shown. <br/><br/>Apart from the creative use of colour, the editing, soundtrack and mise-en-scene (or digital intermediate) helped in creating the world of Sin City. Everything complemented each other well and just hearing the soundtrack alone reminds me of a video game. The editing and digital manipulations emphasized further the image of a comic book with non-realistic animation/movements and obvious digital backdrops. The cinematography does a fantastic job in keeping the audience engaged with its dynamic movements. As a whole, the film gives a visually stunning performance with aesthetic appeal. <br/><br/>Additionally, all the actors and actresses did their parts well. I have a problem with the gender roles in this but will say nothing more on that matter. The voice of each different protagonist in each mini short (in the extended cut) is very similar to each other. The tone that is used establishes an alpha male in a sort of identity crisis, but who always plays the hero saving the damsel in distress. I like that the tone is consistent throughout as it gives the sense of continuity, but on the other hand, these different characters tend to blend into one another so that it could be one person/character."
"Mr-Fusion","7","0","3","24 November 2015"," Frank Miller: The Movie
","Comic book movie or not, ""Sin City"" has got style coming out of its pores. It's a vast understatement to call this an adaptation; translation is more apropos, as if Robert Rodriguez physically lifted the content from the page and threw it up on the big screen. Whole panels are right up there for all to see. If Frank Miller painted the figurative picture of a city that no sane person would want to live in, the movie does it justice and adds the necessary realism to populate it with Hollywood actors. Its only weakness is that the viscera bogs things down after a while.<br/><br/>But this movie's a treat for the cast alone, which is top-notch. Mickey Rourke and Bruce Willis are ideal choices for Marv and Hartigan (respectively). Rosario Dawson's warrior woman is something else (man, oh man). I can't really think of a weak like in this group. I have to say that Brittany Murphy was my favorite here; she has the toughness and the vulnerability for the role, but she also has a real presence. That says an awful lot when she's able to stand out among heavy hitters like these.<br/><br/>7/10"
"skepticskeptical","6","0","2","26 September 2015"," Aesthetic Depiction of Extreme Violence
","The use of color is very appealing in this film, which otherwise would be just a long concatenation of extreme violence and viciousness. Very Tarantino-esque, which makes sense, since he was one of the directors. Everything is in black and white, but it all shimmers like silver, evoking the aesthetics of fascism. The difference is that each scene gives a bright and saturated color (like wet paint) to one element: the color of blood, or a person's eyes, or someone's skin... The color draws attention to that element and produces a very pleasing image, even when atrocious acts are being committed.<br/><br/>Sadism abounds. There is no real distinction between the good and the evil people when it comes to their use of violence. In fact, each regards his enemy as evil and himself as good. Just as in reality. The suggestion is that there are no true moral divisions. Everyone is ready and willing to inflict pain and suffering on everybody else. <br/><br/>The plot? Just a long string of senseless acts of violence connected by their location in Sin City, aptly named. Hookers and criminals and sexual perverts and serial killers: they are all here. Some seem nicer than others, but they are all ready, willing, and able to destroy other people for one reason or another, and they all relish the prospect of doing so."

","Sin City (2005): Dir: Frank Miller, Robert Rodriguez / Cast: Bruce Willis, Mickey Rourke, Clive Owen, Benicio Del Toro, Jessica Alba: Overwhelming comic book film eye candy presented in black and white with red and green tinted colour. Nothing positive exits but only hate, revenge and murder. Bruce Willis plays a cop with a heart condition out to rescue a young girl but is betrayed by his partner. Mickey Rourke goes on a killing spree after a lady friend is murdered. Clive Owen tracks down corrupt cops lead by Benicio Del Toro, which leads to an area run by combat women. Jessica Alba plays the grown version of the woman whom Willis saved in the film's opening. He must break out of jail to secure her safety but feels it is worth the price of his life. Directed by Frank Miller and Robert Rodriguez to their stylish best with every scene in black and white with colour tints. The cast survive the violence by portraying intriguing individuals. Besides Willis, there is Rourke's hell raising trek for vengeance. Owen clashes with corrupt law led by Del Toro whose severed head causes bizarre images. Jessica Alba appears as an exotic dancer. She is the grown version of a girl seen earlier in the film. The violence is unfortunately meaningless graphic revenge but its visual delivery results in a great looking comic book adaptation wallowing in sin and celebrating its access. Score: 6 / 10"
"ahegde3149","7","0","1","19 May 2015"," Brutally violent, not to be taken seriously.
","Based on the famous comic book series with the same name (which I haven't heard of till I saw the film), Sin City is a brutally violent film set in the overly fictitious Basin City. One must not even remotely try to compare it with reality and just take it as comic book entertainment where unimaginable things can happen. The narrative consists of 4 short story-lines linked together in a particular sequence, similar to Pulp Fiction. Yet, it fails to achieve the same level of excellence with clichéd script and overly stylized action. I saw the directors extended cut where each of the 4 stories are completely separated, you can go for it if you can handle the long credits after each story (which was ridiculous). <br/><br/>The first story 'That Yellow Bastard' follows the story of Hartigan (Bruce Willis), an honest cop who is in danger after facing off with the corrupt senators son. The second 'The Customer is always right' wont make any sense till you see the entire film. The third 'A Hard Goodbye' follows Marv (Mickey Rourke), a bad-ass hunk who is almost impossible to kill. He plans to get rid of a even more horrific cannibal-killer Kevin (Elijah Wood). The last one, 'The Big Fat Kill', follows Dwight (Clive Owen) who has to handle a delicate situation between cops and the kick-ass girls of Old Town. The ones with Bruce Willis and Mickey Rourke were the best. Acting wise the cast is fabulous and has the commendable job. There are lots of things you need to link in order to get a proper linked story out of the 4 stories and the sequel (A dame to kill for). I would recommend forget it and just enjoy each story individually as in the end all of it wont make preach you anything. Everything is to be perceived only as entertainment nothing else. The level of violence is extreme. Each character feels like a nihilist. A persons head is smashed to pulp with bare hands, a mans hands and legs are cut and is fed to wolf alive. If you can handle such violence well and good, else don't bother to watch. The visual style of black & white with color to highlight works well with the neo-noir theme of the film. The dialogues feel a bit too cheesy at times and action sequences unrealistic. Anyways its just a comic book adaptation. Just enjoy it like that.<br/><br/>RATING: [3.5/5]"

","My son gave me this movie with the assurance I would like it. I was completely unfamiliar with the genre of graphic comics/novels, Frank Miller, etc so you can imagine that after about 15 minutes I was wondering just what kind of person he though his old man really was. Once I recognized the nature of the production I was able to settle in and enjoy the show.<br/><br/>My son was right, I enjoyed it immensely. Though gratuitous violence and gore aren't my style of entertainment, once I accepted it as more or less comic-book excess I really focused on the characters, dialog and individual performances. Mickey Rourke's portrayal as a hulking mountain of man-stink and physicality was extraordinary. Jessica Alba's glowing, self-assured combination of innocence and sexual allure was almost unendurable. Benicio del Toro's raspy, slimy character was as despicable and hate-able as any I have seen in cinema - or real life for that matter.<br/><br/>""Not for everyone"" is a well-deserved codicil for this film, but for those who like an in-your-face exhibition of the seamy side of humanity and aren't easily offended will find this a real pearl."
"JSValentine","8","0","2","5 March 2015"," An excellent film that is also a work of art
","Prior to watching Sin City, I was sceptical as to how successful it would be. My reservations were mainly based on the fact that, from what I had read, the film seemed extremely ambitious, and often such films fall flat and disappoint thanks to an inability to live up to their stellar expectations. Sin City however, does not fall into this category. If anything, it surpassed both its own ambitions and my expectations. <br/><br/>Firstly, the acting was fantastic, the personal favourites of mine being Mickey Rourke, Carla Gugino and Bruce Willis. They all brought different elements to the table, but all displayed an incredible capacity for playing empathetic and emotionally complex characters alongside the more light-hearted art-house sequences.<br/><br/>However, the most impressive element of Sin City has to be the cinematography and artistic direction. Being a fan of graphic novels, the way that Frank Miller managed to translate a comic onto the big screen whilst losing almost none of the raw aesthetic and intense beauty of the original genuinely astounded me. The film maintains the typical graphic novel elements such as overriding themes of justice and conflict alongside dry humour and spectacular set pieces to create a unique cinematic experience.<br/><br/>Not simply appealing for those who enjoy graphic novels, Sin City is a visually stunning and altogether magnificent film."

","""Sin City"" is pure film noir and crime pulp and one of the best — if not the best — comic book adaptations brought to film ever done. Extreme brutality and full of rampant violence, visually arresting cinematography, and nothing short of pure genius. Robert Rodriguez uses a combination of live action performed by real actors while incorporating a technique of colorization and filming in black in white to transform Frank Miller's graphic novels into moving pictures. There isn't a screenplay written for the film --instead-- it's more like a comic book brought to life and pumped with steroids. While other directors have attempted to remain faithful to the look and ""feel"" of their source material, Robert Rodriguez has taken things a step further by using Frank Miller's graphic novels as storyboards and immersing the audience neck-deep in the noir currents of Miller's immorality. The end result is a one-of-a-kind film that's both incredibly offensive and undeniably entertaining,"
"JackRice100","8","0","1","31 October 2014"," Great, dark and violent film done originally!
","Sin City is a film cut into three smaller parts/short films which I really liked. The first story is about a cop played by Bruce Willis who is out to help and protect an 11 year old girl from a deformed paedophile. The next story is about a compete beast of a man looking for the people who killed his beloved girl Goldie and tried to frame him for it. The last and frankly my least favourite but still awesome in its own right, is a story of Dwight (Clive Owen) and how he nearly started a street war between a group of prostitutes and a group of mercenaries, the police, and the mob. What I really liked about this film is that its three short story's that you can watch singly or as a whole this is because at the end of each story were end credits which completely caught me off guard I have to admit but on reflection I loved it it was great and just one of the things that makes this film so original and like no other before it. People say its like Pulp Fiction and to an extent it is but in Pulp Fiction you get one whole film that you could clearly see where each story overlapped and met over, for me at least, it wasn't as clear in Sin City, but because its done differently doesn't take anything away from the film. First two stories were completely gripping and had me glued to the screen from the off. The last one was still really good but because I found the first two characters were so interesting and the characters were so cool and compete bad asses I just wanted to see what they would do next and at the start of the third it was very much the same but after getting introduced to the group of prostitutes it lost a bit of focus off the main character of Dwight which was a shame as the scenes he had alone where completely brilliant and really good to watch. The script was brilliantly put together iv read that they took a lot out of the comics which if true is brilliant and props for them for doing so. I have to mention how good this film looks, it looks absolutely stunning and feels like your just in the comic and just watching all the frames of the book flash past your eyes, it's great. Sadly if the last story kept me as glued to the screen as the first two did i would of given it a high 9 possibly a ten. Overall I thought it was a really great movie and beautifully done."

As I look at the first book, the hard goodbye I was excited to find a world that was torn from the panels and made into my all time favorite graphic novel adaptation. The only times I was disappointed was the prosthetics on Mickey Rourke. My favorite story line was the big fat kill with Clive Owen as Dwight it is well done with a scene by director Quentin Tarantino and adds a creepy scene which adds to the enjoyment I had during the film with Dwight and Jackie boy played by Benicio del toro.

Ce have comic book action where cars literally bop over the city outskirts and I can not understate the enchantment of the visuals. Robert Rodriguez and Frank Millers together ensure that Sin City is also just a cliché filled teen aged fantasy where the girls have different faces but similar young and gyrating bodies before age starts to settle in. This fantasy is a blend of three leading stories whose stars' voices almost become one run-on monologue that is a blend of understated tough man and sleep inducing mantra. I get it. That's how the leading men are written in the stories now on screen. It's an over kill of overkill, however and while the mythology of Sin City must surely be intact, so is the stunted maturity."
"CinemaClown","Null","0","1","22 April 2014"," Something Never Done Before. Something Never Seen Before. Something Never Experience Before.
","Adapting a comic book series on the film canvas is one thing but transitioning it into a live-action motion picture in a manner that it brings the comic book to life in an almost literal sense while mirroring the events of the novel frame to frame is something truly extraordinary. And that's what Sin City is; something never done before, something never seen before & something never experienced before.<br/><br/>Based on Frank Miller's graphic novel series of the same name, Sin City is presented in 3 primary chapters (That Yellow Bastard, The Hard Goodbye & The Big Fat Kill), each lifted directly from the novel & is presented in a non-linear & overlapping order (unless you're watching the recut, extended & unrated version). A non-related short segment named The Customer Is Always Right also exists but it only serves in bookending the whole narrative.<br/><br/>Directed, produced, photographed, edited & scored by Robert Rodriguez, Sin City remains the most accomplished film of his career. Also sharing the direction credit is Frank Miller himself & Quentin Tarantino is in as guest director for filming one scene. Cinematography is jaw-dropping gorgeous n groundbreaking, editing is deftly carried out & music is perfectly suitable. In short, Sin City is a marvel of technical filmmaking & an astonishing work of cinematic art.<br/><br/>Featuring an ensemble cast of Jessica Alba, Rosario Dawson, Brittany Murphy, Devon Aoki, Jaime King, Alexis Bledel, Bruce Willis, Mickey Rourke, Clive Owen, Elijah Wood, Benicio del Toro & many more, everyone delivers a fantastic performance but the standouts for me were Rourke & Wood, both featured in my favourite story of the three; The Hard Goodbye. While Rourke impresses the most as the unstoppable beast, Marv, Elijah followed him closely with his sinister rendition of Kevin; a mute cannibalistic serial killer.<br/><br/>Sin City may not be a flawless film on an overall scale but it still remains one of the most stylish, inventive, faithful, original & visually path-breaking films to come out in the 21st century. An extraordinary achievement in genre-filmmaking & a breathtaking cinematic ride from start to finish, this visual extravaganza from Rodriguez & Miller that's no less a cinematic feat is a must for every cinema lover out there. An instant classic. An unforgettable experience. A technical masterpiece."
"sl-spencer","8","0","1","8 March 2014"," Visionary Re-Invention of Film Noir
","It's really hard to say anything bad about this film. Rodriguez and Miller were faithful to the source material and found an effective way to bring comic panels to the big screen. The acting is good to exceptional and this was a risky idea all the way through (the idea of casting Mickey Rourke alone). Perhaps the only thing might have been some of the actors, Josh Hartnett seemed dull, Alexis Biedel seemed lost, and Clive Owen had a hard time ditching the accent. One thing most people tend to overlook is how much of a comeback this was for Frank Miller, after his problems with the major studio system. Overall a stunning achievement, worthy of more praise."

","I stumbled across this visually haunting noir film by accident and got hooked immediately. Never a big fan of the noir genre', I instantly loved the visuals, characters and plot though I think it's a bit too violent; everything else pretty much makes up for that however and I can be a bit squeamish. In fact the excessive violence (which could have been alluded to at times) was the only reason I didn't give this stunner a 10. It's kind of like a Manga gore-fest. Sin City is also an example of great casting with the amazing Rosario Dawson and Clive Owen among the super talented cast. It just looked like they were enjoying themselves in their characters, something I appreciate greatly in film. If you have a strong stomach and want something actually engaging and different than superhero movies, check out Sin City."

I found myself sympathizing with several characters. It especially broke my heart to see my darling Brittany Murphy perform so perfectly knowing she's gone. R.I.P. princess. <br/><br/>Basin City is a stinking, rotting, malevolent cesspool of filth and darkness. There are three story lines each containing a generous amount of violence, wit, and raw human emotion. Then again, the characters of Basin City seem almost emotionally exhausted. Perhaps what I mean to say is the portrayal of humans who have hit rock bottom is spot on in this film. Each main character has a very dark past and their current mission is one of pure revenge while some may view it as retribution. <br/><br/>Personally, I was fully engaged in this movie from start to finish.

"boblangill","9","0","1","11 September 2013"," My #1 Guilty Pleasure
","Some movies are so deep, so subtle, you can watch them over and over, and pick up something new every time. Sin City isn't like that. Flash Gordon was my former number one guilty pleasure. When I watched it, and now, when I watch Sin City, the fun comes from seeing the same things each time: when I hear Marv tell a guy ""That's a nice coat you're wearing,"" I know the guy's in big trouble. Although it never happens, I half expect to hear Marv tell Cardinal Roark, ""That's a nice robe you're wearing."" <br/><br/>Maybe I shouldn't call it a guilty pleasure. Siskel and Ebert both gave it thumbs up, but this movie aims at being low-brow. Usually, good drama comes from good villains. Sin City villains are all one-dimensional. They are bad, mean, nasty people. They run everything, run over everyone, and have an exaggerated sense of justification for what they do. We want them to die slow, horrible, painful deaths. As Marv puts it ""I love hit men. No matter what you do to them, you don't feel bad."" <br/><br/>While the villains do whatever they want, the heroes: Marv, Hartigan, and Dwight McCarthy are all driven by a strong sense of obligation. They can't just walk away from the situations they're in. They have to squeeze some justice and fairness out of it; at least, they have to try. Marv is the one most willing to do monstrous things, but, despite the fact that he has ""a condition"", he's also the one who most clearly spells out what people should or shouldn't do.<br/><br/>Sin City is a graphic novel put in motion. The story telling uses graphics and plenty of violence. There's violence, but it isn't gratuitously displayed. The most violent parts are masked by graphics or related to us . . . ""it wasn't until I showed him all those pieces of himself. . ."" In addition to masking violence, the graphics set a tone and context that straight cinematography won't give you. Right in the opening scene, the rain makes an appearance that sets a tone and tells a story.<br/><br/>Graphics pull us into Sin City's unreal world that has very real people in it. That's why I visit so often."

Actually it's the exact opposite this is a masterpiece of a movie, and high up on my Top 100 Movies List. http://www.IMDb.com/list/AoqmUADYknU/ What makes this such a clever, awesome, intellectual movie is not just the thick plot, amazing CGI and cool action sequences. It's the characters. One hour in and we already know how most of them behave and their intricate back stories. Just for the people who haven't seen this movie (YET) their are a lot of characters, so many that Michael Madsen isn't even in the main character list! Although most people say that their isn't a main character in sin City, I would disagree and say that Bruce Willis is the centre of the story NO SPOILERS to what he does and what happens to him. But it's very unexpected and the most interesting scene in the film the way it's filmed is Oscar worthy. Overall I would say that Sin City is one of the best movies of all time, mainly because of the intricate cast and brilliant special effects. 8.8/10 4 and a half stars"

","Now I understand why guys like Jessica Alba and girls like Clive Owen. :) The tableau includes a strong sense of characterization.<br/><br/>Some critics have been shy about making the conclusion that Sin City is in fact film noir by simply stating that the film contains some noir elements, but ultimately shying away from the bold inclusion into film noir. In looking at the criteria from Neale it seems that Sin City not only qualifies, but might be the quintessential film noir. Sin City contains not just many of those qualities, but exhibits all of them. I will go through each element individually and place it in its Sin City context.<br/><br/>Creativity - perfect.

","Robert Rodriguez just Brought to life the comic book, with some steroids. Without wishing to belittle Robert Rodriguez, but this time he had help from his dear friend Quentin Tarantino and Frank Miller screenplay. ""Sin City"" is a comic book by Frank Miller made ​​in 1991, with 6 editions, which tells the story of several characters in this dangerous city at the same time, along with the consequences of their choices and a violent history and romance. To bring this to life course had to seek help from the author himself to develop the story, and ask for help to Tarantino to add a delicious violence without exaggeration. We have the story based on the first edition of Sin City, ""The Hard Goodbye"" where we see the story of a cop (Bruce Willis) trying to prove his innocence in a crime of rape against a little girl who did not commit. And who ends up falling in love with her ​​years later, on the other hand we see the story of an ex-cop (Clive Owen) trying to help his mistress against the drunk boyfriend, which ends up turning into a chase against time and a gang war. On the other side we see a ""good mercenary"" (Dolph Lundgrenque) who investigates the death of his girlfriend, killed during the night while they made love. Fantastic stories that intersect throughout the film, with an excellent cast with fun characters and exciting that will hold up from start to finish.

","Sin City, Frank Miller, Robert Rodriguez,and Quentin Tarantino (special guest director), 2005 <br/><br/>Frank Miller's comic book comes to life in a movie that has all the elements of noir but none of the sensibilities. It's quite a leap from the gritty realism of noir to comic book figures who are just affectations of the basic noir characterizations, but this one isn't shy about making the attempt. And it has all the elements: voice-over, tough guys, dangerous femmes, hard-boiled dialog, fringe characters, the 'bad part of town,' nihilism, and a dark ending that resolves nothing. <br/><br/>The film makes no apologies about being a comic book which is, after all, a big part of its appeal for its fans. And the cast is top notch with more beautiful women than I can remember seeing in a film - ever. And the tough guys - there are three of them - are tough like only comic book characters can be (those guys can either take a punch or they were shot with really small bullets). But, really, they all come off as cheap knock-offs of noir characters. But hey, it's a comic book. <br/><br/>And the movie is lots of fun. Jessica Alba's cowgirl bar top dance is a great Hollywood moment as she pulls off something that can't be easy: very effectively playing a stripper without taking her clothes off. There really is no plot just three loosely woven story lines but it really doesn't matter. This film caters to adolescent male fantasies about violence and women. <br/><br/>But the movie is what it is.

Frank Miller's Sin City comic stories are a loving homage to the Mickey Spillane variety of pulp crime novels, and a showcase for the chiaroscuro technique and brilliant use of negative space that he had experimented with for years in the pages of Daredevil and Batman. Co-director Robert Rodriguez has taken three of Miller's stories and used the panels as the storyboards for the film adaptation, almost without alteration. The result is a mélange of film noir and the pulpiest of pulp crime novels into a new and extremely stylish piece of crime drama that is relentlessly entertaining.<br/><br/>Miller's potent black humor translates easily to the screen and lifts the often grim subject matter, keeping the film entertaining through the darkest of landscapes. And it does get extremely dark – figuratively and literally. Sin City is a world of shadows, captured in beautiful black and white digital photography, where the sun never seems to rise. Rodriguez and Miller delight in sending their heroes into labyrinthine hells almost beyond imagining. It would be depressing if it weren't so much fun.<br/><br/>Into this frenzied mix, Rodriguez has brought his own visual talents to create one of the most stylized films in years. He follows Miller's panels in lighting and composition, but adds his own sense of timing and splashes of color to create something new – call it film noir pent. It's Rodriguez strongest and most assured film since From Dusk Till Dawn. Quentin Tarantino steps in to guest direct a tense car sequence where dead Jack Rafferty becomes the voice of Dwight's nagging self- doubt."

","Sin City is a tremendously ambitious work from Robert Rodriguez, a director who formally only made films on his terms, leading to many films that were all entertaining but reasonably similar.<br/><br/>With Sin City he changed things up, shot entirely on green screen in black and white with an entirely computer generated backdrop, and utilising only sporadic use of colour to highlight certain aspects and features, Sin City looks like almost nothing before it. (It was tried again by the Co-Director Frank Miller in The Spirit, with less than satisfactory results.)<br/><br/>The events that occur over the two hour running time are taken from three comics *AHEM* graphic novels created by Frank Miller, whose vivid imagery and odd angles apparently convinced and influenced Rodriguez' own shot selection to the point he gave Miller co-credit.<br/><br/>The graphic novels are set in the fictional BaSin City (hence the title), where crime, corruption and general naughtiness are commonplace and everyone has a story to tell generally not a nice one.<br/><br/>The characters also think (and in the film talk) in short sentenceswith much use of and precious little wasted dialogue because comics are about the pics as much as the story<br/><br/>The three stories intertwine quite nicely and wrap around so that everything is resolved in the most satisfactory way possible, with each story occasionally momentarily touching upon events from other tales, though not directly.<br/><br/>The first story follows grizzled veteran cop Hartigan (Bruce Willis) as he closes in on the abductor of an eleven year old girl named Nancy.<br/><br/>The second story follows the exploits of Marv (Mickey Rourke), a hulking, disfigured thug with anger issues, a drug dependency and perhaps mental problems – no wonder Mickey Rourke got rave reviews he was playing himself!<br/><br/>The final tale involves a young waitress (Brittany Murphy), her violent prick of an ex Jackie-Boy (Benicio Del Toro) and her new flame Dwight (Clive Owen), and the subsequent trip that Jackie-Boy and Dwight take separately to Old Town, a scungy area that is run by the local hookers.<br/><br/>The sparse use of colours only serves to highlight the reds and yellows when they are used, and even without colour the black and white film is exceptionally clear, even in the rain sequences.<br/><br/>Each tale has its own share of depraved acts, dialogue and violence, with the oft spewing blood exceptionally lurid as it gushes over the screen in bright red yellow and white! The violence is more over the top than most manga films, with decapitations, torture and various severings and shootings.<br/><br/>Before you ask ""well how bad could it be"" consider the following short list of characters: - An emotionless silent mass-murdering cannibal - A deformed miscoloured paedophile - A tiny Japanese assassin-hooker (or is it hooker-assassin?)<br/><br/>And that's before I get to the cops, thugs, heavies, crimelords and the usual minions and sacrificial lambs.<br/><br/>An All-Star cast fill the film with recognisable faces even in minor roles, without running down the laundry list though highlighted actors include Bruce Willis, Mickey Rourke, Clive Owen and Jessica Alba (whose contract as a stripper specified no-nudity bitch!).<br/><br/>Sin City is never boring but rarely hits any great heights, you say Wow to everything on screen but rarely to any one moment or action – though there are some gruesome eye raising moments and a couple of effective action sequences.<br/><br/>Sin City is perhaps best described as a great achievement – if not a great film but I welcome a sequel as I think this material has a great film somewhere in it.<br/><br/>Final Rating – 8 / 10. Violent, noirish and filled with people you wouldn't invite to dinner even on a dare. Everyone in Sin City has a story, hopefully the sequel finds better ones."

","I first watched this movie on Spike a couple years ago and I was eager to watch because I remember there being a lot of hype put into it when it was released. I have never read the graphic novels it's based off of or any of Frank Miller's works but I still enjoyed this film more than any other film in the last decade.<br/><br/>There are three stories in this film and each have brilliant acting performances and thrilling and sometimes shocking imagery. I personally liked the hard goodbye the most. Mickey Roarke completely threw himself into the role and is one of the most bad ass characters I've ever seen in a movie.<br/><br/>The movies' visuals are amazing and iconic, and I feel they marketed an Oscar nomination. The action scenes are intense and violent.<br/><br/>This is without a doubt Robert Rodriguez's best film and it's guaranteed not to bore anyone."

","Sin City is one of the most beautifully shot movies that I have seen in such a long time. It stays true to the original graphic novels in every way. The film was shot in black and white with a few additions of colour. That is what makes Sin City different from other screenplays that are adapted from either comic books and graphic novels It is easily one of Robert Rodriguez's top feature films. It has a list of top notch A-list actors, including Bruce Willis, Michael Madsen and Mickey Rourke. Bruce Willis was amazing detective Hartigan. And hands off to Mickey Rourke as Marv. He is such a bad-ass. He played his role quite well and with a lot of attitude. Definitely on my list of most liked films. Sin City is worth a watch and time well spent."
"itamarscomix","10","0","1","13 November 2011"," Style Over Substance
","Probably no other film deserves the title 'comic book movie' more than Sin City, though it has no men in tights and capes. It adapts Frank Miller's classic pulp stories lovingly and faithfully, to the point of using the comics themselves as a storyboard, often recreating frames down to the smallest details. More impressively, though, it manages to maintain the original atmosphere, and to create a total 'comics' feel despite the fact that it plays within a genre usually associated with film.<br/><br/>It needs to be said that Sin City is, to all intents and purposes, trash. It's stupid, it's violent, it's sexist, it has all its plot devices deeply rooted in the clichés of film noir and crime pulps. It's a classic case of style over substance - but with so much style, it really doesn't matter. Back in 2005 Sin City's stylish use of CGI was revolutionary, in that it used it to create a unique look rather than try imitate reality or even surreality; and it still stands out today as one of the most beautiful films ever made, where every single frame is a work of art. But in contrast with the other two Frank Miller-involved movies - 300 and The Spirit, both of them gorgeous as well - Sin City isn't just a series of pretty pictures, it excels also in perfect pacing, that makes sure the viewer is excited, pumped up and glued to the screen constantly. In fact, it's one of the best action movies seen in the 2000's, one which has its roots in the true classics of the genre rather than the modern Michael Bay-induced plague of slow motion, explosions and jittery camera.<br/><br/>Sin City is a must watch for cinema lovers and design enthusiasts. It shouldn't be taken too seriously - anyone raging about the movie being predictable or unoriginal isn't really saying much. It's all about visuals and style, and as such it's one of the most amazing and unique films ever made."

","This film doesn't follow the standard linear plot line you all grew up to know and love. Instead we watch 3 main stories unfold, and understand the entity that is ""Sin City"". In each story we have reoccurring characters, locations, and scenery. At some points in the film you have this feeling that everything will come crashing down on each other, but it doesn't. Now, whether this was a deliberate decision to split the entire story between this and the 2 future films to come or not, we don't know. Regardless, it is a fun ride.<br/><br/>This film is a great example of neo-noir; With all the violence, beautiful women, color schemes, set designs (cough cough cgi), and of course my favorite, the anti-hero. Needless to say Rodriguez and Miller left there own touch to the possible genre-film. This is probably the best adaptation of a graphic novel to film I have seen.<br/><br/><ul><li>Chase </li></ul><br/><br/>sundaywiththegiants.blogspot.com"

","*** out of (****)<br/><br/>Dismemberment. Incest. Grit. ""Sin City"" is a completely unadulterated production that's as slick and mouth watery as you can get, thanks to its hip direction and its mere complexity. It's unapologetic, but that's what makes the ride more fun. The best part of ""Sin City"" is that it's a whole beast of its own. It has all the requirements to being a solid film, acting, story, and direction wise. But it plays tribute to film noir, graphic novel adaptations, and most significantly, it's just ingenious. However, how far can ingenious get you without pretension seeping through the cracks? ""Sin City"" is a ride that must be taken, but it isn't without its self-awareness, and that alone, is the reason why it's imperfect. Still, for a film of this nature, self-awareness is not what you should be looking for.<br/><br/>First, and for most, the performances are just top notch. Everyone hear brings a worthy performance to the table. Also, I like the variation in character dispositions. You have characters who can be snarky and snooty, ones with bells and whistles, and others who blur the line between good and evil. Moreover, the plot is a well constructed one. I had to revisit the film to pick up on some information I couldn't quite pick up on the first round. To put the cherry on the top, the cinematography is just sick. The clear showcasing of juxtaposition in color is simply awe-inspiring. <br/><br/>While ""Sin City"" is quite the adrenaline rush, one should be aware of its harsh nature. Ears blown off, shoot outs, decapitations, and the good 'ol red fluids streaming down. Let's also not forget the occasional T&A, and the film's heavy pedophilic undertones. Not to mention, if you're not one for psychological challenges, this is a probably an outing you should skip.<br/><br/>""Sin City"" is not perfect. But that's part of the fun. With so much blood, sweat, and tears put in this project, I don't mind a few scruff marks. The plot is invigorating, the direction is slick, and the movie is just balls-to-the-wall fun. Competently directed with high octane thrills, ""Sin City"" is a winner. Rodriguez, make ""Sin City 2"" alright. Go on, I'll wait."
"Guo_Jing","8","0","1","5 April 2010"," Odd, but fun
","I was hesitant about this movie. It had a strong cast and an interesting premise, but something just seemed 'off'. My fears, as it turns out, were not unfounded. The graphics were ridiculous, the premise bizarre, and the whole feel of the movie was strange. However - it was fun. It was fun in a way that most movies could only dream of. Sure, it was ludicrous, but that added to the enjoyability. Most of the film was in black and white, with some color added - such as to a dress or a head. When Elijah Wood's character got dismembered, there was little if any blood. He was just sitting there, with a smile on his face - then you see that his limbs are gone. Quite strange. Mickey Rourke walks around with his face covered in band-aids during the beginning - another ridiculous, but fun, scene in the movie."

","This film is clearly either loved or hated. I for one appreciated it's sheer style, resembling a pumped up comic book noir and the performances are generally quite good. However, almost all the characters are nasty and the film does get exhausting after a while. Benicio Del Toro and Mickey Rourke are the pick of the lot. The film is ultra-violent and definitely not appropriate for children. Its depiction of women is quite frankly old-fashioned, and leaves a nasty taste in the mouth. Still, its a compelling watch thanks to the visual style. Recommended.<br/><br/>Overall 7/10"

","Sin City? Well lets just say this movie had a lot going for it, beautiful cinematography, great effects, and A list of actors, and Quentin Tarantino as a guest director. What happens however is a jumbled mix of noir and an over the top style attitude that Japanese anime seems realistic.<br/><br/>First off the acting; what happened here, it's too over the top they tried to go hard boiled noir but it came out as something different. Not a single character had the subtly of classic noir actors like Robert Mitchum it's just a jumbled mess of wanna be laced dialogue that a fifth grader seems to have written.<br/><br/>Cheesy lines, one dimensional characters who are the perfect cardboard cutouts of clichÃ©d action stars. And the sad thing is the film is so highly praised, proof that our standard audiences aren't watching film for the art, the characters, any of that just action about as over the top as dodging bullets from the Matrix.<br/><br/>Guys with golden eyes, big guns, lots of no, no coherent plot in any of the tales, no development it's just a mess of a film. It's pretty to look at but everything else just goes way over. This isn't a movie that fits into the genre it's homaging or whatever it's just chock full of crap, on top of crap.<br/><br/>Throwing all the bad aside the film is watchable and enjoyable if you shut your brain down for a couple hours, forget that this is supposed to be a noir film and just enjoy it for what it is, a mindless but very pretty action flick."

","Movies aren't supposed to be the same thing (s), and some artists can be slightly or largely crazy. So why did I abominate this somehow different movie, done by 3 crazy artists?!<br/><br/>Robert Rodriguez, Quentin Tarantino and Frank Miller are 3 maniacs. They work loyally in the movies to cure themselves, or to show the poor us their ultimate helpless madness (or to make us that mad!). Anyway, 9 years earlier, (From Dusk till Dawn) was one of Tarantino-Rodriguez's movies which failed at mixing the genre with any probable satire. Therefore, this time, Rodriguez, Tarantino and Miller determined to make it pure violence, pure style!<br/><br/>It's the modern noir, the graphic novels at a new high visual level, however with mere technique, brainless core, shocking violence, nudity, and sickening images that can kill me while watching (the final story with the freak creature for small instance!). So it's a disturbing time, sold as fun movie!<br/><br/>Over and above, the selected stories are very sleazy. Don't try to evaluate any performance, the style invaded all, and with stories like that, forget all about it. It was stupid joke when they put the character of one man who represents the political authority, and how he's evil; it makes me laugh as if this movie has a possible message or something! And I didn't like the CGI; I'm an old-fashioned guy, I hated seeing the CG soldiers in (Star Wars: The Phantom Menace - 1999), while Stanley Kubrick said about 8 thousand extras for (Spartacus - 1960)'s battles: ""This Is Not Enough""!<br/><br/>(Sin City) is considered a victory for the graphic novel movie, and the CGI, but for me, it's eerie obscene monster. While style is a good way to achieve a message, it was too much this time, and even its message of entertainment aimed at nothing but rubbish. You can call it one step for humanity, and for animality too."
"bobsgrock","7","0","1","6 May 2008"," Amazing to look at.
","Really, I have to congratulate Robert Rodriguez on a fantastic job of bringing a graphic novel to the screen exactly as it is on paper. This is not a new idea, but Rodriguez does a masterful job of giving this film the look of the novel, not just the feel. By shooting only on digital film, the entire movie looks like a graphic novel brought to life, which is what it is. The acting is very good, especially by Clive Owen and Bruce Willis, who I think does the finest job as the honest but doomed cop Hartigan. For the most part, this film keeps your attention, but I felt that some of the stories lacked real depth. Of course, we can't blame Rodriguez for that as he is making a direct adaptation. Still, this is film is amazing to look at. Combined with the high-quality star power, the crazy, blood-filled action of the action sequences, and the best scene in the film directed by Quentin Tarantino, all this adds up to a crazy thrill ride that does not let go."

","Right before I watched the film, I thought I have to prepare myself to get in the atmosphere. Yet such a concern has been proved unnecessary within ten seconds since it began. The structure is composed perfectly. Every scene is thought-provoking. The use of colors almost me shout to praise the directer. No moments that are not exciting. Each story is breathtaking. I think it's fair to say Robert has created a kind of art. I really love it. I knew that some failed while watching it. I suggest you should study a little bit about its meaning, influence, and people's comments on it. Recommending it to anyone. Enjoy the feeling that blow you away.

"hitchcockthelegend","9","0","1","6 April 2008"," Visceral, Visionary, Visual, Sin City kicks the big un!
","Three grizzled stories from Basin City comprise the basis for Robert Rodriguez's adaptation of Frank Miller's graphic novels (Miller along for co-directing duties as well). Man mountain Marv is out to avenge a murdered hooker, Dwight attempts to help the red light girls stay independent from the mob, and aging cop Hartigan is trying to protect a beautiful dancer from a sadistic pervert.<br/><br/>I think the first thing I should say is that I have no frame of reference as regards the adaptation here, I have never read (or seen) a Frank Miller story, but from what I can gather from thE IMDb site is that fans of Miller's graphic stories were well pleased with the final result. I'm pleased to see that, because too many times comic book adaptations are roundly panned by the hard core fan base of each respective franchise for not being close to the spirit of the source, so here I'm doubly relieved mainly because I find Sin City to be a majestic assault on the senses.<br/><br/>Sin City is a stark place, full of seedy residents thriving on misery and mistrust, and here we are privy to three stories that only serve to remind us that we don't want to be anywhere near the place. Playing out as some sort of horror comic noir, Sin City is for sure a very violent picture, yet the violence is formed so perfectly in its style, it cloaks the film in artistic class. Once viewed, Sin City is never forgotten, and I for one literally do tip my hat towards Frank Miller & Robert Rodriguez for bringing such a great and interesting movie to the masses. All of the cast do great work, so I'll not single anyone out for praise, the techniques and the whole structure of the piece is quite simply marvellous, and as for the writing? Well get a load of it!<br/><br/>Sin City, a dark horrible place, Sin City, a wonderful wonderful movie. 9/10."

"spypsycho","10","0","1","29 March 2008"," Sin City: Booze, Broads and Bullets at Their Best!
","The best way to shoot as film noir is in black and white, and Sin City's director, Robert Rodriguez, seemed to know that well. Sin City is a wild, ferocious pack of violence, gore, S-M/leather-dressed babes, mutilations and hardcore motherf***ers that kill people either to get revenge for the death of a prostitute or to save a sexy 19-year old table dancer from a multiple child-rapist. Not the average people's idea of a film noir but it's still good. The best of its kind actually, Sin City brings comic book adaptations to movies to a whole new level where it's hard to reach. Because Sin City is not simply inspired by a comic book. It IS the comic book.<br/><br/>Director Robert Rodriquez, alongside with the creator of the comic book series that inspired this movie, takes us to a trip in a decayed city that is ruled by corrupted politicians and cops, through the stories of three men that include a lot of women. First, is a story of revenge. Marv, exceptionally played by a Frankenstein-face-shaped Mickey Rourke, wakes up next to a dead hooker who had given him the time of his life and promises that he will take revenge. Then comes the story of a modern knight, Dwight (Clive Owen), who tries to save the city's prostitutes from the mob and the pimps. The third story is about a decent and actually good police officer by the name of Hartigan (Bruce Willis) who gets set up by the state's corrupted governor (Powers Boothe) whose son is a child-rapist pervert (Nick Stahl). And if this super-star cast is not enough to impress you, add the hottest Jessica Alba you've ever seen, the tight-leather dressed Rosario Dawson, the drunk and crazy Benicio Del Toro, the massive Michael Clark Duncan, the cannibal Elijah Wood and finally the seductive Brittany Murphy.<br/><br/>And it's not only the exceptional acting that makes this movie unique. Rodriquez decided to use as a script and as a storyboard the comic book itself, and that is why he called in its creator to co-direct the movie. The entire movie is created with computer graphics except of course the actors, their props and some small sets. One would imagine an effect similar to the one in ""Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow"" where the result looked rather fake-ish and idiotic. What Rodriquez managed to accomplish is a city with the dark and sinister feeling that Frank Miller's city ought to have. Inside their black and white environment, one can notice certain colorful objects such as a babe's lipstick, another one's blonde hair, one's blue, green or golden eyes, red shoes and red blood. And there is a lot of it. Shown either dark red or fluorescent white, blood is something this movie is not missing at. And that is because Rodriguez and Miller did not use some cheap tricks and cuts to get their movie a PG-13 rating like many Hollywood directors use to do. They went all the way. They even hired Rodriguez's pal, Quentin Tarantino, as a ""special guest director"" for one dollar, to do a scene where Dwight talks with a corpse inside a car full of dead bodies.<br/><br/>Those of you who feel disgusted by the description so far, don't go watch the movie, it gets much worse. You might be used to Rodriguez as a family director for his last lame movie series, ""Spy Kids"", but in Sin City Rodriguez shows his true self making a movie alike legendary ""Pulp Fiction"" but in black and white. Forget the innocent little Frodo and get ready to face a bloodthirsty cannibal. In fact, forget everything you knew about movies until know. Sin City is an uncompromising vision that does not care about critics and acclaims. Miller's dark and sinister imagination does not get changed in any way besides that it gains movement and life. It's the first time we see a comic book so perfectly and so purely transferred to the big screen unlike the recent rapisms of classic comic books like Spiderman and the Fantastic Four. One must be warned: most people are not going to like Sin City. And I can't blame them of course. It's brutal, raw, violent and sick. But that is what makes it what it is. Not ""Robert Rodriguez's Sin City"" or ""Quentin Tarantino's Sin City"", but a pure, authentic ""Frank Miller's Sin City""."

","I personally loved this movie, but the guy I went to she it with did not enjoy it. I loved the use of black and white just as it was used in the novel. The use of color really emphasizes the emotion and drama tied it with the given event or item. I thought that the choice of actors and actresses really played well to Miller's characters. The only reason the guy I went to see it was didn't like is was because he felt that the stories jumped around to much and I times could be confusing. This is one of those movies that you either love it or hate it, there really isn't any in between. This is also the kind of movie that you just have to sit down and watch. My mother tried to watch while she was cooking dinner and hated it. The next weekend we sat down together and watched it and she really enjoyed it. I think that much of this movies strengths are in the visual attributes and the great work done by the films producers to really capture the feel of the Frank Miller original. I am really looking forward to the release of the next film and hopefully more to come."

"Sternicus","8","0","1","22 February 2008"," Graphic Novel Graphic Violence
","This is the most violent movie I have ever seen. (That does not mean that there's not more excessive films it just means that this is the most violent film that I've had the chance to see so far) It is essentially a graphic novel brought to life to show death. In the behind the scenes featurete guest director Quentin Taratino marvels at the likeness between Micky Rouke and the character from novel he portrays. The sociopath with a heart (for the women only) Marve. <br/><br/>He states; ""It's almost as if Frank Miller gave birth to him.(yuck!)He drew Marve then he created an actor who could play Marve.""<br/><br/>Well Frank Miller must have gotten an abortion because Marve gets fried... painfully in the electric chair at the end of his story. Not once but twice because he was too strong to die fast. His sarcastic last words reply after the first failed attempt are,""Is that the best you can do you patsies?"" After which he is fried again this time killing him while blood trickles out his mouth. To me to show that death scene in a way so blatant shows a lack of consideration for the character and what he went through to avenge the death of his one night stand/love even if his methods were a little extreme in their own (prolonged torture).<br/><br/>Like the others have said; despite the abuse women receive in this movie the men have it worse. The only break a male hero character can receive is death. With the exception of Dwight McCarthy played by Clive Owen. I was curious to see it but was a little hesitant cause I knew it was going to be excessive but I didn't know it was going to be this excessive.At first it was your typical Robert Rodriguiez flick (a wannabe Pulp Fiction, scenes with dudes flying through the air after being shot with pistols, overcompensating action) then things got a little more morbid. It started as it began into the second story, the one with Marve. This second story actually cuts into the middle of the first one which was then finished latter on... just another example of Robert Rodriguiez's obsession with Pulp Fiction and his motivation to imitate it, in this case it was Pulp Fiction's disjointed chronology also NOTE: over the course of his career Robert Rodriguiez has appeared to have imitated some of Pulp Fiction's music (Desperado), violence scenes (Desperado, Once Opoun a Time in Mexico) and at least attempted by his own admission the gimmicky dialog (Once Opoun a Time in Mexico, see the commentary). One reason for this I believe is that he is a somewhat insecure film maker who dreams of greatness which is why he hangs out with Quentin Taratino who is seen by some as a ""sacred cow"" among the Hollywood elite. Anyway's back to the Marve story. On the graphic novel it is known as known as The Hard GoodBye. There's a scene where Marve was captured and imprisoned in the basement of a serial killer's house with his female probation officer who is naked (oh boy!)and who's hand had been chopped off and eaten by the psycho played by Elijah Wood. (oh yeah... wait what the F***!)Her traumatized scream; ""He made me watch!!!"" made me feel so ill. I was shaken to the core and the film still wouldn't let up a for a minute. Sin City must have been a movie goer's nightmare; being in a dark room with a big screen projector showing castrations, dismemberment's, and Frodo ,er sorry... Elijah Wood getting eaten by a dog. Strangely when I was watching it the DVD jammed and I was spared a break so I could recuperate until I decided to finish it. Yes that's right I finished it... and then I watched it AGAIN! Why you ask? Because I liked it. The violence was entertaining and I desensitized myself to it. If Sin City deserves credit for anything good it's the voice over's which I believe added so much depth to the characters. And it showed how ridiculous it would look if real life was as cartoonish as a comic books. Some scenes were so wacky and ridiculous they provide the film with almost no credibility. It is possible though that the scene where Kevin shows no pain on his face after being cut up, and fed to his own dog was a product of Marve's hallucinations which he admits he takes medication for. It could have been that Kevin was already killed by Marve's powerful punch to the head and the whole time he was dismembering a corpse, and imagining that it was staring back at him. But the scene's not explained that way it's just a cool theory. Personally I think Robert Rodriguiez looked at this film more of as a cool little project to do instead of as a film he could be proud of, or cherish that he made it."

","I always wanted to see this film when it first came out, because I love comic book adaptations, except for a few. Anyway, Frank Miller's ""Sin City"" was a very different and dark film. The film revolves around three characters and has three different stories. All the stories are good but I like Marv's and Hartigan's stories the best. This film has a very unique look for it, I love that only a few objects in the film had color. It was very artistic, I know some people think the movie is overrated, but I think it is a very interesting style and great storytelling by Frank Miller, Robert Rodriguez, and Quentin Tarantino. I do hope that the sequels are successful, good luck Mr. Rodriguez I hope you do a great job on the next two films."

","I heard a lot of shite put on this movie but i instantly dismissed all claims once i'd seen it as a pathetic waste of breath. This is great. The B/W mixed with color gave me Schindlers List flashbacks and i thought it was great. All the performances were actually really good. Bruce, Clive, Mickey even Jessica (Oh My God She's So So Hot But Cant Act For Her Life) Alba managed a decent performance. The only thing that upset me was when Bruce killed himself. Come On! The Big BW should never die. But oh well, it doesn't matter that much. Overall, this deserves a big 8/10 or **** stars and is worth a watch if your a noir fan. Enjoy!"
"jmbwithcats","8","0","2","28 January 2008"," Sin City Stays True Again and Again
","Sin city had a message, hell it had many.<br/><br/>Sin City was a film carefully plotted from the genius of Frank Miller. I won't say the writing is as great as Allan Moore, but it stands it's ground. I really hoped Quentin Tarantino would throw in Chiaki Kuriyama (Kill Bill, Battle Royale) as Miho. Overall the movie had timing, some flaws, okay it had flaws, but it was probably the most true to the roots comic book based film ever made.<br/><br/>V for Vendetta coming out, it's going to have a tough time outdoing Sin City, but if anyone can stand their own it's the works of Allan Moore.<br/><br/>Here's a few far more disturbing films:<br/><br/>Ichi the Killer Tetsuo Battle Royale Flowers of Flesh and Blood Cannibal Ferox<br/><br/>You get the point, there's thousands of more disturbing films.<br/><br/>Sin City was a reminder of heroism and a warning to the threat our world is under by violence, drugs, war, prostitution, the strategic compromise of values. <br/><br/>I got a very National Socialist propaganda ideology from the film... the swastika shurikan, and the idealistic nature of socialism in the hero role, the courage of man, and the superman in the future world of a brittle and decaying modern society that just doesn't work. I find the core elements of National Socialism intriguing, but can never figure out why evil men take up the doctrine, then twist it into the prejudice, murdering reality that is our history.<br/><br/>Sin City was a reminder of where we've been, and a warning of where we're headed if we don't work out the hate before it's too late.<br/><br/>Sin City in its original serialized comic form was everything that one would expect from the then well known artist/writer/creator Frank Miller and more. Many would come to say that it is his best work. <br/><br/>For years it was a world that only existed on paper in black and white with splashes of color, but it was enough to make Sin City live and breath in ways that few others in the medium have ever been able to come close to. Because Miller's dark, noir overtones painted a very clear, and fully realized picture of every seedy back alley and strip club, and cheap motel room in the fictional Basin City it became painfully obvious that it was just too visceral a place to ever be real in a way that could be encapsulated on film, or at least we, including Miller himself, thought. We were wrong.<br/><br/>This is THE comic movie we have been waiting for and it does not disappoint from the first overly dramatic voice-over to the last frame of the credit scroll. Telling three tales from Miller's world (The Hard Goodbye, The Big Fat Kill, and That Yellow Bastard) the comic transitions from paper to cellulose flawlessly and believably with a grace seldom seen. This ease is especially incredible for something so over the top and stylized like this that it's almost hard to imagine that these are the actors you've grown to know and love for years. But they are and it all comes together beautifully.<br/><br/>The cast, crew, and artists involved in making this adaptation a reality should be commended for their service to the idea that a true comic book movie can, in fact, be made without making concessions to the masses, without altering the plot or changing the characters, and still manage to retain the feel that the ink on paper had while creating a truly entertaining film. Much of this film's success can be directly contributed to the fantastic casting job which encompasses an incredibly long list of a-list and up and coming celebs plus a few obscure but cult favorites (yes, I'm talking to you Rutger) and the tag team direction of Frank Miller and Robert Rodriguez. Rodriguez should be particularly touted for pushing Miller to finally do this project, and for leading the way to make this the film that Miller always wanted it to be and that Rodriguez knew he could make.<br/><br/>While I do have a few nit-picky points of contention with cut dialog or certain actors/actresses that refused to bare it all for the sake of keeping intact every last detail from the books it doesn't change the fact that what was laid out on the polyester film stock before me was every bit as entertaining as the original works, and it made a pretty darn good flick to boot. If it's not already self-evident, the bar has been raised for the comic movie. The next brave soul willing to venture in had better be prepared to take on Sin City."
"98nurdinm-1","8","0","2","9 January 2008"," ""Sin City""
","I had heard the hype, the glories thrown at the feet of this film, read the snide comments thrown at subsequent films which apparently were trying to be like ""Sin City"". So, when the time came, I knew I had to watch this film.<br/><br/>I am SO glad I did. This film blew me away from pretty much the first minute. The wonderful use of monochrome with the little splashes of colour truly make this a fantastical, yet realistic world. The big name stars are all impressive, particularly Bruce Willis and Mickey Rourke. The violence is a weird but brilliant mixture of realism and cartoonish - we never see the full extent to a lot of the gory scenes, at least we didn't in the cut I watched. But a splash of blood - and there's a lot of it in this film - is all we need to see to know that, whatever's happening off screen, it ain't pretty.<br/><br/>I think the true success of the film has to be Frank Miller's co-direction. This is, after all, his baby, and it's such an inspired though obvious idea to have him direct the feature film of his graphic novel. With him at the helm you can be sure that no fan boys will be disappointed. Although I haven't read the books myself, I want to now, that's for sure, and that's part of ""Sin City""'s magic.<br/><br/>I do have one or two little nit picking problems - Jessica Alba, though gorgeous, doesn't really have much to do here apart from snog Bruce Willis and be generally mistreated by most of the other blokes. And Clive Owen is great, but is the character supposed to be English, or could he not be bothered to join the rest of the male cast in their deep, gravelly American voices? That's another little problem I had - nearly all the main blokes sounded the same. Were they supposed to? <br/><br/>On the whole though, a great film! Can't wait for the proposed sequel - this one I'll HAVE to see at the cinema!<br/><br/>8/10"
"cjfort","8","0","2","8 January 2008"," The Review: Sin City
","Sin City is based on the Graphic novel by Frank Miller and directed masterfully by Robert Rodriguez. The film twists different story lines together all in this horribly sin infested city where everything is full of the nastiest things imaginable.<br/><br/>The film is, as I said, masterfully directed, but everything else doesn't live up to those standards. The film suffers from violence that goes extremely violent when it doesn't need to to make it's point, and the same goes for the sexual themes. The ""Sin"" in ""Sin City"" is just a tad bit over the top (that being said, it's over the top for an over the top movie). Also the dialog is reminiscent of old crime movies (kinda corny), but it works well for the movie...most of the time. Sometimes it feels right, sometimes it's very awkward.<br/><br/>The acting and just about everything else is good (though, the stories sometimes get too dark). Overall, it's it's over the top style mixed with either OVER over the top material or unfitting dialog that seems to pull this movie down from the ranks of being really great, but is still a good film.<br/><br/>Rating: *** (of 4) <br/><br/>Entertainment: **** (of 5)"
"davidallenxyz","8","0","2","7 January 2008"," One of the few films to truly create a new language in cinema
","Devastatingly stylish yet extremely violent and with a fetishised view of female sexuality this is a spectacular film.<br/><br/>The monochrome comic-book visuals drive the story along with rare and intense splashes of colour to complement the gritty dialogue and performances.<br/><br/>Effectively the film is three vignettes, stories from the soaked streets of Basin City, in a reality that could be today.<br/><br/>The strongest performance is by Mickey Rourke as the tough Marv, punching his way through every scene. Bruce Willis plays cop Hartigan with conviction, but Clive Owen is less convincing as Dwight. This is not a film for a twisted Englishman, American muscle is what it takes. However Dwight's story is perhaps the most authentic, the others wandering a little too far into fantasy violence.<br/><br/>The female cast manage to bring depth to what are superficially roles based on arousing lust and caution, in particular Brittany Murphy as waitress Shellie. Although the film kneels at the altar of female power, it isn't about female empowerment. Sin City remains fundamentally a man's world.<br/><br/>Recommended if you have the stomach for what is without a doubt a standout piece of extreme cinema."

","I liked it a lot, the characters were one dimensional and some of the acting wasn't that great, but that wasn't really the movies main objective. The cinematorgraphy and action were great, and the plots aimed at ""cool"", and that's really what it stood on, but did so in a way where I wouldn't mind watching it again and again. The continuous voice overs got a bit annoying at first, but after awhile I slowly warmed the Raymond Chandler voice overs. This film, if nothing else is a great link between the poetry of static visual comics art and film, as well as an homage to all the gritty pulp stories that carried 20th century pop literature like placenta, detective stories, crime stories, film noir, etc. Yes, Frank Miller leans into misogyny and racism like a pirate leans on a peg leg(see 300), but that does not prevent this film from bieng one of the most original and entertaining action films in recent memory. One of the best in this new decade easily.<br/><br/>(Being a fan of the books, however, these films really do fail to tell the whole story, the comics are actually much more human and three dimensional, really. Interested parties take note.)"

","OK you may call me an idiot or at least non-intellectual for not liking this movie, but I'm sorry, that's how I feel. And since everyone else loved it, I guess it's me who doesn't understand from good movies.<br/><br/>First of all it's not a full length movie, it's three non-related stories that were forced to be related to each other so that three of them could make one movie. As I said before, it's just me, who just can't enjoy watching ""amores perros"" type of movie where the writer writes three-four short stories and tries to relate them to make a movie out of them.<br/><br/>Secondly, I know it's me again, but I got extremely bored and was surprised how such a violent movie can be boring. There's not much to say about a movie if u keep looking at the time while watching. I really believe this movie was famous and liked just because of its famous director Robert Rodriguez. Like for example, ""Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow"" was a hundred times better, giving that dark ""comic book"" atmosphere on every scene.<br/><br/>And I don't wanna talk about the non-needed weirdness of the movie, like the devil looking guy who we don't have any idea why he looks like that. I don't wanna talk about it cause it probably has an explanation only the comic-fans know. But what the hell, even the ""Fantastic Four"" movie had come up with explanations with the heroes' ridiculous super powers."
"DarthBill","7","0","1","13 November 2007"," While admittedly not my personal preference, this is definitely a knock out
","Visually stunning film adaptation of comic book scribe Frank Miller's ""Sin City"" stories (which he actually co-directed at the insistence of Robert Rodriguez). Rather than focus on one character's storyline, the film chronicles the antics, shenanigans and misadventures of a handful of different characters, all of them noirish anti-heroes or anti-heroines who are as jaded and decidedly anti-social as they come. Among the story lines, Bruce Willis's aging cop suffers for trying to save an innocent little girl from a senator's child molesting son (Nick Stahl, who becomes the Yellow Bastard), that little girl grows up to be a stripper played by Jessica Alba who's in love with Willis's long suffering cop even though he's old enough to be her grandpa (in real life more like old enough to be her father but that's beside the point), Clive Owen's mystery man Dwight gets in trouble for helping hookers kill a cop (Del Toro) who was roughing up on his girlfriend (Brittany Murphy) which breaks an alliance code between cops and hookers, Mickey Rourke seeks revenge on the stoic yet effeminate cannibal who helped kill his would be girlfriend, and Josh Hartnett plays a potentially misogynistic kill.<br/><br/>Shot in staggeringly beautiful black & white mimicking the comic book panels to an almost painfully accurate point and being just all around almost blatantly macho in its carefree more-the-merrier attitude, this film should please both Frank Miller fans and general action fans (though Alexis Bledel of ""Gilmore Girls"" is hopelessly miscast as one of the hookers)."

","I've so much heard about this movie and the worship around it that I was quite impatient for seeing it, finally... I've found it disappointing !<br/><br/>Why ?

I was even more disappointed cos' I had seen in a paper the screen shots made by Rodriguez to persuade Miller for making this movie. It was way better and faithful to the comics than the actual movie is.<br/><br/>Eastwood has succeeded in a lot of scenes of ""Million dollar baby"" to make what Sin City should have been visually... and this without used a computer or a digital camera. Another example : just compare the ""balcony's scenes"" of both Minority Report and Sin city. Nuff said ? That's the difference between 2 genius directors and a lazy one.<br/><br/>Fortunately, the story is the same so I can't have been disappointed by that : Miller is a great ""novellist"".

His creepy presence was really unnerving, even though his dialogue was non-existent.<br/><br/>My only regret about this film is the casting of Clive Owen in one of the key roles. I have nothing against this actor who has done some great work , most recently in 'Children of Men', but he somehow seems misplaced in Sin City. His English accent doesn't fit in with the way the other characters speak, and he appears too clean-cut to be associating with the assorted lowlifes who inhabit the film.<br/><br/>In short I would recommend this film to all fans of stylish action films, and I defy anyone not to be glued to the screen whenever Rourke's 'Marv' puts in an appearance."

And in my opinion, the cast assembled for this movie is one of the best of all time. When you have guys like Michael Clarke Duncan and Josh Hartnett taking minor roles, you're doing pretty well for yourself. But apart from the amazing cast, the thing that got me was the presentation.

There is completely unimaginable levels of gore in this film I generally feel some of the things you will see in this film are some of the worst things I have seen in a film, but I never really felt horrified because the gore was largely cartoonist, with white blood and you never feel a single shred of sympathy for the characters undergoing these gruesome ordeals.<br/><br/>The film often uses first and sometimes even third person narrative in a Dick Tracy style detective fashion and this is extremely lovable. <br/><br/>I would easily say this is my second favourite film ever but then I to my shame have yet to see a lot of great films so forgive me for rating it so highly, I am not a gore seeking idiot either I generally just merit this film in its originality that never allows you to switch off."

A thing that intrigued me more was the fact that Rodriguez and Tarantino were working together on it (although Tarantino only directed small part of film) , of course they make a good pair making ""From Dusk Till Dawn"" and ""Desperado"".<br/><br/>As for the film itself, I was surprised to see another pulp fiction style structured film in the context of, there being 3 stories that initially intertwine as the film progresses. Although it had the same rough and sleazy feel to the film it failed to deliver something that pulp fiction did, the breaking of gangster stereotypes. Pulp Fiction did this through casual every day conversation and pop culture reference. This is also used effectively in Reservoir Dogs. This fact somehow brings the film down to average status.<br/><br/>The three stories have somewhat simple but effective plots that makes it easy to follow. Unlike pulp fiction, it didn't have on screen chapter names, some people believe that to be an advantage however, i believe the use of chapter titles makes it easier to take in but the use of a black screen for a few seconds isn't all that bad.<br/><br/>The stories don't intertwine as cleverly as the 3 in pulp fiction do and this i think affects the message and style of the film. The outrageous and graphic violence in this movie are quite overdone and seems as if they were put in to just be controversial and shock the audience rather then show real life, possible situations. I am talking about the movie without thinking about the comic so I'm not suggesting that the director should have lowered it down, i am just looking at this as a movie rather then an adaptation of a comic book.<br/><br/>In conclusion, i see this as an entertaining film but movie fanatics, don't prepare to be impressed by the lacklustre stories 5/10"

When a movie is listed in the top 75 that means it is excellent, end of story. The public has spoken and you crybabies who act as the thought police for the rest of us wouldn't know art if you walked into Escher's warehouse. For you folks who have trouble with suspension of disbelief with this movie you simply don't get it. You're not suppose to view it as a true story. You're supposed to breath it in as entertainment. I'm tired of people who expect flights of fancy to look and sound like something from PBS. If your imagination can't connect the dots when watching a movie like this, do the rest of us a favor and stop viewing movies altogether so we won't have to wade thru your misinformed political diatribes masquerading as a movie review."

","Superficial review for a deep movie. I was totally impressed with everything that has to do with this movie (visuals, sound, acting, dialogs, and of course, feeling). But I will comment on the basics and most obvious features of it because I felt that it's an easy way to understand how perfect this movie is in all the sense of the word.<br/><br/>Spectacular Action flick that transports us to a new, fresh style of film-making. Robert Rodriguez shows us that we haven't seen anything yet talking about new cinematography and action sequences. <br/><br/>""Sin City"" is based on a comic book and that's why you can see a radical change of custom cinematography. It works and fits perfect for the movie's tone and events. There are three different stories with the common denominator of violence, glorious fresh gore, and badass characters. The stories deal with romance, sense of justice, forgiveness, and of course, the best, revenge.<br/><br/>The dialogs of the movie are filled with exciting badass lines. You can't get a better film with violent, truly comic book style characters than this! ""Sin City"" rocks. As simply as that.<br/><br/>Heck , it has for every taste. We males, get sexy, very hot women like Jessica Alba, Brittany Murphy (she never looked this sexy!), Alexis Bledel (amazing looks, totally sexy), Roselyn Sànchez, Carla Gugino, Jaime King, plus many sexy prostitutes. This movie has everything, specially for a male audience who wants heroes! <br/><br/>This new way of film making will stay for a long time. Thanks Mr. Rodriguez for doing a brave, innovative, sexy, piece of cinema. His direction is simply from another unexplored world. <br/><br/>I dug all the stories, characters, visuals, and specially fast pace. This is the kind of Action movie that you wish it lasted longer. ""Sin City"" will keep you asking for more."
"jexline","10","0","2","1 May 2007"," A masterpiece
","""Frank Miller's Sin City"", co-directed by Robert Rodriguez and Miller himself is one of my all-time favorite movies for the reason that it contains everything anybody could be looking for in a movie: Action, romance, film noir, great fight scenes, and incredible, intriguing story all the way through. Adapted from the novels ""The Hard Goodbye"", ""The Big Fat Kill"", and ""That Yellow Bastard"" and the yarn ""The Customer is Always Right"", ""Sin City"" takes a ""Pulp Fiction"" approach in having three stories that are all connected in one through characters and location. The first (and last) story of the film, ""That Yellow Bastard"" has Bruce Willis as a righteous cop trying to avenge the pedophiliac son (Nick Stahl) of a senator (Powers Boothe). The second story ""The Hard Goodbye"" casts Mickey Rourke as a ""psycho killer"" out to seek revenge on his ""one true love"" Goldie (Jaime King), while the third story (which is actually more like the middle story) has Clive Owen as a do-gooder trying to save the night from a raving lunatic (Benicio Del Toro). All stories are bookended by ""The Customer is Always Right"" with a figurative salesman (Josh Harnett) hired first to kill a mysterious woman (Marley Shelton) and then a major character from one of the other stories. One of the most striking things about this film (or shall I say video, since it was shot in HD)is the black and white look (especially considering how it was shot)that captures Frank Miller's comics with color thrown in for effect (red blood, the Yellow Bastard, Goldie, etc). The performances are all outstanding (maybe with the exception of Brittany Murphy, although it's hard to say bad dialogue good), especially Rourke, Owen, and Rosario Dawson as a dominatrix-hooker who moonlights as Owen's lover. I love Frank Miller's ""Sin City"" novels with a passion (they're practically the only comics I will read) and this is a great adaptations. All of the characters look and sound as I have imagined them and the entire feeling of the comics are preserved here on celluloid. Can't wait for the sequels!<br/><br/>10/10"

","I love it when you watch a film, and end up thinking ""wow I didn't see that coming! That was good!"", It happened to me with Sin City, a lot was being talked about this movie, but I always stick to my criticism about large amount of hype, and that criticism is simple, It doesn't work! Sure, people started talking about how good it was and stuff, but I didn't had ears for that kind of chat, I kept on living until a certain point that a friend of mine said she had bought this movie, and asked me if I wanted to see it, of course I said yes, and I'm glad I said yes! What a joy! At first I though it was one strange film, all uncolored, highly violent, weird stories about helping people you barely know, killing, killingand then it hit me, this is Sin City, it ain't the City of Beauty, it is chaotic, trashy and nasty, it is the city of corruption and violence, and I love it!! Three stories connected to each other, but each one of them with its own focuses, and they pretty much look like what they should, a comic book transformed into a film, the dialogs are sharp and tight, some very poetical, referencing persons as goddess and such things.<br/><br/>The choice of the actors to play the roles were very good, I can't firmly cite better actors for the characters, since all of them did such a great jog, the one actor that happened to be not-so-good on the screen was Jessica Alba, she was OK, but surrounded by actor that surpassed all my expectations about the film, I found her doing the least enjoyable job, but even so, a very decent acting. The highlights goes to Bruce Willis, Benicio Del Toro, Mickey Rourke and Clive Owen. I didn't have doubts about Clive Owen doing or not a good job, he was born for this kind of character, dark and mysterious. Mickey Rourke was the best in my opinion, everything about his acting was outstanding, voice, acting, lines, characterization.<br/><br/>I strongly recommend this movie, it's a piece of pure dark art, full of action, suspense and memorable lines, you maybe have got to open you mind for some brutal scenes, even though they're all like a very realistic cartoon, because that's what this film is all about, sins and violence, but yet not losing its comic side. Yes the movie doesn't have any color, except for some key objects like a bed, some blood, the ""monster guy"" and such, but that just adds to the atmosphere, excellent film!"

","This is how comic book/graphic novel adaptations should be done. Frank Miller's post-modern noir Sin City is a brilliant artwork. Dark, gritty, dirty, sexy, sleazy and violent. Adaptations have ranged from great (Spiderman) to the truly abysmal (Hulk). Sin City lies in the perfect range, Robert Rodriguez, Frank Miller and Special Guest Director Quentin Tarantino captured the novel and brought it beautifully to screen with an extremely talented cast of veterans and young ones.<br/><br/>Writer Frank Miller weaves a Pulp Fiction style narrative throughout the twisted streets, alleys, bars and people of Sin City flawlessly. All the actors embellish their roles. Bruce Willis, Clive Owen, Mickey Rourke (especially), Elijah Woods, Nick Stahl and Benicio Del Toro are all fantastic. Likewise, the women are amazing. Jessica Alba, Rosario Dawson, Brittany Murphy, Devon Aoki, Jaime King and Alexis Bledel are perfect in their roles.<br/><br/>The look of Sin City is stunning and gorgeous. It is primarily black and white with splashes of bright red and yellow. The violence is very visceral and stylized with plenty of decapitations, stabbings, slicing and shooting occurring throughout, shot very nicely as well.<br/><br/>In short, Sin City is brilliant in all aspects and the sequel is very highly anticipated in this viewer's books.<br/><br/>5/5"

","A look into a few intersecting stories of people in the dark, dreary and dank underbelly of the notorious fictional metropolis of Sin City.<br/><br/>The film is nothing short of a visual masterpiece and practically redefines noir cinematography. The smoke filled, tense, and dangerous atmosphere of the city is present in virtually every frame. All with the comic book spin to each image. The film looks both frighteningly real yet impressively imaginative throughout. Even die hard fans of the ultra-violent novel have praised it for its faithfulness to its source. Many adaptations, even if good, don't come nearly as close to being so visually and thematically similar at the same time to their sources.<br/><br/>That said the film is definitely not for all tastes. The dark and uncompromisingly violent tone throughout seems to go even beyond extreme by the end and to the absurd. Beatings, shootings, dismemberment, impalement, spraying blood and pure nausea really test the viewers gut. It's the point and what else can you expect from a town full of criminals and corrupted people, but most will get that point well before the movie is even half over.<br/><br/>Overall it's a good film noir and the amount of violent excess present is ultimately up to the viewer, but no matter who is watching it's there. --- 7/10<br/><br/>Rated R for strong violence and brutality"
"mnpollio","1","0","2","16 February 2007"," Visually striking trash
","The look of this critically acclaimed film is striking: A neo-noir comic book that springs to life on the screen and is so richly textured that it takes your breath away. Unfortunately, 30 minutes later the novelty of the cinematography wears off and there is nothing to replace it. Based on a Frank Miller graphic novel that I have not read (and would not read having endured this travesty), the film is little more than a series of ultra-violent vignettes set in the dark, dank crime-riddled streets of the big city. There is nary a violent or sexual act that the film does not lovingly glorify to the point of it becoming a fetish. As depicted, every man is violent and corrupt and every woman is a whore. Despite an unending spate of recognizable faces, there is literally no likable character with which to engage viewer sympathy. None of the vignettes are surprising or clever trudging tediously from point A to B without any evidence of wit or class. There is virtually no suspense involved at any point in the film making this one of the most desensitizing and soporific films to come along in quite some time. By the time an army of barely-clad weapons-laden prostitutes take the screen amid the rivers of dark-hued blood spilled so liberally throughout the film, one recognizes that the film has devolved into little more than a sexually stunted, ADD-riddled cyber-geek's Mountain Dew-induced fever dream."

","This is a film for anyone who loves great cinema or great stories. Stylized to the point that many of the scenes look, intentionally, just like comic book panels, it makes extraordinary use of a broad range of lighting and cinematography techniques. Of all the comics/graphic novels to screen adaptations, this movie succeeds in a way that sets the bar very high for everyone else. The only other comic book adaptation that comes close is Hellboy.<br/><br/>The acting, every bit of it, is spot-on. Jessica Alba, Jaime King, Rosario Dawson, and Carla Gugino all successfully portray mythic archetypes that are recognizable from a thousand stories and across a variety of genres.<br/><br/>Someone rather clueless said that this isn't a movie for feminists. (Yet another sad example of the triumph of propaganda over reality, for those lacking the wit to know one from the other, anyway.) I am a feminist, and what I loved about this movie was the way it portrayed women as strong and in control, especially in situations where they are usually depicted as helpless victims. The women in this movie use their heads. They motivate everything that happens.<br/><br/>The men are mostly mindless beasts or automatons, slaves to their twisted desires. The antagonists are motivated by perverse hungers, lust, and greed, which lead them to do evil things. The protagonists are motivated by a mixture of possessive paternalism and vengeance, which lead them to do horrible things, albeit to noble ends. These masochistic ""heros"" are also endlessly self-sacrificing, sometimes to a point that seems suicidal.<br/><br/>Sin City is a film about vengeance writ large, in bold, primary colors; it is a film about heroic action and senseless violence, and it is, without question, a feminist manifesto."
"charchuk","5","0","1","29 January 2007"," Visually stunning
","Extraordinarily stylish, probably one of the most visual films of all time. The cinematography, editing, and special FX are all top-notch. It's a shame the stories didn't quite live up to them. Taken on their own, each is fairly interesting, but there's no flow between them. There's slight cross-over, but not nearly enough. Because of this, the film sags in the middle of each tale, as each one drags on for a bit too long.<br/><br/>The acting is all over the place. Each of the three leads (Mickey Rourke, Clive Owen, Bruce Willis) give great performances, and their internal monologues sound natural. But none of the supporting players can match these three, as they range from over-the-top (Stahl) to wooden (Madsen, Alba) to downright lifeless (Murphy, Dawson). None of them seem able to convey the stylized dialogue naturally. Still, the performances of the three leads more than make up for them.<br/><br/>The real highlight here, of course, is the visuals. It's not just the black and white with flashes of colour, or the computer-generated backgrounds, or the occasional white silhouettes, its the combination of all of this to make a realized, live-action comic book. Every shot is stunning, and the fluid camera only adds to the beauty. Simply amazing.<br/><br/>All in all, an amazing film to watch, if only for the visual treat, that doesn't hold up nearly as well, because of the sub-par stories and acting. Still, an incredible accomplishment."
"pedro-jedi","9","0","1","25 January 2007"," A fun noir-film with ultraviolence.
","Many friends of mine just thought that they were watching some meaningless movie with some psychotic characters so they stopped watching it in the first (and gorier) story. But this movie isn't just about ultraviolence, thugs and whores with submachine guns (what could attract many guys to watch Sin City), it's about principles and three very well written stories, every protagonist have an ideal and try to achieve it, even if achieving it may cost their lives; It's not difficult to find out because with the noir traces (narrative for example) you can easily understand what's on their minds and how they feel.<br/><br/>The acting is above average as a result of a terrific cast for the roles, Mickey Rourke (as Marv) has a wonderful acting here, he fitted perfectly the character and made Marv the most empathetic and original character from Sin City. I had the opportunity to read the comics and it's clearly that this is the most authentic comic adaptation ever. This genuine mark is due Frank Miller's wish.<br/><br/>Sin City is for people that support (or even enjoy) some violence and gore but does not interfere in the overall sense, a very well done and entertaining movie!"
"ag-jones","9","0","1","23 December 2006"," 'Sin city' is a very good comic adaptation
","When i saw this movie on cable i only saw about half of it excluding Marv's story. Even though Marv's story is meant to be the best,the rest of the movie is still very good. A tough gritty noir in short is what you could call this movie. It's all that and more. The main characters which are (Dwight,Marv and Hartigan) are what you would call male fantasies but 'sin city' has great character development through the 3 main characters. Not so much with everybody else but they all seem less important since these are Dwight,Marv and Hartigan's stories.<br/><br/>If you like Tarantino films you will find that this has some of his work in it, due to the fact he was a guest director for a scene or two. All in all this film isn't for the young ones since it can be unnecessarily gory and violent in some parts. But 'sin city' just wouldn't be the same without these qualities."

","Run for your life in this labyrinth of sin and madness, only to realize that there's no way out. This is a savage jungle where humans have turned ravenous beasts, feeding on the flesh and blood of their fellow creatures, and even in death you die a violent and merciless one. Yes, welcome to HELL. In it cops are corrupted, politicians crooked, God and religion dead. You live a nightmarish zombie existence and there is no redemption. Killing is survival.<br/><br/>I know this will not be my favorite film but still it completely blew my mind. Co-directing the film himself, Frank Miller has brought his own graphic novel onto screen alive and with style. There's really nothing quite like it before, the closest I can think of is Natural Born Killers. But NBK is outrageous, flashy, and ostentatious while Sin City is dark, broody, and lyrical, with a touch of 'noir' feel, though both are extremely violent, absurd, and crazy. The plot consists of three stories intertwined and runs coherently. I don't care much about the plot though; the style is all i live for. Style is in itself true art, and this film nailed it, it's beautifully done.<br/><br/>I hadn't read any synopsis or reviews of this film before watching it- I love to watch films this way cos it always gives me delightful surprises. Not aware of the cast except Bruce Willis and Jessica Alba, I was amazed by several minor but impressive performances- Elijah Wood as the nerdy-looking but chilling cannibal (can you imagine that? THink about him in Lord of the Rings!) and Devon Aoki (Yes! the half American half Japanese Chanel top model!) as the lovely mute angel-whore-swords-woman, Miho. Initially i thought that Quentin Tarantino must have been responsible for Miho's sword fight scenes, cos the scenes immediately reminded me of his Kill Bill, but later someone else corrected me that QT directed instead the car conversation scene.<br/><br/>Watching this film in the theater is awesome. Words can't really convey the sensation, you have to go watch it yourself.<br/><br/>This film is not for everyone- if you don't like QT-styled/influenced films or you can't take exaggerated, gruesome violence (body parts chopped off and flying away or beaten to a pulp) or you can't maintain a playful, detached mindset, then this film is NOT for you."

","Watching the legend of a comic book come alive right in front of my eyes was something that I wasn't truly ready for.

The signs that should have been obvious to me are now blurred into a world where the dames deserve better than this two bit hooker life and I should have known better. Without my medicine, it's too hard to know what's real anymore. Do the people that I'm killing on the way to the truth really deserve it? Or have I become what they said I would, A homicidal murderer...<br/><br/>So goes the over the top, comic book inner-dialog of each of our three heroes. The these long black and white vignettes are secondary to the eye candy of of the shady side of town world amazingly re-created by directors Frank Miller and Robert Rodriguez. The story is about the town itself, Basin City where hope was replaced long ago by survival. There is little color in this town and in this film, so when color takes over scenes, as in the opening of red lips and green eyes, you know it's to be savored.<br/><br/>Oh yeah... a dark film with dark characters. None of which needs explaining. To put in chronological order would be a waste. What's the point? Bruce Willis as a dying cop with a bum ticker, trying to save a girl who might already be dead. Mickey Roark as the super-anti-super-hero Marv who's out to die for the murder of a beautiful call girl whose murder was pinned on him.

Rourke's character is played with such empathy that you won't want his segments to end - you will want him to become the final hero of the film.

","While it's probably a total clichÃ© to say it by now, Sin City really is a wild thrill ride of a movie, and quite possibly the most entertaining thing that will hit theaters all year. Adapted by director Robert Rodriguez from Frank Miller's graphic-novel series, it's an energetic slab of Ne-noir, complete with twisted characters, ambiguous morality, and deadly serious dialog. For those who thought the Kill Bill movies weren't bizarre or violent enough, Sin City ought to seem like a stylish, action-packed gift from guy-movie heaven. It's filled with negativity, outrageously over the-top bloodletting, and some of the blackest humor known to man, but it all works anyway.It should be noted right off the bat that Sin City is not a movie for everyone, but if you're the type who would like it you presumably know who you are. IF you like crime movies, especially those filled with action and atmosphere, you will almost certainly get a kick out of Sin City. <br/><br/>As everyone (and probably their brothers) knows by now, Sin City was filmed using real actors against a black-and-white CGI background with some touches of color added for dramatic effect. It may seem like a gimmick at first, but Sin City is all about bringing the viewer into a sort of parallel universe, so this unconventional device works perfectly. Sin City is a movie dealing with lives on the edge, and it conjures up a delightfully dark, grimy, and gritty atmosphere to go match the depravity of its subject matter. Weighty themes and over-the-top violence abound here, and it's only fitting that the movie's look and feel should be so uniformly haunting. Consisting of three tangentially related stories occurring out of sequence, Sin City brings the viewer into an underworld populated by thieves, murderers, hookers, and dirty cops, and the morality is viewed entirely in shades of gray. In the Basin City of the movie, where the good guys are bad and the bad guys are even worse, violence is often a virtue, or at the very least a prerequisite for survival. If there's one redeeming value to Sin City's cartoons ultra violence, it's that it's painfully clear that its recipients generally deserve it.<br/><br/>Anyway, if there's one theme running through all of these stories, it's that of redemption. The protagonist in each tale (Bruce Willis's Hartigan, Rourke's Marv, and Clive Owen's Dwight) is a most unlikely hero (although Hartigan is just a regular cop and therefore not exactly bad, whereas it's clear that Marv and Dwight are murderers), but each finds himself driven to acts of extreme courage and sacrifice in order to see justice done. Sin City portrays a kind of heroism not typically seen in movies (especially big-budget, sanitized Hollywood productions), one that comes from doing the right thing even when it's nowhere near being the easiest thing. Rourke's Marv is probably the most memorable character, a hulking thug with a highly overdeveloped sense of vengeance who managed to arouse some of my sympathy even as he cut a swath of unimaginable destruction through his enemies on his way to avenging a murdered prostitute. Out of the legions of other figures in the movie, the great Benicio Del Toro deserves some special mention as a comically malevolent crooked cop who won't shut up even after he meets his unfortunate end.<br/><br/>Now, although I've gone on too long already, I'd feel remiss if I didn't talk about Sin City's staggering violence quotient. Yes, this an extremely graphic movie, and much of the violence is downright disturbing to watch (Elijah Wood's character being cut up and fed to a wolf is a prominent example, even if much of the violence in that case was implied), but it's just as true that context is an important factor when considering just how offensive such bloodletting is. Now, for one thing, Sin City is meant to be a piece of escapist cinema, so nothing that takes place on screen should be taken too seriously anyway. After all, no one got offended during the scene in Monty Python and the Holy Grail when King Arthur cut off the Black Knight's arms and legs; that scene was meant to be funny and it was. Perhaps more to the point, the violence here is so ludicrously over the top from the opening scene that it's hard to imagine any rational person getting too upset. You have to just go with it; if you're the kind of person who makes it a point to be huffy and offended all the time you shouldn't be seeing this movie anyway. 'Nuff said"

","To hell with my earlier review. Sin City is one of the best movies of 2005.<br/><br/>Three dark, twisted, neo-noir stories of love, revenge, and duty spiraling through the shadowy back alleys and street corners of Sin City, the worst city you can imagine. First and foremost, the visual style: the visual style is stunning. Presenting the dark metropolis as a thick, oily chiaroscuro of black white that segues in dappled palettes of red, yellow, and blue, the movie perfectly captures the gritty film-noir mood of the old movies that Frank Miller so successfully emulated in the graphic novels. It's a fevered nightmare: a dreamlike image of hellish corruption and crime.<br/><br/>Filled to the brim with over-the-top violence, boobs, and blood, Sin City is the penultimate graphic novel adaptation. Each story is jam-packed with action and plenty of disturbing images that'll haunt your mind long after you've seen them. While not perfect, (corny dialog and occasional slow parts,) Sin City remains the single most faithful comic book adaptation, and one of the most entertaining."

Owen's narrations are just sick, and with in the plot they were all the more unbelievable.<br/><br/>I can't really express in words how awesome this movie is.

"titan-28","10","0","4","23 October 2006"," One of the Best Movies of Our Time...
","""Sin City"" is a flawless movie. I really can't find anything wrong with the movie. It has everything you can ask for. It has an awesome cast with tons of famous actors. A great storyline even though it is four separate stories they all interlock with each other and happen relatively at the same time. Lots and lots of violence and great dialogue, it is a balance between narratives and non-narratives. Also the very stylized look to the movie is amazing. It is in black and white with only certain things in color, such as blood or a certain feature on a character. This movie is nothing like I have ever seen before, and I give a lot of credit to the originality. It is also amazing to know that while shooting this movie they hardly ever used a set, where as most of it was filmed in front of a green screen and all of the buildings and surroundings are digital. But why it is so amazing is that the buildings look so real, you can't even tell that they really aren't there. If you are looking for a great story you will be pleased. If you are looking for lots of action and blood you will be pleased. If you are looking for great characters and memorable dialogue you will be pleased. If you are looking for something different you will be pleased. I don't know anyone who didn't like the film, and they people who don't I don't understand why. The only people I can see having a problem would be those who don't like a lot of violence or coarse language. However the interesting stories can almost make it up for the non-violent fans out there. This is one of my favorite movies of all time and easily one of the best ever."

"fuzzysham13","10","0","2","19 October 2006"," Bad people doing good things.
","Sin City, great movie. This is one of the few movies I feel deserves a 10.<br/><br/>Frank Miller created these amazingly flawed characters. Marv, a violent alcoholic who is obsessed with finding the murderer of his mistress. Dwight, a criminal on the run who wants to protect the women he loves. And Hartigan, the one good cop among many corrupt ones. The characters are ones people can relate to.<br/><br/>There are three separate but intertwined stories. Starts off with Hartigan 8 years before. Hartigan just wants to stop a serial rapist. Next is the story of Marv. A semi-crazy man trying to avenge the unjust death of his mistress. After that is the story of Dwight. Dwight basically just wants to protect the women he loves. First the bar maid, then Gail. The movie ends with Hartigan getting out of jail to save Nancy.<br/><br/>I remember when I first said ""I want to see that movie"", a couple of people looked at me and asked why. They couldn't understand that the movie was not so much about corruption, sex, money, fame, whatever as it is about doing the right thing."
"mr_popcorn","9","0","2","19 October 2006"," ""An old man dies. A young girl lives. Fair trade. I love you Nancy""
","I bought this on DVD days ago and decided to watch it on a night time to get that that dark and gloomy mood that people who've seen it was talking about. So, the film starts in this balcony of a building or som'n and we see The Salesman (Josh Hartnett) kill an unlucky target. Then, we see ourselves in a prologue of one of the three story lines ""The Yellow Bastard"". Hartigan (Willis) rescues an 11 year old Nancy Callahan from a freak pedophile nincompoop from the powerful Roark family, Junior Roark. This is the first scene where we see the brutality, Hartigan shoots Junior like it was traget practice and he shoots his ""manly organ"" off. But then, out of the blue, Hartigan's long-time partner, Bob (Michael Madsen) backstabs Hartigan and shoots him like he was target practice, thus, the tagline ""Hell of a way to end partnership"". Bob was on Roark's payroll, so it has got to be done.<br/><br/>The next scene delves us in the second storyline, ""The Hard Goodbye"". Its basically about Marv (Mickey Rourke) killing his way through the top and finds the murderer who killed Goldie (Jaime King) while she is sleeping with him. The dialogue in this part is outstanding and Mickey Rourke portrays Marv like he IS Marv. Minor characters in this part includes Kevin, (Elijah Wood) a cannibalistic SOB who eats prostitutes for dinner. LITERALLY. We also see some of the Old Town prostitutes like Gail (Rosario Dawson) who has a much bigger role in ""The Big Fat Kill"" and Wendy (also portrayed by Jaime King) who is actually Goldie's twin sister. Like all movies, the protagonist kills the antagonist brutally and the protagonist dies with content. Marv got his revenge.<br/><br/>The next storyline (The Big Fat Kill) is about Dwight McCarthy (Clive Owen) whos trying to save Old Town from the evil dictator and mercenary Manute (Michael Clarke Duncan). Nothing to talk much about this storyline but this was also good. Brittany Murphy, Benicio Del Toro, Rosario Dawson and Clive Owen gives off a good performance and as usual, its brutality at its finest. After Dwight offs Manute and his thugs and restores the truce between Old Town and the cops we return to ""The Yellow Bastard"". We see a bed-ridden Hartigan and Senator Roark (Powers Boothe) who tells him that when Hartigan is up and running, he will connect all the crimes (child molesting and the castration of Junior) to him and he'll serve jail time. Hartigan with all his misery gives up and loses hope but that ended when Nancy writes to him every thursday under the name ""Cordelia"" and with all his happiness, decides to live and content with the letters he receives. Then, the Yellow Bastard (Nick Stahl) comes in and gives him a bloodied letter with a finger in it. Thinking that Nancy's in danger, he gets out of jail and tracks Nancy. And tracked her he did. He found a now 19 year old Nancy Callahan (Jessica Alba) in an erotic club with The Yellow Bastard hot on its tail. Hartigan lead the Yellow Bastard directly right to Nancy. With a few twists and turns, Hartigan ended up killing Junior by literally smashing him to bits and castrated his ""manly organ"" again. The sad part is, he kills himself because when he killed the Yellow Bastard, the son of the powerful Senator Roark, he lit up the match that'll make the Senator blow up and thinks that he'll do anything to kill him and Nancy. ""An old man dies. A young girl lives. Fair trade"".<br/><br/>The film, set in black and white and with the occasional touch of colors like the Customer's red gown, Becky's blue eyes and Manute's golden right eye. Robert Rodriguez with the special directing of Quentin Tarantino, gives us a new but an entirely new film in its genre. The brutality, the lighting, the score, the directing and the grimy and dark locales of Sin City makes this film attracts to the audience and one of its kind. Kudos to the people who've worked hard to create such a visual masterpiece. 10/10."

"martin-1301","10","0","1","3 September 2006"," Sin City - jumped right in to my all time top ten movies
","Sin City is a very dark, enigmatic, episodic, film about Basin City. It is a day-in-the-life type movie with no morals, no happy endings and almost no story line. You are irresistibly drawn to the anti-heroes Marv, Dwight and Hartigan, who meter out a violence that is extreme but not gratuitous - mainly due to the strip-cartoon feel of the film.<br/><br/>Sin City is shot mainly in B&W with colour used sparingly and more as a special effect. The use light and shadow starkly enhances the squalor of Basin City. The photography is stunning! The dialogue is clipped, gritty and original with strong reference to the strip cartoon genre; including the muscular and effective use of narration.<br/><br/>With a Pulp Fiction type of post modernism, this is remarkable piece of art that stands above all of what Hollywood produces today."

","Basically sin city revolves around three characters Marv(played by Mickey Rourcke), Dwight McKarthy(Clive Owen) & Hartigan(Bruce Willis). The cinematography was corny but intentional, the directing from Miller & Rodregez was steady with some minor input from Quentin Tarantino, I was impressed by several performances including Mickey Rourke in the years biggest comeback role, Benicio DelToro as Jakie Boy (a very sinister role), Jessica Alba as Nancy, but the biggest shock was Bruce Willis's role I'm sure he is getting better with age.

","This is a classic example of Quentin Tarantino at his best although he is only a special guest director I can see the same filming style. It is a similar style to that of ""Pulp Fiction"". There are three stories told within one movie, and like in most Tarantino each character is somehow involved or seen in each other's stories.<br/><br/>In ""Sin City"" you get to know each character through their inner dialog, making it all the more intricate and it has a much better effect than when the character speaks aloud.<br/><br/>You learn to love the people in the movie even when they have done something wrong because you learn about how each character really feels. Also the movie is filmed in black and white, but there are things occasionally filmed in color that add a really awesome effect to the movie. Such as the blue eyes of Kevin, while everything is black and white, his eyes are blue which makes the movie all the more enjoyable.<br/><br/>This movie I highly recommend and think that it is an amazing movie and I look forward to the sequel."

","Sin city is based on the comic book with the same name, drawn and written by Frank Miller. The movie is also directed by Frank Miller and Robert Rodriguez. Quentin Tarantino is also directing a few scenes. The movie is very true to the comic book, and every scene is an exact copy from the serieruta. The actors are characteristic to the characters in the comic book and therefore it demands loads of make up and masks to made the movie authentic.<br/><br/>The movie is about Sin city, a town with bad cops, bloodthirsty inhabitants and killer hookers. There are three stories in the movie that weaves together in Old town: an area in Sin City where prostitutes rules, violence as much as sex.<br/><br/>The first story is about Hartigan (Bruce Willis) a police who is on his last case before retiring. Hartigan is hunting an obnoxious paedophile that raped and killed loads of children. Now he's got Nancy Callahan and Hartigan knows she's in big danger. Hartigan saves Nancy Callahan, but what he doesn't know is that the paedophile is Roark Jr, son to the man who rules Sin city. Hartigan takes away Roark Jr both his weapons (the gun in his hand and the thing near to his groins with which he'd wounded so many children with) by fire his gun. But Hartigan pays a price for what he did. Roark's father makes sure that Hartigan gets sentenced to prison for the crime his son made. Nancy Callahan knows that Hartigan is innocent but she can't testify, then Roark and his team will kill her. Nancy writes one letter a week to Hartigan while she is in jail, and by that, Hartigan knows that she's okay. But after nearly eight years, the letters stop coming. Hartigan must save Nancy (Jessica Alba) from Roarks Claws. And the only way to get out of jail is to confess the crime he didn't do.<br/><br/>The second story is about Marv (Mickey Rourke), a violent man who's not on anybody's side. He occupies himself with beating bad cops and hooligans, that have lead to Marv's face being totally maimed. No one wants to spend time with him, not even prostitutes who are paid for it. But although he gets to spend a night with the most beautiful creature god made, Goldie (Jaime King). While they are asleep, someone comes in to the room and kills Goldie. Marv, who thinks Goldie was an angel, demands a bloodstained revenge.<br/><br/>The third story is about Dwight (Clive Owen) whose girlfriend Shellie (Brittany Murphy) is bother by her Ex Jack (Benicio del Toro). Jack hits and humiliates Shellie and that makes Dwight indignant. He wants to teach Jack one or two. Dwight haunts Jack into Old town were Jack gets killed by the prostitutes: Miho (Devon Aoki) and Gail (Rosario Dawson). Too late they've got to know that Jack was a cop and not any cop, the cop who arranged that Old town could be a free zone for the prostitutes to make their own rules. If the surrounding world gets to know that Jack is dead, Old town will become a battlefield and in fast tumbledown. Dwight, together with his only true love: Gail, has to do everything in their power to save Old towns privilege.<br/><br/>OBS! i'm Swedish so forgive my bad grammar."

It contains everything, ranging from poetic scenes, like the opening, to action scenes, where there are so many I can't list.<br/><br/>I love how everyone has a motive in the film, even if you have to figure it out yourself. It doesn't obviously state things like every other movie, and it's not all based on the violence - That's just a really cool bonus.<br/><br/>When you see the characters, they tell some of their stories, you just get attached to their personalities.

I must admit my favourite was elijah wood, when watching the lord of the rings, I found his voice to be very annoying, and I hated the was he made his scenes very camp with Sean astin. So I was very surprised when he didn't say a word, but made a convincing psycho, who gave Marv a run for his money, before eventually being fed to the dog, and he didn't even scream!!! Visually stunning, this was helped by Alba cowgirl routine and also the prosthetics on Rourke and stahl were very creative and fitting. Hartnett's role was a very short one, but I found his role very poignant, a great way to start the film and then a cool way to end it. The dialogue was brilliant as expected from Miller but it also took me back to authors like Raymond chandler and the great dedicative stories of the pass.<br/><br/>Very engrossing, cool, slick and well made definitely a film to go and see."

","this movie was all kinds of bad--- miller has fallen and fallen hard. rourke's performance and the slick visual style of the movie not withstanding, sin city has absolutely no redeeming features whatsoever. the plot, character and dialog clichés we're practically quantum, the overall mood and message was negative while the gratuitous violence seemed to serve no other purpose than to graphically and painfully illustrate how completely warped and out of touch miller's sensibilities have become. the most laughable and ridiculous aspect of this turkey was the way women we're depicted. it was like if he gave all the whores automatic weapons and ninja powers it would compensate for the fact that in sin city all women are either gun-toting homicidal hookers or victims of depraved psycho killers. film noir this was definitely not. millers comic book stuff was innovative and fresh back in the 80's, but if anything it seems as if either his muse has taken a hard left or the guy just doesn't have what it takes to make a watchable movie. probably a little of both. i'm sure a lot of fans are gonna disagree big time, but i'm sorry--this movie completely missed the mark."

","Damn again! Man if you like comics books and you want to see your imaginations come to life, then you should consider reading Frank Miller's Sin City and watching this damn movie! Its EXACTLY as if the comic book came to life!!! My God! I was astonished, intrigued and most of all damn impressed with this damn good movie! This movie features 3 stories from Basin City (Sin City itself).You've got Marv's story (a thug who avenges his one-night-stand's death), where Marv is played by a brilliant Mickey Rourke in what I believe is the best performance of his life. Then you've got Dwight McCarthy's story (a private eye who saves Sin City's whore town from an all out war with the cops) Dwight being played by Clive Owen is good and stylish, but he lacked the grace of Rourke. I felt like Owen didn't embrace his character as much as Rourke did. Rourke had even the minutest details covered like Marv's awkward stretching and even his smirk.<br/><br/>The last story is Hartigan's story (a old cop who protects the victim of his last case from a rapist). Hartigan is played by Bruce Willis, Willis being as brilliant as ever. But again I didn't quite feel the graceness of the character as Rourke's. But he was brilliant and attained near perfection in my list.<br/><br/>There are a lot of ""dames"" in this movie - Carla Gugino, Rosario Dawson, Jessica Alba, Brittany Murphy and a lot other prominent members. But I thought this was more the man's flick than the girls. Though there were some good performances and damn good action scenes, especially Miho (Devon Aoki)the silent assassin of the whore town.<br/><br/>The narration angle of the movie combined with an equally good direction is TOO brilliant, with each of the main characters getting the chance to 'narrate' his way through the story. I thought that was a VERY cool angle as it made the movie more comic-ish. Also the blood, the shoot-outs, the punches and even the car crashes all seem to have been directly ripped of the comic into the 3-D world. You actually feel like you're in the movie and won't feel the 2 hours slip away so calmly.<br/><br/>Don't be put off by the black and white screens. They actually make the movie truly comic-ish. This is a heck lot more than your money's worth. I bet you anything that you'll buy this movie's DVD. AND if you're watching the DVD be careful. The movie has VERY DARK scenes AND some nude scenes packed. This movie is NOT for the weak hearted!Be warned! Oh and just for the statistics, this IS currently #63 in Top 250 movies here at IMDb AND more that 35,500 including me voted 10/10. So there ya go. Everybody loves it. Just watch and throw me a punch if you don't like it. Deal?"

","A great movie. Filled with action and a nice storyline. Very cool one-liners. The characters are dark and filled with anger. Marv, for example, is muscular, has a face full of scars and some kind of mental problem. I can't exactly explain why but this movie is the best I've seen in a few years. You'll feel the same way if you like: action, dark humor, blood and cool one-liners. This movie is based on the comics of Sin City. These are published in black/white. That's why this movie has a black/whitish look, which is good for this grim film.

"tildmj","8","0","2","8 June 2006"," i felt this was one of the best pieces of cinema i have seen in a long time
","sin city was by far the best film i have seen in recent history (although i am yet to see crash and have heard it's very good). it was very stylised giving it a very unique feel to it. there clever use of colour with certain characters or key moments was very effective giving the audience a different view on what cinema is. i felt that the voice overs of the main characters works quite nicely and is very true to the original script as are most of the key scenes. obviously the three main actors are mickey Rourke, Bruce Willis and Clive Owen who were all very good in their roles although there were many other big actors who played small parts throughout the film. mickey Rourke was my favourite actor in the film as he was absolutely perfect for the role considering they practically look the same. i thought he remained very true to Marv and brought the character to life especially with his lasts words on the chair, ""hurry up i ain't got all day"". i thought Bruce Willis portrayed Hartman very well as a caring cop willing to do anything to protect a innocent girl. i had just scene him in hostage so i knew there was a compassionate side of him which was shown well in sin city. Clive Owen was good in his role but i felt he didn't quite fit the character. i personally think they should have used a much slimier actor than him like Mikael Douglas but he made the role work. overall i think it was a true piece of art and any complaints of the story line running more like a group of short stories id simply evidence of it's authenticity to the novel."
"TheFilmProf","8","0","2","6 June 2006"," A challenging film, and not for the squeamish
","It's grisly. It's gory. It's grimy, gritty and gloomy. It's Frank Miller's ""Sin City"", and it's not rated 'G'. But despite all the seemingly negative adjectives, this is a stylish film; a film that is as much, or maybe more, about visual form than it is about narrative content. Many viewers--most, probably--will find it difficult, if not impossible, to separate the form from the content, but for those who can, or are willing to try, this is a film worth seeing. But be warned: it's not for the thin-skinned, tenderhearted or squeamish.<br/><br/>""Sin City"", short for, or perhaps a better name for, Basin City, is a place where crooked cops, hookers, thugs, hard-boiled characters and tough language abound; a place that comes with its own form of law; its own form of justice. Based on Mr. Miller's graphic novel (read: comic book), it's a remarkable piece of film-making, despite the level of violence, which some would argue is too much--a point with which I would not wholly disagree. Yet beyond that is a neo-film noir, and one that--also arguably--is, or should be, defined more by its stylistic elements than by its narrative development.<br/><br/>Shot on digital video, which may make the use of the word 'film' a bit of a misnomer, most of what you see doesn't really exist. Backgrounds and graphic elements were created and designed to be absolutely faithful to the original comic book look and inserted in what's known as 'green screen' technique, based on an old Hollywood trick called a 'traveling matte' (which used a blue screen), and later adapted for television, where characters are shot in front of a green screen,with the green later being replaced by the backgrounds during post production. The technique allows for the original style graphics to be created separately from the main action, giving the director much more freedom and much more control over the final image. Hollywood's traveling matte system was used more as a cost-saving device that allowed actors to be placed against any stock footage background from of any location in the world, without having to actually get them there. Now, it's a technique that plays directly and in this case, very effectively into the very essence of digital film-or-video making.<br/><br/>Though co-directed by Mr. Miller and Robert Rodriguez (""El Mariachi""; ""From Dusk Till Dawn""), with a scene directed by 'special guest' Quentin Tarantino (who was paid one dollar), the film is consistent in its approach, and bold, very bold, in its style. Primarily and particularly noticeable is that the film is in black and white with splashes of color highlights: a red dress; green eyes; a two-tone '57 Chevy station wagon (Mr. Miller was born in 1957)--it is captivating to watch, maybe inexplicably so. Replete with comic book style visual foregrounding, wide angle perspectives and wonderful pulp novel dialogue, combined with cinematic techniques of high-contrast shots, odd, dutch angles and silhouette lighting, ""Sin City"" is a tale of justice, vengeance and retribution. and one that is both visually and aurally cynical.<br/><br/>Several loosely connected, related episodes are linked together in a plot structure that is book-ended by the plight of John Hartigan (Bruce Willis), the only honest cop left in Sin City. With a bad case of angina and soon to retire, he takes on one more case, only to be gunned down by his own partner Bob (Michael Madsen.) The story then picks up on the leonine, and very large, Marv (a virtually unrecognizable, Mickey Rourke), who is, no doubt, the king of all the beasts who inhabit Sin City. Toss in a few other colorful--though still black and white--characters--Jackie Boy (Benicio Del Toro) a crazy, corrupt cop; Dwight (Clive Owen) a tough and loyal ex-journalist, and Kevin the cannibal (Elijah Wood), and you get an improbable, yet effective plot.<br/><br/>Still, questions about ""Sin City's"" depictions of violence will arise, and criticisms will be leveled, and making judgements may not be easy, nor as black and white, as the film itself. To watch it, viewers will be viscerally challenged; but to understand it, the challenge will be intellectual.<br/><br/>© 2005"

Also, they cam together with another brilliant man, Frank Miller, to create a master piece about his vision, the original Sin City story. Everyone in the movie is perfectly cast (I am a fan of the novels, so i know who should be cast) and they bring the characters right off of the pages of the comic.

"c-blauvelt","10","0","1","25 April 2006"," The Ultimate Fulfillment of My Film-Noir Fantasies
","If the ""Hays Code"" had never been imposed upon the Hollywood film industry in the early 1930s, ""Sin City"" would probably be typical of most films made in Hollywood today. The film industry felt it was necessary to police itself against some of the film-noir excesses of early 1930s movies. American filmmakers produced many crime films in the early sound era, many of which were considered immoral because of their seedy content: the breakdown of law and order in favor of criminal activity; the failure of society in favor of selfish, material interest; and, of course, sexy dames scantily clad, often involved in murder, alcoholism, and drugs.<br/><br/>If Hollywood had remained unchanged, American films probably would have evolved into ""Sin City,"" a celebration of vigilante justice when the state itself has become a criminal entity. Beheadings and whores are commonplace on the streets of Sin City, but with all its decadence, there is a certain primal morality to this universe that redeems it. It is as if the modern city were the site of a new Stone Age, where the population is divided between various factions or ""tribes"" who fight for the survival of their respective factions. They just happen to be playing out this tribal warfare in the context of post-modern urban decay. All of our major protagonists are concerned with correcting some injustice. We have Marv (Mickey Rourke) seeking justice for his murdered lover, Goldie; Dwight who wants to protect the prostitutes of Old Town from the mob and police corruption; and Hartigan who seeks protection for Nancy Callihan, the girl who he saved from a child molester years before. These three narrative threads are woven together seamlessly into a beautiful neo-noir tapestry.<br/><br/>The most obvious aspect of the film is obviously its unique visual style. Every shot in the film is based on a corresponding panel from Frank Miller's original graphic novel series of the same name. Director Robert Rodriguez so admired Frank Miller's original vision that he demanded that his film evolve into a ""translation"" rather than ""adaptation"" of the novel. This film is supposed to be just another experience of the graphic novel itself. In fact he was so determined to give Frank Miller co-director status that he resigned from the Directors Guild of America. Frank Miller, after all, had visualized the film initially, since Rodriguez used the graphic novel as a storyboard. With the exception of a few set pieces, the film was shot entirely against a green-screen with the backgrounds and landscapes of the city digitally added later. The black-and-white cinematography gives a fantastical luridness to the look of the city that makes the setting seem foreign and exotic, a beautiful stylistic complement to the film's theme that life thrives in the shadows. The low-key lighting creates a chiaroscuro effect that makes the actors extremely attractive, turning them into the sexy anti-heroes and femmes fatales that made the film-noir genre so appealing in the 40s.<br/><br/>Interweaving the three major story lines creates a standard film noir narrative structure of vengeance and retribution, violence stemming from sexual tensions, and individuals acting to restore order and justice when the state has failed. I've never been the biggest fan of multistory film narratives, finding them often to be choppy and inconsistent. However, there are enough character connections between the three stories to make them seem like they are just aspects of one mythology, an exploration of character and decision-making. In my opinion the most interesting of the three stories is the second, about an impending factional war between prostitutes, the mob, and the corrupt cops. I think it best represents the failure of the state to maintain its monopoly on violence and the necessity of individual factions to fill the void of the state's policing power. The Big Kill scene is spectacular, with such gritty, hardboiled poetic dialogue like this line from Dwight: ""The Valkyrie at my side is shouting and laughing with the pure, hateful, bloodthirsty joy of the slaughter... and so am I."" What insightful narration! To have such introspective dialogue shows that this character understands what it means to live in a film noir universe where the medieval age has been revived in the bowels of the decayed urban environment.<br/><br/>The most brilliant structural devices in the film are the karmic bookends. At both the beginning and the end Josh Hartnett's character assassinates a woman. He appears to be a contradiction to this world of factionalized anti-heroes and femmes fatales. He seems to be working for himself rather than aligned with any particular group. I feel that he embodies the intangible justice and harmony of Sin City. If someone who has committed an injustice, like Becky at the end of the film, Josh Hartnett's character will have vengeance if somehow the factions weren't able to solve their problems. He acts as a balancing force, tying up loose ends, restoring harmony to the system just as a free electron facilitates the bonding of a hydrogen and oxygen atom to create water.<br/><br/>Sin City is a beautifully shot, sociologically complex film about rational decision making in a structure-less environment. It is not for the faint of heart, but its social commentary through poetic language makes it a very rich film. It will make all your film noir dreams come true."

","I absolutely love this movie. It is less of a movie and more of a graphic novel on film. The gritty underworld of Basin City from the Graphic Novels is translated perfectly onto film. The otherworldly characters are brought to life brilliantly. I know some complain about the cheesy dialog, graphic violence, and overt sex, but believe it or not, its all part of the story. But I must warn those of you who can't take much violence, you probably will not like this film. It runs of death and gore. In all the story lines that go into the film the protagonist must literally kill his way up the criminal food chain to discover whats really going on. I still suggest you see the film, but be prepared, and don't watch on a full stomach.<br/><br/>This film represents the next step in the Film Noir genre and its both a step forward and a look back, technology goes forward, while the acting goes back to those great early films that invented the Genre."

","Okay, so this is obviously an ultra-violent film. Not all that unexpected coming from Robert Rodriguez, but still, what this film lacks is substance and humor thrown in. After the pitiful 'Once Upon a Time In Mexico', I am sad to say this film is even worse. It does have some redeemable qualities, though very few. The comic book look that has been created specially for this film is very well done, though it leaves exactly the same impression that 'Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow' did, in that, after the visuals, there isn't much left to see. The film is, even with the action, extremely boring towards the middle. This film could have easily been cut down to 90 minutes, and it should have been. What is more disturbing than the violence in this film is the supposed acceptance that surrounds it. Their is little justification behind it, almost no regret about carrying out this kind of violence. Severed limbs, incredible amount of blood and gore...the violence out weights the sex seen in this film. And American's complain when romantic comedies have explicit sex scenes? What is the world coming to? This violent culture has let Sin City get away with this, as well as encouraging more. Sin City is not trash, it's decent. But ranking it up close to masterpieces such as the Lord of the Rings, which has so much more emotion, the violence and killing is questioned, raises so many moral issues...this film clearly needs to be put in its place, next to Titanic. One of the most overrated films in years."

","Not many adaptations from a comic book to a movie are so successfully done as what is presented to us with Sin City. All in all, you should at least tell that every single aspect in this movie is treated with lots of care; from the portrayal of the neo-Gothic dark alleys of the setting, to the perfect depiction of amorality through its characters.<br/><br/>In what concerns the translation from comic book to film, there are no flaws in the result, no rough corners to smooth. If you enjoyed the read, it's safe to expect you will like this as much. If not  it's as sane to say you won't.<br/><br/>Definitely, what you should ask this for is not a merry-go-round ride to any colourful world. From the, in the best possible sense, ghastly and interesting aesthetics to the overly dramatic dialogue, not one inch of ground on Sin City retains political correctness.<br/><br/>This movie is an insight to a corrupted society, a kill-or-be-killed system, much of it in first person. Giving us an accurate narrative from the main characters' point of view; and these characters, the protagonists, aren't exactly heroes. Bruce Willis, Clive Owen and Mickey Rourke all play the star of the show in different stories, and while I thought Owen's the most forgettable, their interpretations (as well as, I don't deny, the rest of the cast's) were excellent.<br/><br/>Well directed, shot, with intriguing camera angles and sequences seemingly taken directly from the panels, not to mention the overly effective plots, Sin City earns a well-deserved 9 out of 10. And, assuming they are prepared to some blood splatters and dark humour, I don't doubt anyone else will like it too."
"cwrdlylyn","9","0","1","7 April 2006"," SIN CITY : Fascinating Visuals, Great Ensemble, & Overall Cool...
","SIN CITY <br/><br/>Is it possible for a movie to be great simply b/c of how f-ing cool it is...? The answer, for me at least, is yes. SIN CITY, directed by Robert Rodriguez & Frank Miller, is an adaptation of Frank Miller's classic Gothic comics. It tells three stories, chosen from a large list, all set in Basin City. Basin City is a rundown, crime-infested town where thugs, murderers, and whores are all fighting for their own right to survive... and it's a fascinating movie.<br/><br/>A big deal was made about the visual style back when the film came out... and it damn well deserved the attention. The stylization Rodriguez uses here is stunning... it's a black and white tableau that utilizes splashes of vibrant color to emphasize different things. Whether the color is used to emphasize beauty (Goldie), evil (Yellow Bastard), or the simple elegance of a woman's red lips it is always stunning to behold. But what makes SIN CITY so stunning is the way it takes grime, evil, and violence and somehow makes it seem like an artistic mural.<br/><br/>But SIN CITY has a lot more then stunning visuals going for it, it's also got some incredibly engrossing performances. The entire cast does what they are supposed to do... whether it means fully conveying a torn character of brute strength (like Mickey Rourke's Marv) or whether it simply means be hot as all hell (like Jessica Alba's Nancy). No actors here really dig into nuances, but it's not necessary in a film so purposefully extravagant. Instead, the actors seem to embrace the outer extravagances of their characters and build a character through that. It all makes for an incredibly stylized ensemble.<br/><br/>What's also so refreshing about the movie is that, while it easily could have solely depended on it's style to make a good film, it opts not to. The three individual stories told are incredibly fascinating and exciting... and while they do act as three separate pieces, they are integrated together very smoothly into one package.<br/><br/>It is truly a wonderfully directed film overall. Though Frank Miller got Co-Director billing and Quentin Tarantino was brought in as a Guest Director... I think most of the praise belongs to Rodriguez. He has managed to edit together a moving comic book. The voice-overs from the actors work perfectly with the visuals and the pacing. Instead of using camera tricks to mask a boring scene... he only enhances scenes that are already wonderful with his visual touch.<br/><br/>It's hard to really pin-point what it is that makes a film like SIN CITY so damn good. It's the kind of movie that perhaps you should just sit back and soak up the ""coolness"" for what it is. It's a popcorn flick without anything to say that will change the world... although it's visual styling re-defines what film can accomplish when it comes to visuals.<br/><br/>If there was a deep message I was supposed to get out of SIN CITY for some reason it was lost on me... but I sure as hell enjoyed the film enough to watch it again and again to find out if there is one. And if I never find one, SIN CITY will still be one of the coolest and most artistically interesting films I've ever seen.<br/><br/>... A ..."

","""Sin City"" are a well-known series of comic books written & illustrated by the legendary Frank Miller. Set in a fictitious rotten city named Basin, Miller tells several stories about life and death in the criminal world of Basin, lovely nicknamed ""Sin City"". Just like his masterpiece ""The Dark Knight Returns"", Miller's style is harsh and violent, but not without a good dose of dark humor that fits perfectly the black and white film noir style of his stories.<br/><br/>Like the comic books, ""Sin City"" is a collection of neo-noir tales but what sets the movie apart from other comic-book adaptations, is the fact that director Robert Rodriguez used the books as storyboard and literally shot everything Frank Miller had conceived. As a result, the movie is a literal adaptation of the stories, without changes or additions, staying so true to Miller's writing and drawings that Rodriguez considered him basically another director.<br/><br/>Three stories and a short-tale are told in this beautifully photographed movie. ""The Customer is Always Right"" presents Josh Harnett in a short tale perfect to introduce us to the brutal world of Basin City; Bruce Willis plays honest cop John Hartigan chasing a sadistic pedophile in ""That Yellow Bastard"", while Mickey Rourke gives the performance of his life as a tough criminal looking for vengeance in ""The Hard Good-Bye"". ""The Big Fat Kill"" is the closing story narrating the desperate effort of Dwight (Clive Owen) to stop a war between gangs.<br/><br/>Taking the conventions of film noir to the extreme, the duo of Rodriguez and Miller crafted a thrilling roller-coaster that never loses steam. Miller's dialogs and design are translated perfectly by Rodriguez and his camera-work. Rodriguez makes great use of digital effects to create a flashy black & white world that at times has some color. Just like Basin City's criminal life. However, despite the script and the camera-work, the movie would not be the same without the performance of the star-filled cast.<br/><br/>Bruce Willis is superb as the aging John Hartigan, who tries to make justice in a town forgotten by God. Jessica Alba shares the screen with Willis and is irremediably overshadowed by his performance. Willis proves that he is more than an action film star. A lot has been said about Mickey Rourke's performance, so I'll just add that this is the role he will be remembered for, as he completely absorbs the character of Marv and makes him truly believable.<br/><br/>Clive Owen as Dwight may not be perfect, but he still gives a worthy performance and carries his segment with grace. However, it is worth to notice Benicio Del Toro's acting, practically stealing every scene he appears. Michael Madsen, Elijah Wood and Rutger Hauer are only some of the many talents involved in this movie in supporting roles. Among them Devon Aoki shines as the mute Miho, projecting a strong presence without saying any word.<br/><br/>At first sight ""Sin City"" may look like another violent action fest, but this movie truly is more than that. With well developed stories, great acting by the cast and an original neo-noir visual style, this movie excels in every artistic department and is destined to be considered a classic in the future. Not only fans of Miller's comic books will enjoy it, it is definitely a must-see. 9/10"
"xredgarnetx","7","0","2","4 April 2006"," A real comic book of a movie
","SIN CITY is a living, breathing comic book of a movie, not surprising since it is an adaptation of a graphic novel by former BATMAN writer Frank Miller. The production values are some of the best I have ever seen, combining live actors with CGI and matte sets to create a near-flawless visual experience. What the episodic movie lacks in plot, it more than makes up for in some terrific acting and great gobs of graphic gore, nudity and violence -- the last three being some of my favorite things. The only thing missing was a decent sex scene. In the first story, Bruce Willis shines as a -- what else? -- grizzled, older cop trying to stop a child killer. In the second story, Mickey Rourke plays an over-the-top quasi-superhero with a fright mask for a face (shades of real life!) up against a veritable army of goons who are killing prostitutes. Clive Owen and Benicio Del Toro costar in the third and final episode, which is about two quarreling guys and a gal -- well, actually, make that gals, lots of gals, and all of them great looking. Touches of BLADE RUNNER, KILL BILL, PULP FICTION and BATMAN can be felt throughout. SIN CITY is aimed primarily at a young and hip crowd familiar with today's stylized comic books. All others, beware. You won't be seeing this on regular TV anytime soon."

","Forgive me father for I have sinned, I had told people that the film ""Sin City"" was going to be one of the most profound realistic films about a society of corruption, egoism, and shame. Father, after I saw the film I found that to be not true. Father, even though those three elements are incorporated in Robert Rodriguez's avant-garde film ""Sin City"", it was not flashy or sentiment enough for me to evoke on a crusade to minimize the problems in our society. The film is comprised of three separate stories in the fictional town of Basin City. The first one fixates itself on a thug named Marv who seeks revenge on the murder of a prostitute named Goldie. Father, we should bless actor Mickey Rourke for his mesmerizing work here. Father, to quote Toni Basil ""Mickey you are so fine in this film, you blow my mind, Yea Mickey"". The second narrative fixates on a savor-type named Dwight McCarthy who helps a beaten waitress and ends up in a ruckus by unknowingly killing a cop in a part of Basin City controlled by prostitutes. The slick Clive Owen was sturdy as McCarthy and Rosario Dawson leaves you hooked in her work as the mama hooker Gail. The third Basin City fairy tale fixates on an aging cop named John Hartigan who is falsely charged with child molestation even though what he was trying to do was save a little girl from being raped by a monstrous pedophile. Lucy, the young girl, grows up and before you can say ""albacadabra"" transforms into the luscious Jessica Alba. Yes! ""I Love Lucy"". Hartigan eventually follows the ""yellow brick road"" and is a Lucysaver again by skirmishing with the pedophile who now is transformed as a horrifying villain named ""The Yellow Bastard"". Bruce Willis successfully plays Hartigan as a Die Hard John McClane archetype character. The film's stories are adapted from famed comic book writer Frank Miller's bizarre comic tales of Basin City. Miller co-directed the film with Rodriguez and, get this non pulp fiction, included Quentin Tarantion as a Guest Director. Father, Rodriguez is a technical innovator and should be commended for his cinematic revelations but somehow I felt bored in ""Sin City"". Maybe I thought that it wasn't Miller Time when I would hear the ridiculous banter of Miller's scribed words from the characters of ""Sin City"", or maybe it was that there was not a central message within the mildly connecting narratives , or maybe it was just that I wanted to see the ""raw"" version of the infamous Alba dancing on the stage scene. Father, whatever it was forgive me for my marginal critical film review of ""Sin City"" . *** Average"

","Okay let me tell you about the cast first, I mean, how they were able to get all these people together to star in this film, I do not know. I am still in awe of them all. Clive Owen, Benicio Del Toro, Josh Hartnett, Bruce Willis, Jessica Alba, Rosario Dawson, Alexis Bledel just to mention a few. It was great that all these people were there because I just enjoyed watching them, I didn't like the plot nor am I or have I ever been into Sin City the comic or anything like that. I went to watch to film purely based on the hype, and it delivered, to an extent. Okay, Bruce Willis plays an aging cop who suffers from angina (a heart condition) who saved a young girl once from the clutches of evil by way of the son of a tycoon (played by Nick Stahl), fast forward like 10 years later and the little White girl he saved grows up to be Jessica Alba's character, a hip swaying-lasso swinging bar dancer whom he comes face to face with much later in the film. Meanwhile, there's the character of Britney Murphy, a lousy waitress who is having an affair with Clive Owen's character behind her boyfriend's back, by the way her boyfriend is played by Benicio Del Toro. There are so many stories within the context of this one film but trust me they are all connected. Rosario Dawson (who showcases the best acting in this film) plays the leader of rebel prostitutes out to save their own necks and Josh Hartnett's character is an assassin. Oh, and Elijah Wood is also here too, in a silent and annoying role."

","Sin City may possibly be every man's dream; guns, car-chases and women. Robert Rodriguez' latest movie is a treat for the eye, it looks stunning and the features are the movie's best part. Loaded with famous faces, the story mainly switches between Mickey Rourke's brutal ""manimal"" Marv, Bruce Willis' ass-kicking ex-cop Hartigan and Clive Owen's confident Dwight. Three macho men who makes their way threw (Ba)Sin City, each with different stories to tell.<br/><br/>Marv, a badass and chief among the underground-residents, has started his hunting season. He's on the look after the guy who killed his true love, the whore Goldie. Newly pensioned cop Hartigan, a man with a machine heart, who's protecting a young girl, Nancy, from the city's worst criminals. And Dwight, Shelley's secret lover, who's spending the nights protecting Gail and her ""Old Town Girls"" from the violent Jackie Boy.<br/><br/>Sin City is brutally entertaining, and it's packed with memorable scenes and quotes. Every piece of the movie's drenched in merciless and stylish cartoon-features - and every single character is either so stylish, so beautiful or so ugly that you simply can't go anywhere but to Sin City to find them. The action-scenes are stunning, and the stories are brilliantly put together (as originally they're three different novels), switching between Sin City's darkest alleys in a cool and hard-knocking tempo. And the movie's got a edgy noir feeling to it, shot in black & white elegance with only some colors revealed you can't avoid being amazed by the movie's looks. There are a couple of blue eyes, red Converse shoes, a yellow bastard, some red blood spoiled - and this keeps it even more interesting. Sin City is a killer-movie, though many will probably find it more silly than intelligent, and yeah - Sin City is nothing more than a cartoon-based rock & roll movie."

","I thought the movie itself was spectacular. I've never seen anything like it and quite frankly it was refreshingly original. I am not into comic books in any way, but this movie drew you in. It was, at least in my opinion, sheer brilliance. A bit of unnecessary violence though!<br/><br/>I loved all of the scenes. I liked how all the actresses and actors (they had the most amazing cast) were all joined up. ONe story linked up to the next one.

"caw001","8","0","1","4 March 2006"," Superbly Entertaining
","After watching Sin City, I can only say one word that properly sums up the experience: wow. Sadly, the rest of this review will be just an expansion on that.<br/><br/>The film, co-directed by Robert Rodriguez and comic book legend Frank Miller, tells a story not really about people, but about the town that has trapped them. Sin City is a grueling Gotham ripped right out of the deepest, darkest regions of film noir. The formula for Sin City is to take everything you know about the noir genre and take it to the 10th power. All the cops and politicians are corrupt. All the women are strippers and/or prostitutes, and everyone will shoot you in the face without thinking twice. Against this backdrop, stories of hope, redemption, and revenge are told, and notice that I said ""stories"". This film doesn't have a linear plot, but rather ping-pongs between various short stories for two hours. That might be enough to scare away the casual moviegoer, but those who do walk in to see Sin City will be glad they did.<br/><br/>One of the first things people will notice about the film is its unique visual style. Rodriguez really pulled no punches in trying to make this film an almost picture perfect adaptation of Miller's comic book, and it works to amazing results. There were times where I thought that the storyboard artist just cut out panels from a Sin City graphic novel. As a comic book fan, although not really familiar with the Sin City comics, I like to believe that movies are movies and comics are comics. I've seen attempts to try and bridge the two mediums (ahem ""Hulk,"" ahem) and I've seen them fail, too. In this movie, Rodriguez takes his cue from the comics themselves, making his movie look like a comic, but feel like a movie. The film incorporates comic book aesthetics, but doesn't use the same self-referential techniques that basically wink at the audience. And I know that everyone is praising how good the movie looks, but this is the most stunning movie of 2005. You can't watch it and not be awed.<br/><br/>Also, a part of the visual style of the film is that Rodriguez chose to graphically show many moments of violence. I'm a strong supporter of the leaving of extremely graphic violence to the imagination. While it does add to the shock value and the ""in-your-face"" attitude of the film, some parts were just plain gross and could've been left out. I mean, honestly, I don't need to see Bruce Willis tear Nick Stahl's genitals off, no matter how brief the shot is.The black and white (sometimes) color palate of the film really emphasizes the violence. There is very little grey in the movie, giving everything a hard, edgy look. Rodriquez uses color in his frames like an artist, in order to make the ideas pop. Sometimes, blood is traditional red, contrasting with the hard blacks and whites, but some other times, excess blood is colorized paper white. It's jarring, drawing the eye to it, and yet still leaving the viewer thinking, ""God, this is so cool!""<br/><br/>The movie has a lot of star power, but all the characters aren't that different from each other. As stated earlier, the movie uses a lot of conventions of the film noir genre, and if you know what you're looking for, the movie will feel like a walking genre convention. A lot of the actors speak in the same, monotone voice that would be confusing if I weren't looking at who was speaking. And I'll admit; I like seeing women who can kick butt. However, when every single woman who appears on screen looks beautiful and is competent with many styles of firearms, it gets a little repetitive. Plus, the obligatory voice-overs are present in all stories. Once again, the casual moviegoer might find these conventions annoying.<br/><br/>But in the heat of the moment, while watching the movie, you're just captivated by what's going on on screen. I love the sense of ""hope sprung from hopelessness"" that appears to populate most Distopias like Sin City. And I think that's what keeps the movie compelling. Visually, yes, it's captivating, but a movie that's all flash and no bang won't stay with you like Sin City will. This film has substance: the tragic nature of Sin City itself mixed with characters you care about, albeit some more than others.<br/><br/>I loved this movie. There are some parts I can nitpick at, like the feeling I get that the film went past its natural ending to tie up a loose end I didn't care about, but for the most part, I think this is one of the best comic book films ever made. It's not ""Citizen Kane"", but the biggest achievement of this film is that there is no other film like it."

","This film is good, no wait, it's awesome! There has never been a film that has completed me like this one before. I would recommend this film to absolute anyone and that is a promise!<br/><br/>The film is divided into three different plot lines each linking to each other in one way or another. The characters have all seen each other at a sleazy bar in 'Old Town' of Basin City, the womens territory which has been outlawed towards the cops. Mickey Rourke (Marv) is absolutely fantastic, his character is well suited towards this film and it would be a sin in itself not to cast him as one of the leading roles. Devon Aoki as the deadly little 'Miho' is the sexy, silent assassin who is just getting used to the glory or blood splatter fusing in Basin City. Jessica Alba (Nancy) is simply incredible, there is not a single shot of her that doesn't make you want her! Bruce Willis (Hartigan) is one of the honest cops on his last day of the job because of a fragile heart condition, however he spends 9 years protecting Nancy from a sadistic paedophile who almost raped her when she was only a child.<br/><br/>The best thing that i love about this film (apart from its original digital black & white screening is the childish 'hard man' style the main characters each have. What i mean by that is it will take about 8 bullets for Hartigan to sit down and 2 rounds in the electric chair brutality to eventually kill Marv.<br/><br/>I give this film 10/10 and always will. By far the best film to come out in 2005 and i look forward to the release of Sin City 2."
"pharmhog","8","0","1","4 February 2006"," Is that all ya got"" pansies in a big trunk
","This is film noir at its best. For the uninitiated, film noir is a movie characterized by low-key lighting, a bleak urban setting, and corrupt, cynical characters. And this film has this type of performance oozing at all violent, mal-adjusted points. What more can I say? Even on the small screen, this was a pleasure to watch. The splashes of color add so much contrast to every scene. I love the irony. The good guys are the ones to watch out for and the bad ones are compelled to provide their own brand of self imposed justice.<br/><br/>For all of the positives, there were a few things I found awkward. The narrative, at times, got to be distracting. The male characters seemed interchangeable because of their delivery.<br/><br/>Despite these minor issues I had with the film, it is a must see. It is a unique look at the under-belly of a world got mad. A world in which things aren't what they seem. Sin City reminds me of several other films. Most notably are the spaghetti westerns with Clint Eastwood and, sad to say, The Chronicles of Riddick. The point being that sometimes evil must be fought with another kind of evil. I feel Sin City is presented thematically in much the same way.<br/><br/>If you get the chance, take a peek at this one. It is not for the little ones by no stretch of the imagination."

It is not every day you see something like this. But still... the stories were better on paper, and the beautiful pictures, that the movie too catches, work much much better with real stills. The richness that Mr Miller has achieved in his comics, is hidden between the pictures, and it is really hard not to compare the genius of the comics to the movie.

"StainGirlLives","8","0","1","5 January 2006"," sex and violence
","Sin City, based on the graphic novels by Frank Miller, incorporates three stories, set in the fictional city of Sin City. It seems the only people living there are criminals, prostitutes and strippers, and little girls growing up to be strippers. Consequently all women appearing in the movie are sexy and scarcely dressed, and all men are rough, tough and scarred. This makes the movie a dick flick: sex and violence, for some men a wet dream, I guess. But this doesn't mean a little girl like me can't enjoy a movie like this.<br/><br/>The movie is stuffed with comic book clichés, but what did you expect? Thank god the girls are not constantly scared and screaming out 'Oh please help me!'. These girls bite back, and that makes up for them all looking gorgeous and being half-nude. Besides, bad boys can be sexy too.<br/><br/>Besides the sex, many people complain about the violence in the movie. I must say sex and violence are two main themes in the movie. I can't remember any real sex-scenes, or any shocking positions performed in complete nudity. The 'sex' never was embarrassing to look at, unless off course you faint when seeing a nipple.<br/><br/>The violence was so over-stylized, it never made my stomach turn. Actually you never really see anything so disgusting it would make you sick. It is being told that his guts were smeared out all over the place, but you actually don't get to see it. The moment a dog wants to start eating a certain person, the screen turns black and white: white figures moving in front of a black background. No matter how disgusting some characters are, no matter how creative the ways to make people die (in a most painful way), unless you have a very weak stomach, it won't make you puke.<br/><br/>Enough sex and violence. Let me tell you a bit about the story and the characters. As I said there are three main stories, based on the story lines of three Sin City-books: 'Sin City', 'That Yellow Bastard' and 'The Big Fat Kill'. The movie begins and ends with lady killer 'The Man' (Josh Hartnett). In between we get: the story of Hartigan (Bruce Willis), a good cop, who tries to save little Nancy Callahan out of the hands of a child rapist/killer, who really gets turned on by little girls screaming; the story of Marv (Mickey Rourke) revenging the death of the only girl he loved; and the story of Dwight (Clive Owen), who tries to prevent all hell breaking loose between the prostitutes from Old Town and the cops, as a result of the sad passing of crooked cop 'Jackie Boy' (Benicio Del Toro). The cast is impressive. Besides the men already named, we also see Jessica Alba, Michael Madsen, Rosario Dawson, Michael Clarke Dunkan, Brittany Murphy, Elijah Wood,  Most of them perfectly fit the kind of character they are supposed to portray: the lined faces of Bruce Willis, Clive Owen, Michael Madsen and Benicio Del Toro makes them believable as genuine troubled men. I would particularly want to congratulate the filmmakers for the casting of Elijah Wood as Kevin: the creepiness of his big blue eyes has never been displayed in such a perfect way.<br/><br/>I have already mentioned the over-stylized way the movie is shot: the directors have stayed very close to the way the comic book itself is styled: black and white with a drop of colour once in a while. It is as if you are watching a comic book, where the figures have come to life. It all seems very unreal and surrealistic in the beginning, but after a while you get sucked up in the atmosphere, in the world of Sin City, and in the stories. You forget that the real world doesn't look like that, that real people don't need about twenty bullets pumped into their body to die, and that just looking at yellow bastard only dressed in short pants, would make every real person immediately scream. Also the voice-over by the main characters in each sequence (The Man, Hartigan, Marv and Dwight) take a while to get used to, but it gives extra depth to the story, it gives you a bit more insight in the motives, and it often gives what you are watching a relativising and comical note.<br/><br/>I really liked this movie. It was visually new and challenging. The story doesn't need too much thinking and is quite surreal, yet it isn't incredibly ridiculous and stupid, nor is it absolutely unoriginal. It is based on a comic book, but in most comic books (and movies) the distinction between heroes and villains is as clear as black and white. Sin City heroes are everything but angels, and the villains are absolute perverted psychos. There is only grey and the blackest black. And somehow this makes the heroes more real, there is no idealism, no moralistic crap, no false pretences, and in the end, no absolute heroes. The way the story is told makes the darkness complete, without ever making it too heavy or depressing. Just sit back en let yourself get sucked into it."

","I liked the movie! Interesting story... It left me guessing about how much is reality and how much is fiction in it. Some of the fighting scenes were decidedly computer-manipulated, but I'm still trying to figure out how much punching and bulleting is possible to get without kicking the bucket already, like in Marv's case.<br/><br/>The movie speaks a big truth that accurately describes politics, i.e. that power is based on lying, especially for politicians like Senator Roark, whose whole careers rely on convincing people that what they hold to be true is actually false, as long as it serves their career (read ""money"") interests.<br/><br/>The movie also had a peculiar cinematic effect, the selective coloring of particular body parts or just a car, etc., while everything else around is black and gray. This special effect adds to the overall grim, obscure atmosphere of the movie in a very suggestive way. It's a dark movie that features no daylight. This indicated to me the writer's/director's wish to convey a message about the dark side of power, meaning that if you want power, you've got to play hard and dark, to expose yourself to a lot of emotional and physical violence and all the evil that accompanies it."

They all go in a storybook mode, with imagery as graphic as brain surgery, and the action then takes place.

","Very, very Mild Spoilers. A quote and things like that, nothing worldshattering.<br/><br/>Sin City is a great movie, and it is made with an attitude I like. Now, you seem to have a whole lot of people bitching about CGI, while I understand their grieves, it is not CGI that is the problem, it's how it's used. CGI is a tool, to blame tools is a strange thing to do. Here, you really have a movie that uses it well, what am I saying 'well', lets say: 'brilliant'. The combination of the CGI, how the camera moves, what happens in the screen, and how it is edited is actually magic, real magic. More doesn't need to be said of that. It's jawdropping amazing, and shows what really can be done with CGI.<br/><br/>Now, as for the content of this movie, I didn't know anything about the Sin City comics. But that didn't really matter. The stories are hard and testosteronerised, which one would expect and I presume that in this age of advertising etc.. everyone somewhat knows what to expect. It's also called Sin City for a reason you know. The movie has 3 story lines, which are just 3 events in the Sin City world. The best of these 3, or my fave, is the one with Marv. I'll focus on that one here, because I just love it. It is incredible. The way Marv escapes the cops, by jumping of the stairs flying trough a rain of bullets, it's breathtaking, and immediately makes a point, this is no ordinary guy. Than we have a conversation between him and a Naked Carla Cugino! One of the hottest women in Hollywood(check out the movie Judas Kiss where she plays Coco Chavez, for further proof). But back to that conversation, when Marv says this: 'This is blood for blood and by the gallon. These are the old days, the bad days, the all-or-nothing days. They're back! There's no choice left. And I'm ready for war.' He's waving his arms around, and the gestures he makes, they seem so grand, it almost has something religious about it, like something ritual or holy, just the gestures he makes there. It's beautiful. The entire Marv segment is incredible, the jokes(the coat, the way he interrogates a guy while driving him down the road, literally.), Elijah Wood's mysterious menacing character, When Marv is waving his axe trough some cops and you think back of the words Dwight said about him,'waving his axe on an ancient battlefield..',... It's just too good. And Mickey Rourke is perfection, although totally unrecognizable, I hardly think anyone could have played the role like that, hell, I don't even think Mickey Rourke could have played like that. The other two story lines are good also, very good even, but it would take too long to go into specifics on each of them.<br/><br/>There seem to be some people who are complaining about the degrading portrayal of the female characters. Euhm, sorry, but that is a bit stupid, isn't it obvious, that this isn't a real world? That this world is one of hookers and gangsters. And I wouldn't call the women in this movie weak characters, the hookers are very capable of standing up for themselves. Are they portrayed as lust objects? Yeah, but so what? This is a world that is just like the fantasy of a seventeen year old, and you may be sure, that women are lust objects to most 17 year olds, hell, they are lust objects to most any year olds. Lets not be hypocrites about this, who doesn't like to look at a hot woman? It's just nature. So, really that whole fuzz is just a bit too exaggerated. Lets not be crippled by political correctness please, this movie is not, and if you don't like that, bad luck. Also notice that the three story's all go about defending/revenging a woman, so really the whole thing is just overblown. It's a violent movie, and that is made pretty clear, so why get upset on the movie because it's violent?(to women, while the women are simply just violent too.)<br/><br/>Some people may also complain that it's overstylised or something like that, well let them whine, cause baby, this kind of style, is just absolutely divine.<br/><br/>Anyways, I think I made my point, it's an incredible film. The acting is impeccable. The Marv segment is delicious and sublime. The whole movie has a wicked style. And I like it. It's new and fresh, and we finally have a movie that really does something with CGI. I hope I will be seeing more things like this."

","the extraordinary work from three genius's are very highly talented directors. the use of colour to the superb black and white back ground this is really taking Tarantinos style and copying others for his own unique style for example such as Schindler's List. the colour is used superbly in the right spots and the connotation for colour in this film can be debated between hope and intensity or anger and problems. with the enigmas that come to follow when starting the film intrigues the audience.The target audience could be specific as someone stated or the audience could be spread wide open due to the Hollywood A list celebrities bringing their own fans also the comic book readers and also the directors especially Tarantino with other marvellous pieces as KillBill vol 1 and vol 2 and Resivoir Dog (big fan).<br/><br/>The soundtrack i can not really comment about because every single time I was this Marvellous piece i concentrate on the gore. for such fine examples as Marv killing Kevin with a hack saw. the slick special effects are extroardinary especially with Rourke scenes such as; the axe straight into the coppers head.<br/><br/>Does anyone else think that the narrator signifies the captions in the comic book. also i am wondering what scene Tarantino directs because i am confident that it is the scene where Marv is in the Tar pit with the mercenaries.<br/><br/>these extraordinary films should be credited with a gold medal at the Olympics with every single gold medal. this masterpiece should be rated 10 out of 10 by everyone.the first time i watched this film i was amazed and more a less got down to my knees and thanked the lord for the best film i have seen since God knows when."

","Being a fan of Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez's previous collaborations and given the very impressive cast, I highly anticipated Sin City as a great piece of movie-making entertainment. Simply put, it exceeded all of my expectations and then some. Much was made of Sin City's striking visual style, and for good reason. While the visuals made it amusing to watch, the characters and performances made it fun to watch. Rodriguez and Frank Miller triumph in bringing the spirit of the graphic novels to life in each of the three major segments. Sin City is a rare mix of style and substance that hits all the right buttons and leaves its intended audience wanting more. Those too easily offended by the movie's over-the-top violence probably won't watch it to begin with. Sin City, for my money, is the most entertaining movie to hit the big screen in 2005. It's a one-of-a-kind extravaganza in a land full of copycats, and it's sure to spawn some cheap imitators."

"Lt_Coffey_182","10","0","2","22 November 2005"," Only negative comment - It stops!
","There have been many attempts to turn comic books in to film but all of them, including X-Men and Spiderman, have not been worthy of their original format. Sin City is the first film that has been completely loyal to its comic book and do itself justice. Frank Miller was on board for this film to make sure this film stuck as close to his Sin City graphic novels as possible and it is probably because of this that the film and Robert Rodriguez met their aims.<br/><br/>Sin City contains three of Miller's short stories and this does a great job to break the film down in to digestible chunks for the viewer; preventing boredom and allowing for the action never to let up. All three stories are very well written and are full of wit, action and great performances. A great theme throughout the film is the traditional image of a man fighting for and protecting a woman. Two of the short stories are about a man doing anything to keep a woman alive and the other story is about a man finding the truth behind who killed his only love and avenging her death. This gives Sin City great romantic undertones and gives this immensely dark film a glimmer of positive energy.<br/><br/>What sets Sin City over its peers is the fantastic comic noir style as it immediately draws attention and gives the film something new to offer. The fact that this film appears so colourful despite the fact it is mainly in black and white is a testament to the imagination and imagery that occurs on screen. The clever inclusion of certain objects and features being presented in colour is done very effectively and further shows how loyal to the comics this film is. The scenery in the film is amazing. The neo urban feel is very complimentary to a place called Sin City and is definitely not a wasted effort. This film perfectly demonstrates the importance of effort as Rodriguez and Miller pay great attention to detail and do very well not to turn Sin City in to just another big budget romp. Anyone looking for thrills will be immediately turned on by this film as it has pounding music, spectacular special effects and intense set pieces. The gruesome imagery gives the film its shock value and enhances the rousing nature of the film. Never will there be a film as entertaining as this.<br/><br/>Sin City's most memorable feature is the characters (almost all played by a known actor) as they all have such strong personalities and are so offbeat and edgy. By far, the best character is Marv (Mickey Rourke). His dialogue is by far, the most entertaining and assists in formulating a likable yet psychotic character. Mickey Rourke is an actor who never achieved his potential but it appears Sin City may have resurrected his career after giving such a fine performance. There is a huge contrasting element within Marv's character in that he is bitter and twisted, but cares for anyone who shows him an ounce of affection. This is what makes Marv such a complex character that you can't help but be taken in by him. Watching someone bust heads with such attitude is always a pleasure to watch. Bruce Willis as Hartigan is the other stand out performance. His tired cop character is a great development from Willis' Die Hard days and his narration over his scenes is very compelling. His character's determination to save and protect Nancy is very admirable and, like Marv, means he has the audience's immediate care. The rest of the cast all do very well and all provide great intense performances. It is impossible to comment on everyone's performance as the film is such a big ensemble.<br/><br/>With awesome imagery and adrenaline pumping scenes, Sin City is uncompromising and relentless in forcing the audience to enjoy themselves. Outstanding on every level, Sin City is the best film of the century so far and will take some beating."

"hellspawn7","10","0","1","21 November 2005"," Show me a flaw!
","If Frank Miller or Robert Rodriguez don't get Oscar hype for this film, then the world is not itself. This is quite possibly the best ensemble piece in the history of cinema (ranking with Ocean's eleven, or even Lord of the Rings. This is what it means to be faithful to your source material. The Sin City books (which I have now read and cherish) are unlike any comics today, and they make for a perfect movie with Film Noir motifs, but enough about the books. Frank Miller did the right thing by getting this movie made, some of his previous dark books (i.e.: Batman: The Dark Knight Series) have been made into successful forms of media, but this film dominates over all. The story of the film is divided into a few chapters actually (being 3 large stories and small opening and closing one) with three (and a small fourth) leads. The first major story is about a stone cold (in many ways) killer named Marv (played perfectly by the only living actor who could have possible have played Marv; Mickey Rourke) who sets out on a quest for vengeance for a hooker with a heart of gold that gave him the night of his life and runs into another killer of a different sort (played by Elijah Wood who is a far cry by the 3-foot tall Hobbit) and a cannibalistic cardinal (Rutger Hauer), this segment is the most violent, yet the best story of the film. The next involves a killer named Dwight (Clive Owen) who gets tangled up in a plot to bring down a band of hookers (led by the exotic Rosario Dawson) and manages to take down a bully cop (played by an unrecognizable in appearance and voice Benicio Del Toro) and a giant of a crime lord (Clarke Michael Duncan). The final story, which starts before the Marv story and resumes after the Dwight story is probably the best-acted and written one. It has a heroic cop named Hartigan (Bruce Willis) and his last day on the job, he rescues a 11-year old girl from the clutches of an untouchable child rapist (Nick Stahl, who goes from the savior of humanity in Terminator 3 to one of the nastiest villains on screen). Hartigan saves the girl, shoots the rapist and ends up being framed for the girl's kidnapping, rape and murder of the guilty rapist and spends 8 years in prison. Hartigan then believes that the girl is still in danger and manages to get released and finds the girl has grown up to be the not so innocent Jessica Alba, an exotic dancer who is now in love with Hartigan. They are then chased down by the surviving rapist who is now a mutant psychotic. This film goes above and beyond in every aspect, especially in the narration. The whole film is shot in front of a green screen so it's loaded with CG sets and environments, but you can't always tell (that's a good thing). If you held the book up next to the screen for most of the scenes you'd find an uncanny likeness that no other film has done as well. The babes are hot, the guys are cool and the writing is for lack of a better word, perfect. This film is the best film of 2005 and certainly the best comic book movie and should be going head to head with Crash at the Oscars this year. Mickey Rourke is the actor they should be handing Best Supporting Actor to. Not for kids, the film is overly (but joyfully) violent and has scenes of sex and nudity but don't let that big (well earned) R stop you from worshipping this film. Only one small problem, doesn't effect the film itself, but the DVD has no special features."

","Wow, Sin City's trailer alone is a piece of art, two hours of black-and-white whore's, rugged-ass guys and lots of blood, is exactly why Sin City has become one of the best movies of 2005. It being shot entirely in front of a green-screen has clearly worked cause the movie is visually stunning, black and white with several color accents, just like in the comic books.<br/><br/>Sin City however has only depicted three stories of three men in Basin City: Marv, the huge, violent caveman in search for the killer of his beloved Goldie, John Hartigan the ex-cop that has been framed and sent to jail by the powerful Rourke and Dwight McCarthy, he brings an end to the truce in Sin City between the whores and the powerful people who run the city. This minor selection of stories had people hoping for a sequel and their wish has been granted. <br/><br/>Ten years ago, when the comics were popular(not that they aren't now), who would have thought that there would once be a movie that would actually live up to everyone's expectations. Robert Rodriguez made that possible with personal help from Frank Miller and even the well-known Quentin Tarantino who had the honours of directing a scene in the movie.<br/><br/>To sum all my senseless babbeling up: Sin City is the reason why people watch movies, Amazing acting(Benicio del toro), beautiful colors (Becky's eyes) and fantastic cinematography make Sin City into what it is, watch it and you'll see what i mean. 10/10"
"orizano","9","0","1","16 November 2005"," Almost as good as the book
","As a fan of the books, I really enjoyed seeing the pages come to life on the big screen. Too bad too many newbies had problems with what they perceived to be continuity issues. Perhaps they would have followed thing easier if the stories were presented as three vignettes, although that type of thing usually doesn't fly too well in theatres. I can't wait to see the DVD version where I can watch the stories individually. Perhaps more people will have a better viewing experience when they have a chance to see the stories on at a time. I've heard that the next movie ""A Dame To Kill For"", which precedes ""The Big Fat Kill"" will be the sole source for the next movie. That should alleviate continuity issues. Anyway, ""Frank Millers Sin City"" is a pretty wild near-noir ride for mature folks. Mickey Rourke does the best job of channeling his character, Michael Madsen doe the least credible job, with Alba not too far from him. But it doesn't matter - as a whole, the movie is good."

","Robert Rodriguez has a reputation of blowing things up, making a lot of noise, creating a lot of fire, a lot of chase scenes (in any ways) and a lot of shootings. It's a well-earned fame because that's one of the things the man does; but come on! He's big now and things could change but he directs, produces, writes, scores and edits his films. It's admirable from any angle you view it. None of his films is a wonder for me, but at least now I know I've got to see ""El Mariachi"".<br/><br/>I grabbed a seat and watched ""Spy Kids"" some years ago: pure joy. After generating a new type of childish adventure piece, where the real heroes are the kids (and sometimes the whole family); he made the sequel: not as good but still promising. What was next? Why not three dimensional cinema? Is it to crazy of him; to take chances? His third deliver of the spies wasn't the most watch able experience, but it was an improvement; and it had Sylvester Stallone.<br/><br/>The ones who didn't like the 3-D stuff wouldn't be interested in what was coming; fire, fights and guitars in ""Once upon a time in Mexico""; a great ride if you ask me, but not if you ask those other guys, who would answer ""that's not film-making"". Anyway, the amazing Johnny Depp was there, and he's not the kind of actor who participates for the money (even though he's got to earn it); there's always something more for him and he saw that. I also got the chance to see Enrique Iglesias acting, fact I thank Rodriguez for; but that's a fan thing.<br/><br/>All of the things above are a warning; because if you want to call the man a genius now, you're too late. Now you're going to say that blood everywhere works, like when you praised Tarantino's style in ""Kill Bill""? Because ""Sin City"", while not a masterpiece, is the work of a master; a genius. Don't blame a director for overfilling the screen with effects when he's giving you one of the most incredible pieces of entertainment of the year! Because in the end what is cinema all about?<br/><br/>The things Rodriguez did to finalize this movie his way, you wouldn't believe. What he had to sacrifice so Frank Miller could direct his life and work alongside him. And that's what they did; marvelously. Their directing work shows innovation and passion in every possible way; starting with the total lack of background: risky. Or the black and white shooting, which can be tedious (like in Tim Burton's ""Ed Wood"") but not if you manage it correctly. The precise touches of colors, yellow and orange in details as signs or a box of pills, or a blinding red in intense parts; because red is so much I don't need to explain.<br/><br/>Blood is red, sometimes, or white in other occasions. Cars are blue, and blue is the constant mood factor of all these characters in the final line of their lives. Consider Marv, who's willing to give his life for a woman that, he finds out, is nothing more than a prostitute. Consider Hartigan and his crucial words: ""An old man dies; a young girl lives: a fair trade"". This is the language in Miller's world, I suppose. I didn't read the graphic novels, but I assume it could be like that: short, cold; accurate. At least that's what you get from Dwight's voice, while he talks in present tense, as the rest.<br/><br/>What about girls? Men's motives, of course; as it should be. What keeps them going. About the cast I'll talk, but I won't say a name. I'll say tat Rodriguez called some people who had worked with him before (no, not Banderas), and included some new participants. It's a flawless ensemble, and even if some actors appear only for a few minutes, they deliver within their limits. I couldn't believe my eyes the first time I saw the trailer.<br/><br/>What the future has prepared for these two has positive results written all over, but if they get lost in the way, as we do in their movie, they can always go to Kadie's, the only place where the divided parts become one, and the colorless obtains color."

Original and amazing.<br/><br/>Digital Effects- Perfect, no other word for it. The black and white city is simply compelling on its own, but the splash of deep red blood or icy blue eyes adds something stunning which just can't be described. I only wish i had been to see it on a 20 ft cinema screen, it must have been magical.<br/><br/>Script- The script give all the characters personalities, you really believe these are people with history's, flaws and feelings.

","It's ultra-violent, it's sexist, it's bloody, it's vicious, and it's not Tarantino. Robert Rodriguez, Quentin Tarantino's best friend (they sometimes refer to each-other as 'brothers'), brings us the latest Tarantino-fest. It's called Sin City.<br/><br/>I never considered Robert Rodriguez to be a genius, nor a good filmmaker. His repertoire includes such masterpieces as ""From Dusk 'Till Dawn"", ""The Faculty"", the ""Spy Kids"" trilogy, ""Once Upon A Time In Mexico"", and more. Just to make it perfectly clear, that last sentence was completely sarcastic. Sin City is, hands down, his best movie, and also the only one of his movies that's actually any good. And yet, the next project he chose for himself is titled ""The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl in 3-D"". That should explain it all. It always amazed me that the same director that directed From Dusk 'Till Dawn (one of the most violent and gory movies I've seen) also directed Spy Kids. And yet, somehow, he does it.<br/><br/>With Sin City, Robert Rodriguez brings us his next violence-fest, and also (somehow) one great movie. And violent is an understatement. Sin City is VIOLENT. It is not for the weak stomached, nor for the weak-hearted. Anyone who can get past that part, though, and stomach the ultra-violence, will have a blast.<br/><br/>Sin City is based on the comic book series written by Frank Miller. Miller was very hesitant when he was approached regarding the making of the movie. He had a bad experience when something he wrote was completely butchered by Hollywood, and changed into an ultimately horrible movie (Robocop 2). Rodriguez managed to convince Miller, though, by telling him that Sin City wouldn't be an adaptation of the comic book, it would BE the comic book. Rodriguez committed to making his adaptation of the comics as accurate as possible. And thus he did. Sin City is literally identical to the comics. There isn't even a screen writing credit, because no screenplay was written. The plot and all the dialogs are lifted directly from the pages of the comic books. And that's not all: Rodriguez used the comics as storyboards for the film. The shots and overall look of the film is EXACTLY how it is in the comics. Rodriguez even gave Frank Miller credit as director, even though he didn't direct a minute of the movie. Rodriguez claimed that Miller's comics were such an important part of the overall look of the movie that he had to give him credit.<br/><br/>Sin City isn't only unique in that sense. It is also unique in its technical aspect. The actors were filmed in front of a blue-screen, and everything else was added to the film later. And I mean everything. Not a single set was built for the movie, all the imagery aside from the actors (including cars and other objects in the foreground, not only the backgrounds) is computer generated, and added in after the principal shooting of the actors. Also, it was filmed on High Definition Digital film, which makes Sin City the first fully, 100% digital motion picture.<br/><br/>Sin City also showcases an outstanding visual language. The entire film is in high contrast black and white, like the old film-noir movies, save for a few objects in the frame. An example of this can be seen in the following image: Even if you're not into the plot, or the characters, the film is simply gorgeous, and a treat to look at.<br/><br/>I won't say that the acting is top notch, because it isn't amazing, but it isn't bad, either. No performances really stood out, but they were all quite fine. What I can say, though, is that the cast is absolutely sensational. The cast includes: Bruce Willis, Mickey Rourke, Clive Owen, Benicio Del Toro, Elijah Wood, Jessica Alba, Nick Stahl, Rutger Hauer, Rosario Dawson, Jamie King, Brittany Murphy, Michael Clarke Duncan, Alexis Bledel, Michael Madsen, Josh Hartnett, and more.<br/><br/>Plot-wise, the film is based on the first three stories in the Sin City comic book series. These three stories are intertwined within one another, Pulp Fiction-style. The plot of every one of them is fairly simple, and I won't write it here because there really isn't any point. The characters are also unavoidably shallow. None of them have much depth, and they're very black-and-white, in the sense that it's perfectly clear who the good guys are, and who the bad guys are. The main characters (three of them) are the only ones who have even the slightest bit of depth, but this depth is composed of one, single motive that keeps them going, and nothing more deep and complex than that. I was actually surprised how good I felt after seeing the movie. Usually, I only like meaningful movies. And when I say meaningful, I don't necessarily mean movies with a profound social message, or deep philosophies or metaphors. I mean movies that have even the slightest bit of depth in them. This could even mean a very simple movie that simply has ultra-deep and multi-layered characters. Sin City has none of these, and yet, I really enjoyed it, and thought it was great. Just goes to show that sometimes, movies don't have to be profoundly deep to be good.<br/><br/>All in all, Sin City is a great movie, and one awesome cinematic experience. It's definitely not for kids, though. And kids, don't try to convince your parents to take you. They'll never forgive themselves if they agree. But if you can get past the ultra-violence, you'll have a great and enjoyable cinematic experience."

","'Sin City' is not a good proposition for folks who dislike violence on screen. Tarantino contributed to this film much more than by directing one scene and having his name recorded on the screen as co-director. In fact 'Sin City' is a direct descendant of the popular culture trend open by 'Pulp Fiction' and the style reminds and gets closer in some moments to 'Kill Bill'. Rober Rodriguez may be the director, but the spirit of Tarantino co-directs all along the way.<br/><br/>'Sin City' takes the comics inspired movie a step ahead by taking the graphics of the two-colored comics books and translating them into scree visuals. The result is amazing. It also takes the comics characters and puts them on screen, as comics characters are - sketchy and bi-dimensional, forms without soul, with no pretension of character building or evolution. There is no psychological depth in a two-dimensional cartoon.<br/><br/>Folks may argue about the amount of violence of all kinds, and question if they are really needed. Well, there are different categories of comics, 'Sin City' tends to be in the rated category, and this is what the film director decided to do. Acting is actually here entering the cartoon character skin, and amazingly the only weaker performance seemed to me to be the one given by Willis, who tried to be more human than necessary.<br/><br/>Yes, of course, 'Sin City 2' is in the making, and there is talk about the third one."
"rosaishere","7","0","3","23 October 2005"," Sin City is devilishly satisfying
","This was one of the much better films of 2005! <br/><br/>This was a complex and original conversion from the popular Sin City comic books by Frank Miller. The conversion is very effective as you feel like you are watching a comic book for the entire film. The cinematography and CGI effects need special commendation, as it is these factors which combine to make probably the best looking film of the year.<br/><br/>Basically there are 3 story lines. Bruce Willis heads up the 'Hartigan' storyline. The classic good detective who is arrested on the day of his retirement, saves a poor little girl from being raped by the sadistic Nick Stahl. He returns years later only to find she is under attack again. A very decent storyline and in my opinion the best one in the film.<br/><br/>The other one sees Mickey Rourke returning to better roles as 'Marv'. A large ugly brute, he has been shown the night of his life by the hooker Goldie only to wake up to find her dead. Realising he is being set up hearing the cops arriving too prematurely he is intent to bring the real killer to justice; but ends up uncovering more than he bargained.<br/><br/>The last storyline sees Clive Owen in read sneakers bringing us the character 'Dwight'. After pursuing his lover's rough old boyfriend into the hooker dominated Oldtown, severe consequences occur when they realise that there is more to this old boyfriend than meets the eye.<br/><br/>Overall, a very decent plot, great action and a superb cast. Sure, some of the lines may sound a little corny, and it might not be everyones cup of tea- but its a comic book! Its fun! Its nice to escape reality occasionally.<br/><br/>Definitely my second favourite film of the year 10/10 (Sorry Crash was my ultimate favourite film of the past few years)"

","In many movie Willis acted, in the '90, He was the lonely guy who would save world. Maybe not understood, maybe always haunted, but at the end He would make it through, in spite of his enemies who wouldn't give up till the ""last fuxxing drop"". Now, the point is, this movie made it to the top at the box-office, cos this time Willis gives up. What?! That guy who would climb skyscrapers with only his nails, and then jump on their elevator's tubes with no clue where he was going to hang? Yeah, that's him. He shoots himself in the most dramatic scene, cos He knows that his enemies (among them there is a disturbing sick cardinal too) won't just kill him at once, but torture him for years before to finish him. The last boy scout get convinced that miracles are not part of this life. And bang.<br/><br/>The scene is set in Sin city, where the purest just killed his mom, and the politician are just sick corrupted ill people, whose sons are sick cannibal monsters, and the blocks are controlled by really pitiless gangs. The only one who works back against this forlorn hell is Hartigan/Willis, whose infinite patience is a big stick in the axx of those corrupted figures. Unfortunately, at one point He gets to understand that his sacrifices would never end, only double, and there Sin City rejoices at the view of his suiciding corpse.<br/><br/>I believe in real life there are figures like that Hartigan, continuously moving for everyone's good; call them boy scouts, or heroes, or angels, one thing is sure: the real ones are anonymous, cool as ice (and so hateful) in the front, but bursting flames in the inside. And in spite of a majority of the people who believes they do not exist, still they work out to keep the flow in the right course. Cos everything might flow, but you'll never know in which direction. <br/><br/>Lord, I haven't been writing for years an essay like in school."

And Sin City knocked my socks off! It has a brilliant feel to it. It has inspired me endlessly. The romance (not a huge lover of romance movies), the action, the comic like scenes are just too AMAZING! And the characters are great! The detail put into it by Frank Miller is outstanding. I haven't read his comics but I'm going to have to now. Let's just hope there better the film. Frank Miller would explain in some scenes what his character is felling.

","""Turn the right corners in Sin City, and you can have anything"" are the final words of the film. If you are normally a latecomer to films, don't bother walking into this cinema, because if you miss as much as the first scene of this movie, the end will be meaningless. <br/><br/>Probably the best film I have seen this year and certainly the most strikinglypowerful, Sin City is a tour de force of a neo-noir genre, its brutality adding to its brilliance. Based on Frank Miller's graphic novels, it delves away from the simple, slick violence of Kill Bill, to the sheer ferocity of Pulp Fiction. In a world where criminals make the law, Sin City represents the darker side of urban existence. There are those few still out to prove themselves for the better, whether it means dying, or spilling a lot of blood to make their point. <br/><br/>The filmfollows separate stories of three men, all of which are tied up at theend, but are different in their own right. The central story follows Marvin, an almost unrecognisable Mickey Rourke (well come back!), a remorseless,mutant-like street-fighter, out for revenge on whoever killed Goldie(Jaime King), a Goddess-like beauty who also happened to be a hooker,and the only love his heart has ever known. Clive Owen plays Dwight, aprivate investigator, out to protect his prostitute friends in OldTown, after a cop is killed there and the truce is broken. Finally,there is the story of Detective John Hartigan, played by Bruce Willis,the last honest cop in city. He is on the trail of a sadistic paedophile (Nick Stahl) who is out to kill a stripper, Nancy, portrayedby Jessica Alba. <br/><br/>The main characters are supported by one of thestrongest all-star cast known to the world of cinema, including BenicioDel Toro, Rosario Dawson, Elijah Wood, Michael Clarke Duncan, PowersBoothe and Brittany Murphy, among others. Sin City exists as black and white, with the rarest flashes of radiating colour to light it up, such as the hint of Sapphire in Becky's (Alexis Bledel) eyes, or the densered on Dwight's vehicle. This is symbolic of good and evil, black representing the dark, morose side of the city, and white representing hope. The film's underlying theme is about the constant struggle between good and evil, even if it means killing a lot of people,innocent or guilty, in order to do good. The hard-hitting message Sin City bears, speaks to our times, in which government is corrupt, and civilians are treated fairly only if they pay their taxes. The stark truth of this reality makes this film a pinnacle of cinema. Apart from this is the visual flare of the film, giving light to the fantasyelement of Sin City. The special effects are breathtaking, yet gritty.The cinematography is what really makes the film ""edge-of-your-seat"".It is fast paced at times, and subtle otherwise. The film is superiorly edited and cut. However, the visual-style does not cloud the dramatic intelligence of Sin City. Each actor is a feat to watch, from the leads, to small, yet meaningful roles like Josh Hartnett as a hit-man. The expressions conveyed on the actors faces say it all. On top of all that, it is the film's duologue that stirs up your anxiety. The duologue is simple and witty, straight out of a comic book. The narration of each character is very intelligent, and takes up more time than the actual talking. Ultimately, an instant classic, and groundbreaking feat, and above all, an eternal masterpiece!"

","I had no doubts about this film when I saw it in theaters, and honestly I am glad the way it turned out. It was simply hard-core, riveting and sexily blunt film to be portrayed from comic books. The fine choice in directors was their greatest success and actually having the maker, Frank Miller working with them was certainly a treat. I was concerned about all the big name stars working together because ego might get in the way but they proved me wrong and did sensational together. Bruce Willis and Jessica Alba had some of the best chemistry I have seen but it could have been just a twinge better...Rosario Dawson and Clive Owen give a great performance as a love-hate couple. Even though Johnny Depp was supposed to be in it, I am glad they put Benicio de Toro instead, his acting was flawless for this character! <br/><br/>I must say the visual affects were very well-rounded and the black/white with some color were an ingenious idea making it feel like it was actually a comic book."
"jediduck95","9","0","1","17 October 2005"," Great characters
","When you think there will never be another creative movie made by Hollywood, sin city and batman begins comes out. <br/><br/>Frank Miller's Sin City introduces great characters who are interesting to watch. The colors (or lack thereof) bring the emotion to the characters and the stories. The whole movie seems like a horrible dream.<br/><br/>Another great thing about the stories of sin city is that you don't know who is going to die. With other super heroes or some villains you know they will most likely survive so that they can make twenty more sequels until they hire Schumacher and he screws the whole franchise up. The many interesting characters can be brought down as soon as they are introduced. Even the secondary characters are somewhat interesting. They're not exactly thugs that stand in the background.<br/><br/>The few problems I had with the movie is how some of the lines were delivered and how some of the shots looked. Rodriguez tries to make movies fast so they won't cost too much to make. <br/><br/>But Frank miller is who is to applause here. He created the story, the look, and the characters which are the best qualities of the movie."
"diac228","9","0","1","17 October 2005"," Most accurate comic book adaptation of all time, but not the best comic book film ever
","For decades and decades not a single comic book film has managed to perfectly translate the comic book into the big screen. Despite the fact that there have been some excellent comic book films like Batman, Spider-Man 2 and also Howard the Duck (just kidding) none of them successfully totally translated a specific comic book of a super hero into film. But, in 2005, it all changes when Sin City smashed into theaters and became a surprise worldwide hit. It is a surprise because it is one of the grittiest, most violent films in recent years, and it makes over 150 million dollars at the box office. This film by no means is the best of the movies based off of comic books, but it certainly is the best comic book adaptation ever done. Robert Rodriguez almost flawlessly transfers the graphic books and brings them to life in the big screen. As long as you love Sin City, this film is a must-see. But, if you never liked those books, then there really is little reason to ever consider viewing it.<br/><br/>Sin City takes us to a world in which corruption, greed, revenge, rage, and all aspects of the seven deadly sins rule. Rodriguez and Miller both introduce us to a couple of episodes of the graphic and popular comic. The first story is about a has-been cop who does whatever he can to protect an innocent girl from the clutches of a sick twisted pedophile. The second story revolves around an outcast misanthrope who is trying to avenge the death of a woman he slept with for one night, only to realize that is going to be tougher than previously thought. The last story is about an ex-photographer who is trying to protect a secluded area run by prostitutes from the corrupt cops and the mob. The film is presented Tarantino-style, with the plot(s) not exactly moving in chronological order, but it is not as confusing.<br/><br/>Few movies lately have had as much star power as this one. Ranging from veterans like Bruce Willis and Michael Madsen to rising stars like Jessica Alba, Clive Owen, and Devon Aoki, Sin City has a very well-rounded cast full of decent actors and actresses. Each person did their role very well, but the big surprise definitely comes from Elijah Wood. Wood destroys his persona as Frodo in the Lord of the Rings trilogy and does a swell job as the creepy, quiet, and deadly Kevin; a totally silent madman whose trademark is glasses that does not allow anyone to see his eyes. Be sure to watch for a small cameo by the creator of the comic book, Frank Miller.<br/><br/>The biggest problem with the film is that if one does not like the comic book at all, odds are the film will most certainly not be enjoyed. I was never a really big fan of Spider-Man, but I really do like the movies, because they are action-packed, humorous, and has a bit of emotion running throughout the film. Raimi put his touch to the Spider-man saga, just like Burton putting his touch on the Batman films. Rodriguez did nothing to enhance the film; he wanted frame by frame exactly the way it was envisioned in the grim comic books. While to many fans this is a great thing, to others whom never really cared about Sin City and wanted to see a Rodriguez film is not going to be too happy. This is the perfect adaptation, but it is not anything more than that.<br/><br/>Sin City on the technical side is done very well. The visuals sparkle and shine throughout the film, as a matter of fact this is one of the best-looking films in decades. The music is excellent like all Tarantino/Rodriguez flicks, the camera moves at a steady pace, the film is a comic book truly becoming alive. It is violent, seriously. This movie will leave your jaw on the ground and at times looking away from the screen or covering your eyes to not see all the carnage. This is much more violent than any film Tarantino has come out with, even Kill Bill vol. 1. Expect plenty of action and disturbing scenes throughout the entire film, even though there is a lining of humor and drama blended in as well. But, like mentioned before, aside from the choppy-yet-effective editing, the cinematography, and also the visual effects, this is Miller's film and nobody else's. Nobody is adding anything extra to Sin City; it is almost word-for-word, page-for-page the comic book from beginning to end. You are whether going to love it, or hate it.<br/><br/>Bottom Line: Props to Rodriguez for showing Hollywood how to successfully take a book, comic book or whatnot, and translate it to film without taking anything away from the original creation. Casting was very good, the direction of Rodriguez is unique enough for this film to work, and visually this is one of the better films out there. But if you do not like the cast of Sin City or what goes on in it, skip this movie, because what you see in the books is exactly what you are going to get. I was never a fan of the ultra-violent stories, but nonetheless did get somewhat a kick out of this movie. As long as Sin City 2 follows the same formula, the regular fans will have no trouble accepting a sequel, but it will be tough to bring in any new fans to the world where sin rules everything. Sin City: Don't expect Desperado, don't expect Kill Bill, expect a true-blue (er, true-black and white) comic book adaptation."
"AdamBowl23","10","0","3","17 October 2005"," One of the all time greats
","I'll start by stating that I have never read the Sin City graphic novels, but I am a fan of Frank Miller's work (his work on Daredevil and Batman is amazing), so I had high expectations coming in, and those expectations were met and greatly exceeded. First off, just the style of the movie is unlike anything I've ever seen. The use of color in the black and white setting is breathtaking. The same effect was used in Pleasantville, but it was put into a new level here. Second, the stories are captivating and I didn't want them to end. You get attached to the characters and hate to see their story close. Lastly, whoever did the casting for the movie deserves a raise. Even though Bruce Willis doesn't really look the part of 60-70 year man, he plays the part perfectly, and then there's Jessica Alba and Brittany Murphy, enough said. This was one of those movies, that after I finished seeing for the first time, I immediately put on my list of all time favorites and it has also inspired me to start writing again. Can't wait for the sequels and I think Miller should consider directing more, as I can tell some of his personal touches in the movie. I like Rodriguez, but I'm still trying to forgive him for those Spy Kids movies. But Sin City is a must see for anybody, there's something for the whole family to enjoy."

","For some reason Robert Rodriguez is not interested at all in making an intellectually challenging movie but just plain good entertainment extravaganza and there is nothing wrong with that. Bergman should do Bergman films and Rodriguez his own, because people need them both. While Sin City is probably his deepest work to date (which is not saying much) it also happens to be an amazing piece of entertainment and visual masturbation. It's so striking to look at, that you feel your eyes bleed after a while. Its good old fashion pulp noir with a 21st century feel. Thank God it is rated R (a PG 13 would have truly ruined it)"

","Sin City is easily the most faithful comic book adaption ever made. The pictures in the graphic novels have literally been used as the film's storyboard and the effect is astounding.

The incredible visuals are merely the icing on top of a sumptuous filmic cake. The actors all deliver superbly (especially Mickey Rourke - who easily steals the show)and the script is razor sharp and so loaded with brilliantly cheesy one liners that you can almost smell it.

"come2whereimfrom","9","0","1","2 October 2005"," are you ready to sin?
","I can now tell you that the most eagerly awaited comic book adaptation is mind-blowing. Straight from the page into live action that's virtually frame for frame, this film simply oozes uber violence and comic style. It is filmed in black and white like early gangster noir movies of the fifties but with the violence and action turned up to eleven. This way it makes the city bleak and menacing and reflects the dark brooding nature of the characters. Hustlers, pimps, prostitutes, murderers, rapists, bent cops, every low life is here, the real underbelly of this rotten city. As each scene plays out there are flashes of colour, pill containers, headlights, fireballs and blood. The impact is similar to the little girls red dress in 'Shindler's list' except here the meanings are distorted to show the evils lurking in every corner of not just the characters psyche but also the city itself. The violence here is brutal but because it's based on a graphic novel the way it is portrayed has elements of humour, very tongue in cheek or should I say gun through head. Told in three stories under the watchful eye of the creator Frank Miller, Robert Rodriguez directs the action and really brings the novels to life. With a who's who of Hollywood making this a cast to die for and a day of guest directing from Quentin Tarantino (he just wanted to be involved in the project, his fee for one day directing was $1) you will need to go a long way to find another film this year so different in attitude and style. Sin City has raised the stakes in terms of comic book adaptations; bleak and stylised, darkly interesting with frenzied fantasy violence, I'm afraid Spiderman will never look the same again.<br/><br/>Roll on sin city 2 and 3, that's all can say."

","Hello. Those of you out there nit-picking or pointing out the small frame or two where a small part has been neglected, shut up. This film has moved way out in front as my favourite movie ever. The characters are amazing and the look blew me away. Those of you talking about how Hartigan couldn't do what he was able to do, I'm sure you've missed one small thing. This is a COMIC BOOK movie. There is a small amount of lee-way in the realism department. Hartigan could do what he does because his character has the strength and the motive. Marv may be a meat-head, but he has a train of thought (although it is only 1 carriage) and this keeps him going. All-In-All, anyone who does not get to see this movie in their lifetime has clearly missed out on a treat of epic proportions! ""Step down the right alley in Sin City, and you can find anything"""

","A combined directorial talent of the guy who brought us films like ""From Dusk Till Dawn"", ""El Mariachi"" & ""Desperado"" (Robert Rodriguez) together with the man who writes comics such as Batman: Year One & The Dark Knight (Frank Miller). You could expect some weird miss-match or a break through genre busting movie. Thankfully we get the latter with this movie.<br/><br/>I'm a huge comic book fan, but I never really liked Frank Millers work with Batman, but that maybe due to the fact I never really liked the Batman comics ! Having never read the Sin City material I didn't really know what to expect from the film, and from the opening scene which Robert Rodriguez used to seduce the other actors into signing onto his film you could tell your in for a special treat, each story is told like a separate short film but are all inter-twined within the film's framework through a central location, the local drinking establishment. The film is made up of three stories, each based off their respective separate comic books. The first story is based around Marv, played by Mickey Rourke, and his quest to seek vengeance for the murdered hooker he has been framed for. The second story is based around a character named Dwight, played by Clive Owen, who mistakenly is involved in killing a ""hero"" cop whose chosen the path of crime. The final story which concludes the film is focused on an honest cop named Hartigan, and his determination to protect a young girl.<br/><br/>The stories are told with such great screenplay, probably because each story seems to have been lifted straight off the comic book canvas, and the plot line itself may seem rather strange and geek boy, but my word does it work. In some ways it reminds me a lot of the bold attempt to bring Dick Tracy to the silver screen, but where that failed in so many departments, Sin City outshines and then some ! The dark humour is mixed with graphic violence not for those with a squeamish complex, definitely a ground breaking film and the digital filming, (actors were filmed against a green background and then later in the editing room the actual backdrops were added), adds a touch of real quality with the occasional use of colour not just thrown in for good measure but actually making a point Probably one for the testosterone fuelled young boys in all of us men, great visuals mixed with good looking babes, and a killer story line, literally !"

","Sin City is not only my personal favorite film of the year thus far, but has also quickly crept up my list and into my top 20 favorite films of all time. Two theater viewings and several home viewings later have solidified it's place with the best in my book. Call me crazy, but there is something infectiously appealing about a 1930's noir-esquire styled film with memorable characters and dialogue, plenty of violence and insane scenarios such as the ones presented for the crazy characters to get into and out of. Of the three stories, I feel that ""Big Fat Kill"" was my favorite. It was the most ""out there"" of the lot, even more so than ""That Yellow Bastard"" or ""The Hard Goodbye"", which were quite strange in themselves. But the journey from point A to point B in ""Big Fat Kill"" is so much more jagged, with plenty of uphill/downhill zigzags galore, and I believe it will be the story most people will forget to mention or at least will mention it the least, giving it a bit of an underdog quality.<br/><br/>So, if you have yet to see it, do so. And if you didn't like it, then why are you reading this?<br/><br/>Bring on ""A Dame to Kill For""..."

Mickey Rourke is perfectly cast as Marv. Bruce Willis puts in an effortless performance as hartigan, but doesn't look like he's pushing 60 like it says. Elijah wood is brilliant as Kevin and is a truly chilling character without uttering a word throughout the film. and watch out for a little cameo role from the man frank miller himself. overall this movie is a modern classic as there is nothing else like it and it is only a 9 because i believe Benicio del Toro and Clive Owens performances were pretty bad."
"brenleyman","10","0","2","24 September 2005"," Sin City is a perfect adaptation of graphic novels and does a fabulous job of matching faces with characters
","It has been a while since I have seen a movie that made me think, ""God, I hope Hollywood doesn't lose it's luster."" Of course, Hollywood has been letting us down a lot recently. Sin City is a brilliant film, and has done a great job of adapting the graphic novels. The best part of the film, quality wise, is the casting. Mickey Rourke looks exactly like Marv from the novels, as does Clive Owen as Dwight. The characters are also well acted out, and the several scenes of comic-book style filming give the already comic book atmosphere a very good feel. There were parts of the film that reminded me of when I read spiderman when I was eight years old, and not much does that. The action is superb, with lots of gun fighting, hand to hand combat, and severely violent action that seems damn near impossible *spoiler-Hartigan ripping yellow bastards nuts off*. My favorite characters were Hartigan, Marv, and Dwight. Hartigan, portrayed by Bruce Willis (The Kid, The Sixth Sense) acts out the tortured mind of the detective trying to protect Nancy Callahan from Roark/Yellow Bastard. Marv, portrayed by Rourke, is in search of the people responsible for killing Goldie, a prostitute looking for protection. Dwight, played by Clive Owen, is trying to prevent the dissolving of a pact between the whores of Old Town, and the Basin City police. Besides great acting, excellent casting, great plot lines, and non-stop action, the only thing left is the film's atmosphere. Shot in black and white, with the occasional splash of color (SPOILER: Dwight's drive to the Pits)creates the excellent comic book feel that many book adaptation movies strive to attain. With all that said, Sin City is a great film with hardly anything wrong but a few sections of dialogue. I give Sin City a 10 out of 10, and I would recommend it to anyone who is strong enough to watch the scenes of violence that turn bloody."

","The very first feeling you have of this movie is that you have been cheated by its trailer to expect some kind of a noir action movie. The very next feeling is intense satisfaction that you were cheated. Because this is ""more"" noir. ""More"" action. ""More"" terror. ""More"" comic-style. And ""more"", ""more"", ""more"" dark. DARK. BLACK. And on the whole it's a brand new type of movie with no precedence but hopefully a lot of future. There can be no opposition to the fact that it's one of the most violent movies of all times. It pictures violence in a most realistic but nonetheless artistic style and its brutality generates a combination of feelings that under no circumstances can they be disgust or repulsion or apostrophe. So, it is most difficult to try and explain the sensation that overcomes you during this movie. Me, personally, I found myself really puzzled by the fact that what I was watching freaked me out and scared me to death while I really loved it all the same!! In each one of the film's separate stories, evil is at last defeated and good prevails. But things are not really that simple, because life is not that simple. The ""good"" guys are not boy scouts or angels but probably ex-prostitutes or ex-cons driven by revenge or even - not very politically correct - cops. And the bad guys could be kind of ""yellow bastards"" and man-eaters or they could just be corrupted millionaires and powerful men of the cloak. Hard reality mixed with pure sarcasm and allegory, inspiring direction, powerful performances, smart cartoon-creation, deep meaning and enjoyable outcome. A movie type on its own, this film is a real challenge for every true cinema- lover. Well Done!!!!!"

","I really don't know if it's a mistake from Rodriguez, who couldn't tell a story in right way, or pedant Frank Miller, bad screenwriter (for example: Robocop 2 and 3), who wants an adaptation word from a word and comics picture to a same movie picture, but effect is interesting experiment and mix of two medias --- in a wrong way... Sin City is so silly, so manner (and over hyped) and schizophrenic (colour of the blood), and what's important - not a noir or neonoir! Noir movies have cynical main character, voice-over which tells what happens in the twisted story, but never says, what character thinks in a way of Sin City, and game of light and shadow was was never accidental. Some actors overplay (Rourke, Rutger), ""underplay"" (Del Toro, Owen), was funny in emotional scene (Alba, Dawson), or just totally out (Wood and Madsen)... ""Sin City - City without oar live"", how somebody said, has last 5 minutes of the film which aren't from any of the Frank Miller's book, but that sequence destroys all the atmosphere with a Mobil phone and medical machines, and it's bad pointed and timed... Movie wasn't have a temp or even rhythm, just static camera and circus music, bloody scene are so over stylized it's funny (maybe it was be funny?), but Sin City isn't glorification of violence.

","Another Rodriguéz-Tarantino like figure<br/><br/>What could we expect from a Tarantino film? What could we expect from a Rodriguéz film? And better still, what could we expect from a Rodriguéz film in which Tarantino was a (very) special guest director? The answer is simple: a great film. These two men way of making movie was enhanced by Frank Miller, who also sat on the director's chair and made Sin City one of the most interesting film in the season. The idea is just brilliant  bring to the big screen the old graphic novel Sin City, made by Miller. When we see the film, we have the feeling we're reading a superhero HQ, due to the black and white images, the great photograph and even the dialogue and facial expressions of the characters, abnormal sometimes and not connected to the ones we see in cinema. The story happens in the fictitious city of Basin City (or just Sin City), that is a place full of criminals, prostitutes, drunk people and all kinds of anti-heroes. The police is just one of the authorities of the place, that is also ruled by ""The Girls"", a group of beautiful and sexy women who wear small pieces of clothes and use high-tech guns to protect themselves. Their leader is Gail (Rosario Dawson), who commands also Miho (Devon Aoki), a kind of lady samurai who can kill anyone in just a second. In this complex game there's also a new and mysterious third force that will disturb the respect the two other powers have between them. In this reign of crime live eccentric beings shown in three stories. One of them is Marv (Mickey Rourke), who falls in love with Goldie (Jaime King), a prostitute. The other type is Hartigan (Bruce Willis), a policeman who has many problems in his personal life, but has in Nancy (Jessica Alba), the reason to live. The last, but not least, is Jackie Boy (Benício del Toro), a man who tries to renew the relationship with his ex-girlfriend Shellie (Brittany Murphy), a waitress of a bar that is visited by all these people. Shellie, however is with Dwight (Clive Owen), who will not accept Jackie Boy's attempts to get closer to his girl."

","I must have dropped off the map for a while as I heard very little of this movie when it was out in theaters, anyway when it came out on DVD I rented it and wow was I surprised. It's totally badass, a guy guy movie to say the least. Great story with tons of Violence, Filled with beautiful woman with some good nude T&A scenes, and a likable cast of professional actors. I will be in the theaters for Sin City 2 for sure.<br/><br/>What amazed me most about this movie was the amount of violence they were able to show, I think it goes back to my blood theory, meaning that the more red blood they show, the harder it is for them to get the R rating (meaning to harsh for R). So this movie is filmed similar to Sky Captain in that most of the backgrounds are CGI while the characters are real. However the movie is filmed or converted I should say to mainly black and white, but color is added in certain situations for certain things, just to shake things up. In doing this they accomplished a few things. It kept a sort of 1920's kind of feel to the movie, yet it also made it scarier in a way which was good. Plus the big factor is that they could show a guy getting shot up or beat to hell in very graphic ways, but the blood would be in black in white or some other color than red in certain scenes, IMO this enabled them to get away with showing some graphic scenes and yet keep the R rating.<br/><br/>This movie blew me away from start to finish as I was intrigued and glued to my seat the whole time. It goes without saying that this is a hardcore action movie, so for those who don't like action or violence in heavy amounts, take a pass on this one. However for those who thrive off heavy action / gory movies like me, then this will be a treat for you! The movie is very comic book like containing heroes & villains who are all badass in their own way and who can take and dish out quite a bit of punishment. And yet it didn't come out trashy like 90% of all the marvel comic movies that come out. A real tribute to comic book like movies and action / gore movies If you haven't seen it yet and like Action / horror / thriller movies, rent it ASAP as it is awesome"

For most of them I only had to endure a trailer or a commented review on TV though...<br/><br/>And though I'm not a comic book fan, I know that Sin City differs from other comic franchises. It's black-and-white, it's ultimately dark, it has its own black humor and overall style.<br/><br/>Reluctantly I went to see Sin City on tape. The first scene suggested that the style from the paper version would be preserved. Subsequent credits indicated that Frank Miller had much to say and decide during the production. And next... from start to end one hell of a satisfying ride.<br/><br/>The flick has a noir style that is near to perfect. That may be the case of other comic adaptations as well (just cut ""noir"") but Sin City is supported even by the characters. Almost every single one of them has a believable personality - acting was surprisingly good for me.<br/><br/>Next thing is a fine combination of reckless violence and humor. It goes so well together in Sin City. I won't spoil anything though because I believe this movie deserves to be seen even if you are not into comic books in general.<br/><br/>Just go and watch deadly little Kevin and deadly little Miho, to name the few, in action."

"MT-15087","Null","0","1","7 September 2005"," ""A Darkness Is Here in the Nursery""
","There were feeble screen adaptations of comic books. There were quite ingenious ones, like, for example, Tim Burton's ""Batman"" movies. ""Sin City"" sticks somewhere in the middle. Unfortunately, with its nose definitely towards the option number one. There is a refrain in the movie declaring: ""In this City you can find anything"". Actually, it' s quite opposite to the truth - not a lot, in fact. And the main weakness here seems to be an obviously incongruous combination of the movie's sheer gruesomeness and its utterly superficial attitude.<br/><br/>The latter manifests itself in almost every element. The plot situations are insignificant. Had the characters happened to have at least some dimension they could have been considered cardboard. As it is they are transparent. While justified in a way - since the material derives from comic books, all this shallowness could have made a fit for another Rodriguez's endeavour in the area of entertainment for kids or some half-comedy like his ""From Dusk Till Dawn"". But it's hardly appropriate in the movie where every next minute someone dies having previously vomited a gallon of his own blood.<br/><br/>Some performances do not improve the situation either. Nancy Callahan, who is quite convincing in her incarnation as a child, instantly ceases to be so as soon as is transformed into her grown-up Jessica Alba version. Apparently, it's a full-time job to conjure a spark of something genuine out of this cute but totally inexpressive and utterly phoney, especially as it comes to anything sex related, starlet. It partially saves the day for her, but hardly for the viewer, that she happens to be accompanied most of the time by another unabashed paragon of creativity and invention - soon to become an Officer of the Order of Arts and Letters Mr. Willis. Who is customarily delivering his two and a half expressions of a badass with a heart of gold we have already seen on a zillion previous occasions. Other performances are pretty decent, including Mickey Rourke as Marv, who through a few pounds of make-up delivers another brick into his welcome comeback, and Elijah Wood as a sinister unblinking man-eater. But the actors are unable to drag the movie by themselves.<br/><br/>So, as a result, all this Rodriguez/Miller collaboration's infernal playground with all its pretentious ""darkness"" happens to be suspended in the void - in the wake of its unfortunate players. But if the creators didn't forget to supplement their performers with a CGI background, they have completely missed all the opportunities to add any substance to their work in all other respects. And in the end the viewer is left with just a series of visual attractions the degree of attractiveness of which is sometimes controversial.<br/><br/>In general, I would just say that to stick to such a superficial approach while making a movie for adult audiences is not good enough - of course, if we are not in the realm of pure visuals meant exclusively for such audiences, but it wasn't the case here, was it? Oh, yeah, talking about dirty pretty things - special thanks to Carla Gugino. Her nonchalant moonlit walk brings the only definite touch of allurement to this not highly compelling construction. I saw another review on this title summarized: ""An overrated movie, nobody will remember in a year"". In a year? Dude, you're being way too generous. Of course, apart from its inevitable sequel."

","It's way better than Spiderman, X-Men, Batman (although Michael Keaton did a decent job), etc. comic-book or graphic novels - (Kill Bill was based on ""The Bride"" and Pulp Fiction was loosely based on ""Battle Royale""). Kill Bill and Pulp Fiction are better films, but to me they seem based on chop-socky Asian or samurai (many of these are outstanding, much better than Pulp Fiction and Kill Bill).<br/><br/>One thing I like about Sin City is the European sense of timing - it takes its time developing a story - I wish it was longer. By far the most enjoyable story was Marv and Goldie, it was more personal than the other stories. Jaime King (Goldie/Wendy) and Mickey Rourke were so good and they connected, unlike Bruce Willis and Jessica Alba or Slive Owen and Rosario Dawson and Brittany Murphy. I really like the evil characters, like Bernicio Del Toro, Nick Stahl, Elijah Wood, Rutger Hauer, Powers Booth, and Michael Madsen.<br/><br/>Granted, the dialogue was kind of stilted - but hey, it's not Shakespeare, Tom Stoppard, Sam Shepherd, David Mamet, etc. But the dialogue echoes the film noir classics in the Thirties, Forties, and Fifties.<br/><br/>The set design and the whole look of this film was great - it rivals Berlin (Terry Gilliam), Metropolis (Fritz Lang silent), Battleship Potemkin and Aleksandr Nevsky (Eisenstein), The Godfather I and II (Scorsese), La Femme Nikita (Luc Besson), etc."
"Iannni","8","0","1","5 September 2005"," Visually Astounding
","I expected Sin City to be great before anyone even knew what it was. The movie contains three separate stories and one 5 minute one done by the master himself, Frank Miller. Not only does this film feature an amazing cast some of witch are, the master of action, Bruce Willis, The new babe, Jessica Alba, the hard ass, Mickey Rourke, and the Hobbit, Elijah Wood, but it also features two of my favorite directors and the masters of blood and gore Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino, and Frank Miller just making sure no one screws with his baby.<br/><br/>The one thing in this picture that stands out the most is background. We have all seen Schindler's List and have seen the transition of color in black and white. But you will never experience it like you do in the film. The movie is black and white but almost not black and white. Filming the entire film on a green board and punching in the background later, Rodriguez uses the troublemaker studios to make a back round that is completely computer generated and yet somehow makes it look as tho it is a page from frank miller's graphic novels. Perfecting this caption, unlike sky caption did, Rodriguez also uses color to express certain parts of the movie. a happy moment and somehow color sneaks into the background. A cop tailing a car and the red and blue lights flash inside the car. He truly perfects this unique aspect in this film.<br/><br/>The movie starts in the segment ""the Hard Goodbye"" The First in the Frank Miller's Sin City series. It is a interesting story of revenge and...well...just sick people. Mickey Rourke Makes his comeback in this movie playing a hard ass gladiator out to get 'em. His performance is truly astounding and hilarious at parts. This segment is my personal favorite in this film.<br/><br/>The second segment is called ""the Big Fat Kill"". This stars Clive Owen ,Benicio Del Toro ,and Brittany Murphy in a plot that involves obviously killing and hookers(every mans dream). It features some interesting plot twists (tho some are quite predictable). The acting in this part is sort of corny and over dramatic with a little bad dialog (tho i'm sure intensional). HOWEVER before i get you thinking badly it probably has the best story out of the three. This is my least favorite out of the three.<br/><br/>The final Segment is ""That Yellow Bastard"". This segment stars Bruce Willis, Jessica Alba, and Nick Stahl. Now this story on the other hand has great acting by all and good dialog. The story is a great romance tho a little strange of a romance. Very bloody (what a surprise ;)).<br/><br/>Overall this is the best movie i have ever seen visually and probably the most bloody. With many twist and turns and the unique three stories this movie was great but could have been astounding if it weren't for the acting and dialog. I know it was done that way on purpose but i still think that the actors could have done better with the exception of Mickey Rourke. But if Frank Miller ever reads this... i love you man, you are truly my hero and one of the best story writers in my book but man...don't take this personally and you REALLY need to in prove on your dilate. Love you man peace out..."

","I must admit that I know, or knew rather, very little about the story or history of Frank Miller and his series of comic book novels - and maybe that is why I enjoyed this movie so much. Although, this is still a different type of situation where one who was a big fan of the stories might be seriously critical of every little detail of the comic book turned movie. I don't believe anyone who considers themselves truly knowledgeable about Miller's work can say that this was not represented well on the big screen. I'm now intrigued to go back and check out some of his work.<br/><br/>That aside, as far as it being a movie and a work of art, I would give this movie high marks in both categories. For it being a movie, it was nice to see something so different as far as the approach to making it go. Also, having such an incredible cast makes it all the more intriguing. I don't see anyone else having portrayed any of these characters any better than the cast that was hired to do so."
"yevonwm","6","0","2","30 August 2005"," A Bad Film
","This film is really depressing - How can you take so many good actors and so much time spent editing to such a unique style yet generate something that is boring. I'm going to write off the apparently bad acting as an attempt at being consistent with the style of the novels. This film consists of a series of short stories that vaguely interlink, some better than others. The story featuring bruce willis is unfortunately boring and really slams him as an actor. The story to follow that is quite exciting and the next one isn't too bad although i zoned out during the middle. Then it returns to the willis boredom-fest - at this point i walked out on the movie (and I usually really feel a need to finish a movie i go to see). This sort of anime-style cartoony film noir stuff is tough going and the movie is pretty gory, which is a good thing and saves the movie for short periods, an obvious influence of Tarantino. The style is an obvious copy of shindlers list and an attempt to put the batman & general marvel style comics to the screen. Overall - an incredibly over-rated movie thats worth a watch if you're doing so for free but the film wont be remembered in a years time."

","Stylish !! OK understood that it is a needed attribute for all good quality films, now. But Over Stylish shall be the estimation for any audience who haven't read the Frank Miller's Comic Book.<br/><br/>This Film at visuals is just like or little better than ""Dick Tracy"". Of course it has altogether different taste. Sin City is that Evil Violent City in which dwells the small town with exotic women prostitutes & mobsters. Our Characters & Heroes are sort of Hidden Natural Born killers and probably the only one who retain some respect for their own gorgeous women.<br/><br/>Sin City covers the fabulous touch of a fast-paced Story shot in Black & White & with a Comic style of outlook governed by good special effects & art direction. Each story has a hero out to protect the women from evil villains or avenging some kind of atrocities made on women.<br/><br/>But the film makers never considered that a Hollywood production is a venture for global distribution. Not even one percent of the global audience must've read the comic book. And what happens is the Hero gets shot with a machine gun and he lives. He is shot again & again, but he lives. He is shot on the chest with more than 10 bullets but he lives!!! The Hero jumps from the 4th or the 5th floor on the ground & he lives !! Why didn't the film makers make a Carton then. The Film is definitely not made for children as Sin City series of comic books are only for Adult reading. Then out of how many Hollywood movie goer adults are immature enough to relish this sort of comic fantasy on screen? The Movie then gets a touch from Kill Bill sort of sword action sequences which are of course scene stealers & greatly executed. Quinten Tarantino must have just added a value out of this comic sense of mess.<br/><br/>The film's best part was the Babes. The hot & the hottest babes. Jessica Alba, Rosario Dawson, Devon Aoki, Jaime King & others sets the screen on fire. The touch of romance between these hot babes & their counter part heroes is splendid.<br/><br/>Full marks to Cinematography. Mickey Rourke is excellent & deserves applaud for his great act. Finally the Film only belongs to Bruce Willis. Just after when the 2 prime story ends & we thought that we shall not see Willis again, comes the continuation of the 3rd story. Bruce Willis' screen presence saves us from all sort of disappointments."
"mirandasp","Null","0","1","29 August 2005"," A visual feast
","...whose content may cause indigestion.<br/><br/>This is a must-see for cinematography fans, unique (as far as I know) because it successfully attempts to replicate the look and emotional feel of a graphic novel/comic. Rendered in high-contrast black and white with splashes of vivid color (here bright red lips, there a vivid blue eye, and for the last third, here a sickeningly yellow villain), every shot is highly designed and stylized. I couldn't take my eyes off of this film. <br/><br/>Though I wanted to! Sin City is not for the faint of heart, as it is one of the most graphically violent films you'll ever see, tempered only by the dark humor inherent in something so extreme. It doesn't surprise me that Quentin Tarantino was involved in this, because it has that over-the-top, ultra-gory, did-they-actually-just-show-that element (severed heads, anyone?) <br/><br/>That goes for the acting, too: Just about everyone does a fine job --Mickey Rourke in particular. Their voice-overs and on-screen performances expertly render that Film Noir tone, with just the right balance of earnestness and irony. Also, Elijah Wood and Alexis Bledel succeed in their attempts to change their ""nice"" image.<br/><br/>As a woman, I have to mention that this film (and presumably the graphic novels on which it's based) adhere strictly to gender stereotypes. All the men are tough and testosterone-charged, and all the women are whores, or whores with hearts of gold. There is one noble ""dyke"" who nevertheless parades around gratuitously naked. But I could forgive this, because the characters are really just archetypes in service of the multi-part plot. <br/><br/>If you get the DVD, it's worth checking out the ""making of"" feature -- interesting to see how they actually shot it."
"Thunderbuck","8","0","1","27 August 2005"," Great? Possibly. Fun? Not so much...
","SIN CITY gets a good solid 8/10 from me. It's a huge, over-the-top miasma of gore and sex (though mostly gore, really). And no film has so faithfully rendered the feel of a comic book.<br/><br/>Visually, the film is utterly brilliant. Mostly black and white, with odd (and frequently disturbing) splotches of color bring a compelling look to a story that relies on film noir conventions mostly without irony.<br/><br/>There are some unfortunate weaknesses to this film, though. The unremitting grimness of the various characters gets a little wearisome by the halfway point. The rich, heavy atmosphere that Robert Rodriguez has constructed here gets a little TOO heavy at times. Constructed as a series of loosely-related subplots, some stories are better than others. The middle of this film is taken up with a subplot (featuring Benicio Del Toro and Clive Owen) that was probably intended to provide some comic relief, and really just kind of goes off the rails. And, I'm sorry to say, Jessica Alba turns out to be sorely miscast when the story finally turns its attention to her.<br/><br/>But where SIN CITY DOES work, it works remarkably well. The story of man-monster Marv and his attempt to avenge the death of his beloved Goldie is compelling, even moving. Is it over the top? Sure, but so is opera. And Mickey Rourke's Marv is probably the best, most convincing character in the film. And the story of Bruce Willis' Hartigan and his attempt to save an 11 year old girl from a sadistic rapist works, mostly.<br/><br/>This is not a fun movie. Women are (badly) mistreated, though I'll say it's in the service of the story. The violence is pervasive, graphic, and at times disgustingly original. Part of what I admire about SIN CITY is Robert Rodriguiz' commitment to bring to the screen such a lurid, politically incorrect story in these times of resurging conservatism."

I rented it because of all of the stars who appear in it and I had read the reviews which were all good. This movie was awesome. Its not like watching a movie at all. There is a lot of gory scenes, but they are done so creatively, you don't really get grossed out. The stories are woven together and unfold slowly, so you can take it all in.I enjoyed all of the actors. My favorite was definitely Mickey Rourke. He was great. I'm a huge Bruce Willis fan, and I think Clive Davis is HOT! Elijah Woods does a very good job as a weird-o killer. There's a lot of other actors you will enjoy too. The women are good, but it seems that the men make the movie what it is. There is one woman, and I forget her name, that is the coolest woman in the movie. She never says a word throughout the whole movie, but you will know who I'm talking about as soon as you watch it. She has a great part! I didn't care much for Alexis Bledel in her part. I can't see her as a prostitute and to me she didn't sell her part. Sorry. I won't name all of the names, but it is definitely packed with stars!

"dark_creation_11","10","0","1","21 August 2005"," An incredible feat in film-making
","""Sin City"" is, without question, one of the finest achievements in cinematic art in recent times. It stays completely faithful to the original graphic novels without sacrificing cinematic effect. In an era when ""comic-book flicks"" are becoming the big summer movie blockbusters and it seems all one must do is make the film and it rakes in the cash, we have a movie that's impact is deeper than great special effects and the Good v.s. Evil archetype.<br/><br/>Granted, said special effects are amazingly effective. Though grand and exaggerated, it feels real. At no point do you find yourself saying ""Okay, that's just too much, there is no way that happens"". After watching overly-elaborate light saber duels in ""Revenge of the Sith"" and lackluster action sequences from ""Fantastic Four"", the simple yet brilliant action sequences in ""Sin City"" are very refreshing.<br/><br/>And the characters, my god. Though the narrative is strikingly eloquent throughout, each character uses it differently. For instance, Marv (Played BRILLIANTLY by Mickey Rourke) uses the narrative in such a way it makes you forget that your are watching a sadistic slayer of men who seems to value human life no more than a piece of garbage rather than the brooding, good-hearted giant you find yourself rooting for, in essence, Marv is everything the dark parts of us wish we could be. In contrast, Clive Owen's Dwight uses the narrative to paint a brilliant picture of the under workings of of the dark parts of the world. You feel every insane, high tension spark that Dwight feels.<br/><br/>The criticisms one hears of ""Sin City"" are mostly the same you would hear about ""Pulp Fiction"" or any other Tarentino film, namely abrasive violence and monotonous characters, to which I would reply with a firm: WHAT?! Granted, I will not deny that Sin City is a violent film. It is a very violent film, but the stylistic manner in which most of it is portrayed, one only flinches at the more horribly violent ideas and the truly gory portions of the film are few and far between. Indeed, Sin City is victimized by the same hysteria that labeled ""Pulp Fiction"" and ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" as terribly violent and gory films, despite minimal blood and on-scene mutilation. Much of the gore is implied, though the violence is on full display. In the case of the ""character monotony"", I would argue that this is film about ""seedy"" characters, and as such, we characterize all of them as the same. Between Marv's Confused Psycho, Dwight's Collected Murdering Meddler, and Hartigan's Straight Arrow Cop who understands that in that city, the straight and narrow path often leads to failure, we see a collage of dark characters who are most different in where they are similar: They all see violence as necessary, but each of them uses it from a different perspective.<br/><br/>In the end, ""Sin City"" will have its fans and its detractors, as do many of the Quote-unquote ""Cult"" hits such as ""Resevoir Dogs"" and ""Pulp Fiction"", but one cannot deny that ""Sin City"" uses the lack of restraint of violence only to paint a greater picture with the beautiful narrative, stunning imagery, and beautiful noir atmosphere that makes ""Sin City"" stand out among the great cult films of our time.<br/><br/>Walk down the right back alley in Sin City, and you can find anything..."
"ryan_kuhn","8","0","1","21 August 2005"," ""Tell anybody the truth and they're dead!""
","Robert Rodriguez is an ambitious filmmaker. He's done an old west trilogy, he's done 3-D kids movies, but his crowning achievement thus far is Sin City. Not just story wise, but visually and technically, Sin City is a triumph. The glossy, rich look that this movie possesses is something to behold. The use of black and white gives depth to the story and lush look that will not doubt be copied in the future. Most of Sin City was done in front of green screens with the backgrounds added later, much like Sky Captain was, and the transition to finished product is wonderful to see. Based on the graphic novels, as in illustrated comic books but could also apply to the very adult content of the stories, by Frank Miller, Sin City translates three of Miller's stories into the film, held loosely together by a running storyline. The stories pretty much follow a standard formula: an unlikely hero gets in disturbing trouble and they have to fight their way out of it. Greed and power are overlying themes throughout Sin City, often ending with violent results. Bruce Willis plays a detective with a bum ticker, Jessica Alba plays a stripper, Rosario Dawson plays a commando hooker, Brittany Murphy plays a waitress, Mickey Rourke plays an ex-con who is on a mission for survival, Clive Owen and Benecio Del Toro play opposite each other for one storyline, and Elijah Wood plays the most disturbing character in the movie, the mute Kevin. This is only a partial list, it's a fun game to watch Sin City and try to figure out where you've seen each actor on the screen before. Rodriguez shares the directing credits with Frank Miller, as the movie takes it visual style straight from his books, and Quentin Tarantino, who directed one scene. The movie bogs down in it's length, as three of Miller's stories are condensed into this two hour movie. This lead to some confusion on which character was which and why they were doing the things they were doing. The movie would have benefited from disposing of one of the three stories and saving it for the inevitable sequel. The stunning visuals however overcomes any qualms I had with the plot. The violent nature of the movie will detract some viewers, and that's OK. This movie was not made with the casual viewer in mind. Sin City is best viewed when the viewer is prepared for horrifying violence and beautiful black and white photography."

","Amazing visuals! The high contrast b&w with bits of color used in all the right places made this film a real treat to look at. The voice-over's were also amazing. Especially the voice of Marv played by Mickey Rourke. You need a sub-woofer to get the full effect of Marv!! The special effects spectacular! The exaggerated sound effects during the fight scenes were startling. If you didn't see this film in the theater or even if you did, I highly recommend experiencing it on a big screen TV capable of 480p or better and a DTS receiver complete with surround speakers and a sub-woofer with lots of watts.<br/><br/>I thoroughly enjoyed this film. It brought the pages of Frank Miller's graphic novels to life in the most spectacular way. I've never seen specials effects like this, ever. Of all graphic novels turned movie, this is by far the best to date in my opinion. I totally agree with the directors that Mickey Rourke seemed to be born for this part. It's hard to imagine anyone else playing the part of Marv. He is one bad M.F.!! I can't wait to see the sequels scheduled for 2006 & 2008.<br/><br/>If you enjoy this genre, it's THE must see of all of the must see films. It's truly a masterpiece."

They really created a surrealistic world of super macho men and vivacious ballsy woman, wow I really liked the woman, everyone of them were beautiful and had great dialog, the experience was like living in the comic book world of Frank Miller and he wrote you into the movie, like a fly on the wall.

","SIN CITY<br/><br/>Frank Miller holding the credits for the story and co-direction for the movie actually is graphic novel ( a rather more honored term for comic books ) writer since past 20 years or so. His novels portray characters in black and white with some splashes of color on the paper. The movie SIN CITY is actually an adaptation of three of such novels/comic book by Miller , namely ""The Hard Goodbye"" Marv-Mickey Rourkey and Goldie's-Jamie King story, ""The Big Fat Kill"" ,Dwight-Clive Owen and other ladies, and ""That Yellow Bastard"", Hardigan-Bruce Willis and Nancy's-Jessica Alba story).<br/><br/>the movie has just brought together these three stories together , all three having no relevance with each other only for the BAR scene where three heroes of the three separate stories come to have a drink . Marv comes there to have a drink after he runs from the police, hardigan comes there in search of Nancy and Dwight is there just to have a drink n meet Shelly . otherwise the movie goes separately for the three stories.<br/><br/>however in these stories each hero has a severe problem and he has to fight both his personal problem and attain his objective of killing others. in case of Bruce Willis , it was his heart , which pounds and pains when he is in excitement or whenever he has a rush of adrenalin in his veins. he has to overcome his age problem and fight with the fat yellow bastard. Marv or mickey Rourke has a problem with reality , he sometimes fails to understand whether whatever happening with him is real or it is just his dream, he can't make decision whether he should kill people or not because he is not able to judge if the reason for which he is killing people is genuine or just dream generated , if its not real then his acts will eventually make him a psycho killer going and killing people for no good reason . he fights his problem and tries to overcome them throughout the movie . Clive oven / Dwight on the other hand has a grotesque feeling that he can talk to corpses , what actually happens is he is so afraid of dead bodies that he himself talks to himself , a case of portraying himself as a talking corpse.<br/><br/>The entertainment ability of the movie lies in the direction and screenplay of the movie , how it has been adapted from a B/W paper work to a 32mm projection material. If you might have noticed,throughout the movie no object in the background is in the motion , its only the characters and the objects they are involved with , not even a single leaf moves in the whole movie . this is because the whole movie was done indoor and the background implanted using the technology after wards. the movie has been directed so that it seems it is an adaptation of a comic book , the action used in the movie is cartoon style , people flying on explosions or car hits etc. the whole movie has been kept B/W and only some object have been shown in color just it is in the case with the comic book.<br/><br/>the whole movie is cold,violent,raw,rough and grotesque, the way nowadays US guys enjoy the entertainment to be. a proof of the fact is huge number of fans of the movies like PULP FICTION, NATURAL BORN KILLERS, KILL BILL etc. this new revolution in the movie making can be attributed to Tarantino , whose PULP FICTION came to be a great hit in US.he was invited as a guest director in the movie as well , where he directed the scene where Goldie's sister rushes the car over Marv.<br/><br/>direction and screenplay wise movie is good . people seem to enjoy such movies nowadays , its ranking of 91 on IMDb says a lot about that."

Admittedly, there's nothing wrong in doing this in a literary device that has been used for ages in books and short stories, but it seemed to me a bit out of place in the film context.<br/><br/>Probably the highpoint of the stories was the Marv story, with a vengeance tale that just kept going.

","You can't blame a movie for being close to the original, can you? Having read most of the Sin City comic books just recently, I sometimes thought that some of the most disturbing portrayals of extreme violence and bloodshed should have been left out in the movie. It is something different if you have a black and white panel in a comic book or if you have moving pictures which make the experience much more alive.<br/><br/>Still, apart from the blood and gore criticism, the film is a very exact rendition of what the comics are about. Harldy ever has any form of book been transferred to the big screen in such an unbiased form - certainly due to Frank Miller being the co-director of the movie.<br/><br/>The movie is fast-paced, the characters are strong and the visual adaption of the comic is breath taking. If you close your eyes during some of the most violent scenes, you have a perfect example of a comic book movie here.<br/><br/>Still, I thought that some of the elements left out in the Hardigan storyline were diminishing the personal drama the character is going through. Maybe it would have been better to show these elements - scenes in which Hardigan talks to his wife or is confronted with Senator Roark in court - and to leave out one or two severed limbs instead?"

Dwight enacts revenge but realizes to late what may just set off a war between the cops of New Town and the prostitutes of Old Town. <br/><br/>The three stories intermingle a bit and are all narrated by the three lead characters. The cast presented is one of the best I've ever seen and each actor is able to bring their own character to life. The story does not drag once as the film expands two hours. Some scenes are a bit nauseating and others, heart-touching.<br/><br/>The film is almost entirely in black and white except for some beautifully shot scenes using colors to emphasize emotion and/ or personality. This is one of the most stunning films I've ever seen. It's bold, it's fresh, and above all else, dark.<br/><br/>Sin City. Starring: Clive Owen, Bruce Willis, Mickey Rourke, Benicio Del Toro, Elijah Wood, and Rosario Dawson.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 Stars."

","Sin City is a very cool movie. There is no way to describe it as anything other than cool. While not being on par with such movies as Apocolyse Now, it was a thoroughly enjoyable experience watching this movie. I wish I had seen it in theaters, as the movie included shots that could have been grand on the big screen.<br/><br/>The movie follows four stories, which are shocking, brutal, nubile, gory, and humorous. My personal favorite is the story of Marv, who seeks revenge after his love Goldie is murdered. Marv(Mickey Rourke) is a tough, ugly bruiser who can take quite a beating. It is well acted, and the shots come straight out of a comic book. The other stories are equally good, with an old cop(Bruce Willis), prostitutes galore, and a smelly yellow bastard.<br/><br/>Also starring Elijah Wood as a creepy serial killer, Benicio del Toro as a jerk who thinks he's the boyfriend of a seedy waitress, played by Brittany Murphy, and Clive Owen as Dwight, a murderer with a new face. They all do superb acting jobs.<br/><br/>My final score: 10/10 for enjoyability."

","I thought about Sin City a bit...and realized how chauvinistic it is. All three male characters' motives are to save some damsels in distress--Willis saves Alba, Owen saves the Old Town girls, and Rourke saves(helps) Wendy. Even the seemingly strong female character needs rescuing(Rosario Dawson). The only exception to this is Miho, the Japanese assassin, but she's not the brains behind the operation; Clive Owen is. Other than that, I think the movie's concept is OK--in a city choke-full of sin, the good guys divert their energy into saving their perception of goodness--which is women, apparently.<br/><br/>Of course, the intended audience of the movie are 20-something males, and the movie/comic book plays to feed their interests of violence, underdogs, and women. So I can't say I expect anything else in the contents. But I wouldn't want it any other way. The product came out well.<br/><br/>Another thing--the format of the movie is more along the lines of a comic book, rather than a movie. Due to that, the pacing of the movie was a bit lagging.<br/><br/>But the awesomeness of the way the comic book visuals were translated into film blows away most of the doubts I have about this movie. It is absolutely gorgeous. The black and white, with red splashes and shocks of yellow are so striking, so well-shot, that I can't say enough good things about it.<br/><br/>A couple of other highlights of the film--the soundtrack was quite unique. It went well with the movie. Also, Elijah Wood is beautifully creepy as the cannibal version of Charlie Brown.<br/><br/>Sin City is not flawless--but the originality with which this film was produced and directed just lifts this film high above most other films I'm seeing these days."

","First I have to say that Sin City was my most wanted ever since the first teaser appeared. I was so inspired by this mixture of a real movie and comic that I watched every single trailer or whatever I could get ;). So finally the movie released and I could find out if my expectations would be fulfilled. First I have to say that it's a very violent movie and in some scenes a bit to explicit, even for me. However, this was known from reviews before and so you could avoid going in the movie if you don't like such stuff. Another thing which was known was the unusual comic-style. In one word: AMAZING. It fits perfectly to this evil city and the dark characters. Also the colored patches where perfectly made so that they fit in the movie. The movie itself contains three parts from which all have different characters. First is Marv, the coolest character ever in a movie. He doesn't know what pain means and so he does everything to get revenge for his dead girlfriend Goldie. That leaves a track of devastation and corpses behind. Next one is Dwight. He helps the ""girls"" of Sin City to hush up a murder which endangers the armistice between them and the police. The last one is Hartigan, a retired cop who tries to save a girl from a psycho. Every episode is a masterpiece for itself. They are all darkly and every character shows his bad sides, so nobody has a white waistcoat in the end. It's not about heroes but about people who fight for their conviction."
"Ruxskull","8","0","1","18 August 2005"," A comic book, not a movie
","I really like the movie, but it is a comic book. That is not a bad thing, and it has been brilliantly done. But it is not a movie.<br/><br/>Remember when The Superman Movie came out? ""you'll believe a man can fly"". That's the premise of a movie, movement/action/sound. The action in SIN CITY is mostly a transition from the comic book panels. Brilliantly done, but it is not a separate vision from the comic book, it is a reproduction of the comic book.<br/><br/>Those that have called this the best comic to movie venture ever are correct, if you want a complete remake of the comic. But shouldn't a movie be something different? Shouldn't film take advantage of its medium over that of a comic book? <br/><br/>The editing in SIN CITY is exceptional, but only in recreating the feel and experience of reading the comic. This then again, is not a bad thing, and I really enjoyed the movie, but it was not a different experience from the Comic. The characters did look like actual humans rather than the comic figures they are, and the casting and look of them was great.<br/><br/>The action though, the essential element a movie has over other medium, seemed to be the challenge to the film makers. How to transpose the still life frame of a comic to the thousands of frames of perceptually continuous movement of a movie? Well, they did it.<br/><br/>Even the most intense actions films had a deliberate stop and go edit to them that created a nearly seamless transition of moving from panel to panel in a graphic comic book. The movie is unique in its success in creating this effect and from a technical achievement deserves accolades.<br/><br/>But for me, the attraction of comics to film is to see a different representation of the characters, plot, genre and theme of the comics, while taking advantage of the medium. This is the same reason comic readers enjoy reading comics written and drawn by different people.<br/><br/>Each keeps the source material, but add a personal view into the soul of the characters and their world. The movies of Spiderman (especially #2) and Batman Begins have done this best, while Unbreakable did it from a completely different perspective (building tension though pacing-a film technique). These movies bring the characters and their world to film and let us experience them in a film, not as a panel by panel remake of an existing comic.<br/><br/>Enjoy the movie for what it is. A good movie brilliantly recreating an exceptional comic book. Not a great film using source material from another medium."

","I found this movie to be one of my favorites of 2005 no wait that doesn't quite give it justice, how about one of my favorites EVER! This movie has a storyline that just keeps you in, with lots of great action scenes to keep you at the edge of your seat. I just can't wait until the next movies come out so i can indulge in Miller and Rodriguez's tasty eye candy again. The visuals in this movie are so beautiful, every shot looks as though it is a beautiful artwork. I absolutely fell in love with the unique style that the directors brought to it which made it much more thrilling to watch.<br/><br/>I liked all the characters as well, all with their own missions and values and were on average acted well by cast members. I thought Mickey Rourke did a brilliant job of Marv. which made that segment of story highly enjoyable. Having never read Frank Millers graphic novels gave me nothing to compare the movie to, to look at possible faults but it certainly had made me feel bad for not having read the graphic novels yet, which i will begin to do quite soon.<br/><br/>So I highly recommend this film, and say to those who have not yet seen it, what are you waiting for get out there and watch it now!"
"Arturo_Lugo","9","0","1","18 August 2005"," A film noir for a whole new generation
","While Robert Rodriguez' work has not been much of an art form really, Sin City stands out not only as his best film to date, but also the must-see of 2005 and the most rebel commercial release since Quentin Tarantino's Pulp Fiction. This is truly the most faithful transcription of a graphic novel to the big screen.<br/><br/>Now, Rodriguez was really lucky to have the creator of the original material on-board for the project, Frank Miller, credited also as a Director (which had Roodriguez signed out of the Director's Guild of America) because it definitively would not have been the film it is without him. The cast is amazing, and also resemble the comic cast of characters incredibly well, with Mickey Rourke taking the silver screen by storm, and Benicio del Toro, Bruce Willis, and Clive Owen performing incredibly good. Also is worth noting Elijah Wood, really well directed and in a role that will take that Frodo character out of your head.<br/><br/>As you probably know, the movie is comprised out of three Sin City comic books: The Hard Goodbye (1), The Big fat kill (3) and That Yellow Bastard (4) with little bit of A Dame to Kill For (2). If you have read the comics, you'll be amazed of how it translated so faithfully to the screen. If you haven't you'll want to read them as soon as you finish the movie. According to the director, there's a Special Edition coming in December/05 that has some really neat stuff, including all three stories separated and viewable as individual pieces. So you should check it out. This movie is not only worth watching: it's gonna influence cinema in ways Rodriguez never imagined. Once you go to Sin City, you'll never want to leave."

","Sin City I thought was a pretty good action flick. It had awesome cinema-tics and the cast was amazingly well known. I normally don't like the kind of movies that jump back and forth but this is an exception like Pulp Fiction or Kill . However there were some pretty weird and gross scenes in it like the part when Miho chopped all the gangsters into chop liver. But the best part was when Benecio Del Toro, after being cut up, starts to talk to Dwight while driving the old car. But the reason I don't give it a 10 is because of the Goldie story, I was a little confused on some parts there. But overall, I think I'd buy this one.

","Not having read the comics I don't know what may be otherwise well known, but here goes: What is the meaning of the first and final segments? The hit-man has no other bearing in the movie. He seems to be another story that will/might be developed in a sequel. Or...<br/><br/>All the stories (including first and last) carry one leitmotif: Roark. There are time/place coincidences in the three main stories (Hartigan goes to find Nancy in the same bar where Marv is, When Marv arrives to at the house where Kevin is, he hears someone hitting someone else in the top floor: that later turns out to be Roark Jr. lashing Nancy, etc). But in the first and last stories, there is no such coincidence. What seems to connect them to the other three is the underlying evil in Sin City. As a Senator/Cardinal/Degenerate, Roark is the personification of that evil power in Sin City and (probably) also whoever hired the assassin both times.<br/><br/>Do the comics clear this up or do they also have -on purpose- loose ends like this one?"

Well, having a sick sense of humor meant I was laughing in the most inappropriate places.<br/><br/>Devon Aoki and Elijah Wood were outstanding considering neither spoke a single word throughout the film as Miho and Kevin respectively. Most of Mickey Rourke's acting had to be done through his eyes due to the amount of makeup he had on, that impressed me considering I'm not a big Mickey Rourke fan. Clive Owen, Bruce Willis and Rosario Dawson always rock in what ever roles they take on. In Rosario Dawson case though, it was treat to see her as tough as nails Gail. Benicio Del Toro, what can I say. He makes being a thug look real appealing.<br/><br/>Jessica Alba however, was a disappointment.

","I initially didn't think I was going to like this. I knew it was a series of fairly unconnected stories, and the first two seemed to occupy about five minutes each. I thought the whole movie would carry on that way, and if so it would have been a disjointed mess. Fortunately it settles down quickly - and later on it returns to the little bits and develops them fully to boot.<br/><br/>Overall, I loved it. It's got a very weird visual style, over the top characters, gritty as all hell plots. Don't look for heroes in this movie - there are none. Sin City is a place where everybody gouges everybody else every chance they get, because it's the only way you get even a slim chance to stay alive. If there was a real city like this, no sane person would go within a hundred miles of it - but it's the kind of place that sucks people in and traps them there even as it breaks them down.<br/><br/>It all falls apart if you stop to think about it, but you don't stop to think about it so that's not a problem.

Though I have generally enjoyed most entries into this genre, I have to say that few have really tried to push the boundaries of cinema.<br/><br/>With Sin City, based on Frank Miller's graphic novel's, we have given something stylistically different to anything before it, a dark as anything 50's world were nothing is right, and the 'heroes' are always severely flawed in some way.<br/><br/>I personally loved everything about it. The look of the film, almost entirely made up in digital, creates an atmosphere unlike anything you will see in other films. The dialog, though certainly not 'mainstream', offers a great throwback to another time when one-liner's and narrative's were king. The characters, many of whom you will love, would be despicable in another world, but here they are as unique as the world miller has created, and are made to be cared about.<br/><br/>Despite some claims that it moves at lightning pace, there are times when it is slow up a bit. It cannot be understated that the film is incredibly gruesome in parts as well, though not overly gratuitous in it's attack on the senses.

Though one of the main attractions of this masterpiece is it's digital process, the three stories (excluding ""The Customer is Always Right) are, if not disturbing, excellent and humorous. There is a scent of Tarantino in this, yes, he did direct a scene in this, but the words from the comics, and things that happen, are very Tarantino.<br/><br/>Why are we attracted to the darkness of life? Murder; crime, sex...we are attracted to it because these things happen in real life. Though it may be very fantasized, a prostitute that sleeps with a muscle builder could be killed by a cannibal.

See this immediately; fall in love with every character, whether they be good or bad; applaud how the actors act (which is very well); and be amazed at how it is directed, and how it looks. Be ready for one of the best films ever created. Be ready for Sin City."

","One of the most shocking, and most intense, thrilling shocker movies, ever made, Sin City does it all, with it's action, and noir like stories in the fictional city, which is full of crime, murder, scandal, prostitutes, corrupt officials, politicians, gun toting, sword wielding women, and a lot of other depraved sickos, and you get to hear each person's side of the story, of the situations of what's on and what's happening in Basin City, especially what's happening in the outskirts of the city, especially the one in the farm, which seems to reminisce the murders of Ed Gynne, and Elijah Wood's character was kick ass! Each scene features black in white, mixed with color in some scenes, with red in the cars, and the blood, though some of the blood is white, perhaps for legal reasons, and also in one of the segments, there is color, and the cars also get different colors. Robert Rodriguez did such a good job in making this adaption onto the big screen, with the help of Quentin Tarantion of Kill Bill/Pulp Fiction/Reservoir Dogs fame! I must admit, this surpasses both Kill Bill and Pulp Fiction in terms of plot, and action. Recommended to all who enjoy Rodriguez's films and action films, especially violent ones, and to the fans of the original comics, and I heard there is a sequel in the works, and I feel overwhelmed with joy, hoping it will be as good."

","wow!!! firstly i had a real high expectation for this film being that members of my family were huge sin city fans. spent many days checking the cast details and which stories they would include. three things struck a chord.... mickey Rourke as Marv, the former boxer wasn't exactly my first choice as Marv, especially after his role in once upon a time in Mexico(stupid dog). Elijah wood as Kevin, i just couldn't see past the hobbit, shallow i know. but i still remember the faculty. his speciality is nerdy! lastly the point that the film would be made mostly cgi, now i'm a fan of special effects as much as the next person but too much makes films look like a Sega genesis game. streets of rage instead of sin city. <br/><br/>many of you reading this think I'm now bashing the film but what I'm trying to say is that i was so....WRONG!!!! Mickey Rourke is MARV!!!! without a doubt there is no person on this Earth that could have done a better job. Elijah wood was just creepy and good on him, the noir effect on his glasses was divine. and finally the cgi aspect was astounding. Robert did a great job, one for frank miller and his fans to be proud of. in case you haven't seen it, I'm recommending it to all, comic book fans, actions fans...everyone!!!!"

","I saw this piece yesterday at the cinema, and I have to make clear to everyone that I have never been especially into comics by Frank Miller. I guess I have never really give it a fair chance. Anyhow, the piece totally stunned me. I love that the movie is generally in B&W except for some Technicoloreffects, and that really puts a neat ""comic feel"" to it. I guess the editors captured the feeling of being exposed to a comic, as the whole piece really did feel like a comic, at times reminding me of the movie scenes in the PC game ""Max Payne"". I think that the story is told in a superb way, and the actors (impressive cast!) don't really surprise us, as we already now what these actors are capable of. See this today, you won't regret it! 8/10!"

","Sin city is gritty, dark and well dark. You have to be a certain type of person to like this sledgehammer (Using the term literally) of a film. It uses a huge amount of film nior but pulls it off very well. Don't be discouraged by the black and white as you will not even notice it after a while plus it adds to the flavour of the film. Basicaly this movie is an incredibly violent but very cool digitalised comic strip. The three plot lines had good story lines and crunched and splattered at a break neck speed that maintained my attention with ease. Good acting jobs from all the cast with a host of well known and very suitable choices for the main characters. I highly recommend this movie with its extreme (but stylish) gore and excellent portrayal of a city that is too true to its name. Go see it! But ahh don't eat lunch before hand."
"skinnyjonob","10","0","1","21 July 2005"," A Class Act
","Having never read any of the comics, and indeed never being a comic fan, i must confess I really enjoyed this film. Simply reading the cast list, reading the American reviews (i live in Australia it only came out in mid July) and eventually seeing the previews I expected I would like the film, but probably not to the extent i did.<br/><br/>From start to finish, the way the film is shot, a black and white film with certain part coloured is very effective. The cast all shine in their individual roles. All star cast often seem to fall flat but this is one example where it's really come off well. They'll be pressed to find a cast as good as this for Sin City 2. Certainly a highlight for many is seeing Elijah Wood in a role so completely different from Frodo Baggins of Lord of the Rings.<br/><br/>As you would expect from anything that Rodriguez does, and any that Tarrentino has anything to do with, it's a very violent film. Due to the black and white filming, some scenes that are extremely violent or gory are made watchable. I appreciated this. It's not so bad that people will be really turned off by it (people who watch films of this genre that is) and yet it's still extremely cool action.<br/><br/>One thing that really impressed me was the dialog. There was no swearing basically the entire film. This is so hard to find now day. It seems if you want to make a kick ass film with lots of action and violence people won't appreciate it unless it's full of the 'f' word. That really frustrates me and is probably my biggest criticism of Tarrentino who's work I still really like. So this was very refreshing.<br/><br/>Overall, it's a fantastic film, I've seen in twice in a week and i'm sure i'd still enjoy it if I saw it again. If you know anything of the director, you'll expect there'll be lots of violence and lots of women parading around in little clothing. If you don't want to see that, then don't watch this film. Simple. Don't watch it then come complaining about all that stuff. For most of us who have enough interest to come to this page, I'm confident this film will exceed your expectations."

","Sin City was an awe inspiring cinematic event. Never have I see such an effective meld of story, acting, genre and film in one delicious package. For me there were no stand out performances as all the cast seemed to melt into their roles and the dark scenery behind them......though saying that Mickey Rourke and Rosario Dawson were excellent (I gotta stop pratting on) It is interesting to note that some of the cast who were in the same scenes together actually didn't film them together and never met.<br/><br/>In the old clichÃ© 'if you are going to see one movie this year....this should be the one!'"
"schenkenberg","10","0","1","20 July 2005"," Blood, guns and fun
","A black-and-white, ultra-violent film based on a comic book, directed by Robert Rodriguez, Frank Miller (the creator of the comics) and a special guest director Quentin Tarantino. It has to be cool! And it is. I was so happy after seeing ""Sin City"" that I decided to make a list of things I liked about this film: 1. The dialog is brilliant; 2. Although the characters say clever things almost without a break (and during the breaks we can enjoy their interesting thoughts), the action never stops either. There is always a good chance for a bullet, a car or a maniac to appear; 3. The laws of physics are the same as in comics - the cars take curves and make jumps wickedly; 4. Blood fountains appear to the places where used to be a leg or an arm - just like in ""Kill Bill""; 5. Like in ""Schindler's List"", some things are in colour: the red dress of a woman in the opening scene, the yellow face of Yellow Bastard etc; 6. Some characters never talk but they have other good qualities as shooting arrows or throwing swastika blades to kill people, or cannibalism; 7. The characters are shot, their arms and legs are ripped off, they are ran over by car, punched with hard fists... but they stay alive and fight back for a long time before dying; 8. All the bad guys get punished. Hard; 9. There is always night in Sin City; 10. It's hard to find a character in the film who is normal; 11. Elijah Wood plays a quiet boy who has long nails and cool sunglasses and who eats people. Slightly different from Frodo of ""The Lord of the Rings""... 12. Michael Clarke Duncan plays a cop who tries to waste the prostitutes; 13. The prostitutes are pretty. They also use wicked weapons to protect themselves against the cops who try to waste them... 14. Josh Hartnett from the ""masterpieces"" ""Pearl Harbour"" and ""40 Days and 40 Nights"" plays in this film. And this time he's a bad guy; 15. Tarantino directed a scene where a man with his throat cut talks... There are many more good things about this film. Rodriguez has given us ""Desperado"" and ""From Dusk Till Dawn"", Tarantino ""Reservoir Dogs"" and ""Pulp Fiction"". ""Sin City"" is a new gift from them, Frank Miller and a punch of great actors. We should thank them all..."

","This is the film that i had been waiting for. Rarely has there ever been a film where i was knocked out of my seat from the ball busting attitude of a film. Right from the first second of film I felt i would leave a happy person. The heavy black and white cinematography, the intense colour work, the awesome acting from everyone, every bit of this is flawless in my eyes.<br/><br/>Many have said this is sexiest against women, but the whole time the women were on I thought i wouldn't want to mess with them. This is really empowering for the women. As they said, the women are the law, and you wouldn't want to cross them; especially Miho.<br/><br/>All the guys are tough and forceful. Marv going on a relentless massacre for a woman he loved is the best tragic love story i have every seen in film. But all the stories are tragic love stories in one way.<br/><br/>A thought about the violence in Sin City. If this was in colour, the violence would have been so much more disturbing. Though this is a violent movie, it is very stylized; so the impact is dulled down that your not always registering the violence.<br/><br/>In all, this is Robert Rodriguez's best work. This film will never date and be as strong in 20 to 50 years time."

","Upon viewing this movie I have to say it left me totally baffled. Why is pointless excessive violence so popular?? This movie does not answer, but rather prompts such questions. I am not a fan of violence. I cant see the point in glorifying humans doing ugly things to each other. Prior to checking out this movie I did not realise that Tarantino had a guest spot, otherwise even the opportunity to see Josh in action would not have enticed me into the theatre to sit through multiple depictions of (in my opinion) seemingly endless and senseless butchery. I could appreciate the clever visual design and artistic styling of the movie - and lariat wielding Jessica is stunning, but Frodo ""How could you?"""
"Baldrick44","10","0","1","19 July 2005"," Fantastic!
","Robert Rodriguez doesn't seem to know the word moderation. His movies over the past ten years or so have either consisted of children's flicks like the Spy Kids series or violent bloodfests like the Marachi saga. The idea of an 'M' rated movie seems abhorrent.<br/><br/>Which brings us nicely to his latest venture- an adaptation of Frank Miller's graphic novel series Sin City.<br/><br/>This is not a movie for everybody's taste; and although the MA15+ may suggest that already, I find it hard to believe that this got away with a softer rating than Kill Bill Vol. 1 after what some of the characters go through. This is not the sort of cartoonesque violence that made Kill Bill so wild and stylish, rather Rodriguez, Miller and Tarantino ( as a 'guest director' ) show a much more darker and grittier world of violence that is dominated in black in white, with only the odd emphasis of colour.<br/><br/>The plot is actually 3 stories- all loosely connected with one another. Bruce Willis stars in the first one as Hartigan- a cop whose early retirement plans are cut short due to a combination of his own obsessions with justice and his partner Bob ( Michael Madsen ); only to find his obsession later on all grown up in the form of Jessica Alba and his nemesis still alive in the form of what can only be described as something seen to be believed. Mickey Rourke in the second story plays Marv- a convict who is determined to get to the bottom of who killed a hooker that spent the night with him. This perhaps sees one of the most interesting performances of the movie in the form of Elijah Wood, who after Frodo Baggins, plays Kevin- a cannibalistic stalker. Finally ( as if two wasn't enough ) there's Dwight ( Clive Owen ) who attempts to help protect the 'sisters' of Old Town led by Gale ( Rosario Dawson ) from the mob and bent cops.<br/><br/>All the cast of Sin City really come to the fore, with Owen and Willis in particular standing out and making the gritty neo-30's gangster dialog come to life. The environment is fantastic and one can only applaud Rodriguez for the time he has taken to recreate the atmosphere of Miller's novels.<br/><br/>As I said before, Sin City is not for everyone- but if you can handle violence ( and I mean violence ) then this is a movie not to be missed."
"SaintLouisRedbirds","10","0","1","16 July 2005"," Brilliantly done.
","Sin City is a movie that manages to awe everyone in the room. The way that they did it in black and white with small touches of color is very artistic. Visually, the movie, with digital animation in black and white shows that Frank Miller the original creator of the Sin City comics/Graphic Novels is a pure genius. What these people did with a movie, this man did with ink and paper. It has been said that the graphic novels of Sin City were the story boards for the actual movie. Every camera angle/shot in the movie is good, and done in a very artistically done way. Judging by the movie has been done you don't know who to give more credit to, the director, Robert Rodriguez who is a genius in his own respect, or to the co-director/ graphic novel writer, Frank Miller who I have already stated is a genius.<br/><br/>(Spoilers) The story lines in this movie also make me think that Frank Miller is a genius. He has the story line of Marv, a tough man that has had his one true love killed while he slept right next to her. Marv seeks the men that killed her, and had her ordered killed. The second Story line involves a man named Hartigan who protects a young 11 year old that is going to be raped by a pedophile who just so happens to be the son of the governor that has very high power. That being and with a corrupt police department he can do just about anything that he wishes. In that Hartigan goes to jail falsely for eight years, and when he gets out he searches out the now 19 year old girl to protect her from that very same man that attempted raping her eight years ago. A third story line appears with a man named Dwight who has affairs with a woman, finds out that she has a man around that beats her. Dwight attempts killing the woman beater who is a good cop gone bad, and then the rest of his story is covering up for the murder. (End Spoilers)<br/><br/>The movies violence is not always in good taste but it is very amazingly well done. The violence begins five minutes in and doesn't let up for the entire movie. There are things like Gun Shots, dismemberment's of the body, decapitations which I suppose would fall under the previous category, there is also a very large amount of explosions that make the film even more violent. The nudity which has been said to be very bad, is actually rather mild. The nudity usually takes place in a dark area and is barely visible. This is not to say that you should let a child view these scenes, much less the movie.<br/><br/>The All star cast is a reason to see it alone. Bruce Willis, Mickey Rourke, Jessica Alba, Benitio Del Toro, Elijah Wood, Clive Owen, Brittany Murphy, Michael Madsen, Josh Hartnett, Jaime King, and Nick Stahl all deliver amazing performances in this AMAZING movie."

It took a while for the movie to warm up, but once it hit the first peak it stayed there for much of the film. If you didn't mind the blood and guts from films like Pulp Fiction and the Kill Bill series, then you'll be able to sit watching this without squirming. There's a lot of violence in this film! The film is in black and white, but the addition of colour for blood, tears and the like is essential in order to draw your attention to certain things (this becomes even more important near the end when certain characters are completely coloured).

","It isn't that often I go out from the cinema with such a satisfying feeling for having watched such a great movie. This is surely one of the very few movies that has given me the credit to have such glorious and satisfying feeling. Probably the best movie I've watched this year and the year isn't ended yet. <br/><br/>This movie is casted of surely almost all actors you know or recognize either their faces or names - names such like Mickey Rourke, Rutger Hauer, Nick Stahl, Clive Owen, Bruce Willis, Alexis Bledel, Jessica Alba, Elijah Wood, Josh Hartnett, Michael Madsen and a few more. This movie is parted by a few histories that is tied to each other and make new ways to new stories and new mysteries. The first story is a young charming man (Josh Hartnett) who kills an unbeknown st woman who believes he loves her (it's how he gets to kill his victims). The second story is about Hartigan (Bruce Willis) who is the only last good cop left in the sin city. He is fixed by the mind of finding Nancy Callahan, 11, who is kidnapped by the town's senator's son (Nick Stahl) who later turns to be the yellow and disgusting man. He arrives in time, killing his assistants and, to last, shooting the ear and the cock off the kidnapper, saving the pretty and very scared girl. But he is betrayed by his friend, another cop, and is shot a few times. He finds himself waking up in the hospital, accused for having killed the other six girls and kidnapped this pretty girl Nancy who he actually saved. He gets into prison and eight years later, he is prepared for revenge. The third is about Marv (Mickey Rourke) who has a glorious night with Goldie, but finds her murdered besides him on the morning, making him looking for the murderer who did this, at any cost. It becomes a thrilling hunt that may finish a few lives, making a way to the person who is behind everything, the villain you never would ever imagine... or dream about. Also, another story is about Dwight (Clive Owen), who comes to the Old Town where the whores have their own laws and their own business. He is there for a business - because of Jackie (Benicio del toro) who has been with his last whore (Brittany Murphy). It turns about to be that the girls make the task of stopping him themselves - but what they don't know was that he was a cop, making the resting between the whores and the cops turning into a war... if not they are stopping it before it is too late.<br/><br/>Sin City is no usual movie. The visual effects are very unlike the others you've seen - it's all based on comic book-like, making it feel that you are the audience behind the events into a comic book, when it actually is a movie you are watching. It feels real, so real, that you just keep your eyes on the movie, afraid of missing anything meaningful, anything interesting or anything great and magnificent, or afraid of missing any special character. The movie is all black and white except from the eyes that are colored (either blue, green, brown or whatever), the yellow man (Nick Stahl), the Goldie hairs of Goldie and a red dress. Blood can turn to be red sometimes.<br/><br/>It is filmed in a real action way, a way that make this movie real, thrilling and bloody. I have never liked action movies that much before, but I really really like this movie, despite all violent scenes... it is despite everything a fine story of violence, fighting for your people against all others, finding your loving one, making murder for revenging your loving one's death, truth and corrupts. It is more bizarre than the reality but it is such a well-done movie gathered by all great actors into one and same movie and all great visual effects. The story ain't stupid either, and the characters are very different and cool. <br/><br/>I enjoyed this movie fully, never being bored or missing anything even a second... Couldn't practically blink... was completely obsessed."

If you can see it in a theater, do. If it's too late, see it on DVD on a big screen in a dark room. A cast dense with famous actors has created a series of images and moods which is perhaps unique in film history. While that seems a hyperbolic statement, I have never seen anything like this. The effect is so vivid that when you walk out of the theater you are still there, on mythic streets looking for mythic characters.

","This is good. It's tough to believe some of the actors never met each other even though their in scenes together.<br/><br/>Right, we'll talk about the cast 1st. Benicio Del Toro - wasted. Could have made so much more of this guy. I liked the scenes where he's ""dead"", their very surreal. Bruce Willis - very good, comes across a bit too ""Die Hard"" in certain scenes (I think the director should have told him to act, not pretend to be in another Die Hard Film). I still found escaping from the noose a bit difficult to believe though. Nick Stahl - Damn, I had to look up to see where I remembered him from - Terminator 3! He was pretty average, nothing to write home about. Even as the Yellow Guy he was difficult to watch. Micheal Madsen - I figure he was doing this for Quentin Tarentino as he barely appears at all, and the scenes he IS in he loses to Bruce Willis every time. Michael Clarke Duncan - I will apologize for mistaking this guy for Ving Rhames every time I see him. I think he played his role well but didn't really have very much to do in the film at all. Mickey Rourke - unrecognizable but brilliant. Took this role and ran with it, totally made it his. Sheer bliss to watch every frame he's in. Rutger Hauer - hardly appears but makes nothing of his role. I think it's time he quit the business, he seems to have lost his edge. Elijah Wood - badly cast, totally unable to play a psycho killer. And I still keep thinking he's damn Tobey Macguire from Spiderman, that I WON'T apologize for. Clive Owen - OK, 1stly I'd better make it very clear I AM actually related to Clive (he's my step-cousin) but I won't let that relationship cloud my judgment. This role is excellent, and Clive acts his damn socks and shoes off. I think this kind of role shows he CAN be the next James Bond if they wish to choose him (please do, I really want to be related to James Bond!) Clive doesn't have be American to prove himself as he shows here, he does the hard character acting, the gritty tension, the love interest, the slightly bad and mad to know talking to a corpse person. He covers the whole board and not once did I doubt him. I was shouting internally ""NO!"" when the tar just seemed to happily wash off him in the rain though. <br/><br/>Right, the female cast. Apart from Rosario Dawson, the women were generally rubbish. Rosario as Gail was excellent, a very tough yet street savvy lady, able to hold her own in any situation. I don't really know Jessica Alba or Brittany Murphy (whose voice sounded familiar then I found out she was Luanne in King of the Hill.) and quite frankly from their performances in this film I don't want to know any more about them.<br/><br/>The film is weird, it's more like watching cut scenes from a computer game, It reminded me a lot of Max Payne and XIII. If you like film noir, or comic book style films then I think you will enjoy this. I'd say to the comic book crowd hold off for the DVD which is bound to have boat loads of extras. Oh, and can someone cast the girl playing Miho in a bigger role very soon. She cast one of the rays of hope into an otherwise (apart from Rosario Dawson) bloody awful female cast. Not everyone is going to like this film, some people may not even be able to sit in the cinema through the whole film, they might get bored. Wait for the DVD then and watch the whole thing, it IS worth the effort. I didn't really understand the sequence at the end with the girl and Doctor in the elevator but maybe I wasn't supposed to. <br/><br/>The film certainly has too many traces of Quentin Tarentino's director style and they don't improve the film or make it any more watchable. Oh, and Quentin? There are more actors than Madsen and Willis about you know, try casting some new faces we don't know."

He then goes on a rampage throughout the city and vows to find her killer and get the ultimate revenge. <br/><br/>The second book, ""Those Yellow Bastards"" follows a retiring cop named Hartigan (Bruce Willis) who trails a sadist (Nick Stahl) who has kidnapped an 11 year old girl named Nancy Callahan. The sadist just happens to be the son of a senator (Powers Boothe). Hartigan is set up by his partner, Bob (Michael Madsen), and years later searches for little Nancy Callahan (Jessica Alba) and tries to protect her once again.<br/><br/>The third and final story, ""The Big Fat Kill,"" follows a group of prostitutes (Rosario Dawson, Devon Aoki, Alexis Bledel, etc.) and their protector, Dwight (Clive Owen) as they go after a cop with violent tendencies (Benicio Del Toro).<br/><br/>'Sin City' is the most stylish and visually stunning film I have ever seen.

About 90% of the movie is in black and white, with exceptions to colors thrown in there such as the color of a woman's eyes, the red or yellow of a person's blood, or the red of a woman's dress. The blood in the movie is white, but at other times can be as red as ever. This film's style doesn't really scream Robert Rodriguez or Quentin Tarantino, it all comes from Miller. If you read the novels, you would know that scene for scene, word for word, this film is spot-on. Tarantino is a special guest director because he directed only one scene in the movie (the scene where Del Toro and Owen are in the car, and Del Toro has a gun stuck in his head). The whole film was shot in front of a green screen and looks highly realistic. The characters actually interact with the set other than work around it like they did with Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow. <br/><br/>Bruce Willis, one of the most underrated actors out there gives another great performance as Hartigan,the last good cop in Basin City. Clive Owen plays Dwight perfectly, and what can I even say about Mickey Rourke as Marv? He was born for this role. He got every step, every word, every movement of Marv down. The narration by the three characters, as well as Josh Hartnett provides a lot to the story and is done very well. Benicio Del Toro plays his role slightly over-the-top, but is loving every minute of it, and so is the audience. <br/><br/>This movie is very violent. The only thing that was toned down from the graphic novels was the nudity. But all the violence, they kept. The film is ferociously funny, and really keeps the ball rolling. Some of the scenes were funnier than films that were actually comedies. 'Sin City' is a classic example of film noir, and one of the greatest too. It goes through all three stories and is very fast paced. The film starts and finishes with Josh Hartnett's hit-man love story, which, I thought was a great way to end a great movie. It's definitely not for everyone, but it's definitely worth a try."

","Before I begin, let me explain my rating system: 1 - Not worth seeing for free, 2 - Worth seeing for free, 3 - Worth paying to see, 4 - Worth paying to see again, 5 - Worth buying. When I first saw this movie, I was not prepared for it. I have never read a Sin City comic, but I knew all about Frank Miller. While I was watching this, there were some parts that were almost shocking (for me) and I thought ""this is really dark. No, this is Frank Miller."" I had no idea that Sin City was like that. I have to buy the graphic novels now. This movie was FANTASTIC. A comic book movie could not have been done better. I applaud Robert Rodriguez for his efforts, and for standing his ground with the DGA (he got kicked out...again!) I give this movie a 5/5."

","As most people that have looked forward to going to see this film, i was ready for this breath of fresh air, but upon getting into the cinema i was uncontrollably drawn into this world. One reason for this is the score. Not realising how much it complimented the film until the last story, its presence was just beneath the screen, but potent enough to carry the story. Another reason is the notion to digitally shoot the film in black and white-instead of grey and white, and this film would have been banned (and not as good) if it had been in colour. Although having the easy to grasp plot lines similar to that of Kill Bill volume 1, it still manages to make the viewer watch for any word or movement that could change the story all that more. Choosing 3 stories was a great idea on Rodriquez's's part, as it means that nothing gets boring, and u get an instant idea that this city really does not have a good side (or a day time). One of the most enjoyable revelations looking back is that there were no good guys, not one of them could honestly say they were fighting for the forces of good, yet your always happy when they get their way. Sin City is not a disappointment like most films of its calibre."

Having frank Miller doing most of the work, makes this the closest movie adaptation of a comic, the only fault is missing certain parts of the comic, but honestly they were not really needed. Mickey was A-1 choice for Marv, he WAS Marv. Holy cow, magnificent. And Willis was great as Hartigan ( had him down to as well). This is one movie I will Have to get on DVD.

","The first thing I would like to say is that a goddamn love this movie it's so fresh, original and sexy it completely blew me away. With me been a huge fan of the graphic novels I went in the cinema with a cringe hoping that Rodriguez didn't ruin one of the greatest graphic novels ever, even with Frank Miller co-directing.<br/><br/>But wow, the dialogue is word for word and even the frames are exactly like the comic, even when you go down to little things like lighting and sound. The actors are all chosen perfectly for the film especially, Elijah Wood as Kevin and Bruce Willis as Hartigan, which both shocked me in their performances even though Elijah doesn't say a word in the whole film. The perfect actor cast in this film and who is the heart of the graphic novels is Marv played by Mickey Rouke he surprised me the most because he portrays the character perfectly to the last plaster.<br/><br/>The movie has everything, love, hate, revenge, death, war and some bad-ass action and fighting beautiful brought to life for the screen.<br/><br/>The Three stories the film portrays are The Big Fat Kill, That Yellow Bastard and The Hard Goodbyue which are some interesting stories but can't wait to see if they do Familt Values and A Dame to Kill for. <br/><br/>The world is truly believable even though it is all green screen which makes the movie one of the greatest CGI movies of all time. So, to leave you with a summary it is the best adapted comic book adaptation even better than X-men. The characters are fully rounded and the performances mesmerising. Rodriguez has gained the respect of me and hopefully of you as one of the most imaginative directors in today's cinema.<br/><br/>P.S -- Go see this movie if you don't your dumb.<br/><br/>J.T McGrath"

I feel that everyone played their character the way they should have and it was amazing to watch. I do not know many movies that can be so awesome in all aspects from writing to directing to acting.

","Sin city.<br/><br/>What can a man say? what can anyone say.? I really liked this movie. Sure it was violent but then again this adds to the film and the very essence of the story. This is a SIN CITY for crying out loud, nothing about it is meant to be nice so if you don't like violence don't watch.<br/><br/>When i finished i tried and tried to think of a REALLY bad actor or actress in the movie. Yes it was a 'feast for the eyes' a 'truly masterful visionary piece if mise en scene' bla bla. It entertained me. The city where the sun never shine intrigued me, it kept me interested. So what if the violence is over the top (Marv getting hit THREE times by a car) Who cares? It interested me. Seeing Elijah Wood as a non-hobbity monster cannibal who, may i add, dodges what? Three gun shots with lightning speed! and near on annihilate the mountain that is Marv made me think, 'MAN! Don't fu...i mean, don't mess with hobbits Sauron, now look what you did to him'<br/><br/>A few days before i went to see a movie called ONG BAK. That was really brilliant action so it kind of deadened my senses to the short fight scenes in THIS movie but standing alone from what i saw previously Sin City was brilliant and if you can allow yourself to live like these characters for the Two and an odd minutes it lasts then you will feel the sin seep in."

I have now seen Sin City 6 times and it still does not bore me, to do this is an absolute treat.<br/><br/>There is not a bad comment I can make: excellent direction from both Rodriguez and Tarantino: excellent cast that could not have been bettered and finally an excellent portrayal of the graphic novels.

","The strength and power of this movie lie in it's depiction of unreality. A comic book world is perfectly created here along with a comic book atmosphere. Everything here is mega-cool, melodramatic and ultra violent, all with the safe distance of fantasy. The men are blatantly macho with only the evil characters being unnecessarily rough, lacking in a moral motive for their actions. The women are sharp of tongue, tough as nails and sexy as hell! The intermittent use of colour that is used to emphasise or draw attention to something also works well and gives Sin City one of the most original styles seen on screen. Three stories are told here and while they don't really have much to do with each other, bar their setting in Sin City, the movie still fits together. It's probably a little over-long but generally it rolls along well and there's a good few laughs, even if half of them are at some poor stool getting his posterior royally kicked. Well worth seeing but just short of perfect!"
"Enchantress19","10","0","1","14 June 2005"," A Night Time City Full of Gulity Pleasures & the Choice Between Revenge & Redemption
","Sin City is a night time city full of guilty pleasures where the people are torn between revenge and redemption. Based off the graphic novels by Frank Miller, Sin City is the best movie I've seen all year, and is the only one that really sticks to the graphic novels. I say graphic novels because there is a difference between graphic novels and comic books. Graphic novels are aimed toward adults, as Sin City should be, comics toward children.<br/><br/>How many of you saw Kill Bill: Volume 1? Do you remember the scene where The Bride is fighting in Japan and the screen suddenly went black and white? That was because Quentin Tarantino was told that the scene was too bloody and it would either have to go to black and white or to be cut altogether. He opted for black and white. If Sin City hadn't been intentionally done in black and white, it would have been forced to be. There is great violence in this movie. People are getting shot or killed with knives and swords or pipes. But it is all, almost, done with a good purpose. You may be startled but you think, ""Hey, the guy deserved it."" This movie is really three of the graphic novels out into one movie. The Hard Goodbye, The Big Fat Kill, and That Yellow Bastard. These three graphic novels all take place in the fictional town of Basin City, also called Sin City, where you don't know if the cops are clean or dirty, where women walk the streets, the bad guys are as high up as a United States Senator, and where danger is around every corner and there is no place to hide.<br/><br/>The Hard Goodbye tells the tale of Marv. Marv who has never known real love in his entire life until Goldie. Marv only knows Goldie for one night when she is murdered while he sleeps right next to her. It becomes Marv's goal to find Goldie's murderer and make him pay.<br/><br/>The Big Fat Kill is a story about Dwight. Dwight makes his original appearance in book 2, A Dame to Kill For, which is really just background information for book 3. Dwight goes to the part of Sin City known as Old Towne. Old Towne is run by the street walkers, the leader of which was romantically linked to Dwight, and the women have a perilous truce with the police. The girls keep that part in order and keep out the mob, but when something goes horribly wrong and a messy body gets discovered, it's up to Dwight to protect his friends, even if it means killing a whole lot of people.<br/><br/>That Yellow Basard is the account of an aging cop named Hartigan who is an hour away from retiring when he gets a call that an 11-year-old girl has been kidnapped by a lunatic; a loose end that Hartigan hadn't tied up.<br/><br/>All these stories are in the movie and are very clear to follow. They hardly ever overlap. What makes these stories really come to life is the color. The majority of the movie is in black and white. But every now and then you'll see a splash of color. In the opening scene, you see a woman standing on a balcony. Her surroundings are completely black and white, but her dress is a vibrant red. As are her lips. And when her eyes are mentioned, they light up green then fade back to black and white. It is the little surprises of color that makes you not want to take your eyes from the screen. The dialog is just as amazing.<br/><br/>When the characters actually talk or when you hear their thoughts, it is like watching an old 40's movie. One of my favorite lines is right at the beginning and it goes, ""The silencer makes a whisper of the gunshot."" Nobody talks like that anymore and it makes the movie that much more exciting. The dialog is just so old fashioned that it makes you remember the days of tommy guns and Dick Tracy. A character named Bob is talking to Hartigan and he says, ""You're pushing 60, and you've got a bum ticker."" It almost makes you giggle, if it weren't for what happens next, but we won't go into that.<br/><br/>This is one of the most gifted casts I've ever seen in one movie. You have Bruce Willis, Clive Owen, Mickey Rourke, Jamie King, Carla Gugino, Jessica Alba, Nick Stahl, Josh Hartnett, Elijah Wood, Benicio Del Toro, Michael Clark Duncan, Rosario Dawson, Michael Madsen, Brittany Murphy, and Alexis Bledel. Not to mention Robert Rodriguez directing with the writer Frank Miller, and Quentin Tarantino directing a scene. This movie is just There are almost no words describing it. You just have to go see it for yourselves. You have to. Your life will not be complete unless you go and see Sin City. I mean it. Now. Go find a car! ""A hardtop, with a decent engine, and make sure it's got a big trunk."""

"FatChino","9","0","1","10 June 2005"," Comic book adaptation come good
","POTENTIAL VERY MINOR SPOILERS The first real comic book adaptation I had the privilege of viewing was the original brilliantly campy Batman ... Adam West with his lawful haircut wore underpants over his tights, zapped, biffed and socked his way out of being boiled alive in giant teacups and treated Robin like he was a little kid. And it really was fantastic!!! Those pows and thwacks may have been a tad crude, but added to those trips up Gotham's skyline and the ridiculous sets and eccentric villains Batman made for an entertaining 25-odd minutes of loose comic book adaptation.<br/><br/>But this is 2005. We've seen varying degrees of success in region of adapting comics since 1966. The earlier Batman's set the bar too high for more recent efforts to reach (eagerly awaiting Batman Begins); Dick Tracy definitely showed some promise and the recent Spiderman's and X-Men (to a lesser extent) movies showed what could really be done by combining modern day technology with genuinely interesting story telling.<br/><br/>First off and most obviously Sin City's striking and innovative use of colour and technology sets it apart from most other films you are likely to have the pleasure to see. In an interview I heard Clive Owen (and he himself knowingly admitted it clichéd) that this is something that is totally new; and the man is right. This film noirish effort is filmed in black and white ... there are no grey areas ... the spilling of scarlet blood or the flash of blue eyes is the closest you'll get to the relief of colour. The scene in which Bruce Willis' character is about to close in on Roark Jr. and he is standing by a massive farm door, particularly struck me, in that it look as if a frame from the comic had been drawn into the film. Another interesting touch is the use of silhouette frames at key points in the film.<br/><br/>Sadly I myself haven't yet read any of Frank Miller's Sin City comics but the inclusion of the author as a co-director (as well as reports I've heard) suggests the film is particularly loyal to the original story lines. Tarantino manages to muscle his way into Miller's vision and is a 'special guest' director for one scene.<br/><br/>The performances of those occupying the corrupt hell hole that this Basin City are very solid to say the least. Mickey Rourke is particularly forcefully as 'psychokiller' Marv, while Alba and Willis stand strong in their story about a weathered cop stabbed in the back for protecting an innocent young girl. Elijah Wood gives an unnerving and totally silent performance as the demented Kevin, a young cannibal. The violence although totally over the top (this is a comic book after all where men can take up to 5 shots and survive) is unrelentingly brutal; scenes involves the male genitalia are very gruesome and had me wincing for a minute. The film itself aside from its obvious quite brilliant and striking presentation is an unrelenting testosterone rush from start to finish. It runs like a film noir with the main characters narrating as woman with near perfect features seem to either end up dead or in the arms of some vengeful do-gooder (or longing for those arms). This is surely reflected in the female cast; as big a fan as I am of Brittany Murphy the prospect of playing a scantily clothed stripper or soon to be dead hooker may not have appealed A-list actresses. I think I must have been joined by have the cinema when a slow sweeping shot of Alba borough an unwitting smile to my face! Sin City is definitely an innovative piece of work from the visual artistic perspective; add to this some quite gripping story lines and you've got something that sees the progress of comic book adaptation in cinema take another step forward."

","Set in a city where there's no good  just degrees of bad, worse and evil. Where all the men have square jaws, muscles and unstable personality disorders. Where the women are all sexy and dangerous (and invariably wearing very little). Sin City brings to life that seedy underworld forever hinted at in films but never carried off with such enviable style and talent. The exaggerated personalities of every character  all of which have purpose and a place of their own in the film, adds to the spectacle of such aesthetic magnitude that you'll have difficulty taking it all in.<br/><br/>This film is, in short, an instant cult hit. It has the makings of any truly crazy, violent and stylish film  beautiful hookers, twisted cops, cannibals, torture, and some tough thugs who just won't die! You need to see it to believe it, you need to live with the characters in their world and absorb yourself in the atmosphere in the cinema. Go see it  to believe that films this good really do exist.

But there was little plot. The stories are simply too obvious. I found the movie boring, down-right stupid in its wrecked portray of the extremely fictional Basin City, and also a bit disgusting.<br/><br/>I guess the movie is just like the cartons of Frank Miller. If you like those, go see the movie, you will probably enjoy it.

","Although those of you in the States have has Sin City floating around since April, Europe just saw this adaptation of Frank Miller's gritty comic book series hit cinema screens last week. A long awaited film, was it worth it? For starters, it's NOT Film Noir, I'm not gonna go through what makes a film, Film Noir, just know that Sin City is not Film Noir, it is in fact more accurate to call it Neo Noir. That being said, it mimics what made old Film Noir classics like Double Indemnity closely, with a bit more violence, cursing and of course naked women.<br/><br/>What it presents us with is a unique style of film that really you should go and see just for that, it's unique visuals make it worth while. Unfortunately that's it's weakness. Rodriguez was so caught up in transferring Miller's comic to life he left the characters as flat as they were on the pages. With little to no character development you'll either hate the characters or love them.<br/><br/>The script didn't let down, it followed the noir style closely, fast talking and each story narrated by the main character is a typical ""detective"" way. Again this is a thing you're either going to love or hate. So if you're a fan of Film/Neo Noir then you're going to walk away from Sin City with a little more than enjoyment than most people will.<br/><br/>So, a film you should go and see for the style of it if for nothing else, but worthwhile all in all."
"Paynebyname","8","0","1","9 June 2005"," I really enjoyed it
","I walked into this film not expecting a great deal. Thought it would be another Kill Bill that was all style and no substance. A film that with so many actors vying for decent screen time would dilute a story into a glorified pantomime.<br/><br/>What a great surprise so see a film that is refreshingly adult, cool to look at and has involving stories. I wasn't sure how I would get on with the high contrast comic book look to the film but it actually works. The fact that they set the world, its physics, what does and doesn't work from the beginning means that you have a control for your intelligence to lock onto. For instance someone might get shot 10 times and still be alive which although preposterous to begin with seems normal once you become involved with the film. It also sticks to these guidelines so you don't a get a normal fight one minute and then another where the confines of gravity seem to have been forgotten the next.<br/><br/>It's so good to see a film that isn't afraid to be squarely aimed at adults. Women have sex but then are not unrealistically scrambling for the covers to hide their nakedness, the revenge motives are played through to their natural conclusion without characters going soft and the blood is liberally applied to blows and injuries.<br/><br/>Mickey Rourke is sensational. I never used to like him as he was quite arrogant in his early days but falling on hard times and forced to do 'straight to video' b movies seemed to provide him with some humility and allows me to appreciate his craft even more. His story is the best of the three. Bruce Willis is also on top form and the rest of the cast deliver very good performances. Clive Owen was a little weak, I don't rate him as that accomplished an actor and for me it showed. But this couldn't dampen the creative flair, the depth of story or sheer brutality of the action. There is plenty of female flesh on show (most of it very nice), a smattering of humour where needed, generous amounts of violence delivered with gusto and crunching sound effects and a good score.<br/><br/>Overall I was very impressed. An enjoyable film that was great to look at as well as being involving and rewarding to watch."

","I have just left the cinema. I feel a wide range of emotions. All of these emotions, however, are positive. What a film! The best way to describe this film is a black & white meeting between Batman and all Quentin Tarantino films. The way the film is delivered, you really get the feeling that it stays true to the comic book. Most of the graphics are very cartoony and some of the violence is occasionally over-the-top, which is what makes you feel like you're watching a very, very violent comic book come to life. There is an unreal amount of blood. However, the blood doesn't always come out on the screen as red which, in a way, adds to the disturbance. The acting in the film isn't the finest, but it doesn't need to be. The directing is superb and overall I left the cinema feeling like I had witnessed a new era in film."

It's enough simply to have these fantastic, ridiculous creations on screen courtesy of Miller and co-director Rodriguez who 'shot and cut' and also scored the film's music.<br/><br/>Set in Basin City, part of Sin City 700 feet below ground level, the film starts off with Hartigan (Willis) on his last day on the job as a cop - ready to go out in a blaze of glory.<br/><br/>With his partner Bob (Madsen) Hartigan tracks down the whereabouts of a little girl, Nancy Callahan (Alba), who has been abducted.<br/><br/>A lone good man in a bad town, Hartigan battles against forced more twisted and powerful than him, coming up against a powerful senator (Boothe, best known for Walter Hill's Southern Comfort) and his son (Stahl).<br/><br/>Meanwhile Marv (Rourke) is wondering who could have killed beautiful blonde Goldie (Jaime King) who lies next to him in bed.<br/><br/>Marv, an indestructible killing machine, has an iron- shaped flat top hairdo and a Kirk Douglas-modelled nose and chin taken to an extreme.<br/><br/>This already odd-looking hoodlum with a hefty heart rounds off his look by appropiating other men's leather coats and having little white plasters all over the cuts on his body from jumping from cars or windows.<br/><br/>The lovable maniac is as determined as Hartigan to uncover the reason for Goldie's death and he starts to make people talk  he calls it ""killing my way to the truth"" - until a trail leads to Cardinal Roark (Hauer) and creepy killer Kevin (Wood).<br/><br/>All good things come in threes and Clive Owen's Dwight shows up, cut from the same saintly-cum-sinister cloth as Hartigan and Marv.<br/><br/>While Dwight isn't as riveting as his fellow vigilantes he does introduce us to the ladies of Old Town, the prostitutes who patrol their patch. <br/><br/>His old girlfriend Gail (Dawson) joins forces with Dwight when Jackie-Boy (Del Toro) disturbs the peace in Old Town and a whole lot more blood is shed in the name of glorious entertainment.<br/><br/>All this and Irish terrorists, ridiculous quiffs, fantastic lines, a bald Nazi, gold balls for eyes and the scariest silent martial artist cannibal you will have seen.<br/><br/>Sin City is released in a digital print which makes all the dirt and sleaze stand out magnificently and even lets film fans focus on the oddly quivering lips of Josh Hartnett at one point.<br/><br/>Along with Hartnett at the bottom of the talent barrel, Brittany Murphy and Madsen are as crummy as ever but Rourke and Del Toro cancel them out the second they're on screen and the casting as a whole is just right.<br/><br/>A sequel has been announced but, for now, feast your eyes on the rightful heir to A Clockwork Orange, Dobermann and Pulp Fiction. A monstrously good time."

","If you like graphic novels, larger than life characters, women wearing very little clothing and lots and lots of violence then this is the movie for you. <br/><br/>It's the sort of film the teenage lads at my partners school will absolutely love.<br/><br/>It is incredibly stylish, all black and white except for a few splashes of well chosen colour. I'm a big movie goer and I think it's a must see film ...

","There isn't much to say about this film, because it's so good, that many people have commented it. Although it seems a bit pointless to share my opinion withe the others, I'll do it anyway. Why?<br/><br/>Well, Sin City is one of the best film I've watched (and I've done several times already). Great cast, fantastic atmosphere, quite a plot for a ""badass movie"". The film is divided into 4 parts - but the 1st and 4th are about the same man, Frank Hartigan (Bruce Willis), who is a hero cop. Standard plot, but nicely done.<br/><br/>The second part is story about revenge. Marv (Mickey Rourke) wants to kill the bastards that assassinated his new girlfriend, Goldie. In my opinion that's the best part of the movie. Rourke plays really tough guy, whose devotion to a girl he's spent only a single night with, is moving. Even bad asses have some feelings!!<br/><br/>The 3rd part is also great. The plot may sound a bit funny, because the main problem is to defend... the whore town!! Clive Owen's performance is great - he is calm but ruthless and Benizio del Toro was even better. You just have to watch it! All of the actors were fantastic, just like the girls, who were beautiful, charming and sometimes mysterious. I only disliked the fact that 99% of them where prostitutes!!!!<br/><br/>Those of film-maniacs who watched ""Payback"" with Mel Gibson and ""Last Man Standing"" with Bruce Willis and Christopher Walken have probably spotted that the main character not only acts, but he also ""comments"" everything and tells the whole story to the watchers. That's really cool effect. The same thing was in ""Sin City"". Rourke, Willis and Owen are doing outstanding job, their comments are full of emotions (especially anger),passion; the actors are really engaged in all their actions and I really appreciate this. It seems quite obvious that they enjoyed their roles. Pity that the film is about 1:48 long, because if it was longer, we could enjoy more of the characters. <br/><br/>I hope that Mickey Rourke has started a ""new era"" in his acting career because ""Man On fire"" (2004) and ""Sin city"" (2005) are excellent movies and in my opinion we may expect more of Rourke at his best in the future!<br/><br/>Anyway, watch Sin City, because if you don't, you'll miss a great production............."
"cigarette_burn","9","0","2","4 June 2005"," Five Word Review: Beautiful, shocking, witty, sexy, sleazy.
","Sin City (2005) Directed by Robert Rodriguez and Frank Miller <br/><br/>So the start of the summer blockbusters is upon us and the season opens with this very bold and exciting movie, Sin City. You've seen the trailers maybe even read the ""graphic novels"" (that's comics!) that the film is based on but does this visual treat hold up for 2 hours and 8.50 of your hard earn cash? With some critics calling it the new Pulp Fiction (in part due the input of 'Quest Director' Quentin Tarantino), a bar that high is going to be hard to clear but Sin City does it with style and then some.<br/><br/>Based on three graphic novels in the Sin City series by Frank Miller, the film plays out in three separate chapters much like the Pulp Fiction it has been compared to. Each segment is narrated by its central character, Marv (Mickey Rourke), Dwight (Clive Owen) and Hartigan (Bruce Willis), following their story through Basin City (knock off the 'Ba' and what do you get?) as they encounter revenge, violence, sex, drugs, love and hate. Following the film's time line can be tricky on first viewing, however the film will hold up to multiply viewing and a re-watch will prove enjoyable and possibly rewarding as you connect all the characters together to form a much broader picture of Sin City. A violent and unsettling place, Sin City does not shy away from any form of body inflicting damage. Fists, teeth, knives, cars, dogs, razor wire, sledgehammers and rubber tubing are all put to good use in order to torture and kill. Sin City has more than earned its 18's cert and probably would not have passed the Censors where the film not shot in black and white. <br/><br/>And its the black and white ""graphic novel"" look may very well catch most viewers off guard. Shot in a digital back lot all the actors performed in front of blue screen with all the background added later. While this original look, broken throughout the film only by select and significant splashes of colour, is at first a shock and then a pleasure to watch its impact is soon lost within the first 20mins of viewing. This is however no great loss as the film's great ensemble cast quickly picks up the film and carries it beautifully to the end. A great comeback for Mickey Rourke, and with Bruce Willis only being Bruce Willis for one quick line (""Wait here for me to come back, I'll keep you safe."" Very Die Hard!). Notable supporting roles include Brittany Murphy, looks great and proves that her 8 Mile performance wasn't just a once off, and Josh Hartnett for brief but excellent opening and closing of the film. <br/><br/>Overall Sin City is a sick pleasure to watch. A film that must hold the record for ""most male genitalia"" dismembered, it is bold, inventive, witty and in your face. Director Robert Rodriguez has taken his source material, of which he is a big fan, directly translated it to the screen and created a film that has pleased fans of the comic and is also accessible to the movie watching public. Co-directed with Sin City creator Frank Miller, a 'Guest Director' spot filled by Tarantino and a cast that will make ""top 10 ensemble cast"" lists for years to come it seems Sin City is set to be an instant hit. Sin City is bold, creative film-making but perhaps not for everyone. With Sin City 2 and 3 due in 2007/2008 is longevity in the public eye is assured but if Sin City will go down in the books, as a classic is a matter only time will tell. Go see it. Go see it again. Then put it on your DVD's to buy list. And let's leave at that for the moment.<br/><br/>Overall: Sin City shocks, titillates and teases. Funny, bloody and visually stunning, it proves itself one the best comic book adaptations of recent times. Even with such a great cast it will still remain to be seen if Sin City can outdo summer heavy hitters such as War of the World, Mr. And Mrs. Smith and Land of the Dead.<br/><br/>Five Word Review: Beautiful, shocking, witty, sexy, sleazy."

","Now i may be being a little over excited with the 10/10 but it says excellent next to it and the film was excellent so i feel justified.<br/><br/>Firstly, you have to take this film with a pinch of salt, not only is this film the best film out this year so far but it is also one of the funniest. People say ""it's horrific images and it horrifies me that people enjoy them"". It's not real! and that's the thing you need to remember he, this film is so violent (i don' think there is a swear word and there's some nudity and it still has a 18 certificate) its funny! The scene where the deformed phsyco-path Marv is driving along whilst grinding a man face into the road is hilarious, it's so ludicrous you can't take it to seriously! As for the effects, well that's genius too! it is the ultimate graphic novel adaptation. Even the rain looks like real comic book rain! I could ramble on about it but allot of the reviews do so i'll just leave you with, u may love it or u may hate it, there probably isn't a half way view. but everyone should watch this film at least once."

","WOOOOOOOOOOOOWWWW!!! i sat behind a couple who decided to go on a date to see an action packed film, yet at every point when there was violence and believe me there was plenty- ultra violence, they jumped and shrieked. this summarises the film - an extremely harrowing taste of backstreet life in Sin city. Remarkably, the influence of Tarantino can clearly be seen even tho he spent only one day on shoot. So when i'm asked whether or not it was a good film or not, i am unable to express its brilliance. Gritty, Stylish, Gory (weak men steer clear- you'll see!) and an unforgettable cast make this the best film of the decade so far.<br/><br/>Great to see Rourke and Willis back on top form too.<br/><br/>Rob."
"chakoian","10","0","2","4 June 2005"," Dark, Shocking, Intense, and Wonderful
","Truly the best movie I've seen in years. I had no idea what to expect when I went to see this flick and was very pleasantly surprised. The dark comic book dialog and cinematography is captivating. They weren't afraid to go heavy on blatant comic style violence and sexuality which added much to the feel of the movie. The black and white with color highlights was a very nice touch as well. I haven't been this impressed by the uniqueness and intensity of a movie since Pulp Fiction. It's the kind of movie that makes you react out loud without even knowing that you're doing it. I found myself exclaiming ""holy sh#t!"" and other various explatives in the theater at several scenes throughout the movie which is out of character for me. Well I don't want to give anything away about the movie so I'll stop at this, you get the idea - this movie gets my highest recommendation. If you don't love this movie, you have no taste."
"deastman_uk","8","0","2","4 June 2005"," All in Black and white. And some red. Plus a bit of yellow.
","From start to finish you are in BaSin City. No explanations, no updates, just the facts. Everything revolves around bringing a recognisable yet outlandish comic noir world to screen - the effects are completely slave to this one master. The format is Pulp Fiction, the violence is Reservoir Dogs, the action is From Dusk Till Dawn. The result is in some ways more satisfying than all of these.<br/><br/>The performances are pitch perfect. The only slightly bum note is Clive Owen, who has a little difficulty with his performance. He doesn't have the background or depth to really pull his character off - too many Brit flicks have tainted his ability to act. Everyone else knows the territory and come off the page without effort.<br/><br/>So pull on your mac, get into your hard top and get some action in Basin City."
"TomiusJ","8","0","2","4 June 2005"," Masterful and stylish: Modern cinema at it's best.
","SIN CITY (2005) <br/><br/>Sin City is a bit like Pulp Fiction fused with Kill Bill and tumbled around for a bit in a comic book universe. It's incredibly stylish for one: it's all in black and white and filmed in a way so that it even feels like you're reading Frank Miller's original graphic novels. Of course, the main question is...<br/><br/>...do they match up to the comics? The answer is yes, definitely. In fact, I may even go as far to say that the movie is better (although some may not agree). Frank's work has always had a different edge to it, and the film captivates that edge to it's peak and broadens our view on the hellish (and masterful) Basin City.<br/><br/>Of course, it's not without it's flaws. A few here and there, but nothing to get too worked up about. I will say though; for somebody who hasn't read the novels, it's a little hard to follow first time through. The acting is superb, especially from Bruce Willis and the beautiful Jessica Alba. Their relationship on-screen seems heartfelt and ""meant."" The other actors don't sink either: everyone who appears in this movie(and there's a lot, I tell you) puts forth a memorable and well-orientated performance.<br/><br/>Overall, Sin City is probably the greatest comic book to screen adaptation of all time. It's fast, cool, slick and holds true to it's purpose. This will forever remain as one of those ""cult"" classics that people remember for years to come. Exceptional. (10/10)"
"LeonardPine","10","0","2","4 June 2005"," Miss it at your peril!
","Sin City won't be for everyone, no doubt about it. Its far to different to be appreciated by the masses, but if its on your wavelength, prepare to be thrilled!<br/><br/>When the film begins it takes a while to get used to the radical style of film-making on show here, but its not long before you become immersed in the fantastic fantasy noir world that Rodriguez and Miller have created. Never before has a graphic novel been so faithfully and lovingly put on screen, you may find yourself wondering as i did, why can't all comic book movies be made like this? <br/><br/>Visually, Sin City is quite simply awesome. Gorgeous black and white splattered with moments of devastating colour. The action is jaw droppingly executed and is hideously violent with lashings of black humour, witness the scene where the hero has a conversation with a dude who was dispatched in the scene before!<br/><br/>As for the cast, well, what a line up! Its true Mickey Rourke steals the film as Marv, but the rest of the cast are well up to the job, even Clive Owen gives a good performance! And wait till you see Elijah Wood's terrifying incarnation! <br/><br/>Films like this come along all to rarely. Something that dares to be different, and doing it so amazingly well. With the way women are portrayed in the film some may argue its just a male wet fantasy, and they're probably right, but thats all the film is, a fantasy, not to be taken seriously.<br/><br/>But do yourself a favor and visit Sin City. The best time to be had in the cinema this year so far. Cooler than cool!"
"wickedrebel","10","0","1","3 June 2005"," Extraordinary
","This is by far Rodriguez's best work so far, how he managed to put in all the stories together, of course with the help of Miller, nonetheless this is a great film no matter what people say. To those who are saying that it is to violent, to much sex content, let me say this, that is what our world is coming to so deal with it. This could very well be the future of a major city even a country such as Cuba, note the similarities such as technology, situation and other things like that. However if you 2 dimensional critics get out of your little boxes, you would see that this film is great in its artistic style as well. The camera angles, the effects, the acting every thing is superb. I do not consider this a perfect film, but I do rank it a 10 out of 10, and I do believe future film makers will want to see this film and take many of its contents to use in their own films. I recently read Rodriguez and Miller are already planning what will be Sin City 2 and I cannot wait to see that one and I am sure it will be something artistic as well as innovative."
"djbol-1","9","0","1","3 June 2005"," Most stylish film ever?
","Frank Miller's Sin City is probably one of the best films I've seen this year. In fact probably longer than that. From the offset, the use of colour is perfect. It is filmed to perfection. Many have compared the style of this film to that of Pulp Fiction but I disagree. The only similarity with this other masterpiece is that it moves from story to story. This film depicts three stories in the nightmare that is Sin City. The cast are perfect for their roles, even Elijah Wood surprisingly making a great villain. Having not read the books that this film is based on, the stories themselves are fairly good. However the main drawback of this film is that I didn't feel as attached to the characters as I would have hoped considering what happens. I think this may be to do with the style in which it has been filmed. This will surely be the judge of the film rather than the stories themselves. The use of the colour in particular the contrast between black and white is spectacularly clever and still appropriate. The style of this is consistent from the opening scene to the end credits. This film is well worth a watch. The unique concept that Frank Miller has put across in this film mixed with the cinematography and the cast makes this an amazing film. However, I'm not so sure Sin City 2 or 3 will live up to this."

Normally when you expect so much from a film, you end up being disappointed because it rarely, if ever lives up to your expectations, but this one most definitely did! You rarely get to see so many legendary actors all in one film....Benecio Del Toro, Micky Rourke, Bruce Willis, Ellijah Woods, Clive Owen, Rosario Dawson...even some actors who I have never been a fan of in the past, but everyone did an amazing job, and if there were only 2 hours left of my life, I can't think of many better ways to spend them!!!

","This adaptation of Frank Miller's graphic novels completely blew me away when I saw it. I never read any of the comics but the film is a true must-see. An all star cast including Bruce Willis, Mickey Rourke, Clive Owen and many more give excellent performances as the various inhabitants of the vile Basin City.<br/><br/>The stories are not pleasant, but then again it wouldn't be so compelling if they were. None of the characters are really saints, except for Willis as disgraced cop Hartigan, but the true bad guys are the Roark family personified by corrupt cardinal Rutger Hsuer, his equally unpleasant brother Powers Boothe and the truly horrible Yellow Bastard (Nick Stahl). Elijah Wood also delivers a chilling performance as silent cannibal Kevin.<br/><br/>The look of the film is great and the cast all give it 100%. This is one of the must-see movies of the year and I look forward to the sequels."

The atmosphere - of seedy, decayed urban life where everyone has to fight to stay alive and every authority figure is plain corrupt and where your best friend can be your worst enemy - is what this film is all about, and it delivers it in spades and then some.

On the one hand I saw House of Wax..bland, by the books crappy flick with no originality at all - OK, except for the end-. On the other hand you have Sin City, which is so damn good comparing it with the other film mentioned is an insult.<br/><br/>How can I describe this experience, because this isn't a film anymore it is an experience. Think blade runner, think Dark city.. think the good and dark parts of batman and even some pieces of Riddick and it doesn't begin to even come close to the eye candy which is presented to you here. So it has atmosphere but this is just the start, the stories and main characters are very believable in their own reality. A reality which comes to life in the first few minutes of the film. Both Bruce Willis and Mickey Rourke do a fantastic job in putting the comic book onto the big screen and speaking of Mr Rourke; just when I thought it was time to post a missing persons poster he is back with possibly the best part of his career. The rest of the cast is also good although Mr Owen is a bit bland in this character.<br/><br/>There are a couple of films no one can miss, films that change the way films are made. ALiens come to mind in the cinema, 24 on television and now there is sin city.<br/><br/>If you are going to see one film see this one. Very, very good."
"dmc102","7","0","1","29 May 2005"," Not without its faults, but generally a solid piece of Modern Cinema
","A tempting collaboration between comic author Frank Miller, movie whiz kid Robert Rodruiguez and everyone's favorite eccentric Quentin Tarantino binds CGI and good live performances well. Produced in much the same way as Rodruiguez's other recent efforts, the filming was confined to a Green Screen sound stage and the backgrounds added in post production. This process seems to get better with every film, though I would not say that any of these cyber-movies have surpassed ""Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow"" in their mixing of CGI and actors.<br/><br/>Sin City is a movie aimed at adults, but only specific audiences. Fans of either the comic series or gritty crime dramas will enjoy the film, but all others may walk away disappointed. The Bruce Willis/Michael Madsen segments of the film are typically Tarantino - the first portion of this segment is easily the best. The picture is divided into mini-movies, each with their own casts led by a name actor. The best of these is easily the Clive Owen segment, in which he helps a group of inner-city hookers defend themselves against thugs. Owen's good acting overcomes his slightly unconvincing American acting, and the segment passes through nicely.<br/><br/>The film has its flaws, the Mickey Rourke segment for instance is at best tedious. Rourke seems suited to the roll, but the secondary characters and the plot of the segment don't really 'work'. Some of the plot points are boring and unnecessary and some of the sequences are so dark that they are simply not enjoyable. Small roles by Josh Hartnett and Michael Clarke Duncan add nothing to the film, Hartnett's part is especially silly and was obviously shot over one day or so.<br/><br/>The best performance of the film comes from Bruce Willis, who is totally convincing as an aging cop. The on screen relationship between Willis and Jessica Alba are excellent, evidently displaying acting talent from the young actress and a return to form for Willis. Mickey Rourke is fine as Marv, perhaps only Rourke can play such a disgusting character who, despite being the hero, is revolted by the viewer. Elijah Wood does what it says on the tin as a demented serial killer, but the segment he appears in is far to vague. The random introductions of characters does not help and the story plod along.<br/><br/>Overall, Sin City is a solid movie, ideal viewing for fans of the genre. But one thing constantly annoyed me whilst watching the film; I got so bored with gun shots and punches to the jaw that I was about ready to administer one on myself! I feel their was a slight overuse of weapons in the film - but I suppose that would be expected. This is possibly the closest Comic Book conversion in movie history, and fans of the originals will obviously love this. Be careful, you will either love this film or be disappointed by it. I myself loved it, but pointed out the flaws for the purpose of reviewing it.<br/><br/>My rating is 7/10 - See it but be warned!"
"ureshinamida","9","0","1","26 May 2005"," Great movie
","I was a huge fan of the comics before the movie came out. I love the cinematography, the style, the characters, the wild situations... The acting is wonderful, especially from Marv.<br/><br/>As much as I love Sin City, the movie isn't perfect. I don't mind the violence and the movie's unique edge at all. However sometimes it was slow-paced. And, like all people who see a book-made-into-movie, I found myself questioning things that I just accepted as I read the book.<br/><br/>One thing about this movie is that people tend to love it or hate it. People who hate the movie can't follow the unusual plot, can't sympathize with the cast of hit men and prostitutes and abhor the violence.<br/><br/>I think a good metaphor for this is Hartigan's blood. In the movie, his blood is colored bright white just like in the black and white comics, with no shading at all. A normal viewer sees this white stuff like bird poop spewing out of him and thinks, ""Wow, that's lame."" But someone who takes an artistic point of view sees that weird blood and may feel puzzled, then decides ""Well, maybe I'm not *supposed* to be looking at the blood."" Then they move on and go with the movie. As much as fanboys criticize people who dislike the movie--and I used to be one of them--both points of view are valid.<br/><br/>So, if you have a strong stomach and can tolerate style, this should be great. :)"
"aliasanythingyouwant","Null","0","2","22 May 2005"," Medievalism in Modern Guise
","Sin City is Gothic-pulp-noir, a grab-bag of pop-culture echoes from Chandler's Philip Marlowe books to Batman to Dick Tracy to the films of Jacques Tourneur and Anthony Mann. It takes archetypes from all over fiction, processes them through a comic-book-geek imagination and out-puts a gallery of grotesques: Rondo Hatten-like freaks with righteous streaks, broken-down old cops, Amazonian warrior-hookers in the latest S&M fashions, cannibal murderers with glasses that hide their eyes like Marcy from Peanuts. It is probably the most complete attempt ever at capturing the graphic style of comic-books, the extreme angles, the dramatic sense of contrast, the splashes of vivid color (across mostly black-and-white images in this case). It is the kind of movie that CGI connoisseurs live for, one they can watch frame-by-frame like Renaissance scholars scrutinizing an endless series of Da Vincis. It has more T&A in it than anything you're going to see this side of a full-on porn film (or a Lindsay Lohan video). It is, in short, a dork's wet-dream.<br/><br/>It takes place in a fictional amalgam of every sordid metropolis in every dime-novel, B-movie or comic book ever created, a gothed-out hell-hole of dank alleys and seedy strip-clubs where people drive around in gaudy '50s cars, dress like models in a Gaultier show and talk like Sam Spade with Tourette's. This makes the film sound very atmospheric, but the goth-noir ambiance can only be described as strikingly artificial. The back-drop is stunningly rendered but the mood is purely second-hand. The influences have been processed and re-processed, like microwave fish-sticks, and the result is something that's not only bad for you, it doesn't even taste that good. There's enticing cinematic junk-food like Spider Man, a giddy anti-gravity act with an eye-popping color-scheme, then there's Sin City which might seem appetizing at first but quickly goes stale. This is no surprise for a film directed by Robert Rodriguez, whose work has always been characterized by a sense of visual histrionics that precludes the germination of anything resembling an underlying spirit. Rodriguez's debut feature, El Mariachi, was amusing but vapid, and since then his work has stopped being amusing. His failure to wring so much as an ounce of genuine atmosphere out of Sin City pretty much closes the door on the possibility of the guy ever living up to the talent he apparently possesses. It takes more than an eye for comic-book staging and frantic movement to be a filmmaker. It takes a deeper connection to the material, the setting, the characters, a connection Rodriguez has never succeeded in making.<br/><br/>The only unifying spirit evinced in Sin City is one of sadism, a reveling in cruelty and dismemberment that resembles the glee a child might feel at plucking the wings off an insect. The frenzied approach to violence is pure Rodriguez, but the deeper fixation on torture, mutilation and female imperilment reeks of a purely adolescent sensibility, and must surely be attributed to Frank Miller whose graphic-novels form the basis of the film. The attitude toward women is particularly telling. On the surface the film's Amazon-hooker characters, played by tough-cookie types like Rosario Dawson, might seem to represent the new modern archetype of the ass-kicking chick, but peel back the surface and you discover an approach to femininity that is as backward as anything in the whole pre-feminist world of distressed damsels and Lois Lane types. The story, a Pulp Fictionesque non-linear affair, is a compendium of situations where strong men are called upon to rescue and/or avenge women who have been wronged, violated or otherwise cuffed around. Miller might think he's being radical by populating his story with independent-minded prostitutes referred to as ""valkyries,"" but the situations play out in ways that reveal these women as little more than props in a sick, masturbatory fantasy of male power. The fierce personalities given these women do nothing to disguise the fact that they are little more than helpless victims to be saved from the clutches of evil, characters with no more dimension to them than Princess Toadstool from the Mario games. Even Rosario Dawson, the fiercest of the fierce, winds up clutching Clive Owen in a pose familiar from every anachronistic adventure story where women are only kept around as trophies to be won. The film oozes old-fashioned chauvinism; and it oozes sadism too. The violence is strikingly heartless and, what's more, humorless. In Kill Bill Tarantino reveled in the staging of carnage, in exploring the rhythmic and poetic potential of violent action; in Sin City Miller and Rodriguez revel in violence for violence's sake. The staging is unsophisticated compared to Tarantino's. Even at its most over-the-top Kill Bill was still funny, but when Sin City goes overboard it descends into the shallow psychotic vehemence of a video game. The tone is not just dark, it's regressive.<br/><br/>If there's anything redeeming in Sin City it's the acting. Mickey Rourke savors the role of a deformed avenger like a dog chewing on a juicy bone, while Bruce Willis brings his particular brand of world-weary virtue to the standard tired-old-cop character. Whatever soul these characters have is purely a function of the actors playing them and not the conception. Whatever personality Sin City can claim is provided via glimmers of performance sneaking through the seamlessly overwhelming visual design, the sexism, the sense of adolescent psychosis splashed all over the screen."

","I really like the idea of a film noir set in a big city. While the film looks great in its gray and silver with occasional color, I just didn't like the story.<br/><br/>The violence is WAY over the top as you would expect from Terentino. If you saw Kill Bill, you know what to expect.<br/><br/>But overall, the story or should I say STORIES within this movie are confusing and somewhat boring. The idea that some of the characters have this super human strength is OK, but it is never really explained. I also didn't like the idea of the typical psycho pervert killer with the women. It basically ripped off the story of Silence of the Lambs again, and didn't do it anywhere near as well.<br/><br/>But to the movies credit it did have some moments and was well made."

","Yes, the scenery is nice, the atmosphere is cool, the actors do a greater job in front of blue screens on this movie than others on other blue screen movies do (wink, wink).<br/><br/>However, the movie has a fundamental flaw: the final wrap up. There is none. We watch 3 disconnected stories for more than 2 hours and at the end there is only a teasing that these stories have something in common. But they don't have much in common, after watching the movie, they still feel disconnected, even if the characters are somewhat connected.<br/><br/>The movie would have been even more successful if there was a major twist at the end, a twist that connects all 3 stories together *without* the viewer expecting it.<br/><br/>Other than that, it's a good... violent movie.

"GavAnderson","10","0","1","14 May 2005"," A dark and brutal film noir that will shock, disturb, entertain, and impress
","Sin City is an outstanding comic book series influenced by classic film noir, and written and illustrated by Frank Miller. Sin City the movie, co-directed by Miller and Robert Rodriguez captures all the elements that made the comics great, stays true to the comic book style, and ultimately creates one of the best films of 2005. Shot entirely against a green screen, it draws us into the dark and surreal world of Sin City, bringing the characters and places to life with astonishing success. The cast are perfect; they really look like their characters, and are all superb in their roles. The intelligent use of colour adds a new and pleasant touch to millers work, and the disjointed chronology helps get the pace just right. If you're a fan of the graphic novels, then you are guaranteed to be pleased by the film and even if you've never read a Sin City comic in your life, you will still have plenty of enjoyment out of the film."
"mottaboy66","9","0","1","13 May 2005"," Good clean violent fun!
","With the slew of second rate comic-to-movie adaptations that Marvel has been churning out, it's a wonder more and more people haven't caught on and realized that comic books have their own format that simply can't be translated to movies that well. Luckily director Robert Rodriguez realized that it would be stupid to try and change one of his favorite series of comic books: Frank Miller's ""Sin City"", in order to bring it to the silver screen. Instead he simply copied Miller's graphic novels down to the exact detail in cinematic form, bringing the stories to life in all their grizzly glory. I knew nothing about Miller's work or about the Sin City universe going into the movie, but I was still blown away by it. I remember coming out from the theater not only impressed by the technical achievements the film managed to pull off, but also floored by the dark yet sinisterly wicked stories and dialogs that Miller came up with. The cast is littered with big names and familiar faces, from Bruce Willis (playing his typical hardened old cop role) to Mickey Rourke playing the rough and tough street fighter Marv, a character that I for one think everyone wishes they could be just like. Jessica Alba stars as the main eye candy of the film, though I found myself more drawn to the duel Kill Bill sword wielding samurai valkyrie chick Miho in all honesty. As for Benicio Del Toro, what can I say? Johnny Depp had to have been their first choice for a character that inevitably ends up as a severed head, but he makes a good second. So what can you expect from ""Sin City""? A gritty underground universe; a great deal of insightful dialog and interior monologues; and a whole lot of killing and blood. The successful emulation of Miller's comic book style is a testament to the director's awesome cinematographic skills, and the actors all put their best feet forward. BOTTOM LINE: This has to be the first time a comic book has been successfully been adapted to the big screen. This movie has everything: cops and robbers, grunt brawlers, sexy warrior women, Nazis, ninja wolf boys, corrupt politicians, hit men, talking dead men and yellow bastards. Check it out if you want some juicy, stylish entertainment."

","Although beautiful isn't exactly the word I'd use to describe the state of the city, the corruption, the framing and all that, the movie was shot beautifully. Probably the best thing about this movie is that it follows the comics almost word for word page for page. There was only one part that was edited out of the movie, and it wasn't anything significant (Marv visits his mother in the comic before visiting Claire). The only downsides that I found were that the stories are barley intertwined and the beginning doesn't have anything to do with the rest of the movie. They do connect but on a very small level. Overall this movie is worth seeing in theaters, if it's still in one of your theaters. Great acting, nice use of the random color effect. Go see it now."

","PROS: GREAT VISUAL PRESENTATION W/ EXCELLENT USE OF ARTISTIC B/W FX, SOLID - BUT NOT PERFECT - PERFORMANCES, VERY CAPTIVATING STORY...<br/><br/>CONS: NONE WHATSOEVER<br/><br/>""Sin City"" was a great movie, no, a SUPERB movie. <br/><br/>The best thing about it was its visual presentation. Everything from the movie's trademark black-and-white color scheme (with some color here and there) packs a PUNCH... who knew this artistic style could deliver such an effect? It's something straight out of a comic book, and fits the dark tone of the story very well, but accentuates style and emphasizes elements that add substance to the dark and ugly side of Sin City - blood, the yellow in the Yellow Bastard's face, etc.<br/><br/>And the performances, were they up to par with the visual effects? I'm glad to say that they were. I particularly admired Benicio del Toro's acting because his expressions were perfect for his character, but everybody else did better than average also. I'm a bit disappointed with Jessica Alba, however, but her role as a stripper tends to make you not care about how she acts... after all, 50% of what makes this movie tick is all in the visuals.<br/><br/>The story moved at an enjoyable and action-filled pace. There will never be a dull moment for anyone watching this, because the characters, setting, and plot all work together for some pretty enjoyable entertainment. It' nice to see that there are different stories here, all representing different aspects of Sin City, and they transition and blend seamlessly. Only ""PULP FICTION"" has done better.<br/><br/>So, if you're looking for a good time at the cinemas, I recommend ""Sin City"" highly - it's a beautiful flick."
"Antagonisten","8","0","1","10 May 2005"," Amazing
","It's not often, but once in a while when i watch a movie i feel that i'm watching something truly unique. And that is one of the most rewarding things that can happen while watching a movie. ""Sin City"" is unique.<br/><br/>It's hard to know where to start when reviewing this movie. It's really something that has to be experienced. And i can immediately say that it will certainly not be for everyone. It's broken-up storyline, it's excessive violence and comic-book style hardly suits everyone. But for me it was a feast for the eyes.<br/><br/>And ""a feast for the eyes"" is also the first impression as well as the lasting one. How insanely well-made the visuals are in this movie. Every frame of the movie is just so incredibly well-made and thought out. The elegant use of color vs. black-and-white, the comic-book hues. Everything about Sin City just looks amazing.<br/><br/>The second lasting impression for me was the acting. Sometimes, once in a rare while, directors manage to get the absolute best out of their actors. This is one of those times. Bruce Willis, Mickey Rourke, Clive Owen, Nick Stahl.. I could really mention all of the cast because they all perform wonderfully. It just seems like every single actor was so well tuned into the project that it was natural for them to act the way they do. Outstanding.<br/><br/>Last but not least, the third lasting impression is just how violent this movie is. I'm usually no fan of excessive violence, simply because there is seldom a need for it. Here though it's done with more style and flare than in most cases and i wasn't really bothered with it. Also the use of colors lessen the effect, giving it all the more of the comic-book feeling.<br/><br/>Trying to summarize this review is not easy. This is an outstanding movie in my opinion. I wouldn't rate it as the best i've seen this year, but by far the most interesting. I would also have to say that it's perhaps the best comic-book adaption i've seen to date, which is to say a lot considering how many such movies have come out in the last few years. The movie rises above the competition not least because it really feels like a comic-book. I was very much reminded of the computer game ""Max Payne"" myself. Both that game and this movie capitalizes on just how atmospheric a comic book can be.<br/><br/>In the end this is a beautiful, amazingly stylish, wonderfully acted movie. It guards it's comic-book roots carefully and makes the most of them. The directing felt sensitive and with a definite fingertip feeling. One of the movie experiences of this year for sure. I rate it 8/10."
"richbin","8","0","1","9 May 2005"," Dark Novel Comes to life
","When taken in with the expectation of seeing a Dark Graphic Novel come to life, this movie delivers a solid 10 out of 10. From the cinematography to its time-line, its traditional film-noir mix of modern and gangster-era clichés and its testosterone-laden action, it delivers exactly what it promises, in spades.<br/><br/>However. A caveat.<br/><br/>As a movie for the casual viewer who is out to appreciate an action thriller, touted as a comic book come to life, it tends to confuse more than explain, to rely on a viewers' desire to absorb the visual feelings incited rather than analyze the content or the flow of action. Plot holes larger than a fleet of Mac trucks, with dialog as formulaic and stilted as a pulp novel, a richer script would have contributed immensely to the movie. Although the characters in the movie undergo ludicrous amounts of punishment (DieHard? Predator? The heroes in those movies were wusses compared to the 'real men' in this movie), this element actually contributes to the tone early on - every male teenagers' dream of being invincible and unstoppable; vengeance given life, justice given breath.<br/><br/>I, personally, got everything I expected out of this movie. The objectification of women was overly prevalent, albeit somewhat counterbalanced by their obvious power, however mitigated that might be through their surrender to the men in their lives.<br/><br/>The violence, the action, the stark imagery and striking iconography were perfect for this movie. The only ways I could see fit to make this movie better would be to have had a tad better script with a little more emphasis on certain characters' past lives, to stretch their two-dimensional portraits a little more over a wire-mesh frame. The Black and White and Gray on the screen is reflected in the souls of the shadows upon it - so devoid of color as to be washed out colorless. The 'heroine' should at least have had color. More consistency regarding the world environment would have pleased me more, as would a tad more pain evidenced by the victims of violence, both from heroic and villainous sources.<br/><br/>The more I review this movie, the higher the rating climbs. I had best stop now. A Solid Graphic Novel Experience that hit the mark solidly, but which could have stood another 3 to 6 months of writing development. Outstanding direction, editing and framing. A must see."

","The two things that shine out from this visually dazzling comic-strip adaptation is Robert Rodriguez absolute requirement to collaborate with someone else and the return of Mickey Rourke.<br/><br/>Much will be written here about the brilliance of the movie with its shimmering high-contrast black & white cinematography spattered with moments of vivid color, but my focus is on Rodriguez and Rourke. Ever since he blazed onto the screen with El Mariachi, Rodriguez has regularly disappointed with his one-man-show flicks. He writes, directs, shoots, edits, composes, makes the coffee etc., and most of his movies. The subsequent disaster was encompassed in Once Upon A Time In Mexico - a sacrilegious title in itself for the dross that it was.<br/><br/>It seems evident now that for all of Rodriguez individual brilliance, he needs a collaborator to fuse the magic together. And it is no coincidence that Sin City is a masterpiece of modern cinematic flair and narrative when Rodriguez allows himself to work closely with Creator Frank Miller and no doubt have best pal Quentin on hand to bounce and share ideas with. This is easily his best film so far, and his best since his other Quentin collaboration From Duisk Till Dawn.<br/><br/>With Mickey Rourke, we have the return of a hero. He was the man to replace Brando as the King. The fact that he self-destructed is an indictment on fame and Hollywood. But there is no question that Rourke was and remains one of the truly great talents. Had he died after his 1st 3 roles a la James Dean, he would be bigger and more revered than Dean himself.<br/><br/>Here, albeit with outlandish prosthetics to conceal his own, Rourke roars into the character Marv who vows to avenge the death of a hooker called Goldie, his scratchy whiskey-soaked voice narrating the scenes with a growling drawl that Willis, Del Toro, and especially the weak Clive Owen can only dream of.<br/><br/>The film is superb.

","This might be one of the more unique film experiences one will have this year. I say that because the movie,which is rife with all the conventions of the Quentin Tarrantino/Robert Rodriguez genre,has one major distinction about it:It is entirely filmed inside of a green-screened sound-stage in Texas.<br/><br/>The title summary is about the best way to describe it: It is a combination of very retro styles,combined with more current sensibilities(i.e.full frontal-nudity,explicit violence,quirky dialogue). There are so many name actors in this film that one almost would be led to believe that the producers and directors of the film were lacking confidence in how it would stand on its own merits. <br/><br/>One would be wrong however. The acting in this film,primarily Bruce Willis as Hartigan,the single-minded,hardened cop,Mickey Rourke as MArv,the grizzled violent beast of a man who knows he is being unjustly framed for a murder of someone he loved(albeit briefly),Clive Owen as Dwight,an ex-con who seems to have more conscience than the cops or even the prostitutes he has sworn to protect,Rosario Dawson as Gail,the unofficial leader of the prostitutes who becomes Dwight's lover,and Jessica Alba as NAncy,the ""skinny,bookish girl""whom HArtigan saved before and must save again from a deranged killer. These five give very stirring performances to back up the cash value of the superb art direction,clever storytelling and nifty use of violence to accent this offering from Rodriguez and graphic novel creator and co-director Frank Miller.<br/><br/>I must warn people that this film is NOT for everyone.I know that phrase is bandied about with many movies,but this movie is almost a definitive of that phrase,as the themes and images of this movie are most certainly unsettle anyone with no taste or patience for their entertainment being both rugged and cartoonish simultaneously.

","""Sin City"" is a loathsomely gorgeous creation, perhaps the most brutally depraved concept to audaciously deem itself an aesthetic piece of art- it's a harrowing portrait of the decadence of a grotesque criminal underworld, supplanting elements of gore and vengeance for congenial cinematic structure, yet dare I castigate the film for those reasons- rather, it's a disgustingly beautiful contrivance of most ingenious proportions. ""Sin City"" is a dazzlingly bleak portrait of a truly grimy universe: bang, bang, slash, slash, yeah baby, yeah, bang, bang, etc. Instead of reducing itself to a formulaic, machismo gore fest, ""Sin City"" transcends its depravity into aesthetic, artistic brilliance- adhering to an atmosphere of darkness with obscure shading, and punctuating elements of ugliness, aberration, and awfulness with assorted hues, and the effect is that the depravity and vileness that constitute ""Sin City"" are more gorgeous and delectable elements than ever, and one develops a guilty satiation for otherwise deplorable and odious content. In ""Pulp Fiction"" chronology, it tells three dismal, grotesque stories of vengeance involving many scathing, loathsome people (all of whom are destined to the road to perdition if they haven't already visited there) and as we find ourselves immersed in a decaying world of murder, lust, mayhem, and redemption, there is an undeniable intoxication about the style that makes the entire ""grueling"" experience nothing less than deadly gorgeous eye candy, and this is sheer cinematic greatness, if nothing else. Make no bones about it, the film is not content to be sensitive to its grisly subject matter, and never compromises vile obscenity and lascivious sexual puns in its dialog, nor mortifying, nauseating violence, nor bare flesh nudity (whether bewitching or bestial), because ""Sin City"", for better or for worse, is unabashed to its nature, and faithfully exacerbates its graphic content into naked, blemished art for the inquisitive, lustful eye. The grizzly narrative will give you a good idea of the characters' senses as well as the theme, if you haven't already registered that this is about as drably noir as they come. Performances are polished to perfection, and each actor reserves dimensions to otherwise one-dimensional characters (Mickey Rourke is pitch-perfect at conveying angst and machismo, yet mortifying grief and apprehension in his relentless pursuit of vengeance, while Benicio Del Toro (head attached) is sneeringly villainous and charming, and Bruce Willis carries the persona of a hit-man with a heart of gold), in three cleverly united stories of vengeance that all culminate in despair for each. A truly deplorable concept of a film, highlighted by discomposed heads, repulsive flesh, grisly murder and mayhem- all electrified as one uncannily gorgeous creation that solidifies itself as a true cult classic delivering all the luscious eye candy and noir that film buffs will be salivating over, and then some. Who would've imagined a world of ugliness and filth could be so wholesomely glittering with beauty and genius? Frank Miller and Robert Rodriguez have realized just that with this marvelous ""Sin City"", certainly worth an engaging trip to the dark side of humanity- and beauty. **** out of ****"

","Just to tell you, I'm not a fan of the comic books, but I do plan on reading them soon. I went into the movies with high expectations, simply because Robert Rodriguez doesn't really do bad films, expect Spy Kids 3D, but that's besides the point. <br/><br/>I thought this film would be grand thing, and it turned out to be an awesome experience in many perspectives. Although the entire plot of the film wasn't very ""intuned,"" I loved the telling of three different stories all intertwined in one. <br/><br/>From the very first scene with ""The Man,"" telling looking at the girl on the balcony,telling her the those perfect lines, kissing her, then popping one in her stomach. I thought to myself, that's friggin' sick! But at the same time, I knew what type of film this was gonna be, and I was already loving it. <br/><br/>I really felt bad for Hartigan too, who seemed to just wanna make life the best for Nancy. Poor Marv, who was a no one a loser who was loved by a beautiful, sweet woman, and all Marv did was prove how much he felt her love. Dwight was an okay guy, had more lust in him than love, but he did manage to protect all his women. And Kevin, I think that was the sick creeps name, gave me the creeps. And the entire Basin City was just a sick place, with all the rapes and killings and the violent characters. <br/><br/>I enjoyed all the narratives, and all the shots that the movie had. I also enjoyed the acting, considering some movies shot all on green screen are badly acted (Sky Captain). And I enjoyed the talkiness of the film, very film noir, old gangster like. The violence could have been a little less graphic, I admit, but hey it's all just a movie. <br/><br/>If there will be a sequel, I'm not sure it'll be as good, because this one is so impressive and shocking. I enjoyed the film, and kudos for Mr. Rodriguez who really impressed me with doing such a good job on the writing of the screen story, the computer effects, the music (although it could have been more jazzy) and the direction."
"sarastro7","5","0","2","27 April 2005"," Well-made? Yes. Impressive? Yes. Great? No.
","I am a comic collector, and while I never really liked Sin City (just not my sort of thing), I have read some of it, and know what it's like. In terms of the type of story, the type of characters and the type of storytelling, the movie is (and was supposed to be) pretty much *exactly* like the comic. Everything I didn't like about the comic, I didn't like about the movie, either. This is mainly the sadism parts, and the rather bleak view of humanity.<br/><br/>Still, I was impressed with the way the characters from the comic were fleshed out by such big-name actors (particularly Jessica Alba, Rosario Dawson and Elijah Wood). Stylistically, it was an interesting exercise, and I also liked the fact that quite a lot happened. In most recent comics, nothing much happens per issue, due to the extremely annoying post-modern trend of ""decompressed storytelling"". But a lot happened here, and that was quite satisfying.<br/><br/>The city of hookers who protected themselves with all manners of weaponry (incl. a bloody ninja!) was very hard to take seriously in any way. It was quite ridiculous; if they had that kind of power, why be hookers in the first place? (I don't think it was a misogynist movie, though - I didn't see any proof of that. Perhaps a good deal of rather pathetic male chauvinist wishful thinking, but that's not misogyny.)<br/><br/>More generally speaking, I have to say I question the wisdom of attempting to do a movie which is so close to the comic as this one was supposed to be. Comics and movies are different media. This stark black&white style in a movie suggests a kind of stilted surrealism for its own sake, rather than the powerful and atmospheric messages conveyed by the art style in the comic. A voice-over in a movie just doesn't make it out for a text caption in a comic. Both the comic and the movie use the style to distance the reader/viewer from the starkness of the violence, but in the movie it is much more in-your-face because the story is live-action. Although this is in many ways an impressive movie, it was not one I particularly enjoyed, nor one that I particularly care to see again. But it was well-made and beautifully stylized; these things are undeniable.<br/><br/>My rating: 7 out of 10."
"socatranceformer","Null","0","1","24 April 2005"," A Moving comic book
","I'm not going to analyze this movie based on its story, because why you would want to take my opinion on something like that is beyond me.<br/><br/>I will look at its artistic sense. We've seen a huge slew of comic books(and video games) gone movie recently. Xmen, spiderman, Punisher, daredevil, electra, LXG, and the list goes on.<br/><br/>But all of these movies above are live action versions of the comic book. All of them fail to achieve what Sin City does, which is bringing real life animation, while still reminding you that it's a graphic novel. The use of black and white photography, with such comic book style faces is amazing. Elijah Wood's character looking like an evil charlie brown w/ glasses was kinda creepy.<br/><br/>What really made the movie was how everything was so stylized. I'm not a huge fan of senseless violence, but when it's so obviously fabricated and fictionalized like in Sin City, it's just so much better. It's unfortunate that this movie most likely will not win, or even be nominated for academy awards, which it would definitely be in contention for in make-up, direction, and cinematography."
"higeswhiskers","8","0","1","24 April 2005"," One Of My Favorites
","What if there was a city where crime was accepted? Where hookers controlled one side of the city, and police controlled the other? There is no justice without sin, and that is the point of Frank Miller's Sin City.<br/><br/>Three intertwining tales of love, deceit, betrayal, and death are the segments told in Sin City. In one of the three, a brute feels the need to exact revenge on the people that killed the woman he loved and also framed him for the murder of her. In the second, a man and a group of hookers must try to prevent a war from erupting between them and the mafia. In the third, and final, story, an ex-police officer must protect an exotic dancer from a yellow madman.<br/><br/>The three main characters are Marv, an unstoppable hulk, Dwight, a man who must deal with a dead cop's body or have all Hell break loose, and Hartigan, an ex-cop who must protect an exotic dancer from an insane congressman's child-molesting son. Of course, there are other characters: Nancy, the exotic dancer who, over eight years, falls in love with Hartigan; Gail, the leader of the hookers and Dwight's love interest; Kevin, the cannibal that killed the only woman that Marv loved; Jackie-Boy, the maniac police officer; Yellow Bastard/Junior, the psychopath who plans to kill Hartigan and impregnate Nancy; and the enigmatic Businessman, who is a hit-man.<br/><br/>The genre is mostly action for Sin City. Even though the film is graphic (severed heads and limbs at every corner, and don't forget the excessive gun play), all of the violence is justified, and isn't just there for shock value, which is what I thought when I went to watch it the first time (for I've seen it twice). Upon watching it the second time, the violence did seem excessive, but some of it was still enjoyable (a character is shot through the chest with an arrow, points at it, and says, ""Hey, look at this! Ow, that really hurts."").<br/><br/>So, now I must tell you my closing thoughts for Sin City. Well, what can go wrong when Michael Madsen and Nick Stahl are part of the supporting cast, and Bruce Willis, Clive Owen, and Mickey Rourke make-up the main cast? As I stated above, the actions are justified, and all of the characters are well-rounded and believable. I've heard of a Sin City 2 in production already staring Johnny Depp, and after seeing Sin City, I would see the sequel in a heartbeat. I was blown-away by the stories, the cast, and the special effects in the movie and would gladly see Sin City a third time.<br/><br/>My Grade: 97%"
"psychofarm-1","9","0","1","24 April 2005"," Cartoon movie with intricate plot and Sex and Violence
","The plotting of this film is quite complex, which makes for a very intriguing storyline. Because of the ""comic book"" like staging, it is sometimes tricky to figure out where you are in the story. Given the intense violence, the black and white comic look probably saved this film from an NC-17 rating. The women in this movies are very comic book with well-developed bosoms prominently displayed, just like what you see in comic book images (think ""Heavy Metal"" cartoon). The male leads are very well done with Mickey Rourke perhaps the best. All of the characters are highly stylized. A tad long, but manages to sustain interest throughout."
"Robert_duder","7","0","1","24 April 2005"," Unique and WAY OUT there!!
","I knew NOTHING of Frank Miller, or his graphic novels but this film was packed full of Hollywood elite including one of my faves in Bruce Willis. If nothing else can be said about this film it's UNIQUE!! There is little to nothing else like it in it's style. It's perhaps one of the most intriguing comic book adaptations. It had it's shortcomings, in my opinion, but I found myself just glued to my seat completely captivated by it's look and style and even the over the top confusing story.<br/><br/>To describe the plot of Sin City would be more confusing than it's worth. Sin City is a collection of interwoven stories focusing on three main characters played by Bruce Willis, Clive Owen, and Mickey Rourke. The film basically aims to immerse you in Sin City's world, it doesn't attempt to bring you up to speed, or give you any background but literally drops you into the action and lives of these characters. Bruce Willis is a cop who thwarts a kidnapping committed by a senator's son and goes to prison for a crime that he didn't commit. Upon release he is determined to protect the girl that was kidnapped 11 years earlier. Mickey Rourke plays a messed up thug who's true loves dies in bed with him and he hell bent on vengeance for her murder and Clive Owen plays a ladies man photographer who, together with his lady friend, kills the cities finest and most corrupt cop and must cover it up to stop the gang war of all gang wars between Cops, Mob and the ladies.<br/><br/>Interwoven throughout these plots are other subplots that at times make no sense but they aren't meant to really. The first sign of confusion is the direction team...any time you have Robert Rodriguez, and Quentin Tarantino together you've got one confusing mish mashed film. Fortunately for Sin City, it has the backing of an amazing cast, and drop dead amazing special effects and probably the support of Frank Miller to stop it from being say...Pulp Fiction (yes I hated Pulp Fiction, get over it.) The film is also brutally Tarantino violent although it's more artistic than gory being on the black and white backdrop. All three main stars are brilliant, dark, creepy, and watchable. Mickey Rourke is the shining point as the brooding, misunderstood hulk of a man Marv. He's mean, he's huge and yet you can't help but feel sympathetic for him. It's the best role I've ever seen Rourke in and he's barely recognizable as Marv. The downsides are indeed the mish mashed plot because there just isn't anything memorable about how it plays out. It's too confusing even with the upsides. Not all of us, probably a majority haven't read the graphic novels so we know nothing about it. The film leaves us wanting more back story which might be a nice play to turn this into a franchise but I felt like I wanted Sin City to be a TV Series so there was more immediately. Kudos to casting for bringing together some of Hollywood's biggest stars they all did well. I hope to see more of Sin City in the future so I can find out more of the intriguing back story.<br/><br/>7/10"

May be no because it is not glorified. After all, in this dark city, there is some light: Marv wants to revenge the death of the only girl who made him feel something he never felt in his whole life despite his ugliness.

","There's no denying that visually Sin City is a ride- a very violent one. Rodriguez makes a film that has a Tarantino-esquire feel but is somehow markedly different from the latter's work.<br/><br/>What makes the film great is not only the direction and cinematography, but the three main leads- Willis, Rourke, and Owen do incredible jobs, arguably some of their best work. Elijah Wood and Nick Stahl deserve some recognition too for taking a chance on edgier roles- to say that these two are playing against type is an understatement. Rosario Dawson, Michael Clark Duncan, and Benicio del Toro are great as always. The only off-key performance is from Alba- sure, she's hot, but she is a second-rate actress.<br/><br/>Nonetheless, Sin City is a dazzling meld of film noir, ultraviolent pulp, and Frank Miller's uncanny comic series."
"Extinctive","8","0","1","23 April 2005"," Dreamy display of revenge and violent power
","This movie is quite the project, visually. Everone will notice that. And even though I really don't like violence all that much, this time it seems a means to a goal, to deliver it to the viewer in its purest darkest form. It will touch your instincts because it's just so strong and in your face. The main characters are living for tough and hard action, and they all have comic-book strength. Frank Miller's writing for the narration is uniquely macho, honest and primal, which made it very funny at times, and I very much liked his message; Men who hurt (or kill) women should not be left unpunished, they deserve the worst revenge we men can possibly think of.<br/><br/>It is almost as if Miller used his writing to get even with every wish for (and dream about) revenge he might have collected during his lifetime. Sin City is the realization of vengeance. In fact, the entire film reminded me a lot of Payback (with Mel Gibson), which is highly underrated (seeing the appreciation Sin City gets).<br/><br/>The only reason this movie didn't get my maximum rating is because I thought 2 of the actors (Clive Owen and Michael Clarke Duncan) were badly cast for their parts. They ruined the power this movie could have had. They softened it up, changed it from gaining cult-status to being just another attempt at replicating stuff like Payback and Spider Man. Either way, it's a movie everyone should see, also those who will hate it after-wards. It could be seen as educational, even. Everybody should know there are people around who can write 'sick' stories like these, and that there are so many people on this planet who will like them."
"olchowski","10","0","2","23 April 2005"," This movie is an instant classic
","I am a long time comic fan so I wanted to like this movie. I think that actually makes me a tougher critic. The movie making process involves so many creative people and so many economic compromises that it is rare when a unique artistic vision makes it to the screen intact. Well, this time it happened. Frank Miller's vision is up there on the big screen just the way it played in your head when you read the books. And if you are not into graphic novels- the Sin City books are absolutely not your fathers (meaning me) comic books-this movie is a perfect introduction to an under-appreciated art form. It is wonderful to see a movie that the creative team wanted to make rather than the a movie that the marketing team thinks you want to see. The story follows the low lives of Basin City as the consequences of corruption and madness play out. This is Mikey Spillane times ten. The guys are tougher and the dames are tougher and I bet even the pets are tougher than anyone you ever thought of. The movie rating is well earned with enough flying body parts to perplex a team of trauma surgeons, but none of it is as gratuitous and stupid as the average teenage slasher epic. Micky Rourke delivers an outstanding performance, as well as one of the all time best tough guy lines. Bruce Willis, Clive Owen, the ladies and the whole cast are terrific. You need to see this movie."
"mayankmandava","10","0","2","23 April 2005"," The all or nothing days.... they're back!
","""WOW!"" Sin City demands that you say that at every step of the way. the gravel blowing car chases, the film noir dialogs, the amplified gun shots, the style, the multiple castrations.... all the elements add up to a movie that is an example of both high art and i-wanna-watch-it-again-and -again entertainment. It calls to mind many things... Pulp fiction(the three slightly connected stories), Kill Bill (the blood and oh-so satisfying violence), Desperado (the cool kills and real men), James Hadly Chase(the cooldbloodedness of it) and all the 20's and 30's detective movies you ever saw. <br/><br/>But Sin City is quite unique. You have never seen a movie quite like it. The characters are brilliant. Almost all the characters fit the bill so nicely that i would not have any of them replaced by anyone else. But a special mention to Mickey Rourke as Marv who takes the cake for the big psycho we all love.<br/><br/>At the end of the movie you wont feel touched emotionally. But that was one thing that I am sure Frank Miller never tried to achieve. What you do feel is satisfied. You feel like living in the days when you could walk down a street with a gun in one hand, a knife in the other and a cigarette in your lips. The all or nothing days.... <br/><br/>I read the comics immediately after I saw the movie and again saw the movie immediately after i read the comics. The adherence is unbelievable. Almost no dialog has been altered and almost every scene is lifted right out of the frame of the comic-book. You can keep the comic book and the movie frame beside each other and play spot the difference and lose. In my opinion though the movie does much more justice to the over-sized men and lethal prostitutes than a graphic novel ever can. You have to hear the bones cracking to catch the entire effect."

It almost felt like the movie was that fat kid in school that beat you up by sitting on your chest until recess ended.<br/><br/>The performances were great. The films layout and choreography were so skillfully put together that you could print out each frame and hang it as a work of art.<br/><br/>The sound effects were over done and the violence was so over the top, I wondered how they didn't pick a new letter to rate this movie with. ""R"" just didn't seem like a strong enough warning.<br/><br/>I don't know how I could ever recommend this movie to anyone. Even though I liked it, I would have to give such strong disclaimers that my recommendation would sound like a warning. ""Well grandma, if you can sit through all the cannibalism, child molestation, and decapitation scenes, I think you will find the film has a lot of strong points.""<br/><br/>I took my wife to go see it and sat in fear the whole time that she was going to drag me out and into the Nicole Kidman movie next door. Lucky for me, she is an Xmen fan and was able to recognize the art and originality. But I probably wouldn't have taken her if I would have watched it first. Not exactly a ""get her in the mood"" kind of picture show."
"jsemovieman","10","0","2","22 April 2005"," INCREDIBLE-takes us into a rare cinematic dimension
","Sin City ****/out of 4<br/><br/>Comics have always been turned into films, but films have never been transformed into comics. The super hero genre of movies have included Spiderman, The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, Batman, X-Men, The Punisher, Constantine, Blade, Daredevil, The Hulk, and many others. In addition to super hero movies, many films such as American Splendor, Road to Perdition, From Hell, and Ghost World were all adapted from comics. Although some adaptations, such as American Splendor, have remained true to their comic, no film has ever accomplished what Sin City has.<br/><br/>Being someone who has read Frank Miller's Sin City comics, seeing Sin City on the big screen was like seeing a whole new type of cinema that only partially existed in the 1950s. If people say that Sin City, the movie, is just like the comics...they are wrong. Simply put, the move is the comics. Never before has a graphic novel been used completely as the actual storyboard for a film. The movie and comic are identical, line for line and shot shot. One thing that makes the film so unique is its color. It retains the black and white feel of the comic, creating a gritty and crime filled atmosphere. Also, Sin City stands as a perfect example for modern film-noir. Many directors still give their films a noir-ish feel, such as David Lynch's Mulholland Drive, Twin Peaks, and Blue Velvet, but Sin City stands as a cinematic symbol for film noir.<br/><br/>The film adaptation consists mostly of books one, three, and four. Each book is a story of a man searching for redemption, through violence and true love. Book one, The Hard Goodbye, focuses around Marv (played by Mickey Rourke). He has a one-night stand with a hooker, Goldie (Jamie King), only to find her dead the next morning. What makes The Hard Goodbye the most memorable story of Sin City is Marv's twisted, yet humorous rampage he embarks on to avenge a woman he barely knew. He has no meaning to his life, and all he has to live for is murder. The characters in The Hard Goodbye are made to look exactly like the characters in the comic. Elijah Wood turns in a creepy performance as Kevin, a local cannibal. In the third book, The Big Fat Kill, the story is centered around Dwight and his journey to and from Old Town, dealing with hookers, his lover, and the head of a cop. Clive Owen does a darkly serious job as playing Dwight (similar to his fierce role in Closer). Rosario Dawson, too, resembles all the traits of Gail, as drawn in the comic. Probably the best performance in this segment, though, is from the underrated Benicio Del Toro. He proves, once again, to completely absorb his character and puts his talented signature on the few scenes he is in. Quentin Tarantino, credited as ""special guest director"", films the segment when Owen is driving in the car with Del Toro's dead body. For those who have seen Pulp Fiction, this scene is a reminiscent of Samuel L. Jackson and John Travolta conversing in the beginning. The third story in the film, and the fourth book, is That Yellow Bastard. Bruce Willis plays Detective John Hartigan who's tracking a local child molester his last day on the job. Jessica Alba plays Nancy Callahan, the girl Hartigan saves, and his lover as well. Willis does the best job out of the whole cast, right next to Nick Stahl.<br/><br/>As Joe Williams of the post dispatch said, ""style beats substance"", and that is true indeed. Compared to other early films of 2005, like The Upside of Anger, which focus on a powerful theme, Sin City focuses much more on its look. Maybe, though, the look is the theme. Director Robert Rodriguez took on this project with Frank Miller and the final product is something remarkable. During the first ten minutes of the film I was laughing hysterically because I couldn't take ithow identical the movie was to the comics. It was almost as if I was seeing a miracle take place or a book come to life. Sin City is the first ever live-action comic book. It takes normal film-going audiences to a place they've never been before. For more than two hours it feels as if you are living inside the movie instead of watching it. There is the real world, the world of movies, and then there is Sin City. Entering the theater and watching this film is like taking a break from reality and letting your imagination soar. How has this happened? How can a film make one feel as if they're living inside a comic book? Sin City has done just that, it has revealed a true power of cinema and has taken viewers to a surreal dimension of art, and for thatSin City deserves to be a landmark."

Of course the only issue at hand is Rodriguez and Tarantino being caught up in the violent past of the 80s that is long gone... we had hoped they would have evolved to a more peaceful and spiritual place where they could actually provide entertainment on a deeper level with character development that delves deeper than some basic comic book premature sex, guns and rock n roll phase one goes thru in their teens and twenties and audiences now seek something deeper as seen in horribly directed/executed movies like What the Bleep that has great content but lacks the directing expertise of these directors.. imagine Rodriguez or Tarantino getting a hold of Indigo Children or What the Bleep and we might start to see a huge shift in Independent film making but instead they create the same shallow teenage violent movies with the same heroes of the violent 80s like Willis or Mickey who have the audacity to say that this is good acting...were talking about comic books fellas... not Shawshank Redemption or American Beauty but great job anyways since it is all done via green screen and might lend to more theatrical performances in the future... but perhaps their next project will have more substance but the movie is entertaining if u can stomach the comical endless amount of violence and blood.... and a few nudity shots that somehow got past the puritan graders which was a relief to see.<br/><br/>I gave the film an 8 mostly for execution, directing and style but Miller's comic book had a great story but lacked the depth one would want to see put into a 40M film but hey.. its cutting edge.. congrats."
"rparham","9","0","1","20 April 2005"," Revel in ""Sin""
","There are few comic book adaptations that are as faithful to the source material as Sin City. Most comic adaptations make some kind of obligatory change for reasons that range from good to nonsensical, leaving fans of the original graphic novel bemoaning the desecration of their beloved comic. Not with Sin City. Advertised by director Robert Rodriguez as a ""translation,"" Sin City replicates its inspiration impeccably, right down to individual shots matching individual panels of the original comic. But aside from slavish attention to detail, Sin City is an enormously entertaining film in its own right, recapturing some of the magic that made Pulp Fiction a runaway success.<br/><br/>Sin City is based on a series of graphic novels written and illustrated by Frank Miller, a comic creator most famous for his hard-edged take on Batman in the late 1980's with the graphic novel The Dark Knight Returns. Here, Miller has drawn on an apparent love of pulpy, hard-boiled detective and crook stories right out of the 1940's. His leads are all anti-heroes to one degree or another, his women are hookers or bar maids, the police are crooked, and violence surrounds everyone in abundance.<br/><br/>Sin City is essentially three separate stories: the first introduces us to Marv (Mickey Rourke), an ex-con with an ugly mug who gets picked up by a hooker named Goldie (Jamie King), but when Marv wakes up the next day, Goldie is dead, and Marv has been framed for the murder. So, instead of just taking it, he goes on a warpath to find the truth about Goldie's killer and lets no one stand in his way. The second story focuses on Dwight (Clive Owen), a murderer who just obtained plastic surgery to change his face. He is witness to a bar girl's boyfriend, James Rafferty (Benecio Del Toro), roughing her up and decides to take matters into his own hands. But before he can do anything, James and his crew ride into a section of the city dubbed Old Town, where the prostitutes have license to protect themselves, by any means necessary. The last story revolves around a police detective, Hartigan (Bruce Willis), who saves a little girl named Nancy from the clutches of a sadistic serial child rapist (Nick Stahl), only to end up framed for the crimes as revenge by the father of the rapist, a powerful senator (Powers Boothe). Eight years later, fearing for Nancy's safety, Hartigan manages to get released from prison and goes searching for Nancy (Jessica Alba), unaware that he is being followed by someone from his past.<br/><br/>On the visual front, Sin City is a knockout. Rodriguez, who has begun to rely more and more on advancing digital technology to craft his films, filmed most of his performers in front of greenscreens with limited props and sets and combined them with digitally rendered backgrounds. For the most part, it works beautifully. As with Miller's graphic novels, the color palate is mostly black and white, with a little color utilized, often to represent story points, or sometimes to make an emotional impact. The computer generated backgrounds are exceptional, creating a seedy, non-time-specific world of dirt, grime and dampness. By utilizing this technique, the style of the film stays relatively intact, with no jarring change from real set to digital at any point in the film. Rodriguez also frames many of his shots to one-for-one match Miller's original panels. For those not familiar with the Sin City graphic novels, this attention to detail will not be recognized, but for anyone who knows the source material, it is one extra touch that helps elevate Sin City above much of it's comic adaptation brethren.<br/><br/>Sin City lives up to its pulp roots at every turn, especially in its dialogue. At first, the film's hard boiled, very pulp-style dialogue seems jarring, unrealistic and stilted. But after a few minutes, that feeling dissipates and the dialogue flows naturally at that point. Rodriguez also does a good job of intertwining humor into the film. This is a picture that doesn't take itself too seriously, but also doesn't descend into camp.<br/><br/>The characters are mostly engaging, especially Marv. If there is any example of career resuscitation at its best, then Mickey Rourke's performance as Marv would be it. Rourke has been generally unimpressive to me for his last ten or so films, but he is a standout in Sin City. He breathes live into Marv and manages to make us care about this rather simple minded thug, finding pathos in the character. Bruce Willis and Clive Owen as the other male leads are both notable also, but they don't quite match the memorable Marv.<br/><br/>The one caveat to make about Sin City is that this is definitely not a film for everyone. It's laced wall-to-wall with graphic violence and some rather frank and explicit nudity (although never dipping towards pornography). Many people will be repulsed by its no-holds-barred attitude, but for those who enjoy this type of material, Sin City does not disappoint."

","Don't take your girlfriend to see this movie unlesss you know she is able to handle a great deal of unnecessary violence.<br/><br/>This is the bloodiest affair since Kill Bill, and the movie being mostly in black and white does not help much, it will if possible make it even more brutal. Expect to see people's head split in half, private body parts being ripped off and lots of blood pouring out all over the place.<br/><br/>If violence is a form of art, this movie would be any art museums treasure though. The movie is truly a piece of astonishing work, and it is hard not to be blended by it's beauty despite it's raw content.<br/><br/>Any of Frank Millers comic book fans will be pleased to see the movie is the most accurate expression of any comic book to date, which is quite an accomplishment in this case, Miller's books are not your average Spider Man thing, but deep and dark tales of men challenged on many complex levels.<br/><br/>The movie is entertaining, up to the point of what entertainment the comic book itself can offer. There is no real main character or hero here though, there are rather several, but the Sin City connects it all together. An interesting approach for a movie, although might put some people off.<br/><br/>All in all, the movie is a fresh gush of wind when it comes to getting a good comic book to the screen in a faithful way. If messy violence is your thing, then you will find fewer better looking wrappings around it than this one."

","Sin City is a truly extraordinary piece of film-making that astounds you with its visual flair, its tone-perfect cast and utter uniqueness. <br/><br/>Robert Rodriguez has once again, more so than ever, shown himself as a true visionary, not just in his realisation of this complex story but in his pioneering digital work.<br/><br/>It is a film that should rightly hold a place forever in history as the first that truly demonstrated what could be achieved with digital technology.<br/><br/>Like a living comic book (it really brings the comic to life in an exact translation that no comic-book film has ever captured before) with this film he has rewritten the possibilities of film-making.<br/><br/>Mickey Rourke and Benicio Del Toro stood out in an exceptional cast that was faultless. They handled the extreme delivery of very comic-book dialogue (unlike anything most directors would be brave enough to let on screen for fear of critical ridicule from the uninitiated or just those unwilling to let go of all they know about film and witness the birth of a new phenomenon) in their stride neither hamming it up nor toning it down. Even actors I am normally a little wary of like Josh Hartnett and Clive Owen put in strong performances while Elijah Wood is positively freaky.<br/><br/>The film as a whole truly infested my mind and made it impossible firstly for me to put into words how blown away by it I was but also to think about anything other than the film for several hours afterwards (I still can't shake lines and visuals from my mind a day later).<br/><br/>It's also fun to contemplate which scene Quentin Tarantino directed.<br/><br/>The use of the early, more jumping scenes was ingenious ahead of three longer narratives for initiating the style for people so that certain visuals, cartoonish laws of gravity, glorious costumery, etc didn't distract you in the main sections.<br/><br/>It is also one of those that begs to be seen over and over. It grabs you and doesn't let go almost making it impossible to take everything in. I can't wait to see it again, and own the DVD.<br/><br/>I think it is a film once seen never forgotten and even those who don't appreciate the style I am sure will see its place in history as  groundbreaking new artistry.<br/><br/>I applaud all involved and hope Rodriguez continues to make films this visceral and exciting in the future."

","With ""Sin City,"" I didn't know anything about it. A friend of mine who's obsessed with Elijah Wood wanted to go see it. I told her I'd go see it with her, but I had no opinion about it either way. Then I saw a preview. Realized I *had* to go see this film, if no other reason than the beautiful cinematography. Well, I finally saw it. I loved this film.<br/><br/>The cinematography was even more amazing than I thought it was going to be. I loved the use of the black-and-white. We just don't see enough of those anymore, and for a genre like film noir, black-and-white works well. However, it was taken a step further by the use of color in certain places, like Goldie's hair color, Dwight's car, the blood on Marv's face. These heightened the surrealness of the movie, along with the almost cartoonish look, like the first time Kevin's on the screen or Marv's bandages. This movie is stellar example of awesome cinematography! But that's not the only great thing...the music was perfect. Within the first minute or so of the opening credits, I knew I had to buy the soundtrack. The music perfectly accentuated the movie, which is what good scores are supposed to do.<br/><br/>I thought the acting in this movie was incredible. All of the actors did a great job in connecting with one another for each scene they were in. It wasn't so far over the top that it got annoying. One small thing was the way all the guys had that gruff, smoking-for-their-lives way of talking, but since that's common in film noir, it worked. Also, the voice-overs could be annoying for some. They didn't bother me, since I realized those, too, are common in film noir, and there were three different stories in this film.<br/><br/>The fight scenes were cool. I really liked watching Marv fight. While they're a little over-the-top, I was okay with it.<br/><br/>All in all, I just loved this film. I thought it was supremely awesome, and I'm planning on buying it once it's out."

","Sin City is one of my most expected movies in this year. I've read the Comics and after seeing the film I couldn't find much difference between the film and the Comics. The Colors, the Camera-settings, all is taken straightly from the Comics! Only one or two scenes were dropped in the film, but that doesn't matter! Sin City has gratefully reached the goal of making, and holding up this dark (and violent) Sin City-atmosphere, by using the b/w-Style (with some colors in it) and filling in this hammer of a Soundtrack! Apart from that, the cast couldn't be chosen better, all the Characters seem to be copied right out of the Comics. And at least to confirm: This really is the best and similar-est Comic-adaption I've seen! Finally I can say: This is Robert Rodriguez' best film ever made!"

"whartandi","7","0","1","18 April 2005"," good individual stories but ...
","I finally got to watch Sin City last weekend. Let me tell you. i was so excited. The movie posters and trailers really hyped me up with the cell shading style of the movie. Rodriguez and Miller has seamlessly blended the art of comic shaded style imagery with live action perfectly. The CG backdrop was awesome! So awesome that it made Jude Law's Sky Captain flick looked like child's play. However, as much as i loved the well crafted images and narrative story telling, i was shunned by the fact that it tells three stories one after another.<br/><br/>The most striking thing that you see in this movie is the dark sense of the movie. Rodriguez and Miller cleverly mixed dark colors like Black and White and Grey with just a few notable bright colors like the bright gold color of Goldie's hair or the bright yellow for Yellow Bastard. The individual noir style script for each stories is so well written that it blends well with the dark ambiance of the Sin City feel. Add to that the comic style shading and camera pans, and you got yourself a true unique cinema masterpiece.<br/><br/>On the down side, (now, I do realize that this is a retelling of 3 different books) and don't get me wrong either, it is a film that consist of three different stories. Each story was so well made that it kept you to the edge to your seat each time. But, hey i am a writer my self and my believe is that you need just one really good climax to a good movie and it is for a good reason. I was so excited on the first chapter about Marv but then it ends so quickly and suddenly it moved to another different story about Dwight and after that we are taken back in time for the Hartigan story and we get to see Marv again putting up a cameo in a bar. Each story moves too fast for me to feel any empathy for each character and as a story ends you find yourself trying to sympathize with a set of different characters. In my opinion Marv's story was the best and unfortunately it was the first story in the film. I am not saying that the two other stories were bad but it fell short of my expectation and to my dismay it got me disinterested.<br/><br/>In the end, i will have to commend Robert Rodriguez for pulling such an ambitious project. It is the most impressive comic stylized movie i've seen so far. Although i won't be back to watch it in the theater again, i will be sure to pick up a DVD copy. Like i said I love the first chapter but i'll skip the last two."

","To be honest I went to see Sin City almost completely in the dark on what to expect... I did a little research into the comics on line but there is only so much you can get that way. If you go to this movie expecting to see campy or tongue in cheek stuff like some comic book to screen adaptations give us you will probably be disappointed and even shocked by the dark vision that unfolds on screen. There is no hero in tights here to save everyone from the evil villain. No one in Sin City is an innocent but the anti-heroes we watch administering their own brand of justice provide some of the best action and drama I've seen on screen in a while. The film integrates black and white live action with a touch of animation and hits home on every level. Its one surprise after another right to the very end (if you haven't read the graphic novels) and I enjoyed every twist and turn"

","I should preface that I love film moire and this genre. So, when I saw it the other day I was really struck by Mickey Roarke's performance. He played one mean s.o.b. and when he promised toughness, he delivered with style. If ever a movie role was specifically geared for an individual Marv = Mickey Roarke were born to play each other. The movie, itself, was fast paced and action packed. There were some nice performances turned in by Bruce Willis, Rosario Dawson, Michael Madsen, Brittany Murphy, Benedicio del Toro, Nick Stahl and Jessica Alba...who is one sensual young woman.<br/><br/>The story involves a couple cops trying to stop a serial child rapist and murderer, who happens to be the Senator's son. The Senator is brother of the real crime lord of Sin City...the Catholic bishop who has his fingers and tongue on all things evil in Sin City. This crime lord..literally, is played by the venerable Rutger Hauer whose pet friend is the mute Elijah Wood...Frodo freaks out in this movie and plays this bizarre, mute killer that cooks his victims and shares his meals with Rutger...<br/><br/>There is definitely a battle between evil and eviler in this movie.

","I have to admit, when I first saw the poster of Jessica Alba about 5 months ago I wasn't as excited about this movie as the teenage guys working at the movie theater. Curiosity is the reason I went to see it. I must say this movie was beautiful-not the violence in it, but the brilliant splashes of color and interesting dialog. From the moment the movie began, I couldn't take my eyes away from the screen. The music made my heart pound as well as the random silhouettes throughout the movie. A few parts made my stomach turn, but overall I think that I did pretty well for 20 year old Fine Art Major. I recommend this movie to anyone but my parents!

","For Joe Schmo Viewer: Boy, this is silly, nonsensically violent (numerous people are borderline invincible), and hilarious in a grim way. It is also the best eye candy anyone who likes black and white images could ever dream of. If you don't like random religious bashing, seeing what has to be hundreds of people dying, mild cop bashing, and a few bits of female nudity, I recommend this heartily. (I can't wait to see it again, personally) For Noir Nerds: This movie is clearly modeled after INDIANA JONES: it's nostalgic, it shows the traditional Hollywood feature of having many disposable characters, which is a shame. Rodrigeuz and Tarantino did much better with El Mariachi and Pulp Fiction/Reservoir Dogs: those are smaller, more intimate stories with characters you connect with a bit more. Here, villains are set up only sothat they can be taken down in short order by sexy ""heros/anitheros"" who defy deaths better than Batman.<br/><br/>Still... well, damn it, I LIKE LOOKING AT IT! Even if the sound was off, this would be an enjoyable movie for me. A non-pc one to be sure, but enjoyable as hell. (Despite all the ""nudity"" stuff you hear, there's no full frontal stuff, which rendered the whole thing in my mind to be no worse than a trip to the beach.) I don't really think the movie degrades women any worse than Disney nonsense which portrays them as being obsessed with material goods or shallow as Satan: at least the women here have goals in life you can get behind.<br/><br/>There was some great lost potential here: too much time is spent showing the heros flashing their guns and such things: a lot better would have to show the politics behind their framings a bit better, or the female psychology of being sexually abused (as happens constantly) This movie has too much testosterone, I think that summarizes its problems.<br/><br/>Plus, what the hell was with the swastika? I recommend it to nerds, people who like black and white, horny teenagers, dirty old men, and people who fastforward to the good parts of anything."

","Sin City deserves a ten for it's look alone. It did what Sky Captain was supposed to do and made Digital Filming look better than anything ever seen by movie-goers. But, despite its visual beauty, Sin City's highest point comes from the one thing that is really on the set, the actors.<br/><br/>Without a doubt, the Best Acting all year goes to Mickey Rourke, who is brutish, tormented, and insane, and makes it look so damn good. He portrayed Marv better than Jamie Foxx portrayed Ray. Bruce Willis, while not the perfect look for Hartigan, but earns his acting chops after the dismal yet extremely different Whole Ten Yards character. Clive Owen was truly marvelous as Dwight and showed great versatility by dropping his heavy British accent. But however good the good guys are, you know it's cooler to be a bad ass bad guy. Elijah Wood will scare you to hell and back (pun intended) with his beyond creepy smile and stare. Nick Stahl is great as always as the crazed pedophile we all know and love, and Benicio Del Toro, whose character is drunk in every scene he is in, highlights the baddie section with another mind-blowing performance that blows the barrel right off the gun.<br/><br/>Robert Rodriguez has nearly kissed his chance of an Oscar goodbye after he quit the D.G.A. to do this film with Frank Miller, and all who see this piece of art should thank him for the sacrifice he made to bring us this truly remarkable film."

The display of neon-white blood was innovative. The women were beautiful (although the girl I went with commented on how the movie's vixens created a gender bias.) <br/><br/>HOWEVER, the movie lacked a real story line. The story of Sin City was actually three stories that somewhat overlapped. The stories alone, as a thirty minute episode, would have been cool, but they could not succeed all together. They were too similar. At one point, I thought that it was possible that Willis's character would end up being Marv. In reality, it was just a typical role that a few of the characters shared.<br/><br/>At no point was a surprised or shocked by a plot twist. There was potential to really tie the three main characters together, but it never happened.<br/><br/>I left the theater impressed by visuals, but disappointed overall by the movie as a whole."

The way it's done (I'm sure you all know about the B&W with bits of color) was done more selectively then I thought it'd be. I really marveled at how they used color in some scenes. It was brilliant. The three stories were all very compelling and well done. The acting was a bit cheesy but that makes the movie better because it's supposed to be. It's one of those movies that, as you're watching it, you're aware you're viewing something special. I can't wait to buy this on DVD.<br/><br/>Oh and as for the Rating: It's got a lot of breasts in the beginning, a few shots of sex, barely any profanity and a ton of violence and blood.

","I was never a fan of comic books, and an even lesser fan of comic book movies. With ""Sin City"" (oddly probably the most faithful comic book movie ever in that it adapts film to a comic book level instead of adapting a comic book to film), however, I was completely entranced. I credit the aesthetics. Whether it's the stark black and white cinematography (speckled with bright color in all the right places), or the antiquated and noirish set designs, or the clever and amusing use of make-up (especially for Mickey Rourke's lovable thug ""Marv""), or the over-abundance of gorgeous women beautifully photographed in all stages of dress and undress, there is always something to look at here. And it was my busy eyes that got me totally caught up in this beguiling world of violence, sex, revenge, dames, shady heroes, corrupt cops, slimy politicians, good-hearted whores, and more castrations and beheadings than any other film in history created by Frank Miller and Robert Rodriguez (a director who knows not the mantra of a good editor that I never really cared for).<br/><br/>Ultimately, with its roundabout episodic plot line reminiscent of ""Pulp Fiction"", the stories really amount to nothing much, but that's just fine because the blazingly original visuals give your mind more than enough to chew on. While you may not think much about the plot or characters, you'll never forget the images, and this is the true testament of a good film. Yes, a great film would have an enthralling story, too, but when it comes to the lowest base of story-telling represented by comic books and their filmed counterparts, you're not going to get any better than ""Sin City."" Bravo, they've made every comic book film that has come before it and every one that will undoubtedly and unfortunately come after it, a moot point."

","Sin City is one of the coolest movies I've seen in the last few years and although not perfect it holds up with Reservoir Dogs, Kill Bill, and even Pulp Fiction on violence and coolness. The film involves three stories, first about a man after revenge because a hooker named named Goldie gave him the night of his life is killed sleeping right next to him is killed, number 2 is about a man who goes after a bad dude but the dude ends up being a cop and unfortunately he finds this out after he kills him so they go on a pretty crazy ride to try and hide the body, and the third about a cop blamed for a crime against a little girl that a senator's son actually committed so he goes to jail and after 8 years he confesses falser to the crime and goes on parole while on parole he finds the little girl is tracked by the senators son almost killed by the son twice and has to save the girls life again. Mickey Rourke gives the best performance of the three lead actors Mickey, Bruce Willis, and Clive Owen. Mickey is certainly in the most violent of all of the stories. In his story you see a man get eaten by his own dog after having his legs and arms chopped off, a bunch of guys get cut up with an Axe, a lot of shooting and people getting shot, the main character get his face beaten to a pulp twice, and many other scenes of torcher one involving a mans face being ripped off on the pavement of the street, oh yeah and did I mention the electrocution chair scene and the sex scene and the other scene where you see the mom from spy kids prance around nude. Clive Owen's story I thought was the best, and the most intense but the least realistic. Most of the blood in this chapter is white due to the fact that if it was red this movie would've been a no brainer NC-17. You see a few decapitations and partial decapitations, many dismemberment's, a lot of shooting including head shots, many deaths by stabbing and a lot of arrows are shot bye the deadliest character in the movie named Miho. Bruce Willis' story is the darkest of them all. To explain how I described this story earlier in a more formal fashion I will tell you it once more in a clearer way. Bruce Willis plays a clean cop who saves a little girl named Nancy and shoots the man who kidnapped her (the senators son) arm off, penis off, and ear off. But in the process he is shot 10 or more times by the son and by his own partner. He is sent to jail and the little girl writes him once a week for 8 years. But one day he doesn't get a letter. He doesn't get any letters for 2 months until he gets a letter with a finger in it. He confesses to get out of jail to know for sure what happened to Nancy. He finds her as a stripper at a bar but he is tracked by the senators son who is now yellow which is explained in the film. The son kidnaps Nancy again and attempts to hang Willis. Willis breaks free and goes to save Nancy. The story unfolds violently and at the end grossly. In this story you see a few stabbings many shootings, a man gets his you know what shot and ripped off (real nasty), and a man is almost hung and there are a few scenes of people getting beat up badly. Sin City overall is awesome and very very violent in many ways. Its fun to see with friends but don't see it on a date. Peace Out Antichessclub5423"

","I was not incredibly enthusiastic about seeing ""Sin City"". Lately there have been so many horrible films based solely around art direction (""Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow"" is the first one that comes to mind). Plot, characters, drama, tension, excitement, humor; all of these become lost when a film is based around a ""look"". Even some of those vaunted ""film noir"" films of the past ... well, frankly they suck. Bad acting, lame plots. I never saw what the interest was in them. They may have been fine for their time, but now they are just patently uninteresting.<br/><br/>I was very pleasantly surprised to see that ""Sin City"" is not one of those films.<br/><br/>This film has excitement; it has tension; it has very interesting characters; it has funny dialogue at times. In short, this is a fun (but violent) trip through a graphic novel.<br/><br/>Benicio Del Torro is an absolute hoot. Elijah Wood is an amazingly believable (and creepy) assassin. Bruce Willis is great ballsy cop on the edge of retirement. And the women! Wow, are they hot! I've always been big on Rosario Dawson, but ... wow! So many cast members are excellent in their roles, and they play it over-the-top like the characters they portray.<br/><br/>This is not a film for the kiddies, it is very violent, even gory at times. So it's clearly not for everyone. But if you like watching movies with a very dark edge, this is for you.<br/><br/>This is also a film based on 3-4 different story lines (like Pulp Fiction). Not everyone likes that, either, so if you like linear storytelling this isn't for you.<br/><br/>I do have to take off a few points here and there. Clive Owen's performance was pretty lackluster. And the edits between the various stories were too short, it ended up not flowing too well together at times.<br/><br/>But overall a good flick. 9 out of 10.<br/><br/>Barky"

","By far, this is probably one of the best movies I have seen since ""Gladiator"" because even the smallest aspect of this movie is incredible. The characters really pull you in and make you truly involved with the movie. When I watched this movie a week and a day after it came out, I regret not seeing it on opening night! This movie is absolutely incredible. I am a huge fan of the film-noir style films and the darker sides of life and all of the characters electrified the movie, even the smallest roles (ie: Elijah Wood's ""Kevin"" character. I still have nightmares about that guy!). I find myself talking to my friends who have seen this movie and say, ""Which story was your favorite?!"" and most say that it is either Marv or Hartigan's story. Personally, I find Hartigan's story more personal and in-depth. It was sad how after saving Nancy, he had to spend 8 years in jail and ruin his reputation in order to protect her. I was happy to see that they reunited and defeated Yellow Bastard (who was absolutely DISTURBING! Bravo Nick Stahl!). I love Bruce's soliloquy's (spelling?) and how he would always encourage himself to fight on despite his age and heart condition. Definite courage to be admired. If such a thing were possible, every character should deserve an Oscar for that movie! I suggest that everyone sees this movie as soon as possible! After reading this, get some buddies together and hit this movie up! I guarantee you will not be disappointed! :)"
"cart1776","10","0","1","11 April 2005"," Sin City is utterly amazing
","""Walk down the right back alley in Sin City and you can find anything."" These are the brick-breaking words that kick off The Hard Goodbye, the first of three dark tales that make up Sin City, the latest outing from legendary director Robert Rodriguez, based upon the graphic novels by Frank Miller, who also serves as co-director. What is truly remarkable about this quote, though, is what the audience finds. Amidst the shadowy underworld of crooked cops, vigilante hookers and twisted murderers where Sin City takes place, a great film can be found, one that is visually astonishing, brazenly acted, gloriously directed and totally original.<br/><br/>The film, which combines three of Miller's books (The Hard Goodbye, The Big Fat Kill and That Yellow Bastard), is actually an elaborate conglomeration of multiple stories, all about one story. Through the eyes of several extraordinary characters, ranging from the innocent and tormented to the deranged and sadistic, the audience is plunged into a seamy world where the bad go badder and the good go bad-ass.<br/><br/>The three stories follow three disparate men, each on a quest for retribution, redemption, or a little bit of both. Marv (Mickey Rourke), a hulking lug of a guy with a short temper and an even shorter attention span, is on the run from the law after being framed for the murder of Goldie (Jaime King), a beautiful prostitute he falls in love with after one night. Dwight (Clive Owen), a reformed killer with everything to prove and even more to lose, is on a mission to save the sultry and sexy girls of Old Town, Sin City's hooker point, particularly his ex-flame, Gail (Rosario Dawson), from Manute (Michael Clarke Duncan), a ruthless and evil dictator, after an incident with a sex-craved maniac named Jackie Boy (Benicio Del Toro) sparks an all-out war. John Hartigan (Bruce Willis), a seasoned cop, beaten down by a bum ticker and thoughts of retirement, is hot on the trail of Junior (Nick Stahl), a fluorescent-colored freak-show of a pedophile, who is out to get revenge on Hartigan by murdering Nancy Callahan (Jessica Alba), a girl Hartigan saved from Junior eight years earlier. The film also features a short segment entitled The Customer is Always Right, featuring Josh Hartnett and Marley Shelton.<br/><br/>What is utterly outstanding about the film itself is its absolute devotion to its source material. Rodriguez has not so much created an adaptation of Frank Miller's bookssuch as Sam Raimi has done with Spider Man and Guillermo Del Toro has done with Hellboybut has fashioned a literal translation: What you see in the comics is what you see on the screen. Each and every panel in the book serves as a storyboard for each and every frame in the film. Even the coloring of the booksa desolate landscape of black and white that is enhanced with light patches of color here and thereis accurately displayed, from the emerald blue eyes of Alexis Bledel's stunning Becky, to the grimy yellow skin of Nick Stahl's ""Yellow Bastard"", as well as the gallons of red blood that pump out of the characters at, seemingly, every moment of the film. It is a huge undertaking that, at first, seems gimmicky, but quickly surpasses the ""Ooh-ah"" factor and lures the audience into a story that is equally fascinating and compelling. In order to achieve this feat, Rodriguez shot the entire movie against green-screen with only the actors in the foreground, which allowed him to add the props, backgrounds and color effects in post-production. This all-the-more enhances the dramatic and emotional aspects of the books, because it allows the performances and Miller's gripping narrative to come first. All-in-all, this is film noir at its gritty and gory best.<br/><br/>Of the three main performances, Clive Owen's is the most resounding. His portrayal of an honest man with a shady past, desperately struggling to reclaim his existence by doing the right thing, rings true for anyone who has ever tried to fight back. Mickey Rourke gives a bravura performanceand makes a well-deserved comebackas Marv, and is able to bring an inner turmoil that inspires sympathy and remorse to an otherwise big and bad lout of a character. Bruce Willis turns in another knockout performance as Hartigan, a man who battles whatever evil lurks about and wrestles to make the neighborhood a better place, despite the fact that his body is telling him to turn in and clock out. The lovely ladies of Sin City also give impressive performances. Jessica Alba becomes the graceful and child-like epitome of every man's dream as Nancy. Rosario Dawson makes Gail a tough-as-nails force to be reckoned with, finally shaking the role of ""the girlfriend"". Though her role as Goldie is short-lived, Jaime King gives the audience a lasting impression as a woman trying desperately to find love and re-birth in the face of her occupation (Watch for the moment where she is reunited with Marv in the form of her twin sisterit's enough to bring tears to your eyes).<br/><br/>It is easy for the audience to wonder what the point of Sin City is. Is it purely for them to watch in wide-eyed amazement at the look of something that has never been seen before? Is it merely for them to be drawn into a seedy world that could possibly serve as a model for modern society? Or perhaps it is simply to exist as the greatest comic-book-turned-movie ever made. The point is this: There is no justice without sin. Through Sin City and its inhabitants, the audience is forced to confront their own demons and face their worst fears of vice, lust and loneliness. It is a point that scars with brutal poignancy and resonates with raw veracity. Despite the roughness and the violence, Sin City is a righteous film, and it wouldn't have it any other way."
"Chris Knipp","Null","0","2","8 April 2005"," Nasty violence, with a 'cool' look
","Robert Rodriguez's 'Sin City' (for which he gives graphic novelist Mark Miller co-director credit) is a beautiful, stylish, and ingenious adaptation, but even for a filmed comic book it's violent to the point of being brain-dead. One thinks longingly of the pleasing teenage romantic darkness of that brooding revenge fantasy, 'The Crow,' both Alex Proyas' version and Tim Pope's sequel. There's revenge in both, but 'Sin City's' revenge is so heavily laced with confused morality that it gives no satisfaction. If you want ingenious ultra-violence, try Kubrick's 'Clockwork Orange', where the violence is saved up and released so that it has a shocking elegance and a punch. If you want teenage adventure with the same look (at a time when such techniques seemed fresh and new) -- stylized black and white with touches of color -- try Coppola's 'Rumble Fish.' Despite its nice look and its heavy overproduction using all the latest technical tricks, Sin City pales in comparison with all these.<br/><br/>In fact the only movies 'Sin City' stands up well against, ultimately, are Rodriguez's other ones. This is his most complex and probably his best effort: here, he has bolstered his usually thin content by slavishly following Miller's cartoon books and linking up three of them so we've got a little cluster of characters and stories, although whether the stories are really interwoven or just stuck together is sometimes hard to say. Little is discernably added to the stories by Rodriguez; at times he follows dialogue and image as if the books were his storyboards. The effect is of a waxworks rather than a new permutation.<br/><br/>A comic book/graphic novel is one thing and a movie is another. This distinction seems to be more and more lost. But on the one hand, you can have an effect like the Superman, Batman, or Spiderman movies, where the cartoon images are fleshed out with (at best) good, live actors and special effects. On the other hand, you have a movie that becomes a comic strip, like Richard Linklater's marvelous, twittering, 'Waking Life.' Any imaginative animation may have this quality, though digital animation, with its glossy roundness, loses the pleasing flatness of real cartoons, which are hollow and two dimensional, and either made out of black lines or filled in with flat Ben Day dot color. ('Waking Life' has the quality of hand drawing in every frame, because Bob Sabiston designed all the images that way.) 'Sin City' exists in neither world but rather in some Neverland where the actors are made to seem unreal with prosthetics and costumes and CGI but the drawn quality also has been lost. <br/><br/>Part of the ""fun"" of the rather joyless horror fest that Sin City becomes when fleshed out as a movie, as opposed to the stylized and stylish black and white images of Miller's books, with their dry, artificial quality (in the books, there's plenty of white; in the movie, the prevailing color is a gloppy gray, characteristic of a very different kind of comic book drawing), is spotting the various well known actors. Typically, Bruce Willis (Hartigan) looks just like Bruce Willis (has he ever donned any disguise other than a small hairpiece?). Clive Owen as Dwight looks like Clive Owen too, only more handsome, and also sadly more ordinary without his English accent. It may take you a while to recognize Benicio del Toro in the very evil Jackie Boy, and he hardly has the lazy, teasing speech mannerisms of del Toro: but is that an improvement? Are these actors making comic book characters larger than life, or are they just disappearing into them? Unlike these is the Yellow Bastard, the final evil manifestation of the evil politician's depraved son (played by Nick Stahl, who always looks sallow and nasty), because he looks like the Golem--an animatron with a yellow head. Perhaps the only actor who really rises to the occasion is Mickey Rourke, who's no stranger to deep cover as an actor and whose pugilistically battered face has been completely made over.<br/><br/>But what are all these people doing? I'd really rather not say, if you don't mind. Probably when I was twelve I would have loved this movie. One of my favorite things to watch in movies back then was torture, smashed thumbs, eyes gouged out, bodies broken on the rack: I loved all that, because it meant nothing to me; it wasn't real. Now I know that this kind of stuff really happens all the time, and I don't want to see it. But this is a movie for boys, because here, again, as for me at twelve, none of it means anything; none of it is real. There's some pain over a little girl who is threatened with nastiness, but for the rest whether a guy has a hammer in his back or a knife sticking out of his brow matters not at all.<br/><br/>The girls are the best part, for sure. They're as tough and macho as the guys, and a lot better looking. But whether a whore in skimpy leather packing heat is an example of woman's liberation is not something worth debating. Cool? Yes, very cool, if you're fifteen, or forty-five going on twelve.<br/><br/>As has been pointed out, Rodriguez's literal reconstitution of these graphic novels is hardly as original as the graphic novels themselves, despite the technical innovations, and those novels themselves had less originality than the film noir they grew out of. The images of 'Sin City' remain striking and often beautiful, but I think there are in fact certain key elements in Miller's drawings that Rodriguez has failed to capture. He has used too many closeups and not enough of those wonderful distant, sharply angular images so typical of comic book vision. Did those themselves grow out of the work of people like Greg Toland, Orson Welles' cameraman for 'Citizen Kane'? Probably."

"Teknofobe70","9","0","1","10 April 2005"," A living comic book ... spectacular.
","It's certainly true that lately we've been bombarded with many big-budget Hollywood adaptations of comic book movies, and that many of them have been bad. The problem wasn't necessarily with the movies themselves, but with their lack of originality. They all go for the same dark, Gothic Batman-esquire style, which, appealing as it may be, frankly just gets a little boring. We've been waiting a long time for someone to bring us something truly original in this genre ... and here it is.<br/><br/>""Sin City"" tells three different stories, all of which take place on the same night, and all of which are connected by at least one character and common themes. It's dark and it's bloody and, to be honest, a bit silly, but all in all it's a great work of fantasy. The actors relish both in their character's originality and in Frank Miller's gritty, ingenious dialogue. Plain and simple, this movie is a mini-masterpiece.<br/><br/>Very good performances all around from stars Clive Owen, Bruce Willis and Elijah Wood (an unusual role for Elijah, but he pulls it off extremely well). The standout performance, however, comes from Mickey Rourke as ""Marv"". He's probably the least well-known of all the main cast members, but this may well change after this. All of the supporting roles are filled out extremely well also ... Benicio Del Toro, Nick Stahl and Rutger Hauer in particular give memorable, if short, turns as their various characters.<br/><br/>After seeing Sin City you're left with the impression that you've just watched a computer generated animation rather than a movie, such is the visual feel of it. It is truly a direct translation of the comic book, and something which has never been done before. The only comparison I can come up with is a computer game -- ""Max Payne"", which itself is done in the style of a comic book, and like Sin City it mixes film noir with a Gothic horror style. This is, without a doubt, the finest comic book movie I have ever seen.<br/><br/>This movie deserves to be a hit. It deserves to have sequels. Anything else, would be a travesty. An injustice. A sin."

Yes, it's called ""Sin City"" and there is a reason why it's called ""Sin City"", with all the violence and brutality and sleaziness helping the film live up to its name--its title, but the fact of the matter is, they exhausted all those entities, along with others, to the core. <br/><br/>In the first hour, I was amazed by Sin City.

But at the same time, so are Kill Bill and Kill Bill 2, two movies that I disliked with passion. So I didn't really know what to expect from Sin City. Unfortunately I walked out of Sin City with mixed reviews.<br/><br/>First the good The attention to detail that went to transferring the comic book into movie is amazing. Backgrounds look exactly the same as they do in the comics, and to give the movie another dimension, many features, such as rain and scenes that show characters all white against black background, have comic book look to it. This movie take the technology introduced in Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow to a whole new level. Mickey Rourke is amazing as tough-as-nail Marv. Perfectly cast, perfectly played out part. Elijah Wood creates perfect Kevin. I get the chills while reading the comic every time Kevin shows up. Movie is no different. Devon Aoki and Rosario Dawson do excellent job as well.<br/><br/>The bad So many actors are not suited for their roles. Bruce Willis does not suit almost 70 year old Hartigan. Clive Owen, Benicio Del Toro, Jessica Alba, Brittany Murphy, Joshua Hartnett all are playing parts not suited for them. The inner monologue that each character work brilliantly in the comic, but for some reason looks ridiculous in the movie. Each character thinks as if they are all read Wall Street Journal and watch private eye flicks from 40's. Sometimes the end result is simply laughable. The scene when Clive Owen is being pulled out from the lake by Devon Aoki is a perfect example of that. Finally, when characters do talk, it is always as if the words are being forced out of them, always ending with a big sigh. <br/><br/>Overall, I don't think the movie deserves to be in the top 250 of all time, let alone top 100. It is solid, but not great, and definitely not deserving all the hype it got so far."

","I thought that Sin City was a decent noir film, but nowhere near as good as the hype would indicate. Seems like the same audience that loved Kill Bill is falling over Sin City. Violence for the sake of violence. Is there any kind of commentary either Rodriguez or Tarantino are making about violence through the evisceration-a-second action? In the case of both, I don't think they let their work become too intellectual. It's like they put the violence in a pill for you to swallow and you absorb it and dump it a few hours later, end of story. Films like these don't really stick with me because they are a more concerned with reaching the pinnacle of style and being cool.<br/><br/>Mickey Rourke had the most sincere performance stand out from the muddle. Perhaps it is because Rourke starred in one of the greatest noir films of all time, Angel Heart. He didn't have to reach very far, which is not to say he is dialing in his performance, but he excels in the genre. Clive Owen, Rutger Hauer, Rosario Dawson and Benicio Del Toro were the second tier. Everyone else falls somewhere below for the following qualities: posing like a filmed storyboard, acting like an over-directed stand-in with lines, or simply failing to rise above the material, which is not that great to begin with. Classic film noir with a lot of shock value and a slick new film look. <br/><br/>The look is most certainly unique. No doubt that many people will imitate its style in the coming years in a variety of media; print ads, commercial spots, other noir-type films, TV shows, etc. <br/><br/>I suppose if there is any positive to come out of Sin City, it's that murdering a religious figure or corrupt Father through a confessional is the proper radical response to some of the unethical religious intervention in the current political landscape."

If you can stand the tacky and satirical old-school film noir movie narrative (akin to the writing of Frank Miller's novels), it really turns out to be a must-see.<br/><br/>The cinematography is really what stood out the most for me, it was amazing and as close as you could possibly get to the actual art in the original novels.

Great number of star cameos, very much in the true Terrantino style (although he is only a guest director). Overall, this movie leaves you feeling satisfied.<br/><br/>I don't think this is for every one though. Lots of violence and brutality.

","I must say, I am very impressed by this film. I do not read comic books, and I've never read the graphic novels for Sin City. This film has certainly made me curious.<br/><br/>The visual style is stunning, the romantic themes are endearing, the action is edge of your seat, and the characters are jaw-dropping awesome. I can't figure out why there is so much trashing by critics. What do you guys like??? Why do you even watch movies??? It's obvious that they miss the point on many great films, because SC grips you all the way and every five minutes it gives a moment where you just want to shout ""DAMN, That was cool!!!!"" The cast is top notch, the stories are excellent. Are there any flaws? None that got to me. It was a very satisfying experience.<br/><br/>To watch Marv, Hartigan, and Dwight in action is like watching Greek heroes from Mythology take on insurmountable tasks. It's Perseus vs the Medusa, Theseus vs the Minotaur, Jason traveling the world to get the Golden Fleece. These are ordinary men thrown into impossible situations, fighting the good fight for the sake of a woman they love. Each of them reaches a low point that spells their doom, but just as they are about to give up and die, they find within themselves the ability to go on, and not just cheat death in that moment, but to overcome defeat in ways they never dreamed possible.<br/><br/>This is all sounding dramatic, perhaps too dramatic, but these are the kind of moments that turn ordinary characters like Dwight, Marv and Hartigan into legends of epic mythological proportions, like Frodo or Luke Skywalker, Van Helsing or Hamlet, Odeysseus or Moses, etc.<br/><br/>Oddly enough, it's a very pro-Feminist movie. The women are very much empowered, and the good guys are very courteous to them, almost chivalric. It's refreshing to see a film that combines noir themes with outdated notions like chivalry. The film, despite its level of violence, is not crude. The dialogues and behaviors are from a bygone era in an age where TV And films try to shock us. There's a difference between ""Shock value"" and being ""Jaw-Dropping"". This movie balances all those details.<br/><br/>I highly recommend Sin City. It just kicks ass on many levels. Ignore critics. They don't get it, and they never will."

This movie is called SIN CITY not the happy elf movie not Disney jerks you off, this is Gory sick stuff thats in your face the whole time. most women will not like this movie; however, if you want to get rid of the wife for a night and see something really great this would be the thing to see. The style of the movie really pulls you in from the start then they push you from story to story the whole time keeping you on the edge of your seat, so get a soda kick back and enjoy Frank Millers Sin City.<br/><br/>P.S.

","First thing's first: Good movie. Very, very good movie. But not great. Let me be clear, I saw this movie on opening weekend with four friends, two of them HUGE and well-versed fans of the graphic novels, and a third who had just read them the week before. Among them, they had zero complaints. So maybe I'm splitting hairs. You tell me--<br/><br/>First, and most obvious to me, was the fact that no actor ever stood more than 10 feet away from the camera. In close-ups, this isn't a problem, but in every group shot or wide shot, the actors were ALWAYS in the foreground, and never spaced very far apart, depth-wise. After 20 minutes, I could start to see where the green screen hung on the back wall. Not literally, of course, but I had a pretty good idea. In the ""Big Fat Kill"" sequence, when the cops chase Jackie-Boy's gang into Old Town, there are four or five hookers who show up to watch... they're ALL in the foreground, on the same corner, just extras who walk in and flash their g-strings at the camera. To me, that's the most obvious example, but again, I could be nitpicking.<br/><br/>Second, there was no dramatic arc. Zero. The graphic novels felt real, because with a hundred still-shots making up a book, your brain fills in the rest. With a motion picture, in this case, filling in the rest FOR me, I didn't find it as affecting. A character dies, a character is injured, beaten, kissed, I felt nothing. In the books it was real, because Frank Miller's incredible artwork evoked the emotion he was going for in any individual frame: fear, terror, revulsion, lust. In the movie, with a familiar face filling in, the actors LOOK like their characters, but they don't INHABIT them. The best way around that, of course, is to cast no-names, but I understand it's tough to market a movie like that. So there we are.<br/><br/>Beyond that, I still have to say I enjoyed the movie. The visuals were stunning, both Miller's original work, and Rodriguez's interpretation of it to turn it into a real place. I just missed the character, which isn't usually present in an action movie anyway, but, y'know, it was in the books, so... maybe it's just me. 8/10."

","The movie is well produced and edited. While directed by several directors, the feel is still fluid without giving up the flavor of each. Holds true to the comic and doesn't really compromise. Some of the violence is a bit graphic so better to keep the under 14 crowd away. Definitely worth the trip to the theater.<br/><br/>Outstanding performance from Mickey R. Acting through all the makeup, he was still able to emote well. Perfect vehicle for Bruce and if you can get past the ick factor of the ""relationship"" you'll see one of his better efforts.<br/><br/>The old town sub plot is a bit strained and is the weakest part of the movie which contributes to the less than perfect 10 rating I dished. The usage of silhouettes and the comic-like use of shadow and light (especially during the graphically violent scenes) is used to superb effect."

","I've never read any of the comic books, but I thought this movie was a pretty damn good movie. Robert Rodriguez did a fantastic job of transforming this comic book into a movie. Of course, having the creator (Frank Miller) co-direct helps a lot too. To me, it was a fine visual display of work. The black and white w/colors at time made the movie to me. This was better than anything like Pleasantville (Good Movie) or Sky Captain (Yuck!). The way the colors were used were perfectly done and blended well on screen.<br/><br/>The dialogue, while cheesy, was pretty entertaining. There were some memorable quotes, especially from Mickey Rourke's character Marv. However, I think a few of the characters were almost too excruciating to watch. Primarily Michael Madsen (Bob) and Brittany Murphy (Shellie). Michael Madsen plays Bruce Willis's (Hartigan) partner in the movie and the delivery and tone was too bad, almost porno-bad. This wasn't a very good way to pretty much start the movie/storyline. But I've liked Michael Madsen in the majority of the things he has done so I'll give him a break. Brittany Murphy on the other hand just didn't get the job done. I've never really liked Brittany Murphy in anything and her acting in this is horrendous.<br/><br/>However, the good outshine the bad. Mickey Rourke stole the show in my opinion. Marv was an awesome character and I don't think anyone could have done the job better than Rourke. This guy was big, mean, and ugly with superhuman strength. Do not screw with this guy. Rourke is out for revenge throughout the film and he is fighting a good cause for the most part. Clive Owen also performed very well as Dwight. I was impressed. Bruce Willis did his thing. Jessica Alba wasn't in the film as much as I thought she would be, but still played her role well. Elijah Wood is another character I'd like to comment on. He plays a Cannibal-like character named Kevin. I know most people are used to him as Frodo but I thought he did an excellent job playing a freaky mute-like character. Finally, Devon Aoki was fantastic at playing Miho, she kicked major ass in this.<br/><br/>The three story lines are pretty well told but they aren't that impressive to me. Hartigan fights for an eleven year old named Nancy from getting raped by a psychopath known as Rourk Jr./Yellow Bastard played by Nick Stahl. Marv seeks revenge for a hooker's death and will go to hell and back to find out who did it. Dwight seems to be a mellow guy who is a pretty damn good killer if provoked. But I don't think he likes to kill people unless they deserve it. He is in this to help the hookers stay to their normal lifestyle and prevent a war from happening. My question is why are all of these three stories intertwined. I think there is a connection between the main characters that is very subtle, but it is hinted at in the Dwight/Shellie conversation.<br/><br/>A final thing I'd like to comment on is the violence and the nudity. There is a lot of violence, I won't lie. This isn't for the faint of heart or little kids. That's why it's Rated R. To me, there isn't that much nudity in it. Yes, there's hookers wearing slutty clothing, but they're not nude or anything. There's only about three nude scenes that I can recall. This movie is called Sin City and it lives by its name. From what I've heard from the comic book fans, It also stays true to where it came from and I respect that a lot, not that many comic book movies can say the same thing. I give this movie an 8/10 for its great visual display, good acting, average story lines, great action/violence, and overall balls this movie had and lost. Walk down the right back alley in Sin City, and you can find anything...especially a movie that will not disappoint."

","Anybody know which scene Tarantino directed? Have my theories. My friend thinks it's the old town battle. That could be. I'm thinking maybe the car crash scene in the snow. But does anybody know for certain? I thought the movie was incredible. I feel better as a filmmaker for having seen it. I was back and forth on Rodriquez. Loved Mariachi, so so on his other stuff. Thrilled he's back and with a vengeance. So there. Maybe that'll fill my ten lines they're demanding. Can't wait to see the next series. Nope. Guess not. Here we go again. As far as the ""gratuitous"" violence I've read about on the other pages, I think that thinking is hogwash. It's a comic book for god sake. Settle down. And violence towards women? Violence towards everyone. Chill. I think maybe the gals in Old Town would probably disagree with you that they're being underrepresented. I think they came off kick-ass and just fine."

","This is truly a movie for a fan of Frank Miller. It is simply and purely, the motion version of Sin City. This is also not to say that this movie is incomprehensible to a lay person. There is something for everyone, but this movie is specifically for the fan.<br/><br/>Sin City is a collection of comic mini-series (about 8, with some one-shots) published by Dark Horse Comics in the late 1980' and early 1990's. Sin City is comparable to Las Vegas, but Vegas of the fifties and sixties. It is less glitz and a lot more grit. The comics are almost completely drawn in chiaroscuro (black and white) and are very angular. There is very little detail to the characters. Blood is usually a white glob. There is some color, however. Some of the characters eyes, hair, or clothes sometimes get the Ted Turner treatment (but the rest usually is still black or white). The stories are also not treated linearly. They jump around and various characters throughout the stories intermingle (""everyone knows everyone kind of place"", by reputation or otherwise). Sin City has it all : hookers, crooks, snitches, crooked cops and priests, dirty politicians, lawyers, gamblers, strippers, drunks, drug addicts, assassins, and regular Joes.<br/><br/>Rodriguez and Miller (who both have the directing credits) did an amazing job of copying and pasting from comic book into flesh and blood. This movie captures all the elements of the comic. First of all, the movie looks like the comic (not quite black and white, but definitely filtered). The city is dark, dingy and grimy. You can almost taste the 4 day old, tobacco laced coffee. It tastes like toast with a nice layer of dirt on top.<br/><br/>The majority of the story takes place around 3 of the mini-series (Sin City, The Big Fat Kill and That Yellow Bastard; there is also a little bit from The Babe Wore Red). The cast is also a who's-who's of the Hollywood heavyweights. Just about everyone in Hollywood signed up to do this picture.<br/><br/>Sin City is the original mini-series, which tells the story of a brute named Marv, who wakes up with a dead girl next to him. He's got to find out what happened. The Big Fat Kill is about a guy named Dwight who gets into a situation at his girlfriend's house, when her drunk old boyfriend shows up. That Yellow Bastard is the story of a tough, untouchable, old cop named Hartigan. Hartigan's final case (before retirement) has him looking for a child rapist/murderer.<br/><br/>It would have been nice if they introduced us with A Dame to Kill For instead of The Big Fat Kill. That way we would have gotten more background on Dwight. Even though the characters have a past and history, that isn't important. The comic books follow a film noir plan. The assumption here is that we don't get all the information on the characters. We have to accept them for what they are showing and piece together their past from their interactions. Its a detective novel wrapped up in an action thriller. The dialog is typical of what one would find in a film noir classic (think Bogart, but not quite as good, with some swearing - also lots of internal monologuing in a trench coat). I can forgive most of the dialog because it is suppose to be a little hokey. That is, what I thought was the weakest part of the entire movie. The rest is just marvelous. Some of the stories started up a little slow, but as soon as we got mid way into it, the action would kick in. This is a visually stunning looking movie. Thats the movie's (and the comic's) strength. It pulls you into the world. The action is fast and furious. At times it is staccato (jumps from kill to kill in a faced past motion - we don't linger on a kill) and at others its is quite over the top (i.e. - the end of The Big Fat Kill). I highly recommend this film for fans of film."

","Sin City isn't the kind of movie you'd bring home to meet your mother. Mine would get along just fine with it but that's beside the point. The comic book was brilliant and the treatment in the hands of Hollywood studio system eschewing Robert Rodriguez the film is nothing short of a shotgun blast to the frontal lobewhich is good. The film is a series of vignettes which follow three lead characters through a never-never-land of torture, brutal beatings, evisceration, gorgeous women and enough munitions being spread across the black and white CGI night to make your head spin. Sin City follows Marv (brilliantly portrayed by Mickey Rourke) across a landscape of hard drinking, pill popping, delusional revenge. Detective Hartigan (a wonderfully hard nosed Bruce Willis) the one good cop in Sin City, a fictional but oddly Los Angelesque nightmare town, takes a dive to save a little girl (who grows up to be Nancy Callahan (Jessica Alba)), and Dwight (Clive Owen, well played but a little trouble with the accent) puts his head (or a head anyway) on the line to help out a group of ladies of negotiable affection. What Miller (who's listed as a co-director) does with his work is go beyond paying homage to the greats of noir fiction. He takes the seediness and grit of Hammett, Chandler, and Leonard and puts them under a microscope. His artistry was brought to life by director Robert Rodriguez and his Renegade Studios in an astounding assault of computer effects and smears them across the silver screen in a way that frankly the usual action film schlock fails miserably to do. Rodriguez (and in one key scene Quentin Tarrantino) create a hellish vision on screen, they take their medium and push it for all it's worth. We have enough films with Drew Barrymore thank-you, let's burn something into the celluloid that burns back. But Sin City isn't for the faint of heart. Is the film violent? The film glorifies violence to an astonishing degree, artistically and stylishly enough that it brings a tear to the eye, but still. If you are the type of person who has a good deal of trouble separating what you are seeing on the magic screen from reality or are unstable (I suppose the first bit is the unstable but I want the warning to include all of those who are ""differently"" sane), not a good film for you. Is there sex? Er, well some, there's a lot of nudity anyway. It is however a film based on a comic book whose primary characters were all killers, cops and prostitutes so you have to expect corruption and brutality. The killers and prostitutes are fairly rough trade as well. What Sin City becomes in the hands of Rodriguez that has escaped the grasp of every preceding Hollywood director who has gotten their greasy media pandering mitts on a comic book is a faithful retelling. What your seeing on the screen is an almost scene-for-scene, frame by frame rendering of Millers ode to noir, and that's the best bit of all."
"kgprophet","7","0","1","6 April 2005"," Best Comic Book film ever made
","There have been many attempts to make a movie look like a comic book. ""Dick Tracy"" effectively used prosthetics and comic book colours and costumes to give it that look. However, the story suffered. ""The Shadow"" also made good use of creating a comic book reality, where people talked and acted like they were from a comic book. Even ""The Hulk"" had the innovative use of transitions by scanning across boxes on a comic book. And so on. The primary flaws of these films were both a gripping story and lack of complete immersion into the comic book world. (For some reason I am reminded of ""Cool World"", another disaster).<br/><br/>""Sin City"" finally takes the comic book film genre into it's rightful place. That is, completely separated from reality. Here, Marv, a lowbrow dude, can't be killed by a hail of bullets or otherwise. Backgrounds are completely comic book in their illustrations, using CGI selectively to animate them. The broad use of monochrome design with splashes of colour works perfectly. The overall tone of the film feels like ""Pulp Fiction"", both comic in their ultra-violence. Indeed, this is the first film I have seen that is a worthy successor to the ""Pulp Fiction"" style, with ""Kill Bill"" a close second.<br/><br/>But back to the true strength of this film - story. The three primary plots are original and fast paced. Simplified but not stupid, strong performances (although Bruce Willis didn't break any new ground) of characters who have strong personalities and strong motivations. Mickey Rourke, almost unrecognisable as Marv, gives one of the best performances of his career and carries the film more than anyone else. Rodriguez was perfect for directing, using his experience from his early films to create high energy scenes. The film is fast-paced, with little extraneous dialogue to bog it down.<br/><br/>This film should be considered a classic, it certainly will be a cult hit for years to come. You maybe have seen close attempts of a film like this, but none in the past have achieved the absolute comic reality portrayed in this film.<br/><br/>I give it an 8 out of 10."
"JimD73","9","0","2","6 April 2005"," Ten Years Later, We Have Found The Next ""Pulp Fiction""
","Plot: Since Sin City, much like Pulp Fiction, is a combination of three different stories that interconnect in some ways, it seems more fitting to give a score for each story rather than combine them.<br/><br/>""Sin City/The Hard Goodbye"": 9/10: The first story opens up with street thug Marv (Rourke) making love with Goldie (King), a prostitute whom Marv has become smitten with. When he wakes up in the morning to find Goldie dead and the cops on his tail, Marv is outraged. He escapes the cops and, with the help of his parole officer Lucille (Gugino), he sets out to find Goldie's killer, including a meeting cannibalistic killer Kevin (Wood). Along the way, Goldie's twin sister Wendy (also King), whom is under the impression that Marv killed Goldie, sets out to kill Marv.<br/><br/>It's a great set up here, but Marv's strength becomes almost silly. This is basically the only one of the three stories that ever feels like a traditional super-hero type comic book.<br/><br/>""The Big Fat Kill"": 10/10: My personal favourite of the trio, it focuses on the character of Dwight (Clive Owen), who was briefly seen in Marv's story. While he is with barmaid Shellie (Brittany Murphy), her former lover Jackie Boy (Del Toro) arrives and forces his way in with his friends. When Dwight threatens Jackie Boy, they leave, but Dwight follows Jackie Boy into Old City, the major prostitute hangout, and warns the prostitutes about him. He finds out that the prostitutes, led by Gail (Dawson), have already taken that initiative and, using the young Becky (Bledel) as bait, their assassin Miho (Aoki) effectively turns Jackie Boy and his friends into Pez dispensers. However, things take a turn for the worse when they find out Jackie Boy is Jack Rafferty, a highly respected cop.<br/><br/>This is the best and bloodiest of the three.<br/><br/>""That Yellow Bastard"": 8/10: This one is the worst of the three, but that does not mean it is by any means bad. In fact, it's opening scene, which is shown right after the opening credits, is better than the opening of any other story. It starts with Hartigan (Willis), apparently the last honest cop in Sin City, going after serial child molester ""Junior"" Rourk (Stahl) who has kidnapped 11-year-old Nancy Callahan (played later by Alba). The problem is that Junior's father is Senator Rourk (Booth), who has covered for his son of numerous occasions. Hartigan is determined to bring him down, punching out his partner Bob (Madsen) when he tries to stop him, and eventually saves Nancy and shoots Junior three times, one of the shots castrating him. Then Bob comes along and shoots down Hartigan.<br/><br/>After we hear the other two stories, this one is picked up again. It is 8 years later, and Hartigan has been locked up in solitary for the whole period, while Senator Rourk badgers him to sign a confession to Junior's child molestation charges. Hartigan has been receiving letters from Nancy Callahan weekly, and when they stop and a human finger is sent to him, he leaves to make sure she is safe. However, he is followed by Junior, transformed by multiple surgeries into a yellow creature. When he finds Nancy in a strip bar, the two of them leave together to escape from Junior and attempt to clear Hartigan's name.<br/><br/>This one had great potential. Seriously. The opening scene shows that. For the most part, it lives up to it. The only real problem is Yellow Bastard. Sure, it makes for a nice visual effect and causes the villain to stand out, but the whole explanation being a side-effect of basically de-castrating him is a little vague.<br/><br/>Action: 13/15: Of course, with all this violence, there must be some cool action scenes. And there are some. However, this movie is more about maintaining the feel than giving some good action. Once you look back at it, there aren't many action scenes, but then again, that isn't the main attraction of the movie.<br/><br/>Visual Effects: 15/15: Even if you hate the rest of the movie, not a single person can say the visual effects are bad. The movie feels exactly like a comic book, and to go even beyond that, this movie can almost be called art. The black-and-white effect conveys the comic book roots as well as the dark seediness of Sin City, with the splashes of colour calling attention to specific areas, whether it be Yellow Bastard or splashes of blood.<br/><br/>Acting: 19/20: The first thing that you notice about the movie, before you see it, is the humongous cast. Needless to say, most of the actors do great in their roles. Granted, Madsen (Reservoir Dogs) doesn't give the best performance of his life the first time we meet him, and Alba isn't necessarily the best choice, acting-wise, for Nancy. However, we are treated with many noteworthy performances.<br/><br/>However, two performances stand out above the others. The first and foremost of which is Rourke. Now, Rourke hasn't had a great performance in a long time, but the role of Marv was made for him. He looks tough as nails, and has a true flame of determination in him. The other standout performance is from Del Toro (Traffic), who plays just about the sleaziest cop in Sin City, and really makes you both hate him and want to see more of this character.<br/><br/>Entertainment: 16/20: This isn't a movie for everyone. It is very violent, and very dark. However, if you can stand the violence, and if this style appeals to you, than you should not walk out disappointed.<br/><br/>Total: 90%: Sin City is basically the most accurate representation of a comic book ever. Kudos to everyone involved for making this movie, and it is now on my checklist to read some Sin City comics and hope for Sin City 2."

Among many of the big names in this new box-office hit, some include BRUCE WILLIS(""Armaggedon"", ""Die Hard""), JESSICA ALBA (""Idle Hands"", ""Fantastic Four""), MICKEY ROURKE(""The Rainmaker"", ""Once Upon A Time In Mexico""), CLIVE OWEN(""Sharman"", ""Bent""), ROSARIO DAWSON(""Josie And The Pussycats"", ""Men in Black 2""), BRITTANY MURPHY(""8-Mile"", ""Just Married""), ELIJAH WOOD(""Lord of the rings"", ""The Faculty""), and JAIME KING(""White Chicks"", ""Pearl Harbor"")</li></ul><br/><br/>The film's plot surrounds three story lines, each one about a character whose morals rise above the lowest low's of Sin City. One such following the struggle for a young girls innocence by a tough-as-nails detective Harnigan(WILLIS). Harnigan must go against all that represents the city, including it's corrupt law-system, in order to do what is right...<br/><br/>The second story depicts a mongoloid warrior of our day and age named Marvin(ROURKE), who is framed for the murder of a partic-ularly special hooker named Goldie(KING) and must fight to regain his name, and gain vengeance on her true assailant. As many find him guilty for the crime he didn't commit, the determined Marv is indeed assured to set things somewhat right in a city of pure evil...<br/><br/>The last tale is of the cities street hookers whose limited power prepares to fall as the shaky truce of Sin City and the streets ""leading ladies"" begins to crumble. The only hope for a solu- tion is a local street-rough known as Dwight(OWEN), mistress hooker Gail(DAWSON) and her crew of sexy and dangerous ladies. Together, they fight to uphold a weak-peace between those who run the streets, and those that run everything... <br/><br/>A very stylish film which closely follows the original ideals of Rodriguez/Tarantino films, ""Sin City"" is a must-see action film, and a detailed adrenaline rush for those who closely follow other films by the director. Also including names such as JOSH HARNETT, DEVON AOKI, MICHAEL CLARKE-DUNCAN, BENECIO DEL TORO, ALEXIS BLEDEL, MARLEY SHELTON and MICHAEL MADSEN, ""Sin City"" will very well become an instant classic, and one of the most entertaining films today."

","I have read some of the comments made by other users regarding this film.All of the feminist,and the sexist need to realize that this film is just entertainment.That being said I have never read one comic book on Sin City.What attracted me most to this movie was the star power and the fact that it was filmed in black and white.Not only does this film focus on the most immoral qualities of mankind.It also shows man at his basest and most savage.I thought that the action was cool and enjoyed the comedic voice overs.I thought Mickey Roarkes character was hilarious and entertaining.Bruce did to a child molester what any parent would love to do.I also found it refreshing that the prostitutes were not a bunch of scared victims.These women were tough and they defended their turf and each other.The depiction of all of the powerful people in politics,and law enforcement is also a reality that we live with every day.In some aspects on a more extreme level it mirrors life but,its a movie so sit back relax and enjoy the ride."
"smartaleck87","7","0","3","5 April 2005"," Somewhat disappointing.
","Sin City, bottom line, was a good movie. It kept me entertained, and had a lot of things going for (not the least of which was gratuitous violence and a terrific cast). However, the plot dragged at times and jumped recklessly from place to place. It's non-sequential in the same vein as Pulp Fiction, but much less organized and streamlined than that film was.<br/><br/>On the whole, though, I liked it. Despite is frenetic and often erratic pacing and occasional sheer weirdness, it was well written, well shot, well directed (though I am convinced that had Tarantino directed the entire film we might be talking about one of the greatest movies ever made as opposed to a merely good one), and well acted. I just wish Madsen had had a bigger part.<br/><br/>I give it a seven."
"Boulizon","7","0","3","5 April 2005"," Sin City: A bloody movie but...Very good.
","It was a considerable film. Though the black and white colors were the highest big point from it. Sometimes we see colors but the colors we do see appear to be the red on the women lips and some others but not much.The Narration of Sin City seemed to be a Pulp Fiction but much more violent and based on a Comic Book. Somehow, we have alternate stories from John Hartigan a noble cop, Marv(protagonist)the guy who wants to avenge Goldie, we also have Dwight, it's a three different stories which are clear and soft. The Quentin Tarantino scenes were the best. Though there is a 1$ dollard scene with the razor in the bathroom, the beginning with Hartigan driving his car and going after the son of the senator and then been shot by his partner(Michael Madsen from Reservoir Dogs). The movie was interesting but intensely violent. At least, the comic book ""style"" is very formidable and contains a super top great film."
"moviefan31717","10","0","3","5 April 2005"," Best Action Movie Ever!
","Once I heard about this movie I decided to read the books, and I was amazed. Right after I read all the books I wanted to see the movie. Mickey Rourke (Marv) does play the big, action guy who everyone likes. But my two favorite characters were the villains Yellow Bastard (Nick Stahl) and Kevin(Elijah Wood). The whole cast did a superb job and was casted perfectly with their roles. I especially liked how they did the movie in B&W to make it more like the comic. I never took my eyes off the screen because I was afraid I was going to miss something good. If you're into movies with action in ever scene then SIN CITY is just for you! It's not for people who can't take violence because it is a very violent movie. Fans of the books will not be disappointed!"
"elevated_consciousness","9","0","2","4 April 2005"," A new genre
","Sin City takes something that was whole yet limited in descriptive dimensions (the graphic novel), and does it pure justice by bringing it to a new audience, adding the right music, the right motion, the right sound, cast, color, makeup, voices, and other tools of recreating reality.<br/><br/>Does this graphic novel-turned movie lack the creativity we expect from movies? Was Rodriguez wrong to adapt Frank Miller's graphic novel panel-by-panel into a movie? I feel like a common response would be, ""its nothing new, it doesn't do what a movie should do. It should have been the movie 'edition' of the graphic novel, not just a panel-to-panel match of the illustrated book. It should do what a movie does"" My mind says that the transcription was perfect, it brought to life something beautiful that could only be copied, not altered. To do so would be to scar the child that Frank Miller created.<br/><br/>Does the movie refresh the audience? Sure it does. Generally it is violent, yet sensibly violent; angry yet impartially angry. It outlines a criminal method of living that I see people get fascinated with. It seems we are horrified by the possibility of it this horror existing within our reality, but instead of writing the surreal situations as too fantastic to be possible, the tiny flecks of sympathy and humanity made me feel that such extremity isn't far-fetched. I was gripped with intensity. Things such as love (Harington and Nancy), obsessive behavior (Marv), and fear/greed Becky remind us of sympathy, adolescent infatuation, and a common desire for safety and security.<br/><br/>Overall, this movie is true to its graphic novel roots. It is not about promoting an actor's ability, but about adding motion and music to a story that already is great."
"shattenjager777","7","0","2","4 April 2005"," Incredibly violent but equally stylish; rather disconnected but unified enough.
","As a warning to anyone interested in it, I must immediately point out that ""Sin City"" is an incredibly violent film including two separate scenes of a characters genitalia being removed (once by gunshot, once by hand), a woman biting into the neck of another woman, pulling the veins back out in her teeth, a man stabbing another in the chest just as a warning, and more gunshot wounds than all the James Bond movies combined--and that's just the start. The violent carnage of the film is absolutely and brutally beyond compare. Now to comments about the film.<br/><br/>""Sin City"" is both the ultimate expression of and the ultimate satire of film noir--presenting the black and white backdrops, hard-boiled older detective-esqe tough guy heroes, the hysterical, mysterious, barely clothed women, the maniacally powerful villains and evil murderers, and the over-the-top dramatic narration that defines that genre, but doing so to such an extreme that it becomes a self-parody (I prefer to think on purpose). There are several different stories in the film only loosely tied together by the last one (and rather predictably and clumsily so), but they are all tied by the fact that they are truly all explorations of this city where violence is the center of life.<br/><br/>Robert Rodriguez's direction is definitely the film's true star. The black-and white look with the comic-book effect slanted rain drops (always, as in noir, present) and splashes of vibrant color is truly fascinating, and Rodriguez does explore the dramatic possibilities of black and white, perhaps reminding some viewers that color has disadvantages (though I'm betting it won't work on my father). The color, however, is seemingly random in when and where it appears, what gets colored, and what color it is. We see a red dress and red lipstick on the first woman we see, but shortly thereafter we see yellow blood, then blonde hair, then blue eyes, and there doesn't seem to be much of a common element to them. (The blue eyes are particularly unusual since they are used on one character who doesn't talk and one who talks too much.) Still, the look is so interesting that it does keep the viewer wanting to watch despite its weaknesses.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the film's cast is a star party. When Rutger Hauer (admittedly past his peak but still a star), Elijah Wood (who just starred in three of the biggest hit films of all time and then had a supporting role in the indy hit ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind,"" another success), and Benicio Del Toro (a deserved Oscar winner who has had success after success for the last decade) are your minor stars; you have a huge, huge cast. Surprisingly effective in the film is Bruce Willis. While it's not too far off of his typical slightly beaten, slightly on edge tough guy, this role allowed Willis to use his natural charisma to its best and to show more emotion than he usually does, and he was more than up to the challenge. Meanwhile, the film's only casting choices truly worth note are Elijah Wood's surprising turn as a silent villain and Rutger Hauer's somehow fascinating single-scene role as ""the most powerful man in the state."" Wood doesn't have to perform at all, but his appearance is rather startling just because it is so out of place for the empathic-eyed former hobbit. Hauer, however, creates the film's most interesting character in only one scene of work--we know that Cardinal better from that scene than we know Marv from his entire chapter, it seems, and he is absolutely fascinating.<br/><br/>The film also suffers some defects in its score, which is lackluster and recapitulate at best, and its oversexualized nature. Miller's world is sort of like the one in which Pete Dayton finds himself in David Lynch's brilliant ""Lost Highway,"" a hyper-masculine, unreal world of unabashed sex and violence. However, where Lynch's film explores this world as a part of a man's unconscious, Miller's world truly IS. And that makes the extreme violence and sexuality much more discomfiting than Lynch's. While I'm not one to ask for any kind of censorship or anything, I will say that it's an over-the-top sexually and violently explicit world to the point that it is unnerving.<br/><br/>Overall, ""Sin City"" is a very stylish and rather interesting film. It's yet another attempt to bring back noir, like the aforementioned ""Lost Highway's"" noir update or Brian DePalma's attempts at more direct modernizations of noir, but it may do so the most effectively since it is the closest to true noir of these films and yet also takes Lynch at his word in creating a new noir for the 21st century by extending the noir principles and style in new and similar directions. Still, let's not forget noir has faults--predictable story lines, one-dimensional characters, over-the-top dramatics, and extreme violence being the most noticeable--and ""Sin City"" commits those sins (pun fully intended) full-force, sometimes brazenly and triumphantly marching over them and sometimes getting a rake in the face in the process. The characters aren't deep, the story lines aren't terribly original, and the violence is perhaps too much; but it's entertaining and perhaps even asks some good questions in the subtext."
"MovieManiacX","10","0","2","4 April 2005"," Simply Amazing!!!
","This is one of the wildest movies I've seen within the last five years. It's dark, gritty, violent, funny (at times), bloody, sad, and over-the-top, all at the same time. This makes it a heck of a lot of fun. My eyes never left the screen.<br/><br/>The look of the film makes it interesting to watch with the splashes of color (mainly blood) thrown in here and there. It gives the film an uber-cool, highly stylized feel. It is so close to a comic book that you can practically imagine someone turning the pages as you watch. Since it's based on Frank Miller's graphic novels, the movie also doesn't shy away from it's graphic subject matter, which includes cannibalism, rape, and pedophilia. While some might find this disturbing, it only adds to the film's dark and sinful themes.<br/><br/>The characters are wildly entertaining. Usually in comic book movies, the characters are one-dimensional and boring. Not so here. The acting is great, especially by the three leading men, Marv (Mickey Rourke, in an outstanding performance), Dwight, and Hartigan. Marv is one of the coolest badass characters to come across the screen in the last ten years. He's a hulking behemoth of a man that is cool and could probably beat the crap out of anyone. Each of them commands the screen and you can't take your eyes off of them. The stand-out females are Gail, Goldie/Wendy, and Miho. You would not want to cross these women. Miho can kill you before you even know she's there. All of the characters are excellent and with an A-list cast like this, you can't lose.<br/><br/>The gore and special effects are absolutely fantastic. On the gore end, we have everything you can imagine! It's graphically violent with lots of blood and body parts flying around. This includes, but is not limited to decapitations, impaling, stabbings, nasty bullet hits, chunky flesh bites, a gooey head smashing, dismemberments, and some bone-shattering punches. And I enjoyed every minute of it! The effects are excellent, though a few definitely look computer generated. The coolest ones are the brutal car crashes and the ear-shattering explosions.<br/><br/>Hands down to Robert Rodriguez and Frank Miller for creating one of coolest and most enjoyable films in a long time! I haven't been this excited and enjoyed a film so much since Blade II came out in 2002!<br/><br/>The Bottom Line: <br/><br/>A highly-stylized, graphically violent comic book movie with an excellent cast that is extremely fun!"

","When you first start watching this you think that the voice-overs and dialogue are painfully obvious and a little corny but i think that that is the way that it is supposed to be presented. Since it is based on a graphic novel I was expecting it to be a little different but i was completely blown out of the water. I really started to get into the movie and I came out of the theatre so excited that I just had to use the bathroom. It was not only completely beautiful but all the characters were wonderfully played. My personal favourites were Mickey Rourke, Clive Owen, Bruce Willis and the cute but deadly Devon Aoki.<br/><br/>Mickey Rourke did a wonderful job as the beast seeking revenge for the only dame that had ever shown him any sort of kindness. <br/><br/>Clive Owen is always the master of playing the dark, brooding characters that make chills run down your spine. And it doesn't hurt that he's not all that bad to look at either. <br/><br/>Bruce Willis is just awesome and it amazes me how I can find someone almost 40 years older than me that attractive.<br/><br/>Devon Aoki was just my favourite character of all. She doesn't say a single word but she just kicks so much ass that you have got to love her. <br/><br/>Robert Rodriguez is also one of my very favourite directors. If you liked any of his work than I guarantee that you will love this one. I walked in excited and came out amazed. Go see it and you will know what I mean. It will completely blow your mind."

","Hyper stylized, cool personified performances and comic book genre have combined to produce THE best film that I have seen in 10 years. Proud papa Frank Miller has to be handing out cigars for this baby!<br/><br/>My senses were on overload and the film did not disappoint. Delivering in excess and exceeding any expectations, this in one film that I will get lost in again and again (if not just to indulge in all that I missed the first time!). <br/><br/>Gripping and gritty this action PACKED, violence packed, slick and sexy flick is loaded with cheesy tag lines and even more Velveeta performances by almost everyone who appears (Brittney Murphy, Clive Owen and Jaime King to name a few).<br/><br/>Bruce Willis was born for this part and Micky Rourke (who I have never been a fan of, but am now rethinking that...)is perfection as the sociopath on a violent rampage of revenge.

"dantewyrmfoe","Null","0","3","4 April 2005"," A virtually perfect adaptation of a fantastic property
","To say that ""Sin City"" is a great movie would be the great disservice to the words ""great"" and ""movie"". <br/><br/>I went into it hoping for a comic book adaptation at least as good as X-men but would have settled for something as good as Constantine. What I got what the most faithful comic book adaptation I've ever seen...period. The look, the pace, the stories, the characters...everything was so dead on perfect that it made me teary eyed just to watch it. <br/><br/>It's always been my opinion that sometimes it's nice to let the floodgates open and let every disturbing base impulse spill out in front of you and then spend a few hours wallowing in your own filth. When your done with your id fueled rampage, if you were to take a step back and look at the mess you've made you'd see something truly beautiful. That is exactly what this movie is, it's unapologetically over the top. The violence and voice overs, the guns and girls, the stereotypes and archetypes, the enemies and archenemies, the passion and the pain, the finality of going too far when you've done all the wrong things for all the right reasons...and the disturbingly thin line between the redeemed and the fallen. <br/><br/>At first glance the violence is all you see. You see Basin city for what it appears to be on the surface, a disgusting pit full of corrupt cops, politicians, hookers, deadbeats, druggies and psychos...not all of which are mutually exclusive. But once you've given yourself up to it, let yourself accept the way things are, and understand the rules a little better...that's when the fun starts. It is at that moment when the picture becomes clear, it's when you get your first full glimpse of the bigger picture that you see just how breathtakingly beautiful it is. <br/><br/>Suffice it to say that I had been a pretty big fan of Frank Miller's ""Sin City"" for quite some time now, the stories he wrote were some of my first exposure to the broader spectrum of what comic books could be. The Movie adaptation didn't try to retell the stories, it didn't try to re-imagine them. For a change the director realized that this wasn't his story to change, it wasn't his world to alter and the only way to get the final product to come out just right was to get the hand of the creator to mold the clay himself. <br/><br/>OK so final words. Will you enjoy Sin City as much as I did? Hard to say, It requires a love for the film noire genre to begin with...I saw a lot of people getting irate at the constant voice overs and the fact that the film was presented in black and white. I saw people who were disgusted by the themes presented. I don't think this movie is for everyone, it's a hard pill to swallow. But if you are already of a mind to enjoy this type of entertainment then I think you won't be disappointed. <br/><br/>On another note...I think everyone who's only exposure to Elijah Wood has been his portrayal of Frodo Baggins has to watch this movie and look out for Kevin...sweet, baby faced, delightfully disturbing Kevin."
"gregsrants","8","0","3","4 April 2005"," Good start to the silly season
","When I scanned the release schedule for 2005, there were a few 'event' films that caught my eye immediately. Obvious were King Kong, War of the Worlds and the next Star Wars chapter. Not only are these three films critic proof - and will provide a cloud of raining money which will pour down upon the producing studio - but they also had me salivating even with the realization that if just one out of the three is any good then we are above the mean.<br/><br/>Take last year for example. Trailers appearing around Superbowl time got me pumped for Troy, The Day After Tomorrow and The Village. The result was one half decent Saturday afternoon matinée film surrounded by two pieces of crap. Unfortunately, this is the norm.<br/><br/>But that didn't deter me from putting aside my dimes and quarters when the new trailers for summer 2005 came rolling out, and Sin City was the first of the five to jump out of the gate.<br/><br/>The making of Sin City was fascinating onto itself. Based on the graphic novels by Frank Miller, director Robert Rodriguez caused a Hollywood coup when he resigned from the Directors Guild of America after they refused to give Miller a director's credit on the film (due to Miller's style in the novels). Such rebellion against the collective hasn't been seen in Tinsletown since Elia Kazan named names.<br/><br/>And then there was the word of the cast collection involved with the film. Willis, Del Toro, Rourke, Murphy (Brittany not Eddie), Owen, Alba.the list went on to read like a who's who of hip. When anyone asked a month ago ""Who is in Sin City?"", I would invariably answer, ""Who isn't?"". It is a dream cast in a dream project and I X'd out the calendar dates until the April 1st release.<br/><br/>With all this expectation, Sin City would surely be a let down. How could it not? Throw in the guest director Quentin Tarantino and the buzz meter soared into the red. Could this be the Pearl Harbour of 2005? Sin City starts off as promising as their ads. Bruce Willis is Hartigan, the only true good guy in a cast of shady characters, and we pick up Hartigan on the trail of a pedophile/kidnapper/murderer played by Nick Stahl. A standoff on a city dock leaves Hartigan will multiple bullet wounds and the kidnapper with two less appendages. It's a violent and visually energizing scene in black and white that sets the tone for the rest of the film.<br/><br/>Enter one Marv (Mickey Rourke), who wakes up beside a dead hooker. Marv is one ugly dude, but is a brawler with nothing to lose. The cops are already racing up the stairs and Marv is quick to realize that he has been set up. His story  the most interesting of the three told in Sin City  would lead him to a farm where a sadistic cannibal (played by a very eerie Elijah Wood) eats his prey and mounts the heads of his victims like deer heads over a mantle.<br/><br/>The second story surrounds a group of female renegades (lead by Rosario Dawson) who when provoked by Jackie Boy (Benicio Del Toro) and his band of merry men lay a beating on the boys leaving severed arms and heads on the city street. A revelation that Jackie is a police officer requires the aide of Dwight (Clive Owen) to assist with the disposal of the body parts.<br/><br/>The third story brings us back full circle. Hartigan is released and attempts to trace the girl (Jessica Alba) whom he saved from the Nick Stahl character years earlier. A mysterious yellow man is hot on his trail and when the two do reunite, Mr. Yellow is revealed to be the kidnapper/murderer from the first act who is looking finish what he started years ago.<br/><br/>Sin City exploits just about every R-rated check box the MPAA censors have on the clipboards in front of them. There are dismemberments, shootouts, violence against women and police, crotch shooting, crotch ripping, suggested acts of cannibalism and in maybe the scene that will stick with you the longest, someone is left without limbs and tied to a tree for a dog to feast upon. This is not therefore your family movie after Sunday brunch. Sure, the black and white visuals of the film drop the red blood factor down to zero, but whether its fluorescent blood against a black background or yellow plasma spills in place of buckets of red, the imagination doesn't have to go far to imagine the scene in full Technicolor.<br/><br/>But I am sure that Rodriguez and Miller make no apologies. Nor will they offer your money back if you don't appreciate the art of the black and white shot film (against a green screen no less) that uses color only to create visual distractions. Red shoes and dresses, blue and yellow eyes and yellow skin are just a few examples of the scatterings of Crayola coloring utilized in the print. Never distracting and always interesting, it was the best use of color in a black and white shot film since the red jacket appeared in Schindler's List.<br/><br/>There are a plethora of things that are stunning in Sin City. The costumes, the music, the sets. But unfortunately, it felt after an hour and a half (the movie runs over two hours) that more time was spent on the style than trying to tighten the story lines. Cut about 20 minutes and leave them for the DVD and you have a movie that ends up on top ten lists rather than just being credited as being innovative. By the time the final story begins, you are already exhausted at everything you have been asked to ingest and that is probably too much for the average movie goer.<br/><br/>www.gregsrants.com"

","Throughout his Career Robert Rodriguez has done things his way. Making movies he wanted to make and extending the boundaries of filmaking in the 21st century. It started with El Mariachi and continues now with the cinematic achievement Sin City. This movie is unlike any other movie that has ever been released by any major studio. This is not your run of the mill comic book movie where the actors seem out of place and the scenery is overdone. Sin City is a comic book movie, and it is what comic book movies should be. Everything about it, from the amazing cinematography to the cleverly acted roles by Mickey Rourke, Clive Owen and Roasrio Dawson, fit perfectly into every single aspect of this film. Whats great about it, is that every story has an ending, there are no loose ends left on any of the films 3 story lines. Despite that, there can be a sequel because there are so many Frank Miller stories to pull from. If there is a sequel then I am looking forward to it."
"gpadillo","Null","0","3","4 April 2005"," Brutal, Beautiful, Breathtaking Sin City
","With any luck Frank Miller's ""Sin City"" will inspire a new genre of film-making - a literal union between film-making and the world of comic books/graphic novels. I know, I know, there have been countless films inspired by the world of comic books which have attempted to recreate the chills and thrills. Not one of them - even the best (e,g,, Spiderman series, Tales from the Crypt, etc.) has been remotely as successful as the creative team that gives us this brilliant, jarring, vision.<br/><br/>Rodriguez, Miller and company obviously put themselves (and the cast) through painstaking paces to assure every frame, every emotion emoted by an astonishing array of live talent is instilled with the gritty, graphic hyper-realism of the world of Frank Miller. It is a breathtaking achievement which, alas, will go unnoticed by the Academy, and under-appreciated by many who don't ""get"" this world.<br/><br/>The cast is nothing short of remarkable: Mickey Rourke gives his finest performance since Barfly - maybe ever. Bruce Willis has never given a better performance than as retiring cop, Hartigan. Everyone involved is obviously relishing having the time of their lives. Outside of Shakespeare I can't imagine anything currently more theatrically over-the-top and satisfying for an actor than being associated with Sin City.<br/><br/>For many the violence will be of too gory and graphic a nature (gorygraphic?). Others will enjoy the rough, violent and stylized ride but will also be appreciative of the often stunning beauty of so many of this film's images. The final tale in the trilogy of stories that comprise the movie's narrative is shot with the cool and chill of a winter bathed by endlessly falling snow of such exquisite beauty that I find no difficulty saying it is among the most beautiful images I've seen in any film.

","This was a great movie, but you get that distinct feeling that it would have been better if Quentin Tarantino stayed home. The first two skits were incredible and I was thrilled to see a return to the Hartigan storyline, but in between.... Eeesh! The entire third skit came off so much like Kill Bill vol. 3, I wanted to leave. It had everything: too much blood, a chick with swords, humor winking at violence, and the list of Tarantinoisms goes on. It really was good except for that small exception. Good acting, excellent storyline, great humor, and a great cast round out a good film. A fine film for movie buffs to try and name that star. I had a lot of fun doing that one. Especially cool was the comic book storyline and the way it was shot in black and white with occasional color. Very cool. A great film but if you can't stand Quentin, it's a must miss. 8 out of 10."

","I just saw Sin City yesterday and today I am planning on seeing it again. I consider myself a pretty good judge on movies and I have to say I agree with almost everything the critique on the main page has to say both good and bad (although there is very very little wrong with this movie). It most certainly is not for anyone who doesn't like violence but other than that BUY THE TICKET TAKE THE RIDE. No one will regret seeing this movie.The camera work and acting combined (its been a long time since the two have been together) make this the must see movie for the past ten years.

","The immensity of this film struck me not as I was watching it, but while I was thinking about it afterward. From a technical viewpoint, it is an incredible film. The acting is amazing, the film techniques are unique and wonderful and the special effects are mind blowing. However, all of these pale in comparison to the thematic ideas behind this film. This film is an exploration of what it truly means to be a Hero. It looks at Free Will. It looks at Sacrifice. It looks at Love. All of that capitalization is on purpose. These are big ideas. This is a huge film. It encompasses all of those ideas and wraps it up an an incredibly compelling story. When looking for comparisons, all I could do was to compare this work to the classic work of another Miller. Arthur Miller and his seminal work Death of a Salesman. Frank Miller and Robert Rodriguez have captured and exposed a part of the American psyche that many people don't want to admit. Even in the struggles of, what many people would consider, the dregs of society, there is truth, justice and, yes, even the American Way in the way these characters approach their own versions of Honor. To think that there are things to learn, even from those dark people that populate the dark world of Frank Millers Sin City. Go see this movie. You will be a better person for it."
"oliverflossin","Null","0","4","4 April 2005"," Sin City: great adaptation!
","this movie is so close to the source material in the comic that it's scary. more than LOTR, SinCity is almost frame for frame from the comics and, if you've read them, you know this is a good thing. some people are put off by the movie's violence, some shun the similarities in plot lines that run through the stories, and yet others do not appreciate the rampant nudity and confusing character developments (like that Yellow Bastard or Marv's incredible toughness), but those of you who want more than a schlocky spiderman movie made for kids will love this film. the mood is stark and dirty, the themes are of love, redemption, and revenge, and the acting is good enough (although Bruce Willis and Mickey Rourke really shine). the blood flows and scores are settled. this movie looks like the filmmakers used the comic as 'key frames' and filled in the rest to match. and, for once, mickey Rourke comes off looking like an actor instead of a really bad boxer who just happens to act occasionally, though this part was probably not much of a stretch for him. a reel piece of eye candy and action for those who want something a bit different and a great development for the true fans who feared the world might never get another crack at one of Frank Miller's masterpieces after the Batman (and Robocop) fiascos!"

","I walked out of this movie, wondering what I had just watched because there was so much in this movie. After reflecting back over the weekend I finally decided that I had to put some my thoughts out in the open. Hopefully you'll find them useful, or at least entertaining.<br/><br/>Taking pages from Dick Tracy, Pulp Fiction, Kill Bill (both volumes), with the influences of the ultra-violent Japanese pulp films (no pun intended), Robert Rodriguez and Frank Miller have re-constructed a graphic novel world that one will not soon forget. I intend to watch this film several more times to see how much I missed, because I believe this is a film that has so much going on just one viewing does not allow one to take in all the elements of the film.<br/><br/>From the score, the costumes (some of which were barely that), the characters, the lighting (yes black and white movies do have lighting effects, the transfusion of colors to enhance the significance of a scene or to foreshadow the future of the movie, and the scene sequence and how each was filmed.<br/><br/>Whether your interest is action movies, comic book based movies, or any other kind of movie - I think there is something in this movie for everyone (except the little kids). Some of the older people will remember the days of black and white serials, while others will remember the more recent movies like Hellboy and Kill Bill.<br/><br/>This is a movie to view, review and really think about. I haven't even finished thinking about it, but these are my first impressions. There isn't enough space here for me to really break out all the little nuances of the film. Enjoy the movie!"

","I saw this movie during the weekend. I never read the book, but that didn't stop me from enjoying this film. I am a big fan of Bruce Willis and I am happy to say that I wasn't disappointed with his performance in this movie. The other supporting characters in the movie were great as well. The movie is mostly in black and white, but the color that they did use were brilliant in how they used it. The story changes with different main characters throughout the movie, as it is with many movies that Quentin Tarantino is associated with. I found myself thinking of an old Humphry Bogart 1930's movie with a modern twist. In conclusion I found this movie very enjoyable, but really not for children. I give this movie a 8 out of 10."
"pete_r","10","0","4","4 April 2005"," Not a fan of graphic novels or a super movie buff, but thought it was great!
","Perhaps I can give more of an average-Joe perspective. I was never into graphic novels, and I'm not a hardcore film buff as many people on this site probably are. I pretty much didn't know what to expect, although I had heard that the movie was based on a graphic novel. I had read that the director dropped out of the Director's Guild in order to credit Miller and have Tarantino contribute, and I thought that was pretty cool. Oh, and I also knew it was going to be in black and white with a few snippets of color, and people were questioning how well that would come across. I saw Sky Captain on DVD a couple weeks ago, and I think I went to do the dishes or something while it was playing, so apparently that attempt didn't grab me. So I guess I came in with a fairly open mind and not much thought beforehand.<br/><br/>Then the over-the-top violence starts, and I immediately realized it was stylized a la Kill Bill. Personally I really don't like violence. I hate the fact that you can have shows all over TV depicting murders and autopsies and child rapists and whatnot, but show a nipple and it's the end of humanity. I don't like violence that attempts to portray real life, but this was clearly not that. Since I knew it was based on a graphic novel I ""got"" that aspect of it. My girlfriend didn't understand that at first, and had her mouth covered in horror, while I'm laughing out loud. She liked Kill Bill, and was able to settle in once I explained that it was in a similar vein.<br/><br/>I'm probably the demographic that the industry types were unsure about, and yet I thought it was an absolutely great movie. I saw it days ago, and I'm still thinking about it. The in-your-face style and raw relentlessness was a refreshing treat. I was so engrossed in the story it never occurred to me that there was CGI. Marv has to be my favorite character in years, and I can't say enough about what a wonderful job Rourke did. My review lacks the eloquence of many who are used to writing such things, but this movie rocked. That's the kind of pure, stylish entertainment you hope for when you go to the theater, and so rarely get. With caveats about the violence, I've recommended it to everyone I know, and I really hope it does even better once the word of mouth gets around."
"tonyhurl","Null","0","4","4 April 2005"," Amazing Film!
","Sin City is by far the BEST comic book adaptation I have seen come out of a major studio. Anyone that is even the slightest bit interested in film-making should go out and watch this film, sit back and be amazed at how a superb graphic novel is brought to the screen in such an artistic way. The B&W photography with splashes of color look amazing against the digital backgrounds that bring Frank Miller's work to life. Robert Rodriguez has done a great job and I would give my vote for a best director Oscar at next years Academy Awards. Art Direction and Cinematography are also worthy of awards. A great movie that should be seen by all and studied by anyone that wants to make a great comic book adaptation."

","I saw this movie yesterday and I was skeptical of seeing it simply because I don't like most comic movies. I thought it was brilliant that they were able to follow the comic so closely. I had been reading Sin City comics for years and I am greatly satisfied with the work done with this movie. If you like Kill Bill for its gore value, you would love this movie. If you like comic books, you will love this movie. If you like sadistic killers and awesome effect, you will love this movie. Mickey Rourke was a great actor for Marv. This movie is not for people who don't like sadistic killings. Personally, I love the torture and kind of killing the characters portray in this movie. This movie, like the comic, is one of a kind. I can't wait for the sequel..."
"guerdis","Null","0","4","4 April 2005"," Best comic-to-screen production yet made. A must-see.
","I must admit to a certain degree of short-sightedness. The first time I saw Frank Miller's Sin City serials in Dark Horse Presents, I never would have imagined a transition from comics to film for that work - or at least not in his high-contrast monochrome style. Thank the LAWD for technological progress.<br/><br/>I have heard some critical disdain for Sin City, but I can only wonder about these complaints. Simply for the sake of the production quality it should have gotten fair reviews and this is not to mention the excellence of the adaptation. Naturally, this would require the critics of film to be readers of comics, which is not necessarily a reasonable expectation, but the likely gulf between the opinions of fans of the book and the opinions of film critics should raise a question or two as to who is to be trusted here. In short: Film critics might be left high and dry and even confused as to why this film is so well-received.<br/><br/>Fortunately, this mystery is not the same mystery as the persistent high placement of The Pacifier at the box office. Sin City is the present king of the hill in terms of adapting a comic source. A near miracle was performed, in fact. A highly stylized 2D work was visually transported to live action without becoming horribly camp (re Dick Tracy of the 80s or Batman of the 60s). The Miller visual look and feel was ever-present without becoming more important than the stories being presented.<br/><br/>Additionally, the writing remained in the comic realm and was not forced into ""screenplay"" mode. This might have annoyed some critics, but for a comic purist, it's fantastic. To top it off, the performances of the actors, even Brittany Murphy, was flawless. There may be a flaw or two that stand out the next few times I see this film, but I can still feel confident saying that it's as close to perfect as an adaptation can get, it's as visually stunning as its source material and it managed to keep me on the edge of my seat for most of the time.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this experience. Just be ready for some potentially disturbing concepts and imagery. The faint of heart or stomach might want to consider quite carefully how much you can stand before you go. I'm fairly jaded to comic and screen violence and I was a little freaked out by some of it, so be careful there. Otherwise, get ready for an awesome ride."
"Desertdback","Null","0","4","4 April 2005"," Most Beautifully Shot Movie EVER !
","This movie didn't just look stunning, it was stunning. The visual effects in this movie weren't just for show, like in Sky Captain, they were in addition to a great script and one of the greatest cast of characters to be put together in a long time. The actors may not get as much screen time as in a par average Hollywood flick, but this movie is definitely not average for anything coming out of Hollywood these days. It is far above average of anything I have seen in a while. It was very reminiscent of Dick Tracy combined with the video game Max Payne, and maybe a little Kill Bill esqueness in there. As you can tell I not only like this movie, but it thrilled me in every way possible being a man, not only does it have beautiful women and violence to go along with, but also has a great story line and something very different, which is always better then the same lame game that Hollywood tries to throw at us each week at the box office, it was a refreshing flick that I am going to see again, which is something I rarely say and this time I really mean it !"
"Gnosys","9","0","3","4 April 2005"," Brilliant! Can't Expect Anything - and keeps surprising with excellence!
","SIN CITY was absolutely amazing. I was really looking forward to it for the past six months, kept my expectations low, and begged my friends to come see it with me. In the end, they thanked me, for showing them the best movie in the last 2 years.<br/><br/>After the year of sequels and hits (2003) we thought it would be a while for good movies to come out. There were the Matrix sequels, Terminator 3 and Lord of the Rings: Return of the King that stole the year so much, our standard of movie watching went up a bit too much. But alas, there's Sin City this year, already the best movie of 2005 and here's why: The first ingredient to the formula of an excellent movie was novelty. A black and white movie, in the 21st century, with random bright colors showing up for visual effects was superbly done considering the entire movie was shot in the studio in front of a green screen. The second ingredient was random animation, which possibly made production easier since it was mostly B&W. The animation also kept a viewer's attention on, and the enthusiasm to wonder whats gonna happen next...<br/><br/>The third, and primary ingredient for most movie watchers to enjoy: the star cast. The casting was just excellent and could not have been better. Bruce Willis, my favorite actor since the Die Hard days, finally got a break in this movie. He was a sentimental father-figure character, very similar to Hostage, but a better portrayal. He needs to bring back his cold MF attitude which we hope to see in Die Hard 4.0 where he returns as John McLane. In Sin City, he plays Hartigan, a boy scout cop who goes by the book and upon saving a 11 yr old from being raped by a Senator's sick son, goes to jail for 8 years. Upon release and hoping the girl he saved has become a bookworm, finds out she's a stripper! Now, that role is beautifully played by Jessica Alba (who would look prettier without the blonde hair-dye). Nancy, the smarter than others stage dancer who loves to do lassos and a no-nude clause in the contract makes sure she has clothes on up and down. Contrary to the posters and trailers, she wasn't there all that much.<br/><br/>Nick Stahl was also impressive in his role as Junior/Yellow Bastard. Post-Terminator 3, this has been his first major appearance, and playing a negative character (with nasty makeup on) sure added diversity to his career as an actor. <br/><br/>Another major character in the movie was the street gangster Marv, played exceptionally well by Mickey Rourke in what I would call his come back movie. The overdose of makeup and disguise ensured he did not show similarities to Bruce Willis, and an appearance to make him less human and more Jurassic. But that appearance suited the character well. Disgrunted by the killing of his one night stand hooker lying next to him, he vowed revenge on whoever did it and ran across all over Sin City in that pursuit. The hooker was played by Jamie King, who actually had nothing to do but say ""I want you"" and ""I need you."" However, Jamie King played another role of the hooker's twin sister, a concept that managed to not ruin the movie. The hooker's name was Goldie, and was appropriately shown to have golden blonde hair in the black and white picturization, which was not shown on her hot headed sister character. Overall, Mickey Rourke kicked ass! The supporting cast also couldn't fail. Carla Gugino as Marv's parole officer (with nothing to hide) did a decent job, but her nudity clause could distract a male viewer from her role. Elijah Wood, as the Harry Potter-looking cannibal killer Kevin who never spoke also did a good job with his tiny and silent Martial Arts kicks. Rutger Haur, also deserves recognition for the 5 minute role of a corrupt cardinal who shared Kevin's appetite. Michael Clarke Duncan too played a role only he could play, of a mercenary leader who wanted the Old Town girls to obey the mafioso. Old Town girls were merely prostitutes, with guns and other weapons for their own protection, and an understanding with the police and the gangs on how to run their businesses. Headed by a leather-clad Gail (played exotically well by Rosario Dawson), and protected by the Japanese assassin Miho (a mute n' cute Devon Aoki).<br/><br/>Not to forget, Clive Owen and Benicio Del Torro also deserve acclaim for their performance. Owen played Dwight, a photographer with ties to the Old Town and will beat up anybody who comes in his way. When a cop Jack Rafferty (Del Torro) tries to mess with his new bar-maid girlfriend (Brittany Murphy, in her dumb blonde, less character role), Dwight ends up in a brawl with Jack and friends, and with assistance from the Old Town girls, manages to put them away. Clive Owen is indeed James Bond material and I'd really look forward to seeing him in that role. Del Torro also excelled as a sex-starved cop.<br/><br/>Alexis Bledl took a leap from her Gilmore Girls role, and did an OK job. However, Josh Hartnett stole the show in the beginning and end as a cold-hearted, smooth-talking hit-man. Marley Shelton, all she had to do was look pretty, smile and blush. The visual effect-laden colors took care of her appearance.<br/><br/>Overall, I gave Sin City a 9/10, and I look forward to a sequel which is speculated. Revived Careers: Mickey Rourke, Bruce Willis, Carla Gugino. Escalated careers: Jessica Alba, Clive Owen, Josh Hartnett."

","Finally, Miller's work makes it to the Silver Screen without suffering the slings and arrows of Hollywood! The film was excellent in terms of both style and execution; you could tell Rodriguez was truly committed to bringing the source material to life. The casting was for the most part dead on, and the film stayed ""true to the book"" 99% of the time (the absent 1% being more or less forgivable in terms of translating the material from script to screen). My sole complaints are that the film's pace was a little too fast in certain scenes, not giving it the 'breathing room' it needed in some places; and that the nudity present in the graphic novels was toned down slightly in exchange for amping up the violence level. This is most notable at the plot-point strip club where NOBODY'S STRIPPING, which kind of detracts from the graphic, hard-edged sheen the source material delivered. In the end, though, those are two very minor quibbles over what is an overall triumph of story, style, and obvious devotion to the source material. I can't wait for more from Miller and Rodriguez."

If you have satisfaction and watching things die or blow-up or both, I present you with the everlasting gobstopper of crime films. Though most films will feed you destruction and nudity and have nothing left on the plate afterwords. Yes this film had those things, but also a multi-lined plot, a dark dramatic feel and the odd artistic portrayals of color and grays. At the end, we all applauded (There is not many films where I am remember that)though an important diplomat just gave a speech.

","Sin City is quite possibly the best movie I have ever seen... and I'm no lightweight when it comes to seeing movies. Everything about the movie was wonderful: it had just the right amount of humor, just the right amount of violence, and while it may have been a bit heavy on the sex, it hardly matters. And even then, it wasn't only a little bit heavy on the sex, so it's even less of a problem. Stylistically, the movie is pretty close to perfect, near as I can see it. The visual choices they made were just pure brilliance, in every possible way. It felt like watching a comic book. It felt like watching Frank Miller's Sin City. Which was, of course, the point. It wove the various story lines together dramatically, sensically, and artistically. Plus, the ending is just perfect. I have always had a pet peeve with people applauding movies (they can't hear you, people!), but as soon as that credit music started to play, those words began to roll, and the lights came on... I damned near gave it a standing ovation. Twice.<br/><br/>In short, Sin City is the most gratifyingly unwholesome feel-good movie I have ever seen, and I plan on giving it as much free advertising as I can possibly muster."
"nospamforyou","Null","0","3","3 April 2005"," Movie trying too hard to be a comic
","I want to start off first by stating, ""I have not read the comics"". That said, my opinion, I believe, is quite un-biased. Truthfully, the only comments I have read were from my husband's Maxim magazine while I was on the crapper. Yes, us girls read too while taking care of business. So, going forward...I paid $9 for this movie ticket, but I have to say that I wish I only would've paid $6.50. Here's why: Comic characterization is one thing and Movie characterization is another. I felt the movie tried too hard to be a comic. The Director used a different style or ""weirdness"" to portray different scenes or cells of a comic. For instance, the part with Goldie and Marv on the heart shaped bed...that same image was shown about 4 times. Also, why emphasize on Yellow Bastard's color. I think it would have been more dramatic if we saw him first in yellow and then back to black and white. This would have shown a good vs. evil power struggle if once Yellow Bastard was B&W again and then show color on Hartigan. I guess my main beef is with the cinematography. The story line was great, however I won't be going out anytime soon to buy the comics. But the whole idea has movies headed into a new direction. I'm glad I saw it, I was getting tired of Ashton Kutcher movies."

And the thing that makes it even better... Even if there had never been a Sin City book, this would still be a damn good movie. Robert Rodriguez has managed to, in one fell swoop, rewrite the rules of comic book movies, and reinvent and reinvigorate the noir genre. It's not a spoof of the genre so much as an homage, I think. It will now be placed with other classics like The Concrete Jungle or Little Ceaesar. I can only hope that all of the idiots (Lucas) that rely so heavily on CGI can learn a thing or two from this movie. Everything was done right and Sin City is a beautiful movie."

","I have already seen Sin City twice since it's release two days ago. In the second viewing, I noticed something interesting about the colors. I was thinking that there had to be a reason why the director/editors decided to show some things a certain color so I tried to figure it out. In the movie, only red, green, yellow, and blue are used as colors contrasting to the black and white. The red color (besides blood) was used only on the 'good' characters. Examples would be Dwight's red converse shoes and the Hartigan's? red car. Green was shown twice in two character's eyes: Cardinal Roark and the woman in red in the beginning. I thought maybe this could symbolize corruption? The last two colors, blue and yellow were only used on the 'bad' characters such as Jackie Boy's blue car and the obvious YELLOW bastard. Maybe this is already a known fact or maybe I'm making something out of randomness but I thought I'd share in case anyone had comments on it. Obviously I liked the movie because I've seen it more than once and I agree that the Quentin Tarantino being advertised so much was pretty lame. True, some people would go out and see it soley because he had a part in it but still...I think it shouldn't be about that. Anyways, I'd like to hear if anyone agrees or disagrees with me about the color thing. Thanks!"

","This is the kind of film that lets you know right from the beginning that you are in for the ride of your life. From beginning to end the story's that they tell are powerful, involving, and yes, extremely violent.<br/><br/>One thing that I found intriguing was the structure of the story. It was reminiscent of Pulp fiction in this manner. You get introduced to one character and you see his story unfold, then the next, then the next. But what is really great is how they brought other character's into the other persons story. During Micky Rourks bit you get a glimpse of Clive Owen and then after Mickey Rourk is finished they tell you why Clive was there. In the end everything comes together in a very interesting way.<br/><br/>As for cinematography, I have this to say. I'm a film student right now, the second I go pro I'm using HD and only HD because if that the kind of look you can get out of it there is no reason to spend the extra money on the 35 mm film camera's. For what they were trying to do with this film High Definition was the only way to go. They made ever element of Sin City, including the actors look smooth. And the composition of the shadows was absolutely amazing.<br/><br/>The acting in and of itself would usually not impress anyone if it was not for the overall feel of the film. Really what you got were performances reminiscent of the 1930s noir films like ""Double Indemnity"" or the ""Maltese Falcon"". Of coarse these are very different stories but they still bare some basic similarities that made performances like this motivated, and even more powerful than they would have been had the simply gone with what we consider now to be proper acting style.<br/><br/>I am usually a big opponent of the use of voice over but it was used perfectly in this movie. It was needed and it was completely motivated. Of coarse, voice over is a common element in the noir genre and that still holds true for neo-noir films such as this. It opens a window to there innermost thoughts and allows us to see a full human even if we only get to follow his story for a little while. It also worked simply because of the phenomenal writing. It was witty, it was intelligent, it was funny, and it was at the same time serious. Really top notch writing.<br/><br/>This is a film that you will never forget and I guarantee you I will see it a couple more times before it hits DVD. The bottom line is, to miss ""Sin City"" while it is in theater's is to simply let cinematic history pass you by."

Like 'Fight Club', which had two great messages(don't become too materialistic and take responsibility for your own actions), 'Sin City' has a message that followed me home as much as the cannibalistic Kevin: love conquers all. Now don't get me wrong, I loved the stylish presentation (especially the way the director utilized color), the director's faithfulness to the source material, the memorable characters, and the dozen or so times my jaw dropped because I couldn't believe what they just showed on the screen. But, when one can look past the violence, blood, and women's mammary glands displayed (seriously, leave the kids at home), the message is just that simple. Because, let's face it, as big and tough as Marv is, even he wouldn't have been able to keep going except for that one thing: love. Same thing with Dwight, and his feelings for Gail-that's why they were victorious. Same thing with Hartigan and Nancy-that's why he saved her-twice-and that's why he did what he did at the end. Such a simple message-love conquers all-presented so stylishly on the big screen, definitely deserves recognition. I say well done to everyone who brought it all together for us to view and enjoy. At least I know I enjoyed it-I hope you do, too."

","Finally, a director comes along and pays homage to a type of film that you hardly ever see anymore in cinema. I am speaking about film noir. Sin City is a masterpiece in film noir. In order to appreciate film noir, you need to know some of its origins. It is not a genre but a mood or tone of film. Film noir evokes the moods of melancholy, alienation, disillusionment, moral corruption and paranoia. The films of noir were imported to Hollywood by émigré film makers. Film noir is rooted in German Expressionism of the 1920s and an excellent example of that is the movie ""Cabinet of Dr. Caligari."" Film noir really took hold in Hollywood during the 1940s with such classics as John Huston's ""The Maltese Falcon"" and Orson Welle's ""Citizen Kane."" Both these films made their debut in 1941.<br/><br/>This is why Sin City is going down in American Cinema as classic film noir. Robert Rodriguez directed it and has done a superb done. Quentin Tarantino gets credit as a guest director. When those two collaborate, watch out! You can see some of his influence to the film as well when you view the ultra-violence. It is so mesmerizing to watch because it is filmed like a detective comic book. The scenes are filmed in black and white and color placed strategically in the scenes to make certain features stand out such as a female character's red lipstick or blue eyes.<br/><br/>One of the actors that really stands out is Mickey Rourke's character named Marv. I thought this actor was a has-been until I saw him in this role. The role really shows Rourke's acting talents because the character was made for him. He not only plays Marv, he is Marv. It is gritty and comical at the same time. This role could help Rourke revive his acting career.<br/><br/>Another stand-out performance is by Jessica Alba. She is not only beautiful to watch on screen but she plays a good heroine. I hope to see her in more movies in the future. She is so natural and stunning on screen that you cannot help but root for her character. Did I say she is beautiful? Let's talk about the sexiness of the characters. All the actresses are dressed to kill. You see butt cheeks, so guys, you might want to leave the little lady at home and go with the boys to this one. Women are also slapped around a bit on screen too. This follows the true film noir detective story. There are usually two kinds of women in film noir. They are either trustworthy or predatory. One thing is for certain, every female character is hot. I mean they are gorgeous! This film really blew me away. The dialogue is smart and the cast is sexy. What more do you need for a night of entertainment? I can see some of the lines in this movie becoming classic one-liners on the same vein as ""Scarface"" one-liners. If you want to see something new and refreshing plop down your money for this cinematic work of art. Rodriguez transports you to a place that is dark and corrupt. It's not just cinematography that grabs you. The acting is first rate too. Bruce Willis does an excellent job as a good cop. Another excellent performance is by Clive Owen. If you are not familiar with Clive Owen, go see him in the Mike Nichol's film ""Closer"". He is an incredible actor with range. He should be the next James Bond. He is cool man, real cool. Benicio Del Toro and Brittany Murphy's performances were amazing too.<br/><br/>One thing I need to point out. This film is not for everyone. Some people are not going to like it. These are the people in the audience that didn't get it when I saw it. The violence is over the top so in a way it is rather comical. However, some women will find the movie offensive so guys, I don't know if this would be a good date flick. Some are going to find it more offensive than entertaining. It's your call. I just know what I like and I really dug it."

","A delight, both to listen to and to watch. A true homage to Frank Miller's original books, Sin City weaves together stories that we are both repulsed by and attracted to; these characters, though raw and hard-boiled they may be, have souls among the ghosts that populate Basin City. What we have is Frank Miller's classic tragedy of good vs. evil; though no bad man goes unpunished in SIn City, no good man does either. Our heroes, namely Marv and Hartigan, are martyrs for justice. Though not beyond using ultra-violent, unconstitutional interrogation methods, we know that these are the ""good guys."" SIn City presents a series of stories that Americans can relate to in the post 9-11 world; good people dying to dispense justice."

","May contain spoilers. see for yourself.<br/><br/>Sin City. full of black and white. splashes of color. strip bars. strippers. crooks. cops. crooked cops. revenge. vengeance and gore. oh yea it's gory as hell. Sin City follows three characters over the time of basically one night or so. with exception of Willis and Rourke. <br/><br/>Sin City is amazing to look at, and wonderful to sit through. though it is gory and bloody, the acting and story lines plus characters waters it all down. the cast is wonderful and amazing. the story: the first full story we dive into is the story of a crook and thug that basically can't be killed. he is a Big for-headed, big mouthed, but love-able kinda guy. Marv,(Micky Rourke) we hear his over voice and from the start we wanna know more about him. we see him make love to Goldy, then a cannibal messed up serial killer( Elijah Wood) walks in and shoots her dead, which throws Marv into a world of hurt. cops then storm in on the dead broad and Marv and he realizes he's been set up, so now he goes on a killing spree on search for Goldies killer and the person who set him up. this story is known to Frank Miller fans as ""Sin City."" Marv runs into unforgettable characters, like a stripper who is actually Goldies twin sister. and a parole officer that lets him drug up and kill. Rourke is wonderful to watch. and Elijah is terrifying.<br/><br/>the next story that we come to look into , is known to Miller fans as "" The big Fat Kill"" it follows a photographer, Dwight ( Clive Owen) who loves his women. by day he hangs with a blonde little stripper ( Brittany Murphey) and at night he stalks ""OLD TOWN"" with a hot little Uzi token diva ( Rosario Dawsen.) we follow him when he tries to avenge the hurt a scummy cop , Jacky Boy ( Benecio Del Toro), Puts on the little blonde stripper. and when he follows Jacky Boy to ""Old Town"" and the strippers, who run the town, put some hurt on Jacky Boy it's up to Dwight to get rid of the bodies, but instead gets framed for a murder by the chief of police in Basin City who thinks Jacky Boy died for being loyal. the gold eye brute of a chief ( Micheal Clark Duncan) then puts out a hunt on Dwight and a certain head that Dwight is carrying. and when The Uzi Diva is kidnapped the story ends with a bang. Dwight encounters bad guys of his own, including Jackie Boy, and Irish phsycoes that love killing. Mentioning form this story goes to a great performance by Clive Owen, Brittany Murphy, Dawson. and good directing by Miller and QT.<br/><br/>The last and final story, actually starts the movie off, with a soon to be retired cop, Hartigan ( Bruce Willis)who saves a young girl ( Jessica Alba) from the rapist ,Junior ( Nick Stahl.) but he doesn't make it very far, and instead gets shot up and incarcerated for raping the young girl who falls in love with the corrupt cop for saving her life, because she knows the Truth but no one will listen. we then shoot to 8 years later, when Hartigan goes ona search for this young woman who is now a erotic stripper, and on his look he is being stocked by ""The Yellow Bastard"" (who is also played by Nick Stahl.) and through finding himself, Hartigan seduces the young girl(Alba) without knowing it, and he falls in love only to find himself defeated in the end. Great characters are involved in this story as in the rest. Bruuce Willis is great, and Nick Stahl is creepy and very lovable as an evil jerk.<br/><br/>The characters and stories are just toppings on the cake. the stuffing lies with the way the stories intertwine, the direction(which is outstanding and brilliant) and the artistic view the directors took to make this outstanding movie. This is the best Comic to Movie, movie ever. Frank Millers characters and drawings come alive on screen with the help of director , Robert Rodreguez. Robert, not only brings the liveliness to his filming and imagery that he does with how he wants the characters to be. each actor kind of just molds into their character and you don't believe your watching actors on the screen. unlike other comic movies, who take the characters and make new story lines to fit ""real-life"" this movie doesn't take a realistic point of view at all!<br/><br/>It is gory and may make you wanna puke in some shots. but the gore is not distasteful and the really gory stuff is done off screen. Rodreguez, Miller, Rourke, Owen, Willis my hat is off to you. you made a brilliant comic book into a wonderful delightful movie. 10/10"

","The books are comparable to the movie. Some actual shots in the movie are the same as panels from the comic. That is why Rodriguez(the director) had Frank as co-director . The movie is very bloody and leans a little more towards realistic violence even though the violence can get sickening. In comparison to the anime movies Hokuto No Ken and Akira, not that much blood is spilled. There are more certain realistic consequences in the film even though certain sequences probably couldn't/wouldn't/shouldn't be done in real life.<br/><br/>I didn't read all of ""That Yellow Bastard"" before the movie, but then the first part of the movie follows the first part of that graphic novel directly.<br/><br/>I found the movie so good, I am planning to rent it when it gets released on DVD."

","Sin City is indeed a watchable, and for the most part highly entertaining film. Did it live up to its hype (I mean, I've been anticipating this for almost 6 mos)? <br/><br/>Not so much.<br/><br/>It starts great, with the segment introducing Bruce Wiliis' character, and sets the tone for yet more of the super-stylized ultra violence that we've come to relish in Rodriguez's films.<br/><br/>(And when big Quinty is listed as a 'special guest director', you just know there's gonna be a whole lotta genital-mutilatin', limb-choppin fury. You know, for the kids...)<br/><br/>The story line featuring Mickey Rourke as Marv is great, a good story well told. Then the film hits a big fat lag.<br/><br/>They could have trimmed twenty minutes out of this and had a real good, tightly connected series of vignettes that really would have sent me home loving it and wanting more.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, I love del Toro's work, but the whole hooker-sequence-with-lotsa-misogeny, and little killer Miho (or whatever the hell her name was) just went on and oooonnnnnnn.<br/><br/>I know I'm not into a piece when I find myself looking at my watch to see how much longer it could drag out, ya know what I'm saying? <br/><br/>Plus, you know, I'm getting tired of the flying Chinese superchicks that are all the rage among the Tarantino-esque set for the last three years.<br/><br/>Ditto for the d'enouement, with Bruce Willis confronting the yellow guy whose appearance turned the whole thing into a lame-ass Star Trek-era makeup retread. And whose whole dialog and raison d'etre have been done so many times.<br/><br/>Pity, too, as I was SO hyped after the first couple of stories.<br/><br/>Bottom line: Sin City is alright, but only alright. You wont regret it if you wait for the DVD release, but it is worth a look at some point. Heaps of style (albeit derivative of a lot of other recent movies, most notably Sky Captain and a lot of great Asian cinema like Casshern)<br/><br/>Its a better than average film, and I love Rodriguez's work. It just ain't no Once Upon a Time in Mexico."
"MichaelMargetis","9","0","1","2 April 2005"," Bold and Mesmerizing! By Far the Best Comic Book Film Adaptation Ever Made!
","Sin City has to be one of the most inventive films I have ever gazed my eyes upon. The minute it starts, it reels you into a world full of blood, mayhem, sex, black-and-white imagery and a hell of a lot of cigarette smoking. Along with being the most inventive and cool film of the year so far, it is also the best. Based on the provocative graphic novels by Frank Miller(also the film's co-writer/co-director), Sin City is so full of life you will probably have to see it twice to grasp it's greatness.<br/><br/>The movie is built solidly around 3 1/2 stories. The first (well 1/2 a story) is the three minute opening scene of the film. It features a love crossed woman (Mary Shelton) and a mysterious man who comes to her rescue (Josh Hartnett). The other three stories (which take place after an amazing opening credit sequence) are when the movie really starts to get interesting. The first is about a hardened super-hero-ish criminal on parole, Marv (Mickey Rourke) who has a one-night stand with a hooker, Goldie (Jamie King), and wakes up later that night to find her murdered. Marv goes on a mission to avenge her death by the hands of an eccentric mute cannibal rapist, Kevin (played by Mr. Frodo himself -- Elijah Wood) and a corrupt Cardinal of the Roman Catholic Church, Cardinal Roark, (Rutger Hauer -- in a scary role.) Interfering with Marv's plans are his lover, Goldie's, hooker friends led by Goldie's sister Wendie (played also by Jamie King) and Marv's parole officer (played by Carla Gugino). This is my favorite segment of the three.<br/><br/>The second (and longest) story involves a battle between a good guy, Dwight (played by Oscar nominee Clive Owen) and a corrupt police lieutenant of Sin City, Jackie Boy (played by Oscar winner Benico Del Toro) which starts as a dispute over a cocktail waitress at a bar, Shellie (Brittany Murphy). This battle involves conflict from the government, mafia, hookers (Alexis Bledel and Rosario Dawson), a nasty female assassin named Miho (played by Devon Aoki) and a crazed gang leader (The Green Mile's Michael Clarke Duncan). This segment involves a scene directed by Quentin Tarantino, in which Dwight has a conversation with a corpse in the front seat of a bright red 65' Cadillac.<br/><br/>The third and final story of this film-noir saga, involves one of Sin City's last clean and honest cops, John Hartigan (Bruce Willis) and his mission to save a beautiful young stripper, Nancy Callahan (Jessica Alba) from a deranged mutated yellow-skinned kiddie rapist/murderer named the Yellow Bastard (played by Carnivale's Nick Stahl). The Yellow Bastard's father is the Senator of Sin City, and brother of Cardinal Roark. In this segment, Hartigan was framed for the rapes and murders of the Yellow Bastard and tries to clear his name, while the Yellow Bastard, Senator Roark (Powers Boothe from HBO's Deadwood) and Hartigan's old partner Bob (Kill Bill Vol. 2's Michael Madsen)try to stop him.<br/><br/>Sin City is excellent in so many different aspects, but it also has some flaws. Some of the film's story is hard to follow because there is so much of it. They literally jam back 2 ¾ hours of material into a 2 hour and six minute film. Although most of the acting is spot-on in Sin City (Willis, Rourke and Owen are spec-tac-ular in the three lead roles -- especially Rourke), some people like Brittany Murphy and Brittany Murphy (whoops did I mention Brittany Murphy?) suck more then a vacuum cleaner. Thank god she had a minimal role so she didn't ruin the movie for me. Brittany Murphy does a poor job, but the villains in the film (Powers Boothe, Michael Madsen, Elijah Wood (oh no, Frodo!), Rutger Hauer, Michael Clarke Duncan  and especially Nick Stahl and Benico Del Toro)are too perfect for words. <br/><br/>All in all Sin City holds the title for me as the best comic book film adaptation of all time. It's a terrific film filled with wonderful surprises and I'd recommend you all to see it (just don't bring kids 11 and under  parents be forewarned it contains sexual situations, gratuitous nudity and extremely graphic and creative violence.) I reserved a spot for Sin City on my end of the year top 10 list. Bring on Sin City 2, with three more stories from Frank Miller's graphic novel series. Grade: A-<br/><br/>MADE MY TOP 300 LIST AT #126"

","OK so...on the whole this movie was pretty bad ass. not having ever seen or read frank millers comics i got most of this movie. there's just some minor beefs i have with it and i think the might come from me never having read the comics. <br/><br/>who/what is josh hartnett's character? he appears in the very first and very last scenes as a killer but for whom? and why?<br/><br/>i wasn't sure if the stories were all supposed to be connected with each other or not because the only constant in them was shellie and the bar but then i read that its sort of pulp fictiony so that made it OK.<br/><br/>and this is the part part that bothered be the most (my spoilers in hear so i hope to god that no one who hasn't seen sin city reads this) Bruce Willis killing himself was totally pointless to me. i understand that it was a callback from the ""an old man dies and a little girl lives"" line from the beginning but him dying just to make that line fit was a bit much. if it was me and i was Rourke, Nancy would be dead anyway. if the one guy on earth i wanted to kill more than any other killed himself and i didn't get to do it and there's only one person left to take it out on (Nancy) shed be dead in 2 seconds. at least if he stayed alive he could have tried protecting her. that would have made more sense. but then i thought i might have been missing something from the comics. <br/><br/>so if anyone could clear up the josh hartnett thing and Bruce Willis offing himself id appreciate it. sorry if i ruined this for you."

","I am new to the world of Frank Miller and his work but I did read his Dark Night Return's book which I thought was extremely well written at the time. This movie literally blows away any comic book movie I've seen before both plot wise and artistically. Personally I'm sick of superheros that wear masks and fight some retard bad guy that also has some corny super power.<br/><br/>Sin City is much more satisfying for me due to the fact that its based on a story of vengeance and payback where the enemy deserves to die and the audience roots when justice is delivered. There is a lot of violence and gore to this movie but the good thing is that it all fits in with the storyline and you don't get a feel that its overdone. The acting was great and the movie was ten times better than that of Sky Captain.<br/><br/>So if you want to see a great action/ thriller than this is a must. But be sure to leave the kids at home. Never mind, I saw them in the audience anyway."

","I have not read Frank Miller's ""graphic novels"", though after seeing Sin City it is obvious that Robert Rodriguez used Miller's frames as a verbatim story board. The result is mixed. I understand that the dialog is supposed to be cheesy and noirish to go with the brilliant visuals, but at times the whole thing was just way too over the top for my tastes. Never have I seen a more gory film, though the presentation is so unique that the disgust level is minimal. Mickey Rourke's performance is Oscar worthy. Jessica Alba's performance is not Oscar worthy, but one that no male will forget soon. It is nowhere near a classic, but a fascinating experiment definitely worth seeing."

An all-star cast portraying outrageous characters from Frank Miller's comic books from the infamous Sin City. The movie is of course in all black and white which gives it the perfect mood for the reaction and attention such a film deserves. There are exceptions when the directors wanted to accentuate something, but it compliments the symbolic meaning it portrays. I won't say anymore other than it is the most explicit movie I have ever seen which may or may not be to a viewer's liking. I have never seen anything like this and hope this is some sort of generational awakening to new movie viewers who like their movies uncensored. Get to the theaters and don't bother with refreshments because you may not hold it down. Prepare for a highly entertaining film unlike anything you've ever seen before.

"chickentonight3","9","0","4","3 April 2005"," Wow, I've already read this movie...
","...and it's still great. But definitely different. I didn't know what exactly to expect after the opening scene with Josh Hartnet, and after seeing it I understand why everyone has said everything they've said about this movie. The acting isn't really a mixed bag, it's just a different style of acting. It's intentionally over the top. Same with the violence and the characters themselves, this isn't a realist film. This way too cool to be a realist film.<br/><br/>What set the tone for me is and was my guide-track for the rest of the flick was Micheal Madsen's portrayal of Hartigan's partner. I couldn't help but gasp in wonder at what I was watching. It seemed off, compared to what I've seen him do before. He's not a bad actor, so why is his performance so laughable in the delivery? Whatever the reason, it was consistent throughout the performance so it obviously was intentionally done in the way it was. Well, beside Madsen's performance, I felt that the acting was great, with Mickey Rourke and Bruce Willis being the standouts. Jessica Alba did fine with what she was given to work with - any problem you've got with the character or the dialog or whatever, that's because it was written like that. I personally found her to fit the character fine and she did a great job.<br/><br/>Another example of this different style of acting was in the scene at the beginning of The Big Fat Kill, where Jacky Boy is trying to get into the apartment and Britney Murphy, with her back to the door, sort of strikes a pose (write out of the comic) and delivers the lines. That sort of took me out of the experience. In fact several moments like that took me out of the movie and made me think of what it was I was watching. There was one shot in particular of Marv spinning in the middle of a spiral pattern that made me realize I was watching the comic.<br/><br/>My only gripe, which goes against the dopes who're complaining that at 2 hours and 6 minutes the movie is way too long (whereas pulp fiction was 2 and a half and the LOTR were all over 3 hours, go figure people), there is one moment near the end of the movie where I thought they should've held on it for an extra 3 seconds or so. If they had done that, then the end wouldn't seem like a drawn out action sequence, but would instead have the audience wanting the hero to take out the villain, to get the happily ever after noir story, which would've made the payoff at the end actually pay off. Sorry if that doesn't make much sense, but I don't want to blow the story for you guys. Other than that it was great and compelling in terms of the story that was being told, and perhaps something was lost in merging the stories together to form the feature film length but it was a hell of a lot of fun."

","I am a comic book fan. I am also a film/movie fan. And I mostly get involved when the two mediums cross over into one another. But, on occasion they disappoint. Let's take for example Daredevil. I think we can all come to the consensus as film fans that it was not a very well done movie, and us comic book fans register it up there as one of the worst Comic book movies of all time. But Sin City is in a world of it's own.<br/><br/>Before going to the movie, I hadn't read any of Frank Millar's Sin City books. I'd read some of the other stuff he'd done for Batman: Dark Knight, etc, and was impressed by his use of words. I had also seen once upon a time in Mexico, so I thought that the movie would be at least as good as Rodriguez's last film. But after 10 minutes in the theatre I was blown away.<br/><br/>The Shots were near perfect. I'd seen some pictures of the comic in the last Wizard Magtazine I'd been reading, and the panels from the Grapohic Novels look uncannily similar to what you see in the finished film, easy enough to do with a completely digital set. Also, the black and white element with certain things in color to show their importance, was another brilliant feat, and something that I will always wonder how they do in the film medium. So the visuals as I've said, I freakin' loved.<br/><br/>The Script is just as brilliant. It uses all of Millar's wordplay and beautiful descriptors while not having to resort to poor tactics that film usually employs that Comics usually can do in a Narrative or a thought bubble. But if you've gone to see the movie and wonder why there is so much narration, it's because that is how Millar does his comics. it's nearly all narrative, and it is something I believe that film companies are desperately afraid of. They fear we may get bored, walk out, hate the movie, but I think that they don't give us enough credit. If employed like Rodriguez/Millar did in Sin City, there is no time for us to get bored because we are glued to the screen 99.9% of the time.<br/><br/>Lastly, they no holds barred attitude toward the film sealed the deal for me. I only found this out after I'd seen the movie. Afterwards I went out and bought 3 Sin City graphic novels to see what else Millar had written and developed through these characters and was totally amazed at how much they had actually used in th movie. Usually in films about comics, the backgrounds are changed, or specific elements are made different so as to adapt it to our believability of the film. But with Sin City we are expected to use our willing suspension of disbelief and embrace everything that has been on the page that was then transferred to the screen. beautifully done, in my opinion.<br/><br/>Some of you may not like the certain points of dialogue where it sounds stilted, or cheesy, or campy, but the point of Sin City is to have it be Hardboiled Film Noir, and if you read up on the media Sin City (the movie and the Comic) is based on you'll see that it fits right in. Perfect in it's place. And I've also heard some complaints about following the storyline. And all I can say is either go see it again, or take each story as it comes on it's own, independent of ll the other 4. Either way, there is very little about this movie to complain about. Someone may pipe up bashing the fact that all the women in the film are prostitutes, but alas none as we know them.<br/><br/>The movie is a hardboiled, beautiful, visual festival of true comic to movie genius and I hope that people will find the movie as intriguing as I have.

","this movie is one of the best movies i have seen and for me that is saying something because i have seen many movies in my life and so far there is only two that i can say are like the best movies ever which is this Sin City and Spider-Man 2. But what i like about this movie is well everything the acting, the filming the black and white scenery and only having a few things in the scene in color and especially the all the actors/characters and the biggest part the story and i think everyone should see this movie. one of my favorite parts is when Jessica Alba was dancing on the stage and got a nice look at her somewhat covered fine ass. what do other people think and i can't wait for Jessica alba's next movie The Fantastic Four"

","Sin City is an interesting, hyper stylized little film that I can recommend, along with the cautionary heads up notice of the existence of a couple of problems. That's the simplest thing I can say about the movie. There are some great performances in terms of the nailing of characters from the source down perfectly but at the same time, there was one thing about the whole package that bugged me and I realized what it was just before the halfway mark of the movie. The movie is very faithful to the original Frank Miller graphic novels, with most of the film draped in shadows and dialogue that sounds like it was written by Chandler's ghost and while it is admittedly cool as all hell to actually see a project like this on the screen (projected digitally no less...), I couldn't shake the feeling that maybe, just maybe, the film was being a little TOO faithful to the novels. I felt that the movie didn't flow quite as well as it should have, mainly because it seemed to me the filmmakers were a little too obsessed with recreating every frame down to the last detail, so much so that it felt too obvious and aware of itself in a lot of the scenes. I felt like many of the performances were hampered by the restrictions on them placed by having to stick so closely to the graphic novels. Some of the dialogue scenes seemed to go on forever also, dragging the film in between moments of breathless violence, which were pretty intense. Don't get me wrong, it was still really fun to watch some of these pros in action, especially Benicio Del Toro, Bruce Willis, Clive Owen and Elijah Wood who turns in a fantastically creepy turn as a silent cannibal in possession of some serious fighting skills. His character along with Yellow Bastard (Nick Stahl, reminding us that the kid can play a really hateful character as well as the savior of the free world from the machines) gives the film a good amount of energy that good villains can bring to a story. Mickey Rourke gets a special mention from me for his work as Marv and proves as many others have done in the past before him that the world loves a great comeback as much as it loves to watch people get torn down. He's probably the best reason I can give you to watch this film, as he is arguably the heart and soul of it. The best performances come from those you normally expect to deliver, really. Some of the other performances kind of reeked with Michael Madsen coming to mind and Rutger Hauer doing more overacting than usual. Devon Aoki was awesome as Miho and Carla Gugino is going to be remembered fondly after this one, believe me. Jessica Alba didn't impress me too much character wise but damn, she's something to see, moving the way she does. The women are photographed with a lot of love and it's in this way that the movie really works hand and hand with the rest of the visuals. Some of the CGI is a little too obvious for my tastes but the look is perfect for this sort of thing in a way. Technically, the film is awesome but maybe it's just my appreciation for practical effects that makes me wish that there was less computer gimmickery. I can't help but wonder what this film would've been like if it had been shot on location rather than in front of a green screen. It's a cool effect that draws too much attention to itself after a while. In the end though, Robert Rodriguez made up for the all star vomit fest that was Once Upon a Time in Mexico with this. I have to give him credit for attempting something like this and I'd really like to see another Sin City movie done in the same way. Lastly, I also loved the music in the film. <br/><br/>Sin City is a well produced gimmick film that regrettably starts to wear a little thin. I started getting a little tired of the whole idea soon after it started but these are dismissible gripes considering that there were still so many things to enjoy about it then there were to dislike. This is definitely one to see in the theaters, especially if you want to see a different kind of comic book movie and something pretty original.<br/><br/>RATING: ***1/2 out of *****."

","having only recently been indoctrinated into the callous world of the sin city comics, i wasn't sure that i would be able to judge the movie fairly. months earlier when i first read them, i loved the overall feel and pace to them and friends and i would discuss how a movie version of this should go off. as information became more available i became more assured that the movie would be great. Robert Rodriguez as director? super. mickey Rourke as Marv? bonanza! but still an inkling of fear remained that the ratings board would nueter the film and derail the overall quality. surprise surprise when this movie came out pound for pound every bit as violent as Natural Born Killlers (a movie that had an infinite amount of problems with the fascist MPAA) and yet raised not an eyebrow.<br/><br/>then the film comes out on April fools day. what a set up. i must say that i have not been this impressed with a comic book movie since the first batman in 1989. robert rodriguez met and exceeded all expectations by dogmatically adhering to the novels themselves. the movie was born free of director and actor ego that often muddles good work. performances by Rourke, Willis, Alba, and the rest are exactly right. the look and feel of the film is wonderful. the violence is far enough over the top and the female nudity sprinkled generously enough that a warm feeling settled in my stomach by movie's end i like the wittle wittle movie oh course, said nudity and violence does seem to slow by the end to a crawl but i think the director planned it that way to reverse the common action picture logic of a final build up of violence/chase sequence/confrontation et cetera. here instead the violence is unleash from the word go, and then the movie changes gears and the director says, ""okay, you've seen this, now look at this"".<br/><br/>brilliant ten out of ten and hey i'm one of the first voters"

"Polter-Cow","8","0","1","2 April 2005"," Quite possibly the noirest movie I have ever seen
","I'm not going to tell you that *Sin City* is brilliant and the best movie of the year and visually stunning and unlike anything you've ever seen, because I'm sure you've heard it all before. I'm going to tell you why you should see it.<br/><br/>You should see it if you're a fan of the noir genre. This is quite possibly the noirest movie I have ever seen, and this includes actual noir like *Sunset Boulevard* and *The Big Sleep*. It is positively drenched in noir, from the black-and-white look to the hard-boiled characters, stories, and dialogue. I will give one word of warning here: the movie will feel ""off"" to you in the first ten minutes since it's highly stylized. But you'll get used to it.<br/><br/>You should see it if you're a fan of comics. Because this will let you see how it might look if you literally transferred a graphic novel from the page to the screen, which is essentially what Robert Rodriguez did. As you watch, you can practically see the panels on paper.<br/><br/>You should see it if you love voiceovers. Because there are a hell of a lot of them, so much so that it often feels as if you're being told a story by the characters. This is, of course, a noir convention.<br/><br/>You should see it if you like Carla Gugino's breasts.<br/><br/>You should see it if you love movies. The way that they can transport you to another world, and for two hours or so, they can so completely engross you that nothing in your own life even seems to exist, all that matters is what's transpiring on the screen.<br/><br/>You should see it if you enjoy a bit of the old ultraviolence. This movie is not for children. Do not take your five-year-old sister, for God's sake. But if you can appreciate guns, arrows, grenades, swords, clubs, and ninja swastikas, then you're golden.<br/><br/>You should see it if you can't tell the difference between a hero and an antihero, and maybe you think there's no real distinction.<br/><br/>You should see it if you liked how in *Pulp Fiction*, three self-contained stories ending up being connected.<br/><br/>You should see it if you can handle gore, ranging from missing limbs to...more missing limbs.<br/><br/>You should see it if you want to see Alexis Bledel show a little range.<br/><br/>You should see it if you want to see something different. Not only visually, but stylistically as well, down to the narrative.<br/><br/>You should see it if you want to see a really good movie. Look, maybe I wasn't physically wowed by it, and I'm not feeling all giddy. But you know when every aspect of a movie, from the acting to the writing to the directing to the everything you can possibly think of, is just so spot-on you can't think of anything to complain about? That's *Sin City*. It's extremely solid, and possibly revolutionary. Go see it."

","this is truly an ""event"" film. the trailers and publicity for this movie have been driving me crazy for months, and tonight was a culmination of a whole lot of anticipation, and a whole lot of hype. i was apprehensive at the start, focusing more on the colorized portions of the shots than any kind of exposition that was beginning, and i must admit, in the first 3 scenes, the all digital background was distracting and false. before i knew it, however, i was 30 minutes into the film without another thought to the fact that no background i was seeing exists outside of a computer. without a doubt one of the most beautiful films i have ever seen. the color, the composition, the black and whites, and the computer generated graphics coupled with costumes and prosthetics made for a thoroughly surprising and aesthetically satisfying experience. this film is not perfect. some of the actors were obviously chosen for looks or prestige rather than acting chops, but no performance is so flat that it draws unnecessary attention from itself, or distracts from other performances (mickey rourke, benicio del toro and bruce willis, notably) that are nothing short of fantastic. this is a bloody, violent, and at times sadistic piece, but the context and the universe that is created makes everything justified, if not still stomach turning. my opinions may differ slightly after a good night's sleep and some time thinking on it, but as i'm sitting here, still wet from the walk home from the theater, i am pleased, surprised, shocked, sated, and overall, satisfied. i can't wait to see it again."

Bruce Willis's performance let you know that he will continue to pick great movies and be a star in many movies to come. It may very well be the greatest comic book movie to ever be released, easily better then any of the dark comic book movies such as Constantine or Helboy. It is by far the perfect start to the summer movies, and it is hoped that comic book movies can use this as an example.

"bloojax","8","0","1","1 April 2005"," Visually stunning, yet...
","How do you describe something that on one hand is complete knockout, and on the other hand leaves something to be desired? I'll do my best to tell you.<br/><br/>Sin City is a moving comic book - to call it a ""comic book movie"" is almost a disservice. For fans of Frank Miller's source-work, it's our dream come true -- the movie we never thought we'd see rendered nearly spot-on to the books we know by heart. The visual style is the storybook panels brought to inky black and vibrant white life. The colors - brief glimpses in most places - aren't terribly distracting and actually serve certain parts well. This is a visually huge film - sit way back in the theater when you go to see it, as you need some distance from the screen to truly soak in what Rodriguez and Miller have accomplished. The CGI is 98% seamless and flawlessly rendered against the reality of the actors, and it makes for one hell of a stunning visual experience.<br/><br/>The gore factor? It's not in the ""rivers of red blood"" manner you'd expect. Example: bullets leave ragged, meaty holes in their targets, but the blood and spray is rendered in shades of gray, so the depiction is accurate -- but without true ""shocking gore."" Add to that the campiness of some of the scenes, and you get an almost unintentional comedic tone to the violence at times (when someone gets their face smashed into a wall, it gets literally smashed into the wall).<br/><br/>As for the acting...well, there's a reason I chose to comment on the story and visuals first. It's the part where the movie falls the flattest. While noir dialogue isn't Shakespeare by any stretch, it does allow you to emote - something Alba and Madsen seem not to have learned. The standouts were Rourke (great!), Willis (good), Hauer, Stahl, and Boothe -- and, not surprisingly, creator Frank Miller as a priest. They were the only ones who delivered any appreciable level of conveyed interest in their characters - especially when contrasted against Alba and Madsen, who had less life than the CGI backgrounds created around them.<br/><br/>Bottom Line? Leave the critic at home and let your inner fanboy run wild. Get swept up in the frenetic pace and over-the-top fun of it all. Let the visuals carry you past the acting holes, and enjoy the trip. 8 outta 10."

","Kay, it's time to talk Sin City, folks.<br/><br/>It's very interesting film indeed. Excellent directorial style/film editing. I love how it was all set up like an old film noir. It was a creative idea how it was mostly a black & white film, but then you'd also see bits of colour throughout, like maybe they'd show someone's eye colour for a moment, etc. Also I think it's the best comic book to screen adaptation I've seen to date. Seriously it played like something you would've read right off the page, (I even started reading some of this very recently, and I have to say all the things I read so far looked and felt familiar to me).<br/><br/>As far as acting goes, EVERYONE did a very good job (with the exception of Alexis Bledel, which aside from her attire I had a hard time picturing her as a hookershe just couldn't leave her role of Rory behind her, AND I've never really even seen the Gilmore Girls to know that's who she is, so I guess perhaps that says a lot). But everyone else was fine. Too be fan-biased of my favourite celebrity momentarily, Elijah Wood's role was, er um, 'different' to say the least. I mean I've seen him get violent in movies before (Ash Wednesday comes to mind here though I must say his costar in that Rosario Dawson did a much, much better job here in Sin City), but uh yeah that was interesting. AND unlike his above mentioned costar Miss Bledel he is proof that stars can move successfully past certain roles. Sure we'll always remember that he is Frodo, but it's not going to stop his career anytime soon because there are no more LOTR movies for him to do (so yep, no Mark Hamill syndrome for him, whew not that I was ever worried about that because he was good in a lot of things even before LOTR came along, but still good to know he's still got it) <br/><br/>So, all in all an excellent movie. Now the film geek in me is just dying to know which scene Tarantino directed, heh.<br/><br/>9/10"

","You will hear that Sin City is violent, bloody, and full of sex - the latter isn't entirely true. What makes the movie excellent is its superb story lines, acting and artistic deliverance to the audience.<br/><br/>Sin City's artistry hearkens back to film noir and dark comic books. Its characters offer a gritty, stylized look that will remind you of Pulp Fiction, without seeming as real.<br/><br/>The movie features several stories whose characters intersect briefly with each other, mostly by passing by each other in a single bar, and moving on with their tales. Each character's portrait is well done, and gives you a solid feel for them. There are some real heroes, good guys in this movie, though several are ""anti-heroes"" they are the good guys, looking out for others in this rotten, dark city-scape. Bruce Willis' character is the only straight arrow in the bunch.<br/><br/>The violence isn't gratuitous because of the black and white delivery. Some truly graphic scenes of flesh rending are shown with white silhouettes on a black background. The violence is inventive, and many times the audience gasped, laughed, or made other noises. In one scene I found myself laughing out loud with the rest of them.<br/><br/>The movie is truly engaging.<br/><br/>Without giving spoilers, it is something you need to see to understand.

I loved every sick, disturbing minute of Frank Miller's comic book-translated film 'Sin City,' for a lot of reasons. I loved that it didn't take itself too seriously; how witty and surprisingly funny the script was; and most of all how no character was completely innocent, there was no hero. everyone was a hooker, or a serial killer, or a bad cop or whatever. The movie is stylistically mesmerizing...had it been translated without any special effects or without the black and white, the excessive violence would have been a thousand times more disturbing, which could have distracted from the movie. The soundtrack was brilliant, even the acting was perfect. This movie obviously isn't for everyone; and its unconventional style and structure clearly caused a lot of critics to dislike it, but from a movie lover's point of view, I enjoyed it thoroughly."

","Mixing good old-fashioned hard boiled crime movie clichÃ©s with modern day violence and special effects, ""Frank Miller's Sin City"" explodes onto the screen with all the shock and awe that it's graphic novel source material promised. This movie is a monster: a film-noir classic on steroids raised on B-Movies. It exploits the darkest of the dark, and entertains us with it. It touches all the hungry emotions and acknowledges all the base desires we expect and want from such films. Heck, it is perhaps the ultimate example of such films, and therefore takes its place as a new classic. It is beautiful to look at, bold in its style, comic in its outlandishness, and totally audacious in its violence.

I liked El Mariachi, Desperado, and Once Upon a Time in Mexico, but no other Robert Rodriguez film is as stunning and visually outstanding as Sin City. The black-and-white visuals work extremely well. Some critics panned the film, because they seemed to think that the visual trick gets sort of old. Believe me, they are wrong. The style is great and helps to maintain the feel of Frank Miller's graphic novels. Last year, Quentin Tarantino's Kill Bill amazed me and I never thought I'd be more impressed. Although still impressed with the epic Kill Bill, I found Sin City even more impressive and entertaining. Sin City tells three stories based on the graphic novels by Fank Miller. They are: That Yellow Bastard, A Dame to Kill For, and The Big Fat Kill. My personal favorite is A Dame to Kill For, but like Pulp Fiction(my number one favorite film of all time), the other stories are still fun, creative and highly entertaining. Sin City is tons of fun and highly recommended. One of the best films since Pulp Fiction."

Sin City takes both aspects to a new level. However, the film is not simply style without substance but a very intricate and interwoven plot with unique and interesting characters. The dialogue/monologue and acting are unlike any film I have experienced. They provide precise and concise insights to the character's psyche; either that or over-the-top delivery of dialogue. All of the prementioned aspects however, work in perfect concert, such that before you realize it you have been drawn into a dark, fantastical and surreal world which exists nowhere outside of ""Sin City."""

","Regardless of who is credited as the director, Quentin Tarantino had his name written all over Sin City. Not only did it have the blood spewing violence similar to that in Kill Bill but it had stories starting and ending at different points then coming back later in the film just like Pulp Fiction. What kept this film from becoming great was its failure to make connections with each story the way that Pulp Fiction did. Had it done this, I would be talking Oscars. Instead, I'm reviewing a very good movie. Despite the long list of great actors that were in this movie, none of them turned in great performances, in fact none of them were even that good. Interestingly enough, however, due to the nature of this film, good acting was totally unnecessary. The movie was made in such a way that it felt like the actors were just reading the captions of a comic book to us. Unlike Spiderman and all the other comic book movies lately, Sin City was truly a comic book that came to life. Nearly every character's thoughts were portrayed through voice over which in a lot of cases can be considered an easy way out, in this case, it works perfectly. I'd be doing the film a disservice if I didn't comment on how artistic it is. It is clear cut, black and white which colored eyes and red blood. This alone could attract an audience but this film is much more than good looks."

","Despite ""The Matrix"", it took almost 11 years for a movie to give audiences the feeling they got when they first saw ""Pulp Fiction"". And like ""Pulp Fiction"" and ""The Matrix"", ""Sin City"" is like nothing you've ever seen on screen before. It's the birth of a new genre of movies.<br/><br/>It's absolutely Robert Rodriguez best movie (many people I know hate his movies, but I enjoyed ""El Mariachi"", ""From Dusk Til Dawn"" and even in a minor note the first two ""Spy Kids"" movies), and it possibly will be the zenith of his career.<br/><br/>The movie owns all these qualities to Frank Miller's comic series. The source of this movie is one of the most visually astonishing, cinematic works ever put on print. The fact that the movie is a carbon copy of the comic books it's both a point in its favor and a problem.<br/><br/>Yes, ""Sin City"" is not perfect.<br/><br/>I believe the movie would have benefited of a slower pace. That would have made the movie too long, but then, Rodriguez and Miller would have used a trick from the Peter Jackson School of Novel Adaptations and cut some scenes from the theatrical version and add it in a DVD for fans. Making the movie a carbon copy of the book also restricted the potential of the film medium. They could have done some scenes not featured in the comic book to connect the stories better. In all, the could have avoided the problem with the ""Harry Potter"" movies, which are a bit boring because the book to film transition was too literal.<br/><br/>""Sin City"" is not for everyone. Many people will cringe to the sometimes gratuitous ultra- violent scenes. It works in comics, but on screen may be too much. ""Road to Perdition"" was a movie that toned down the action and violence of its comic book source because of the same reasons. <br/><br/>I actually cringed at something different: Elijah Wood and Clive Owen, playing the most agile characters of the movie, display their Chuck Taylors as if they were in a commercial. This was really distracting. It happens than even in a world like nothing you've ever seen, you can't avoid some things of this world."

","Robert Rodriguez has never let me down as a first class director. If you look at the credits of this film, Robert is involved in just about every area. What Sin City offers is a fresh view on comic book adaptation. As we get bombarded by film after film of superheros, it is refreshing, to say the least, to have a film that approaches adaptation strictly from an artist's perspective. Teamed with old buddy Quentin Tarantino and having Frank Miller involved throughout the project offers us an exciting look into the actual artist's concept with excellent directing.<br/><br/>The film itself is a great page turner. It keeps you going from frame to frame as the characters rise and fall against the power of a corrupt government. Even in the end, hope is not secured. The characters in the film do it justice as I would expect from the comic. Parts that were obvious to a fan of Frank's work were apparent throughout the film. Probably none more matched than Mickey Rourke as Marv. Marv had to be my favorite character. Hartigan (Bruce Willis)was a close second in character adaptation. Both, however, had the full package and I cannot imagine anyone else playing these parts.<br/><br/>I would recommend seeing this film more than once. I think that Quentin and Robert did Sin City justice by taking on this project. An excellent job of casting and directing is what can make or break a comic book adaptation and this clearly was the best I have seen."
"elrondtheking","9","0","2","3 April 2005"," awesome piece of art
","In an age where Grand Theft Auto and other violent video games and forms of entertainment are accused of corrupting this nation's youth, ""Sin City"" explodes into theaters as a movie so violent and visually explicit that it will make Pulp Fiction look like a toned-down episode of the Tellitubies.<br/><br/>I would say with confidence that there are more than twenty graphic be-headings and amputations during the course of this film. Swords are driven through peoples eyes and arms and genitalia are constantly amputated throughout the film. The black and white style of the film is actually probably necessary to make the gratuitous violence at least non-vomit inducing. There are few violent lines that this movie does not cross and no pop-culture no-fly zones that it does not experiment with. A priest is executed in a confessional booth. Nuff said.<br/><br/>The violence being touched upon, I would not say this is a bad movie, or even a so-so movie. This movie excels with the style with which it portrays the graphic and undeniably real subject of Frank Miller's ancient comic books sharing the same name. It is humorous to think of these stories of never-ending violence and sex being sold as the same genre as Superman and Batman comics decades ago. The black an white movie in this modern age is a risk, but it pays off as the color splashes that director Robert Rodriguez throws onto characters at certain points of the movie stylistically characterize the people of Sin City in a way that the vacuous script fails to accomplish. The yellow of serial pedophile and rapist Junior makes the disgusting aura of his character leap off the screen. It becomes almost difficult to view his horribly altered body without flinching. A positive use of color is used with the subtle tan allowed for Jessica Alba's (Nancy) skin. This tan makes Alba look more irresistible than in any other movie she has appeared in because it literally gives here the appearance of being an angel among humans.<br/><br/>The only problem with this movie revolves around the aforementioned vacuous script. Rodriguez allows for extremely long internal voice-over monologues from his heroes to give them appropriate humanity along with visual grit. Now in comic books like the one from which this movie was derived, the dialogue is usually about fifty percent thought bubbles to allow for characterization from otherwise un-personalized archetypes. Rodriguez does what the X-Men and Batman movies avoided doing by placing that huge amount of internal speech in the movie as voice-overs. He makes the script of this movie sound like the reading of an actual comic book, not just a script based on characters and ideas from a comic book. This movie is not based on a comic book but is actually a faithful, life-action representation of a comic book and that in itself should garner Rodriguez credit as a courageous filmmaker because it is an extremely daring thing to attempt. It is not unsuccessful, but there are some problems with such a script. For one, it will turn off fans of traditional movie scripts who have never enjoyed comic books. Furthermore, the voice-overs are occasionally awkwardly worded and provide little person to person acting that modern audiences expect. True, Clive Owen, Bruce Willis, and Mickey Rourke are all in this movie, but don't expect a scene of intense person acting between an enraged Owen and a quiescent Willis. This movie is not about the development of these characters, they are merely the vessels allowing for the creation of a twisted and corrupt Orwellian otherworld, a physical canvas for Rodriguez to play with style upon.<br/><br/>While there were many inventive things bout this movie, there were some aspects that got extremely tired by the end of the movie. When someone is shot 100 times in the chest, do not assume they are dead. I would say that almost every character in this movie appears dead but then is magically resurrected by either the powers of fortune or just simply super-human vitality. I mean, it gets ridiculous when Benecio Del Toro's Jackie Boy continues speaking for about thirty minutes of the movie after he has been brutally beheaded and turned into a pez dispenser of vital fluids. It must be something in the water because every character in Sin City can seemingly jump off of incredibly tall buildings and land on cement without any pain. It is humorous that Willis' character Hartigan checks to see if Junior is dead after being shot directly in the neck. Its only funny because we know that he is not dead even though Willis' finds no pulse. His later appearance is practically expected by that point, even though its supposed to be surprising.<br/><br/>The plots are not very interesting. There are twists and more twists, but the gist of the plot is always the brutal execution of one person or the other. By the time all three sub-stories end, supposed heroes Willis, Rourke, and Owen have killed at least 100 people combined. Rodriguez blends the three stories nicely with coincidences and time and characters linking the stories into a web of chaos. By the end of the movie, you feel like you have been on a whirlwind of violence and scantily clad women. It is a perfect movie for guys in their twenties who lie comics, but I can safely say that outside of that demographic few would stomach this film or at the very least venture to call it an enjoyable experience. For the most part, the movie is trivial and needlessly violent, but always interesting and always (because of Rodriguez's one of a kind style) fun to look at, so I would certainly suggest it for the curious moviegoer. Its probably safer to watch Finding Neverland, but if your in the mood for something wild and out of the ordinary, ""Sin City"" is guaranteed to hit the spot."

","This is a wonderful adaption of the comic book series Sin City. You definitely don't have to have ever read the comic book series to enjoy, heck , you don't even need to know what comics are like. It helps but regardless this is an imaginative, thrill ride that leaves you feeling a little dirty inside. It is a dark guilty pleasure to chuckle at some of the groosome characters and scenes that only a comic book could produce. I loved it for its direct transfer of dynamic detail in the form of simple art work and color as found in the comic. I enjoyed the balance of realism and fiction along with the balance of the occasional bright red lipstick."

","Walking into the theater to see Sin City, you likely fall into one of two camps: (a) those who think (nay, know) the movie will be one of the most spectacular films since Kill Bill Vol. 2; or (b) those who think it will likely be a waste of hard-earned green. Place this reviewer firmly in the former band of movie-goers.<br/><br/>Director Robert Rodriguez and co-director Frank Miller, creator and author of the original graphic novels, clearly show their love for the original works. Frame by frame, one could flip through these novels and find the corresponding frame in the film. While Spider-Man, Hulk, and Daredevil were comic book adaptations, Sin City is the original comic amplified and given a shot of Red Bull and Absinthe.<br/><br/>Those who have doubts about the completely digital nature of the film should not fret. Sin City is almost universally convincing as a living, bustling place that a normal human being wouldn't want to be caught dead in. There are only a handful of occasions that one can notice that a green screen was used. But seriously, who cares? When the action is on, it moves at one hundred miles an hour. This movie is not for the faint of heart (or stomach). It's gritty, hard-boiled, and everything a good noir flick should be. And when the characters trade barbs with one another or narrate through their thoroughly FUBAR situation, we get the feeling that what we are witnessing is cinematography and script-writing at its finest (indeed, the vast majority of the lines are lifted straight from the comics).<br/><br/>The acting here is top-notch, but there are a few actors that outshine the others: specifically, Mickey Rourke as Marv, Bruce Willis as Hartigan and Clive Owen as Dwight. All three of these actors are thoroughly convincing in their respective roles. We feel their anger, their outrage, their despondency. They get shot, punched, bitten, and generally pummeled but still get back up to fight a few more rounds. And we can't help but cheer them on. The three graphic novels used to make up this movie take the viewer on a roller coaster of profanity, violence and (admittedly gratuitous) nudity.<br/><br/>Sin City is a movie for film buffs, comic book geeks, and violence-obsessed Tarantino fans alike. Watch it, absorb it, and toss it over in your mind, just as you might if you were to pore over the graphic novel."

","This movie was great!! I recommend it to anyone who is in a mood for a little bit of humor and some fighting sequences!! All the actors and actresses were great!! It was a little bit long but all together it kept me entertained. Robert Rodrigues' best film yet, he surprised me with all of the great special effects and the lighting of the film was awesome!! One of my favorite parts of the movie was in the the second story, when Miho kicks the ass of all the men in the car!! The way she stabbed all of them; so quick!! I loved it because there was women kicking ass and we need more of that!! More women independence!!! A funny thing about the movie is that you don't know when it will end, or when one of the characters will die. Like when Marv was in the electric chair, he said ""is that the best you got"" and they had to put more power to kill him that was the great thing about the movie!! I thought Jessica Alba was in it more though, she was in it at the end mainly but still she delivered a good performance. I am so glad that a Mexican directed this movie we need more hispanics in Hollywood, I am also glad that he put a lot of good hispanic actors on screen!!"

","this film shows the work of a skilled director, who has vision, technique, and discipline, abandoning convention and letting everything, (and i mean everything) hang out there. from the behind the scenes drama (relinquishing his dga card) to the on screen shock, he tells a sublime story about good and evil, about justice and corruption, about heaven and hell, and about the people that populate those regions, without bowing to the powers that be. i will have to soak this film in and see it a couple of more times to place it in a catechism order, but right now, moments after my first screening, ""sin city"" is about as ""right"" a movie as i have seen."

I have been thinking about it all day, especially Mickey Rourke and Benecio del Toro. It is a wonderfully constructed and entertaining movie, and I can tell it was made with great care and affection. The rich black and white mingled with the highlights of color was beautiful to look at. There were many scenes I could tell were lifted right off the pages of Miller's books.

","Greetings again from the darkness. Very loyal adaptation of the graphic novels of Frank Miller, who also receives directing credit and is seen in the movie as a priest. The driving force behind the movie is the always fascinating Robert Rodriguez (""Once Upon a Time In Mexico""). Legend has it that the opening scene with Josh Hartnett and Marley Shelton was filmed by Rodriguez and delivered as a gift to Miller in an effort to gain the writer's approval to make this film. What we see here is the total Rodriguez vision.<br/><br/>The incredibly deep cast jumps in with both feet and we do get the real feel of the graphic novels (don't call them comic books!). Rodriguez uses color sparingly to prevent the ad nauseum view of blood and to capitalize on the always night, always rainy scenes. The splashes of color are very dramatic and are usually red (blood, sheets, cars) with a few exceptions, such as the crystal blue eyes of Alexis Bledel (""Tuck Everlasting"" ""Gilmore Girls"").<br/><br/>A few of the many characters really stand out. Mickey Rourke, Benecio del Toro and Brittany Murphy all nail their characters and it is always a pleasure to watch Michael Madsen pull off another twisted character. The weaker links are Jessica Alba (yeah, I know, who cares if she can't act) and Rosario Dawson. Bruce Willis and Powers Boothe are fine in their roles, but the most delightful character is Miho played by stoic Chanel model Devon Aoki (daughter of Benihana founder Rocky Aoki). Not sure how much Elijah Wood got paid, but it had to be the easiest money he ever made. My biggest complaint with the film is the miscasting of Clive Owen as Dwight.<br/><br/>Overall, Rodriguez delivers another signature, unique film with great characters, music and cars. He has such a visual style that it is always an education to watch his films. Doesn't hurt to have his best bud, QT, listed a guest director!"

","I had never read Frank Miller's short stories, nor anything else pertaining to Sin City, so I went into the theater tonight with a clear mind. And I think it helped. I loved it because it was all so new to me and if were familiar with his works, then I would have critiqued and pointed out every meticulous detail that differed from the comics. This really felt like an honest-to-God comic book coming to life what with the narration and black and white(save for a few colors) settings. This film featured a huge ensemble cast and each one brought something different to the table. My favorite performance was Mickey Rourke as Marv and I had no idea that was him underneath the make-up. Jessica Alba,Bruce Willis,Michael Madsen,Elijah Wood,Benicio Del Toro,Rosario Dawson(so damn hot!) all fit in nicely. I will not spoil anything because there is too much to cover but the basic premise is Marv looking for the killer of a prostitute named Goldie that had befriended him. There is a lot of violence in this film, but nothing over the top that would be considered controversial. 3 separate stories intertwine to make up an interesting and fresh movie. Destined to become a cult classic and a sequel would be hard-pressed not to be made."
"dazman85","9","0","5","2 April 2005"," Sin City disgraces the name of film noir.
","Sin City is the worst movie I have seen in a long time. Robert Rodriguez put up Frank Miller's graphic novels almost to the point. His classic comics have been portrayed in a horrible adaptation of black and white where the blood goes back and forth between pigeon poop and red goo. Too be fair you must know Tarantino is my favorite director, but this is not even worthy of his name. It is played and in three different stories that do not come together. Pulp Fiction, which also was Tarantino, was great in how at the end everything made sense, something this movie did not. Most of the characters were not even fully described, which probably means they're hoping to pump out another one of these. The most you could ever hope to get out of this movie is a few laughs."

I have to say that Marv is by far, the baddest mother i have ever seen portrayed on screen. the editing is marvelous and the visual effects are stunning. the voice over sound is semi-entertaining, however it fits the movie very well. the movie is very humorous and at times cheesy, but i believe that these elements add to the overall appeal of such a movie, based on comics after all. anyone who watches this movie should go into it pretending to read a comic, and you'll do fine. finally, the colour scheme is perfect, kudos to whoever's idea that was. a perfect 10."
"harmonium_303","8","0","1","2 April 2005"," A little too long, and not as thrilling and excellent as everyone says, but still pretty darn good
","(MINOR SPOILERS) My first experience with Sin City was actually the sexy poster portraying Jessica Alba as Nancy, the exotic dancer. I saw the poster on sale at a horror convention, and thought ""hmm that's a movie I'll probably want to see"". Then when I saw commercials for it, it looked really good. I was hearing nothing but good things about the movie, which made me all the more excited. But as usual, all they hype behind this movie made my expectations soar, and the movie wasn't as mind-blowing as expected. It was still pretty good and certainly something different, but I was expecting it to be better.<br/><br/>Now I'm pretty sure that I am getting bashed by the reader of this comment, but let me just say that I gave this film a 7.5 out of 10, which I rounded up to an 8. The major complaint I have with the movie is that it was a bit too long; maybe an hour and 40 minutes would have been better, rather than 2 hours and 6 minutes. Some of the scenes were a little boring, but were always followed up with a cool action scene. Other than the longevity, it was a pretty good movie, and certainly original.<br/><br/>Sin City is like a collection of different stories, depicting certain situations of the characters. Bruce Willis is a detective who saves 11 year old Nancy Callahan from an evil child molester, played by Nick Stahl. Then the story is shifted to Marv (played to perfection by Mickey Rourke), a man with a slightly deformed face who falls in love with a hooker, only for her to be murdered while they are passed out drunk. He seeks brutal revenge on the people who murdered the only person who ever really cared about him. Next we move on to Clive Owen's character Dwight, who is now the boyfriend of bar wench Brittany Murphy. Her ex boyfriend appears to be an abusive jerk, so Dwight and his gang of hookers hunt him and his little crew down and also get their gory revenge. We then go back to Willis's character, who is finally released out of jail and fearing that now 19 year old Nancy is in danger. He finds out that she is now an exotic dancer, and is in love with him since he saved her life all those years ago. They are chased down by Nick Stahl's character, who has turned into a hideous yellow monstrosity, thanks to some bad medicine he had to take.<br/><br/>Overall this was a pretty good movie. All the acting was great, especially Mickey Rourke's character. Elijah Wood's Kevin character never speaks, and is just downright creepy. Jessica Alba is certainly sexy as exotic flashdancer (if you will) Nancy Callahan, and Brittany Murphy was actually pretty good herself. The movie is loaded with violence, but since the majority of the film is black and white, the blood is bright white and is not really that gross. There really isn't as much nudity as everyone is saying, just a few short topless scenes and that's about it. This was definitely a good comic book movie, and reminded me of Kill Bill in a way. I recommend this movie, but not if you have a weak stomach."

","I have read all of Frank Millers Sin City books, several times each. I went in and was very critical about this movie. Yes I would have loved to see the scene where Hartigan fantasizes that he has the strenght of Hercules, but other that than the move was perfect. Marv moved the way you figured he would in the book. Dwight was as calm and cool as you hope he would be, and Hartigan as tortured. Yes I swear I could even smell the Yellow Bastard! Perfect! I especially loved watching the first chapter of the Hard Goodbye on screen. Marv busts through the door and makes a run for it, it was like watching the pages come to life. I never would have imagined Mickey Rourke for this role, and I was afraid he would look cheesy...NO WAY, he is right on. He was Marv and will always be Marv for me. Clive Owen was a great Dwight too.

","saw it last night. Pretty cool. most of it was pretty good. the Clive Owen/Rosario Dawson/Brittany Murphy vignette is pretty weak however as none of those three could act their way out of a wet paper bag. Not even Benicio Del Toro could save this one. The other ""star"" in that particular vignette is Michael Clarke Duncan who also cant act. But the rest was pretty cool. Tons of hot chicks and at times, really over the top especially the violence. i loved it. I was trying to figure out which part Tarantino directed. if it was the Clive Owen part, then thats weak, because we already met ""Miho"" the first time when she was called ""Gogo"" in Kill Bill vol.1 (i know its not the same actress, but they are essentially the same character, with Gogo being the better, more original one). so I'm hoping it was one of the other two that directed that part. I also think its funny how the washed up past his prime old man would-be hero type protagonist seems to proliferate Frank Millers work. The Dark Knight Returned again and again in this movie. The whole thing plays out a lot like ""Pulp Fiction"" in the way the characters and story lines interweave. Also in the half assed attempt at ""irreverant"" casting. No surprise there I'm sure. The biggest difference in the cast of ""Sin City"" and the cast of ""Pulp Fiction"" is that at least in Pulp Fiction, everyone was a good actor. This is NOT the case with Sin City, as it seems for every quality actor cast, there was a crappy worthless ""actor"" cast. A little too much of Hollywood trying to pass off ""actors"" who are hot and in right now, instead of actors who can act. Just like the bathroom, you can spray as much deodorizer as you want, and it still smells like sh1t and roses.In addition, of all the comic book (fuckk calling them ""graphic novels"") silver screen adaptations that Hollywood is pumping out right now this one is the most authentic to the comic of all of them. For example i enjoyed both X-men movies, however i always feel like they are the Hollywood movie adaptation of a comic book, Sin City feels like the actual comic book is on the screen. very authentic feeling which is a real coup for director Roberto Rodriguez. I guess he had some kind of falling out with the Directors Guild of America over sharing the directors credit with Frank Miller. so i guess preserving the integrity of the book was paramount to senor rodriguez. so i give Sin City like a 6 out of 10."

","Having never read the graphic novels, I went into Sin City only seeing the trailers and some behind-the-scenes extras on a DVD at Best Buy. The cinematography is sharp, crisp and stands out from the use of black and white film (with hints of color at appropriate times.) If anything, the way the flashes of color pull your eyes across the screen really makes you feel you are being coerced into the stories. Black and white seems to befit a Sin City world full of grays. The film also utilizes narration in ways that I have yet to see on screen where even the narrator shifts from one character to another in one sequence. The acting was strong for this film although I do think that Michael Madsen could have sounded less stiff (as if he were reading a teleprompter.) Major kudos for Mickey Rourke's portrayal of Marv. Beautiful women (Alba, Gugino, Rosario, King, Murphey and many more) abound in the film with tons of imperfect men. This is a genre-busting film that firmly portrays the underbelly of civilized man. Not a film for the dainty, as this could definitely be filed as a horror film (the dead bodies become difficult to count) with sharp wit, well-directed action sequences and touching moments. For the first time in my life, I'm upset that I didn't go right back in to see the movie again."
"mbianch1","Null","0","1","2 April 2005"," Excellent film
","I saw Sin City the other night and I was simply blown away. From the opening and closing scenes, I loved every minute. I had previously read the graphic novels on which the film was based, so I knew the story lines and the characters. Yet despite this, I was still amazed at how well done everything was. I think many people in the theater were disappointed, but I really couldn't understand why. People certainly thought it was bloodier than they expected, but I knew that the graphic novels created by Frank Miller were full of gore and I was thus prepared for what I saw on screen. The film-noir style of the movie worked really well with the black and white cinematography and the color coding of certain objects drew the eye to every detail. This film was true to the graphic novel in almost every aspect, save for a few changes which were both necessary and beneficial in the end. Even the dialogue spoken by the characters, though at times wooden, was taken directly from the graphic novels. As I said, the dialogue was at points ""cheesy,"" but this film is a film-noir and I felt the dialogue was actually better than what I have heard from the old 1930-1950s gangster films, where lines like ""I'll get him good"" are quite common. Keep in mind that if you hear a few lines that make you cringe, more than likely they are done like that ON PURPOSE. Sin City was a beautiful film, it has everything for everybody. The cinematography will satisfy people who think they know everything about the aesthetics of film-making, the story runs smoothly throughout (some people may get confused with so many characters and plots, but just try and pay attention) and the action is practically non-stop throughout, for those who go to see films to watch things ""blow up."" However, this movie is not for the squeamish. It is filled with blood and gore and children should not even be let into the theaters showing this film. In conclusion, I thought Sin City was great. Though looking at things realistically, I think people are either going to love it or hate it. People who have read the graphic novels will love it, those who haven't (with some exceptions) will probably scratch their heads and wonder what the big deal is."

","I've never read a Frank Miller graphic novel, but I was intrigued by the seemingly endless promotions for this film on SpikeTV. After catching a matinÃ©e today, I have to say that this is one of those very rare films that lives up to the hype. Though there were moments when I found the dialog a bit cheesy, the stories, the characters and the amazing cinematography were more than enough to keep me interested. I made a point of not doing any pre-viewing net research, so I was blown away by Mickey Rourke as Marv. I don't even like Mickey R. but I thought he was fantastic in this film. If you're looking to disassociate from reality for a while and you want a roller coaster of a ride, get thee to the nearest showing of Sin City."
"grendelkhan","Null","0","2","2 April 2005"," More hard boiled than a 90 minute egg!
","Frank Miller's Sin City series of graphic novels are stark tales of hard boiled men, tough dames, nasty villains, corrupt cops, and steely-eyed killers. It was inspired by the works of Jim Thompson, James M. Cain, Mickey Spillane, Dashiell Hammett, and Raymond Chandler; film noir, and the works of Bernard Kriegsten. They are told in black and white, with occasional splashes of color, in an almost impressionistic style. Miller made a name for himself working on costumed heroes, like Daredevil and Batman, instilling them with his love of crime fiction. When he created his own stories, he left the costumes behind and went full-tilt noir.<br/><br/>Sin City, the movie, perfectly captures the look and tone of Miller's stories, with identical staging and the use of stark contrast in lighting. There are flashes of color, which have greater impact after the noirish scenery. The violence is over the top, in keeping with the comic origins. The characters look the part and the world exists in its own time and place.<br/><br/>The dialogue is pure Miller and sounds like it could have been spoken by Bogart or Cagney. That does present a slight problem, after years of more realistic dialogue in crime dramas. However, the actors deliver it with conviction, although it is a bit shaky in the opening scenes. It gets better as the film progresses. Much of it is delivered as monologue voice-over, in keeping with the traditions.<br/><br/>Mickey Rourke and Bruce Willis are the stand-outs, both able to convincing deliver the dialogue and carry the character. They dominate their scenes, although they have the best material to work from. Clive Owen and Benicio Del Toro are good, but their segment is a bit weaker. The various actresses perform their parts well, but the women of Sin City are a bit lacking in depth. There are no Barbara Stanwycks here.<br/><br/>Robert Rodriguez has captured the look and feel of the source well. The use of digital imagery captures the noir look, without the need for complex sets and lighting. However, it does tend to give everything an artificial aura. Real noir presented a harsh, fantastic world, but it always had substance. Despite advances in technology, the human eye still detects the artifice of CGI.<br/><br/>Overall, the film is quite entertaining, although extremely violent. This is not a date movie (unless your idea of romance is Natural Born Killers). It is modern noir, with the cynicism, corruption, depravity and vice. It's also a hell of a ride! The film is being compared to Pulp Fiction, but they are two different entities. Tarrantino's was a slicked-up homage to pulp storytelling; this is pure pulp. So, grab your favorite coat, a pack of smokes, a blue-steeled automatic, and enter the chiaroscuro world of Sin City."

","I'll admit right now, I've never read the graphic novel of which this film is based and ,being a fan of mystery and noir, am surprised I didn't hear of this series sooner up until the trailers. But a little digging got me caught up and interested in what this movie had to offer (that and the fact that Texas own, Robert Rodriguez, was directing the film :)).<br/><br/>Premise: Based of three tales of the series (That Yellow Bastard, Hard Goodbye, and Big Fat Kill) Sin City follows the ""heroes"" of their stories as they deal with their situations in the famed city of hard (VERY hard) knocks.<br/><br/>The first act, Hard Goodbye, is my personal favorite of the three. The main character is just so likable and the surprises (saving that you've never read the comics) really come fast. It has a bittersweet ending but around this point, you'll be glad to know that this poor sap went out happy.<br/><br/>Second act, Big Fat Kill, will probably be the most enjoyed of the audience. There's a lot more energy and action here plus the deadpan narration of this story's hero really is worth a chuckle.<br/><br/>Lastly is the final act, That Yellow Bastard, which really is more of a traditional noir tale then the first two and bit of a hard act to follow. However the grip of this hero situation pulls you in and, like Hard Goodbye, it has a very bittersweet end. Still a very well done story.<br/><br/>I'll admit that some of the effects, quick cuts and acting can be a little silly (most of it was done in green screen after all) but the style and beauty of the work more then make up for it, never mind the fact that its done in b&w (if anything it enhances the mood of the stories plus those white on black silhouettes KICK ASS!) Not to mention the A-list actors here and no, for all you haters out there, it more then just attracting an audience. They all really seemed to really get into their roles and bring out the characters. Seriously, for once I was thinking about the characters rather then the actors who WERE the characters. This is a bunch who took the movie's source seriously. Nice and my hats off to them for their hard work.<br/><br/>Definitely one of the best movies of 2005. I wouldn't know if its as good as its source and quite frankly I don't care, it came out good to me anyway. Still if your a fan of the series, check it out. If not, give it a watch anyway though be warned this is a EXTREMELY graphic movie. So if you don't have a stomach for it, I wouldn't bother. And haters if you can look beyond the blood, gore, action, etc...You might just enjoy it.<br/><br/>Overall, a excellent way to kill two hours and enjoy yourself. Check it out!"
"mrfancypants_","10","0","5","2 April 2005"," A super-cool film that is perhaps easy to forget...
","Sin City is a direct interpretation of Frank Miller's graphic novels of the same name. It shows. Everything is done in a comic-book like fashion. The violence is very much stylized and the characters posses superhuman strength and ability. This is not necessarily a bad thing. The overall style of the film is something I have never seen in films before. The environments pull you into the twisted world that is 'Sin City'. And this city is dark...very dark. One of the main issues surrounding this movie is its adult content. I personally don't think that the excessive violence was offensive because it is shown in such an over-the-top way that it is often comical. There is a huge difference between comic-book violence and real-life violence. For example, in Sin City a main character is able to take ten bullets to the chest and keep on ticking. One of my favorite things about this movie is that it made me laugh when people were dying the most horrible of deaths (which is one of the reasons I think people who have a problem with the content will not enjoy this film at all). However I did have one problem with the violence. By the end of the film, so many characters had died that the important deaths of main characters had no effect on me whatsoever. Some of the dialogue was also so over-the-top that I found myself laughing when I shouldn't have. Specifically Michael Madsen (who I love), sounded like he was reading his lines directly from the pages of the comic-book. I would have liked to see some straying from the exact duplication of Frank Miller's works. It was also clear that each shot in the film was based on a frame from the comic. This means that the camera hardly moved (beautiful camera movement is what Robert Rodriguez does best in my opinion), and when it did move I was amazed at how nice that shot looked.<br/><br/>Overall I have to say that Sin City is a cool movie that is definitely worth seeing (maybe not remembering) if you don't have a problem with the content."

","I love the comic books, so I loved this movie. I have never been so excited to see the film adaptation of a comic book- It was great. I don't care anything for Robert Rodriguez, but I gotta give him a huge thumbs up. This movie is word for word and action for action. He did not stray, he remained true, and gave the fans what they want. I think this is one of the best comic book movies ever, besides Tim Burton's Batman. All the actors did a good job and even though I don't consider many of them great actors, they portrayed the parts and were very believable. The dialogue and actions were outlandish and extreme, but that is Sin City. It is two hours of bliss in my opinion, and I wish Mickey Rourke would win something for his portrayal of Marv- Superb! Elijah Wood was a perfect Kevin as well. I am a young female, and the violence did not bother me. Most are saying this movie is for guys, but it isn't. It is for fans, and I say the more decapitations the better!"

If you're a fan of Rodriguez &/or Tarantino, this is what it is all about...THIS IS THE REAL SH*T!!! The Male 'Heroes' are gritty, dirty and violent. The Ladies are lovely & lethal.

","Now, I've came out of movies with a high that clouded my judgment and caused me to believe I had just seen the most badass movie of all-time (The Matrix Reloaded being the most recent culprit). But I can say with all the assurance in the world that Sin City is one of the most innovative movies of all-time, and was captivating from the first frame until the last one. It's easy to pigeonhole this as Pulp Fiction for comic freaks, but that's unfair: Sin City stands on its own as a modern cinematic masterpiece of comic-noir that will be unrivaled for years to come. Coming from a huge Robert Rodriguez fan, this is easily his best movie, and probably will remain his best. If Rodriguez can do any better than this, I'd make sweet love to him."

Keep in mind that all of it (excluding the beginning with Bruce) is happening at the same time. Maybe it will help in the understanding. The best part of the movie, since it was in black and white, was the great usage of spot colors. It added a lot. The colors and lighting and directing angles were awesome!!

"fogeyfan","10","0","6","2 April 2005"," This Decade's ""Pulp Fiction""
","""Sin City"" rocks! It's the ""Pulp Fiction"" of this decade, yet still cinematicly groundbreaking. Robert Rodriquez has emerged as the greatest director of his generation. I truly believe that within a few more years his name will be right up there with Hitchcock and Spielberg.<br/><br/>Another similarity to ""Pulp Fiction"" is that this film may do for Mickey Rourke's career what PF did for John Travolta's. Rourke is terrific behind facial prosthetics that give him a ""graphic novel"" (the current politically correct term for ""comic book"") profile with a nose that remains to its tip in a perfect straight line with the forehead. Benicio Del Toro, while appearing less of a physical caricature than Rourke's character ""Marv"", is even more unrecognizable under his makeup. Bruce Willis perfectly inhabits his role as a tough but sensitive cop like he has done countless times before. Clive Owen shines in his heroic role as well. <br/><br/>And as for the ladies... what can I say, I'm now in love with Carla Gugino! Marv gets a view of her nearly naked backside as she leans over a sink - he can't stop staring (and neither could I). Not to mention what we see of her other side - whoa! Jessica Alba, Rosario Dawson, Brittany Murphy, et al - all dressed to accentuate their curves. Got to admit that this film got my loins to tingling several times.<br/><br/>Be warned, there's lots of stylish violence in the ""Kill Bill"" vein. If that and some nudity and sexual situations don't bother you, by all means, GO SEE ""SIN CITY""!!!"
"DjangoLeone","9","0","2","2 April 2005"," SIN CITY *minor spoilers*
","I was so excited for this movie for weeks and last night I finally saw it and, I'm happy to say, it did not disappoint. Being a big Robert Rodriguez fan as well as a fan of comics, I already had the fan boy thing going but I think even non-fans will find something they like. Firstly, the look of the film is amazing and will get most of the press. It really does look like Frank Miller's drawings come to life, even down to the stylized white (or in some cases yellow) blood. The flashes of color add much to the stark black and gray. But what I was most impressed with was how well the stories unraveled. Each of the leads held their own, though Marv (played masterfully by Mickey Rourke)is the heart of the film. His story has the highest body count but Marv is still the most sympathetic character of the bunch. The action is phenomenal and as graphic as the novel. This film is dripping with noir and despite the entirely computer generated environment, it was easy to forget Sin City isn't a real place. I found myself so immersed in the City that afterwards I unconsciously began to narrate the walk to the car and wishing corrupt cops would pull up and attack. This is one of the most innovative and downright awesome films I've seen in recent years. Rodriguez and Miller's film accomplishes much cinematic ally without sacrificing any of the graphic novel's integrity. The scene Quentin Tarantino directs (I'll leave it to you to pick it out) fits perfectly within the film. Kudos to all involved. 9.8/10 (no movie gets a 10)"
"otis_27","9","0","3","2 April 2005"," unique and amazing
","This is the first movie I've seen in years that is so unique that it really has no basis for comparison. It has no resemblance to other comic book movies and projects the feel and imagery of a comic better than anything I've ever seen (including many comics). I enjoyed everything about this movie from the dialogue and scenery to the action and gore. It was all handled in a very artistic and creative manner that really sets it apart from any other film to date. There were some weaker points in the film but very few, and the overall positives vastly outweigh the negatives. It is also a very violent movie with no lack of death and dismemberment so if you can't handle that kind of thing then it may not be for you. This movie also has so many recognizable faces throughout the whole movie that it's really a credit to the actors and the directors that it doesn't become a distraction. Every character fits and no one seems out of place. Mickey Rourke in particular was absolutely perfect. This was a wonderful movie."

Compare it to Kill Bill and Pulp Fiction. This raw movie turned out to be unbelievable. The cast was superb, the action was intense, and the story line was flat out sweet. Marv kicked ass, and Bruce Willis did a perfect job. So suck it up, pay the ticket, and have some fun with this movie.

","I saw ""Sin City"" last night and was amazed at how much I really enjoyed it. I am not a comic book lover and never have been, I have nothing against them, I just always wrote them off as a guy thing. After seeing this movie though, I find myself wanting to go to the book store and checking out some of the other graphic novels out there. I thought Mickey Rourke did a fantastic job. He hasn't exactly been on the top of the A-list in the last several years, but I think this movie will put him higher up on the Hollywood food chain. The movie was over-the-top to say the least. It has a ridiculous quality to it that is easily overlooked as long as the viewer keeps in mind that it is based on a comic book. My only criticism of the film is Alexis Bledel. I just don't think she was right for the role of ""Becky"". I credit my dislike of her in this movie, however, to the fact that I am an avid Gilmore Girls watcher so it was hard for me to separate her from that character and visualize her as a hooker. Visually I was stunned at the way the film was shot. At different points during the movie I could actually see these characters on the page of a comic book. Without a doubt I think this is one of the best movies I've seen so far this year. People complained about the violence and the moral deficiency portrayed on screen without any real inspirational message at the end. Frank Miller created a world where even being good can mean having to be bad and I loved that about it. I go to the movies for escapism. I can't say I watch movies to learn anything or to be taught a moral lesson, I watch them to entertained without any regard to subject matter. Sex and violence in a movie doesn't bother me as long as at the end I felt like I had taken a trip somewhere else while never leaving the theater seat and ""Sin City"" did that for me."

","This film is visually stunning, and although I've only glanced once at the graphic novels from which it is inspired, the parallels in appearance and action are incredible. The characters seem to have stepped right off the page. The gory scenes hold nothing back, but still find a way to be beautiful. It is like paint is being sloshed around on a canvas, not blood all over victims. If you are not into these type of violent, action films, I would still recommend seeing it in the theater solely for visual purposes. The only other thing I would like to say is that after critiquing beautifully made, ingenious films, made solely from the film itself and raw materials, it is hard for me to feel like the filmmakers didn't cheat with this one by using state-of-the-art equipment, an unbelievable budget, and numerous experts to perfect every detail. However, it would be a shame to never see the true possibilities of today's film-making technology, and although there is something to be said for a filmmaker who makes a stunning film by himself with the money in his/her pocket, this movie is quite frankly, cool as hell."

Sin City is a ride, a dark journey into the depths of a world first seen in Miller's classic comics.<br/><br/>The film is so faithful to the comics that it feels like a comic book come to life. The characters appearances are so similar to the comic book images that at times it is difficult to tell the difference. But as great as Miller's understanding of comic books and the need for comic movies to be faithful to them is, Rodriguez' understanding of movies rivals it.

","Ever since I saw the trailer I've been waiting to see this movie. Just the look of it caught my eye, and it has addicted me ever since. After seeing the movie, I can say that Sin City definitely did not let me down. I read the graphic novels awhile back, but after seeing the trailers I had to go revisit them to get ready for the movie. Even in the first scene of the movie, you can tell that a movie has finally retained the artistry of a graphic novel in its conversion to cinema. Finally, the spirit of a comic book has been kept alive in the transition. Finally, a movie has been made that is incredible faithful to the material it is based off of. Finally, a movie has been made of which you have a hard time saying, ""The book was better."" Well, to clear things up, this movie is definitely not for the faint of heart. It is chock full of violence, has a bit of nudity (though not really sexual), and is full of those themes we love to hate such as pedophilia, prostitution, torture, etc. Yet, the movie doesn't really hold any of things seriously. It's hard to explain. In some way, they were able to make this movie full of glorified violence (though much of it is ""comic-booky"" meaning lots of fake blood spurts, think Kill Bill Vol. 1) and immoral EVERYTHING and do it in a properly tongue in cheek manner. If you let yourself laugh, instead of sitting there shaking your head at how the world is going to hell because of movies like this, you will enjoy yourself.<br/><br/>Finally, the movie is good at telling the story. You would think that the plot would get lost in all the bloodbath, but it doesn't. Of course, the plot isn't incredibly deep full of twists and turns, but it gets the job done in that properly retro-noir flavor. And for once the big name actors are there for a reason. They can almost make you take seriously the purposefully cheesy dialogue that hearkens back to old Film Noir movies. And even though I knew what was going to happen, they kept me glued every minute.<br/><br/>If you are looking for a visually stunning and incredibly entertaining action flick, go see Sin City. But leave your morals at the door and not take everything so seriously, and you'll be in for a hell of a ride.<br/><br/>9.5/10"

There is plenty of comedy but never tips over into being corny. And you have to love all the hot chicks and plentiful ass shots. Sin City is visual perfect!!

Well, Rob and Frank did, and I absolutely loved the movie. A little over the top, a little too much violence, and sometimes the narration really wasn't needed. As a fan of the comics, I think that Rob and Frank surpassed the comics and made a very good movie that should rank up there with the best, if not for the feel of the entire movie.

"firehawkk05@hotmail.com","9","0","3","2 April 2005"," For Comic Book and Action Fans, a Must-See
","What an incredible, unique, intense, and stylish film.<br/><br/>Based on Frank Millers original comic book, Sin City, this movie is a collection of three vignettes all taking place within the same time-span and in the same location in Sin City, where it is perpetually raining and overflowing with corruption, prostitution, and murder. Each of these vignettes are relatively independent of each other, yet this is a wise choice. This movie moves with incredible speed, much like a comic book would, jumping from scene to scene. At this rate, having three stories is appropriate and keeps it interesting.<br/><br/>In the movie, we follow the conquests of Marv out for revenge for his one true love, Hardigan trying to play the good cop in a bad city, and Dwight as he meddles in the affairs of prostitutes.<br/><br/>As can be told by the previews, the movie is done completely in black and white, except for a few artistic choices for color. Sometimes blood is red, certain eyes are blue or green, and the Yellow Bastard is yellow in complete. This follows the style of the comic book, but is a wise and stylistic decision - the grays make the city even more dim, with the few hints of color act as a wonderful contrast. Furthermore, the movie makes a lot of daring shots that are almost frame-for-frame like you would see in a comic book, also adding to the atmosphere. Overall, Sin City is an artistic masterpiece and original in it's cinematography choices.<br/><br/>What I loved most about this movie were the characters and the acting. Each of the characters had something unique and intriguing to give to the screen...a past, a trait, or merely their unique appearance. You only get a few spare minutes with many of the bit players, but you find yourself wanting to know more about each of them, villains included, so you find yourself intrigued for the entirety of the movie. Furthermore, the casting was right on target. Though star-studded, which can be critical death for many box office hits, each person was placed in the right character, and they pull it off expertly.<br/><br/>I am particularly intrigued by Elijah Wood's character and the fact that he was chosen for it; watch and see for yourselves what I mean.<br/><br/>The directing and writing of this movie are excellent. Indeed, if you are a fan of the Sin City comics, you will be pleased by the accuracy of this movie...certain scenes are frame-for-frame and word-for-word from the original comic book. The story lines plots keep you guessing and on the edge of your seat for the movie's entirety. The dialogue is smart and edgy, and the inner plots will have you wanting more by the end.<br/><br/>Indeed, Sin City does an amazing job at creating an atmosphere and a world that will make you feel transported into it's grim world. You leave the theater half expecting/half wanting for the lobby and streets to be black and white.<br/><br/>As a disclaimer, the movie is very violent and has quite a lot of nakedness. After all, a great number of the characters are prostitutes, and Quentin Tarantino guest-directed, which might say something about the violence level. (Think Kill Bill.) But, that said, if you can handle the R rating and a little bit of blood, Sin City is Must See."
"quanticomvp","9","0","3","2 April 2005"," Excellent in Almost Every Way
","This movie is superb all the way across the board. The performances were spot-on and even occasionally over the top, especially with the characters of Clive Owen and Bruce Willis. But, seeing as how the movie is based on a graphic novel, the performances are appropriate. The movie is a 130 minute thrill ride, shocking the viewers (who haven't read the graphic novels) roughly every 10 minutes, if not more frequently than that. My only beef is with the dialogue. Rodriguez claims that he didn't even write a script, that he just transcribed what was in Miller's graphic novels. As such, the dialogue, not always, but occasionally, can be a little cheesy or melodramatic; sometimes, graphic novel dialogue doesn't always translate well onto the big screen. Other than this, the movie is spotless."

","I must say this was one of the most enjoyable movies I have seen since Pulp Fiction. The cast is amazing, a cool mix of old school Hollywood giants and fresh talented faces. What I must comment on is that how happy I was to see Mickey Rourke back on a major role like this. He is simply one of the greats of the American cinema, I put him right next to Brando, Di Nero, and the others. The magic he creates is amazing. In this maximum film he had put out an Oscar worthy performance. On the other hand to watch Bruce Willis is like watching Al Pacino, he delivers big and makes it worth it. The perfect mix of the other characters, beautiful cinematography, erotica, and score made this clearly the best film of the year so far. I am ready for the DVD."

","As a 15 year old girl, I think this movie was amazing. There was a lot of violence and nudity, but hey, the titles read ""Based on Graphic Novels by Frank Miller"". The colors (or lack there-of) were perfect. Everything was great. The narration was very good. Very clichÃ© to some though. But it's based on a comic book. The direction was very good. The movie had a few plot-points and story lines, but it all tied in perfectly in the end. Bruce Willis was never in a bad movie. Jessica Alba is beautiful, I thought she'd be better than a stripper though after what she had been through. I was very surprised about how she tied in. That one made me say ""Wow"". You'll see what I'm talking about when you see the movie. The acting was pretty decent. I liked basically everything. It's a very good movie so go out and see it.<br/><br/>-Christine"

OK let me start first of all everyone in this movie were great they really captured the spirit of the comic story(as many have said this movie has 3 stories each connected to the other but the beginning and the end both have the hit-man (hartman) who has a very creepy look and sound to him (i for one will be using the *can i offer you a smoke* pickup line from now on) we then jump to more boobs and sex in 5-6 minutes than most porn movies... Marv awakes to Goldie dead and so begins the beautiful action scenes the violence in this movie has 3 styles ""mild, over the top,and plain out disgusting"" Marv actually jumps through a windshield and you see the cuts bleeding constantly sometime red sometimes white after we meet his parolee officer we finally see one of the most creepy characters i have ever seen in a movie (wood) who is a cannibal with long sharpened fingernails with silence of a ninja and the claws of a angry female after Marv's story (which ends nicely) we move on to the most entertaining of the 3 stories (old town) a town ruled by women (valkries) we are then introduced to *jackie-boy*(toro) who is a *** and a woman beater with a voice so deep you would think Vader is in his soul but he gets his 3 or 4 times in a row skimming over the really good parts just know you can definitely tell when Terantino jumps in *give ya a hint think pulp fiction reservoir dogs and kill bill* and comes MIHO Miho is absolutely the coolest chick in this movie killing with a animal like instinct but keeping with the group SOON we get along to the final story about what happened to old Mr.Hartigan who saved little Nancy but was back-stabbed by his partner jeez that yellow bastard he gets what coming to him... frank miller did a great thing letting this movie be made this is probably one of the best movies to see in theaters and i definitely suggest seeing it"

I thought ""Sin City"" was probably as good as it could have gotten. However, when I first saw the movie, I was expecting a little more--but, hey? Who doesn't expect that from a movie?? I think the critics' review of ""It's a comic book brought to life and pumped with steroids!"" is probably the perfect and best way to describe it.

","As a loyal fan of the Sin City comics, I can confidently and proudly say that the movie is even better. In one word the movie is FLAWLESS. Rodriguez has created a surreal world that is jaw-dropping to see. But unlike other popular movies like Spiderman, you never notice that you are watching special effects and it all feels real.The action is stunning and hilarious at the same time. The actors bring their characters to life better than I hoped for and Mickey Rourke and Benicio Del Toro are particularly phenomenal. I could not ask for more from this absolutely ass-kicking, smart, funny,wild ride that even features gorgeous women that even the morons who don't appreciate this movie will like."
"antoncohen","10","0","3","2 April 2005"," Stunning, perfectly executed
","A great movie, Sin City isn't like your average comic book movie were it's just the comic characters and some of the story turned into a movie, it is as if the actual pages of the comic book came alive. Extremely stylish. The movie is in black & white, with touches of primary and secondary color. Like a dress in red, or blonde hair yellow, eyes blue. It in the most unique movie I've ever seen, not just for the style, but the way things played out. They didn't pull any punches, it is extremely violent/gory, but not in a gruesome way. The violence is done with style, not as over the top as Kill Bill Vol.1, but it has some humor to it. I don't think there is anything about Sin City that could have been done better, everything was executed perfectly. But it isn't all style, the characters feel so authentic - in a comic book way. They are not simply going through the motions, you knew why they are doing what they are doing, it is in their character. The cast is excellent, good acting all around. And beautiful female nudity.<br/><br/>If you like anything Quentin Tarantino's done, you'll love this movie. But if you think it's just some comic book based movie to take the kids to, don't."
"mysterylad","10","0","3","2 April 2005"," Wicked, brutal fun!
","Sin City is without a doubt the single most loyal comic book adaptation ever filmed, a distinction previously held by The Rocketeer. How did such a loyal adaptation come out of the notoriously fickle and haphazard Hollywood movie machine? Easy...it didn't. Director Robert Rodriguez shot the film independent of Hollywood influence, securing the financing on his own and shooting the film his own way. Sin City also has the benefit of direct, hands-on involvement by series creator Frank Miller, who actually co-directed the film alongside Rodriguez (a move that cost Rodriguez his membership in the Director's Guild and his next scheduled job at Paramount). The original Sin City graphic novels were used as storyboards for the film, with Miller drawing some new bits to make sure the storyboards were as complete as possible. The entire film is shot digitally in front of a green screen, allowing the filmmakers to create the locations and car chases using CGI, which maintains the comics' surreal flair. These factors combine with a stellar cast to make an incredibly peculiar movie, but a great one nonetheless.<br/><br/>Adapted from three of the Sin City graphic novels (and one of the numerous short stories Miller has produced over the years), the storyline is actually quite simple--the various tarnished champions of this ""town without pity"" find themselves in conflict with the power brokers of their extremely corrupt city, and violence ensues--but its non-linear storytelling sets it apart from the typical revenge play. Each story in Sin City has some connection to the others, adding the dimension of an Easter egg hunt to the proceedings as the audience figures out just what takes place when. There is quite a bit of repetition, both thematic and situational, but said repetition is obviously intentional, driving home the sheer brutality of the film's titular setting.<br/><br/>The cast is sheer genius, from the smallest parts to the leads. Bruce Willis, Mickey Rourke, Jessica Alba, Benicio del Toro, Clive Owen, Rosario Dawson, and a dozen more avowed fans of the original comics literally bring Miller's characters to life, warts and all, for better or for worse. The performances are over-blown in the classic film noir model, creating an atmosphere that is in no way realistic...but realism isn't Sin City's goal. This is crime fiction gone off the deep end, and it's a riot. You see, here's the thing about Sin City: it's an absurdly overwrought, unapologetically brutal riff on the pulp fiction of a bygone era, and it's incredibly over-the-top...maybe even ""hammy."" In fact, despite its violence (which is extreme and pervasive) and its sex (handled with much more restraint than the violence, although there is quite a bit of nudity), Sin City is positively hilarious...provided you come into it knowing what the movie is supposed to be. Luckily, the cast and filmmakers are obviously very aware of what made the original comics such a guilty pleasure in the first place.<br/><br/>In short, if you like the Sin City comics, Sin City the movie will not disappoint. If you don't like the comics, you won't like the movie.<br/><br/>It doesn't get much simpler than that, really..."

","As I sat at the well- respected theater ( the kind that serves beer ) that was kind enough to show this film at 12 o'clock am 4-1-05, I contemplated, will this be it? Will this be the film that the real comic( or should I say graphic novel ) fans have waited for? Was it now worth sitting through the previous comic-book movie attempts Hollywood had given us?( minus the good ones X-2,Daredevil,Hellboy,Blade2,League of Ex..,and Spiderman2) Then it happened. The lights dimmed. The previews started. These were the hardest thing to sit through!! ( except I can say I deeply enjoyed the EpIII trailer )Then I saw the flames. As the Troublemaker Studios screen came on I held my Todd McFarlane: Marv-holding-Kevin's-head action-figure close, I kissed my( 8 months- pregnant) wife sitting next to me and spoke these words ""I'll see you in 2 hours!"". Then this 32 year old comic fan sat for the aforementioned 2 hours and felt every emotion and every word that these two creators placed in front of me (us). This work of art is the reason that films show motion and play sound. This joy is the proof that real talent and determination have finally showed their faces, larger than life,on film.

"vitalogst","9","0","3","2 April 2005"," Fantastic
","I have always been a big fan of Frank Miller's comic books, and I am not disappointed by his writing here, which is as solid as anything else he's done, but what is surprising is how well the visual side of things was done, but I suppose that a lot of credit would have to go to co-director Robert Rodriguez. Besides co-direction Rodriguez also shot, edited, and helped score the film. The acting was top notch with great turns by Clive Owen, Mickey Rourke, Bruce Willis, and Benicio Del Toro, but I felt that the Ladies in the film Rosario Dawson, Britney Murphy and Jessica Alba, had little more to do than be damsels in distress and really, really, effective eye candy. The place where the acting and writing really shines is in the voice over dialog, it seems as if plucked right out of a 1950's film noir, the right mix of grit and nerve with some tenderness and a feeling of wanting to do something right. There are three vignettes in the film each focusing on Rourke, Owen, and Willis, and they all fit together eventually, as any serpentine plot should! What I really appreciated was that while each was from different sides of law enforcement, each seem to have a similar thought pattern, manner of speech, and ideology, showing that while their methods are different essentially these are just guys down on their luck and looking to help somebody out. Overall I though this film was really strong, excellent use of color and sound to help give a comic book feel and look and excellent performances, unfortunately only from the males in this case, and an overall cohesiveness in a pretty disjointed narrative. I really hope that Miller decides to put out another film and if there is a God it will be Dark Knight Returns. Brandon"
"nhikrath","9","0","3","2 April 2005"," Episodic Hardcore Unrelenting
","The movie starts off strong with a classically Noir situation of an over-the-hill cop letting things get personal, then speeds up quickly with an unrelentingly disturbing and awe inspiring revenge plot. The entire movie is essentially driven by the inner turmoil of the three main characters.<br/><br/>The book-ending episode featuring Bruce Willis might qualify as the most touching, but for me nothing's better than the completely raw visceral ride that Mickey Rourke's episode takes us on. For this episode, I think I can count on one hand the number of shots that don't include nudity, sex, blood, babes, or awesomely drenching rain. That is to say, this episode rocks.<br/><br/>The Clive Owen episode brings this roller-coaster to a screeching halt, not so much because it's less action, but moreso because it's boring. Granted, this episode would probably rock on its own as a short, but in following the Marv episode, this episode totally drags on and on and on with no character motivation other than ""I don't want somebody to get hurt or be in a specific location,"" and negatively-motivated spine plots always suck.<br/><br/>The movie is also bookended by a Josh Hartnett thing, but that's just a tangent. The real heart of this movie for me was the Marv (Mickey Rourke) section which is essentially a very awesome, totally ass-kicking romp where every character we meet dies by the end. This is what moody comic-book adaptations should be: cold, violent, and dizzyingly fast-paced, not some BS involving a see-saw (AKA Daredevil).<br/><br/>Go see it, if only for the section starring Mickey Rourke."

","Robert Rodriguez scores big with Sin City. And good thing, too, after Once Upon a Time in Mexico. The film was a treat. Part campy, part old-time noir, part comic book, visually stunning & ALL GOOD. The acting seems a little stiff in parts, but I think that's by design, as all of the characters try not to show too much emotion, though we get the feeling (especially in Mickey Rourke's case) that they are FULL of emotion. The make-up could have been a little better on Rourke, but everything else in the film is pretty much flawless. It's definitely destined to be a classic that people will want to watch many times over. And Carla Gugino shows us her ""WOW, I DIDN'T KNOW SHE HAS THOSE"" rack. 'Nuff Said."

"manfesto","10","0","3","2 April 2005"," The best movie I've seen in a while
","Three amazing slightly intertwining story arcs make for one of the best movies I've seen in recent memory. This is a stylistic powerhouse of a movie - from beginning to end, almost every shot was taken directly from a frame within the pages of ""Sin City."" This is evident in some rather unconventional camera angles and color accents that add up to a refreshingly new and different viewing experience. The amazing black and white accents in blood and on Kevin's glasses and other such nuances are nothing short of impressive and really accent the few bits of color strewn about the movie, making clear the character's realities are, for brief moments in time, something more than the black and white, live or die realities they've grown all too used to. The dialogue is occasionally a bit campy and overdone, but this is understandable and almost necessary given the moody backdrop. Every actor and actress plays their part to perfection, and it doesn't hurt to have had a few scenes ""guest"" directed by Mr. Quentin Tarantino either (when you go see it, try and guess which ones! Not that it's very hard to tell). All this makes for one of the most unique, consistently stylistic movies I've ever seen, and (thus far) the only comic book/graphic novel adaptation really worth seeing. For that, I give a 10/10"

","Wow....I just exited Sin City and it is nothing short of amazing. The most hyped aspect of the film, the visuals, grab you immediately, and just when you think you've seen every trick in the directors' bag, something else leaps out at you, whether it is an unexpected permutation of color or some camera movement that simply wouldn't be possible in the real world. The advantages to shooting in HD on the digital back lot are very apparent from the opening shot, and if Sky Captain didn't sell you on the technology (it didn't exactly do it for me), then this movie will. However, it wouldn't have any impact if we, the audience, didn't care about the characters. Dwight..Hartigan...The Yellow Bastard...Miho...Nancy...all are names that will reside in your head instantly. Special mention goes to Mickey Rourke as Marv, who personifies a bad-ass street tough with his gravelly inflection and wonderfully weathered, prosthetic face. Again, I can't stress enough how visually pleasing the film is, and even if you don't care for the extreme violence or hard-boiled dialog, at least treat your eyes to something special."

I have only read a few of the comics before going to this film, and the comic ""That Yellow Bastard"" is Brude Willis' story line. I could've quoted the entire parts because they were almost word for word the same as the comic series. <br/><br/>Considering the other movies that were based on comic book series (ie. Hulk, Daredevil, and the terrible Elektra), it was refreshing to see a comic series that actually followed the series and not making a movie that is based on the characters. <br/><br/>Let's not forget about the film techniques. The entire movie filmed in front of a green screen couldn't have been a better idea. The original comics are almost completely in black and white and the green screen was able to provide the effect perfectly. It's not the first movie to do this, but they still use the effect perfectly.<br/><br/>Overall, the movie was pretty good.

Don't let some other adaptations from graphic novels (Punisher, anyone?) dissuade you from seeing this movie. It's a roller coaster ride of a movie and I loved every minute of it.

Sin Night is a time when you have that extra cheeseburger, buy that book you've had your eye on, or finally try out that new ice cream spot. You do what you have to to fulfill an inner need, and in the end you feel happy and gleeful. SIn City was the movie equivalent of Sin Night, and how appropriate that name has become. It is violent, it is brutal, it shows you things most movies would come close to. Dismemberment, nudity, and torture; these are throwaway pieces of the film. And one of the best line's I've ever heard in a movie, ""...Is that all you've got?"" See this, trust me. If you let yourself indulge in the guilty pleasure of this moral vacuum, you'll have a blast."

","I had high hopes for Sin City, and I was definitely not disappointed. I have always enjoyed films by Robert Rodriguez; I love his dark humor and his appreciation of the grotesque. I think Sin City is a movie that pulls no punches - Mickey Rourke did a great job as Marv, shading his turn as a killer with degrees of humanity and pathos. Many other fine performances here; loved Bruce Willis, Rutger Hauer(creepy), Elijah Wood (creepier), and many others. The pulpy dialogue was perfect, and I couldn't take my eyes off the gorgeous cinematography. The violence was cartoonlike (what a surprise!); my husband and I laughed through most of it, and we weren't the only ones. If you have ever seen any movies by Robert Rodriguez, you know what to expect; he has an uncompromising vision that we could use more of in film today."

","While I have not read any of Frank Miller's Sin City graphic novels I must say that he, Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarintino put this movie together quite well. Not only is the story and acting superb but the editing and shots they use are truly amazing. With the exception of Michael Clark Duncan's character I felt that all of the characters were given a well amount of time to work their character into the story and show where he or she is coming from within the Sin City universe. I also liked Elijah Wood's character Kevin I felt that he brought a very creepy mysterious element to it that the rest didn't also the darkness that cloaks the evil in this movie is quite well put together also with a Cardinal, Senator (and his son), and a crooked cop as the main baddie element in the story. Over all i give this movie a superb 10/10 anything better would have made my head spin rapidly and explode in a theater near you."

","Sin City blew me away. Visually, it was one of the coolest movies I have ever seen. The film is in black & white, with color interspersed in certain items (such as a girl's blue eyes or a woman's red dress). I thought it was pretty fascinating to see a major film shot this way. Some of the scenes are very comic-book (it is based on Frank Miller's graphic novels) and I loved that. The movie was very over-the-top...but in a way that I really enjoyed. Very interesting plot lines and I was as interested as could be throughout the entire film. Though make sure you know...the movie is very graphic and has just a tad bit of blood. It's mostly done in an over-the-top way, as mentioned, but be aware. In any case, for my money, Sin City is a must-see."

","The Movie Sin City was an awesome story of love,hate,and revenge. The characters mixed and mingled together quiet nicely. The story's are extremely devoted to the graphic novels. The actors playing them are perfect for the characters maybe expect Clive Owen but was he OK. The parts of the story's were not confusing and you could figure out which one was which. Also even though Jessica Alba wasn't nude she doesn't have to be in order to play the role well. Also all the main men in comics were fully nude but who want's to see that. The movie is stunning and visually appealing. The blood could have been all red for my taste but for get the point anyway. The movie should hopefully make most if not all it's money back and should have a sequel to finish it off. I give the comic to movie adaptation 98%.<br/><br/>9 out of 10"

","Sin City, is based upon the comics of the same name by Frank Miller, who also co-directed the film. The film is in black and white and looks like a film noir from the 40's. All the male characters are tough as nails and smoke and wear trench coats and all the female characters are scantily dressed prostitutes. There is only some things in the movie that show colour such as a character's blue eyes or a red dress on a character. The story has several different stories all involving a lot of action and a lot of energy. Sin City, has good direction. a good script, good performances from everyone involved, good original music, good cinematography, good film editing, good set decoration and good makeup and visual effects. Sin City, is an excellent looking movie with it's costumes, sets, makeup and black and white cinematography that looks like it has come right out of the 40's. It should definitely be nominated for some awards just for the way the film looks. The film took a little while for me to get into because it starts right off with a bang and has non stop action which at first I found hard to get into because it was hard to get character development and concentrate on one thing for too long. But by the third story starring Clive Owen, and Benicio Del Toro, I was into the movie and was enjoying this very exciting and energy pumped ride. The film is extremely unique and original, is well made, has great dialogue, has interesting characters, is an interesting film to look at, is a very entertaining film, is fun, exhilarating, has some funny moments and is a visually stunning and entertaining film. The film is very violent and is not for young kids but I have been told it is very faithful to the comic books it is based on and having not liked many movies based on comic books I can tell you that this one holds out, and it holds out well and is really a very good film. One of the most entertaining films of the year so far and also one of the most original."

"ianlind","8","0","3","1 April 2005"," Sin City
","Sin City begins as though the viewer were watching Pulp Fiction: a scene of slick discussion between a man and a woman, ending in a twist. However, whereas Tarantino uses realism throughout Pulp, Robert Rodriguez and Frank Miller use a fantastical world in which ridiculous events occur. The events are so ridiculous, in fact, that the viewer can not help but smile at it. In this regard, Sin City is a cross between Pulp Fiction and Spiderman. The characters are the low-lifes of Pulp Fiction, and yet the action and high-definition filming is that of Spiderman. The unique difference that makes Sin City different is the way that Rodriguez portrays the movie as if it were a comic book. The actors deliver their lines as though you were watching a B-rate movie from the 1950's, and the narration is like a crime movie, with a cop taking care of the situation. Some may not like the way that Rodriguez does this, but it is new to watch, as other comic book movies have not achieved as much as Sin City. Much of this is thanks to Miller, who wrote the graphic material not seen in a comic book movie like Spiderman or The Incredible Hulk. The dramatic way that Rodriguez brings a book to the screen is enough to keep the viewer paying attention throughout the movie, and therefore is not as boring as many critics suggest. Rodriguez's gift is that he takes a comic book and makes it a film noir that can even be mentioned in the same breath as Pulp Fiction, a movie many consider to be a textbook in film noir. All in all the movie is entertaining and interesting, not only for the way that Rodriguez intertwines the stories, but in the way that the actors portray their respective characters. The cast includes Clive Owen, Bruce Willis, Mickey Rourke, Jessica Alba, Elijah Wood, Michael Madsen, Brittany Murphy, and Benicio Del Toro, among others."

","Sin City is the best movie of 2005. It includes an all star cast who work brilliantly together and know each others strengths and weaknesses. The way the movie is filmed is just breathtaking; Robert Rodriguez did an excellent job of portraying Frank Miller's graphic novel to the greatest extent. Although it might be a bit gory, it is a movie that any fan of comic book movies should see. Fans of any Tarantino movie or fans of any film noir style films should enjoy the mastery of the filming style that Rodriguez utilizes. This movie is the best movie of 2005, as of right now, and should be a hit all around the world."
"dave-1617","10","0","4","1 April 2005"," Incredible
","Cinematography: Is surreal, mainly monochrome with some intense lighting (contrast) effects, with vivid and subtle splashes of chrominance. From what I read before seeing the movie, it was shot to mimic the fine details of the comic artwork, it does, I have never seen anything like it.<br/><br/>Storyline: When the graphic violence spills onto the screen it is like nothing I have ever seen in a movie. It is so gratuitous it makes Pulp Fiction look like a Disney G movie. After the first 15 minutes I finally realized ""this is a representation of a DARK comic book"" I am 45 years old and it was very reminiscent of the Batman TV series of the 60's with the Biff!!! and Pow!! replaced with Frank Miller's incredible vision of action.<br/><br/>Acting: At first glance it appears cheesy. However, once you begin to connect with the characters one begins to realize the requirement this film had for the well seasoned actors. I believe it is sometimes more difficult for an actor to pull off a wildly fictional role and have it appear matter-of-factly than it is to fall into a serious persona and just appear normal to the role.<br/><br/>Entertainment Factor: Well... I experienced everything from indigestion (I just ate before the film and was not quite ready for the gore) to arousal (quite possibly some of the best ""art"" photography of the female form) and even a few Guffaws (If you told me that I would be laughing out loud by the end of the film five minutes into it I would never have believed you)<br/><br/>Probably not an Acadamy Award winner, But, definitely a visual masterpiece for what it is. Miller definitely did what he came to do, it is like watching a comic."
"BigWheels","Null","0","3","1 April 2005"," Scene for scene frame for frame its was the comic.
","Sin City has always been one of my favorite comics. What amazed me the most was how true down to so small and trivial details it was exactly like the comic. Of course not all the actors could look like the way Miller drew them but that is nothing that can be helped. <br/><br/>In an attempt to be super true to the comic they pulled off the visuals is a wonderful way. Cuz in the end it's a film not a comic and some things just won't be right unless maybe they animated it. They made a mistake I think though in trying to use word for word dialogue. Many of the actors seemed strained to repeat them and it didn't always seem natural. The best at it was Jessica Alba, maybe because she didn't have so many ""one liners"".<br/><br/>on another note it is an extremely violent movie anyone who can't stomache such things should probably stay away. I wouldn't bring the kids.<br/><br/>As far as people who have read the comic I think you will be happy with it but a few scenes from the comic are not in the movie. which does change a few things but not much.<br/><br/>All and all though an excellent adaptation 9/10"
"dragonstrider","10","0","4","1 April 2005"," My Kind of Town...
","Sin City is a visually stunning addition to the genre of film noir movies. Gritty and highly stylized, this is perhaps the first ""comic book movie"" that stays true to the original model. There are darkly inspired acting performances by a dedicated cast, and Elijah Wood is especially frightening as Kevin.<br/><br/>I'm not one to get drawn into a movie just because it's popular; it has to be truly special for me to like it. Given that, please believe me when I say this is the best film I've seen since The Usual Suspects, and that's pretty high praise as far as I'm concerned.<br/><br/>One final note, special props should go out to director Rodriguez for giving Frank Miller a well-deserved co-directing credit at the cost of his guild membership. More people today should have such strong convictions."

","With some of the most obscene vulgarities probably ever brought to screen, Sin City is not for the faint. But shot masterfully in black and white showing only accents of color occasionally, artistically, it is really is a spectacle to behold. Yes, it's gruesome and hard to stomach at times, but it also highly entertaining and good for a laugh if you can handle the humor. Many of the performances were also unforgettable, especially Benicio Del Toro and Mickey Rourke who were simply hilarious. All in all, its very well done and quite worth the movie going experience. I give it a 9 out of 10 because it felt a whole lot longer than it actually was, which is odd because there was never a dull moment."

","It is an honor to see such a great film from such a great creator. Frank Miller's comics were and are brilliant but there was always something missing. In all of his work there was an element that did not come through in the comics. You could see it and feel it. You knew what Miller was trying to do and even though it was 99% there, that extra little touch or element that would put it over the top and make it a masterpiece was missing ... after seeing Sin City I know what that missing element was. Frank Miller's work is meant to be on the big screen and seen and appreciated as a movie ... if you loved or even liked Millers work in the comic books you will be blown away with the movie.<br/><br/>Hands down, no one comes close, it is what others have tried and failed to achieve ...

","From the stunning beauty of the actresses to the incredible cinematography and moods, this movie is a work of art. It was so simple to believe that I was watching a comic book made real, with the sometimes cheesy dialogue, over-the-top violence (which while gory, was never TOO much, in my opinion) and well done camera angles, which is easy to miss in comics, but sometimes makes the scene.<br/><br/>I thought it felt like a Mickey Spillane book, as thrown through the ringer by Edgar Allen Poe. Don't hold your breath for happy endings, but I guess that's also depends on your point of view.<br/><br/>Another well-done touch was the black-and-white with splashes of color. It was perfectly done, kind of like that one girl in ""Schindler's List."" ""Sin City"" made far more use of color, but again it always tended to either give extra depth to characters or increase a scene's impact.<br/><br/>Boy, is this NOT a date movie."
"steric23","7","0","2","1 April 2005"," Sin City's sins are Gluttony and Sloth, but forgivable...
","Sin City lives up to its sleazy moniker with high gloss and style. As expected, there's nary a shred of redemption in this hard-boiled film adaptation of Frank Miller's Sin City series, however, it carries with it a feeling of guilty pleasure, no matter how brutal and sadistic.<br/><br/>That said, the violence is highly stylized and defined by comic book physics. Characters are exploded, bullet blasted, even emphatically mutilated. No one dies until they're deliberately written out. The flick is literally pieced together by the panels that make up the graphic novels. It's shot in high contrast black and white with vibrant splotches of color to accentuate specific objects. The world this effect intones is completely convincing, unforgiving, and *cool*. <br/><br/>The cast can get away with a lot of toss away lines because they're in such a cool movie. Understanding that this was a very faithful adaptation,it would take a really stellar talent to pull off lines like ""Kill him for me. Kill him good...""or ""I've been killin my way to the truth..."". But it is what it is. These words were born in little white bubbles. <br/><br/>On the performance side, Mickey Rourke makes this movie likable. He brings a lot of charm to the hulking, ugly brute Marv. His takes gleeful delight in the Hard Goodbye he gives to his Hooker With the Heart of Gold's murderers. Marv won over the theater audience who were pretty wary up till his entrance in the first of four lisle entwined sequences.. After him, it's hard to find characters to get behind, even though they're familiar faces. You kind of have to side with Bruce Willis's Hartigan, but he's trying to save a little girl from the rape murder promised by That Yellow Bastard, so what choice do you have? <br/><br/>The rest of the cast is suitable, even if it does feel like cameos. the story is self aware so it doesn't leave them much room for preening in like say, Oceans Tweleve. Bencio Del Toro will freak you out yet again. There's lots of Sin here. Plenty of lust, greed, and wrath. Lots and lots of wrath. Sin City comes close to drowning in it's own blood, though, as it recycles it's themes of Pride and revenge through constant, detached monologue. Fortunately, the visuals and high intensity atmosphere make Sin City the ride a comic book flick should be."

I use the word ""translation"" because that is exactly what it is, it is merely the comic panels brought to life. And boy does it work, the dazzling visuals and powerful imagery create a vivid portrait of a city that no one ever wants to visit. The streets and alley ways are overflowing with corruption and perversion. The film presents its subject matter in unapologetic form, presenting the violence and garishness as it is, in your face and uncensored. Needless to say I loved every second of it. From the melodramatic dialogue (I feel like a palsy victim doing brain surgery with a lead pipe, a line Bruce Willis utters in one of his narratives), to the over the top characters (Elijah Wood's character, Kevin, being among my favorites). The movie, mostly in black and white, has sporadic splashes of color that are used to accentuate a part of the film. The blood was so vivid in some scenes you could almost taste it. Frank Miller has said that he uses color as a weapon, and nothing could be more true. I just hope that Hollywood sits up and takes notice, and starts to realize that it does not have to put out formula film after formula film, that inventiveness and art is not a bad thing. Walk down the right back alley in sin city and you can find anything, even a great film."

","A stunning, outstanding achievement. Will be remembered as a classic.<br/><br/>Easy to follow episodes difficult to fit together as a single story. Tarintino style plotting not strictly as necessary for this movie as it was for Pulp Fiction. True, though, this gives a certain graphic novel 'tight episode' feel to the story.<br/><br/>At least for me there was not that same degree of epiphany that comes when a non-sequential plot becomes clear(er). There is a moment that creates some of that emotional irony, but it feels more like it was in the service of knitting together the graphic novels' story lines, as opposed pulling together an emotional story line. <br/><br/>Still, this one should get some academy award nominations for truly inspired art direction and make up. Characters are brilliantly translated from the graphic to the cinematic.<br/><br/>Dialogue toys with the viewers' knowledge of 'comic book' and detective writing clichÃ©s, verging on the silly but with just enough self-mockery to redeem itself.

"jackjasper","9","0","3","1 April 2005"," A treat for newcomers and fans alike
","Firstly, let me say that if you aren't familiar with Sin City, make sure you can stomach violence. A lot of it.<br/><br/>Miller and Rodriguez's creation boasts plenty of it, all deftly green-screen shot and painted with stark blacks and whites, save the odd splash of color. Many of the notable actors featured in the film boast prosthetic makeup, surprising costumes, or simply no dialog for their characters.<br/><br/>Does this mean you won't enjoy the movie? Hell no. Sin City, as a film, is comprised of three story-arcs from the comic series of the same name. The three stories are presented non-linearly (think Pulp Fiction) and bleed into each other at the edges, providing what may be a jarring narrative for newcomers, but one that ultimately makes sense.<br/><br/>Look past the bloodshed of each one, and you'll find that each story's core is a romance. THe characters speak in larger-than-life dialog, with Miller's writing more deft than most in the business today. There is no traditional ""good guy"" in Sin City, but the villains levels of depravity make the crimes of the ""heroes"" seem insubstantial.<br/><br/>Elmore Leonard's ""Payback"" is a wonderful example of this on two levels. Firstly, the inner monologue of the protagonist provides a method, a reasoning for the actions that drive them. And secondly, when all the pieces have fallen into place, you find yourself genuinely rooting for the ""heroes"" in the face of their injustices.<br/><br/>While longtime fans of the comics will notice several things that are slightly changed (primarily in That Yellow Bastard) the film as a whole is, to date, the most successful direct translation of a comic i've seen, as well as one of the most enjoyable. So get a babysitter for the kids and go wallow in some Sin."

I don't even know what Tarantino, listed as a guest director, had to do with this movie, maybe he just wanted to hang out while it was being made.

","Five minutes into SIN CITY, I was pretty sure that I had stumbled into a baaaaaaad movie. I defy anyone to sit through the opening scene-- a man and woman standing on a balcony spouting typical private-eye time dialog with typical private-eye first-person narration-- and not be reminded of a recent commercial for ""Flonase"". As the opening scenes progress, the elaborate visual style comic-noir only seemed to make the narrative seem more slap-dash and hyperbolic, a caricature. The artifice took me farther away, not closer to the story. I couldn't stop being aware that the actors were standing in front of wind machines, and that drove me crazy. I wondered if I would be walking out.<br/><br/>Fortunately, I stayed, and I was gradually seduced into accepting this film on its own special terms-- and I loved it. ""Sin City"" may be a classic of ""pure cinema"", meaning that it builds on everything that the cinema has always been about, from George Melies to Eisenstein to John Woo. It's not about characters-- it's about images, motion and magic. It's also just about the most violent thing since Homer's Iliad-- but the violence is brilliantly realized-- frightening and witty by turns. Like a Jackie Chan action film, or a keystone cops short, it doesn't give you much to think about when you leave the theater. But I'm pretty sure that I'll be seeing it again."
"ven2s","9","0","1","1 April 2005"," Captivating!
","Frank Miller's Graphic Novels are brought to life, in a way, in this anthology reminiscent of Pulp Fiction but uniquely different. This highly imaginative, violent, and provocative movie is set in the alternate reality of Basin City whose inhabitants are shades of grey to very black. Tough guys of dubious character, put their lives on the line defending or being defended by amazingly strong and deadly beauties. Filled with frames and photo works that are living portrayals of Miller's graphic novels, this movie will keep you hooked from the very beginning to its surprise ending! You'll be talking and thinking about this one, long after the credits have scrolled by."
"vash_da_stampeed","9","0","1","1 April 2005"," original, sexy, and demoniacally excellent
","right from the opening scene this movie had me hooked. the story is not about the characters, but about the city they live in. it follows the lives of about four or five main characters, all whom seem to have one thing in common: Nancy Calahan. whether they actually knew her or just saw her dancing at the club, she is the one thing that ties their stories together. <br/><br/>like i said, right from the beginning, i was hooked. i'm a bit of a fan of both Rodriguez and Tarantino (even if Tarantino only directed one scene), so this was quite a treat for me. the style is simply amazing. everything about it just blows your mind. unfortunately, i've never gotten a chance to read any of the comic books...sorry, ""graphic novels""...but watching this is enough to make me want to go out and buy anything i can get my little mitts on as long as it has Frank Miller's name on it.<br/><br/>Rodriguez's amazing adaption of this already outstanding story (or so i hear) is instantly among my top ten movies, and is certainly one of the best movies i've seen in months. <br/><br/>but the direction isn't everything, the actors were given the chance to show off everything they had. Mickey Rourke certainly gives one of his best performances as Marv the heart- broken bad ass. Bruce Willis also gives quite a spectacular performance. but i think my favorite was Clive Owen and his bright red Converses. he was lovably insane (especially in the car with Benicio Del Toro) and i think everything he did with the character was awesome.<br/><br/>all-in-all this is exactly what we movie lovers have needed for the past year or so. something original, inspiring, and something that's overall breathtaking. it does everything right, and waiting for the movie will be seem like heaven compared to the hell of waiting for the DVD."
"darthchyldx","8","0","1","1 April 2005"," Best movie yet of the 21st Century.
","This movie is by far the best comic based movie to come out. I also believe it will be voted the best movie of the year, let alone the best movie I have seen yet this decade. Go and see this movie while it's in the theaters, don't wait for it to come out on DVD. It has superior acting, directing, and special affects. Everything in it is done perfectly, all the right camera angles, all the right lighting. It sets new standards for movies everywhere. The story is constantly in motion, no boring stops or tricks, it keeps you entertained through out. Its one of those movies where you never want it to end, but when it does, it ends on a very well done note. I underestimated this movie to be more along the lines of whats been coming out lately, but its very different."

","I walked into this movie not even sure what to expect other then that i knew a awesome list of actors and actresses were in it. And i was like if anyhting i'll see my favorite actress (jessica alba). And that i was intrigued by the cinematography. It was very appealing in a way that i hadn't seen a movie filmed like that before, although Sky Captins from the world of tomorrow was close. But this movie was so much better! Everything was just great from visually to acting, and just the way it was cut! I saw this last night around midnight or so. And i soooo want to see this again. It was just amazing and puts this movie as one of my all time favorites. The story line is fantastic, i love how it develops through out the movie."
"the-movie-guy","10","0","4","1 April 2005"," You will love Sin City or hate it, no in-between
","Sin City comes to life on the screen directly off the pages of Frank Miller's comic book series. Sin City (Basin City) is a violent city where the police are crooked, crime is rampant in the streets, and the women are beautiful and deadly. The film is a collection of three story lines that connect all the characters to Sin City. The main character is Marv (Mickey Rourke) a street thug who is framed for the murder of a gorgeous and kind prostitute, Goldie (Jaime King), while she was asleep in his bed. To avenge the death of Goldie, Marv sets out on a mission of violence where no one better get in his way. The second storyline is Dwight (Clive Owen) a friend and old flame of the head of the Sin City hookers, who gets caught up in the killing of a corrupt cop and must cover it up to save the girls. The third storyline is about a policeman, Hartigan (Bruce Willis), who was only one hour away from early retirement, but instead of retiring, is shot and arrested and put in jail for 8 years for a crime he didn't commit.<br/><br/>The movie was shot in black-and-white and some color to give the look and tone reflective of the pen and ink of the comic book pages. It is loaded with nudity and violence and is not recommended to the squeamish. The violence doesn't look that bad, even with several killing scenes and body parts flying everywhere. You don't notice the horror as much, because the color of the blood isn't red. You can also tell that the story lines are from comic books, because all the heroes are either shot, run over by a car, tortured and beaten to a pulp, but still survive. I think Marv, the character Mickey Rourke played, was the best of the three stories. This movie was entertaining and not your typical movie; you will either love it or hate it, no in-between. (Dimension Films, Run time 2:06, Rated R)(10/10)"
"lost4wurds","Null","0","3","1 April 2005"," Fantastic Movie but not for everyone
","I just saw Sin City and would like to say that anyone who has had the pleasure of reading Frank Miller's books should really run out and see this one. It's a great re-imagining of Miller's three best novels. Though there are some noticeable omissions, I found the movie to be quite complete and throughly enjoyable.<br/><br/>Note of caution though: To people that don't know Miller's work or don't appreciate the film noir style, this movie might not be for you. The hokey dialog will throw off some and make otherwise tense moments laughable. So take it all with a grain of salt and if you can wrap your head around the way the film is presented and if you can appreciate the style in which Miller writes, then you should love it.<br/><br/>Solid flick! 8/10"
"jyriliargael","10","0","7","1 April 2005"," Best Movie of the Year
","This is easily the best movie of the year from start to finish. Sin City is the most awesome film to ever grace my unworthy eyes. Not only have I never seen a movie like this before, but I entirely doubt I will ever see one like it again. The cast of the movie was incredible and the style and progression was simply fantastic. I seriously doubt there will be a sitting of this movie that doesn't get some type of reaction from the audience... Call it ""shock value"", call it ""gruesome"" or ""gorey"", call it whatever you want...but the movie provokes an amazing response that kept me wanting to see more and more.<br/><br/>This movie makes Kill Bill 1&2, Once Upon a Time in Mexico, and just about any other amazingly action-packed, gore-filled and violent flick look something like Bambi. <br/><br/>I definitely recommend this movie to anyone with a stomach for violence and a love for a great movie. You'll find it difficult to spend 2 hours and 6 minutes better at a theater, and I can guarantee it won't be a film anywhere near as good."
"adam-555","10","0","9","1 April 2005"," Guest Director Quentin
","Sin City is the next Pulp Fiction. I saw the sneak peak tonight - one night before its release. I can see it now, teenagers pouring into the theatres to see the latest eye candy suspense thriller, not to mention the gorgeous, emphasize gorgeous, women, and continuous yet humorous violence. And let me be one of the first to tell you...ITS EYE CANDY. I could not get over the whole artsy fartsy aspect of the film. It honestly looks like a comic book. Frank Miller really outdid himself. Truly one of the best films I've seen in a while. You become so entangled in the story that by the end you just gasp for air because you've been holding your breath so long. The film is divided into three distinct sequences, following a different part of the story and told from a different character but magically all tied together in the end, similar to Pulp Fiction.<br/><br/>How involved was Quentin?"
"cliffbee","10","0","6","1 April 2005"," Graphic but good
","I saw the movie on a sneak preview. I was a fan from the novels before but the movie did it some justice. You have to know what your getting into before you step into the movie. The movie is written well & the actors are very good. Some are worse than others. But hey its a movie. You have to form your own opinion about it. One thing that bugged me about the movie was that it kept going from color to black & white. They should have picked one & stuck to it. Another thing was Elijah Wood as some killer that wasn't very realistic @ all. The special effects were awesome. It looked like Quentin directed most of the movie instead of guest director. I liked how the movie came full circle from the beginning to the end, it tied it all together. very well done."
"greg_wilson","Null","0","5","1 April 2005"," The perfect evolution of graphic novel and cinema
","Most experts believe that when we dream, we dream in black and white. If that's the case, when Frank Miller dreams, that black and white world is splattered with red violence and yellow fear and the gray that accompany the inner turmoil of characters straddling good and evil. In Sin City, the film adaptation of three of a series of Miller's graphic novels of the same name, Robert Rodriguez duplicates the essence of those dreams and takes the art of film to a place it has never been.<br/><br/>In a panel by panel homage to the art and vision of Miller, Sin City rips the ink right out of the comic book and injects it into your bloodstream. Clearly influenced, if not replicating, the spirit and cadence of classic film noir, Miller's stories are visceral and ache in the pain of the anti-heroes of each of the three stories. Told in a disjointed Pulp Fiction style timeline, the three stories are always held together by the dark, wet backdrop of Sin City itself.<br/><br/>Bruce Willis plays a half-dead cop wanting to do the right thing for a young girl one last time at any cost. In the second vignette, Mickey Rourke transforms himself brilliantly into a gentle, lumbering chunk of violence searching for vengeance and beauty in the filthy hole that is his world. Lastly Clive Owen channels a reluctant hero caught in a web of violence and obligation. Each character is flawed and fractured and ultimately human in an extraordinary way. Littered with an amazing blend of talent surrounding them, all of the characters in Sin City bleed, cry, kill and die like only good comic book characters can.<br/><br/>Dripping with stylized film noir dialogue and syrupy, tactile visuals, Sin City transports the audience into the world of the comic, and blends the two art forms in a way that has been attempted many times but never accomplished. However, this is a film that will either be loved or hated. Sin City is excessively violent. Rodriguez doesn't flinch the camera from scenes that, although cartoonish in nature, are at their core depraved. The dialogue also can seem campy if the vision of what the film is trying to be gets lost.<br/><br/>Ultimately Sin City is like no other move you have ever seen, and will most certainly go down as Rodriguez's best film to date. It is bare, and bold, and necessary. In the end, Rodriguez shows us Miller's Sin City dream world and creates something new and disturbingly exciting in the process."
"danymation","9","0","6","1 April 2005"," A great stylized film noir, gripping, and intense.
","This movie is intense, and therefore not for everybody. However, if you can handle it, and you want a gritty film noir in your face journey, boy has Robert Rodriguez cooked up a T-Bone. Besides the Brilliant, innovative, and cinematic ally orgasmic visual effects, this movie has a lot to offer. The acting is phenomenal, especially by Bruce Willis, and Benicio Del Torro, the suspense is edge of your seat. In addition, the stories, as they are in the comics, are gripping and get you going right along with the characters, which are rich in personality. The movie is simply magnificent and sets the bar for its style, if not reinventing it altogether. There are those who wont like it, buts that's because they can't handle this type of movie, or they're just into other genres, but either way this one will leave some scars. The Hype: For those of you who are fans of Robert Rodriguez and/or Quentin Terantino work, you will be blown away. For those of you who are comic book fans you will be blown away, for this is as true to Frank Miller's masterpiece as can be got."
"llmollyll","9","0","3","1 April 2005"," David Lynch on acid -- is that possible?
","I honestly wasn't thrilled about seeing this film until I was invited to an advanced screening. I knew that the cinematography would be striking, but the whole picture was breathtaking on screen. The images were like delicacies for the audience to savor in every shot. The story skips around in a seemingly abrupt fashion, but is woven together through progression. I think I'll have to see it again to grasp the connection between the first and last scenes, though. The whole film had an inkling of Lynchian flavor to it, especially with the usage of sexuality, violence, and some of the creative characters (like the ""Yellow Bastard"" -- something about him reminded me of Michael J. Anderson in Mulholland Drive). The wavering mental state of Dwight (Clive Owen) and Marv (Mickey Rourke) also brought back some Lynch themes.<br/><br/>I'll definitely have to see it again."
"julio_v27612","10","0","6","30 March 2005"," Absolutely awesome!
","Saw the preview screening last night and the review title says it all. Never have a seen a film that actually retains the feel and style of the original source. From the very first scene, you know that you're in a surreal place where anything can, and does, happen. The performances are tight and the storyline arcs wonderfully. The only thing you want from this film is more! Even though Willis is type-cast; it's perfect. Elijah Wood's performance is not only surprising but downright creepy. I expect that a lot of the tone of the film was because Frank Miller had a direct hand in its making. Couple that with Robert Rodriguez's craftsmanship and it's practically unstoppable.<br/><br/>Dark, nasty, gritty and mean, this film is not for the faint-of-heart. It is, however, one of the best made films I've seen in years. Those folks who raved over ""Saw"" will get blown away by this film. This is a standard for the new breed of film noir."
"malisp","10","0","3","26 March 2005"," Film Noir with a little comic book feel
","A good friend of mine had tickets for an advanced screening of Sin City and was nice enough to invite me along. I owe him big-time. As you've probably heard by now, the movie is based off of the ""graphic novel"" (read: comic book) by Frank Miller. I've read maybe 10 comic books in my lifetime, and this wasn't one of them, so I was a little skeptical going into the movie even after seeing the visually enticing previews. I had nothing to worry about. There were no cheesy shots that imitated a comic book page layout or mutant villains (which had worried me after seeing the yellow guy in the previews). All in all, it was well written with complex characters and an engaging plot, and had no one told me it was based off of a comic book, I would never have thought it on my own.<br/><br/>Visually, the film is a masterpiece. It seems more like Film Noir than any of the movies that created the genre. The blacks of the shadows are absolute, and some of the whites are so pure that they stand out completely from the shadows, even if the rest of the object can't been seen at all. And it's this uncompromising and drastic portrayal of chiaroscuro that creates such a visual feast. It feels five times darker than any film noir while stylistically hinting at the movie's comic book origins. Another visual aspect of the film is the splashes of color in this otherwise black & white film. I was concerned this might come off hokey, but it is done so well that after a while, I forgot some of the more prevalent ones were even there (much like watching a b&w movie and forgetting it's not in color). The splashes of color would force me to focus on an important character of one his/her characteristics, and then sneak out of my consciousness. Of course, there are some times when color is used to shock, but otherwise it seemed wonderfully subtle.<br/><br/>As for the plot, it's a throwback to the days of pulp fiction (50's detective magazines, not the movie with S. L. Jackson and Travolta). I'm a huge fan of the genre and that's probably why I ended up giving this movie 10 stars. There was at least one scene that seemed to have been ripped directly from one of Raymond Chadler's books. Other aspects of the plot seemed to take on a more modern detective story flair, like something from a John Sanford or Michael Connelly novel. However, unlike many of these books, which usually end up investigating an act of violence that has already happened, Sin City is almost non-stop violence from the beginning, setting a tone for the entire movie. And while the violence is certainly prevalent, it is by no means overbearing. In fact, I found myself anticipating many acts of violence and rooting them on. A few violent scenes even provoked laughter from the audience. And speaking of humour, this movie was surprisingly humorous, often allowing the audience a slight reprieve between tense scenes. Despite all the violence though, it really wasn't very bloody. When blood was called for it was certainly used, but many times times the blood wasn't even colored, only that pure splash of white.<br/><br/>Anyone who enjoys a good detective/crime/revenge story should definitely see this movie. Actually, I would even suggest Sin City to anyone who enjoys striking visuals and would like to experience a truly unique style which we rarely get see anymore. Seeing Sin City for the first time is probably a lot like seeing movies such as Metropolis, Star Wars, Who Framed Roger Rabbit, and The Matrix when they first came out. And, of course, any Tarantino (who was a ""guest director"" for Sin City, and it shows) fan can't miss this movie. Most importantly though, don't be scared off from seeing Sin City in the theater because you heard it was based off of a comic book. Because even though the story will hold up on your DVD player at home, the visual experience on a full-sized screen should not be missed."
