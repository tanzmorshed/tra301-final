","Terminator Salvation gets panned left and right.....but let me first say this is way more better then T3 and Genisys by miles.<br/><br/>Not only is it a serious terminator movie.....its more faithful to the first 2, yes it has plot holes and not die hard terminator violence but what do you expect when companies are trying to make everything PG13 for money.<br/><br/>This is the Terminator movie you get, to throwbacks to Guns n Rose you could be mine to a CGI arnie wreaking havoc, yes it could of been done better but some of it is actually really good, just accept and stop expecting the greatness of T2, that was cameron and this is MCG two different directors.<br/><br/>The acting is good, don't know what everyone is going on about with Bale being a weak connor when he is perfect for the role, yelchin plays a fantastic kyle reese and sam worthington is great as marcus.<br/><br/>Relax, watch and enjoy a good summer action movie with no expectations, the opening helicopter scene is a work of art.<br/><br/>TS - 7/10"
"frequenzangriff","8","39","44","8 September 2015"," A really good sci fi movie
","I've seen it three times - in the big screen (2009), somewhen in 2012, and now at 2015 (after seeing genesys) I also really don't understand all the negative comments about this film. I am a fan of the Terminator series (t1, t2 and TV show) and i really think this film stays true to the original idea and actually adds quite a bit to it.<br/><br/>I liked the robot models (mostly the little water bastards and the huge robot at petrol station), the HK's look great, and that t-600 is bloody scary and awesome (bulky, limited movement and a gatling gun).<br/><br/>I liked the whole concept of the movie a lot, and it showing the initial research work and human test subject and all, and showing the fight against machines after judgment day (i wish genesys would show more of this) And there is marcus...god, i loved this flawed terminator model! well, as a sci fi freak i enjoyed Terminator Salvation a lot"

","Terminator Salvation is a mess, one that has no real tension or stakes to its storyline. I respect that they wanted to tell a different story, but it just didn't feel like a Terminator film."
"MovieAddict2016","6","496","701","19 May 2009"," Competently made, but also self-defeating.
","Considering that he's part of the dreaded ""MTV Generation"" of filmmakers, McG is surprisingly old-school when it comes to his framing: no jumpy Michael Bay antics or hypercutting Paul Greengrass mimicries. He is a far more organic director, letting the action sequences play out naturally. It's his execution that's at fault: the action itself. He piles explosions on top of other explosions and machines slamming into other machines, backed by the deafening cues of Danny Elfman's score, and I'm pretty sure Christian Bale had a yelling stipulation written into his contract. Everything's loud, intense, bombastic. You can't accuse McG of copying Jim Cameron's first two flicks — or even Jonathan Mostow's goofy third — but you're left wishing he'd perfected his own style before tackling such an ambitious project and producing, as a result, a frustratingly passable action-thriller.<br/><br/>McG cites Cormac McCarthy's The Road as an influence on his movie, and it shows. The world is bleak and starved and seems to have a post-fallout hue cast over it. Yet somehow the female lead, Moon Bloodgood, always looks like she's just gotten done applying makeup and iron curling her hair. (Not to mention, based on her outfits, she must have found the only mall outlet that hadn't yet been raided by pillagers.)<br/><br/>Bloodgood is a great example of the movie's ill tendencies — sad to say, she personifies them. I've seen her interviewed and she's as likable as could be, but she's an awful actress, and her entire role could have been excluded from Terminator Salvation leaving in its absence a tightened film and less predictable subplot, which is this: the cyborg-who-doesn't-know-he's-a-cyborg, Marcus Wright (Sam Worthington), falls for her. And she falls for him. And like Sarah Connor at the end of T2, she is forced to confront the spiritual conundrum of what truly separates man from machine.<br/><br/>But here's the thing: isn't that such a cliché? If done well, it could be as touching as T2 was; if done poorly, it can be a disastrous reminder of Short Circuit 2. Unfortunately, McG hasn't a clue how to handle his characters' interactions, and so we get very heavy-handed intermissions featuring Worthington saying some pretty cringe-worthy stuff. One campfire sequence is so unintentionally funny that I truly felt sorry for McG, in the same way you'd feel compassion for a young boy naively attempting to, I don't know, shave or something. At first it's cute, like, Oh, look, he doesn't realize that he's too young to shave. Then it's like, Oh, crap, he just cut his neck.<br/><br/>But I'm under-selling the movie's positive attributes, which are the action sequences. Too loud, maybe, but a whole lot of fun. The special effects on the Terminators are solid, and McG throws in plenty of nods to the older films without all of them seeing too forced (we even find out how the adult Connor from T2 got his scar — a level of detail proving that McG really is a fanboy himself), and Anton Yelchin, who I despised as a precocious kid shrink in 2007's Charlie Bartlett, is fantastic in the role of Kyle Reese, effectively channeling Michael Biehn from the first movie.<br/><br/>Audiences will connect with Marcus because he represents the viewers. We're thrust into this new world just as suddenly as he is, and in his bewilderment and confusion, we find our parallel. With Avatar's release later this year, Worthington will most likely be the Next Big Thing, and is essentially - in this film, anyway - what Heath Ledger was to Christian Bale in The Dark Knight.<br/><br/>And so we arrive at Bale: he plays John Connor. But here's the thing about John Connor: he's really not that interesting. That's an obvious flaw, perhaps: if you woke up every morning knowing you were the saviour of the human species, would you be a fun guy to hang around with? Probably not. In that regard, Bale nails Connor: intense, passionate and dry without an ounce of self-reference or levity. He never steps back and winks at us, and even his brief dialogue retread (""I'll be back"") feels legitimate, spared of Arnie's corny delivery from T3. This guy means business. That's what you're left with, but without a compelling enough story, who really cares? Bale will be massacred by overzealous blog culture critics who've been waiting for months to crack jokes about his leaked on-set rant, but he extracts every ounce of potential from the character and - to that extent - gives a fantastic performance. The bottom line is that John Connor as a religious figure in the Terminator universe has no room for expansion, and unless McG were to fundamentally change the dynamics of the character, a post-Judgment Day Connor is not going to connect with audiences. That's precisely why Cameron never envisioned taking the series this far: the impending doom of Judgment Day in the original series always felt far more intimidating than the reality of it. The brief glimpse of nuclear holocaust in the first two movies was eerie and scary because of its fleeting nature; keeping in tune with his religious allegories, Judgment Day was to the Terminator universe what Revelations is to fundamentalists: that big, frightening end for humanity that we must all live in awareness of. Seeing it unfold kind of takes away the charm, you know? So although Terminator Salvation is somewhat competently made and an entertaining enough action spectacle, giving this much away just feels a bit self-defeating. What if the End of Days occurred tomorrow, Jesus revealed himself unto us all and the remaining human beings left on earth were forced into resistance camps? Would anyone still be reading the Bible?"
"smithjackson-44445","Null","40","51","4 December 2018"," Terminator Salvation is a great sequel to T1 and T2
","Wow, this is a decent film- I was thoroughly entertained and this despite going in with low expectations. McG manages a great color palette and the action sequences are awesome. Sure, this isn't as great as The Terminator or Terminator 2 but it is surely better than T3 and a lot better than the other works in the cannon. Both Bale and Worthington are fantastic. Go watch Terminator salvation now."
"enjoiskaterguy","6","389","576","31 May 2009"," Some nice action but where's the tone? Where's the mood? Where's the atmosphere?
","The atmosphere that James Cameron and Stan Winston had created for the first 2 films in the franchise is what really hit me and still does to this day. I think that was the key component along with consistency and approach that gave the Terminator film it's unique style and attractiveness. It's metallic-blue overlay, infused with creepy whines of music and heart pounding edge of your seat suspense was what really created this secondary reality if not for only an hour long. It made us have a connection to these characters. A sense of believability in what was really going on. But it was those elements that were able to harness the inner workings of this dark dreamland. In essence the first two Terminators were projected nightmares in a sense, as if you were running and running, but no how fast you ran, the shadowy figure on your toes just keeps closing in. THAT is what made those films so captivating.<br/><br/>Now these elements in one way or another were tried in this newest installment of the franchise. I see it as I've heard before as a ""hit and miss"" movie in which it got some key features to play out in the film, but lacked that essential tone T1 and T2 romantically portrayed.<br/><br/>I have talked in lengths with individuals on why this film didn't quite hit all of it's projected(we hope) targets and I haven't really heard a clear and analyzed answer. Some say it was the amount of sub-plots that were involved, the lack of plot, the empty character development, the slight cheesy factor, and or the overall weak story and unnecessary additions to the Terminator franchise. Although these all valid arguments to say the least and I would agree on them full heartily, I don't see it as the culprit of the problem here of why this film did not life up to it's expectations.<br/><br/>I think, like I said above in the first paragraph, that it was the direction the film was taken in perspective to it's overall tone and mood. God bless his soul, Stan Winston. For if he were alive I think we would have seen a more polished version of what we have now witnessed. I also think it was a bad part on McG for giving the O.K on the revised Terminator theme by veteran composer Danny Elfman. I don't know why in the hell the screened audiences gave the thumbs up on that one. Another issue of course is that most of the scenes were in broad day-light. I understand that McG wanted to get a different take on the war, but I don't think this was pulled off in any respects to what James Cameron had in mind for the war.(Shouldn't the sky be filled with pollution and dark particle manner from the nuclear explosions creating an ever-dark wasteland?) This was CRUCIAL and they blew it. I don't see why they didn't go with more night scenes. It is one of the strongest representative thematic elements portrayed in the Terminator 1 & 2.(I am not even going to mention T3 because of the ridiculous amount of mistakes made) <br/><br/>The Rating: A main point that needs to be addressed for sure is the film's PG-13 rating. Of course they did this to appeal to a larger demographic of movie-goers, but they did it in expense of the true grit and bones that T1 and T2 had. I don't see why a Terminator film should be even considered for a PG-13 rating. Anything lower than an ""R"" rating does not do the title justice. The series is called Terminator for a reason...They are killing machines. THAT'S IT. I think that this is one of the biggest insults to the die-hard community of Terminator fans everywhere.<br/><br/>There is no room for Mediocrity in trying to follow up after T2: Judgment Day. Lets hope and pray that us as an online community hold the next bunch of crazies accountable for their creative actions for the next installment of the franchise."
"xenazues","7","32","43","4 June 2018"," The 80's and the 90's aren't coming back.
","I have seen a lot of reviews on here, more than I usually read. And it is way too many 1's. This movie is no where near a one rating. I've been watching a lot of movies since I was a little kid. From cheesy 80's flicks, to straight to TV. This is no where near a 1. This movie sits at a 7 for me. Would have got an 8 but I'm super hard on the female acting in these new generation of movies.<br/><br/>This movie by now is 9 years old so nothing would be giving it away. But with that said Linda Hamilton in the first one was 19 years old. And she can act. Which is why 7 or 8 years later in Terminator 2 her acting was polished the movie was even better. It is not a secret if the female character can act you are going to have a good movie. The female acting in this movie was decent which is why it got a 7 from me.<br/><br/>But I can see why people gave this a one. The first Terminators were scary. The machine just kept going. You also had the awesome 80's music, along with the clothes. I mean seriously Sarah O conner was riding an 80's scoter and listening to head phones. And going to the club. Just a lot of vintage stuff in that movie which brought it back to the 80's. The 90's was even better in T2, crazy hair cuts, dirt bikes and the graphics in that at the time were unique. <br/><br/>But they did try to incorporate some of the old ideas. John Conner goes ""come with me if you want to live"", the motor cycle scene still is exciting as it was almost 30 years ago. The naked terminator. Normally during these remakes I get bored or fall asleep. It was action through the whole movie. I don't know if it was christian bale. Or who it was. But I felt entertained. <br/><br/>If people came here looking at this review thinking they are get a play by play of the movie. I'm not doing that with this one. You have to watch and please don't listen to these negative reviews. They want to live in the past on something that has already been done. <br/><br/>Once again don't try to watch this thinking this is going to be like the fist 2. It is not. Its just going to be great acting and simply a plot that action. Nothing over the top where its mind blowing. Expecting this movie to be like the first 1 where they were on to something new, and the second one where they had some super special effects is asking too much. It was well written movie. And its great to have all the Terminators. Cause I do."

","WARNING! I will ruin this movie for you<br/><br/>I've seen all of the Terminator movies (all in their respective days) have read most of the comic book adaptions and have snored my way through the recent T.V series. And yes. Some incarnations were obviously better than others (to me) But, this turd of a film could not be further from the mark. And when I actually bothered to look up ""McG""s body of work I can't say that I'm surprised. Gap commercials, music videos, Charlie's Angels... At what point did the financiers of this movie say ""wow, we have to get this guy to direct the movie"" But, I can't put all of the blame on one person. The entire creative staff has obviously gone to the Michael Bay school of film making...and failed. I only have 1000 word to work with...sooo...I shall list my gripes in point form. <br/><br/>1. Within 10 minutes of the title shot, this movie fired off one of THE BIGGEST Clichés IN WESTERN FILM. ""It's too quiet in here (dramatic pause) It's like they're waiting for us"" Seriously now! Is this the best writing that Hollywood can come up with? If this was an attempt at humour...it failed...just like the rest of this movie.<br/><br/>2. Giant Robots!!! Loud noises!!! Almost all of the battle sequences in this movie played out like a stylized ripoff of Transformers. There were big walking robots, big robot sound effects, big robot guns and aircraft, big robots riding the robot aircraft, motorcycle robots... They even had little stabby robots that swam around in the water. And they all looked like something out of a cheesy mecha flick. All glossy and pointy looking. These are not the cold, machined gun metal designs that set this series apart from all the others.<br/><br/>3. Chase scenes...chase scenes....followed by more chase scenes. #&#$ off with this already! How much time did these people fill with these blown out, CG'ed chase scenes? Foot chases, car chases and even air chases. ""How do we transition from our crappy battle scene to our feeble attempt at character development?"" Oh! I know!"" Yep...you guessed it...<br/><br/>4. Even more clichés... Yep...Just about all of them. I'll have to make sub-points for this. <br/><br/><ul><li>The irrelevant love interest cliché.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The conflicted double agent cliché.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The antagonist's fatal flaw cliché. ""Let's just leave all of our nuclear power cells laying on a big table. They'll be OK""</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The incompetent villain cliché. No, a hydraulically powered mechanical assassin would not simply shoot/crush/eviscerate it's victims. But, would merely toss them around, fire it's weapons erratically and then stand underneath precariously placed heavy objects, blast furnaces etc... </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The (pathetically mangled) hero's sacrifice cliché. ""Oh no! John Connor has been impaled through the chest with a ragged piece of metal! And, his heart is just about to fail! Here, take my perfectly good cyborg heart...that has just been crushed repeatedly with a giant metal casting....and then nearly punched out of my chest by another cyborg"" </li></ul><br/><br/>Need I go on?<br/><br/>This movie is big budget Hollywood hackery at it's best. And I still can't believe that it made it off of the script. I hope that the persons responsible for this mockery are ripped apart by wild dogs. <br/><br/>Thank you and good day"
"jora_dyn","7","363","582","21 May 2009"," Enjoyable ride, not quite there but lots of fun...
","I was actually rather surprised that this film was as enjoyable as it was. After reading several scathing reviews I was very worried going into this film. Overall I had a good time watching it.<br/><br/>Now I should preface this with the fact that I am a huge fan of the Terminator films/franchise. I think that overall the look was amazing, the action and CG were great and the acting was mostly good. I think the film suffered from not enough character development and I think that McG was on the right track, but needed a tighter script and story to work with. You can tell in the film that he is a fan of the first films... I definitely got a kick out of all the throw backs to the films. Not just the obvious ones like the music choices or one liners, but also subtle things like single handed shotgun cocking or single handed pipe blows, or the choice of settings and shots.<br/><br/>I have to say that Anton Yelchin as Kyle Reese did a fantastic job. He was probably my biggest worry in the film as Michael Biehn's, Kyle Reese is probably my favorite character in anything ever, so basically he had big shoes to fill. Well I didn't think it possible, but he actually made me love that character even more. So mad props to him. Again I think this was a very valiant effort by McG, he needs to work out a couple kinks for the next films, which I really he gets the green light on.<br/><br/>Basically there are a few of loopholes and inconsistencies which could bring you down if you linger too long on them, but if you are able to get past that it is definitely worth watching. But those are in all the films, even the second has some. (I'm not saying it's better than, so don't stone me!) In short I had a lot of fun at Terminator Salvation."
"roarrestored89","9","473","769","21 May 2009"," Not understanding the bad press at all.
","I just got back from seeing a midnight screening of the newest installment in The Terminator franchise, going into it with an open mind after witnessing the debacle that was T3 several years ago. Having said this, I honestly felt at though this movie did a fantastic job of translating the visions of the future that were set up in the original Terminator and T2 and fleshing out a feature-length film of them. While there indeed a few ""what in the hell were they thinking"" moments in the chase scenes, I felt that on the whole, the movie was a wonderful success, gripping me in a way that T3 never came close to. I truly hope prospective viewers give this film the shot that it rightly deserves and go into it with an open mind, and are able to just sit back and enjoy the ride...its a terrific one, trust me. Leaving the theater, I honestly felt as though this one gave the first two a run for their money as a film, as much as it pained me to say it. Truly a magnificent job breathing life into a series that could have very easy been done in once and for all with another terrible installment."
"giftofgodoflove","Null","151","235","23 May 2009"," I am completely let down . . .
","James Camerson made the Terminator franchise something special. As you were watching, you knew you were watching classics. You just have that feeling . . .<br/><br/>I've forgotten T3. Will TS resurrect the franchise? Nope.<br/><br/>First, who the heck is McG? No one knows. He directs TV series, and one other movie. For God's sake, give this movie to a talented director, someone with experience!!! Why was this given to McG? Why? <br/><br/>Second, the Script was awful. ""We may have won the battle, but we still have to win the war."" I think I heard that line from Power Rangers or Thunder Cats. Christian Bale must have called himself John Connor 30 times. Okay, he's John Connor. Got it! Bale must have called his army The Resistance 50 times. His inspiring speech over the radio was lackluster. People hover around the radio 'feeling' inspired because of that? I felt like I was watching Independence Day.<br/><br/>Third, I don't blame Bale for his performance. He did the best with what he had. His voice was annoying again. He had brief passion during some 'yelling parts'. That's it. But his whole personality had zero charisma.<br/><br/>Fourth, the NUMBER 1 rule for sequels is that they have to stand on their own: T2, Godfather 2, Empire Strikes Back, Aliens. You can't put a part in the sequel that 'hints' at the 1st movie - at least, overtly. Exp: In T3, after Arnold gets the clothes from the gay guy, he puts on 'star sunglasses', which 'hints' at T2, when he put on regular classes. No! No! No! Dumb! Stupid! Examples in TS: In T2, girl slaps Arnold in face, face cocks to the right, glasses break, and he looks back at her slowly. That scene was re-played 3 or 4 times in TS. Why!?!?! Further, Bale says, ""I'll be back."" Why?!!?! It's so self-conscious! It screams, ""Remember how Arnold is famous for saying this. Okay, let's make Bale say it too!"". Yuck! Kyle Reece says, ""Come with me if you want to live."" Why? Let's move on! It's 2009. Let's evolve. Stop with the T1/2 allusions already! <br/><br/>Fifth, Cameron's brief vision of 2029 in T2 was on to something. T-800's w/ guns on battlefield fighting soldiers on ground, gun battles, your occasional flying craft, etc . . . TS had 2 T-600's that I could count, flying crafts, and 1 huge T-1,000,000. Where's the freaking battles!?!? Something along the lines of the gun battles of ""Heat"", or the beach landings in ""Saving Private Ryan"". Something! Where's a There Will be Blood-like self-brooding or introspection by John Connor? It's like I was watching a video-game-turned-movie kind of movie, like Doom or Resident Evil. Awful!!!!!<br/><br/>Sixth, zero character development. I don't care about any characters. The movie doesn't develop them. They're wooden, cardboard cut-outs. In T1/2, we cared; that was part of why they're classics. TS is an action movie; that's it, with some name-dropping. What a shame. When you add 'no-character-development' w/ 'bad-script', you get 'lame-movie'. I felt like I was watching a movie made for TV on Spike or TnT.<br/><br/>Seventh, the movie was self-consciously PC, the independent-self-sufficient female character, not needing help from white male, pearlly white teeth, beautiful-clean-fluffy hair, breasts partially exposed, blah blah blah. It's like McG thought, ""What can I put in the movie that young mindless idiots will like, so it can make more money?"" It had a couple good action sequences. That's it. And that does not a good movie make. The set-design was also horrible. We had a couple cool 'waste-land' scenes, a couple cool 'abandoned city' shots that reminded me of 'I Am Legend', but some scenes looked like they were put together in my back yard with spray-painted card-board boxes, and a fake background.<br/><br/>Eighth, this movie should be R, not PG-13, period. It's a dark, in-your-face, gritty, bloody, graphic, adult-oriented, movie. Imagine Braveheart, Saving Private Ryan, and other classics if they were toned down to PG-13. Exactly. Unbelievable, that Hollywood is filled with such dunces or greed, just wanting to make a cash-cow. <br/><br/>The only character I was drawn to was Marcus. The CGI Arnold is gratuitous, and poorly executed. It just looks like a laughable cartoon. McG made this for 10-17 year olds.<br/><br/>Bottom line: I'm furious. The franchise has been gutted by amateur directing, producing, and writing.<br/><br/>It's a shame."
"Elswet","8","240","387","27 May 2009"," I liked it better than I expected, and was far less disappointed in comparison than other fans seem to have been.
","Wow, where do we start with a franchise film so rich in history...and so riddled with continuity errors? The time line problems began with the very first sequel, directed by Cameron himself, and perpetuated with T3. why then, is everyone so freaked by time line errors in T4? Depending on which line to which you subscribe, T4 still deviates vastly from BOTH sequels and begins a new alternative reality spin all its own.<br/><br/>And then there was the highly publicized expletive-filled Bale rant broadcast over and over and over ad nauseum. Upon seeing the film, I can better understand why that happened...this is a GRITTY film, full of angst and dancing testosterone. As ""worked up"" as Bale must have had to have been in order to pull off these angst-filled scenes (one after the other after the next), he exhibited amazing control in not HITTING the guy who blew the scene for him. I'm no longer upset or offended by his diatribe.<br/><br/>That brings us to the movie. Well, yes, there are problems with it, and many state that this film brings little to the franchise history and instead contributes to the growing list of errors and problems with the franchise, but I have to disagree.<br/><br/>This work, for me, demonstrates an intent to give us millions of machines marching en masse on human survivors in the attempt to quell a birthrate upsurge of the pestilence which has somehow managed to take control of its world...Mankind. The promise for something better is not only present due to how little this movie actually contributes, but by the actions and deeds therein.<br/><br/>There are several contrivances, and truthfully they were rewriting the script as it was being filmed due to Bale's demands, but all in all (and all things considered), this is an enjoyable film that not only is better on second viewing, but manages to ingratiate itself into the library of Terminator franchise films (or will when it's out on DVD in an unrated, extended director's cut edition, that is).<br/><br/>I liked it better than I expected, and was far less disappointed in comparison than I was with the Star Trek reboot.<br/><br/>It rates a 7.8/10 from...<br/><br/>the Fiend :."
"Critomaton","1","225","362","25 May 2009"," Definitely nothing worth yelling at Shane Hurlbut over.
","Alternate titles for this review: <br/><br/>1) A great sequel... to some other movie franchise.<br/><br/>2) The new terminator has a heart. The movie doesn't.<br/><br/>3) Go in expecting to be disappointed. You'll still be disappointed.<br/><br/>Wow, was this bad. <br/><br/>I stopped caring about anything that happened in this movie about 1 hour and 10 minutes in. I guess it was the second Huey helicopter crash with John Connor as both pilot and sole passenger that did it for me (it seems the U.S. army hasn't surplused any twin-engined Hueys yet, because Hollywood is still flying leftovers from ""Apocalypse Now"", even in the future).<br/><br/>I also zoned out during the drawn-out battle with the Schwarzenator near the end, because I really didn't care about John Connor (or his cute, perky wife, though she was never in danger the entire movie - another dramatic mistake).<br/><br/>This movie fails miserably in both aspects where the new Star Trek film shines: staying true to the original while making the new characterizations and situations compelling on their own merit.<br/><br/>Even Sarah Connor's recorded voice didn't sound right. I'm pretty sure it was neither Linda Hamilton nor Lena Headey - either one would have been better. And while this movie needed to have a big-name celebrity like Christian Bale to have a chance at success without Ah-nold in the main role, it couldn't have been any worse if Nick Stahl and Claire Danes had been brought back. In fact, Thomas Dekker would have been more interesting to watch.<br/><br/>I cared more about the people who got snatched up by the Martians in Steven Spielberg's ""War of the Worlds"" than I did about anybody in this flick. There was zero character development. The girl who's a combination of Newt from ""Aliens"" and the Feral Kid from ""The Road Warrior"" managed to be annoying without saying a word but, like Jaden Smith in ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"", you can't blame her for it, only the script non-writers.<br/><br/>This film is practically shot in monochrome, except for the flames. We get it. To quote George Costanza: ""When you're bleak, you're bleak"".<br/><br/>This movie reminded me of lots of other movies: ""The Road Warrior"", ""Aliens"", ""Transformers"", and even ""Resident Evil: Extinction"". Just not ""The Terminator"".<br/><br/>Yeah, maybe it doesn't seem fair to give Star Trek's time-travel pretzel plot a pass and nitpick ""Terminator Salvation"" but I mean, there were two huge plot holes in this one that just plain insulted the whole series storyline: <br/><br/>1) SkyNet went through this complicated plot to lure John Connor in with its infiltrator, instead of just killing him with the infiltrator. Ditto with Kyle Reese. It made absolutely no sense, and that's even *without* any time travel. <br/><br/>2) For some reason, John Connor was (a) unable to trust a terminator even though he found out in part 2 that they can be trusted if programmed correctly and (b) totally stunned to find out that a terminator had flesh and blood and organs, even though that's the first type he ever encountered. What's that all about? Oh, was it supposed to be a big deal that the terminator didn't know it was a terminator? Like that's really hard to program... (and can you say ""Total Recall""?). <br/><br/>Then there's the whole confusion/inconsistency about exactly what type of damage will or won't stop a terminator.<br/><br/>The movie tries really hard to create a sense of urgency with the rescue of the prisoners from SkyNet headquarters. It just doesn't work.<br/><br/>OK, so Sam Worthington's and Anton Yelchin's performances aren't as wooden (or metallic) as those of the other actors. This minor fact alone does not a summer blockbuster (or a worthy sequel) make.<br/><br/>I kept looking for some big, intense, dramatic scene that could have possibly made Christian Bale go ballistic on the director of photography. I must have missed it, and I won't be watching this turkey again to try and find it. <br/><br/>""Terminator Salvation"" fails miserably as a Terminator sequel. As a standalone, post-apocalyptic sci-fi vision it doesn't really fare much better."
"michaelRokeefe","8","14","18","31 March 2017"," John Connor, its up to you!
","Gritty installment four of the Terminator series. It is post-apocalyptic 2018 and John Connor (Christian Bale) is called on to lead the resistance against a dominating militaristic world of robots. Thought provoking elements help overlook some story line weakness. Altogether very entertaining and well directed. Terminator fans and even those who know very little of the series' backstory will enjoy this action-packed film.<br/><br/>Bale is fantastic as usual, but Sam Worthington is almost the scene robber here. Intense science fiction violence and action. Special effects are top notch. Some powerful sounds from Guns N' Roses and Alice In Chains. The cast is versatile and includes: Michael Ironside, Moon Bloodgood, Helena Bonham Carter, Anton Yelchin, Bryce Dallas Howard, Jadagrace and Victor Ho."

","I was somewhat hesitant to watch this movie. I didn't want it to be too dark and bleak and depressing. I mean, it was somewhat dark, but there was hope at the end. It's not a mindless action movie. It's definitely an action movie - but a good story I thought. Very entertaining! The story was well done. The characters were great - especially Marcus. You felt what he felt. I think this movie deserves higher than a 6.9 - it's current rating (as of 12-9-09). If you're a fan of Terminator and T-2 - then see this. I did see T3 but was not impressed w/ it and cannot remember much about it (when something doesn't leave an impression, it's usually not that good) - in my humble opinion. I dunno - maybe I need to see it again. I really like Marcus in this movie. I won't give anything away - no spoiler here. Just watch this - you should like it. :-)"
"rnilsen","1","110","181","25 May 2009"," The destruction of a great franchise
","This is one of the worst movies of all time. Not bad in a Plan Nine from Outerspace kind of way. No much worse. I have only once before ever felt so cheated and that was watching Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull last year. Cheated because of all the talent that could have made a GREAT movies and instead just cashed in big paychecks.<br/><br/>What makes this so bad is the destruction of a franchise through lazy writing and directing. Does anyone put effort into a script anymore or care about logic???? If the studio had enlisted any movie fan and given them a chance to read the script before this turkey was made, plot holes as large as a Mack truck could have been closed. Instead the Studio and Director relied totally on special effects to move this dog along. <br/><br/>Wher can I start? Well, here are a couple of the biggest problems:<br/><br/>1) Why does Skynet not just kill Kyle Reese????? He is their number one target, they capture him and instead of killing him, they just imprison him???? If they kill him then John Connor dies. Spock would throw up from this lack of logic. 2)What is Helena Bonham Carter's motivation in the beginning of the movie? She does not know at this time in history that Skynet will become self aware. How can she be involved in creating an infiltration machine without pre-knowledge of what will happen in the future? 3) The movie barely advances in the Terminator story. It is just a long television episode, the plot does not move along whatsoever. Perhaps they can just re-start the franchise and call this whole movie a bad dream like the ending of Dallas? 4) The acting is terrible, especially Christian Bale. He has one emotion and it is the same as he exhibited in that leaked internet tape earlier this year. Arnold's CGI performance is Oscar worthy in comparison. 5) Yes this is just a movie but in Sci-fi, it is important to follow the continuity and rules created in each films particular universe. A movie cannot take the lazy route and just makes things up when boxed into a corner. Here, there is a huge exposition scene near the end on a giant video screen with Helena Bonham Carter. Why does Skynet have a big video room to begin with? Ugh.<br/><br/>Studio's exist to make money, and I suppose this movie will turn a profit. However, from a long term perspective this movie has diminished the value of the overall franchise and potential of any future films."
"markfunston","1","245","424","22 May 2009"," Terrible
","I really have a hard time believing that ANYONE enjoyed this movie. This movie could have been so great. It could have been amazing. It could have been the best Terminator yet. But it wasn't. It wasn't even close. The story was terrible. There wasn't enough action. This was supposed to be a war, but there were no full scale war scenes. Christian Bale was just as stiff as John Conner as he was as Batman (cheesy voice, no personality).<br/><br/>The movie did start okay. I thought it might go in a good direction, but then stupid things started happening. First of all they spent the first hour of the movie acting like Marcus is a person just to have the major revelation that he is actually a machine - but wait, we already knew that from all of the trailers out there, so we just spend the first hour of the movie saying to ourselves ""why are they still acting like he's human""???? Then we do actually have a good action scene with the large terminators and the motorcycle terminators, but then another stupid thing happens. When Marcus is captured and Blair breaks him out, the entire resistance can't even catch him or kill him in their own home base!!! How could they possibly win a war against the machines when they can't even kill one in their own home???? It keeps going down from there. John conner sneaks in to the Skynet home base (very easily). Then there is a terribly boring fight scene that I swear they copied directly from the first two films. Then John plants a detonator on the pile of nuclear power cells that just happened to be sitting around and on his way out he blows the whole place up. If it were really that easy to walk in to Skynet and blow up a pile of power cells, why didn't they do that years ago. TERRIBLE.<br/><br/>And just when I thought the movie couldn't possibly get any worse... it does. John injured his heart reenacting the fight scene from the first Terminator movie, so Marcus (the machine with a heart) gives John his heart. Awwww, what a sacrifice. I guess Marcus really was human. TERRIBLE.<br/><br/>And then they had the nerve to end the stupid movie with John giving one of his terrible speeches leading right into the next movie. I really really really hope that if they do make another movie that someone else writes it, stars in it, produces it, and directs it.<br/><br/>If this weren't a Terminator movie, I would have given it 3 stars for being so bad, but since it destroyed so much potential I couldn't give it any more that 1 star. TERRIBLE. I'm totally disappointed."
"siderite","7","141","240","17 July 2009"," This was actually a decent film!
","Enough with the copycat comments! Everybody is so keen to criticize this film, while completely ignoring its good parts. Was there some plot weirdness? Well, yeah, we are talking humans winning versus machines here. But most of it was decent.<br/><br/>In this film you get to see more machine types, more character ambivalence (do you even remember the first Terminator? it was machine fascism!), more hints to the previous movies and, most of all, hints of the direction of the Terminator concept. I don't want to spoil it for you, but you must be blind not to see it is a good thing.<br/><br/>Other good things in this movie: Moon Bloodgood, the Oh-girl; Michael Ironside, just as fun as ever, even if having some scenes. And there is Sam Worthington, who is actually the main character and more like Help from BSG, but twice as cool, NOT Christian Bale aka John Connor.<br/><br/>I am surprised to see that both Terminator the series and the new Terminator are bringing some modernism to the old age concept of machine war. They are obviously not without flaw, but considering the alternatives and, even more, my expectations, I would say that saying this film was bad must be just some fashionable thing to say right now.<br/><br/>Bottom line: I liked it!"
"quikbdr720","4","173","301","21 May 2009"," Terminator Salvation...barely salvageable
","Hmm...Hmm...Hmm...ho hum dee. Terminator- 1984, we see a ground-breaking film with never before seen special effects and a story that was 10 years ahead of its time, Judgement Day- 1992, We see more groundbreaking film-making, a stellar cast, and one of the most iconic performances ever (GO ARNIE!!!), Rise of the Machines- 2003, not bad, especially considering that after T-2, that was it for Cameron, he was done, moving on to new things, new writers, new director, great rewritten history of Skynet reemerging after we all thought it was TERMINATED. And the return of Arnie. So...after about a year of hype (for myself especially, I am as the equivalent of a Trekkie in the Terminator universe), 2009, Terminator Salvation...Not groundbreaking, but with Christian Bale, Sam Worthington, Moon Bloodgood, McG, Seems like a damn good collection of actors and up and coming director right?? Well...here we go...<br/><br/>First off, the film kicks off in the right gear, I seriously felt like I was watching a live action version of Fallout 3, post apocalyptic world depicted with great detail, some very good action scenes (and acting) early on, All seems to go well, Marcus Wright (Worthington) is introduced very well, so is Kyle Reese (Yelchin, Star Trek), and the Terminator world we saw so little of in T1 & T2 was all there.<br/><br/>Buuuuut then what happens I can't even begin to try to figure it out. I swear there were 3 or 4 great ideas put into play by McG, but, when you start an idea, develop it, that just didn't happen, the whole film felt like it was jumping from one thing to another with very little explanation.<br/><br/>Character development: where was it??? John Connor was the focal point in T2 & T3, staying alive, fighting...Well, even Christian Bale (amazing actor, by far one of today's best) couldn't deliver, but it wasn't his fault, He has what barely constituted as a supporting role, the whole film was revolved around who Marcus Wright was, but even that wasn't covered very well. Honestly, it got old hearing Bale scream and Worthington howl toward the sky. And even Bloodgood and Bryce Dallas Howard who played Kate Connor had little screen time and no development what so ever.<br/><br/>Action: chock full of it, any thought or creativity put in it? NO, N-O. There were a totally of maybe 3 exciting moments in the whole film, I will not spoil them, because honestly, if this was just a post apocalypse action yarn, it was awesome, but its TERMINATOR, not at one point was there any new ideas put in any of the scenes, it felt like McG cheaply ripped off the previous 3 films (but with way more NOTICEABLE CGI), the major problem with Hollywood today, TOO MUCH CGI, NO PLOT DEVELOPMENT, and this film is no different.<br/><br/>I and the theater cheered with one scene...the entrance of...well, no need to guess here. Was also about the only other homage to the originals (the truck chase from the trailer is excellent as well).<br/><br/>ACTION FILM 6/10 <br/><br/>TERMINATOR FILM 3/10, If there is going to be another one, Cameron needs to intervene and tell HIS look on the future war, and bring that someone back into the franchise (he won't be Governor forever!) <br/><br/>This may be a discouraging review, but remember, its all in what you like. i love action movies, but with Terminator, you need plot too. Go see it and make your own assumptions, this is just mine, I'm sure some will love it, but it took Terminator in the direction Attack of the Clones took Star Wars"

","TS is a film that will wow your eyes and ears. It will be a standard for demonstrating the latest high-end home theater systems for several years. Do not, however, go to this film to stimulate the imagination. The plot has many holes patched with barely-there plot devices. I'm reminded of the film Thank You For Smoking when the character Jeff Mengall spoke of Hollywood plot holes getting filled with lines like ""Thank God we invented the... you know, whatever device."" In previous Terminator films, you could always assume that sending anything back in time took a lot of energy and resources - that's why you could accept that there was only one Terminator instead of 2+ working together. In this film, we are made to believe that fighting Skynet is like out-maneuvering a herd of angry elephants with laser beams on their heads.<br/><br/>In all, I gave this film a 7 because it does what a good futuristic action film should do: wows the eyes and ears.

Plot was thin, and cheesy in spots (heart transplant comes to mind).<br/><br/>But, really, was it deserving of all this hate from fans blinded by sentimentality to the holes in the first two films? No.<br/><br/>Some misconceptions I've seen again and again in comments here: <br/><br/>* The war scenes in the earlier films were in the dark because of the primitive cinematic FX of the time. Fans seem to think that Terminator Salvation should have been in the dark the whole time, which is silly. The sun does come up in the morning.<br/><br/>* Skulls? Skulls? No there shouldn't be skulls everywhere on the ground. There were way too many on the ground in the earlier movies, very unrealistic.<br/><br/>* Kyle Reese. Skynet seemed to realize he was important (why I don't know). Skynet didn't know that he was Connor's father, so there was no reason to kill him once in custody.<br/><br/>* Lots of confusion about Terminator and various robot models. This movie takes place about a decade before the future war events. Many reviewers seem to miss this detail.<br/><br/>I'd actually rate TS about a 6 or 7 out of 10, but I need to cancel out some low votes by hysterical fans. Good, but not great."

"gadwin1929","1","91","155","5 June 2009"," Can't believe some people give this movie 8+ out of 10. T4 was garbage
","As a terminator fan who was hoping for a revival of the franchise, what a letdown this movie was. Before going in depth about the movie, let's take a look at how this mess was made:<br/><br/>Mistake #1) Newbie producers Derek Anderson and Victor Kubicek acquire the rights to the Terminator franchise. These two goons only have experience producing a low budget flick called ""Cook-Off"" to their credit and are absolute newcomers to the industry.<br/><br/>Mistake #2) Derek Anderson and Victor Kubicek, not surprisingly as newbies, choose McG as the director. LOL, McG, the director of Charlies Angels! FFS, you can see where the movie is going now ...<br/><br/>Mistake #3) The script is written and McG tries to cast Christian Bale as Marcus. Christian Bale says he wants to play John Connor and not Marcus. Unfortunately, John Connor has a 3 minute appearance in the original script and is not a significant character. At this point, the producers and McG have two viable options:<br/><br/><ul><li>Ditch the original script with Marcus and write a new one from scratch that explores John Connor's character in depth, if time allows.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Say NO to Christian Bale, and stick with the original script if they are on a deadline. Memo to Derek Anderson, Victor Kubicek, and McG: THE TERMINATOR FRANCHISE CAN SELL ITSELF WITHOUT Christian BALE - STAR TREK PROVES THAT A BUNCH OF NO NAMES CAN SELL A MOVIE IF IT IS MADE WELL.</li></ul><br/><br/>Mistake #4) Oh my gosh! They decide to cast Christian Bale as John Connor and then go on to mangle the script to give John Connor a larger role. The script goes through various hands, and even Jonathan Nolan is brought in to save the script but there is little he can do. They are even trying to rewrite the script on set. FFS, you know a movie is in trouble if they are doing major rewrites of the script on set.<br/><br/>Now that we know how the movie was made, here is my review: This movie has great special effects and action sequences. The problem is, it has no character development, the viewers could give a sh*t about the characters, and the story is garbage. In other words, it's the polar opposite of T2. T3 had lots of plot holes, but while T3 was letdown from T2, at least T3 attempted to give more attention to the characters.<br/><br/>If all you want is mindless action and special effects, this could be a passable movie for you. If you are a true Terminator fan and wanted a movie that would delve into characters, where action is secondary to the story (ie. T2), this is not the movie for you.<br/><br/>Since this movie cost $200 million to produce and so far, the box office receipts are $90 million, there are two possibilities: a) The Terminator Franchise has ended on the big screen. That would be sad but what can you expect with Derek Anderson, Victor Kubicek, and McG at the helm? b) Derek Anderson and Victor Kubicek never find the funding for T5 and are forced to sell it to a studio that is capable of making good decisions to make T5 (ie. start by picking a better director other than McG and find good writers).<br/><br/>I surely hope it's the latter."
"Flagrant-Baronessa","3","454","840","12 June 2009"," A sad casualty of what's mistakenly deemed bankable today.
","Yikes. This is definitely not the future my mother warned me about. This future is populated by cute kids, blood-free deaths, supermodels with perfect teeth and goofball terminators that shoot themselves in the foot. It is set in a sun-kissed Michael Bay desert landscape with high-tech military equipment and not the dirty sewers we saw in T1. Either Kyle Reese was laying it on real thick to get in Sarah Connor's pants, or McG et al were simply incapable of delivering the dark, post-apocalyptic future setting that they kept harping on about honoring before release.<br/><br/>This is no doubt a casualty of the scarlet letter that is the PG-13 rating, oft denied by the production while they dropped subtle hints along the way such as toy deals, Pizza Hut endorsements and McG noting how the PG-13 The Dark Knight was ""made without compromise"". In reality the rating was a fait accompli the moment they green-lit a $200M production. The implications of the rating are not just sacrifices to language, blood & gore or in the inclusion of a sidekick kid to instill the family friend image. It's worse. Now the Transformers audience is a major demographic for TS, and it translates in the light-hearted, gadgety nature of the movie, and obviously in its Harvester design (who deploys mototerminators from its kneecaps).<br/><br/>But quite honestly, massive mythology discrepancies aside, there is simply far too many wrist-slashingly bad/expository lines and heavy-handed metaphors in the script for this to even work as a standalone movie (thanks, Haggis). To its credit, much of the action is kinetically captured in a timely shaky-cam fashion. Lord knows I'm no McG fan (he's a snake-oil salesman) but I feel the major culprit truly is the script which spells everything out for the viewer with voiceovers and facepalm exposition. I'm sorry the writers were not able to give McG, at the very least, the kind of mindless action flick he was surely able to direct in a competent if forgettable manner. <br/><br/>Whereas acting is concerned Christian Bale shows up for 35-40 minutes looking real angry at the world and at being involved in this project, it is in fact Sam Worthington who is a breakout star, and such an effortless tough guy that you can feel the bass reverberate in your body when he throws a punch. Think of how hardass he could be in the right R-rated setting. I'm getting chills just thinking about it. Everything else reeks of an empty cash-in sequel with neither knowledge nor respect for the source material, vaguely ""justified"" by tagging on ""this isn't the future my mother warned me about"". No, McG, it most certainly is not.<br/><br/>Whatever. Pages could be spent arriving at the conclusion that this movie is, quite simply, abysmal. I'm giving it a 3 out of 10 based on Yelchin, Worthington and effort on the action side of things."
"jedibearvt","10","44","71","4 July 2009"," Made by some fans for the fans...
","I really expected a bad movie considering it was ""Charlie's Angels"" McG at the helm, but it actually had the same ""B"" movie feeling the other three had...I got the same great vibe from it I got from some '70s flicks like ""Soylent Green"" or ""Omega Man""...intense stories augmented bu action and some interesting characters that don't necessarily need a lot of screen time to make their marks in the story.<br/><br/>The production was outstanding...this will a great demo disc on BR, especially with the sound design...very layered and intense. The special effects were great and everything from sets to make-up to costumes and photography was a step up from the earlier films, giving it an epic feel. It has a gritty look to the action that suits the setting and story perfectly. The physical action were really well done...it was refreshing to see some very convincing integration of the practical sets along with the now-standard CG stuff that blended well together and again, added an intense realism to the movie without being over the top. Stand-outs include the sensational ""Harvester"" chase scene and some ""throwaway"" moments like the HK air patrolling the streets of LA and toppling a building in it's wake and Connor jumping into the waves to meet the Resistance Leadership....cool, quick stuff that wasn't lingered on, but looked great.<br/><br/>Another surprise here is the choice of Danny Elfman, and his score sounds quite good...he gives the music a more traditional orchestral sound opposed to the over-use of synthesizers that many action films rely on these days. It was cool to hear Fidel's main motif pop in once in a while at just the right times.<br/><br/>Now the cast...as mentioned by many other reviews, this is definitely Sam Worthington's show...the story invests a lot of time in Marcus' journey through the film an it helps that Worthington does a really good job with his physical performance (especially with those little nods to Arnold's ""stillness"" along the way) and he comes across well acting-wise too. I found his struggle with what he really was provided the most poignant moments in the movie...a man trapped in a new existence as a Terminator, fighting to stay connected with his flawed humanity and looking for some kind of redemption for his own past and ending up providing a ""salvation"" for the resistance and it's new leader....cool stuff and an interesting twist on the whole ""Terminator"" story.<br/><br/>Bale was a supporting character compared to Marcus. Bale's John Conner seemed a little one-note with his performance throughout the film. There were some cool moments with him though, like when he pops on that GnR tune before capturing the MotoTerminator that brought back memories of the Connor character's motorbike stunts in T2. I also liked that it was pretty clear that not everyone in the resistance (most notably the higher-ups) though he was ""all that"", but the grunts in the trenches did...gave him an everyman appeal that was pretty cool. His best moments though, were the quiet ones...listening to his mother's voice for what must have been the umpteenth time to try and gain guidance and insight into the situations he found himself in...I thought that really illustrated just how much he really depended on that and how, by the end of the movie, he had to come out from his mother's shadow and come up with his own plan of action...his interactions with Marcus have altered his game and Bale did take us through that process...<br/><br/>Another show-stealer was Anton Yelchin as Kyle Reese...he is almost literally channeling Michael Biehn (right down to talking through clenched teeth) as the young resistance fighter Reese. He really brought across the idea of a young man looking for someone or something to follow...and his interaction with Marcus really brought that out and Yelchin just nailed it.<br/><br/>Both of the female characters are a little short-shifted here, but both Howard and Bloodgood do a good job in the brief scenes they have. Neither come across as simple damsels-in-distress, rather it's plain to see that they both play important parts in the resistance.<br/><br/>Like the recent ""Star Trek"" picture, this one had a lot of visual nods (and some obvious lines) to the earlier films, from the cool opening credits looking similar to the ones the first film to a lot of physical gags from other movies as well, especially with Marcus. The action sequences were well-staged and packed some punch. And yes, the Arnold cameo featured some excellent work from ILM...very well integrated both visually and in the story....very cool.<br/><br/>The ending? The ""leaked"" one of having Connor killed and coming back as a Terminator might have been shocking, but ultimately it would have rendered the entire saga pointless. The current ending works much better in giving his character some dramatic pause as he goes on in how the war with Skynet is fought...the sacrifice of Marcus alters the future Connor has been expecting to unfold because of the messages from his mother...and now, the future is unknown and he has to lead the resistance based on his own judgment instead of the ""road map"" laid out by those recordings. <br/><br/>The main thing that really shines though in this movie for me is that it really looks like an effort by folks that really cared about the Terminator saga and wanted to do a great job. As with any of these ""franchise"" movies, there are always fans who disagree with the approach taken with the film or story elements or casting choices or whatever. But it works great for me...I hope this movie finds a big, receptive audience on DVD and Blu-Ray..."

The director ""McG""'s notion of a plot can be summed up in one name, ""John Connor."" Oh wait, I forgot - there is a twist. (Don't worry about spoilers - - I couldn't possibly spoil this for you, and I don't mean that in a cheeky way. I literally mean that it is a physical impossibility for something without a plot to be spoiled. So read on. The twist is ""Kyle Reese."" Just throw in another iconic sounding character name with which an awestruck silence is generated every time its mentioned, and there you have it: the totality of this movie's ""plot"". (Don't ask me for an explanation: the movie offers none.) <br/><br/>And just as bad as ""no plot"" is the excruciatingly unfortunate realization that the setting - nearly a decade in the future (2018) - has zero visionary qualities, and I have to point out here that it ain't for any potentially noble reason as having accurately predicted that not much will change in 9 years. No. It's because they filmed this with what must have been McG's and crew's own jeeps and equipment - throw some military cameo netting and things bought for cheap at your local army surplus store, and you have ""Terminator: Salvation"". When all the dust settles - - you sit there blinking in astonishment that there really wasn't one damn worthy thing about this movie - no awesome future setting and no fully realized ""terminator army""; just a few badly strewn together props with stale cheesy dialog thrown in. <br/><br/>But the movie did have some thought put into it, I guess. There is the token ragamuffin 9 year old girl with the nappy hair (check); her charming teenage companion with the mystery persona (check); and their god -given ability to pop out of nowhere with a convenient remote mine-trigger device to blow up titanic renegade Terminaters at a moment's notice (check). <br/><br/>This movie is far less than the sum of it's assembled parts - assembled entirely from every genre movie that came before it. I kid you not: if you were to painstakingly eliminate each and every scene and reference to a previous movie (Mad Max, Road Warrior, Terminators, etc) you would be left with NOTHING. It is that unoriginal. <br/><br/>So here's the deal. I've warned you not to waste your time and money and consciousness seeing this, and I meant it from the bottom of my heart. Seeing as how I happen to know that this is a ""special"" installment or continuation of a franchise that means a lot to us - I don't expect you to take my word for it. I know how it is. You want to find out for yourself; hell, you need to. So let's make a deal. <br/><br/>Halfway through the movie, the only thought running through my head was ""I should lead a revolt of audience members to the box office demanding our money back"". God do I ever wish I had at least tried. To do so - I would naturally have had to begin hurling obscenities at the screen, and I didn't because, well I didn't want to ruin the possibility that others might be, cough, enjoying themselves *wince*. Do I ever regret it, now. <br/><br/>When the ultimate slap to the face arrives (the end credits) -- you too will wish YOU had been the leader of such a noble revolt. So NOW you have the opportunity handed to you on a silver platter. I beseech thee all -- someone must take the responsibility to just yell out midway through this cinematic turd ""THIS SUX!"" with their fist in the air, and I can't imagine no one else in the theater agreeing or muttering their sympathetic consent. TAKE the opportunity to leap to your feet and look wildly around you. FIND the people frozen in their seats with eyes glazed over - decent people like you and me who have obviously INVESTED their hope, high expectations, valuable time, and hard-earned money - SNAP them awake to the realization that WE DON'T DESERVE THIS CRAP from Hollywood! Shout out dramatically ""LET'S GO GET OUR MONEY BACK, PEOPLE!"" and lead their way out of that theater and to the front lobby. <br/><br/>I want to read about it in the papers, how good people in several mid-western states ROSE UP and DEMANDED their money back. Because if we all just sit there like sheep stunned into submission - then we deserve yet another installment of prefabricated plasticity shoved down our throats. Let this be a lesson to all who would blunder into a theater to see a movie by someone named ""McG"". If its zero nutrition fast food fake movie franchise that you want - then you know where to line up. <br/><br/>TERMINATER: SALVATION opened in theaters nationwide Thursday, May 21st."

","I was stunned at how bad this movie is. I don't think I've ever seen a performance where Bale mails it in but I don't blame him. The story is beyond remedial. There's no suspense, no emotion, no plot and no point. The only reason this movie seems to have for being is that it looks cool. If you like mindless action then I guess you'll like this but what made the first 2 films great was the story (let's not kid ourselves, that's what makes any film great). It had suspense, characters that you cared about and most of all INTELLIGENCE and HEART. This one is so freaking obvious it's astonishing. To have these resources available to you and screw it up so monumentally...<br/><br/>Maybe I should take a crack at writing a screenplay. I couldn't do any worse than this."

","Before viewing the film ""Terminator:Salvation"", there are a few things that you need to take into consideration(especially big fans). One of them being that this may be considered the fourth in the franchise, but its really its own movie. This movie has been bad mouthed from day one. It seems that so many films produced today are remakes, based off books, or taken from older franchises. So why does this one take more of the cake than others. I saw this movie in theaters and enjoyed it very much, and yes I am a fan of the series. McG deserves much more credit than what he got. This is not the best and not the worst, it is what it is. A fun, load, and rip roaring flick.P.S- You want bad, go watch the Twilight series.

","Christian Bale has proved that he is a fantastic actor. For me, this was just a paycheck movie for him. A very mechanical performance, in some scenes it seemed he never lets go of his Batman character. The movie itself was entertaining for the most part, but lacked the suspense that the first two Terminator films had. A quality that James Cameron possesses as a director that has been lost in the last two films. The screenwriters for Salvation can't decide who the main character is and what the main plot of the film is. Hoping that Salvation would revive the Terminator franchise, I was left with a bad taste in my mouth once again. It was a loud action film with no substance. Better luck next time."

","Wow, this is a decent film- I was thoroughly entertained and this despite going in with low expectations. McG manages a great color palette and the action sequences are awesome. Sure, this isn't as great as The Terminator or Terminator 2 but it is surely better than T3 and a lot better than the other works in the cannon. Both Bale and Worthington are fantastic.

","First, let me start off by saying if you go in expecting something as good as T2, you'd be making a mistake. However, this movie is definitely better than T3. It's a decent action flick that i found fun to watch. However, I didn't like the fact that Christian Bale used his ""batman"" voice in this movie, I thought the movie could've done without that. Another thing is that this movie has a little bit more of a focus on another character rather than John Connor, but fear not, John Connor does have a decent amount of screen time in the movie.<br/><br/>Overall, your not missing anything if you miss it at the movies, it'll do just fine on DVD and Blu-Ray"
"helmutty","7","71","128","30 May 2009"," Not great but massively entertaining.
","I have watched the terminator series, the movies are quite good. Terminator Salvation is the fourth in the series. One thing that disappoints is that there is no main terminator that goes killing humans like in Terminator 2. MCG, the director, did a great job especially creating the gritty and tough world. MCG proves that he can go from comedic action with stunts to loud whizz-bang and gritty action. But his story pretty much stays the same. His movies have always been a mindless thrill ride. That is Terminator Salvation.<br/><br/>The story: It is the year 2018. John Connor has grown up to a bat-man-like with tough voice. He is serious and leads a team to destroy terminators and Skynet. There is one mysterious guy named Marcus who does not know why he is in the year 2018. Can Connor trust him? There will be some mild twists. The action starts with a bang. Explosions, chase scenes and one-to-one fights scenes with terminators. They are intense. There were times that made my heart pounded like scenes where MCG aimlessly put loud music in almost silent parts. The music is good but not as epic as the past movies like Terminator 2.<br/><br/>Overall: It is a mindless action movie where almost all of the characters have only one goal in mind. Action is good and intense with explosions. Terminators' fans will definitely flock the cinema to see whether it is worthy to be in the name of terminator. MCG's fans will be proud that he has done a good job. Whether it is not like a terminator film, it will still be included in the terminator series. There may be a sequel or not..."
"trantor2nd","8","65","117","27 May 2009"," Not as heartfelt as the first two, but a good effort.
","Newcomers complained about needing knowledge from the previous installments. I felt that all the basics were recapped. Also, there were many parallelisms/ homages to the previous films. This movie measures up with the action and special effects but lacks the expected pacing of a Terminator movie. I've come to expect a progressive and relentless increase in intensity as the movie progresses but this one decreases in scale. The ending also leaves much to be desired, as even the third movie had a better one. Planning this as a new trilogy should have gave them leeway to make an ending that measures up to the previous movies, or even to the rest of this film. As it is, the ending makes T4 a complete episode in itself, with little weight to carry over to the next movies and make them a thematic whole. I'd score the first half of the movie an edge-of-your-seat 10, the end battle a passable 7, the epilogue a hokey 4. The music by Danny Elfman also seems less than an improvement over Brad Fiedel's previous score. The movie didn't seem to suffer much from the PG rating. Less blood and gore but much more explosions. All in all, the movie was inspired but lacked heart. I'd still look forward to T5."
"Medacakathareal","6","143","273","22 May 2009"," Terminator Fans might find it a Tad Disappointing
","I've always been a fan of the Terminator series, T2 was one of the first films I can actually remember watching as a kid and comprehending the plot. As I grew older both Terminator films stayed a staple of my sci-fi cinema diet and both are landmark films in their own right.<br/><br/>Like a lot of people I was kinda bummed by T3, it was an okay film but a FAR cry from the first two so I was psyched for Salvation when I first heard about it, but as each successive trailer was released and the PG-13 locked into place I found myself worried that it would be a let down...<br/><br/>As it turns out its not as bad as I thought it would be, the action sequences are thrilling and gripping, the plot isn't all that bad and there's enough violence to make it R-Rated-ish... The acting also turned out surprisingly well with Sam Worthington (playing Marcus) and Anton Yelchin (playing Kyle Reese) being the two stand out performers. I swear there were times I Anton looked and sounded exactly like Michael Biehn who played Kyle in the original film and it was that fact (as well as a few other homages) that kept the hardcore Terminator fan in me placated...<br/><br/>But placation isn't the same as satisfaction, the film has its flaws, the bad language you'd expect in a post-apocalyptic world is suppressed by the PG-13 rating and Bale delivers an overly dramatic performance to a character we learn far too little about other than what we know happened to him as a kid... My other major complaint is the CGI used for the Terminators themselves, it really didn't look good and I found myself praying for them to go back to Practical Effects where things look solid and real...<br/><br/>Remember how relentless the Terminator was in the first film?? Well that is carried over here, these guys won't stop until their processor is dead, but since they're CGI for the most part it lessens the feel of real danger... Somewhere deep inside the Terminator fan in me was wishing to return to that dark skull covered gritty landscape we saw glimpses of in the first Terminator (this definitely isn't the future Connor's Mother warned him about)<br/><br/>Hardcore terminator fans might want to avoid this, it was better than T3 but still pretty far off the quality of the first two, still, if its a Summer Blockbuster you want then go see Terminator Salvation, you could do a lot worse..."
"Allswell007","Null","72","132","22 May 2009"," Believe The Critics... Awful
","Sad to say that Terminator Salvation failed to resurrect the franchise with the same quality that Batman Begins resuscitated the Batman or Star Trek resurrected that franchise. TS is the huge misfire that it appeared to be from reading all the critics bash it. It may not be the exact unsatisfying continuation of the T3 dud but it's a new type of unsatisfying mess. Just like Poseidon and Pink Panther, it's clear Hollywood just wanted to cash in on nostalgia instead of creating quality, original concepts. Bad film on nearly every level.<br/><br/>Disappointing to say the least. The movie is a one note bore until John Conner's one man raid to end the film. The dialogue is atrocious. Slipping in the ""I'll be back"" line was as forced a line as I've ever seen. In fact, it drew an audible groan from the crowd I saw it with. Leaps in logic and rather mundane action drop this film to the bottom of the barrel in terms of summer blockbuster material. I honestly can't think of one thing the director did right. Shooting this one note crapfest through panty-hose to give it a grainy feel may have seemed like an artistic touch but all it did was add to the unsavory feel and genuine disappointment this movie will generate."
"Egg_MacGuffin","1","54","97","26 May 2009"," Judgement Day for cinema.
","Spoilers ahead. If you decide not to read them and go to see the movie instead, don't say I didn't warn you.<br/><br/>I am appalled. I don't even know where to start. Maybe the title: Terminator Salvation. First, it's not even really a Terminator movie. John Connor was rewritten as the main character, which put Marcus Wright in the background, thus rendering a Terminator character secondary. But even if it was called John Connor Salvation, it still wouldn't make any sense because there is no salvation to be had.<br/><br/>Honestly, what is the point of this ""story""? What is the culmination of the events? Skynet wasn't destroyed. The resistance gained no advantage. NOTHING was accomplished! The humans are fighting the machines at the start and at the finish. One Skynet base - one - was blown up somehow. No idea how or when the entire facility was wired for implosion, but it was. So what was the purpose of all this fighting? Skynet designs a prototype Terminator that doesn't even know he's a Terminator. I thought the machines were supposed to be smart. This Terminator had every opportunity in the world to squish Kyle Reese's head, but - oh yeah, Kyle Reese is in this movie. Don't even get me started on that.<br/><br/>But anyway, what the hell was Skynet's plan for killing John Connor?! Lure him to the Skynet base, let him inside to free hundreds of human prisoners, then send ONE naked CGI Arnold after him?! Are you freaking kidding me? And why was Kype Reese, Skynet's number one target, allowed to remain alive for - what, like three days? I don't understand any of this.<br/><br/>The world's most advanced intelligence looks like a bunch of dumb-asses in this movie. John Connor takes down a super-advanced cycle-thing that's capable of countless super-fast calculations with a trick from The Road Runner cartoons? Give me a break! Who the hell wrote this script? Are you somebody's 7 year-old cousin? There's a prologue text that appears at the beginning of the film that offers a good idea - John Connor being seen as a false prophet by many. But where in the blue hell are these non-believers in the actual story? The only guy that doesn't believe in Connor is Michael Ironside, who simply doesn't believe because the script calls for it.<br/><br/>The Oriental-looking woman - who somehow has freshly shampooed and deep-conditioned hair during a nuclear apocalypse - is tossed in for the sake of...well, who knows. She's there. She does nothing and acts irrationally.<br/><br/>The acting in this movie is so bad, I can't think of a word to accurately describe just how bad it is. It's THAT bad. Every line is delivered in either a dramatic whisper or a dramatic shout when the context of the scenes usually calls for neither. Don't people TALK in movies anymore? Talking can be dramatic. Yelling when you don't have to and whispering for no reason is just retarded, especially when everything that's said is completely obvious and on the nose. It's not even melodramatic...it's worse.<br/><br/>There are many references to the first two films that are as pointless as they are countless, thrown in simply because this movie has no good ideas of its own. Nobody is going to remember this film one year from now, but we'll still love the original two.<br/><br/>I really can't think of one single redeeming quality of this catastrophic disaster of a movie. Maybe the fact that is has some giant robots, but I can get from Robot Jox...an equally terrible film that is at least a funny kind of terrible. T4 is just terrible. It's seriously one of the worst films I have seen in recent memory."
"ffiisshh","1","299","605","20 May 2009"," If Cameron were dead he would be spinning in his grave.
","Phenomenal special effects. CGI second to none. Good score. Great sound.<br/><br/>If these are the reasons for you giving up your 10 bucks, then this is the movie for you.<br/><br/>If, however, you enjoy those small luxuries, like a plot; solid performances; character to care about; and a point to it all, you may want to redirect your $10 to something else....anything else.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong...I am a major fan of the Terminator films. I know them inside and out. I genuinely love these movies (3 was tolerable), but this one is a travesty.<br/><br/>The actors, (particularly Christian Bale) seem to be much more interested in appearing super-cool (very ""Matix-esque"") and striking a pose for the camera, than actually getting down and delivering convincing performances as people caught up in this future war. (No Oscar Schindler/Liam Neeson performances here.) The result is very card-board-cut-out characters that the audience can not connect with on any appreciable emotional level, which is a shame, considering how well Christian Bale can perform in other films.<br/><br/>Also, the editing pace is way too frenetic at times. I's the new generation of film makers that believe if you can not keep the audience involved in the story or characters, throw a lot of images and sound at such an intense rate, essentially bombard them, that the audience will be convinced they got their dollar's worth.<br/><br/>The film suffers on another level. There was so much anticipation for it's release, and figuring a good cast and the stamp of approval from Cameron's group that this should have turned out fairly decent. This could have been good Science-Fiction. Instead, we get a loud,obnoxious, mindless made-for-MTV video for the masses!"

"Tyson14","7","10","14","24 July 2015"," A dark and gritty view of the future
","I had doubts about this film when it was released but despite all the negative feedback that it has received, I really liked it.<br/><br/>John Connor, for once, is portrayed as a strong albeit reluctant hero and leader instead of a whiny kid afraid of his future and Christian Bale portrays him very well, capturing the desperation and tortured emotions of a man who has to fulfil a destiny that he is starting to doubt. However, the main focus of this film is given to Marcus Wright, a mystery man portrayed by Sam Worthington who awakens in a post apocalyptic future and tries to figure out how he ended up there. The emotions that the character goes through as he discovers startling revelations about himself are all shown convincingly by Worthington, who brings a tough but also remorseful and vulnerable appeal to Marcus's plight.<br/><br/>The third important character in the movie is Kyle Reese, the paradoxical father of John Connor who at this point is only a teenager and portrayed by Anton Yelchin, who played Chekov in the recent Star Trek movie. Reese is shown to be a hero worshipper of the resistance, especially Connor and is compelled to join him, showing traits that would be associated with the character when played by Michael Biehn back in 1984.<br/><br/>The story of the film mostly revolves around Connor trying to find Reese but also about Marcus figuring out how he arrived in the wartorn future, and the story works pretty well. The camera style is mostly hand held, which adds a more natural and first hand look to the film and makes it feel more like the audience is in a warzone. Instead of the shiny Terminators from James Cameron's movies, the machines in Salvation are dark, sinister and have a more industrial look to them and there aren't any laser rifles, the only energy weapons in existence are employed by the huge Skynet machines so generally, bullets and missiles are still the favoured artillery of the resistance.<br/><br/>Salvation does have its flaws, but for the first Terminator movie to be set entirely in the future, it does a good job of continuing the franchise and making it distinct from the Schwarzenegger-dominated past. While 'Ar-Nulhd' made this franchise a household name, it is refreshing to see new blood taking it in a different direction and the one thing I didn't like about the earlier films was how there was always an epic fight at the beginning of the film before they turned into a long and drawn out chase before another fight at the end. Salvation isn't a chase movie, it's a war movie and it's not ashamed to be different from its predecessors.<br/><br/>It could have been better but it is still a good movie, ideal for sci-fi and action fans and on a personal note, it's also fun to guess which scene Christian Bale was doing when he exploded in the now infamous rant against the lighting technician."

"janyeap","10","58","106","18 May 2009"," The values of humanity and humility that John Connor need to learn...
","Wow, an installment of the celebrated franchise, without Arnie (oops, unless, he deserves to be credited for the virtual prototype of the T-800 killer machine cameo with the familiar face)! As this film thrusts before us lots and lots of new faces, knocking off Arnie, how will the Terminator fans react to this new installment? Truthfully, I haven't missed him! Hey, there are more advanced and deadlier Terminators in this film on the kill to put us on edge. Even, the motorcycle machine killer is refreshingly imaginative! Besides, this film is not robbing the audience of the series' central theme - humanity.<br/><br/>This fourth installment is just as entertaining and fun â€“ darker for certain, and with a better focus on character development. Christian Bale does a good job as Connor, delivering enormous stamina and credibility to his immature character. Here, we see Connor, not quite close to the predicted 2029 prophesy, but drawing a step closer to fulfilling his destiny as the leader of the human resistance. In his twenties, he now steps into Bale's shoes to offer his new look, his physical skills, and his flawed mental judgment as the Skynet robots become more intelligent, almost non-destructible, and deadlier. The story begins with our introduction to Sam Worthington's Marcus Wright, a death-row inmate, who, under the persuasion and deceit of Helen Bonham Carter's Serena, donated his body to Cyberdyne Corporation. The year is 2003. We are then plunged to the post-apocalyptic 2018 <br/><br/>We encounter Connor jumping into a helicopter for a strike at a SkyNet facility while human beings are being hounded and killed by the deadly machines in the human beings' determination to destroy the facility. Even from the moment we see him, it's obvious that we'd be facing a complicating and complex character that is, nonetheless, aware of his destined purpose. Observe how effective Conner is in inspiring the humans. In the midst of the calamity and explosions, the scenes shift to Marcus Wright. Awakes, dazed and hazy initially,he soon snaps out of his blurry state. As he bumps into a Resistance soldier, Anton Yelchin's Kyle Reese and young Star, it would be difficult for the viewers to refrain from smiling. Yep, it's the Kyle Reese in the first Terminator film, the protector and savior of Sarah Connor, and the father of her child! <br/><br/>Director McG has smartly created introductions of the three principle characters whose lives must insect to generate the relevant themes for this installment. In a subtle way, it does pay tribute to the first film. Besides, there's much to examine about the unpredictable directions the characters are taking us. Even the state-of-the-art special effects are well crafted to instill fear, hopelessness and uncertainties, associated with devastation, mess, and despair, scene after scene. In a way, they serve as metaphors to Connor's personality and feelings... a rapture of havoc. Yep, the special effects do also provide the feeling and smell of metal and death... cold, as cold as the way Connor treats Wright! Can righteous cause be justified without considering its ultimate effects on mankind? <br/><br/>While following the story, I have been struck by the realization of the vital and important relevance of Wright's story in this film. Frankly, it has dawned on me Wright's story does target the interesting theme of 'second chance.' Also, his psyche, and his decision-making choices settle onto another great theme - the important value of humane wisdom of heartfelt decision-making. What can Connor learn from Wright? And how important is that? <br/><br/>Director McG has succeeded wonderfully for not only giving us another too familiar and bombastic ""terminator action film, but a story that allows the viewers to search, analyze and understand the different forms of leadership decision-making in human beings. We can see that Connor has a lot to learn before he can really succeed in moving from second-in-command to his ultimate and destined leadership. Even the brief take of the photo of Linda Hamilton's Susan Connor is a reminder that she has developed into a stronger and wiser character when she arrived at the South of the Border.<br/><br/>This film has surged up my excitement for the next installment to the celebrated series. I love this film! It does make me put on my thinking cap to examine the story much deeper than what flows visually before my eyes!"
"Simon_Says_Movies","7","53","97","2 June 2009"," By no means the best, but very impressive
","To the filmmaker's credit, for a franchise initially conceived as a standalone film, things have been kept fairly fresh over the decades. Terminator 2, widely considered to be the best of the series, managed to expand and improve almost every aspect of the original Terminator. The third, the least creative of the bunch, still explored the ominous back-story further and switched around the sex of the robotic antagonist with mixed success. Now, fully emerged in the post-judgment day world, fresh faces and astounding production values makes Terminator Salvation a unique and overall very impressive entry in the sci-fi saga.<br/><br/>Now, from director McG, we get a wildly different Terminator film; dark, gritty and nightmarish. Gone are the days of the lone hunter, replaced with a post-apocalyptic hell rank with death, desperation and viscous, cold machines. I love dystopian visions and to have such a world infused with terminators is fairly awesome to be blunt. Shot is drained, almost monochromatic colours the planet Earth after the bombs fell at the end of T3 is fully realized, even if other areas are not quite as flushed out. Gone along with most of humanity is the consistent dry humour (mostly) as is a good portion of the character driven plot of Terminator 1 and 2; yet as I alluded to before, the departure from the originals is bold and exciting.<br/><br/>4 movies, 4 John Connor's; keeping with tradition, forever rising star Christian Bale takes over the iconic role, but this is less Connor's film this time round. Instead the story is broken up amongst the future heroic leader of the resistance, John's future (or past, it's always confusing) father Kyle Reese (Anton Yelchin) and a mysterious stranger named Marcus Wright (Sam Worthington). This is perhaps Salvation's largest flaw, that the plot, divided between three main characters, along with the requisite action leaves fewer fully rounded characters. I understand that the set-up must be established and I hope that is something the already planned sequel can improve upon.<br/><br/>The story is simple, but with complex veins running throughout as well. It is 2018, still not yet the true leader of the resistance but more what the powers call a 'false profit', Connor leads the resistance in spirit, not in rank. Thinking they may be able to turn the war having discovered a signal that could destroy Skynet once and for all, Connor and his team seek to test the weapon and to find Reese in the process. But the machines have other plans as they attempt to capture Kyle Reese and end the future for good. Living in a decimated L.A., Reese saves the mysterious Marcus from a T-600 and the two unite to locate the legendary Connor and join the resistance. Intersected along the way however and taken by the machines, Reese now must hope Wright will return the favour and reach Connor in time to save him, and possibly the human race.<br/><br/>The best news for the crudely broken narrative is that all three plot line are all impeccably acted. Bale is solid as always as Connor, putting forth a more tortured sole vibe that started brewing in T3. Yelchin is nothing short of astounding in his ability to channel Reese from the original, played by Micheal Biehn, both in his line delivery and presence on screen. Worthington is perhaps the best thing about this film; another rising star and a formidable, charismatic and charming screen presence. Infuse that with spectacular effects, some gripping and well shot action sequences and you have a summer movie that while not as good as the earlier entries manages to infuse new life into a classic franchise.<br/><br/>Read all my reviews at www.simonsaysmovies.blogspot.com"

","OK, I've questioned some ratings before, but for the most part I usually just let it go very easily. But I'm curious, how in the world, no, universe, does Terminator Salvation get a rating above 7.0? This was 2 hours of my life that I will never get back and I should've known better when I saw a director who's name is ""McG"" on the screen, James Cameron must be shuddering. This film had so much incredible potential but ended up turning into Action Film 101, I don't even think the title of the movie should have been Salvation, it should have been Terminator: Let's Blow *bleep* Up! The story was so beyond stupid, the effects are way over the top, they also were trying so hard to be liked by the fans that they stole every cool line from the first two terminator films, and what the F was up with Christian Bale bringing his Batman voice back into this movie?! Despite the confusing movie, I'll try to give you a clear enough summary.<br/><br/>In 2003, Dr. Serena Kogan of Cyberdyne Systems convinces death row inmate Marcus Wright to sign his body over for medical research following his execution by lethal injection. In 2018, John Connor leads an attack by the Resistance on a Skynet base. John discovers human prisoners and the plans for the development of a new type of Terminator incorporating living tissue, but is the only apparent survivor of the attack after the base is destroyed in a nuclear explosion. However, Marcus emerges from the wreckage of the base and proceeds on foot to Los Angeles. Meanwhile, the Resistance has discovered a radio frequency capable of shutting down Skynet machines. They plan to launch an offensive against the Skynet base in San Francisco in four days, in response to an intercepted ""kill list"" indicating that Skynet plans to kill the Resistance's command staff in four days' time. John learns that his own name is second on the list, following Kyle Reese. Nobody realizes why they must keep Kyle safe but Conor knows that he must send Kyle back to save the future.<br/><br/>Never have I ever wanted so badly to hurt a director before, I just couldn't believe this movie. Who was the main character? Who was I supposed to root for? Now I was 7 years old when I discovered the Terminator films, can't tell you how they changed my life, they were the reason I adore action movies to this day. But they were also more then action movies, they told incredible stories and were displayed on film in such an excellent way, I just can't tell you how wonderful the experience was. This was just agonizing, I mean, a retarded jellyfish could make a better movie then this. They kept going with a confusing story line to explain everything at the end and by that time I just didn't care. The actors, the story, the effects and setting of the film was just horrible, Terminator Salvation is a shameful movie and if was a person, should be shot.<br/><br/>1/10"
"C-Younkin","7","73","139","20 May 2009"," Summer popcorn fun
","""Terminator Salvation"" is the best offering this series has given in quite a while, not saying much considering the lackluster showings of both the third movie and the television show but still better praise than I was expecting to give it. We're still far from the narrative brilliance of a ""T2"" and that will undoubtedly put this movie under scrutiny from the hardcore ""Terminator"" fans, but if I may, I'd like to turn those vengeful eyes away from director McG. Despite its short-comings, this movie looks terrific and it's every bit the big, dumb, loud, thrill-a-minute action movie that usually defines the season of popcorn fluff. You may be disappointed by the overall lack of story and meager character development (I know I was), but it's a damn entertaining action movie nonetheless and for that I credit McG.<br/><br/>John Connor (Christian Bale) has grown up. He is not the leader of the resistance just yet but he does command a unit of his own and he does address most of the other units through the radio every night. In addition to his role as a general, Connor also spends a great deal of effort trying to find teenager Kyle Reese (Anton Yelchin), who will later grow up to go back in time and knock-up John's mother, thus creating John. The other part of the story centers on Reese traveling with a man named Marcus Wright (Sam Worthington), a stranger whose last living memory is being on death row. When the machines catch on to Reese's destiny and capture him, Wright wakes up to find he is Connor's prisoner. It seems that in addition to having a human heart, he is also made of metal. Connor thinks Wright is there to assassinate him but Wright is just as confused as Connor. The men form an alliance, both with the objective of saving Reese.<br/><br/>McG creates a bleak 2018 future. Everything has been bombed to rubble, resources are scarce, and it's all real dingy-looking, the perfect playground to go nuts with technical toys. Aircraft rumble through the air, giant transformer-like robots suddenly come out of nowhere and grab people like rag dolls, motorcycles break off from the robot's feet (which leads to one of the movie's best chases), land-mines are another big surprise, as are robotic snakes. The T-600 is pretty scary and the T-800 very much so, the T-800 also features a very familiar face from the past that will have fans cheering. There is a ton of fire-power and explosions and the final raid on Skynet is thrilling to say the least. So much is happening here that it's a shame the movie also feels hollow. There is no real dramatic tension until the third act when the birth of John Connor again must be saved. It's a familiar plot line with a too predictable outcome to add the dramatic weight the film could really use.<br/><br/>The human cast finds itself pretty much overshadowed by the electronics as well. Watching Christian Bale I couldn't help but think back to his rant, where he berated a photographer for taking him out of a scene. I find it funny because the role never really requires him to go that deep. Much of his performance is a lot of yelling and shouting, that's about it. The female cast, which includes Bryce Dallas Howard, Moon Bloodgood, and Helena Bonham Carter have even less to do. Worthington is the only one who gets much of a conflict and he plays the robot/human angle to tragic effect. He will definitely be an actor to watch this year as he also has a role coming up in James Cameron's (not just movie) but 3-D event ""Avatar"" coming in December.<br/><br/>""Terminator Salvation"" proves that there is still more fun you can have with the ""Terminator"" franchise but it needs to find more of a narrative focus. Movies about humans trying to preserve humanity only work if those humans figure more into the plot. Here they're fantastic action stars and the actors playing them are likable enough but overall they don't leave much of an impression. Neither does the story, which is still all about saving John Connor. It's time for Connor to step up, be a leader and end the war once and for all. Unfortunately that will probably only happen when the studio sees the money from the franchise start to dry up but one can only hope that a proper send-off will eventually be put in the works. Until that day comes, movies like ""Terminator Salvation"" aim to add a little bit of enjoyment to your summer day and in that it succeeds mightily."

","The machines have taken over the world, wiping out humanity and making them live like rats among the desolate wastelands littered with human skulls and the remains of a desperate struggle for survival. Right? Not exactly. Let me explain. That description of post-judgement day America was heavily featured in the first two movies and is what we all expected to find plastering the scenes of salvation, coupled with epic Saving Private Ryan style battle scenes as the resistance make a futile attempt at stopping the wrecking ball that is sky net. unfortunately it seems sky net is not the unstoppable force that we were led to believe, with the resistance camped out in daylight, in plane-sight for anybody who cares to look and the terminator army comprising of a few T-600s (clearly sky net hadn't realised how susceptible to bullets these models were) and some rejects from the transformers movie. So John Conner (Cristian 'Master of Accents'*pfffft* Bale) has discovered that Skynet is after Kyle Reese (his father who is younger than him but went to the past to stop his mother being wiped out so john could be born and ended up biffing her and getting her pregnant, but surely john had to be born before hand so maybe he would be born anyway - i digress) and John must pick between his life or mankind... Oh yeah, there's this guy Marcus, who's not a guy but a terminator (which we all knew cus of the trailers) but they don't know on screen until half way through the movie, but its got organs, oh wait... i don't care anymore. It all climaxes with the rather disappointing raid on sky net (which proves rather easy for our hero, ya know, considering its the Skynet HQ... HALLO!) and then a thought provoking aftermath - ""what truly separates man from the machines""... very poetic. It could have been, if the acting wasn't so undeniably ""aaaaaangrrryyy"", with Bale delivering his 'American-Jason Statham-angry' voice he used in his incarnation as batman. I swear there was even a scene where he was just shouting into the radio for no real reason... I understand why hes angry, roped into this heap of a mess, relying on its use of millions of dollars worth of FX and an orchestral underscore and nothing on narrative or character development or interaction that commits the viewer through emotion or engaging dialogue. IT Doesn't EVEN USE THE ACTUAL TERMINATOR THEME!!!! JUST THE DRUMS!!! The movie is rated PG-13 or 12A and rightly so, it features nothing cool what so ever, and very little violence to command a higher rating. There See a few small battle scenes, a lot of chasing (which, fair point, the terminator movies were all about the chase) and a massive chase scene with a giant robot, and some terminator bikes. These bikes have USB ports on them by the way... laughable isn't it. But wait, what the hell, considering the Terinators are unstoppable, i never seen one persons head get punched through, or stepped on, in fact, human deaths were very little, but with little action comes little deaths (except myself dying on the inside). You cant blame the studios for this, they are just trying to gain a new generation of people into the franchise... In case you hadn't guessed that was totally sarcastic, blame the studios. In focusing on a lower target audience they have eliminated the fans, messing up what could have potentially been the best movie ever. This movie could had easily been the epic return to form we all hoped for after the 'not so bad, but terrible compared to the rest of the series' Rise of the Machines. Instead were left bitter, twisted and a little dead inside that this diabolical mess was able to get made. The best bit is a brief fight with a CGI Arnie, which while the highlight of the film, shows just how unsatisfying and unoriginal the rest of the film is... Give the budget of this film to any fan of the originals and they could easily make a better film than this. And they could easily churn out a better script than this 10 page drinks coaster. OK, the effects are pretty good, just wish they were used to create something totally different from this. My advice is this, if your going to watch this, don't say i didn't warn you, this is grade A compost heap stuff. With the license they had and the money they used to make this, it could have been a spectacular, instead its a complete turkey of a film that without its high profile brand name would fall flat on its metal shiny arse and fade into the bargain bins... the only upside of this films release is that DVD prices for the original trilogy will plummet. bewsh 1/10 - watch T1 and T2 instead and bathe in nostalgia... avoid this at all costs because you will be disappointed, and empty."
"sendrizzi","7","83","161","18 May 2009"," Good summer action flick - some things will blow you away, others....
","Definitely see this one on the big screen! The sounds and visual effects at times are almost overwhelming! Great CGI and visually the future world and war are very believable. The story for me was just OK - I felt that some emotions and character development seemed to happen too fast and there were a few cheesy parts I had to roll my eyes at. Without giving too much - one little character in particular I found quite tiresome. One of my favorite movies growing up was Terminator 2 and this one falls far short. I'd say its about on par with the original Terminator (without a doubt better than T3). See it in the theater and enjoy the action and special effects - that alone is enough to make it worth the price of admission!"
"orionschwert","8","3","3","22 April 2020"," What is the problem ?
","1st Terminator will always be my favorite. It was the 80', I grew up....was maybe 12 years old when my mother brought this film home to watch together on VHS. I loved my Mom for being so cool to let me watch it and it completely hammered me away. Today, so many years later, I can hear my self sometimes humming the theme when ironing or doing dishes or something else which leaves to much space in my brain available. So it became part of my ""brain-screen-savers"", if you understand my meaning. The Terminator franchise is something important to me as I had bound so strong to the 1st.
Judgement Day then was again something which overwhelmed me. Now the 90', me still in school but this time it was Cinema with friends. Holy moly, they did it again. That was well spent time and money at that time. A real action block bluster and a worthy nr 2.
The 3rd was the first big disappointment. Typical 3rd.....nothing big anymore, mediocre in its acting and overall making. Only scenes still stuck a bit in my mind was the Truck-chase in the streets and Mrs Terminator who could inflate her boobies if needed. That was, I have to admit, an somewhat intreaging idea.
But Terminator was dead for me. They killed it.<br/><br/>But they reanimated it as well! With Terminator Salvation !<br/><br/>Sweet cast and absolutely fine crafted. It is an entertaining action movie with nasty robots, dooms-day feeling and heroes fighting in resistance. Good story, good action, good acting, and many little flash backs like Guns'n'Roses music and "" I'll be back"". Can you really expect more from something which was dead ? How can people here rate this film so badly? And if you know that anything which came and will come afterwards will be rubbish again, then this one earned its 8 stars from me."

No out of character jokes like T3 and the silliness of Genysis.<br/><br/>There are some amazing scenes, this film trades big budget emotionless action scenes for more personal intense realistic altercations between earlier terminator designs.<br/><br/>The film is not quite a classic but thoroughly enjoyable serious about what it wants to achieve. This is a story arc and setting I would love to see another sequel to.<br/><br/>Hopefully after the bombs of Genysis and Dark Fate we can get back to a story which concentrates on the script and character development.

","This sorry excuse of a film does nothing to add to the Terminator franchise. The editing is choppy, the story is diluted and the characters are about as wooden as Howdy Doody (except less entertaining) This film is simply another cash cow to lure happy consumers to something familiar rather than banking on original ideas. They should have used the budget to focus more on story, mood and character development rather than fancy special effects and Christian Bale's salary. The tone of the terminators used in this movie do no illicit any type of horror or suspense but are used merely for props so Christian Bale can yell at everyone for not getting his way.

Why you might ask, answer the audience in the cinema consisted of kids of 12 or the elderly. I mean 12A for a Terminator film should have guessed! Come on Hollywood I know the bar was set low after T3 but that's no excuse. Who made the decision to have the director of Charlie's Angels on board as Arnie says in Last Action Hero ""Big Mistake!"" T1 and T2 were successful because you cared about the characters and the terminators were unstoppable brutal and killing machines. This one the main character's best contribution is to act as a organ donor!

"amazing_sincodek","7","66","132","18 May 2009"," The weakest film in the Terminator series, but a lot of fun nonetheless. Completely different from the previous films.
","I saw ""Salvation"" at an advance screening a few hours ago. The word to describe it is ""different."" Everything about it. For one, it's definitely a PG-13 film, both in terms of tone and on screen violence. Second, the plot has nothing to do with someone going back in time to kill a member of the Conner family. Nor is there a single persistent antagonist motivating all of the action--the plot is more broad, and the characters and audience have plenty of time to catch their breath between action scenes. The setting is post-apocalyptic, and the aesthetic reminds me more of a video game than any film (think Gears of War, or Fallout 3). It's bleak, desaturated, and fascinating. In fact, I think that the visuals might have been my favorite thing about the film.<br/><br/>For me, these differences generally made for an inferior film. The biggest disappointment for me was the PG-13 tone of the film--not nearly as bleak as the aesthetic. Though I don't feel that graphic violence is necessary to make a film enjoyable, there needs to be some sort of sincere menace for an action film to maintain tension. In ""Salvation,"" however, the machines have become surprisingly helpless. Machines armed with machine guns do a lot of shooting, but I can't remember any humans ever getting shot. The humans themselves maintain a rather cheery attitude, as well as often enviable hygiene. There is no indication that any of them are bothered by the end of world or fatigued by all the fighting.<br/><br/>That said, it really was a lot of fun. A lot of crowd-pleasing allusions are made to the previous films. The biggest machines are a lot of fun to look at, as are the blackened urban landscapes. The plot is rather clever, though at times its exposition is marred by out-of-place sentimentality. In short, it could have been a thousand times worse.<br/><br/>Still, I remember how horrifying I found the brief scenes of the future as portrayed in T1--how vulnerable the human resistance appeared in a world controlled by monstrous machines. The gentleness of ""Salvation"" is, for me, a disappointment."

","OK, OK. Just saw this at a screening, and all I can say is: Wow.<br/><br/>This Terminator goes beyond the previous movie installments and really shows you how entertaining movies can be. To start off, the special effects were top-notch and action packed; Transformers 2 is going to have serious competition with Salvation for sure. The movie certainly delivers in all aspects of action and CG, but I wont linger on with the special effects, you will just have to see the movie your self.<br/><br/>As for the story....Well, the first 2 Terminator movies were for the most part chase movies, where this movie really expanded on the Terminator franchise. In the first Terminator movies, they give brief scenes of the future with relative cheesiness, where in Salvation, it shows the world that I thought would be cool to see after watching the first Terminator, which is: the future. So, the story was cool, I won't give anything away, but I thought it was awesome to see a war against machines, rather than one terminator chasing one person, like in the first Terminator; of course the first Terminator movies were better, but I just liked this adaption very much as well.<br/><br/>As for the acting: Christian Bale was a convincing John Connor and did a great job playing the leader of the resistance, whereas if Nick Stahl(the John Connor from T3) was in Christian Bale's place...that would have been funny, and not in a good way. Sam Worthington pulled off an outstanding performance, but...the rest of the cast wasn't as great as the leading actors...which was OK, but it was the only downer to the movie. McG didn't disappoint in delivering a solid action movie, although I do think they could have got a better director. =/ Soooo...overall this was a great popcorn-action-summer movie that is awesome, and probably anyone will enjoy it, whether you are a Terminator fan or not."

The biggest problem with ""Terminator Salvation"" is the absence of Arnold Schwarzenegger. The terminator series can't work well without him, in my opinion. He's sorely missed in this messy very loud movie. A generic robot can't replace Arnold , who defined the franchise.

","When I think of the ""Terminator"" film franchise, two things immediately come to mind: an iconic leading actor (like Arnold Schwarzenegger) who can carry the film, and an interesting time-travel plot that will keep you engaged while things are blowing up. This film, by casting Christian Bale and continuing the basic timeline, ensures a successful fourth installment.<br/><br/>Basically, in ""Terminator Salvation"", we finally get a glimpse into the future, where a group of human resistance fighters led by John Connor (Bale) are battling to stay alive as the machines hunt them down one colony at a time. While the war rages on, Connor listens to the tapes handed to him from his mother at the conclusion of T2 and realizes that he must find and protect young Kyle Reese in order to maintain his (and mankind's) entire existence. Complicating matters is the fact that the robotic Skynet has created their ultimate weapon...a ""terminator"" who thinks he is a human, throwing Connor and his gang for a loop.<br/><br/>Though not a classic film in any sense of the word, I felt that this addition was welcome to the franchise for its ability to show what the earlier films only hinted at...the human resistance against Skynet. The casting of Bale lends automatic credence to the entire project, and he lives up to the billing with the best-acted performance of the show, and the human-cyborg plot angle does two things: preview the ""terminators"" of the future, and set up an interesting ethical dilemma for Connor.<br/><br/>Plus, I also loved the subtle nods to the three previous installments in the franchise, such as a cameo from Arnold and Bale's own twist on the iconic ""I'll be back"" line.<br/><br/>Thus, although I feel that this film could have been much more epic, it was, as a fan of the Terminator franchise, entertaining enough to hold my interest until the very end. It also sets the stage for a possible sequel, which would be the true test of whether this re-boot will be the next ""Batman Begins"", or instead turn into ""Superman Returns""."

It doesn't follow the previous model of the first three installments exactly. Rather, it adds a twist on the old storyline.<br/><br/>While director McG did a great job with camera angles, explosions and the overall lasting affect on us audience members, the acting, CGI and permeable story.<br/><br/>T1, T2 and also T3 used real props, though T3 did use more CGI than props. T4 relies solely on CGI for it's gigantic space craft, motorcycle robots and other technological items.<br/><br/>T4's story is weak and seems virtually impossible. How can Connor and his men still have all these weapons and aircraft? Wouldn't the machines simply locate them and destroy. They did it once, why not again? And the worst part is the acting. Sam Worthington emerges from an obliterated crater and into a devastated planet, only to immediately accept the idea of Judgment Day. Kind of weak. Bale does a good job but with the minimal use of Bryce Dallas Howard as Kate Connor the movie lacks the emotional balance between the hatred of people versus machines the understanding human nature common with woman.<br/><br/>I don't know. It was an all right movie, but I'll stick with the first three. Maybe T5 will make better sense."

","Terminator Salvation was actually a movie I was looking forward to see. Then I read who the director was, McG and I dropped any idea of this movie being spectacular on any level. Still that left me hope of some mediocrity and a clichéd but yet for the most part fun ride. Well trust me you will get all of that except the fun or even the ride, and that was me in the movie theatres.<br/><br/>The film was hardly ever engaging, yet they were some great elements to the film. Such as the visual and sound effects along with the music, that is probably about it. Then came all the problems, and the most glaring one was Christian Bale. Not only was he a disappointment but he wasn't did not even give the best performance in the film nor even the second best. His performance was incredibly dry in a way that you would have never thought the character he was playing, John Connor, had made his first appearance in a film. Of course this is not true with the first three Terminator films but Bale in no way makes you think the latter instead. With Bale setting the bar so low it was a surprise to actually see Sam Worthington, a virtual unknown to most, have a some what fascinating performance as well as that of Anton Yelchin. Even with these characters do we ever get the feeling of caring about them? That answer is an easy not. There was an opportunity to possibly do so but as the movie winded down, more screen time was given to the ""star"" in Christian Bale and the film was at the point were wouldn't careless about what really happens to him. <br/><br/>If you have seen any of McG's movies you will know from the opening minutes this film follows along the same sort of line as his past films. During moments of his movies you wonder if you're even watching the same movie you started out with and that is by no means a good thing. Its as if scenes are stolen straight out of other movies that have been successful and rolled together to make a movie that barely surpasses that of cable TV movie that would premiere at 3 am. Even with that his movies usually have some sort of a point, no matter how corny or clichéd the ride was to take us there.<br/><br/>So who is to blame then? That only leaves the screenwriters left who I bare no compassion for, mind you these are the same pair of writers that brought us Catwoman. Michael Ferris and John D. Brancato are their names and considering their extended history of mostly co-screen writing movies this shouldn't come as much as a surprise. If there is anyone looking for salvation, it is not the humans of John Connor's world but the screenwriters of our world that helped create this.<br/><br/>Obviously I would not recommend this debacle of a film. Nevertheless there is still something to take out of this film; before ever watching a film, don't look at the cast, not even the director (which if you remember was the mistake I made), at least not at first. Make sure you take a peak at who the writer is even if it is an action film. This is assuming you are interested in seeing a movie that has something which is at least on the verge of containing a real plot or on the realm being a credible film."

","In continuing the Hollywood trend of destroying once highly regarded film franchises (Aliens, Predator, the Star Wars films), Terminator: Salvation is a muddled, incoherent, illogical disaster of a movie. Besides actually negating plot points established in the previous films, T:S goes even a step further by draining all that was original in them, like a creative siphon. While the film's flaws are too many to list in such a limited space, the plot holes and ill-conceived story devices alone warrant the rating:<br/><br/><ul><li>How do the machines know Kyle Reese is John's father? </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Why do machines of such advanced intelligence have a headquarters? Wouldn't they exist without a central physical presence in the world, like the internet? Why do they need key pads on their doors? </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>What's the point of 9 foot tall Terminators? The entire idea of a human looking cyborg is for an undetectable killing machine.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>In the first Terminator films, humanity is presented as surviving like rats, since machines have the surface of the world conquered. Yet here we see military bases in broad daylight....why can't the machines hit these bases with everything they have?</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Again, if these machines are so advanced, why can't they detect simple radio waves like John Connor uses to send messages?</li></ul><br/><br/>There are far more holes than this, but upon reflection, these were the most glaring. The only positive aspect of the film were the solid visual effects, by the consistently strong ILM. This a film that never should have been made in the first place, and definitely not by such a hack director as McG."

If you're going to make a series of movies, say a trilogy, the first rule is that each movie has to be able to stand out on its own, as an individual series of events that have their own beginning and end.

It is now at 7.2 at the time of writing (As I am sure sane people like myself are beginning to vote, to pull this ridiculous score down).<br/><br/>Even Terminator 3 which was fairly average takes a giant steaming turd on Terminator Salvations head in terms of quality / story / Characters... the list goes on.

The story just ignored the other films completely and quite frankly doesn't deserve to have the name Terminator anywhere near it.<br/><br/>Future war? what future war? were are the armies of terminators firing pulse rifles and machines rolling over piles of human skulls? What we get instead are what look like Terminators but in actual fact they act like zombies chasing their targets. What happens when they catch the human they are after? I hear you ask... well instead of doing their job which is actually terminate them (excuse the pun) they decide to rough them up a bit by throwing them very hard off a metal post or across the floor then throw their guns away... then walk after them very slowly again, just giving them enough time to get up and run away again for another Benny Hill style chase.<br/><br/>In the other movies the terminators were stone cold killers. You actually thought that if they caught John, Sarah or whoever then it was bam, dead instantly... quick snap of the neck, bullet to the head whatever. The T1000 didn't mess about, you got in his way you got a knife rammed through your torso without so much as a word uttered.<br/><br/>Ill not be going anywhere near the cinema for the next films.

And Skynet's plan to wipe out the resistance would have done Sun Tzu proud. But all the way through, something was nagging at me, and not in a good way. It took me about ten minutes after the movie was over to realize it.<br/><br/>Skynet's plan was to capture Kyle Reese, John Connor's father, and take him to one of its bases, then lure John in to rescue him. Once he arrived, then he would be captured and both of them would be killed, thus eliminating the threat to it throughout the time stream. But here's the problem: the plot hole, once you realize it, sinks the whole movie.<br/><br/>Skynet never learned the identity of John Connor's father, so how would it know which human to use as bait? The movie probably could've been just as good without this little bit, but maybe the screenwriters decided to get clever and throw it in, I don't know. All I do know is that one bit ruined an otherwise pretty good film."

","I'm back. And I'm upset. I thoroughly enjoyed all three of the first Terminator films. The first two few told the story and the third was just plain fun. This however, was an unnecessary mess. The minute the movie started, I could tell something wasn't right. This installment takes place after Judgement Day. First of all, they brought in an entire new cast. They could have easily brought back Nick Stahl for John Conner and Claire Danes as Kate Brewster but they replaced both. Christian Bale is an ideal John Conner, I suppose, but I his performance was so emotionless that I didn't care about him at all. And Bryce Dallas Howard as Kate chose not to continue the the feisty personality that made so fun to watch. She feels like a completely different person here. The script is poorly written and so instead, the movie is filled with scene after scene of meaningless war and battle sequences. It is very average, cliché, mainstream, Hollywood entertainment (I wouldn't even go so far to say it's entertainment) I don't know how any fan of the originals could enjoy this movie. We learned and saw all we needed to know of the future and Judgement Day from the flash forwards in the first three films. The scenes that worked the best were with Helena Bonham Carter and Arnold Schwarzenegger but, unfortunately for us, those were few. I highly recommend to skip this ""Terminator"" film if you are a fan, as it adds nothing important to the series. I hope the new reboot will be better."

The cruelty to the little Afro boy by Worthington's expressionless character also has no basis as he suddenly has to prove his worthiness as a resistance fighter before his Sky-net status is revealed. <br/><br/>The first half of the film is like a stylistic mad max meets transformer.<br/><br/>The appearance of Arnie at the local Sky-net headquarters even fails to prevent this film sinking into a mindless sycophantic film suited your usual Blind Aussie actor fans and tasteless morons. <br/><br/>It is not even worth adding to my terminator trilogy of my library as it betrays the theme and brand of the film. <br/><br/>Also I find it absolutely hysterically goofy that Christian bales character did not bring the so called special energy pulsar with him that is supposed to act as an off switch to the Sky-net controlled militia at its headquarters. <br/><br/>The film is stupid and suited for Bu t-fu ckers that will no doubt flame me for my criticism. Christian bales delvers the only credible acting performance but is not required to do that much and Worthington will no doubt buy more roles in films on a royalty exchange deal.

","i just saw it today and unfortunately it was a MAJOR LETDOWN from the very beginning. Here a the facts and my opinion:<br/><br/>CONS ====<br/><br/><ul><li>Instead, of having John Connor remembering and explaining to us what happened after the nuclear blast / judgment day.. the movie abruptly starts showing us Marcus a prisoner who will get soon executed. Then suddenly the camera flip out of nowhere to Conor jumping in a big whole in the battlefield ... + the camera jumps again to connor walking in a tunnel with no explanation</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>shaky camera</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>80% of the movie used close-ups to faces, objects and non-necessary objects such as the foot/ fingers of the terminator = This removes the suspense and significantly degrades the quality of the movie to me. - Another thing bad in this movie were the quickly filmed DAY LIGHT SCENES = they seemed non realistic (especially the terminators) and they provided no chills / suspense to the audience. T1 and T2 were shot mainly at night = giving it an amazing feel of fear e.g </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Many many scenes had no transitions or meaning and therefore didn't make much sense in the development of the story since the director never took time to explain beforehand how was the story evolving = failure</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>moon bloodgood sucked big time and the love story btw her and the Terminator was a joke. People were laughing the theatre especially in the scene where she tells him ""I need human/body heat"" to keep her warm. no really first the acting in THAT SCENE was plain BAD and second that line even made it more look like a comedy.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>the ending was really a joke/ comedy, since when a heart transplantation can be performed that easily from Marcus to Conor? How could have Conor survive such a wound that went from his back and out of his chest.. not only his heart would be damaged but his lungs too.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>terminators are BARELY shown for 2-3seconds before the camera switches to Conor or other persons. What do you have to CUT the hell out of a scene while its ALL about viewing the damn robot!!!??????? why would anyone care seeing the foot, finger or even the left arm of at terminator? T1 and T2 showed the T-800 and T-1000 for long minutes and we all appreciated the distant plans ... observing them run, shoot in full motion - but why did you have to KILL that in T4?</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The helicopter crash scene with Conor was horrible = the camera was too close to the helicopter not clarifying how it was attacked and by what it was attacked.... really poor directing.</li></ul><br/><br/>+ Seeing Arnolds face and fight for 1-2 minutes was a relief.. but the joy didn't last long until they screwed it up at the end again.<br/><br/>PS: James Cameron should damn you all for what you have done to the Terminator Series. What a SHAME! For me as well the series starts at from T1 and ends at T2 thats it.<br/><br/>DO NOT PICK McG again for Terminator 5 else I am not seeing it.<br/><br/>OVERALL SCORE: 2 / 10 ============="
"fgh_fr_wh_fr3","10","10","16","25 May 2009"," A Terminator movie in which more sequels can surely fall back on!
","This movie was absolutely stunning! Visual effects were incredible, the story line was very innovative, anybody a fan of Terminator or sci-fi action movies will not want to miss this. McG, being a young director, did a fantastic job with this movie. The acting was a little dull, but each actor surprisingly filled their role pretty good for being as new to the Silver Screen, excluding Christian Bale. The action was over the top and left me speechless. I do not know why people are saying that the visual effects were bad and that the story line was bad. How can you expect something that's not even imaginable to look real, and personally, if those Terminators, H-K's, and other machines were real, I think the special effects team hit it dead on the spot as to being real. Come on guys, the story line was amazing, Marcus Wright (Sam Worthington) was the best character in the whole movie. A Terminator with a heart and free will, that is just touching, and he was surprisingly bad to the bone, he kicked some serious butt in this movie. This movie isn't supposed to really have much of a story line anyway, it's a war against the machines, the importance of Marcus Wright, the life and importance of Kyle Reese, and the rise of the T-800 machines. What more could you want? It's finally a step back from the great John Connor. It's a step back to show that John has weaknesses and that he doesn't ultimately destroy Skynet by himself. Just go see this movie, you'll be blown away! Oh and one more thing, Arnold Schwarzenegger does have a cameo role so be amazed!"
"smarielugo","1","23","44","27 May 2009"," Big disappointment, 'nough said.
","I should have followed my gut when I thought this was going to do bad, because this movie was a complete waste of time. For an action movie with a trailer that portrays fighting, there was hardly any of it. <br/><br/>The beginning was slow and basically showed John get into a plane crash and shoot a terminator with no legs. It was kind of lame, because I expected more to come of that scene but nothing really happened but him run and yell. The only part that really interested me is when Marcus met Kyle and they started their journey toward finding John. That was probably the most interesting part, hands down. After that, it was just really sad how there was very little fighting in a movie entitled ""Terminator."" The part that I thought was horribly done was the whole scene with John at Sky Net. Through out the whole time he was in Sky Net, he battled ONE terminator. Wasn't this suppose to be a war? Where are the others and why was it so easy for John to get into Sky Net? And please, let's not talk about the ""cameo"" appearance done with ""Arnold."" For all those who have seen it, you understand my quotations. The ""cameo"" appearance was so poorly done it made me giggle and I wasn't sure if that's what you do during a ""fighting"" scene. Whatever, doesn't matter. <br/><br/>All in all, this movie was a wreck. It could have been better and the trailer was a complete let down. It led you to believe that this movie was going to be about a war between humans and terminators and it seemed to be more about Marcus and John's relationship and getting Kyle. I recommend you take the advice of people who critique the movie and catch it on DVD, it's definitely not worth the 8-10 bucks you spend at a theatre."
"jamieleecurtiz","4","16","29","17 December 2009"," not worthy of the name Terminator
","This film has no soul... and surprisingly little inventive action. The cast is good (except for Bale's latest in a long line of loud, over the top performances). But they have nothing to work with in this film, which pretty much drops the ball for the Terminator franchise.<br/><br/>The first film is a classic. The second, is quite possibly the greatest action movie ever produced. Even the third film, with all of it's flaws, is still a fun, effective adventure story with a backbone and something to say.<br/><br/>This instalment however, lacks everything that makes the series loved. John has become a lone, dull, 2-dimensional character who's lost all of the vibrancy he once had. None of the characters are very full of life, even though they constantly talk about the passion of being a human being. In fact, the only truly passionate person in the story is not really a person at all, but a machine, thereby hampering the central message it tries to send.<br/><br/>There are no strong relationships in this film. You never get to know anything about anyone, so you never really care if they die. Also, the distinctive sense of humor which characterized the previous films, is nowhere to be seen. The television series Terminator:The Sarah Connor Chronicles did a much better job of keeping this series alive, passionate and vibrant. Save yourself the annoyance and watch a couple episodes of the TV show instead. It's far better.<br/><br/>There is not a single laugh or moment of true sadness here, in a humourless, heartless film that takes itself far too seriously and doesn't even know what it's trying to say.<br/><br/>A hollow, mediocre action flick, not worthy of the name terminator."
"stryker1121","Null","15","27","14 December 2009"," Worst entry of the series by far
","McG is the hamfisted directorial version of the Terminatoran unstoppable franchise destroying force who with ""Terminator Salvation"" may have managed to kill John Conner without firing a shot.<br/><br/>Salvation is a dull, cheerless exercise with not one character I cared about and not one line of dialogue that rang true. The man responsible for ""Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle"" has managed to take all the heart and emotion from James Cameron's efforts (and even the little left over from the mediocre ""T3"") and create an arch, clichéd, plot hole ridden, and above all boring Terminator film. How do you make killer robots boring? McG deserves a hearty smack for that inauspicious feat alone.<br/><br/>For all its numerous explosions, Salvation feels slight and hollow. Ostensibly good performers such as Christian Bale, Anton Yelchin and Bryce Dallas Howard don't fare well here. Sam Worthington, as a former death row inmate who's the victim of a hideous Skynet experiment, is the only player who has anything interesting to do. However, his character, like everyone else's, is so grossly underwritten that his actions later in the film have zero emotional impact.<br/><br/>Bale in particular is a disappointment. He channels his gruff Batman voice to make John Conner an angry, unlikable prick (Ah, the irony). Yelchin does a good Michael Biehn impression, but the circumstances in which his Kyle Reese are placed are ridiculous and cannot be ignored by even the most forgiving, disbelief suspending film fan. Put simply, if Skynet knows Reese is the father of the man leading the resistance, why not just kill him straightaway instead of capturing him? <br/><br/>This question is never answered, and the lack of explanation is just one facet of the lazy film-making on display. Another issue is one that plagues many wannabe apocalypse films, at least those made by untalented hacks. That is, while these people have been fighting for the existence of humanity for 15 years, many of them still look like they've stepped out of a Clairol ad. The nuclear holocaust must come with a great dental plan, because most everyone has perfect teeth. A small gripe perhaps, but reflective of the uninspired ""blockbuster"" nature of the proceedings.<br/><br/>Murderous machines or no, these plucky fighters have also managed to build a high-tech air force and a super cool submarine command center, while helicopters flit through the sky and buzz bomb unsuspecting robo-assassins. Remember that scene from T2 where Skynet's Harrier- like hunter/killer aircraft overpower the resistance's puny jeeps and outdated weaponry and the terminator robots actually seemed menacing? All of that sense of menace and danger is missing here. Not only do the good guys have awesome weapons, they also possess communications technology that allows one man to broadcast via radio to freedom fighters all over the country, if not the world. The horrifying, hardscrabble future portended in the first two Terminator movies is not so bleak after all, it seems.<br/><br/>The future of the Terminator series is cloudy, although McG has said he wants to make T5, and the end of Salvation certainly leaves things open for another sequel or two. My hope is that Cameron, finally finished with ""Avatar,"" brings his storytelling vision back to the franchise, while McG goes back to making music videos."

It was totally not the kind of film I would have chosen on my own, but within a half hour I was totally sucked into the story and by the time the credits rolled it was ranked in my top 3 films. I told everyone I knew how great it was, I even got my mom to buy me the VHS tape when it was available! Terminator 2 blew me away, plain and simple. I bought books and fan magazines, I started working out trying to get guns like Sarah Connor's, I was a die hard fan.<br/><br/>I was worried about T3, but unlike most people, in the end I loved it. I agree that of the trilogy, it is the weakest and sure there's a lot of things wrong with it, but I love the story, I love the end. I was completely gratified by the turnaround from the ""no fate but what you make"" theme, because I happen to agree with what's shown at the end of T3, you can't escape destiny, even when you think you know what's coming. When the credits on T3 rolled, I was 100% satisfied with the 3 movies as a whole, and happy with the way the franchise had wrapped everything up and put a bow on top.<br/><br/>So, I was not happy to hear about a 4th film, I felt it was unnecessary. However, I was willing to approach it with an open mind after the way T3 had totally exceeded my expectations. What. A. Joke. Aside from the multiple plot points that totally go against the history of the franchise...a heart transplant? Really? Come on, people. You don't even have antibiotics. And then ending it with Connor saying ""There's no fate but what you make?"" Umm..hello? Did you not learn a hard lesson on judgment day about not being able to change fate? Really the only good thing about this film was lots of whiz bang special effects, but that's not the heart and soul of the Terminator movies. This movie has neither & actually needed someone to give it the stupid heart transplant that Connor gets in the end."

There was no character development and by far Sam Worthington gave the best performance. All the CGI in the world couldn't save this pre-destined failure.

","Not as bad as I was expecting it to be but certainly the worst TERMINATOR movie (yet). SALVATION has got the action, the chases and the explosions but one really couldn't care less about the characters with the women being the very worst (what was the point of bringing Jane Alexander out of retirement for a bland two minute role?). It's good to know though that in the near apocalyptic future the women are still hot and shampoo is available in abundance (Bloodgood) as is makeup (Howard). And for me, the most annoying & recent trend from these movies: in I and II you just knew that if the Terminators got within a hair of their targets they were most likely toast, now in III and specially in IV they get to John Connor, grab his shirt, throw him into the air while he miraculously lands on a soft surface, unfortunately for Skynet these more recent Terminators are too dumb to figure out this isn't going to get the job done anytime soon. No wonder the sense of excitement has pretty much gone from this series."
"indyfreak51","1","14","25","15 March 2011"," The worst in the series
","I absolutely love the first two Terminator movies, and the 3rd one wasn't very good. When I found out that they were making another one, I thought, ""This better be good"". And I saw this movie and I said to myself when it ended, ""What is the garbage?"". Let me break it down for you guys.<br/><br/>The director of this movie is McG, who directed the Charlie's Angels movies. The first one was good, second one being and OK movie. And he does music videos. And this seemed like one of his music videos, but in a bad way. The movie opens up with Marcus Wright (Sam Worthington) being sentenced to death. But before this happens, a chick that has cancer who works at Cyberdine (Helena Bonham Carter) has him sign these papers. Marcus gets put to death by lethal injection, and then it goes to the year 2018. John Connor (Christian Bale) infiltrates a Skynet base where he discovers the plan to make the human Terminators. And it shows that Marcus wakes up butt naked in this era, and he tries to find his way through this mess. And along the way, Marcus meets Kyle Reese (Anton Yelchin) and this little black girl who doesn't say anything once so ever. And John finds out that the machines want to kill Kyle to ensure that John Connor won't be born.<br/><br/>This movie's plot jumped around a lot that it went by too fast. And the robots had a plan where they collected these people, and they didn't explain much of it. The visual effects on the robots are amazing, but they did something that wasn't forgivable. They had a dude who has Arnold's face CGI on there. It was the stupidest looking thing on the planet. It was the stupidest thing I have ever seen in an action flick. And the ending of the movie was predictable. I already knew Marcus was gonna save John from dying by giving him his heart... literally. And Christian Bale used his Batman voice for John Connor and it seemed very awkward to watch. Not only is this the worst in the series, but it's one of the worst movies I have seen in a long time. Don't see this movie."

","Yet again, the critics are extremely wrong. They say it doesn't have a plot: but yet the story is strong enough to sustain throughout the movie and keeping interest. The set-up for this movie may seem dour, but it is effective with smarter ideas than transformers ever came up with. Christian Bale and Sam Worthington were a partnership only imagined in heaven- but in this, they are so focused and convincingly dedicated. Even though they have few scenes together, this can stop each other outperforming each other, a fault made in the Dark Knight and the Devi Wears Prada. The special effects are amazing, with Anton Yelchin giving another great performance since Star Trek. I enjoyed this film by walking in with an optimistic view and with the expectation to only be entertained. I was not expecting 'James Cameron' masterpiece. The soundtrack must be mentioned and praised- clearly one of the best soundtracks of the year. It's main competition being the okay Transformers sequel- so I say see Terminator Salvation if you just want to enjoy yourself and have a good time. People will enjoy this movie- what more can you ask? Similar to the reviews Australia earned- watch the movie for what it is, not what it should've been.

","With these kinds of movies, if you get the world wrong, then the whole thing falls apart. You need the definition of the alternative world, because the differences between it and what we know is where the agency of the story comes from. ""Fifth Element"" was basically banal, but it worked well because we knew the world, we saw the differences and we saw how they were leveraged in the story and cinematic elements.<br/><br/>The world in this thing is all wrong. Whoever imagined it thought that piles of rubble, with predictably spaced fires (fires?) would do it. For the long shots, you had to have fire as well, so just use the same sorts of flares Ridley Scott used in ""Bladerunner,"" because — so he says — he simply had no money. They thought that an oblique allusion to Jesus would substitute for the more powerful notion of entangled causality and plastic time from the earlier installments.<br/><br/>Since it is simply a loud, boring rehash of old bits, the viewer is free to ramble.<br/><br/>The overlaps with real life? As it happens, the reference to robots that look like humans but which are mechanical ""inside"" is already something that has moved outside the movie imagination and is accepted as real by most. Add in the face of a governor and there is a sort of folding here. Not directed, not effective, but clearly engineered.<br/><br/>Its the notion of the conspiracy that intrigues me. Usually in this brand of science fiction some large part of the permanent world is determined to mess up the lives of the players we focus on. This interests me because it extends and leverages that peculiar cinematic trend of noir: that the existence of what we see as a film, literally creates the dynamics we see, shaped not because they make sense in the world, but that they make sense for a cinematic narrative. Coincidences happen. Forces arrange themselves. Knowledge is sculpted.<br/><br/>It helps when the world of the conspiracy is complex. Here, it is not. There are machines. They do what appears to be nothing at all except hunt humans. There is no world- creation, no cosmic urge other than that. Even Marvel comics does better than that.<br/><br/>The only elaboration is the apparent plot to trick a man-machine into believing he is a man with free will, only to discover that — initially at least — he is not. But he gains his humanity in such an uninteresting tin man sort of way, you will cringe.<br/><br/>McG usually has a lighter, more complex touch. He does have one scene in the beginning where Connor's fight in a helicopter has the camera affixed to the frame of the copter. It is buffeted, and inverted.

","Remember those flash forward's of laser warfare in a post apocalyptic dreamscape of man vs machine? Do you remember seeing the Terminator tanks rolling over the skulls of long dead humans? That was not this movie. All the years of looking forward to seeing a futuristic battle of Cyborgs vs Man... Well..This film didn't deliver. It was as if the writer, didn't even watch the first three films.<br/><br/>Of course there is the thought that another few movies are to come.. Why does it have to be a business? Lets make a teaser movie to real them in for the next bad movie, and once society is so used to bad movies, perhaps we can pump out something that was marginally better and everyone will rave about it? Not me. This film sucked. The nuts and bolts and guts that the first two movies had, this one lacked. Part three, though not as good as the first two, was monumentally better than Salvation.<br/><br/>In fact. I cant think of a movie I disliked more. Even the most recent Stephen Segal flick where he is dicing up vampires with a frickin sword was better than this steaming pile of fail.<br/><br/>For the record, when I like a movie, Ill go and more times than not, go again. In the newest Star Trek film, I went 3 times, and will buy it. This T4 Salvation movie, not only will I boycott everything that has to do with it, Ill urge everyone I know to avoid it like the smelly backyard landmine that it is...<br/><br/>Hey guys... don't step over there!

"colinrgeorge","3","21","41","6 April 2010"," ""Terminator Salvation""
","McG's ""Terminator Salvation"" is full of paradoxes, and not just the brain bending, time traveling, series continuity kind, but also the stilted decision-making, lapses in logic, flawed design kind. The director, most well known for the two ""Charlie's Angels"" films, trades estrogen for an excess in testosterone, treating the ""Terminator"" franchise as an exercise in antithesis.<br/><br/>In fact, there's only about four women in the entire movie, none of whom are particularly flattering characters. The most likable by default is Bryce Dallas Howard as Kate Connor, resistance soldier and maybe-savior John Connor's pregnant wife, as she's given almost nothing to do. Then there's Dr. Serena Kogan (Helena Bonham Carter), the face of Skynet, so she's bad. Third and worst, though through no fault of her own, is Moon Bloodgood as Blair Williams, whose arbitrary and apparently passionate attraction to a half-man/half- terminator turns her against her allies. Last is Jadagrace (?) as the young Star, a shy (or mute) little girl whose sole purpose seems to be projecting a lone beacon of cute onto the wasteland of washed-out deserts and deserted, leveled cities.<br/><br/>Okay, there may be a couple more women here and there, but they're few and far between in this future dominated by grunting, screaming men. The story begins in 2003, with death row inmate Marcus Wright (Sam Worthington) being offered a second chance at life through cybernetics. Though he knows he should embrace death for the crimes he's committed, he agrees to sell the good doctor his body for a price--one kiss. He's then carted off and his sentence carried out via lethal injection in a scene ripped straight from ""Dead Man Walking.""<br/><br/>Enter the future. 2018. Wright appears naked and conveniently near a man with just what he needs. Clothed, he begins his trek toward the nearest city, where he encounters Kyle Reese (Anton Yelchin), and the ever-adorable Star. Since Wright has the technical knowhow to fix the duo's busted radio, they intercept one of Connor's transmissions and set out to find him.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the resistance is testing its latest weapon, a signal that powers down any terminators within its wavelength. The higher-ups are ready to launch a coordinated strike on Skynet when Connor learns from Wright that Reese (Connor's father, long story) has been taken prisoner and is being held at one of the targeted facilities.<br/><br/>It's no wonder Bale freaked out at that Director of Photography in the infamous leaked clip a few months back, as nearly every one of his scenes necessitates one of maybe six permutations of anger. The character of Connor lacks depth on the page, but Bale's performance is bludgeoningly one-note, and in that way, perfectly matched with Worthington; the two speak almost identically. One particular shot of them nose to nose in interrogation makes this amusingly apparent as they volley gruff monosyllabic responses and spittle-projecting barks back and forth.<br/><br/>The film also suffers from an antagonist identity crisis. Are we rooting for Wright, as he tries to escape from Connor? Are we rooting for Connor, who testifies to the worth of every human life, only to watch the generals with whom he disagrees decimated in battle? Or is it just the infinite waves of machines?<br/><br/>McG clearly has a vision for the future of the Terminator franchise (Army recruitment video by way of the apocalypse), but ""Salvation"" is blisteringly melodramatic and above all, commits the cardinal sin of summer action films--it bores. Things explode, and if the audience can keep track of who's fighting who or why, they certainly won't care on any intimate level. It's the equivalent of a two-plus-hour fireworks show, except the fireworks are only two colors, black and bleached-white.<br/><br/>It's obvious every moment is designed to positively drip masculine coolness, but it often comes off like the kid in school who just wants to fit in and tries a little bit too hard. The film is terrified of letting itself be mindless fun, even for a moment, and so packs on the doomsday pretension. The work may be a step toward credibility for the auspiciously named director, but as a standalone piece, ""Terminator Salvation"" is an indulgent, groaningly operatic mess that chokes on its own testosterone."

","I must admit, that I voted this a 1 not so much on its own merits, but that it dawned the headdress of the Terminator series and in so doing, dealt a deathblow to one of the great franchises in recent Hollywood history.<br/><br/>This is not a good movie, but it is a terrible Terminator flick.<br/><br/>It's got some interesting chase scenes, tons of explosions and without a doubt, the best CG of the series.<br/><br/>But it is rife with cliché, both in plot and dialogue. And not that the previous ones were cliché-free, but the tension, creativity and vision of the first two especially, carried them past some of the lesser portions (let us not forget the ""I need a vacation"" line from T2 - probably not in character to say the least.) This one just goes along, meandering in between unbelievable contrived situations, explosions and winks at superfans (and let me tell you, I was winked upon so often I figured McG to have Tourette's Syndrome) And PG-13... come on... Terminator? PG-13? The tightness of plot in the first 2 especially (which basically amounted to 2 extended chase sequences) led to tension, cohesion and a basic redoubling of stakes as the films progressed. This one is a mess plot-wise, it starts in a completely unnecessary scene which only serves to undermine a later reveal in T4: So Arnold's Not in This One? and clumsily reaches as heavy-handed a redemption for an anti-hero as you're ever going to see.<br/><br/>Skip it, like the Godfather series, just show your kids the first 2 and mention the rest in that sort of, ""Yeah, he's your creepy uncle Benjamin"" way."

","McG did an outstanding job of bringing a unique vision to the Terminator franchise. As a major fan of the Terminator saga I didn't expect much since I wasn't familiar with any of the previous work of McG and I had read little of the plot--though I was happy to know Christian Bale was playing John Connor.<br/><br/>I'm so glad I saw it on the big screen! The sound and visuals were amazing from start to finish. The story was refreshingly layered and the dialogue was sharp. Don't expect any cheesy scenes or unconvincing acting to ruin the mood--something I felt happened too often in Part 3. Bale and Yelchin were believable as Connor and Reese. Worthington's performance was perfectly executed and perhaps worthy of top billing.<br/><br/>After Part 3, regardless of its shortcomings, I hoped for a part 4. Certainly, with what we are told and what is shown in flashbacks in the first 3 films, a film centered on a world post Judgment Day could be action packed. Yet action and special effects should serve the story and not the other way around. In Terminator Salvation there is no lack of story, no lack of action, and certainly no lack of brilliant direction. Well done McG! Please come back. For Part 5? Possibly. . . ."

","I went into this movie with a 'blah' state of mind. I didn't think it was going to be all that great and I was worried that McG would turn the movie into ""Tnsformers"" and make the action so fast paced that it would be hard to follow. Or that it would be ""Charlies Angels"" Terminator style. Nope. This movie was frickin awesome! Well cast, well acted, great story line and while watching it all I could think of was, ""This is Apocalypse Now set in 2018 with robots in place of the Vietcong."" Hands down this was the best movie I've seen this summer. It beat the pants off ""X-Men"" and ""Star Trek"" combined. Christian Bale got his Batman voice going a few times but for the most part it didn't matter. The series could end now (with no need for the 5th one already in the works) because it came full circle. Go see it!"
"griffolyon12","6","16","30","21 May 2009"," Is the Rebirth of the Terminator Franchise what many were Hoping For?
","When many people think of action movies, the Terminator films are usually among the first to cross the mind. The Jim Cameron creation is synonymous with both the action and science fiction genre. Now I never thought that there should have been another Terminator after the third film, then I heard that they were making a fourth and were planning to have it take place post-Judgment Day. Now I never really felt we needed to see what happens after Judgment Day, the little we saw in previous movies was enough for me, but lo-and-behold a fourth film was made. Terminator Salvation is the fourth film in this classic franchise, the main question is whether it manages to live up to its lofty name? Sad to say the answer is not exactly what one would expect.<br/><br/>While Terminator Salvation is not a horrible film, it just lacks any real characters or an intriguing story. The characters in this film are two-dimensional, a large part of this is due to the fact that the script is constantly switching back-and-forth amongst the multiple characters, never truly taking the time to develop any of these said characters. Due to this fact it is often hard to tell who the true protagonist is; Kyle Reese, Marcus Wright, and John Connor all have the same amount of screen time, and depending upon your view any one of them can be the protagonist. Perhaps the weak characters can explain the so-so acting, which is sad cause the film is chock full of terrific actors. Christian Bale was never given anything to work with as John Connor and comes off as just an angry uncle; Sam Worthington as Marcus Wright has moments of near brilliance, but the scenes usually end before he can reach it; and Anton Yelchin as Kyle Reese is the only one who manages to break out past the rest and stand out, all simply cause his character is the closest any character in the film comes to having three dimensions. Still, rocky characters can be overlooked with a dynamite story, but sadly the story is not too much better. The story is chock full of good ideas, but the execution of these said ideas is not exactly what one would hope for; what these ideas needed was more development in the pattern of the story to truly come to fruition. If only the film ever slowed down long enough to take a breath perhaps we might have ended up with a genuine classic, but instead the film tries to rely on subtlety without any development within the story and the characters.<br/><br/>Now while I may have some problems with the story and the characters, I must say that the action in the film is good overall. This is by far the most entertained I have been by this type of meat-and-potatoes action movie in a long time. Throw in some awesome special effects and an amazing cameo from Arnold, and the film has the makings of a terrific summer blockbuster but ultimately it fell flat.<br/><br/>Terminator Salvation in the end had tremendous ambition, the entire time you're watching this film you see where they wanted go, but it never seemed to get all the way to the top. Perhaps just one more rewrite of the script could have fixed my quibbles with the film, cause despite a weak story and characters, the film's action and special effects are truly superb. All-in-all it simply boils down to what you want when you go to see a movie. If all you want is great action and big explosions, then this film is for you, but if you happen to want just a little bit more from a film, or if you happen to be a big fan of the Terminator franchise, you may ultimately come away disappointed.<br/><br/>I give Terminator Salvation a slightly disappointing 6 out of 10!"

","Most of the characters in the movie did not form a sentence more than once. They just kept nodding, smiling and winking the whole movie! Either writers blew it or I missed a scene where someone explained individuals don't need to talk in 2018. Also, I must say Christian Bale was not his best here. In fact, I think his worst acting performance in 00s. He did not seem to believe in his character. In fact, no one seemed to believe in the story. <br/><br/>Note to McG, director: Dude, no one will take you serious with a nickname. I know how you feel. Its cool to have a nickname, you get to become a gangsta. But imagine yourself meeting with Steven Spielberg or James Cameron as, ""Hi, I am McG. M & G uppercase."" Still, you don't have to give up on McG. Use it when you play Counter-Stike.<br/><br/>*** By the way, IMDb movie ratings losing its credibility.

"tankace","7","5","7","21 May 2017"," The possibility was there but they just couldn't do it!
","Terminator Salvation is on papers an excellent idea, the back story of how the resistance manage to send Kyle Reese back in time in order for the events of the first film to take place.<br/><br/>And to be honest the effects and battle scenes are very well made and compared with Terminator 3 and Genisys, it is a far better film from both in both characters and action. But there is the elephant in the room which is that the action scenes are few and far between, most of the characters are paper-thin and the story is quit jangled. <br/><br/>In all honesty the film could have been really enjoyable, if they focused more in the current (before time travel) movie environment, we might had something like Rogue One, but history is not written with ifs and the huge issues of production and studio intervention dammed the project. Christian Bale reputation might suffered the worst due to a break down he had in the set, but let's be real we all faced a disappointing project ,which is stress-full, exhausting and irritating and few of us in some point we screamed and cursed our lungs out because of that, so Mr. Bale is not here to blame for that mess!!<br/><br/>In the end Salvation is for me the point where everyone must understand that the Terminator franchise has no stem anymore and any idea for a sequel, prequel , etc. must be deleted and try something else that works."

","The first three TERMINATOR movies were all time-traveling capers in their respective eras of 1984, 1997, and 2003. Here, finally, in TERMINATOR SALVATION, we get to see the war between man and machine in the dusty post-apocalyptic year of 2018. John Connor (Christian Bale) is a soldier in the human resistance movement. Not yet the leader, he inevitably takes it upon himself to track down a very young Kyle Reese (the late great Anton Yelchin), who will one day turn out to be his father. Meanwhile, a mysterious man (Sam Worthington) wakes up in an underground facility that the resistance fighters come across. Traveling through the barren wasteland, he soon learns of his origins and purpose. Admittedly, the plot is virtually a shoestring, keeping the events loosely tied together. But that's fine, because the real strong points are the spectacular and epic battles on display here. And yes, fans of the series, Arnold Schwarzenegger DOES make an appearance in this film. While some have felt that this movie was a let-down, I disagree. In fact, this is the movie that TERMINATOR 3 should've been!"
"stevegc","6","5","7","20 February 2011"," Please cast Moon Bloodgood in more movies!
","The year is 2018. Judgment day has come and gone leaving humanity in the hands of a few, scattered resistance fighters. Various terminator models roam the post-apocalyptic wasteland either killing or harvesting humans all under the direction of a faceless, computer enemy known as Skynet. And the salvation of the human race rests in the hands of one man ... John Connor.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, this plays out more as a guilty pleasure movie than a canonical extension of the James Cameron Terminator series. If the first movie was about saving Sarah Connor, and the second movie was about saving John Connor, this installment seems to be about saving Kyle Reese. This is where the holes in the story begin with me. How does Skynet know about the relationship between Kyle Reese and John Connor? I can understand that they know about John Connor from his FDR style fireside chats over the radio as the leader of the resistance. But how would they know about his relationship with Kyle Reese? Kyle Reese and the T-800 are sent back in time in the year 2029 and yet this is only 2018.<br/><br/>In the first Terminator movie Kyle Reese assesses the conflict between man and machine in the following quote, ""That terminator is out there. It can't be bargained with. It can't be reasoned with. It doesn't feel pity, or remorse, or fear. And it absolutely will not stop, ever, until you are dead."" That context helps build the tension in the first 2 movies. Whereas the conflict in this installment is full of less tension because it seems Skynet is content to leave the resistance to its own devices while it's busy in the lab working on schemes. There are no scenes like in the first movie where we see terminators infiltrating resistance camps. That would have been cool. Interesting side note, Arnold's workout buddy Franco Columbo plays the terminator infiltrator that shoots up the resistance camp in Kyle Reese's flash back sequence in the first terminator movie.<br/><br/>Influences and flaws: MCG cites such movies as Black Hawk Down, Children of Men, and Road Warrior as influences for this movie. In reality, this movie plays out more like a thinly veiled rip off of those movies while managing to never come close to catching the authenticity or originality of any of those movies.<br/><br/>That's probably my biggest complaint about this movie is that there's nothing original about it at all. It's just a rehash of old clichés. Why there's even the cliché post-apocalyptic child, same archetype child as found in the Road Warrior, old Star Trek reruns (Bop!), or Aliens. I half expected her to say ... ""The Terminators mostly come out at night, mostly."" The 60 foot tall harvesters are right out of the movie War of the Worlds. Even the sounds they make are exactly the same as Spielberg's alien harvesters in War of the Worlds. The air battles in the canyons are played out. The terminator motorcycles are straight out of Road Warrior and in fact the entire high way sequence is straight out of Road warrior. The acceptance of Terminators as allies and even mentors for young would be resistance leaders (in this case, Kyle Reese) and not just enemies was already introduced in T2. The final sequences take place at an industrial plant and plays out exactly like the ending of T2. cough, cough, HACK! All the call backs to the original material in the form of ""i'll be back"" and ""Come with me if you want to live"" felt cheesy instead of inciting nerd nirvana like the call backs did in the recent Star Trek movie.<br/><br/>Maybe my problem is that I've seen too many movies and my expectations are set a little high. Or maybe MCG is a hack and this movie should have been held to a higher standard. Nevertheless it feels like they're just cashing in on the Terminator name.<br/><br/>Other franchises have been successfully rebooted such as Hulk, Batman and James Bond. I think in those cases, the source material needed a bit of freshness to appeal to modern audiences. This attempt at rebooting falls flat and lacks the fresh approach necessary to over shadow the source material. James Cameron casts a giant shadow. This movie plays out more like a made for TV sci-fi channel attempt at capitalizing on the franchise name instead of a true reboot of the franchise. Being a fan of the series, it was fun to see the T-600 walking around like zombies ineptly attempting to kill humans. But beyond serving up more endoskeleton murder machines walking around with ""crush, kill, destroy"" on their little tiny robot brains, this movie doesn't offer much.<br/><br/>Characters: A bright spot among the acting was new comer Sam Worthington who plays Marcus Wright. We find out that Marcus Wright is a prototype cyborg used by Cyberdyne systems to infiltrate the human resistance. That is something I would have preferred to find out in the middle of the movie when it's revealed rather than in the TRAILER!!!!!!! Because really that's the only twist in this movie. Other bright spots are Moon Bloodgood who plays a fighter in the resistance and Anton Yelchin who plays Kyle Reese. All the other performances, including Christian Bale who seems to be phoning this one in with his Batman voice, fall flat.<br/><br/>""Are you not entertained?"" A very qualified yes. It's not so much that I dislike this movie as I think it's forgettable. Really, once you've seen this movie, there won't be any scenes that you'll be talking about with your friends afterwards.<br/><br/>If you're interested in this movie, you should also check out ...

","I had never walked out on a movie before Terminator Salvation. There is simply nothing positive to say about the latest installment, least of which the casting, acting and plot in general. Certainly Christian Bale's worst performance to date. He seemed to have difficulty controlling the volume of his voice. The most frustrating thing about this flick is that there was so much potential to revitalize the franchise after the train wreck that was the third Terminator film. It's a shame that production companies are too preoccupied with raking in box office dollars then actually producing a good film. But I suppose that is the standard these days. Salvation had its moments (albeit only a couple action sequences that were far too short), but the scenes jumped around within themselves far too much with little explanation to the goings-on. The self proclaimed ""McG"" should stick to developing horrible teenage dramas like the OC, because he certainly did a fine job tearing apart what could have been an amazing story. I can't imagine James Cameron is impressed, and neither should the movie-going public. To those on this forum praising Salvation, you must have watched a different film. I certainly wish I did."
"Velociraptor256","3","9","15","4 September 2010"," Easily the worst Terminator film, if you can even call it that
","There are two main problems with Terminator Salvation. First, it's boring. Aside from a Terminator-against-Terminator fight that takes place towards the end, the action is very uninspired, and little of what goes on outside the action scenes is terribly interesting. Say what you will about Terminator 3, but at least that film was reasonably entertaining.<br/><br/>Second, it doesn't fit in well with the Terminator franchise. It's drab and sterile compared to the other films, and though it can be argued that a post-apocalyptic film is supposed to be like that, even the brief clips of the future from the previous films had an atmosphere to them, which is lacking here. And some things don't make sense when you consider the franchise's history, either: for example, in the first film, Kyle Reese said that most records were lost in the war - so in this film, why does Skynet have a whole database of old news reports, and how does it know that Reese is John Connor's father anyway? Thus, when we hear Connor say ""I'll be back"" and then play 'You Could Be Mine' on the radio, it doesn't feel like a respectful homage - it just seems awkward and out of place.<br/><br/>As an action film, Terminator Salvation fails - and as a Terminator film, it really fails."

","I wasn't expecting much with SALVATION . I thought it was going to be a rather dumb Summer blockbuster full of set-pieces and explosions without the cerebral poetry and impacting imagery that Cameron and Ellison brought to the original just over 25 years ago .. In fact the scene where Kyle remembers the future where traumatised survivors huddle in underground bunkers scavenging for rats and using TV sets as fireplaces is one of the most stunning scenes in the history of post apocalyptic cinema . None of the other films including the over rated sequel come close to this so what hope for SALVATION ? <br/><br/>!!!!! SUGGESTIVE SPOILERS !!!!!!<br/><br/>As I expected SALVATION plays out in a predictable manner . The only real surprise was that John Connor played by Christian Bale wasn't really the main character but was Marcus Wright played by Sam Worthington . Marcus has a dark secret but you'll be able to work out what it is long before it's revealed on screen . The only other real surprise is that there's so much action on show but this is to the detriment of everything else . For example if someone falls out of a helicopter in to a lake it's not enough that they swim for their life , they must engage in combat with Terminators . If you look at the trivia section on this page you'll see that several screenwriters were brought in to polish the script including Oscar winner Paul Haggis but one has to ask what they did to develop the story ? Did they cross out their colleagues work and pile on their own set-pieces in to the screenplay ? You're left with that impression <br/><br/>There's also a serious gap in logic in having so much action . In the original humanity is on its last legs but here the Human resistance has ample supplies of things like aircraft and helicopters . Considering humanity had been nuked many years ago how on earth are they able to refine the fuel for all these aircraft . As someone who grew up during the cold war the thought of surviving World War 3 terrified me more than dying in it . You can understand artistic licence in that radation sickness being ignored but when you've got a film where post apocalyptic field hospital can still carry out intricate heart surgery then someone on the production may be in need of a brain transplant <br/><br/>That said I did find SALVATION slightly better than RISE OF THE MACHINES and the cinematography is impressive as is the CGI and special effects ,. But it doesn't really have much more of a function than as a cynical money making excersise . I've recently seen all of the Universal FRANKENSTEIN films which ended up with introducing Dracula and the Wolf Man in to the series and you've got the nasty feeling that the next TERMINATOR movie might see a few Predators or Aliens get thrown in to the mix"

It took another over-hyped film The Dark Knight to make people even notice he existed.<br/><br/>Lots of the stupid nonsense in this movie is, of course, listed in other reviews here but I've got to mention them anyway.<br/><br/>This movie temporarily turned into Transformers when the giant robot came out of nowhere and began stomping things. Why are they collecting people? Why do Terminators struggle to get a hold of someone, TOSS THEM AWAY and then try to get them again? Does that make sense? Why do they have robot/motorcycles that crash all the time and have HUMAN CONTROLS? Bale gets on one and rides it away, so it must have steering and a shifter for humans.

","As a regular movie goer one would expect some story, good screenplay that would engage the audience. I expected some gripping sequences, and entertaining plot when I entered the theater. Guess what? This is a pathetic movie with lazy direction, awful story and poor execution. Come on! Hollywood has great amount of resources -- money, technology, technicians, actors and last but not least damn good writers and directors. When a movie like Terminator (sequel) is being made there should be commitment from the makers, at least. What does this movie have? Nothing new at all. Normal sequences are replaced with ""great"" video game graphics, predictable plot which even a kid would be able to guess which makes the audience leave theater with utter disappointment. Same SanDisk USB available now in market is being shown as used in 2018. The watchman robot behaves pretty much same as a normal human watchman which we have seen umpteen times in old movies. Robots' technology has so improved that they do not trace down Connor's communication -- which is Radio with some sh*t frequency!! Does this sound like an EFFORT from makers? Sloppy, negligent and careless work. This movie doesn't deserve the current rating of 7+. For it's sheer crap it deserves nothing more than a zero which we don't have as an option. So I give 1 out of 10."

","McG wasn't the right guy for this film. Simple. The short comings of the storyline and script are just from a lack of experience, or arrogance. The film looks amazing, that's the DP work, and it looks like the end of the world. The film is too safe. The original film focus on Marcus sounded more interesting, that would ensure the prophet and legend of John Connor stayed in the background. There's a lot of well staged action, but it's surrounded by dull story beats. A writer and director like Cameron is a tough act to follow, so I'm amazed all these filmmakers attempt to recreate the series, it should've ended with Judgement Day, or Cameron should've done number 3. This failed to connect and as a fan it's easy to see why. I disliked it more on release, but I think it's not as horrible as I remembered. It's just not a Terminator film."

","In 2003 Marcus Wright (Sam Worthington) is on death row, and donates his body to research. Years later after Skynet has taken over, John Connor (Christian Bale) is just one of the fighters against the machines. When he attacks a Skynet facility, he finds that Skynet is developing the powerful new model T-800. He seems to be the sole survivor, but unbeknownst to him, a naked Marcus emerges.<br/><br/>This is the war movie that everybody expected after the first Terminator movie came out. We all thought about the apocalyptic world of battling Skynet. The movies have always been pre-Judgement day. This is the first movie post-Judgement day.<br/><br/>The CG has finally caught up to the vision. The action is dark, and big as it should be. The story is too complicated for it's own good.

"Plummer2512","7","17","34","19 May 2009"," Terminator Good but not Great
","I saw a special sneak screening yesterday in CT and while I very much liked the new installment it wasn't great. While better than part 3 it pales in comparison to parts 1 & 2. We finally get the war between the humans and machines but it feels rushed at points and the believability goes way out the window in some scenes. <br/><br/>First off let me start by saying, McG does a pretty good job directing and I can honestly say this doesn't seem like a McG film. It's gritty, dark at times and very loyal to the Terminator series. There seemed to be a lot trimmed out of this film as well. SPOILER ALERT from here on out. Side stories between Marcus and Blair's (Moon Bloodgood)romance were trimmed as well as John and Kate's obvious pregnancy. This was probably not McG's fault as he probably had a lot more but cuts were either due to runtime or to get a PG-13 rating.<br/><br/>THE BAD! - I guess my biggest beef with the whole movie and the one thing that keeps it great is the ending. The believability of a veterinarian performing open heart surgery to save John was baffling. I know its been 15 years into the future but the fact still is that she is a veterinarian and with very primitive medical equipment.<br/><br/><ul><li>The rushed scenes as stated before.</li></ul><br/><br/>THE GOOD! - The gritty and at times dark action scenes. These were very well done and felt like you were part of the action. Seemed like a real war was going on in the film.<br/><br/><ul><li>The CGI! Great job with all the terminators and the interactions with the real actors. Even Arnold's cameo was nicely done. While you can def. tell its a CGI face its done much better than in past movies such as The Mummy 2. They also do it right with only showing it a couple of times.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The Story! Great story and the whole Marcus terminator thing kicks serious butt. I wish they went into more detail on how he was built but then again how do you do that while not ruining the whole mood of the movie with the is he good/is he bad thing.</li></ul><br/><br/>Overall I'd give it a solid 7.5/10 and a very good jump start to the new trilogy. I can't wait to see what McG and Bale have it store for the next one!!"
"battler1569","1","19","39","3 June 2009"," Abysmal Film
","Terminator Salvation is a god awful addition to the Terminator saga. The movie lacked the tone, subsistence, and overall quality of the Cameron originals. The acting was sub par at best is it me or did Christian Bale sound like Batman rather than what you would expect John Connor to sound like. The new character Marcus Wright was boring and very little explanation is given for his choosing to side resistance. The humans tortured him the machines did not why not side with the machines. I have waited to see the war between the Humans and Skynet since I first saw Terminator when I was 7 years old. I was left totally unimpressed by the ""battle scenes"", which I can hardly call battle scenes given that there was very little tactical significance to anything the resistance or skynet did throughout the film. The look of the film was thoroughly unimpressive I found that the only scene that impressed me was seen in the trailer. When the best scene is in the trailer the movie truly sucks. The scene I am referring to is the image of skynet's camp for human prisoners. The tone of the film was completely off, I always imagined the future being set primarily at night (as seen in Terminator 1), in this film most of the action takes place during the day and is hokey and campy to boot. This film felt like an Indiana Jones movie rather than a Terminator film this is probably do to the fact the screen writers and directors were more concerned with making a terminator film rather than telling a compelling terminator story. The only saving grace was the scene in which Guns and Roses You could be mine was played and of course the digital Arnold T-800. One scene I believe totally sank the movie was when Kyle Reese was captured (by the giant terminator) and not immediately killed. Anyone that has ever seen a good Terminator movie would tell you that a Terminator would not be that stupid. Hopefully Terminator 5 makes up for this travesty and the plot hole riddled travesty that was Terminator 3."
"jaredmobarak","7","19","39","19 May 2009"," So that's what death tastes like  Terminator Salvation
","You do not need to be aware of the television show ""The Sarah Connor Chronicles"" at all, and frankly don't need to know too much about the original trilogy either. Salvation amps up the action, brings in some pretty good talent to perform, and gets the aesthetic of post-Judgment Day perfect. Unfortunately, for all that it succeeds to accomplish, there is one glaring problem—the story is very thin. With action scenes and explosions filling the screen at a rapid pace, story is pushed to the back, making the film very much an opening to a larger tale. When put alongside the future installments, (there is no way this tanks to the point the money isn't there for more), it may all work perfectly. Watching as a film on its own just shows a fantastic surface with a weak interior heart.<br/><br/>I use the simile with the heart because of how important that muscle is for character Marcus Wright. The film opens with his lethal injection in 2003, allowing us to see him sign away his body to a very creepy, cancer-ridden Helena Bonham Carter. The blatant, ham-fisted script pushes its agenda of second chances right from the start and never stops. Nor does it let up on the fact that Marcus' heart is very strong, a pulsing that comforts Moon Bloodgood's Blair Williams as she rests her head against his chest in 2018. Wait  2018? I thought he died in prison fifteen years earlier? Well, what would a Terminator movie be without a Terminator? Salvation uses the character of Marcus Wright much to the same effect that ""Battlestar Galactica"" used the skin-job cylons: a combination of machine and biology, one who's consciousness stills holds the humanity necessary to make choices in his actions. Because, of course, the true sign of what sets a human apart from machine is its heart.<br/><br/>Besides Wright's awakening, the film concerns the evolution of John Connor and his place in the Resistance. A rogue voice commanding the masses, as people listen to him because of the rumors and speculation they have heard, Connor is not a general, nor is he universally loved. Many believe him to be a false prophet, not worth the time or effort, despite the eventual discovery of things that he had spoken of years before. One major plus in Salvation, though, is that his teacher and mother Sarah Connor didn't know everything; the future seems to have changed. A creature such as Marcus was never fathomed before. The fact that time travel has been occurring for the past three decades in attempts to eradicate John and to save him means that the timeline has been altered. Somewhere along the line the machines discovered their failures and advanced their AI to create the ultimate infiltrator—half man/half machine. However, this weapon is awakened before ready, an outcome caused by Connor's arrival on a mission to the Skynet laboratory, a mission that ends with the destruction of everything in sight, besides Connor and Wright, therefore setting them on a collision course.<br/><br/>Wright goes on a journey to find the one person that might be able to explain why he is alive, Bonham Carter's Dr. Serena Kogan. On his way he meets the LA division of the Resistance in Anton Yelchin's Kyle Reese. Yelchin is great in the role, even making facial expressions that recall memories of Michael Biehn in the original film. With this and Star Trek, the kid is finally making it into the big time after a very successful early career. John Connor is also on the lookout for Reese, searching while hatching a plan to utilize a sound frequency that will shutdown the machines. Once Reese is captured, both Wright and Connor try to find a way to recover him.<br/><br/>As exposition, Terminator Salvation is a success. It refreshes our memories on the relationship between characters, re-familiarizing viewers with the age gaps and ramifications time travel has done to them through the previous stories. There is a nice progression for Marcus Wright as we see him for what he was and who he becomes. Sam Worthington, a virtual unknown on this side of the Atlantic, but soon to hit it big after filming the lead in James Cameron's new Avatar, sinks his teeth into the role. Here is a Terminator that has a heart, has emotions and feelings, and has the ability to go against programming, even if he doesn't know he was programmed to begin with. It is something seeing a soul behind the eyes of a face half composed of metal. Wright's story is where the plot's strengths end, though. We are introduced to Bryce Dallas Howard as Connor's wife and to Common and Bloodgood as two of his soldiers, but we really know nothing about them. Even Christian Bale's John Connor falls a bit flat.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, Bale plays the part to perfection, (I could have done with less growl), and the character lives up to the one we've seen before. There just isn't anything here to make us grow an attachment to him, to allow for the ending to resonate as much as the filmmakers would hope. Worthington's Wright is so complete a character, and even Yelchin's Reese is completely three-dimensional, that Connor is left by the wayside. Bale is asked to perform as someone more legend than man, someone making the tough decisions in order to save the world. I just wish the story allowed us to discover who he is and what he is to become; I guess maybe we'll get that in the next film. So, for now, just be happy to see a glorious landscape of charred, bleak destruction, inhabited by robotic vehicles of death wreaking havoc wherever they go. As an action flick it is great, but besides Marcus Wright's conflicted monster, there isn't much more than that. Truthfully, though, does there really need to be?"

","I like all the Terminators, I really do. I really dig even the 3rd part which was bashed a lot for no reason. However, this is not really a Terminator movie. It's a completely generic family friendly boring action movie loosely based on Terminator.<br/><br/>Where should I start? The main plot is pretty much what most action movies consist of. Random, long, dragged out action scenes (ALL the time) with very little emphasis on the storyline unlike the previous Terminators. The special effects might have been good but I was too blanked out to really take notice. The so called post Judgement day world isn't nearly as dark and hopeless as portrayed in the previous movies. Christian Bale is a terrible John Connor. There are just too many plot holes when compared to the prequels. I just watched the movie a few hours ago and I can barely remember any memorable part. There are too many useless characters. The melancholic and helpless atmosphere all the previous Terminators provide is not present. Oh yeah, and the (completely awesome) signature score has pretty much been ruined.<br/><br/>Overall this just a run of the mill action movie attempting to cash in on the Terminator's popularity. Complete bullcrap and I highly recommend you spend your 110 min on something else if you haven't watched it."
"grenmonkey","2","10","18","2 October 2009"," Terminated...
","Fot the fourth installment of the Terminator franchise, McG took the director's reins and steered the series towards something new. Terminator Salvation (2009) brings the story into the future war between the machines and the remaining human ”resistance” (or terrorists...) - an event which the previous films have all flirted with but something we haven't yet fully seen on screen. It could've been great: a post-apocalyptic world, people trying to survive in any means they can, machines hunting them day and night without a break, intense atmosphere etc...<br/><br/>But sadly it isn't great, it isn't even good or passable but very poor. There's plenty of action in the film; big explosions, big machines, big everything... but that's all there really is. The film, without a stop, jumps from another scene packed with action to another – and that would be just fine (like in the previous Terminator films) if the scenes or the action were imaginative and interesting or that there was an intriguing storyline being told in the process but Terminator 4 hasn't got any of those aspects in it.<br/><br/>The lack of a real or interesting story is what brings the film down. I could take the poor action and even the lousy performances from the cast if the story was right but now everything just has gone south. And it's a bit odd because I thought the principle idea of the story was great and something not seen in the Terminator -universe before but from the very first minutes of the film you'll find out that something has gone terribly wrong in the writing process (or with the executives..?) and the story filmed here is lousy, full of plot holes and shallow characters, cheesy dialog and so forth.<br/><br/>The cast (as I hinted above) isn't doing the best they can either; especially Christian Bale (John Connor) was a disappointment, Sam Worthington (Marcus Wright) not being that much better – and they're the two leading stars you could expect a good performance, no matter what the script was like.<br/><br/>Terminator Salvation is (sadly) a generic action rampage without any thought. The great post-apocalyptic setting is waisted alongside with the legacy of the three (or two...) previous films (a great source material by the way, though used ridiculously poorly) so badly that it's criminal. I know they're making a fifth one but I've lost interest. 1/4"
"Elohim777","2","10","18","9 July 2009"," T4? Abysmal. Not worthy of the franchise.
","After viewing it only one word popped to into my mind. ""Abysmal"". There are so many holes in story and logic, that I don't even know where to begin.<br/><br/>The nuke that goes off in the beginning for example. The helicopter crashes, fine. In the end? Just as close to the explosion, but somehow no EMP shockwave, or normal shockwave for that matter, and a LOOOOOOONG range on the detonator.<br/><br/>Then we have the chair, a keyboard and USB slot into Skynets mainframe. Why the hell is there a chair there? Or a keyboard and a USB slot for that matter? Does Terminators take breaks, and go surf the internet or something? Not to mention the terminator in the destruction camp wearing a bandana? (it was an exoskeleton) Who does it think it's fooling? ""Well, it has a bandana, it has to be a human!"" Also, when Connor meets arnie in the end, what happened there? Before the T-800 there were terminators with rubber skin, did they just decide to skip those? Also, whenever someone in the earlier terminator movies dreams of the future, all you see is laser weapons, basically. All you see in T4 is normal blackpowder weapons. Also, in the other terminator movies they make a point of having skulls everywhere on the ground. None to be found in T4.<br/><br/>Also the whole ""let's capture Kyle Reese to lure John Connor in here"" plot. Why the hell would Skynet leave Kyle Reese alive? Kidnap him, fake his lifesigns, kill him. When Connor arrives, have a couple of T-800's waiting with miniguns. Splat. Dead Connor, Skynet wins. But nooo, let's keep him alive and unguarded. That's the trick of winning the war! And what is up with the terminators all fighting in melee by THROWING the people around? Grab, crush, human dead.<br/><br/>If you want to see it, send me the rental/entrance fee, and I'll send you .gif animation of an explosion that repeats for 2 hours. You will see T4, basically.<br/><br/>Christian Bale was horrible as Connor as well. He needs to realize the difference between ""Batman"" and ""Terminator"", since Connor acted and talked like Batman.<br/><br/>Abysmal movie."

It just didn't feel like terminator. They were too many unimportant subplots and it felt like transformers, just mindless action sequences. Maybe the series just isn't the same without Arnold S., or maybe the series should never have ventured into the future after judgement day, but, why pick up at such an awkward point in the timeline. They should have picked up right where T3 left off, a destroyed planet being overrun by robotic killing machines. And before I end this, where are the lasers? The flashbacks from the other movies showed terminators and humans with laser guns, but everything is just normal bullets here. In conclusion, it sucked the big one"

But apparently it wasn't buried very deep and an unfortunate link on a website brought the whole damn thing back to me. So now I'll try and deal with it here and then lay it to rest for once and for all (and then nuke it). This movie is a disgrace, it's a shameless attempt to squeeze some more money from a successful movie-franchise, without even taking the trouble to write a good (or at least decent) story. The whole thing is pointless, the inconsistencies are mind-boggling, 83% of the movie makes no sense at all. Luckily I forgot most of the stupidities but some one cannot forget: - the 'climax' at the Skynet HQ: so John and Kyle are Skynet's biggest targets and Skynet's tried everything to get them and kill them - they get them/ trapped in their HQ and then only have one or two robots that fail to kill them? pffff - why does Skynet uses Kyle as bait for John to begin with? As Kyle is John's father to be, killing Kyle will erase John instantaneously - first John is very concerned that Skynet will find out about his secret base and keeps low profile, but then at one point he decides to blow up the mines around the base to get Marcus - surely that might attract some attention?<br/><br/>One of the most important points is that if you enter the possibility of time travel in story, you'll inevitably end up with the possibility of alternative realities and confusing, tricky story-telling issues and for sure, the former franchise installments were not rock-solid, but still they seemed to make sense and they made you care. And they kicked a#%. But this, this lifeless eyesore is a utter disgrace. Do not watch it, don't let the greedy, shameless makers earn a cent more for their unimaginative and lazy effort to make this 'movie'. Let us try and block it out of our common consciousness. Let's make it disappear. Forever and ever."

Nor am I one to revisit a widely publicised train wreck simply to stick the boot in. However when this dropped I attempted everything to avoid paying for it without being left out of the water cooler sewing circle. Any internet pundit worth their 'retro gaming' review site was picking apart continuity errors in Terminator 4 long before Bale lost his rag.

I caught myself at that moment contemplating a chuckle, which is rarer than catching yourself thinking. Feel guilty for making fun of Bale now? <br/><br/>Restraining myself from whinging about bleedingly obvious holes in plot, continuity and logic, the crumminess of the pre-T-800 terminators (complete with Doc. boots and superfluous clothing) and the fact that everybody is trying their damnedest to give weight to the names John Connor and Kyle Reese by pausing and looking shocked after they say them, this is more a hatchet job on entertainment itself.

It does a decent job, actually...however... be prepared for a different kind of movie.<br/><br/>It starts with a convict named Marcus Wright on death row, the year's 2003, then we shift to 2017, with John Connor, played by Christian Bale, who has greatly matured from the T3 Nick Stahl days, trying to understand what is Skynet plotting and how Marcus who suddenly wakes up in that year, fits in to all of this.<br/><br/>This fourth Terminator movie starts off with a very different kind of scope, the story cuts away between Marcus's POV and John Connor's POV until they cross paths, in which a somewhat predictable twist appears.<br/><br/>Like I said, it's a different movie, we no longer have one relentless machine stalking our heroes as they team up with a slightly inferior model, we kinda only get something along that template near the end of the film. <br/><br/>It's a little disappointing to see that the future doesn't hold as much menace as the other movies have mentioned. The trailer gives a glimpse of despair and complete loss of hope, a bleak picture, but the finished product reveals humanity as capable of facing such a threat as John Connor outsmarts and outfights a Terminator early on, as the movie goes on, machines are most of the times bested, particularly in chase scene with Kyle Reese, Marcus and a little mute girl we never actually get to know, who sorta seems to be thrown in to have a kid character.<br/><br/>Of course, if you're looking for loads of action, T:S delivers just that, but in the scope of a war movie. Some catchphrases from previous films make their timeless appearance. Though slightly out of place, but I have to admit that when Bale says ""I'll be back"", it does sound kinda cool.<br/><br/>But when I think about the plot, I think they could've done something better. My main beef is that Skynet never had any possible way of knowing that Kyle Reese is Connor's father. It doesn't even make the slightest bit of sense, I mean, was Skynet making a list of hits, was it randomly generated? Was it a coincidence Reese was in the hit list? That was a might big coincidence...<br/><br/>We never know, it's not clear, equally silly is how Marcus was only under influence of Skynet, but never truly controlled by them. They do nothing to stop him. Again, very silly.<br/><br/>Now, acting-wise, as much as I praised Bale in his other films, I have to admit that his modus operandi has become slightly predictable, his deep voice really sinks in, but there was nothing in there that could be considered extreme(this because, that fight with Shane Hulbert was still fresh in everybody's mind), but he passes the test. Finally get to see that brave John Connor, almost Rambo-like, instead of the annoying wimpy teenager, young adult from the Sarah Chronicles series and T3.<br/><br/>The Australian actor who plays Marcus Wright, Sam Worthington, also makes for a great performance, a half-man, half-machine with an identity crisis, at least when the twist arrives.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast do a terrific job and I have to give props to Roland Kickinger with his cameo, with the digital Arnold slapped into his face. I admit, my heart nearly stopped and I felt the urge to shout""Oh, yeah, I payed my ticket to see this!"". Short, obvious CG Arnold, but a very nice touch."
"Rhollmer","2","8","14","23 May 2009"," Simply awful
","This was simply one of the worst conceived movies in the Terminator series. This will very likely be thrown out and another made in its place, much like the recent ""Incredible Hulk"" remake.<br/><br/>There were so many points in the movie where you just ask yourself, ""What the hell was the director, writer, UNDERWRITER, whoever thinking?"" The movie was very reminiscent of the first Terminator movie in terms of being a ""B"" movie, yet it had a huge budget for terribly misplaced CGI.<br/><br/>There was no mention of HOW Kyle was sent back to the past. There was NO mention of sending him back other than to say ""If Kyle dies, the resistance is finished"". At one point, just before the siege on Skynet, it would have been more interesting (and plausible) if Bale had just dressed up as Batman or a Gramaton Cleric and gone in to destroy the place. I like Christian Bale. I really do. I feel for him. He did a fantastic job of acting this part out. He actually, probably, carried the film for most people. But the writing was amateurish at BEST.<br/><br/>Just the worst writing for a big-budget movie in years!"
"Vic_max","Null","11","21","31 May 2009"," Great special effects, good story and a conclusion to the series: nice!
","Given the harsh reviews that this film received from critics, I tried to keep an open mind. After the movie started, I began to think - hey, this is pretty good. It must really tank towards the end ... well, it didn't. It turned out to be a pretty good sci-fi flick from start to finish.<br/><br/>One interesting thing about this movie is that there were two plots going on: one for the main character John Conner (Bale) and one for the Kyle Reese (Yelchin) - Conner's 'future' father in the earlier Terminator movies. That worked out fine. I enjoyed both story lines.<br/><br/>The special effects were really great. There was a huge robot, superfast motorcycle bots as well as bizarre flying and underwater robot creatures. They were well conceived of and a lot of fun to watch. We even got to see Arnold Schwarzenegger again - even though it was all CGI. That was nostalgically cool.<br/><br/>For all the negative critical sentiments there seem to be, I think this movie is a fine way to spend 2 hours. It has great effects, a good story and a conclusion to the Terminator movies. Who'd want to miss that? I recommend seeing it."

They are selling a story that has an extremely dark and voilent original storyline that was never meant for for kids.<br/><br/>I mean terminator masks? How old would these kids be to wear the mask? 5? 6 years old? The film is supposed to be PG 13, translating into a 12A in the UK. A 12A rated film that MCG has dubbed ""not affecting the film?""

"Lobo69","1","17","36","1 June 2009"," Directing alone does not account for this failure.
","The directing on this movie is actually fairly competent from a strictly visual point of view, the second unit directing was also not too bad, but the story had no drive and you didn't give a crap what happened to anyone. The supposed shocker moments were like 'who cares' instead of 'WOW'.<br/><br/>Directors with no vision always produce movies like this, they end up trying too hard to please everyone and end up pleasing no one. Its a great example of hack film making, McG learned how to make movies by watching Michael Bay movies, not realizing that that makes him nothing more than a Michael Bay hack, and Michael Bay himself is nothing more than a hack of James Cameron. So we are watching a movie made by a hack of a hack of a good director.<br/><br/>Good directors are like any other great artist, they only come along 1 or 2 per generation. So far for this generation the only director that can be possibly included in that list is Nolan.<br/><br/>Let me give McG one hint, if your movie is filled with huge explosions from beginning till end, then none of the explosions will stand out in anyones mind, they just all run together. Have no more than 2 or 3 big explosions, have the spaced out so the biggest one is near the end, and have that be FOR some good reason or else no one will care.<br/><br/>This movie is just a turd, I'm sure the average movie going public will just ignore it but its a real letdown for fans of Terminator 1/2 who really wanted something a little more after T3.<br/><br/>Basically its a really poorly thought out story with one 'gotcha' moment in it that everyone can see coming a mile away. Too many big explosions that you don't care about. An ending that seems a foregone conclusion, and its really way too long.<br/><br/>Bad. Avoid."

","WARNING SPOILERS!!! What was the point of the movie? That's the question I kept asking myself after the movie. What was the point of the movie besides making money and gearing up for the obvious sequel a few years down the road.<br/><br/>Terminator Salvation in my opinion is by far the worst terminator movie mainly because there is no point to the movie. No big secrets are revealed nothing new was done that hasn't been done before and better, and the story went no where except to make money and to get ready for more movies down the road.<br/><br/>The only actors that had any impact were Sam Worthington and Moon Bloodgood. They were the only two that felt alive during this movie. Christian Bale did a terrible job, and he's a good actor two. Which reflects badly on the director McG. After all he did direct the two bad Charlie's Angles movies.<br/><br/>The only real good thing about this movie were the special effects, but if that's the best thing you can say about a movie that isn't animated than that's not saying much.<br/><br/>Overall: A real disappointment, just skip it and wait for it to come out on DVD and rent it."
"JAM-31","3","7","12","12 June 2010"," Why this film didn't work
","""Terminator 2: Judgment Day"" is one of my all time favorite films. The way that movie ended, so beautifully wrapping things up, I was against any more sequels being made. I am glad that that film still stands on its own, self contained, and that James Cameron had nothing to do with this film or the last one.<br/><br/>I was still excited about ""Terminator Salvation,"" though. The mythical future war against the machines I thought would be a great setting for a movie. But it turned out to be an opportunity wasted.<br/><br/>The main problem with this film is John Connor. Casting Christian Bale in this role was a great start, but unfortunately a finish. After reading an article about how director ""McG"" (No, it's not too late for him to change that name) pleaded with a resisting Bale to take the role, ""Give me a chance!"" I was willing to give him one too. But then I read that John Connor wasn't even originally in the script. That he was added later. This makes the role almost unnecessary, and it shows. Why was the script written without him in the first place? If you are going to do a ""Terminator"" movie without Arnold, then you HAVE to have John Connor in it.<br/><br/>John Connor in this film is flatly written and boring. It diminishes his importance and damages the mythology of the franchise. His brief entrance and appearance in T2 presented him like a legend as did Kyle Reese's description of him in the first Terminator film. Instead, Connor is never interesting or charismatic, and his only ""motivational"" moments come with passionless speeches over the radio. He needs to be William Wallace, Spartacus, George Washington, and all great leaders rolled into one.<br/><br/>The other major problem with the film is its convoluted story and lack of originality. I found Sam Worthington's character and performance mediocre in this film. His terminator-like character is a ruthless, evil bad guy, then a bad guy with heart, who is a machine, but he doesn't know it character arc is not so clear, and at the same time a cliché. One of the worst moments of cliché in this film comes when the ""Blair Williams"" character learns that Worthington is a terminator machine, yet still decides to rescue him from Connor and the resistance. OK, so Worthington saved her in a previous scene, but now she knows he's a terminator! Hello? Don't you think she should listen to the resistance when they prove to her that he's a machine and a dangerous enemy? Even if you can argue that her actions were plausible, do we really need to see this tired, dumb-character cliché in another movie? <br/><br/>As for the rest of the film, action scenes are ranked somewhat exciting to routine. Special effects are decent, although the world these characters live in isn't that impressive, exciting, or believable. <br/><br/>Grade: D+"

This... absolute travesty to film doesn't even deserve to use the name ""Terminator"" in its title. There was no plot, no character development, no story, no... anything. It was like a Micahel Bay film, (not that that's entirely bad) in that it was just action, and... not even really good action at that.<br/><br/>god! I'm trying to write a negative review and I can't even think of the words I want to say - that's how angry this film made me. Making a sequel to the best trilogy of all time must be difficult, but I could have stuck a pen in my ass, wiggled it around on a piece of paper for an hour, and written a better movie than this. For a summer blockbuster, it was maybe a 4/10, but as a followup to TERMINATOR?!??! no - your fans expected more - we expected something that lived up to the first 3.

"ingmark","1","7","12","11 June 2009"," Don't think too much about this movie... you will start getting very disappointed!
","(If you haven't seen this film, please do not read on) OK so after the terrible execution of terminator 3, I went into this with low expectations and to my pleasant surprise an hour and a half in I still had a smile on my face! Sam Worthington's performance is brilliant and he stole the show completely.<br/><br/>Now moving into the final 30mins of the film things started falling apart very very quickly - and by the end my heart had completely sunk... it was then in the pub after the film where you inevitably start thinking more about it that the real holes started appearing...<br/><br/>To make life easier I'm just going to list some the problems with this movie: 1. its a 12a. How can you make a terminator film a 12a???? The first movie was awesome because of its stark realism and utter darkness... and was an 18... you simply should not declaw a franchise such as this, its heartbreaking.<br/><br/>2. The resistance has helicopters and aircraft and seemingly roam around quite freely!!? In the flash backs in T2 they are struggling for any kind of movement anywhere. Via the satellites of the world, skynet would see any aircraft in the sky at anytime and simply destroy it... that is of course ignoring the niggling wondering as to where they get all the fuel from!?? They disappear into bunkers but the aircraft are just parked outside...<br/><br/>3. John Conner fights with a terminator and manages to block its strikes... oh dear. More than this where are the laser guns!!?? At the beginning of the film he shoots through the terminators head with a standard rifle... later on bullets are just bouncing of the terminator!!?? Why do they even bother carrying handguns!!? 4. Marcus is MORE human like than the Arnie terminator that is only developed at the very end of the film!? Arnie was barely passable as a person in his responses, movement etc and had a real sense of being a cold cyborg... Marcus was far too human like.<br/><br/>5. this might need more thought but Skynet identified Kyle early in the film... how would it know who he is when he has not yet been sent back in time? 6. John manages to walk into Skynet - even with Marcus disabling a gun turret this is just ridiculous.<br/><br/>7. The resistance then manages to just fly into Skynet completely unchallenged to rescue the captives... they are there for at least 10mins and when John comes out there still aren't any terminators shooting at them!!!?? this is where my heart really started breaking.<br/><br/>8. How many scenes can you steal from T2 when John is fighting the terminator at the end??? 9. Why was the terminator throwing John around?? How many times could it just have broken his neck with one hand?? 10. Skynet just allows Marcus to defy it and rescue John - in its own headquarters!!? Why was he not just turned off there and then??? 11. I'm sorry but the most insane part of the entire film - a heart transplant by a vet in the middle of the desert. antibiotics are hard to come by, but the drugs to stop John rejecting a new heart are completely abundant!! And our vet has managed to learn how to do specialist transplant surgery... oh dear.<br/><br/>There are more but i've lost the will to carry on. In short this doesn't not stay true to the original films at all - its a Disney version that has lost all its grounding in reality and hence all its edge and adrenaline.<br/><br/>My review - heartbreakingly bad."

","After watching the film I was frustrated, confused, and chuckling.<br/><br/>Frustrated because it could have been a great movie - They had Christian Bale, an amazing actor, Sam Worthington, an upcoming amazing actor, flawless CGI and production set, realistic action scene...the elements are there. But they do not create synergy. Perhaps because I have seen tons of movies, I was constantly irritated by plot holes or 'monologue' that explains the story when it looks complicated (probably by a toddler).<br/><br/>Here is the list of part I had mumbled 'What the...' or 'Come on...'. It should be spoiler-free.<br/><br/><ul><li>They mimicked the title sequence in the original Terminator, gradually revealing steel blocks which will comprise the movie title. It is easy to figure out, and after then, it is just a waiting time. You want realistic film? Get rid of title sequence.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>They start with a long explanation of how the judgment day started. Like that one in Star Wars, minus classic music. The whole movie is almost for people who had already seen the movie, so my guess is someone previously worked with Uwe Ball was in the executive team and order to slap in a minute-too-long description. Such as in Alone in the Dark.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Helena Bohnam Carter wears a bold cap at some point. Makes her look like one of these mushrooms in Super Mario.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>'Your heart is so strong'. One of the dialogs.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Apparently Christian Bale was injected Adrenaline during the whole shoot. That leaked rant was nothing compared to what really was going on.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>We got Sony hand-held device used for some gimmick. Because they show SONY logo. As big as that Nokia in Star Trek. On a hand-held that is in the market but nobody has ever used.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The Terminators carry huge machine guns and are happy to tore humans apart whenever they can. Yet why on earth they need to 'abduct' humans and put them into a concentrate camp? Unlike Matrix, they don't feed on human energy. Terminate them all! Shouldn't they be?</li></ul><br/><br/>I have just started warming up.<br/><br/>And tons of others. Bottom line - don't hold your expectation high, especially if you are looking for a survival story in a post-apocalyptic world with time-travel twist and thrill of not knowing who is the Terminator among us... that was what I was expecting, and it delivered for the first 10 minutes."

"imdb-21827","1","35","84","27 May 2009"," Terminator fans will despise this movie
","Let me cut right to the chase and just tell you up front this movie is pure crap. It is the most manufactured, cheezy movie that I have seen lately. Let me tell you why. <br/><br/>1. The original Terminator was well thought out. It was a great action film, but what made it a really great film for me was that it made sense. The best movies are those that introduce an element of fiction into reality, and continue to play within those rules of reality. Terminator did a beautiful job of this. The last release here, fell far far short of living up the the previous movies, and it does not even deserve to carry the name Terminator. Skynet is out to kill John Connor by any means possible, so when his father is processed into Skynet's holding facility. The #1 priority should have been to terminate him immediately. The movie should have ended at that point, since without Reese to travel back in time, John Connor can't exist, and the Terminators have altered the time line and invalidated everything we've seen up to this point. <br/><br/>2. Terminators are perfect killing machines. They are programmed with the best killing techniques and knowledge of human anatomy. So why can't a T-600 impale someone who is holding still from behind through the heart to kill them? Again this movie just threw away all of the previous work that had been put into the series to produce a crap movie and make a quick buck off of fans. <br/><br/>3. Where the hell did Dr. Serena Kogan come from? This was the character played by Helena Bonham Carter. This character was introduced out of nowhere, and when Skynet uses her to represent itself, it's a huge let down, and just looks like a rip-off of the borg queen from Star Trek. A really badly done rip-off. <br/><br/>4. Did they bother to use any of the awesome material done in Terminator the Sarah Connor Chronicles? No of course not, this is a stupid Hollywood film. This series was excellent, and well ahead of it's time, so much so that the short-sighted execs at Fox dropped it. <br/><br/>So overall the movie gets 0 out of 5 from me. It has no redeeming qualities. Even the use of Arnold as the T-600 was cheezy and horribly done. Do no go see this movie. You will regret it."

What the hell is Christian Bale doing in it? Did he sign the contract drunk? The female characters are largely pathetic. There are plot holes all over the place (why is John Connor so horrified by the technology that gave birth to a half-human half-Terminator, when he's already seen the T-1000 and T-X?). The whole thing is obsessed with being 'dark' and 'gritty', which it manages nowhere near as well as the 10 minutes or so of 'future' scenes in the first film 25 years ago.<br/><br/>Apart from the effects, and the new 30-foot tall Terminator, what is good about this film?"

","I've been a terminator fan since the early 90's and after the rather lacklustre T3 I was expecting more.<br/><br/>What made the first film so special is that it wasn't so much the action, but the overall feeling I got of the threat of an unemotional, calculating killing machine disguised as a human actually carrying out its mission. The film had suspense, a proper plot and believable characters. What's more is that it was truly terrifying and still holds up today.<br/><br/>The second film while more action oriented than the first, kept that feeling of suspense and danger constantly despite humanising the Terminator protecting John.<br/><br/>This film had none of that, it didn't even have a plot that I can remember. I spent the whole film trying to figure out who exactly was the target. If it was Kyle, then why didn't sky net kill him as soon as he was found instead of taking prisoners? There was no feeling of suspense or impending danger as the terminators were far too easy to kill and with projectile weapons. Remember how hard it was just to kill the original one? No problem here, just a standard machine gun will do the trick. Heck even the terminator will even give you a chance by hurling you about rather than snapping your neck as soon as it gets its tin-plated fingers on you.<br/><br/>The film was patronising, tame and badly written. If you like Terminator, stick with the first two movies and keep hoping for something truly worthy to come along to further the franchise."

T3 was meh, action packed which made it watchable. but this, is utter garbage. they could have branched out with the whole cyborg thing that was going on and created a new species of story characters that can either fight with the humans or assist the skynet. but no let us kill the cyborg in the end and not progress with terminator story, just keep it revolving on the cheesie lines of:""you are not alone, and pockets of resistance, this john conor you are the resistance."" over and over and over, i mean come on come up with a new catchy phrase!!! no innovation what so ever. honestly the only 2 minutes that i enjoyed through out the whole movie is when arnie showed up, that was epic. but that doesn't help the movie in achieving a higher grade than awful. you can call me a fanboy, which i'm sure someone will. to them i say, look at my account and look at how many posts a left. i rarely leave comments, but this movie was bad enough that it made me want to shout. it was a waste of 2 hours in my opinion. a word to cameron, if you want things done properly....do it yourself."

She is given a knight in shining armour. But still, she does not believe, she doesn't know who or what to trust, but nonetheless, the ever present danger moves her and the plot swiftly along.<br/><br/>My problem with terminator salvation is that the poetry of the first film isn't there.<br/><br/>I wanted to see a whole film of the apocalyptic world shown in the first terminator, all blue, neon and electric, a time of permanent night.<br/><br/>I wanted to see the day that skynet took over. That could have been the first act. John Connor arguing with the brass, himself doubtful that his crazy momma raised him in good faith.<br/><br/>This film just drifted way off track. The cybernetic hero is a total cop-out. The soundtrack was heavy and orchestral, rather than glitched and electronic.<br/><br/>The overall feel of the film did not set a global scene, it felt more like it was shot in the backyard. There were no vistas, no landscapes. <br/><br/>This is more Indiana Jones on the cheap than terminator. The machines were impotent and clanking, throwing people around. They didn't seem cunning or lethal.<br/><br/>The menace of the first terminator, a super-intelligent, painless and ruthless hunter on a mission, virtually unstoppable is not present in skynet's character. The machines do not come across as anything other than a skittle to be bowled at.<br/><br/>Skynet in the first terminator is an omnipotent and ruthless mechanism, a network of mechanised destruction, symbolic of man's industrialised and unmitigated horrors of the late 20th century.<br/><br/>I get the feeling that there is no true passion or intention behind this film. There is no deeper intention to inform or explore. Get 'em through the box office gate. One more for the money.<br/><br/>Oh well. I'd have hoped they'd return the canon to form. The post-apocalyptic terminator... shot in urban locations from around the world, made with special effects from the likes of chris cunningham and portraying a losing battle against skynet, the massacre of mankind... this was the film I wanted. This is a film I would buy on DVD.<br/><br/>As it is, one watch, and I was finished before the first act was concluded.<br/><br/>This film felt shorter than it actually was, in my memory it's under 20 minutes.<br/><br/>A good film feels like more time than it is, but does not bore you, it stretches moments and keeps you on the edge of your seat, a word in itself.<br/><br/>Terminator 1 I remember as a week."

","Firstly, McG needs to stop producing movies and stick with his cream of the crop television series. Terminator Salvation was a step down from the O.C., but in retrospect a step up on Spiderman 3. <br/><br/>The powers that be in Hollywood thought bringing back the genius writers from Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines was a bright idea....evidently not! This film lacked the much needed dialogue to keep an audience intrigued and tuned during the gaps between the visual effects. <br/><br/>Although some visual effects were appealing, it is hard to give them any positive recognition when comparing them to The Terminator and Terminator 2: Judgement Day. You would think with 25 years of technological advances we would see some drastic improvements in visual effects of the series, but you don't! It is the same old.<br/><br/>I don't even want to get started on the rips that are mirrored in this film, but I will. While resting my eyes during this film, I could not stop thinking that I was watching Batman, damn Christian Bale and his mono tone voice. Rips and parallels from Apocalpyse Now, Schindler's List, Armageddon, I Am Legend, I Robot, and many others are evident. <br/><br/>The movies predictiveness could have been some what masked if they eliminated the PG13 restrictiveness during several scenes, but wait, that would mean less money from their target audience which is a big ""NoNo"". <br/><br/>At most this movie is a rental.......actually I wouldn't waste the money just stream it. <br/><br/>Guinnage"

"happyendingrocks","7","9","17","2 July 2009"," Come on, people, it's not THAT bad
","I definitely consider myself a fan of the Terminator franchise, so not seeing this film simply wasn't an option for me. Both the original Terminator and its follow-up T2: Judgement Day are masterpieces, each for very different reasons. I also rather enjoyed the problematic third film Rise Of The Machines, which succeeded in adding new dimensions to the established tale, even if it did so with way too much stilted humor. The downer ending left with us at the conclusion of Rise turned key elements of the franchise upside down in a way that still made narrative sense; no easy feat considering the entire series involves the rather tricky device of time travel.<br/><br/>What Terminator Salvation was supposed to deliver is an extended look at the war against the titular machines, which has been teased for three films with some far-too-short glimpses of mechanized carnage. Though the entire film is set in the not-so-distant future shown to us in these brief but breathtaking flashes, when we join Salvation, the war is already well underway. Humanity is already losing the battle (in fact, one of the most morbidly awesome aspects of the entire series is that we are never told who triumphs in this epic struggle between man and machine), and our tired and tireless human resistance fighters are joined in the throes of what must be just another day in paradise for them.<br/><br/>That right there should be enough to make Salvation an awesome film, but even though we spend the entire movie fleshing out what has previously only been offered to us in tantalizing mini-sodes, the film as whole doesn't offer much more than a longer glimpse. The story we see resolved here isn't the conclusion of the war with the machines, it's merely the tale of one battle along the way. This bodes well for future (inevitable) installments in the franchise, as there is still plenty of material left to engage. But since we've waited over 20 years to see this bit of the story's history (or future, more accurately) played out, the little we are given here in the way of mythic enhancement is a bit too meager to make this film epic in the same ways the previous three films were.<br/><br/>A big part of the problem is knowing exactly how the story is going to turn out. The only thing the film-makers could do here to surprise us is kill off one of the main characters, but that would negate the events of the first three Terminator films and derail the entire story arc. Not a possibility, apparently.<br/><br/>Though the film offers plenty of worthy additions to this franchise's rich legacy, the sense of predictability works directly against those. There's no real tension in John Connor's quest to save his future father (or past?... See, this time travel business does get screwy), since we already know dad is saved, otherwise we wouldn't be watching John Connor try to save him.<br/><br/>But, I did give this thing a 7, so I should probably explain why. By far the most enjoyable aspect of the film is the notion of a machine that doesn't know it's a machine. This human/cyborg hybrid can only be viewed as a prototype, as the machines would certainly realize after the events of this film that using human parts to make a machine, and not removing the emotional and recall functions of the human source material, is a dire mistake. (It certainly doesn't work out so well for Skynet here). There is a fantastic turn thrown in in regard to this, which I won't spoil here, so the film is at least keenly aware enough of its lack of shock potential to offer us something in the way of a plot twist.<br/><br/>As we would expect, or at least hope for, there are some splendidly spectacular action scenes, although none of them rival the most over-the-top bits in the previous Terminator films. Again, predictability sours this a bit.<br/><br/>Shockingly, the weakest link in this film is Christain Bale. Bale is certainly one of the finest actors currently plying his craft, but his stiff turn as John Connor here finds him so on autopilot, we can't help but wonder if the ultimate twist is that Connor, himself, is a machine. He barks his dialogue with the same raspy croak he gave Batman, and since the core conflict of this tale is the differences between humanity and machines, it's very strange that Bale doesn't show us anything resembling emotion here.<br/><br/>Bale's limited energy leads to some very bad dialogue, and the most absurd moments in the film (most notably, Bale re-interpreting the Motley Crue song ""Kickstart My Heart"") offset the refreshingly dark and humorless tone that sets this outing apart from the cheese factory found in Rise Of The Machines. While the first three installments all followed their own twisting logic, there are things in this film that definitely do not make sense, such as why cyborgs using human hearts to create hulking body-building killing machines would bother keeping old women and children alive in their experiment waiting cells. You also have to ponder exactly what blood type these robots have to make the ridiculous finale possible.<br/><br/>Should this be the penultimate Terminator film, then the franchise is destined to go out on a considerably lower note, granted. But there are still plenty of angles to flesh out in this narrative, and perhaps future Terminator installments can answer some of the questions raised here. The machines will rise again, there's no doubt about that. In the meantime, a so-so Terminator film is still a lot better than most of your other options."
"kechhh","Null","5","8","20 July 2013"," Not Good
","Not very good in my opinion.<br/><br/>Connor lacked any good characterization in this - I just didn't care about him in here. Didn't care about the half human half robot guy either - I actually don't even remember his name and I only watched this a few weeks ago.<br/><br/>The plot was completely predictable and unexciting. I could tell what was going to happen basically from the beginning.<br/><br/>And at least the others were semi-believable in its action. Connor breaking into a super secure futuristic robot facility? I don't think so.<br/><br/>Any attempts at a universal overarching robot-human-spirit theme also failed.<br/><br/>Finally, any attempt at nostalgia and comedy through Arnold failed. This movie did not belong in the series and it tainted the real trilogy."
"Morbius_Fitzgerald","3","5","8","17 March 2013"," Awful sequel.
","I am a huge Terminator fan. I sat through the first three films and even the series but this was beyond liking.<br/><br/>First off the acting is hard to rate when the only dialog audible is screaming. The rest is a mumble. Whoever co-ordinated the sound for the dialog parts was horrible.<br/><br/>I will save this movie some grace by revealing why this film is not a 1/10. Technically this movie is okay and the visual effects are rather good.<br/><br/>The script is the main weakness of this film. You have awful lines such as ""Win or lose, this war ends tonight!"" which is yet another dramatic scream.<br/><br/>The worst thing about this film is that it tries too hard and its because of this, it fails miserably. Have you ever seen something that tries too hard but because it tries too hard, it fails miserably? That is probably the end result of this. Its rather ironic considering that T3 barely tried anything which is kind of why it fails. I think this series desperately needs James Cameron back. It would be better than the Avaturd and its sequels...hopefully.<br/><br/>I am to this day wondering why a film like this actually makes money. Why do people watch this? I'm a terminator fan so I can't ""see what the target audience likes about it"" because I AM the target audience. I guess the audiences of the world want brainless crap for their entertainment now. Why? I'll never know."

"krycek19","4","5","8","20 December 2009"," PG13 is not even this movies biggest problem
","The one thing I feared the most when Salvation came out was the PG13 rating. I am sick of greedy producers, turning adult franchises, kiddie-friendly, just so they can sell more tickets. They ruined Die Hard 4 and Indiana Jones 4, with this ridiculous rating, that Spielberg should apologize for.<br/><br/>However they really pushed the limit within this rating, with Salvation. It is pretty violent. But there is still no blood and they are still not allowed to say the f-word. I will never understand the double standard when it comes to American censorship. It's okay to show people having their necks broken or being choked to death as long as there is no blood and no nudity. And nobody says the oh so horrible f-word.But the rating is not the biggest problem here. The problem is Mcg, Bale and a really dumb script.<br/><br/>Why they chose Mcg as a director (for god sakes, use your full name, if you wanna be in the big league, you're not a black rapper) is beyond me. The man has musicvideoes, Charlies Angels and episodes of Supernatural on his resume. Not exactly impressive. Cameron should never have signed off on the rights to the franchise. Mcg, tries his best, but he has several problems, Bale can't act. He is the most overrated actor of his generation. Both Edward Furlong and Nick Stahl, did a ten times better job, portraying John Connor. All Bale does is fight and yell and scream. He shows no depth, no emotions, we really don't care what happens to him. And I rooted for Marcus Wright in the end, not John Connor.<br/><br/>And the script oh my god... first of all, what the hell happened to Marcus, in the 15 years that went by since they turned him into an infiltrator?? That is never explained. If he was being used to get to John Connor and Kyle Reese why did'nt they activate him sooner? Why does it come as a surprise to Connor that Marcus is a cyborg? He has met Terminators twice before in his life? Reese says in the first movie: ""you stay down by day, you can move around at night, but you still have to be careful, because the H.K's use infrared."" In this future the resistance move around in broad daylight, there are no battlefields with skulls on the ground and cars with skeletons inside. They have no ray-guns or other futuristic weapons.But they have military-choppers that look too new, they even have a submarine. Where would they get that kind of stuff in the middle of a nuclear war that has destroyed everything? In flashes of the future in the first movie they live underground in bunkers. Here they have a hanger and camps like in Iraq and Afghanistan. Where they can be killed anytime by H.K's and terminators. But apparently terminators only appear in this future, when the resistance play music. Yeah that makes a lot of sense.<br/><br/>They eat coyotes and they have milk. Would'nt all animal-life have been wiped out in a nuclear-war?? Don't even get me started on the cgi-Arnold.<br/><br/>The little brat: Star, has no lines and there is no point of her being in this movie.<br/><br/>Bryce Dallas Howard is ugly, she's a bad actress, and her role in this movie is pointless. On top of that she spent the entire movie, looking pregnant, but it's never explained if she is pregnant. In Rise of the machines Kate was fighting side by side with John. Here she is reduced to being a doctor who is never in the field with Connor. And there is no chemistry what so ever between her and Bale.<br/><br/>Moon Bloodgood (is that a real name?) as Williams is annoying and her relationship with Marcus is pointless as it never evolves anyway.<br/><br/>The only two people that gives good performances are Sam Worthington and Anton Yelchin as Marcus and Reese. Especially Yelchin acts a lot like Biehn did in the first movie. He has potential to become a great actor. And Worthington should have played Connor. <br/><br/>The actionscenes are great though and I love all the new terminators.<br/><br/>But it is a PG13 future. Had the movie been R-rated like the previous films, it would have been a completely different film.<br/><br/>But without a decent script, decent acting, a good story with heart and soul and humour and loalty to the flashes of the war in the previous movies, even an R-rating, would'nt have saved this sinking ship. And in the end when they blow up Skynet, as easy as boiling an egg and kill the only interesting character: Marcus and Connor gives his tenth speech, you realize that the franchise has been ruined for good."

","Terminator Salvation has saved the franchise. The first two terminator films are my all time favourites but the third one was not needed so a reboot was a much better idea than making Terminator 4.<br/><br/>Terminator Salvation is a beginning of a new trilogy and we finally get to see the war between the machines and the humans lead by John Connor instead of another time travel concept.<br/><br/>The movie was really interesting & entertaining right from the beginning to the end with a lot of soul about John Connor a prophet who is mankind's only hope for survival in a post-apocalyptic world.<br/><br/>We also get to see new machines instead of just the T-800s and they were a lot more darker & sinister looking than the ones in the previous films. Christian Bale's performance was amazing and McG who is not a well known director has done a really good job with a high budget summer movie."

","I hate to say this, but it was the most pathetic attempt to make a movie that would make at least a little bit sense. Nothing in this film does make any sense. My expectations were not high, but I ended up disappointed anyway. I sincerely hope the point was that Skynet in fact didn't want John Connor dead, otherwise I can't take this seriously.<br/><br/>Instead of some dark post apocalyptic future we've got few soldiers in the middle of desert with a lot of helicopters and one submarine in heavy seas. No big battles, no hard choices, not even some serious villain. And the most important thing, no believable plot to kill John Connor.<br/><br/>To sum it up this is a movie about how John Connor with help from the enemy became leader of the resistance in the movie symbolically represented by bunch of helicopters. And why am I talking about helicopters all the time? Because there was more helicopters than terminators! Of course I don't count those mechanical river worms and that over-sized piece of junk who's probably taken off from X-Men cartoons.<br/><br/>As a standalone TV movie, it wouldn't be that bad. But as a sequel to The Terminator and T2? Give me a break, they can't belong to the same universe."
"moviemaniac008","10","5","8","23 August 2009"," Review from a non Terminator fan
","When I first saw this movie's trailer for a screening of The International, I said to myself ''Man, this is going to be THE movie of the summer''. Well, I guess I was wrong, because out of the 200 million dollars this movie cost, it only made 120 million, which is a fair amount at the box-office but still, this movie could be considered a flop. And I'll admit it, I had heard reviews coming from the 1st weekend of this movie's release, saying that it was really hard to understand, I went to see it in it's 2nd week, and at first I went to see it only for the pleasure of seeing robots blow up. Well, this ain't Transformers, and I was pleasantly surprised. The story might have been a bit tough, but I didn't struggle much with it (although Terminator fans who are reading this review could and should correct me if ever I am wrong somewhere in this review). Basically, it is the year 2018, and John Connor is a man who is leading a resistance against Skynet, a computer/robot program who senses the humans as a threat. Connor must protect a young man named Kyle Reese, who is Connor's father, and must send him back to the future, where he can impregnate his mother and therefore ''confirm'' his existence. Elsewhere, Marcus Wright, a convict who was sentenced to death, wakes up 15 years after being ''dead'' and discovers what the world has become. He teams up with Kyle Reese...and you know the rest.<br/><br/>The visual effects were super, and the script was hard to understand at first but pretty well-written afterwards. The acting was pretty good overall, with Anton Yelchin, Common and Moon Bloodgood giving average performances. Sam Worthington excels as Marcus Wright, whereas Christian Bale could've been a lot better, but was still pretty good: Don't expect any ''Dark Knight'' performance. Bryce Dallas Howard was good as well, but unfortunately, her character didn't have much screen time. The action scenes, again, were awesome and very well made, with the visual effects as stunning as Transformers (though you probably won't feel the difference because they aren't shown in the same ways). All in all, Terminator fans have been mixed on this movie, but I find that it's a good movie for the action if you haven't seen the originals, and I don't know if a Terminator fan should see it, but honestly, this movie is McG's best and I enjoyed it."

Still those things could be forgiven. Why the small child with Kyle Reece though? I mean why? it was a pointless addition and distraction that added absolutely nothing to the film and took away something from the grittiness of it all. The child was one of several small things like that I believe he made an error with. I don't want to list them all.<br/><br/>Here was the MAJOR problem I had with this movie...DANNY ELFMAN and the WORST SCORE I have ever heard for a movie such as this. It sounded like I was watching Independence day not a terminator movie. Every nuance of sound that came from this score took away from the performance, took away from the plot, took away from the atmosphere in general...any sense of atmosphere or emotion or anything at all was 'terminated' as soon as Danny Elfman parped in with his nonsense.<br/><br/>It has to go down as one of the worst decisions in movie making history to employ this man to do the score...what the hell was wrong with the scores used by Cameron in the previous terminator movies? they were perfect, they had a darker more sinister feel.<br/><br/>I am 90% certain that had the score been the T2 score or something similar most of the people who disliked this movie would like it much more. The score dragged the whole movie down and made everything seem worse.<br/><br/>Seriously I cannot understand how professional movie making people could seriously think this score was in any way appropriate to this franchise.<br/><br/>Please god McG release a DVD version with a completely different score. Otherwise I will hold you personally responsible for the travesty you have unleashed on us.<br/><br/>I give this movie an 8/10 purely because I believe the basics of it are there, the actors are there, the plot is there...however if I fully consider the score as well I would give this movie 0/10.

"Akira-36","5","5","8","6 June 2009"," This latest installment has more dust and metals, then bones and dread.
","Terminator Salvation is a league of its own, in fact it feels like a movie that belongs to a different series. Despite it's cyberpunk legacy, Terminator Salvation feels like a war drama that happens to be set in a sci-fi post-apocalyptic future. Gone are the dark sky with red and blue rays penetrating the smoky horizon. This latest installment has more dust and metals, then bones and dread.<br/><br/>I think that's what missing from this movie: a sense of dread. Every time I watched the flash forwards from the original trilogy, they always had a grim sense of nihilistic dread. Even the comics of the 80's and 90's retain that sense of hopelessness and impending doom.<br/><br/>Terminator Salvation however took a different turn, and in most part it worked. The action, visual effects and plot were engaging. They may not be the best, but it's definitely worth watching the movie in the cinema. <br/><br/>McG seems to have a more mature film direction, and the re-polished script certainly helped gelled the characters more. I was wholly entertained and it was fun to watch several references to the previous trilogy, especially a delightful sort of a cameo by an 'original cast'.<br/><br/>I think the main problem of the movie is the lack of running time. It seems the movie would do better with more character developments, but unfortunately the action sequences were competing too hard for screen time. Otherwise, I would love to learn more about characters like Marcus, Blair, and Kate Brewster. Even John Connor himself didn't get enough screen time, except for yet more action scenes.<br/><br/>This is where the original trilogy shone, we got to know the characters well so it felt like we were walking the distance along with them. Whereas with T4, I felt that we were mostly just spectators.<br/><br/>Christian Bale and Sam Worthington have done a good job though, and I hope the sequels will be even better. One thing to note: the sub-plot with Marcus's character is inspired by a story arc by Dark Horse's Terminator comics published in the 90's."
"MichaelMyers2","7","5","8","22 May 2009"," Very entertaining, great action, but has some flaws
","From the first action scene in the future, I expected great entertainment, but not so great directing and possibly writing, and that is what we got. The style of the first action scene where we first see Connor made it somewhat hard to watch and it was not really consistent, it seemed like the director couldn't really figure out his own unique style so he switched back and forth with shots, for instance in the first sequence with the helicopter as well as the part where wright escapes from the resistance people and Connor, to the rest of the action in the end. The inconsistent visual style and camera made it a little bit hard to watch at times and was annoying, but still the scenes were very good The writers didn't fully explain John Connor's back story and how he is so revered by people like Reese and the resistance people. I know some of the back story was supposed to come from the old terminators and the story takes place in the middle of the resistance, not at the beginning right after judgment day or at the end, but still as a stand alone movie that is not titled terminator 4, but a more original and unique terminator salvation, they need to tell more back story about john Connor so it can stand alone without seeing the other terminator movies. I was disappointed that Conner wasn't really the main character and the writers did not do justice to Bale's acting ability. The writing of Connor's part seemed pretty shallow and he wasn't a real developed character.<br/><br/>The acting was overall solid in my opinion, and some plot points weren't really developed that well, such as when Blair in that short of a time falls in love with the machine Marcus Wright. I know he saved her life and that is a big part and they spent 2 whole days together that we didn't really see on the way to the resistance camp, but it still seemed somewhat undeveloped how they got to that point.<br/><br/>The little references to the previous terminators were nice, such as Kyle Reese's first words and Connor's I'll be back. The Arnold part where they superimposed his face onto the guy was the low point, where it was clearly computer generated and that was the lone exception in what was otherwise a movie filled with amazing special effects in my opinion, i could hardly notice them.<br/><br/>Overall it was a very good movie, extremely entertaining, but i think the writing and directing really held it down a little bit and they had some good actors like Ironside and Bale, but they really didn't favor their acting abilities with the writing. It was a lot of yelling and screaming and some stuff that we saw in the previews, but the movie seemed to rely more on visuals than the dialogue, which brought it down a little bit.<br/><br/>Definitely a great terminator installation far and away better than 3 just completely massacres the 3rd movie out of the water and really i enjoyed it as much as or more than the first two, but they really can't be compared, since the first two were based more on the suspense of outrunning the terminator, and this was where the humans were more proactive in their roles against the machines."
"listorm43","1","8","15","12 December 2009"," This is one of the worst franchise films EVER MADE
","Spoiler Alert<br/><br/>As a die hard Terminator fan of the first two movies and a tremendous hater of the third, I figured I'd give this a chance. I went in to the theater with the lowest expectations and it failed to meet them. In fact as a fan of the series, I even felt insulted. This film isn't worth your time.<br/><br/>Terminator Salvation begins on Death Row where Marcus (Sam Worthington) repents that his brother and two cops are dead because of him. He is approached by a Cyberdyne Systems executive (Helena Bonham Carter) to donate his body to their company. He does and in ten minutes, he becomes a pawn in the future war between man and machines. Still with me?<br/><br/>The humans are not really human. NOT led by John Conner (Christian Bale) because he is considered by many to be a false prophet, they fight the war that never seems to end and never seems to have a point. Nevermind that Bale can't decide if he's John Conner or Batman at points and he yells repeatedly as if the everyone is a cinematographer, the writer miss the point on Conner, he is a man haunted by the future and the plot point of him being a ""false prophet"" is quickly dismissed when he pleads to the ""survivors"" to not listen to their military leadership. <br/><br/>But what's insulting is the storyline is the Marcus one. First, Marcus encounters Kyle Reese (Anton Yelchin), who will become the father of John Conner when he is sent to the past. Skynet (the machine supercomputer) targets Kyle Reese for that reason. Unfortunately, they say that the were no records of Conner's father in the first film, only what Conner knows. That is why the terminator is sent BACK THROUGH TIME to kill his mother, but the film decides to say that you can change the past IN THE FUTURE. Getting back to Marcus, who feels guilt for something that no one ever knows why? Tell us, please, but we never know. Marcus meets Conner when a magnetic landmine attaches to him. Conner finds out that Marcus is really a terminator with half a brain, but whole organs. Why would a robot need organs? <br/><br/>Eventually, Conner and Marcus team up to take out Skynet and rescue Reese. Thus is where we see for the first time in the series, Skynet. For twenty five years of build up, Skynet is no scarier than an iPod. Skynet breaks down it's plan to kill John Conner now... in the present. Wasn't the point of sending terminators into the past was to kill him BEFORE he can spark the Human Rebellion? And for that matter, the purpose for Marcus is infiltration. That's why he has organs... but wasn't Skynet sending terminators in for years? Why would she need one with a brain? And THEN MARCUS disobeys and rips out a circuit and becomes his own free person. Which is funny because Skynet made him and it blew up the world, but can't get one of it's own creations to obey? Still with me?<br/><br/>The ""powerful"" moment of Conner meeting his father was unemotional and the fight in the end are long enough to make me wish Skynet succeeded. Conner's quest to save his father from getting killed so he can go back in time to create him (uh... what?), is more selfish reasons because Conner doesn't want to be unborn (again... what?). Marcus' search for redemption is hallow because we don't know why he feels guilty. The writers told us to he feels remorse, so we must right? That's the insult from the filmmaker and screenwriter. And there was never a feeling of imminent danger and it dragged. How can an action scene drag? MacG found a way. This film could have taken a lesson from Star Trek on time space, but it contradicts itself over and over. Then was nothing new to the action, which the first two brought.<br/><br/>This film uses the classic Terminator lines ""Come with me if you want to live,"" ""I'll be back,"" and ""No Fate but what we make for ourselves"" with out much sense or drama. The ""No Fate"" comment concludes the film and it's in there solely because it was in the other films. Why not just add, ""All you have to do is decide what to do with the time given to you""? That would fit just as much. <br/><br/>The end is formulaic and predictable, but I'm not sure if any of the actors had a chance. So they get a pass. I'm not sure if Mac G could have saved it, but at least he made a loud movie. This cries out to Alien: Resurrection for help, but even that film had credible moments in it. This one doesn't. Nothing original and nothing that stayed with you when you left the theater. (Resurrection at least had the ""other clone attempts scene). It uses the ideas crammed from writers who didn't sit down to think out whether or not it was relevant to the series. It gets a 1 out of 10, only because it made to the screen. You can't just make a sequel because you want to. At least, pay attention to the series. There will be more and I ask again, ""why?"""
"BillWalsh","7","8","15","3 June 2009"," Not the train wreck the critics would have you believe but not without its fair share of faults.
","Terminator Salvation is not a bad movie. Our nations top critics would have you believe so but having seen the film for myself I'm glad to report otherwise. On the other hand, Terminator Salvation is not a great movie either. In other words, it occupies a gray middle ground between the two. it is a film that certainly has its very fine moments as well as some faults.<br/><br/>Let's start with the good. Regardless of what you think of the film's director McG, you cannot deny the man's ability to depict on screen action. The action scenes and special effects are some of the best I've seen, as he really knows what he's doing behind the camera when the time comes to thrill the audience. This alone warrants enough reason to see this movie in theaters. You'll know what I'm talking about once you see it. Anton Yelchin steals the show as Kyle Reese. He delivers the best performance in the film by far. This kid is the real deal and barring some unforeseen tragedy, he will be a big, big star in the near future. The film's pace is brisk, as McG keeps the plot moving at a nice clip. This, though, acts both as a gift and a curse. More on the pace in a minute.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, my praise for this film pretty much ends there. Bale is not half bad as the hero John Connor. At times his performance feels somewhat flat but I think that this may have been a premeditated choice on his part to depict Connor as war weary. He's not bad in this role as critics would have you believe. The other film's characters unfortunately lack depth. They were very thinly written and one dimensional. And this is where the film's main problems lie. The script feels half baked. The story presented here isn't half bad, it's just that it seems rushed. A revision or two would have probably helped to flesh out the story and characters more. And lastly, there's the pace. As I mentioned earlier, the film moves along at a nice clip. You'll never be bored. The fault I find with this is that is that the filmmakers never stop to smell the roses. They'll never let the points their trying to make resonate for a minute because before you know it there's another chase or another Terminator will present itself and try to kill everyone. And as a result the film lacks the emotional depth that was ever so present in T2 and even a bit in T3. Some will say that I'm nitpicking here but I'd rather watch a movie that depicts great action AND makes me think rather than a movie that just has great action scenes. The last five minutes of the film are lacking as well. Simply a weak ending.<br/><br/>All in all though, I enjoyed this movie. I had a good time and was able to live with the film's faults because the action scenes were that good. If only McG had demanded a better script from the film's writers we could have had a truly epic Terminator film. Instead we've only been presented with a somewhat good Terminator movie. Fun to watch but about as deep as a puddle. Here's hoping McG gets to take another crack at this franchise because he shows some real promise here. Next time though, I hope he has the good sense to demand a better screenplay."

","Horrible, and this year's big bomb, Bale does not have the same interpretations, and does not follow a sequence, the film will disappoint many fans of the series, a few scenes of action and when you are badly made, Bale does not seem to matter much film, but with the money... fell heavily on interpretation from your last film, badly done poorly produced, without special effects, it seems another movie that squeezes the budget and cut everything, Production, Direction, Screenplay, strong candidate for the trophy raspberries; This is the worst movie of the series without no doubt, ...

"thesar-2","2","8","15","23 May 2009"," The only Salvation would've been them ending at 'T2.'
","I gave Christian Bale credit for bringing the true ""Batman voice/bark"" to Batman in 'The Dark Knight,' despite the general public's ignorance on the true Batman and how he communicated. Unfortunately, against my argument, he uses it again in 'Terminator: Salvation' and this time, it really didn't fit.<br/><br/>Aside from that, we have just a money-grabbing sequel that basically just showed ""Judgment Day"" combat scenes and was completely unnecessary. Yes, it has bangs, some good action sequences and yet another great Asian female kicking butt. But, what's gone is: the heart, the character development, the suspense, the acting and the good, sometimes funny dialogue from the first 2 films – the only ones that should count. 'T3' was a complete waste of space, so I don't count that one, and though this 'T4' is slightly better, it also shouldn't count. No wonder James Cameron didn't approve of this sequel.<br/><br/>The series was as perfect as it could've been as well as a complete story with the original 'Terminator' and 'T2.' I seriously laughed out loud at the clichéd ""bad guy revealing the evil plot to the hero"" towards the end, downgrading Skynet to a mere human and stereotyped villain. Also, I respect Carter, but she was equally as bad in her cancer role, and what was with the helicopter dive to the submarine? Seriously? I should've listened to myself with my promise not to see another 'Terminator' sequel after 'T3' – the same promise I made on this dismal 'Jurassic Park III.' Yet, I did like Worthington and Bloodgood's performances, but Bale was certainly not at his best, and that kid, Jadagrace practically made me crack up as a cross between 'Aliens' kid Newt, 'Day Earth Stood Still' kid Jacob and a mini-Sideshow Bob. What a completely unoriginal character, as were most stand-ins.<br/><br/>And enough with the homage to the original films – every 20 minutes – which only made me want to watch them again VS this one again Most of it was extremely predictable and got zero reaction from the audience I was with. Not the worst movie, but a severe downgrade from 'T1 and 2.'"

I really do wish that there was more chemistry with Bryce and Christian but I suppose he wasn't there to be super emotional, anyway.Sam really took me by surprise because I started off ho-hum with him and quickly changed my mind.All in all, I will be going back to see it one more time because it really was action packed!"

"The-Sarkologist","9","3","4","17 June 2017"," Finally
","I remember when I would sit in my flat watching Terminator 2 over and over again, namely because it was my favourite movie of all time, and also because the night I first saw it brought back some wonderful memories. Okay, I don't watch it anywhere near as often anymore but that is beside the point. However, I remember talking to my friend and telling him (and him agreeing) that they really should make a movie that is set during the war with the machines, and unfortunately it turned out that Terminator III simply wasn't that movie. However Salvation was, and after watching it a second time I really didn't appreciate how much I loved the concept.<br/><br/>As I have already mentioned, Salvation is set in the future after Skynet had nuked humanity and is a story of one of the battles where Kyle Reece and John Conner become friends. Okay, Conner knows who Reece is, but Reece has no idea who Conner is beyond him being a commander in the resistance. In fact it is made clear that at this stage in the war he isn't the leader of the resistance, but rather just one person of many. In a way this movie is also about how he ended up taking charge (though it was hinted that at the end of the third movie he had already set himself up in that role). However, there is a third character that has been thrown into the mix – Marcus – whose role I won't necessarily reveal since that would be one huge spoiler.<br/><br/>Salvation is the only Terminator film which doesn't star Arnie, but that probably has a lot to do with him being Governator of California (a title that is probably going to stick with him for the rest of his life, though there was always this desire that they would change the constitution to allow him to become President). However, a lack of Arnie doesn't necessarily mean that this film is a bad film, even though Arnie pretty much happens to be a staple within the Terminator universe.<br/><br/>As for the film, well, I have to admit that I am very impressed, and unlike a lot of movies, it certainly met my expectations. Sure, the timeline does get skewed in the next film, but then again this is a franchise about changing the future, so of course things aren't necessarily going to turn out the way that they are expected to turn out. Also, it isn't a film about how they defeat Skynet or capture the machine that is used to send Reece back in time. Rather, as I mentioned, it is more about John and Kyle meeting up (though I note that John is actively searching for Kyle in the film). Also, we have Katheryn Brewster return, this time as Kathryn Conner, which is a nod at the previous film. Mind you, that terminator at the end did look a lot like Arnie (namely through the use of CGI)."
"navani456","3","3","4","29 April 2012"," Terrible movie!! EXTREMELY disappointed
","This was the second to last movie I saw with my mom in theaters before she passed away. She hated it. I hated it. It's such an awful movie! First, I do not like Christian Bale too much personally, he seems like a jerk. In this movie, it's almost as if he's playing himself, and it's not appealing. Sam Worthington did a great job, and many of the other people did too, but Christian Bale I think was a terrible choice.. I understand children grow up (John Connor), but it's as if Christian Bale just completely ignored the other movies.<br/><br/>What made the other movies so great were the chase sequences.. Nail biting, intense, and I actually liked T3. Salvation doesn't really give you the thrill the others did. It seems to just get lost in explosions without anything significant to add to the overall story. <br/><br/>I hope they make a new one, even if they keep with Bale, I hope he's not as big of a blubbering idiot as he was in this one ..<br/><br/>This is my personal opinion, and the reason it's so full of hate is because I was EXTREMELY excited for this movie and it was the exact opposite of what I wanted."
"quinnox-1","5","3","4","3 February 2011"," Some good action but with a muddled and confused story
","Terminator Salvation has some good action scenes, with nice special effects but the muddled story is distracting. The characters are unmemorable and uninteresting, including Christian Bale as John Conner. He gives a mediocre performance, along with the rest of the cast.<br/><br/>The story is muddled and seems thrown together, as if the writers just said ""to heck with it"" and jammed it all together into a jumbled mess. It is by far the weakest of the Terminator movies.<br/><br/>As an action movie its decent, but not spectacular. I guess if you just want to see a few action scenes with well done special effects, this will fill the bill. Don't expect anything more though."
"fticket","8","3","4","19 November 2010"," A Victim of the Previous Film
","I do not understand the bad reviews for this film. I too agree that it's not T1 or T2. Nor do I think it's fair to expect it to be. James Cameron, before he became stuck up and pretentious, was a great artist and made these films classics.<br/><br/>But it's hard to be 'original' in Part 4; so it's an un-fair cop out to judge this move poorly in regards to 'lack of originality.' At this stage in the franchise, I think what needs to be looked at most is staying true to the story and doing something within the ball-park of what the film should be.<br/><br/>This takes place before much of what we've been told about the Terminator movies does. But it still fits the bill for what T1 and T2 describe about the future. I hear people complaining about giant robots. I'm sorry, did they somehow miss the giant roving tanks and air-craft in the first two films? And what are these complaints about there not being full war scenes? I like the idea of there being specific scenes of action. At this point the humans don't really have an attack plan and are mostly hiding out and trying to re-group after judgment day. The scenes we see in T1 and T2 are long after the events here. Is this really so hard for fans to understand? I think these scenes are more suspenseful than just a giant full-war scenes movie.<br/><br/>And what is funny is to read all the complaints about chase scenes being gone in T3 and 'too many' in T4. Are you people never happy? T4 takes on the concept of humans and machines being blended to a point where it's hard to tell the two apart. Something that would have been more amazing in say 1995. This movie suffers more, than perhaps anything else, from the fact that there isn't too much left to say about sci-fi and robots that hasn't already been covered in the gap from 1991 to 2009. The Terminator movies themselves just took to long to come back and say anything meaningful after T2. And thus by the time they did, it is no longer 'original' because it's been said by ten thousand other sci-fi films. But there is nothing else original really left to be said.<br/><br/>The acting is stiff. Well, excuse me, but this is a war and isn't war stiff? I think the hero shows as much emotion as we are likely to see from a war movie in today's world. Mostly, people are sick of the war. The most a soldier can do is cry, say he wants to go home, and realize that he's already screwed himself. In T1 Kyle was also shown as suppressing his emotions after witnessing the horrors of the future war. The movie was largely about him learning to be human again instead of the 'machine' that he was in the future.<br/><br/>So, we see a humanity that is mostly devoid of emotions, huddling and hiding out, trying to find at a single weakness to attack. We see giant robots a little different than the ones we're used to (as those haven't been built yet) and we see an interesting story that re-connects Kyle into the story.<br/><br/>I see this film as being true both to war and to T1 and T2. While it may not be as overtly dark in tone, it is a solid entry into the franchise that did do its homework (even though it seems many of the fans did not) and tried to do something good.<br/><br/>The only fault I see in this film is not in this film but in the fact that the fans were so disappointed and ticked off by the previous film that they were angry and looking to pick apart any little thing they could in this film that wasn't 'perfect' by their own half-baked standards."

Should have left it at terminator 2 and that is the end of that. But no. So they now have to complete the time line... After that excuse of a movie. I was wondering what on earth is this one gonna be like? Pleasantly surprised. I think Bale did a good job as Connor and brought the film back from the grave. Was he the star of the show? Not in my opinion, Worthington was brilliant as part man, part machine. There will probably be one or two more films to go. I hope they can keep it up. But lets not kid ourselves.

","To be frank, I'm completely and utterly astounded at the amount of vicious reviews that I've seen meted out to this film - whether it's IMDb user reviews or professional critics, it seems that very few people liked this movie. I suppose I can understand that, I just can't wrap my head around the why.<br/><br/>The film is an excellent sequel to the Terminator franchise, and it's certainly a refreshing step up after The Terminator 3.<br/><br/>Christian Bale cuts an imposing figure of leadership, heroism, and sacrifice that any longtime fans of the series would expect from an older John Connor. Sam Worthington's dark portrayal of Marcus Wright draws very deep and unsettling questions about humanity as a whole, and in the end I feel that many people couldn't appreciate the emotional plot depth of the film.<br/><br/>The atmosphere - standard post-apoc washed out grey - is very nice, even if it's a bit overdone; though I can understand how a future where humanity has been driven to the brink of extinction and is mercilessly hunted by machine overlords wouldn't be all that vibrant.<br/><br/>While I felt that the plot of the film was its strongest suit - as it should be - the action in the film left absolutely nothing to be desired. It was tense, pulse-pounding, and virtually bled masculine military procedure, which I'm a huge fan of.<br/><br/>All in all, I saw the film before it received all of this negative press, and I'm completely dumbfounded at why this excellent film, worthy of being a sequel to the Terminator franchise, has been snubbed on such a ridiculous level. I hope the poor critical reception doesn't completely kill the possibility of McG producing another sequel some time in the future!"
"jkd15-1","5","3","4","21 December 2009"," Actor script switch.
","This movie appears to have had a lead and script switch mid shoot. Rare but it does happen. Sam Worthington appears to be the original lead with Bale thrown in last second. This may not be the case but has that feel. So they had to adjust the script to that decision.<br/><br/>I think the John Conners role was going to be a character but not the lead in the movie. He may have even been dead already. Kyle Reese and Marcus Wright were to be the staring pair. And Moon Bloodgood was going to be the female lead and Marcus's romantic as she is in this script version.<br/><br/>My guess is the producers got cold feet and stuck their big noses into the script and actors list and ruined the movie. They probably said, uh oh, we don't have a big name actor.<br/><br/>Personally I think the director purposely ruined the movie because the powers that be ruined the script.<br/><br/>Bale, was terrible and certainly appeared to be out of place. Please, who made him do the Batman voice again. It was bearable in Batman but stupid in this movie.<br/><br/>The director had a great script which would have started the series all over again with Worthington as the half human half terminator. Did you see the scene where they are getting into the jeep and Worthington says to the kid "" Don't look at me like that Star."" It was out of place. Worthington was supposed to have a relationship with the kid. But since the script was destroyed we didn't see any character development to justify that comment.<br/><br/>By the way, Worthington is as good an actor as Bale, maybe better.<br/><br/>Bale was terrible from the start. Out of place and uninspired. Again, I am guessing here, but it appears Bale took the role for the money. He had some free time between gigs and was given this part.<br/><br/>I could see Bale on set, going around to the actors apologizing for stepping all over their movie.<br/><br/>Anyway, what we get as movie goers is a mish mash of scenes that the director tried to give in somewhat of a thoughtful way but without any heart as the true movie had been ruined by untalented, distrusting old men with money. imho<br/><br/>I can see the director sitting in his directors chair and getting a message from upstairs that says "" More CGI and more Bale""<br/><br/>This isn't all that's wrong with this movie but the bulk of what is. Whats with the terminator leeches. Could someone please explain this to me? Oh and what's with the new terminators that look like the robot from an Iron Maiden concert. At one point it looked like one of them was smoking a cigar.<br/><br/>Everything you think is pretty good in this movie is the original script. Anything that seems stupid or out of place, you can call the Bale script."

The first scene where Marcus and Kyle are hunted by a large terminator is now my primary track for benchmarking home theater systems.<br/><br/>I also agree with the comments about ""Rooster""; it was a clever way of tying in the world of Terminators with our own society.<br/><br/>Overall, I was thoroughly impressed. Christian, Sam, and Anton give exceptional performances, and Michael Ironside is a classic touch. The story wasn't as impressive as Terminator 2: Judgement Day or the original Matrix, but sequels rarely can rival their genre originals.

","Spoiler Free Review <br/><br/>Some would wonder why I gave Terminator Salvation 9 stars if I'm already suggesting it's ""No T2"". The answer is simple: I judge franchise sequels not just as stand-alone films, but more importantly how they fit into the franchise, and how they affect it going forward. On these two fronts Terminator Salvation excels.<br/><br/>I have always loved the original Terminator. I really loved T2 as well, but the fact is T2 is Sci-Fi/Action/Adventure/Drama. There were even plenty of humorous parts.<br/><br/>The Terminator, the original, was Sci-Fi/Action, bordering on Sci-Fi/Horror. The idea of machines that never tire and never stop pursuing you, that can kill 50 people to get to you, where ever you are..... that's just plain scary, and in my opinion doesn't leave a lot of room to laugh. My best nightmares feature pursuers like that. Much more thrilling than anything this life has offered so far.<br/><br/>Salvation removes most of the humor and makes the future, and these bad-ass killing machines a little more gritty and unrelenting. Not much time to laugh when death is always approaching. I for one like it better that way.<br/><br/>Many will say this installment doesn't live up to the 1st and 2nd. (forget the 3rd, who's only good scene came at the end - at least the writers had the balls to let Judgement Day happen) I would agree, in some respects. This doesn't have the ""almost-whole family appeal"" of T2, or this human-core of Sarah Connor running for her life in the original. As a matter of fact, other than a few touching moments you could definitely say this one's colder, but again - I would expect nothing but cold and pain, fear and desperation in a future that has humans at war with sentient machines. Even the sound of it. War with Machines. Too awesome.<br/><br/>Bring on the Apocalypse!"

","I cannot understand the bad press at all, after watching this twice its hard to see any truly major flaws in what is a brilliant story driven action movie featuring all the hallmarks of the original two but adding its own great flavor the series.<br/><br/>I won't go into spoilers but generally thee is a great cast at work here, Christian Bale didn't convince me in the trailers but in the film itself he's a competent John Connor, well rounded and flawed but showing the side of him that inspires people. Anton Yelchin plays Kyle Reese here, another recurring character and really sells himself in the role, reminding the audience much of Michael Biehn. However Sam Worthington as Marcus Wright, a new character to the series, almost steals the show providing a real hero for the film whom like Bale is well rounded and drives the plot with enough humanity that we understand what separates us from the machines.<br/><br/>This is the underlying theme of all the Terminator films and it really gains ground here with the destructive war showing the real horror of the Terminators in all their various forms and a shocking surprise at the end providing a great insight into how intricately a killer mastermind Skynet really is, as well as providing a real highlight for long term fans. The style serves all this well, with thrilling and well realized action scenes orchestrated beautifully by Mcg and the design of the machines themselves often being quite creepy, with an unsettling side to their metal skulls and glowing eyes, they really are portrayed well, giving a sense of how cold and calculating they are. Some really intense scenes early on set the tone for the entire movie and provide my favorite movie of the summer.<br/><br/>For long term fans of the series, the next two films in this planned trilogy will likely decide how worth the wait this installment was but ultimately it has set the stage for what could be a brilliant close to the series and finally showing us the war we've been waiting for. McG deserves the chance to make the next two because here he has managed to re-launch a once great series on the verge of decay. Now its alive and stronger than ever, with the story we all really wanted since we saw the first film. Go see it now, its worth your time."

They would have to resist against the machines for mankind's very survival. Unfortunately for the resisters, the machines were stronger, faster, and more durable making them a difficult if not impossible enemy to fight. That part was pretty straight forward, but what was impressive was the movie had also personal struggles for Jon Connor and Marcus Right. This sometimes would start to get confusing, but it made the characters seem more interesting than just some randomly created idiots carrying guns.<br/><br/>So the story is pretty impressive, but what's better yet was the action and pace of Terminator: Salvation. Of course with the name Terminator, automatically you'd know this would be an action movie. It's mot that of the ""typical action"" movie though. There are a lot of surprises or sudden sequences that will throw you into no thoughts but of the movie. Better yet, it's not lame or stupid where there are unrealistic scenes flashing. Terminator: Salvation focused on a strong pace of action, and thoughts carried out to scenes of the movie of ""what would we do if real terminators really tried exterminating us?"" The answer to those questions would be in the scenes.<br/><br/>Overall, the acting is pretty good, though I do have some issues with it. Christian Bale would sometimes overact, especially in the beginning. A theory for that is either Jon Connor is a hot headed exaggerated character, or Christian simply messed up. Marcus Right was well acted though. His confusion and rage was well acted throughout the whole movie which was fairly impressive.<br/><br/>Concluding, Terminator: Salvation was a well acted and well polished action movie topped with a dramatic story. I strongly recommend that people who haven't yet seen Terminator: Salvation go do so."
"ShinKyo81","8","3","4","7 June 2009"," I don't understand the bad reviews at all...
","I'm not going to talk about the movie in detail (there are plenty of reviews about that). Instead, enough to say that it's an action-packed, enjoyable ride in the Terminator universe, with an OK plot and average actor performances. Since I knew McG was behind the camera, it was obvious the movie would not turn out as shiny as we wanted, but I enjoyed my time through the two-hour length of the film. Not an academy award best motion picture winner, but really enjoyable in the end. Great photography, jaw-dropping special effects with a balanced mixture between real and CGI elements, eye-candy believable terminator machines (don't know what bashers were expecting) and some enjoyable characters which lead the movie with such small effort.<br/><br/>It gets to my nerves that lately everybody is waiting for the GREATEST MOVIE EVER MADE every time they go to the theatres. You may think I am being too indulgent with McG, Christian ""tantrum"" Bale and the whole crew, but I had a good time enjoying this piece of visual entertainment which is Terminator Salvation. So if you are planning to have a nice time at your local theatre, give it a try. If you are ticking your Academy Awards' nominees list, just draw a cross in this one and move along. Otherwise, buckle up and enjoy the ride! :) 8/10"
"Leightonthegreat","9","3","4","3 June 2009"," Terminator Salvation never had a chance with some critics.....
","When i heard they would make yet another Terminator i thought Oh God Please No! Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines, wasn't actually a bad film in my opinion, its a good film. The problem T3 has, is how amazing the original two were. Terminator: Salvation, did i expect it would deliver when going into the cinema? Not hugely, i expected nothing close to Terminator 1 or 2, and lets face it, why should we, they are two among the best Sci-Fi films ever to be made. Did it deliver? Yes, of course it did. It is an extremely well made movie. I believe this film was doomed by some critics before it was released. First off, Terminator Salvation does what we want, plot development. John Connor being the weakest of all of them, with Kyle Reese being excellent. The audience meeting Kyle when he was younger, its great how much alike this actor is too the Kyle of the first film. Very well casted. The action is great, its fast moving, it never leaves you feeling bored, so its an all round great film, and doesn't get lost in CGI and become a big exploding mess. Also the references to the original Terminator is great i love the little traits. What i do have a problem with in a respect is how little the actual story is documented. The first two films done this extremely well, especially the second. i do feel maybe John Connor is a bit weak at times, but the other characters more than make up for it! maybe also the chase scenes are not as great as the other 3 films, but a film as a whole, its pulse racing. Being introduced to the T-600 as well was really great, nice to see the younger models. It isn't the same as the first 3 films in the fact its a different kettle of fish, it barely documents an actual terminator like the previous 3 done so well... yes you may argue there were loads of Terminators, but even Marcus didn't have the scale that Arnie's T-800 was given in the first two films. (I don't mean screen time) I think this is a brilliant film though, and it doesn't deserve any bad press at all, if this didn't have Terminator attached people would be saying it was one of the greatest films in a long while, people just want to pick at something. So its better than T3, its nearly as good as Terminator 2 and i personally think on a level with Terminator. What is there to complain about? They could have made a god awful film and churned it out too make money like they have with many franchises, we should be thankful a film of this excellence was released. Great film 8.5/10"

","If you are going to read any review... read this one. Is this a good movie? No... The script/dialogue in the movie is absolutely pathetic. Seriously, it could have been written by a 5 year-old with an IQ of 24... There are maybe 2 lines in the entire movie that contain more than 15 words. Christian Bale needs to get rid of the Batman Begins/Dark Knight voice and speak normally. The sideshow love stories made the movie miserable and extremely pathetic. The CGI/special effects were good, but the sound was obnoxious. Very, very unrealistic... Almost everyone in the future seems happy and very well kept. Where is the time for perfect hygiene? A P.O.S. Jeep that has been sitting for 10 years would not run... Gasoline goes bad and inert... And please for the love of god will some director make an effin movie where people reload their weapons!!!! How can you shoot 85 times with a 30 round mag? McG or whatever his name is ripped off soooo many scenes from the other movies and horribly at that. Acting from almost everyone is terrible. Common??? I mean, pshhhh, please... The commander from Starship Troopers... HAHAHAHAHAHA WHAT A JOKE! And if that's not the best part... Just wait for the awful CGI Arnold and the worst/cliché/most sissy ending you have ever seen. Basically, I am just really frustrated I spent $10 bucks and 2 hours of my time on such a piece...

","I was hyped after seeing the theatrical trailer. Finally, we were going to see the war against the machines.<br/><br/>I just got back from the pre-screening. Unfortunately, T4 was disappointing from the weak title sequence. Essentially the movie contains lots of explosions, a sprinkling of gobots and plenty of scenes that just seem - unbelievable (without the wonder).<br/><br/>Sam Worthington does a good job with his role as Marcus, Nicolas Cage (or was it Tom Cruise) is angry as John Connor, and Michael Ironside is resolute as Michael Ironside from Total Recall.<br/><br/>Here's my Terminator 4 'Homestyle' Recipe:<br/><br/>1/4 Cup - Blackhawk Down soldiering scenes, 5grams - Road Warrior car battles, 2oz - Matrix harvesting robots, 1turd - Transformers (sans Megan Fox), 1gram - Resident Evil evil, 1fist - Mission Impossible impossibles.<br/><br/>Stir together, add some average extras, a cute kid and a really uninspired score from the talented Danny Elfman then bake for 2hours.<br/><br/>The only thing this movie is missing is a scene where a T-600 mows down a puppy with a Gatling gun, just so we know they are totally bad-ass.<br/><br/>Actually, the T-600 are totally bad-ass, plus surprisingly stupid. They bring all the joy from every minigun experience you've always wanted. A nice homage to modern games such as Return to Castle Wolfenstein, Team Fortress 2, and countless others where gamers fixate on spending endless rounds of ammo without hitting anything.<br/><br/>If you enjoyed Matrix 2 and 3, the last Batman, Gears of War, Call of Duty: Modern Combat (great game BTW, way more involving story than this movie), and Cheetohs you just might like this. <br/><br/>Makes you really appreciate classics like Terminator 2, Aliens, and Bladerunner. Those movies have mood, pacing, great use of effects, and vision."
"EasternZZ","4","4","6","19 October 2018"," Worst Terminator
","People give Genisys a bad rep, but Salvation is a lot worst. Terminator is Arnold's movie, and when you force a plot into a movie to try to continue the story, but you also try to bring the old stories and mix them with the new ones, you get a huge mess of a film. This movie wants to be a new movie from the original 2 movies, but they keeping bringing up dialogue of similar cool stuff from the originals into this movie.<br/><br/>The action is just ok for the most part, but the highlight is the final 30 minutes where you get to see what happens inside a Terminator factory. Bale is doing his best, but he looks bored and probably only did this movie for the big bucks.<br/><br/>The worst thing about this movie is the story. If you have great action, then a story wouldn't matter. Unfortunately the original Terminator films were usually very high on story and had deep themes about human survival, and yet still delivered on great action. This movie has none of that.<br/><br/>Honestly, I think Genisys is a way better film because it doesn't try to continue the story of the Terminator films, it creates an alternate timeline and a great ""what if"" scenario.<br/><br/>4/10 (Only worth watching for the CGI Arnold cameo at the end of the movie)"
"zardoz-13","9","4","6","4 July 2015"," Slam Bang Actioneer with Christian Bale As John Connor
","The fourth entry in the ""Terminator"" franchise ""Terminator Salvation"" doesn't topline Arnold Schwarzenegger. The legendary Austrian bodybuilder appears strictly as a CGI character in a cameo as he looked in James Cameron's original ""Terminator,"" and he doesn't utter any of his signature lines of dialogue. Despite the absence of Arnold, this superbly produced epic qualifies as excellent in every respect, and McG stages everything with the word spectacular in mind. Skynet deploys its devastating Hunter-Killer helicopters that possess vertical engines like a Harrier Jump Jet. The T-101 terminators appear by the scores, and Skynet has a gigantic exoskeleton robot with a mini-Vulcan cannon mounted atop its towering physique. Furthermore, they have water creatures that resemble spines with pincers for mouths. The Resistance counters these forces with A-10 attack jets, and they maintain their headquarters aboard a submarine at sea so as to elude detection by Skynet. This larger-than-life tale initially transpires in the wastelands and then the action moves to Skynet headquarters. Iconically , one of the important things that this movie does is show us how Connor acquired his distinctive facial scar. <br/><br/>Christian Bale takes over the role of John Connor, the chief Resistance leader, in McG's sci-fi action adventure fantasy that takes place during the war between Mankind and Machines after Judgment Day. Skynet is headquartered in San Francisco, and a former convicted murderer, Marcus Wright (Sam Worthington of ""Avatar""), plays an important role in this installment. Wright decides to donate his body to science after he is executed; Dr. Serena Kogan (Helen Bonham Carter of ""Fight Club"") persuaded Wright to make his final contribution and they converted him to being a machine. Later, he learns that he was designed to infiltrate the resistance and locate Kyle Reese (Anton Yelchin), and Marcus succeeds in his mission. Unfortunately, Marcus and Kyle are separated during a Skynet attack. During an aerial attack with Skynet hunter-killer helicopters, a pilot Blair Williams (Moon Bloodgood of ""Falling Skies""), stumbles onto Marcus after she survives a plane crash. When they plunge into a minefield on the way to Blair's resistance base, Marcus trips a mine and winds up in captivity. Marcus convinces Connor that he didn't know that he was a Terminator. Meantime, the Resistance is poised to bomb Skynet, and Connor struggles to convince General Ashdown (Michael Ironsides of ""Starship Troopers"") that he cannot destroy the Skynet camp without killing Reese. Ashdown doesn't seem to know how vital Kyle's life is to the Resistance. Connor disobeys Ashdown launches a one-man assault on Skynet with Marcus' help. Marcus ends up saving Connor during a fracas with a Terminator.<br/><br/>""Terminator Salvation"" contemplates what distinguishes mankind from machines. At the end, Skynet's global network remains intact, but the Resistance has won a victory. Christian Bale is good as John Connor, and Sam Worthington rivals him as Marcus Wright, a Terminator who retains enough vestiges of his humanity to triumph over the machine makeover that Skynet has performed on him. ""Terminator Salvation"" is memorable for many reasons. First, we see Skynet's vast new arsenal of weapons. Second, we get a macro sense of the overall command structure of the Resistance."

"mgyldz","4","4","6","11 August 2009"," Could've been much better
","Christian Bale is a good actor, our Charlie Barltlett is there (Anton Yelchin), and to my surprise, Helena Bonhem Carter pops up. Everything could be so good.<br/><br/>This movie seriously lacks a story. I expected a plot based on John Connor struggling to become the savior of mankind, but it is based on a man named Marcus that we don't care about. Then he is revealed to be a half human machine (by the way, how could Skynet did it really, when it just got the technology to produce T-800s?), with a mission to infiltrate human resistance. He doesn't know his mission, but Skynet expects him to carry it out and obey. Whatever. I expected him to be revealed as a far superior model, sent from distant future by John Connor, to protect Kyle Reese. That could've been a much satisfying plot twist.<br/><br/>The film also suffers from bad directing. There are blazing fires everywhere around the machine city that tells us the director is a man who overuses the word ""cool"". Skynet defenses are pathetic, the prisoners walk out safely, air support comes without opposition, and John has to deal with one or two (I don't remember, one T-600 and one T-800 I suppose) machines to go in and out. Plain silly.<br/><br/>The movie ends with so cliché words that it reminds us that this movie is a product manufactured by extremely boring people who do their job, get paid and be done with it. James Cameron 'wanted' to make a good movie and he made it real. This is a blunt action movie with a bad script and worse directing."

He's no James Cameroon but i'll tell you , the reason why he failed is because he tried too hard !<br/><br/>Background scores were a let down , the legendary spine chilling music is limited to the credits of the film ! The robots look weaker than they ought to be and the Resistance seemed dumber than they should be ! Christian Bale's talent was wasted , and he had almost no scope to perform , but seriously dude what's with the Batman voice , snap out of it ! The plot is simple enough to understand , you'd always know what'll happen next! <br/><br/>Well coming to the film , the first half drags and the second half is much better ! What this film really misses is good old Arnie chasing the bad guys ! My favourite part is the short 3 minute appearance of the animated Arnie(T-800) ,it lit the whole theater on fire !

"gautam_milan","9","4","6","26 June 2009"," critics don't have a clue........
","OK i just watched the movie and i seriously liked it.after i walked out of theater i was thinking why movie was so much critically panned.lets face it every movie cannot be great but from a common moviegoer perspective and a follower of terminator film franchise this one was quite good and i say good enough to be mentioned in same breath with other two movies of the series discarding the third one. Plot of the movie was simple and intriguing.it was easy to follow and some might say thats predictability of storyline but i say thats where the screenwriters and director have got their act right.one of my apprehension about the movie was plot may be too convoluted that might have triggered such a backlash from the critics but that certainly wasn't the case. Much of the criticism have been directed towards Christian bale for giving a ranting loud angry performance but common guys think straight.This guy is playing the sole hope of human race.everything depends upon him and he needs to get his act right.he has to mean business and here business is quite a serious one of protecting his people and bringing down the sky net.of course he cannot crack jokes wink at others pretending its just another fine day.he has to look like a guy on mission having unwavering determination towards his goal n Bale succeeds in doing that.anyways bale has to be one of the finest actor of his generation and he shows his class here. Sam Worthington was truly worthy of the role because he played it with almost genius .truly a character with whom audiences can relate as both are thrust into a unknown world post judgement day.he carries the mantle of a protector/terminator as good as Arnold did in other movies.he certainly grabbed attention and sometimes overshadowing other in his presence. Anton yelchin did justice with his role of young kyle Reese.his vulnerability and still the determination to earn a place in coveted resistance should have won hearts over. Action is the high point of the movie with truly remarkable special effects and giant robots.action was properly paced neither too mind numbing no too less.MCG direction was cool and some of the shots n cinematography was breathtaking. at last i don't know which movie critics watched but i know for me the movie that i watched was worth my money n worth my wait."

"tburke85","8","4","6","29 May 2009"," Terminator Salvation Is An Entertaining Sci-fi Action Adventure
","Let me first start off by saying that after reading some very harsh reviews for Terminator Salvation I went in thinking it was going to be one of the worst movies ever but to my surprise the movie definitely wasn't as bad as many critics say it is. I found it to be a worthy entry into the Terminator series. It may not be as good as Judgment Day but it's much better than the first one (which was good but with some flaws) and Rise Of The Machines. The third film by Jonathan Mostow was okay but I couldn't buy that Skynet would send back a woman terminator to once again attempt to kill John Connor. No offense to Kristana Loken who played the villain in the third film. She did a good job with what she was given and everyone else in it did a decent job but the movie become kind of corny. It was basically the same plot of the first one a terminator from the future is sent back to the past to either kill Sarah Connor or her son and a guardian is sent to protect them. Terminator Salvation is set after Judgement Day where man is at war with the powerful machines of Skynet that has taken over Earth. The desolate wasteland in the movie looked very real and everyone involved did a great job of bringing this apocalyptic world to life. I don't get all the negative reviews for this movie. The people in the theater I went to also seemed to enjoy it. Some have complained about Christian Bale's performance and that he's not in that much. I for one thought Bale turns in a solid performance as John Connor who's climbing the ranks to become the leader of the resistance. Bale brings an intensity and vulnerability to the character. Connor isn't that punk kid played by Edward Furlong in T2 who did do a good job with that character, or the off the grid bum like Nick Stahl's in T3 who did a decent job with that role as well. Bale's Connor is a grown man who knows he's fated for something great but has doubts whether they can win this war against the machines. As for Bale using his Batman voice as Connor. It didn't really sound like the voice he uses for that character at least not to me. Maybe a little similar at times but he didn't talk like that throughout the whole film. I also read complaints about his character yelling a lot. Well if you were put into the situation these people were in the movie I think just about anyone would be yelling. With movies like The Dark Knight, Batman Begins, and American Psycho, Christian Bale continues to show why he's one of Hollywoods best actors today. I thought he got just as much screen time as his co-star newcomer Sam Worthington. Yeah for a little while the movie did seem to center a little more on Worthington since Bale does sit out action wise for a while except the beginning and towards the climax but in the end I'd say their screen time was about even. Sam Worthington does a good job playing the mysterious character Marcus Wright. Marcus is on death row for an unknown crime when we first meet him in the year 2003 and he signs his body over to Cyberdine for experimental research. Wright does an excellent job portraying Marcus as a man looking for a second chance at redemption who isn't exactly who he seems to be. There are some secrets about Marcus that are revealed later on in the film which were surprising. If you've seen the trailer for the movie then you already know Marcus isn't who he appears and that his character is either there to help John Connor or kill him. Equally impressive was Anton Yelchin as a young Kyle Reese who will one day become John's father when he is sent back in time by Connor to protect his mother and fall in love with her so that he will be born. Yelchin did a terrific job of making you believe this was a young version of the character in the first one played by Michael Biehn who also did a great with the role. Well done. The rest of the cast did a good job in their supporting roles including Moon Bloodgood, Bryce Dallas Howard, Common, Michael Ironside, and Helena Bonham Carter in a very brief role. There's also a brief blink and missed it cameo by someone from the previous films thanks to the work of some great CGI. Terminator Salvation does have intense action sequences that are well paced but it's also a story about John Connor's rise to leadership and Marcus Wright's quest for redemption two very different men who must put aside their differences and join in a common goal to save teenager Kyle Reese from Skynet before the machines take over for good. Director McG did an admirable job of bringing this movie to the big screen from the rousing action and battle sequences to the realistic apocalyptic wasteland that the world has turned into because of the machines that are relentless in their efforts to exterminate the human race. Overall Terminator Salvation is an entertaining sci-fi action adventure with some flaws with character development and minor plot holes but I still thought it was decent much better than Rise of the Machines. It's sure to entertain anyone who enjoys non-stop action, fist fights, explosions, chases, some character development (Bale and Worthington), drama, suspense, and thrills with incredible special effects that marvels those that can be found in Michael Bay's Tranformers. If you're a fan of Judgment Day than chances are you'll enjoy this one too. Go see it. Don't believe all the negative reviews by critics. Much better than expected despite it's few problems."

The story had so many plot holes that it was hard to follow, they made kyle reese into a pussy. you could even tell that Christian bale didn't care to be there. had a terribly cliché ending. the script was not well written at all, its like they took parts from the other terminators, and a few other movies, and just threw them into a storm called ""terminator salvation.""

","Family relations? Favours among friends? Blackmail? Insanity? Whatever it is, there has to be an explanation up those alleys for someone letting McG (Joseph McWhatever) direct and having the masterminds of Catwoman write the story of a movie of these proportions, people who hardly have written anything else in their lives, except the most ridiculed and trashed movie throughout human existence. If you watch this movie the way you watch a parody of a horribly bad movie making style of the past (i.e. porn movie plots and porn movie realism in human behavior/dialog), then you can get through this movie and enjoy it. That's how I did it. <br/><br/>Example: Marcus awakes, gets attacked by a Terminator, asks Kyle Reese: - ""What was that?"". Kyle answers: - ""A Terminator"". Marcus ponders no more. No questions like ""what's going on, what am I doing here, why do my arms feel like robot arms, where is what, who is who, how did everything happen, who made the robots, why do they want to kill us"". No questions. No amazement. No reaction. Just a stupid look and business as usual. ""I'm going North"", he says. Of course. That's where any Mad Max/Resident Evil 4/text-adventure game from the 80s player would go. North. For no reason. <br/><br/>And so it goes on, until the end: John Connor gets operated on in sandy desert wind, instead of inside a tent or a building. That's the lowest point throughout the movie. It's not cheesy and stupid, it's something worse. Marcus is like ""I'm a bad-ass, murderer, a human terminator who should survive on a Terminator power cell (another dumb ""plot before attention to realism"" mistake), I'm your greatest asset this time around, but sure I'll die, here's my heart. Everyone deserves a second chance, but I deserve to die now. Yes. Have a nice day, good bye"". <br/><br/>The special effects earned it a rating of 5, though they were ruined in day light shots by cheap-looking filters reducing color saturation, common in B-series on TV ever since Saving Private Ryan set the standard for the phenomena of filter-credibility, to be abused ever since. 'B-series' is the keyword to describe the atmosphere in the movie if you disregard the special effects. Only in a B-series do you expect a Terminator to survive rifle fire in one scene, die from it in the next, taking several grenade launcher hits standing up in one scene and getting blown 100 feet backwards from a single shot 5 seconds later. McG (or Zorro, as he'd probably prefer to be called if that name wasn't taken, despite his fear of flying making him drop out of Superman 4 due to filming in Australia) compared the making of the movie with Apocalypse Now, in the sense of the gritty, explosive realism. The only valid comparison is that both movies where in Development Hell at one time, but Apocalypse pulled through. Terminator: Salvation is still there, but was, for some strange reason, released to the public anyway."

","This film faithfully continues the storyline of the first 2 terminator films. In fact it mainly references the first one right down to use of familiar elements that gave me wonderfully nostalgic goosebumps. The tone is different for sure, more despairing and yes less humourless because this is about the future after Judgement Day. A world ruled by machines with pockets of human resistance.<br/><br/>The story is great with a couple of wonderful twists. And towards the end there is a superb surprise that will rock the fans...well it rocked for me. The action sequences were relentlessly thrilling and tremendous in scope which to me is a tribute to Cameron's throw everything including the kitchen sink, action filming methods.<br/><br/>he story of John Connors is actually a back story. Another mysterious character hold centre stage most of the time and the actor who plays him has great presence and star quality. I thought the film was intelligent and well acted for this sort of genre. The future is depicted very much as in the glimpses we see in the first 2 Terminator movies. Though not as darkly lit!<br/><br/>This is a magnificent entry and I simply cannot fathom why this movie is panned by so many. And its not just the critics who are panning it, but more bizarrely, fans of the original. Its sad, because this film deserves its sequel but I fear it will not get it. It probably will be made but as a low budget straight to DVD trash. Sad because this was a truly great entry. My biggest surprise is how MCG, the man who directed the 2 enjoyable but tongue in cheek and nonsensical Charlie Angels films, pulled off such a seriously cool big scale thrill ride of a movie."

","When Terminator 2 is about ready to roll credits, Sarah talks about a machine learning the importance of a human life, why can't we?

The story is flat, and there are a few actions scenes thrown in to keep people interested.<br/><br/>I think you have to be a fan of the series to really enjoy this movie. I have been watching them since they have been around and this one was a great Terminator film(tied with the first for number 1 in my book).<br/><br/>I used to wonder what the Future War would be like, and Skynet's Terminator factory would look like. Some scenes had me on the edge of my seat. I cheered for Arnold's CGI face on another actor's body. I felt like there wasn't enough time spent of some of the newer things in the series that no one in the movie talked about. Judgment Day came, so I don't know why critics are screaming there was a flat story. We all went into this knowing that all was lost and it was going to be a complicated fight against Skynet the entire movie. This movie is really more for the fans who are waiting to see the day Connor sends Reese back through time, and completes the saga's circle."

","I am sad to say Director McG destroyed this franchise. His casting was terrible. Christian Bale is a great edgy character actor. He could not sell the audience he is the kind hearted John Connor. Bale should have been the Terminator. Sam Worthington would have been a better choice as John Connor. McG story telling at best was confusing. The story was all over the place with weak dialog. The visual effects looked great but they did not help tell the story. They actually made it more confusing because most of the time they had no purpose. His many battle scenes went on so long that they became boring. McG put in a lot of nonsense. Example, Connor has a piece of iron the size of a 2x4 plunged in to his chest that protrudes out his back. The next scene he is on the operating table looking like he was there for a yearly check up and the doctor say I think he has a bad heart. The movie is bad, boring, ridiculous and a big disappointment. Not even a good rental."
"sparkletight","Null","39","103","19 May 2009"," Should have been Epic
","This film is rife with cheesy b-movie schtick and implausibilities. It starts out OK, with minimal character development and some perfunctory action, but eventually fizzles out in the third act. As far as I can remember, nothing truly interesting happens. Yes, there's action galore, but it's ham-fisted and uninspired. I nodded off a half dozen times in the last 20 minutes and left the theater in a sleepy haze with not much of a memory of what I had just seen.<br/><br/>Bale is just OK as John Connor, utilizing the same vocal affect he used in The Dark Knight, while the other guy, having what seemed like more screen presence, still just wasn't given much material to work with. The characters are essentially cartoons and not very interesting ones at that. As such I felt very little if any empathy for any of the characters.<br/><br/>I expect 9 to 16 years olds might like this movie but then, that's probably the target audience based in part on the PG-13 rating.<br/><br/>In the end, this is a forgettable action film that will be Christian Bale's ""Catwoman""."

I must say that the movie started off really good, and the post Judgement Day was shown really nicely. The ending could've been a little better but comparing to the overall movie, it can be neglected for its shortcoming. The two things that totally dazzled me were the sound and special effects. The new models and the fighting sequences are all great. This is a totally ""edge of the seat"" movie. The references to the other movies were nicely done. Overall, I give it a 9.5. A great effort by Mcg. Looking forward to the 5th one now. And for sure, John Connor should be played by Christan Bale again in the 5th one. He is perfect for the role."
"CA_movie_fan","4","9","18","22 May 2009"," Really disappointing - more Transformers than Terminator
","I'm really surprised to see how the Terminator franchise continually gets trashed by different directors. James Cameron's original premise sets up one of the greatest movie villains of all time against a hero with one of the biggest challenges of all time, and never lets go of its audience, creating a suspenseful sci-fi/horror story that's really second to none. Yet after the first two films, it's gone downhill from there.<br/><br/>Undoubtedly the special effects are the star of this film, with flawless photo-realistic CGI in the majority of shots. The industrial look of the machines is new and really helps to sell the concept that these things exist. At the end of the movie (SPOILERS), Arnold makes a reappearance as a T-800 looking the same age as he did in 1984, which was apparently achieved entirely through digital composition. It's as seamless as the photographic effect used in The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, and is the only point of the film where our audience applauded. Some of the other CGI suffered from speed/scale problems where machines seemed to move too fast to be real.<br/><br/>Terminator Salvation plot-wise is a mess, relying on a substantial knowledge of the previous films, and never really linking one sequence to the next. The main theme is that there's a 'kill switch' signal that can be broadcast to bring down the machines, while the appearance of a new character reveals a new prototype of machine that Skynet has built. And then there's about 120 minutes of non-stop action in between attempting to connect these two stories. There are huge leaps of logic too: the machines don't try to kill Marcus because he is a machine, but they tried to at the beginning before the audience knows that. Then in the final action sequence Arnold inexplicably disappears mid-sequence to allow John two minutes of expositionary dialog. During that period, I literally have no idea where he goes.<br/><br/>As for Arnold, they use every trick from the last films to finish him off, but apparently the T-800 is now impervious to molten lava, freezing and grenades. MAJOR SPOILER: in a clear indication of endless rewrites, the Terminator sticks a metal pole through John's chest (yes, actually *through* his chest) and in the next scene he is limping out of there awaiting a heart transplant like it's a flesh wound. At this point, we had officially lost cabin pressure on this film altogether.<br/><br/>The characters, for what they are, are one-dimensional at best, mostly existing to shout at each other or get killed. Even Bryce Dallas Howard's character (presumably John Connor's wife?) is never introduced or developed and seems to act only as a reflection to give John dialog. And actually, when they talk it's the only time in the whole film that people aren't yelling. Sam Worthington stole the show as Marcus, but even then it seemed his character arc was centered around ""woe is me, I'm a machine"".<br/><br/>Location-wise, we move from a gas station in the desert to submarines to helicopters to factories, without any sense of why we go from one place to the next. Even the idea of Skynet collecting humans in concentration camps is there for the imagery and little else (Skynet has become a chess player from the TV series onwards, whereas it was just a destroyer in Cameron's vision). And they now have robots that range from squid- like devices all the way up to 200-foot tall machines, which was more Transformers than Terminator, especially since they can contain motorbikes.<br/><br/>All I can say is that I'm really disappointed. This seems an easy franchise to extend for any skilled director, and fans have been wanting to see Future War since the inception of the series. This is the sort of film that Michael Bay or Jerry Bruckheimer produce: loud, confused, pointless and designed for the A.D.D. generation that just wants rapid bursts of endless action. T3 doesn't even look bad now, and the TV show is looking like Shakespeare compared to this."
"milesflatt","1","12","26","26 May 2009"," Awful; Don't See
","I love almost all movies. I especially love the terminator series and franchise. the first two are amazing there's no doubt about that while the third is definitely lacking in many respects but this new Terminator Salvation movie is the biggest piece of Sh*t I have seen in a long time. Not only does it suck but it also kills the series as a whole. This actually ensures that the future Terminator movies are going to suck.<br/><br/>The movie has more holes than any other movie I've previously watched and I'm not talking about things like ""oh that would never happen"" or ""thats not possible"". Obviously its a sci-fi movie so things aren't like our own world but this movie is just way over the top. Somehow John Connor just happens to make it all by himself to the Sky Net HQ completely safe and undetected. He might of well just gone alone as soon as the war started and just destroyed sky net himself if it was that easy. Another thing that p*ssed me off was how dispensable all of the Resistance's weapons and technology was. The resistance just throws Jets and helicopters like they can just build more instantly like some video game. THAT IS JUST RETARTED. The resistance would be valuing every weapon and bomb and plane they had since the machines would def not allow them to build at some undisclosed location and especially since everything has just been nuked.<br/><br/>The acting isn't even that great either. No character is especially moving or captivating at all. The weird romance aspect between Marcus and the female pilot is just so meaningless its funny. What really angered me off was the surprise visit from a DIGITALIZED Arnold. If there going to put Arnold in for a bit at least make him talk. A good ""F**k You As***le"" would have been nice.<br/><br/>There are about 2 good action sequences maybe and a lot of explosion's. Thats all the praise i will give it. There aren't any big cool war scenes between massive amounts of machines against resistance fighters like in the flash forwards of the other terminator movies. The ""cool"" future war is not cool at all.<br/><br/>So please, whatever you see, don't see Terminator Salvation because it simply sucks.<br/><br/>PS. IF YOU LIKE THE PREVIOUS 3 TERMINATORS Definitely DO NOT SEE THIS BECAUSE YOU WILL JUST BE P*SSED OFF WHEN YOU LEAVE."

","i have been waiting for so long for this movie to come out, but i was let down. The first three Terminators are absolutely amazing, but Salvation does almost no justice to them. It has all the characteristics of a bad movie done by a bad director. Each scene was very limited with the amount of actors and the scope of the field of view. Some scenes looked like they were filmed in someone's living room with cardboard walls and only one camera angle. The very few open-air scenes of the devastation contained ridiculous CG that looks like it came from the '80s. All of the graphics were hideous compared to that which were in Rise of the Machines. Salvation lacks good quality dialect and is riddled with numerous inconsistencies with the real Terminator movies. The acting is so cold, just like what is found is George Romero's zombie movies, no character development. There were some very cool, but very brief action scenes, which was pleasing. Extreme ignorance was the driving force behind the plot and the movie as a whole. Many plot-holes. i am still in a state of shock; how could someone do this? Very much an insult."
"hitchcockthelegend","8","6","11","17 June 2012"," You and me, we've been at war since before either of us existed.
","Terminator Salvation is directed by McG and and written by John Brancato and Michael Ferris. It stars Christian Bale, Sam Worthington, Anton Yelchin, Moon Bloodgood, Bryce Dallas Howard and Common. Music is scored by Danny Elfman and cinematography by Shane Hurlbut.<br/><br/>2018 and John Connor (Bale) is a key figure in the Resistance forces waging war against Skynet and their Terminator armies. But when Marcus Wright (Worthington) wanders into the equation it clouds the issues, with both men desperate to establish meaning and answers in the war......<br/><br/>The weight of expectation was massive. Spread over a 25 year period and harvesting 3 films, the Terminator film fan has wanted to desperately view the post Judgement Day war between man and machine. Over to you McG; yep, he who directed Charlie's Angels! Box office wise it's a winner of some magnitude, garnering over $370 million worldwide (over $170 million profit), but critics and franchise fans, perhaps inevitably, were decidedly mixed on its worth to the Terminator universe. It's good for me, a fan also of the series, to come to the film some three years after it was released, where the hype or venom has evaporated and the film has finally found a base footing from which to be judged.<br/><br/>Undeniably it is some way away from the first two Cameron films, lacking the lesser budget sci-fi grit of part one or the mind bending extravagance of part 2. Better than 3 for sure, but that film still has the best ending of all the Terminator movies. Terminator Salvation is a darn great action movie, in fact it's more a great action/war movie that has dashes of Terminator folklore sprinkled along the way. Gone is the pursuer/pursued structure of the previous films, in place now is a tough guys on a mission adventure story, fast paced and full to the brim of plot and barn-storming action set pieces. There's no easy cop out here either, the makers could quite easily have made one long battle movie between Bale's Beefcakes and Skynet's Super Soldiers, but instead they serve up different conflicts at different points of the apocalyptic compass. With many brilliant new additions to the Skynet's army adding spice to the Cyborg laden stew. This is not just an endoskeleton wasteland, it's a land of Hunter-Killer ships, hulking Harvesters, underwater Hydrobots and Terminator motorcycles. The sci-fi, in design and execution, is quite frankly adrenalin pumping.<br/><br/>With the picture set as it is, post the other films in the series, it does have a huge waft of freshness on its side. Yes there's dutiful nods to the past, courtesy of one liners, music and a familiar face in the finale, these are welcome and needed by the fans in fact, but McG's movie stands tall on its own two feet. No lazy remake here, even if the staging of the final dust-up is a series copy. The writers have also imbued the story with darkness, it's as fun as it gets on a visceral level at times, but there's a bleakness, a sadness, constantly hovering in the dry air. It's also a neat trick having John Connor, the future saviour of mankind, not be this super-human guy loved by all, he carries emotional baggage, obviously, but to some of his superiors he is viewed as edgy, perhaps even a hindrance to the war effort? It's a nice thread and harks back to the young Connor's arrogant streak in T2.<br/><br/>Cast performances have also proved to get mixed reviews, but now the dust has died down it appears that nobody is bad here. Bale and Worthington make for a nice muscular pairing without pushing the acting boat out, Bloodgood holds her own in kicking ass and dialogue exchanges and Yelchin, who I initially struggled to accept as someone who is going to blossom into the moody and magnificent Michael Biehn version, does a decent enough job of setting Rees up for his inevitable fate. Outside of these main performers, though, nobody gets much of a look in, which in the case of Bryce Dallas Howard's wife of John Connor is a shame. The writers have erred here, for surely she is a critical component of the John Connor character arc? Still, we do at least get a fun, but staple, cameo from Michael Ironside. Terminator Salvation's worst mistake, mind, is to not finish 10 minutes earlier than it did, where the build up and set up for potential sequels is dampened considerably by a mushy tack on sequence, a chance to keep things moody and ambivalent is wasted, seemingly for the popcorn munchers pleasure.<br/><br/>It was never going to be an across the board winner, especially for Terminator's staunch fans. Only Cameron coming back could have maybe brought about the film everyone wanted? But this is still a ripper of an action movie, with enough brains and balls to standalone. Awesome Blu-ray too! 7.5/10"

It comes to Connor's knowledge that he is no longer the primary target, he is secondary. Skynet's chosen to terminate John's father, Kyle Reese (Anton Yelchin), before he can be sent back in time.<br/><br/>Great casting, directing, action sequences, special effects and visual effects and make-up make this film everlasting. Sam Worthington and Helena Bonham Carter do an excellent job in their supporting roles. I especially like the music, provided by my favourite composer, Danny Elfman.<br/><br/>It's full of action throughout and finally, for the die-hard fans, we get to see the future. Previously, Skynet has always sent Terminators back in time, but now we see the future and most importantly, the war itself. Hunter Killers, Terminator 600's, 800's, and more. The special effects are incredible and it's fun to watch.<br/><br/>The mature themes make this movie suited to an older audience, however. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone under 14, for the language, the violence and the gore. Any Terminator fans, please check out this one! It's surely the second best of the series."

"a_shyam41","8","6","11","10 July 2009"," Salvation for The Terminator series
","I transformed into a fanatic from being just a fan of Terminator movies when I was awe-struck at the marvel of James Cameron's Terminator 2 Judgment Day as a teenager, like millions of my contemporaries to such an extent that, if I could I would name my son ""John Connor"". Thanks to this, I could bear a bloomer called Terminator 3 and it also made me hope for a much better sequel to it rather than expect a product that could meet the insurmountable high standards set by Terminator 2. Terminator Salvation has just managed to do that.<br/><br/>In the absence of Arnold, this iconic movie series needed a big star in the form of Christian Bale as John Connor. He might be slightly shadowed by Marcus's character but his performance here is far from his best, seen in ""The Dark Knight"" and ""The Machinist"". Sam Worthington as Marcus is worth watching as he mixes up his expressions seemingly well. All movies in the Terminator series draw all kinds of adjectives for its special effects and stunts and this one sure deserves some. McG (director) and the screenplay writers have unwittingly dedicated a lot of time and money for delivering ultimate action sequences and that could also be a reason for the indifference shown towards the screenplay. Moto-terminators, Harvests, Aerostats and T-800 (with Arnold's face) are certainly the highlights giving the stupendous feeling to the audience that every Terminator movie rightly deserves. There are few scenes with some of the most powerful and volatile explosions that Hollywood has ever seen, especially when the humanoid harvest fires. The background score in the movie, although good, goes unnoticed though ""Nine inch nails"" stands out in the album, which for whatever unknown reason is not utilized in the movie. In summary, this movie is colossal in production but average in writing, ultimate in action but satisfactory in momentum, relentless in explosions but short of great acting. As long as die-hard Terminator fanatics like me exist, this series is ""far from over""."
"zetes","7","6","11","31 May 2009"," The action sequences are great, even if the film isn't
","Most seem to have found this a disappointment, but personally, among the big three action flicks that have been released so far this summer (the other ones being Wolverine and Star Trek), it is the one I enjoyed most. Okay, obviously it's better than Wolverine. Anything would be. I can't really argue that Terminator Salvation is a better movie than Star Trek. It's enormously flawed in its writing, and the lead actor, Christian Bale, is every bit as terrible as Chris Pine was in Star Trek. Yeah, I hate Bale. I have since Batman Begins, and he is definitely a hindrance to my enjoyment of any movie he's in. But the highs in TS are far higher than the test-marketed-to-death Star Trek. First off, I should say that I'm a sucker for post-apocalyptic sci-fi. This film takes place in the future, after Judgement Day but before John Connor has become the great leader he is destined to become. He is now a lieutenant. After a battle, from an underground base Connor has attacked arises a disoriented man named Marcus Wright (Sam Worthington). The last thing he remembers is being executed for murder in 2003. He doesn't know why he's alive (though it's pretty obvious, especially if you've seen the commercials). Wright wanders into the destroyed city of Los Angeles and meets up with a teenage Kyle Reese (Anton Yelchin, who was also Chekov in Star Trek and will definitely be a huge star). Reese, of course, is the man Connor will send back in time to protect his mother from the terminator in the original film. He has not yet met up with Connor, who is himself looking for Kyle (remember the tape that Sarah Connor was making at the end of the first movie). That's the set-up anyway. Not that there're many surprises as the film goes on, but it's not a bad story for the most part. It does get bad in its logic, though, sometimes. The final sequences are just stupid. However, the action sequences are generally fantastic. I loved the scene with the gigantic, laser-wielding bot. This is certainly not a must-see, but it's not the embarrassment that many are making it out to be."
"mlg-t888","7","6","11","25 May 2009"," Salvation for a franchise that didn't even know it needed it
","The terminator is back again! again. As the fourth entry in the franchise this film really packs a punch with it, albeit, in a completely different ways than previous entries.<br/><br/>Whereas the first three films were small cast action films, Salvation is strictly a war movie. Aside from the same story as the it's predecessors TS shares almost no similarities to them. The largest of the differences would be the lack of Arny.<br/><br/>The lack of Governator has actually been one of the main complaints about this movie, many feel it's not the same without him.<br/><br/>Here's where I think many viewers are completely missing the point, keywords: the same. Being the same as the previous films was obviously completely beside the point, get with the program people. We had enough of Arny in T3, adding him in for a fourth time would be flogging a completely decomposed horse.<br/><br/>Actually, I felt that TS really was the saving grace for this franchise. Another movie with the same layout as the first three would simply be a drop on the ""been there, done that"" bucket. Salvation really brought a series that was dangling over the edge back to firm ground.<br/><br/>Of course, every film has it's not so great bits, this one really has all of them canned in one specific scene, the (already) infamous ""campfire scene"". For the sake of not spoiling anything I'm not going to say what happens, but as soon as you see something that remotely resembles a campfire just make a run for a bathroom break. Trust me, there's nothing there you didn't want to miss.<br/><br/>Among a few other issues is the fact that this is not the same judgment day as depicted in the first three films. Whether this is a flaw will depend on the viewers connection to the previous films in the series. <br/><br/>Whereas the opening of T2 painted a striking visual of the post-apocalyptic future, nightmarish and always battle-oriented. McG ops for a more realistic, dirty, gritty depiction of the future where it is not always nighttime and they are not consistently battling hordes of killer robots. <br/><br/>In a surprising move for McG he actually does go deeper into the ruined future-world, where the sides are not nearly as black-and-white as would be thought. For a fourth film in a series and especially for the director of ""Charlie's Angels"", ""Salvation"" actually does carry much originality and depth to it, for this I give McG credit. I personally loved the interpretation and felt it had more ground than the haunting, yet non-practical version that James Cameron dreamed up (no offense to Cameron whatsoever).<br/><br/>Unfortunately, much of the films bad press has come without a legitimate reason. Almost every detractor of this film that I have seen has essentially said ""It isn't the same as T2, this is a bad Terminator movie, it's more like Transformers"". To be honest, this is all crap. Terminator Salvation isn't a bad Terminator movie, it's simply different, and it most certainly is not like Transformers.<br/><br/>Many people don't seem to understand this however, they think ""if it's not the same, it has to be bad"". This evaluation, however, fails to state how the film is actually bad. Instead I suggest going with a basis that respects this film as it's own without outside opinion from over-zealous fans. <br/><br/>7/10 stars. If you haven't seen ""Star Trek"", watch that first, but make sure to give this a look if your a Terminator fan or not."

I mean The Dark Knight was good but not because of Christian Bale but because of Heath Ledger. <br/><br/>Heath ledger owns the Dark Knight joker character, move over Jack Nicholson. Ill be honest I laughed at Nicholson but i wouldn't play with Ledgers Joker by any means because Ledger was definitely not funny at all less he needed to be. <br/><br/>Arnold Schwarzenegger= Terminator just as Bruce Willis= John Mcclaine just as Sylvester Stallone equals Rambo just as Robert Englund= Freddy Krueger and nightmare on elm street. <br/><br/>What was the point of putting the little girl in the movie?<br/><br/>Spoilers, Spoilers, Spoilers."

","Note to self: If it's a Scifi/Action movie, and it doesn't go directly to IMAX, then it's probably crap. This movie is bad and inconsistent in so many ways that I'm not even going to go into details. I'll just say that it's as good as the Sarah Connor Chronicles, and develops the same way. And, some of the lines are corny enough to make you say 'WTF?' out loud (cuz I sure did). Our action standards have been lowered with the hype of this movie. Bale still gets a nod, because I now understand why he was melting down on the set: these people are amateurs. If you think this was an OVERALL good film, then you need to watch the first two and see what made the humans so... human. There was no emotion in this movie."
"adshekar","3","33","91","21 May 2009"," Terminator Sellout!
","It was one of the biggest disappointments in movie history. I thought the 3rd one was bad but this one was made purely for the money. The movie had everything but a story. Although the script was average, it held its own amidst all that Terminator nostalgia. Whereas the storyline was just awful. They followed a simple production formula for providing just the right amount of fun and entertainment so that most of the masses don't complain. I am a HUGE Terminator fan and to see one of the greatest movies ever made be turned into pure money-making garbage is sickening. Hollywood has had a knack of destroying potential masterpieces but this one was just a bit too much. This movie makes the 3rd one seem downright amazing. I expected a movie as memorable as the first two not a B-grade action flick complete with sentimental moments that make u groan and absolutely no climax. <br/><br/>Bottom line : Worth watching. Just don't compare it to other Terminator movies."
"Craig_McPherson","8","7","14","24 May 2009"," A feast for the senses
","Just when it seemed that the moribund Terminator franchise had wringed every last drop of blood and plot out its time-shifting story, along comes Terminator Salvation to mine the only untapped vein in the canon â€“ the backstory.<br/><br/>It's easy to be cynical about Hollywood these days, what with the penchant for remaking anything a couple of months old, so you could be forgiven for thinking that this latest installment was a mere ploy to re-boot the whole thing and kick start the cash flow once again. And it may well be that, but Terminator Salvation is much more, and surprisingly so.<br/><br/>Set in the ridiculously near year 2018, after Skynet has become sentient and blasted human civilization to smithereens, it tells the story of John Connor (Christian Bale) and his rise to the position of leader of the resistance. A destiny fueled in no small measure by a series of audio tapes bequeathed to him by his mother Sarah. It's like having your own personal set of Tony Robbins motivational tapes telling you your fate is to become humanity's last and only hope. Talk about setting the bar rather high, but when your mom has seen the future come knocking (literally) son John accepts his destiny with gusto.<br/><br/>Built into the movie's plot is Connor's quest to locate Kyle Reese (Anton Yelchin), the young fighter destined to become his father in a past time (don't you just love this?), and come to terms with the newly discovered ""infiltration unit"" named Marcus Wright (Australian Sam Worthington), a criminal sentenced to death in 2003, who signed over his body to science and a laboratory named Cyberdyne Systems.<br/><br/>This is Worthington's movie. He's far and away the best thing about Terminator Salvation, and pretty much carries the story on his back throughout. Whereas most of the cast perform admirably, I can easily think of dozens of actors who could do a serviceable job in the movie's roles, but Worthington breaths a much needed human quality into his character (as called for by the writers), and makes this Marcus Wright's story, not John Connor's.<br/><br/>Director McG (Joseph McGinty Nichol) brings a ""have no mercy"" approach to the audience, creating a sensory bombardment that is unrelenting and breathtaking. The special effects are simply spectacular, with the sole exception of a couple of the chain-gun toting toaster terminators, who are obviously men in pretty shoddy suits.<br/><br/>Would it be cynical to say we can expect more Terminator movies in the years ahead? Count on it. Not merely because Hollywood's found a new way to breath life into one of their sacred cash cows, but because there are whole new stories to be told about the war and the resistance.<br/><br/>To paraphrase Arnold, ""they'll be back""."
"krloskba","8","7","14","21 May 2009"," GREAT movie. Much better than the ""ROTTEN"" I expected
","I just saw the film at 12:55. First of all, the film is GOOD!. I was actually surprised by the quality of the film. I mean, I understand some of the ""errors"" that can be seen in the film. But they are just a little STUPID. Why? Let me begin:<br/><br/>1> there are some critics saying something like in the following lines: ""What McG forgot was that T1 and T2 began with intense battles of the future"" WHAT IS WRONG WITH THESE CRITICS! After Marcus is introduced as a prisoner waiting execution, the first thing you see is A BATTLE BETWEEN SKYNET AND THE RESISTANCE!!!!! <br/><br/>2> Some critics argue that the dialogue is bad.<br/><br/>Personally, the dialogue didn't seem bad at all. It was normal. I specially liked the part when John says ""I'll be back"" and the little "" What makes us human"" soliloquy that Marcus has at the end. By the way, the ""I'll be back"" was the only retroactive dialogue from T1 and T2.<br/><br/>3>Some say that you see Arnold only for a little time.<br/><br/>First of all, people already know that Arnold will only be seen for an instance. So this argument is just stupid.Furthermore, there are about two close ups in a lapse of about two minutes before the skin is peeled off. Moreover, what do these critics expect? They seem to expect Arnold to quit his job to come and shoot this movie. C'MON!I actually appreciate the fact that McG took the care enough to include Arnold at least for an instance in his movie. Now, I will say that the scene where you John says that Skynet is experimenting with human tissue to create the T-800 is not included.Thus, the movie is not able to explain real well how did the T-800 with the ""Arnold"" image came into existence. Arnold basically kind of pops up. Also, Bale could have improved this part by acting a little more surprised or fearful. <br/><br/>4> THE FREAKING MOVIE IS ALREADY IN THE FUTURE! IT WOULD BE STUPID TO NARRATATE THE STORY OF T1, T2,and T3 AGAIN. Moreover, the purpose of the resistance fighting is SUMMARIZED IN THE BEGINNING!. <br/><br/>5> Some say that Bale's performance was bad, almost pathetic. OK, let us review. John Connor is a leader of the Resistance. He has been fighting since 2003. The machines are becoming more powerful. WHAT DO YOU EXPECT HIM TO BE? A CLOWN? A GUY THAT JUST LAUGHS WHILE TERMINATORS ARE TRYING TO KILL HIM? As far as I know, his performance of a battle-ridden, hardcore leader is excellent.Indeed, his rebellious nature (remember T2) is seen in some instances of the film. Also, what is wrong with the Batman voice? Let me put it this way, it is Bale's voice that makes the Batman voice, not Batman's voice that makes Bale's voice! This argument is just stupid, he was just speaking normally, just a little lower to give some intensity, that is all. GOSH! <br/><br/>6>Some say that the story shows no advancement of the franchise. ARE YOU KIDDING ME? ARE YOU SERIOUS? I am sorry, I have to ask this again. ARE YOU FREAKING SERIOUS? IT SEEMS THAT YOU, CRITICS, DID NOT WATCHED THE MOVIE AND WERE SO CONCENTRATED ON WATCHING WHEN ARNOLD WOULD BE BACK THAT YOU MISSED THE WHOLE POINT. THE STORY IS ABOUT THE EMERGENCE OF THE INFILTRATOR PROGRAM!!!!! <br/><br/>7> Some cite bad directing and bad editing. Let me say that I understand what they are saying. I understand why they are saying it. I admit that there were about three times were the changes in scenes did not fit well (i.e. errors, for ex. one takes a shirt off, then has the shirt on). But I will tell you what I thing happened here: time constrain. McG said that the DVD version will have about 40 minutes of deleted scenes, INCLUDING SOME WHERE JOHN and the other characters WILL come into FOCUS. I think that the production company forced McG to decrease the length of the movie. Therefore, he was forced to omit many scenes that were the ones in between these cuts. I look forward for the DVD because I hope that McG's full version will actually prove these critics, who think that he was a bad director, wrong and shut them up.<br/><br/>Let me discuss the last statement above. McG has potential. This movie proves it. I will tell you some of the reasons. If you remember Star Trek because of the laughs, you will remember TS because of the feel of reality and peril that it transmits. (let me mention that Star Trek was good, but not that remarkable. I would give it about 3/4 stars. Also, Kirk and Spock did not seemed to be really in harm's way during the last scenes. I mean, you would expect the enormous Romulan ship like that one shown to be packed with people as in the Enterprise. Of course, there were an immense number of hallways, but only one or two people trying to kill Kirk or Spock. Also, how can such an advanced ship only shoot six missiles? Come on!)Let me continue by saying that there are many instances were McG pays tribute to the T1 and T2 and he does it really well. The action scenes are awesome and the story is well explained, explained well enough that you are able to understand the PURPOSE OF MARCUS.<br/><br/>This movie is Definitely UNDERRATED. IT IS GOOD AND I RECOMMEND IT. WATCH IT.<br/><br/>Conclusion: If you don't like it, that is fine. I though it was good. Definitely BETTER THAN T3. I look forward for T5.<br/><br/>Overall rate: 3/4 stars Comments: Room for improvement. Should have included scene where John explains the existence of the T-800. More focus on the other characters too. Good overall."
"kilo43","2","11","25","22 June 2009"," terribly disappointing (but you kinda knew it would be)
","OK. First off, I AM A HUGE TERMINATOR FAN, y'know? the sort of tedious person who says all the lines out loud until people get annoyed, lol Therefore I will always try to side with anything 'Terminator' BUT.... This was utter tripe.<br/><br/>A story would help, but then story lines don't seem required by 90% of US movies nowadays as the industry has destroyed all it's potential paying consumer base over recent years in it's continual marketing-stats driven blunder towards a cinema/DVD userbase of almost exlusively American teenagers... and lets face it, anything that requires even 1 braincell is overload for them, so the ideal seems to be: keep it as stupid as possible.<br/><br/>Bale is just terrible in this, like you know he hates the film and isn't even trying to disguise his utter contempt and detatchment from the job in hand. In all truth, no amount of acting skills could have salvaged this.<br/><br/>The worst thing was that in all the previous Terminator films, the 'resistance' stay inside by day, venturing out only at night to take on the machines with basic weapons as any true 'resistance' would do. In this film the 'resistance' has huge bases with massive arcraft hangers and gigantic hi-end tech control centers etc. Yeah right! about as ludicrous as making a ww2 'French Resistance' film where the resistance have huge airfields and bases that mysteriously the Germans can't detect or find... BUT This is a war against machines; machines which can sniff out even a lone individuals in a desert hiding under a rock, yet somehow 'The Machines' cant detect and find the resistance's massive infastructure? Oh come On! <br/><br/>In summary, to make a movie likethis you simply ask CGI guys to design, build and render a bunch of action scenes; drop them all in a hat, pull them out at random and then cobble them together with any nonsense that vaguely glues them together in a linear sequence.<br/><br/>Glad I saw it, but in a word: tosh probably it's one of those films you dislike in the cinema but then find a lot better watching at home on DVD when you aren't putting so much expectation onto the thing."
"chrisclowes1","6","11","25","24 May 2009"," I found it OK, not much story line, but my kids enjoyed it
","Just been to see this movie this evening. While the special effects and action are as stunning as ever, the story line seems weak to non-existent in this flick. The production is well managed but the screenplay is simply very lacking. If you're looking for a replay of action demonstrated in the first few movies then you will not be too disappointed, but if you are hoping to see any kind of real plot to go along with it then you will probably left wondering whether the movie really made any statements at all. To me it seemed like a predicable set play with no real build up in the storyline. Still my kids enjoyed it at 13 and almost 12, so if that's anything to go by then maybe it's really aimed at their age group rather than attempting to address the wishes of a more adult viewer who may perhaps have expected more? Not a complete waste of 2 hours, but I doubt I'll remember the experience much after the end of today. My thirteen year old son was the reason we went to see this movie and even he was questioning the plot as we were driving back home. I would class this as a mediocre Hollywood presentation at best..."
"Jackpollins","7","5","9","13 August 2009"," Come on, people, this is a decent action film, not great, but decent
","The new action-thriller, Terminator Salvation is not great, but if it proves one thing: an action film can be mindless and moodless and still be good. Terminator 3 was terrible, yet a lot of people still liked it. Terminator Salvation is good, but people seem to hate it. This is a sign that more and more people these days have to see sophisticated films in the theater, even if it means seeing mostly bad films. Yes, there are a lot of good sophisticated films, but when something as brainless and moodless as this comes around, I'm still able to enjoy it. This movie nicely follows two stories mashed into one: John Connor (Christian Bale) waking up and discovering a whole new world, and then meeting Kyle Reese (Anton Yelchin), and Marcus Wright (Sam Worthington) fighting war on the other side of the new world. I respect, and quite like what they're trying to do here: telling us what we might of missed in the other Terminator movies. The film is nothing new or special, but just a good old recommendable fun time at the movies. PS, anyone looking forward to the Arnold Schwarzenegger cameo will not be let down."
"buckingham_2","4","5","9","24 July 2009"," what a let down
","It would be fair to say that this is one of the most eagerly awaited films this year right, well unfortunately your about to be disappointed! The plot from start to finish is full of holes, whole armies of terminators walking around the battle field, yet only one to guard skynet ? yea right The action is A team like, little blood or violence, the terminator who donates his heart at the end for john Connor is as corny as it comes, I mean come on could see this coming a mile off, and for what reason cant some no body from the resistance donate a heart back to the terminator ? I mean he is worth 1000 of them? That is of course if they are the correct blood type.. .<br/><br/>You wouldn't put your 8 year old son in front of Terminator one or 2 would you? Yet Terminator Salvation is laughable, The X-men has more action and violence in it for god sake. The effects some might say are good, however that's only to be expected in today's movie world.<br/><br/>To be honest my wife could have written and produced a far better version of this film, bring back the blood, violence, and the fear these machines are suppose to make us feel, without that the film doesn't warrant a Terminator title!

The only good thing about investing my time going to a cinema to watch this crap was the good bucket of popcorn. If, as it's obvious, the intention of this ""movie"" was to catch more audience for the next sequels, you miserably failed. Get a good screenwriter, a decent director and get rid of those producers. Maybe, just maybe, I'll watch the next one. Most probably renting it on DVD. A complete failure. Next time save your over 100 mill in FX and invest them in getting a good story to tell.

"stormtrooper2004","7","5","9","23 June 2009"," good start to a new 3 part film series.....has potential....need Chris Nolan or a talented director to replace MC G
","I went to watch this in cinema the other night, its been out two or 3 weeks. So I've read and heard all of the hype about the story.<br/><br/>Firstly the positives should be the ever so consistent Christian bale, who once again is the pick of the cast, Moon Bloodgood, and the other female in this were impressive. Although Anton Yelchin as Kyle Reese does steal the show, also Marcus rights character and the way he s portrayed soon becomes a positive in the film. Overall the casting was top notch without getting too many stars.<br/><br/>The other positives were let down by a poor publicity attempt by releasing the few good parts and twists that were in the script. Such things as telling us Arnold Schwarzenegger is in it, although only a CGI. Also releasing that th main cyborg, Marcus right, has a human heart, and is in fact half human half machine, when if they had kept that quiet, it could of become a massive although guessable twist in the script. This is also shows MC G either didn't care too much about the film, or just was poor in the ironing out of the script as he left many loopholes. For example in T3 Schwarzenegger says he terminated John Connor, in this he almost does, but doesn't succeed, so unless he adds this into the other films, which i doubt as he wont want to keep putting a CGI Schwarzenegger, then bale wasn't killed by him. This is OK because Connor says its a different future, but then MC G used a lot of history form the others, such as kyle Reese being Connor's dad, and the photograph, this is OK also, but MC G should of chose to base it on the whole history, or non at all, leaving many loopholes because he doesn't decide. <br/><br/>One huge loophole is that john Connor says he and Marcus wright (the cyborg) have been fighting for centuries, but there was never any mention of him in the other 3 films, and Connor doesn't know about him until now, So they haven't been fighting for years. Unless he means hypothetically as a machine, but then surely the machine would know? its just a bit unclear, something MC G should of ironed it again at the script phase, before making bale put a performance on a half completed story, and characters.<br/><br/>The negatives are simple, the direction. all decisions a director makes have big impacts, and although I believe MC G will become a talented director, I think the amount of potential and the scale of a terminator film is too big for his abilities, he still hasn't learnt his own directing strengths and weaknesses, he isn't ready for film this big. Because of that he uses way too many explosions, and action that completely overshadows the storyline, a storyline that wasn't overall too bad if plots had been kept quiet and filmed appropriately, for example, there's a scene where Christian Bale gets emotional trying to appeal to human emotions, and the scene gets you caring,....for 3 seconds then its over, it should of been dragged out, and really got you into the film before the final battle. Even the moments of cheese, such as where bale says ""il be back"" are done very tastefully, this particular one should be credited to Jonothan Nolan who helped write the dark knight with his very talented brother Christopher Nolan.<br/><br/>This poor direction to release too much and cut out too much story and replace it with action leaves you with still a good film, as the acting and script are pretty good. Just the directors choices and techniques lowered its overall rating.<br/><br/>Its understandable to see why Christian bale did his rant, after caring about a script and doing so well in his own performance, and being let down by the director and some dodgy lighting ;)<br/><br/>4 the next one i suggest any talented story director, Michael bay and jerry bruckheimer maybe? or the ever growing Chris Nolan"
"The_Void","6","5","9","11 June 2009"," Good guys in a truck, baddies on motorbikes...it's all gone wrong.
","The short scenes showcasing the 'future' in the first two Terminator films were some of the most captivating of the series. While I personally thought that what we saw in the first two films was enough to set the scene for those two movies and I never really wanted to see any more of the future world; it's clear that there is enough opportunity for a movie there, and it was inevitable that we'd get a Terminator movie set in the future eventually. It would have been nice if it were a better than this one, however. The film begins in 2003 and we see a man executed, before donating his body to some kind of cybernetic research project. The film then fast forwards to 2018, and the main plot, of course, focuses on John Connor; a soldier that has grown up to fulfil the destiny prophesised in the earlier films. Connor has discovered that Skynet are working on a new Terminator model, the T-800; just around the same time that the executed prisoner from 2003 has woken up in the future. The resistance has discovered an 'off switch' for Skynet's systems and hopes to win the war with it; but soon after Connor learns that his father, Kyle Reese, is number one on Skynet's most wanted list and sets out to find him.<br/><br/>The plot sounds complicated but it really isn't; very little thought went into the storyline and it's clear that director ""McG"" felt he could wing it on action scenes alone. The most disappointing thing in this respect is the character of John Connor. They went to the trouble of hiring one of the best movie stars of the moment in Christian Bale; and then completely wasted him by making his character an absolute non-entity. We learn barely anything about him other than the fact that he doesn't like the machines; but he just comes across as a paranoid technophobe. This is even more unbelievable considering that we're supposed to believe this is the same character that cried at the end of Terminator 2 when Arnie descended into the melting pot. The only character that really provides any interest is Marcus Wright; the convict killed at the start of the film and later resurrected. His story is much more interesting and I think he even has more screen time than Christian Bale; making me think that producers were just scared to have an unknown actor at the top of the bill. Which is a shame because Sam Worthington is the only person involved in this film to come out with any credit.<br/><br/>The disappointment of the characters is matched by the incompetent writing with regards to the story. The plot features a great many coincidences and much of it doesn't make sense. There's no real imagination on display either and the film really fails to inspire the viewer. Thankfully, the saving grace comes in the form of the action sequences - which are loud, brash and well orchestrated. There are plenty of them too, which helps to ensure that the film is at least mostly entertaining. Of course, the special effects are impressive...but I can't say too much about that since good effects are simply the norm for big budget action films these days. The actor they brought in to play Kyle Reese is a bit of a disappointment. Of course, the character is much younger than he was in The Terminator; but are we really supposed to believe that weedy Anton Yelchin would grow up to be Michael Biehn? It also has to be said that the vision of the future presented in this film is far too clean and not enough like the hopeless and dirty scenes shown in the original Terminator films. There are a few nods to the older and superior movies in the form of quotes and music; but it really just feels like a young kid mimicking his big brother. All the disappointment is eventually capped off by the ending...which is just mind-bogglingly stupid. Overall, this film is a very disappointing mess. An entertaining mess for sure...but the Terminator series ended in 1991 for me."

","McG and team have managed to rejuvenate my interest in the Terminator series, well done, a great movie. I just hope that you have kept enough back for the next two movies! I had some reservations about this movie after seeing the initial IMDb ratings and director McG's efforts on Charlie's Angels, admittedly an altogether different movie, but it left me with the impression McG was a bit of a goofy idiot. Maybe he just got caught up in a moment of goofy bliss while working with Cameron & Drew.<br/><br/>I've heard that some people can't get into this movie, and maybe the difference in opinion is somehow linked to ties with the first three movies. Some may have only seen the third (poor) movie and the TV series (good 1st season) which wouldn't really help you here. It's not essential, but it would help to see the 1st and 2nd movies so you can appreciate the threads McG has wound into this movie.<br/><br/>Knowing that Christian Bale was in the lead role certainly helped maintain my interest, serious actors help bring weight to a movie, and I have to say Sam Worthington was excellent too, he was the perfect match for Bale, and I'm sure he's going to be big in years to come.<br/><br/>I'm very happy I went along to see it now, and afterword's I even felt that movie buzz that I haven't had since Dark Knight. 8/10."

","This goes closer to the original Terminator than any of the others do which is only a good thing. It has a kind of darker Mad Max feel to it by showing how pockets of people around the world survived judgement day and are now facing the struggle of survival against nature and most importantly SkyNet.<br/><br/>The contemporary sharp cinematography is in the direction of Transformers and War of The Worlds with a bit of matrix in there for boot. Christian Bale brings a lot of credibility to the role of John Conner but surprisingly isn't the main focal point of the film. I would've liked to have seen him more in it. The rest of casting was pretty good with some good performances.<br/><br/>It contains a lot of nods to the other Terminator films (except perhaps T3 but the less said about that the better), but keeps it's own individual identity as a brilliant Action Film following in great footsteps.

"theeintolerablekidd","7","5","9","9 June 2009"," Low expectations = a better film
","I can't believe the press about this film, it's really not that bad at all. Obviously it's not going to be as good as the first two films - they were two of the most spectacular and best sci-fi/action movies of all time - but by the time you get to the forth film in a franchise what do you expect? One thing all the bad press has done is lowered our expectations so much this actually comes out as a good movie. I guess it's to do with all the hype surrounding the making of it. People have been really hard on Christian Bale and he really isn't that bad at all here, and like another reviewer said; his on-set out burst is understandable when you see the character he was playing. <br/><br/>It's a dirty gritty film. It tries to give us what Terminator 2 only showed us for a few seconds - the war between humans and the machines they created - and it does an okay job. Personally I think it could have been a bit darker but it wasn't at all bad and certainly a lot better than the comicesque sunshine of Terminator 3 (this film should have been T3). It gives us a wide variety of terminators and even a digitalised Arnie that was so life-like I had to check the cast listing - small terminators, huge Titan like terminators, flying terminator aeroplanes, motorbike terminators, terminators with massive chins, and even terminator fish!! The only thing this film doesn't give us, which is what I personally wanted to see, was thousands of terminators all together marching en masse.<br/><br/>Yeah the plot-line has holes. It had me pondering on the point of it for a while (what so J Conner has to save Reese who has to go back in time to save J Conner who when he grows up has to save Reese who has to go back in time to... so what would happen if we just removed these two people... ahh... OK I understand...) but f**k it... it's an action film, and it's good solid science fiction.<br/><br/>Surely the best film by a pretentious and ridiculously named director ever.. I just hope he either stops making films after this or starts using a proper name... Thanks."
"msirivia-1","10","5","9","8 June 2009"," The critics got it wrong again
","This movie is about our kind trying to recover their lost humanity fighting this hopeless war for so many years. The atmosphere is very bleak, there is very limited hope. Even Connor is not an inspiring leader, not to mention the fact that Connor is not even the leader, which is a new, not bad at all element. <br/><br/>Most likely the Command are left over submarine commanders who were in much better shape to lead the resistance due to the armament and their stealth capability. Of course Connor has street cred but he has not mastered the soul of the resistance yet.<br/><br/>He is not sure, neither anybody is, why it is worth fighting this war. What makes us better than those machines. He just knows that we have to fight, but not really why. Then comes the _real_ protagonist. He is a criminal with a chip in the head. but somehow due to a glitch in his ... design, his humanity prevails. Skynet does not expect it: why would a perfect machine chose the imperfection of the human spirit over the perfection of being the ultimate infiltrating machine?<br/><br/>And right there Connor learns his most important lesson, that what makes us human is sacrifice and doing what's moral, not what appears optimal. That's humanity's Salvation.<br/><br/>McG totally rebooted the series and he gave it an unexpected spin. The whole wooden acting, the lack of emotion, lack of connectedness is on purpose. These are people that have been deprived of their humanity, their emotion. They have falsely learned that they have to be more like the machines in order to defeat them. <br/><br/>Yes the editing sucked, but I am sure McG will be exonerated in the director's cut version.<br/><br/>The critics got it totally wrong and this won't be the first time, see for example ""Starship Troopers"" ..."

","I for one, was absolutely appalled by this movie - the sheer and utter audacity of the writers/director to create such a piece of crap is just wrong. Not just to any original fan of the terminator, but to any film fan in general. First Christian bale - the so-called ""master of accents"" as he is formerly known, should be shunned from any reprisal of the role and from any other future film roles. Not at all a far-cry from what he did in batman (Put on a voice that no-one can understand and shout and scream) i found myself trying to hard to hear what he was saying rather than the plot of the film - to be honest i don't know which was worse. The story however had a OKish plot, even though there were more plot holes than i care to remember. The biggest thing that stood out was the the way the film could have been so amazing but ended up making rise of the machines look more than half decent. Overall i am extremely disappointed, for entertainment purposes its watchable. But if you are a fan who have waited for this since rise of the machines then for your sakes and all the memories you have of the terminator, go and see mean girls instead. Thank you for ruining my childhood Mcginty and hopefully you wont be back."

","This movie has a lot of good points, especially in comparison to Rise of the Machines, but it has some major faults as well.<br/><br/>***SPOILERS***SPOILERS***SPOILERS***SPOILERS***<br/><br/>YOU WERE WARNED<br/><br/>The story is a bit ""all over the place"" not really drawing into any characters struggle. You do sorta get to see Marcus Wright but even that seems overcomplicated.<br/><br/>The machines were unrealistic, going for horrific designs that, most of the time, seemed too well thought out. The original terminator was minimal. Even Arnie looked completely different to the original design. And, of course, there's the 50 foot terminators. Despite their size, they're still able to sneak up on a gas station in the middle of the desert.<br/><br/>Skynets idiocy even allows Wright the ability to shut down all its defenses so that John Connor can be ripped apart by a single robot. Given the fact that it apparently knows about Kyle Reece, and that 3, count'em THREE separate Terminators, two far more advance than Skynet can dream of, were unable to get Connors, why the hell would it think that this one could do it.<br/><br/>I'm after upsetting myself a small bit thinking of what's wrong with the movie... I do focus on the negative when I think of movies. This movie is worth going to see in the cinema. My expectations were low before I went in and I was impressed in parts. I wouldn't expect the magic of T1 and T2 though."

"charlytully","7","5","9","2 June 2009"," Don't try to figure out the rules for this alternate reality
","For special effects fans, this edition of TERMINATOR looks pretty cool on a big screen. For action movie buffs, there certainly is enough killing, sneaking around, and being chased to satisfy all but the shortest attention spans. However, for devotees of serious science fiction, SALVATION is no BLADE RUNNER. In this latest franchise offering, the machines seem pretty dominant (just as the zombies had become by the time DAY OF THE DEAD was released in that franchise). The only explanation offered as to why some of the few remaining humans are imprisoned rather than being killed instantly is that these captives are needed by the machines to better engineers their genocidal final-solution mechanisms. Meanwhile, wildlife is even scarcer in this alternate reality than surviving humans, indicating the machines have no interest in preserving bioforms on planet Earth. Given that attitude, what keeps the machines from using one of the 93+ readily available environmental contaminants capable of quickly wiping out life on earth without damaging any of their own components? To them, this should be just as much of a no-brainer as one of us using Weed-Be-Gone in our front yard. If the machines aren't smart enough to come up with such a simple tactic on their own, it is totally implausible that they've had as much success against humans as this movie series suggests.<br/><br/>Where would I like the TERMINATOR series to go? Well, PLANET OF THE APES would be a neat concept, were it not for all of the people running around in tacky ape suits. One movie that successfully (if briefly) portrayed dominated humans was SLAUGHTERHOUSE FIVE, in which Billy Pilgrim spends part of his time in a zoo cage for the amusement of his alien captors. FIDO had the novel idea of presenting collar-controlled zombies as robotic conveniences for the triumphant human race. Why can't someone make a movie in which the zombies curb their appetites, and enslave the surviving humans, or a TERMINATOR movie in which the machines control humans for their own benefit, instead of mindlessly slaughtering them?"
"SophomoreSlump","8","5","9","1 June 2009"," Epic visual cinematography, but the rest falls apart.
","Let's keep it simple: For fans of Terminator, you might find it disappointing. But for the rest, this movie is the one to watch.<br/><br/>The movie focuses on Marcus Wright (Sam Worthington), a death row inmate, who is convinced by Dr. Kogan (Helena Carter) to donate his body for an experiment, and then finds himself in a devastated future. He then comes across a teenager Kyle Reese (Anton Yelchin) and a little girl named Star (Jadagrace). The three of them avoid danger and certain death on a journey to find the future leader of the Resistance to the machines, the legendary character we all know from the past Terminator movies, John Connor (Christian Bale). John Connor, with the help of his wife Kate (Bryce Howard), on the other hand, is busy trying to stop Skynet with a new found sound wave that could ""off"" machines and also trying to convince the command of the Resistance not to bomb Skynet because there are still human prisoners there.<br/><br/>The storyline sounds interesting enough, yet there is no depth to it. It's the total opposite of what the first two movies were all about. There are little development for the characters and the ending seems rushed. The first half of the movie is very promising, but the rest just says ""Hollywood"".<br/><br/>The acting is a very good aspect of the movie though. Sam Worthington stole the spotlight from the rest. Seeming as an unknown actor, he works well being a confused person who was reborn into the future. We could feel his pain and suffering in some scenes. And with James Cameron's Avatar coming up, I see a bright future for Worthington. The rest of the cast were just good enough. Anton Yelchin has convincingly played a young Kyle Reese. He had probably watched and rewatched The Terminator (1984). Christian Bale really needs to drink some water and put off his Batman voice, while Helena Bonham Carter and Bryce Howard did not get enough screen time.<br/><br/>What really saves this movie is the visual aspect. The CGI effect is marvellous and epic. We get to see a post-apocalyptic world, with a tone down colour that really gives a sombre atmosphere. And then the jets, weaponry and the submarine of the Resistance. And, of course, the terminators look so realistic. The action sequences were way above any summer movies this year.<br/><br/>To conclude, if you're a die-hard Terminator fan, stay away from this movie – far away! – or give it a chance. But if you're just a casual fan and wants to know what happens next, or an action movie fan, or just a casual movie-goer out for a bit of summer action fun, then Terminator Salvation is perfect for you."
"dee.reid","9","5","9","25 May 2009"," Dark ""Salvation,"" bright future
","""Terminator Salvation"" is nowhere near the disaster it could have been, and I say that as a hardcore fan of the ""Terminator"" franchise. I had never seen the two ""Charlie's Angels"" movies that ""Terminator Salvation"" director McG was behind, but I was aware of his history as a music video director and the trouble that could rain down upon ""Terminator Salvation.""<br/><br/>The verdict is that McG pulls through, even though his music video sensibilities worked their way into the film's numerous action sequences. That also being said, this movie is very well-made and looks fantastic. While this is certainly a ""Terminator"" for the MTV generation (fans of the movies made in the '80s and '90s may suffer some vertigo while watching this), McG's faults don't really show that much, even while his movie is a crystal-clear example of how low Hollywood's standards have fallen in recent years.<br/><br/>I'm not bashing ""Terminator Salvation""; I'm simply proving a point about how well-made it is, considering the fact that any movie that is well-made nowadays can still be complete crap. And the movie is also well-acted and damn thrilling. Lastly, it's also pretty smart (with the way it handles the various time travel paradoxes present in the series, that make the impossible seem possible with enough thought). McG has also played down the significance of conversations he had with ""The Terminator"" (1984) co-writer and director James Cameron, in which it was widely rumored that Cameron had given the film his blessing, and that turned out not to be true. The real truth is, Cameron has never seen the movie, so he can't comment on it.<br/><br/>""The Terminator"" is my favorite sci-fi movie of all time. While ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day"" (1991) was a vastly superior sequel, I personally felt that it repeated many of the plot devices from the first movie, and the injection of light-hearted humor tended to take away from the sense of urgency pervading the movie. ""Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines"" (2003) was good, but in a brain-dead way that while it continued the story, it was just a big dumb movie with little redeeming value.<br/><br/>""Terminator Salvation"" returns some of the darkness and grit from the first ""Terminator"" and gives it a big, 2009 MTV gloss-over. While I am certain that a director's cut is on the way that will give some sense of continuity to the series (all the previous movies were rated ""R,"" while this one is ""PG-13""), I think that any restored footage will give this picture even more darkness and grit, that will further give it a sense of continuity in the greatest sci-fi series I've ever come across.<br/><br/>This film is set in 2018 (11 years before the future that we knew in the first movie), 15 years after killer machines controlled by Skynet, a rogue computer system, will wage a war to exterminate mankind. It sent human-looking cyborgs, called Terminators, back in time to eliminate the future leader of the human resistance against them, John Connor. First they tried to kill his mother Sarah Connor, and then him as a child and teenager. Now, John Connor (Christian Bale, still doing his one-note Bruce Wayne/Batman thing) is a low-ranking member of the TechCom resistance, serving under the gung-ho General Ashdown (Michael Ironside).<br/><br/>Elsewhere, Marcus Wright (Sam Worthington) awakes in a Skynet computer outpost and somehow or another crosses paths with John Connor later in the movie. Connor, meanwhile, is leading a search to locate Kyle Reese (Anton Yelchin), the teenager who will eventually become his best friend and - get ready for it - his father; only through those time travel paradoxes is this possible - see ""T1"" for reference. Marcus Wright is a peculiar specimen: the last thing he remembers is that he was on death row in the year 2003 awaiting execution when he was approached by a cancer-stricken Dr. Kogan (Helena Bonham Carter), who wanted his body donated to science. Needless to say, Wright meets Reese first, leading to events that are already well-known to fans of the series everywhere.<br/><br/>This is the first movie I've seen this year that I've felt my money was well-spent. I really liked ""Star Trek,"" but I thought it was instantly forgettable. ""Terminator Salvation"" is memorable, but I don't think it will be memorable in the same way the first movie was. This is a great, great movie; if a director's cut ever comes out, it will be even better. The great thing I always loved about the ""Terminator"" series was its anti-Cold War subtext and commentary on a society that is rapidly becoming more and more mechanical at an alarming rate. Conspiracy nuts fearful about a cybernetic revolution should look no further than the ""Terminator"" series.<br/><br/>Like most people have said, the best thing about ""Terminator Salvation"" is Sam Worthington as Marcus Wright; sadly, Bale's one-note performance makes the most important character in the movie the least interesting character. His performance is great because rather than him becoming an object of fear and horror, he's an object of sympathy. (You'll see halfway through the movie, if the previews haven't already given away his big secret.) The other revelation is Anton Yelchin as Kyle Reese; this is the first time Reese has appeared in a movie since ""T2"" (the extended version, at least). Reese has always been my favorite character, so it was nice to see someone else besides Michael Biehn play the role; Biehn's role was successfully passed to young Yelchin.<br/><br/>""Terminator Salvation"" proved to be the ""salvation"" of a series some had thought was done for good, even after ""T3"" was not so good. It's not a classic, but it is a worthy entry into this great, great sci-fi series that I love so dearly.<br/><br/>P.S.: Look out for an artificial ""cameo"" by the original Terminator himself, Arnold Schwarzenegger, with Scharzengger's face digitally added onto the body of Roland Kickinger.<br/><br/>9/10"
"jon.h.ochiai","9","5","9","25 May 2009"," A Second Chance
","In ""Terminator Salvation"" with his very existence in jeopardy and the entire Human Resistance threatened, powerful and impassioned Christian Bale as leader John Connor declares, ""If we stay the course, we are dead. We are all dead!"" Christian Bale is such an intense and explosive presence. He has also been publicized for his personal explosion on the set of ""Terminator Salvation"". Perhaps, this was warranted or not? Bale has since apologized for his lapse in judgment and manners. Bale's passion and intensity elevates Director McG's ""Terminator Salvation"". Up until now, McG's most noteworthy movies were ""Charlie's Angels"" and ""Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle"". Being a ""Terminator"" fan and a huge fan of the first two movies by James Cameron, hearing about ""Terminator Salvation"" seemed bit of a crap shoot. McG does well. The director pays homage to the mythology, and creates a new one particularly in the character of Marcus Wright, brilliantly played by charismatic Sam Worthington. The story by John Brancato, Michael Ferris, and Jonathan Nolan (""The Dark Knight"") is action driven and compelling pathos.<br/><br/>""Terminator Salvation"" works, because Worthington matches Bale's intensity and power. Their styles compliment. Especially from the ""Batman"" movies, Bale embodies a fierce internal drive and intelligence. He also balances a sense of compassion in Resistance Leader John Connor. Worthington as Marcus Wright, who may be the demise of Bale's Connor or as he says, ""I'm the only hope you have"" is tortured and courageous resolve. Worthington balances strength and vulnerability. At the story arc, John (Bale) asks Marcus (Worthington), ""You think you're human?"" Marcus tells Resistance fighter (beautiful and strong Moon Bloodgood), ""Everyone deserves a second chance"" This spirit echoes throughout ""Terminator Salvation"". That spirit lightens McG's very dark and violent vision of this Post Apocalyptic world.<br/><br/>The Terminator machines in the movie are amazing, and the action sequences are pulse pounding thrill rides. There is a spectacular scene where a Skynet drone demolishes a bridge during a high speed chase. And in the climax, the battle with Bale, Worthington, and the ""old school"" Terminator is very cool.<br/><br/>We first meet Marcus Wright in 2003, prior to his execution. He literally signs his life away to dying Dr. Kogan (frighteningly frail Helena Bonham Carter), who works for Cyberdyne Systems. In the Terminator mythology, Cyberdyne designed Skynet as the ultimate autonomous defense system. However, when Skynet is deployed the system becomes sentient and causes the nuclear holocaust, Judgment Day.<br/><br/>Now 2018, Kyle Reese (spirited Anton Yelchin) rescues wondering Marcus from Terminator attack in the Los Angeles wasteland. He says, ""Come with me, if you want to live!"" There are pockets of Resistance scattered throughout the remainder of the world. Kyle Reese, though a teenager, will become the father of John Connor (Bale)—part of the narrative paradox. Marcus and John are destined to meet. But are they defining heroes, or tragic rivals in the ultimate conflict? Bale and Worthington are awesome in this matching of wills and humanity. The supporting cast is strong for the most part. Moon Bloodgood is great as Marcus's friend Blair Williams. Anton Yelchin has that youthful zeal as Kyle Reese. Bryce Dallas Howard seems miscast as John's pregnant and loving wife Kate. She does not provide the movie's emotional anchor.<br/><br/>In the end, ""Terminator Salvation"" is worth watching, because of the great hero story and the powerful performances by Bale and Worthington. The shining objects are the metallic machines and rumbling explosions, but what compels is the human story from the hearts of Bale and Worthington."
"moviewizguy","8","5","9","24 May 2009"," The End Begins
","Set in post-apocalyptic 2018, John Connor is the man fated to lead the human resistance against Skynet and its army of Terminators. But the future Connor was raised to believe in is altered in part by the appearance of Marcus Wright, a stranger whose last memory is of being on death row. As Skynet prepares its final onslaught, Connor and Marcus both embark on an odyssey that takes them into the heart of Skynet's operations, where they uncover the terrible secret behind the possible annihilation of mankind.<br/><br/>Let me start off to say that each Terminator film is different from one another. The first was a sci-fi. horror, I guess you may call it. The second and third, both very similar to each other, were sci-fi. action movies, opening to the summer audiences. Now, this, this is different. I don't know how to explain it. It's more depressing and gritty than the previous three films, having less jokes and comedic relief than ever, which is kind of encouraging and unfortunate, I suppose. The tone is very different, which is quite great, because I love to see different things from sequels by different directors, this, here, being McG.<br/><br/>In fact, from the opening sequence, you can tell the movie will be in a different vain. You can start with the score by Danny Elfman. In this film, I don't remember hearing the main theme for the Terminator films. As a person who never really thought the Terminator theme was that great in the first place, I'm grateful to say that I just fell in love with Elfman's new theme, bringing in freshness to the franchise, as well as hinting the original theme. I might be in the minority, but I don't care. The score was fantastic.<br/><br/>What I also like about this is how everything fits together. This is the film where we meet a much younger Kyle Reese, John Conner's father, before he was sent back in time where we finally meet him in the first Terminator film. With that being said, this film didn't really add anything to the story. In other words, we could have gone without this film. However, I don't think this is necessarily a bad thing. I look at it that this film is just a set up to what will happen in the next sequel.<br/><br/>Now comes the kicker: McG. As a director, I appreciated his previous works, including the pilot episode of the TV show, ""Chuck,"" along with the entertaining Charlie's Angels films. I love his energetic feel whenever he directs something. Without a doubt, this guy has a good eye. Technically, the film is stunning. He said before that he wanted to take long shots, and boy, did those scenes stick out in the film. There is one early on the movie that has John Conner coming out of a base, getting into a helicopter, having it hit by a Terminator machine, having the helicopter fall down, having Conner crawl out of the helicopter, and having Conner look up at a huge mushroom cloud hundreds of feet away. Now that's just one. I think these shots are an amazing technical feat.<br/><br/>Christian Bale comes into the franchise as the new John Conner. Although he doesn't have that much of a screen time, he did well, honestly. Sam Worthington was suggested by James Cameron for McG to be in the film. In fact, Cameron praised Worthington so much that Worthington became an overnight star. In this film, though, I thought he was decent. He is not really as good as people make him out to be. Anton Yelchin had appeared in ""Star Trek"" a couple of weeks ago. In here, he does no less of a fantastic job, playing the young Kyle Reese. He's a great, young actor.<br/><br/>Bryce Dallas Howard replaced Claire Danes as John Conner's wife, Kate. I really thought she pulled off well in here, with the limited screen time she appears in here, as well. Moon Bloodgood is the last actor worth mentioning in this film. She does a great job as Worthington's love interest. One last actor I would like to name here is Jadagrace Berry, who plays a mute kid. She put in some heart and soul into this film. I appreciated that. With these actors named, I felt that this was a great ensemble picture.<br/><br/>I think the look and feel of the film is incredible. Well, with a budget of $200 million, it better be. The post-apocalyptic look was vast and gloomy. The CGI was flawless, I think. There were some unbelievable action sequences as well. I won't name them here to ruin the surprise but some of them are jaw dropping. As a big summer blockbuster, I think this film is great. I mean, if you're going in to see this film, you better see it as a big summer blockbuster that offers the most explosions I've ever seen on one film, some great action sequences, and some great imagination in work. It's a fun, entertaining movie and the running time shouldn't be longer than it really is now. I can't compare it to the other Terminator films but, if I must, this is as good as Terminator 3 (yes, I liked that movie) and better than the first."

","Being a big fan of the ""Terminator"" series, I have been salivating over this movie for about a year but I must say something was missing from it. I always thought it was great in the first and second movies when they flashed forward but for me it turns out that this future is just too bleak and uninteresting. My main problem with this movie is that it just wasn't that much fun to watch. Of course the action sequences are great but it is just not nearly as compelling as the first 2 movies. I can't really put my finger on it but I just felt flat and disappointed when I left the theater. While Bale is solid and believable as John Connor, this movie could not get me to care about the rest of the cast. For me this series just works better with the Time travel dynamic and the more they tinker with it (after the 2nd movie and T.V. show) it is becoming almost a parody of itself. I know they are going to make more of these because they will probably always make money but they should really quit while they are ahead."

The CGI action scenes look cheesy and seem to remind you of every action film ever made since the miserable Matrix.

","I've heard these names so much i 've seen so many stories about these two that i wish they were never created. It's because most stories were bad to the point of "" ..***k this, i'm out!"". I could never love ""the good guys"" too much: spoiled geniuses, holding the faith of the Universe in their hands. That's why i could never love Superman or Jesus. Do you get what i'm saying? You must be such a narrow minded slave to believe such things. (And if you are, well..you're not alone. billions are just like you.) This i consider to be the main flaw of these Terminator stories. <br/><br/>But note that in the first one the legend was in the making, the good people were just people, like us, only chased by machines. And that was the one great story needed to be told! The second one got stupid. And cheesy. For the sake of cool scenes, the logic took a dive. While T1000 had to stop to ""heal"", the old model would still walk. Why? heal what, its human shape? ..well, whatever..it was still way better than what was to come: the third, the series and this one here. Disastrous.<br/><br/>It's eerie how this movie doesn't follow closely any of the characters' emotions, state of mind, purpose, motivations, egos, interactions, decisions, conflicts, etc. It makes you uninterested in their faith. And then you don't like 'em, so automatically you don't care about the story, and finally you're annoyed by all that noise, yelling and ""action""! - this is what happens. TS is the perfect example on how to fail at a movie. <br/><br/>By the way there is no story, and what is presented to you doesn't make much sense. You might not care, you might think..well, i may still enjoy it. But think a bit harder: isn't it precisely the story that drives the movie ..that makes you like it? And if that ain't enough (i.e. there's something wrong with you and you'll still pay to see this, or -just as with the rest 99% - it's sheer curiosity, like looking at a roadkill) the pure technical side is probably the worst of any recent movie yet. What kills a terminator? what stops a heart? How do the weapons and wars of 201x look like? (did the Vietnam War came back from the past or something?) How hard is it to kill one human f f s? How often you find fuel trucks and nuclear devices just lying around? I mean COME ON ALREADY!!!!!!!!!!! <br/><br/>Let me take 3 steps ahead and say ""Terminate Hollywood"". They mock us with their mass-media tools, they insult our intelligence, they treat us like cattle. Only one thing these people care about: money. Only one solution available: stop paying. Ask for your money back. Stop going to cinemas. And then you'll see some changes and improvements. In the 60s and 70s people were watching cool B movies. So the studios welcomed the new generation of filmmakers, they had to. Today nobody is fresh or original so we would still wait a while, but for a gain. At least you'd save your money and buy 60s and 70s DVDs. I've seen MANY people walk out of movies, all very recently. Change is on the way Hollywood, get with the program or die off."

He ( tried) to sleep, but even that was impossible due to the extremely noise of the continue explosion and more. I was ashamed from ( almost) the start of the movie to the end of it. This film has no plot and no recitation at all. I don't care if CGI is great! this movie was like a big and unbearable long trailer. I wander who did it so bad? Was the direction? The script?

","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br/><br/>We're living in the times of recessionary Hollywood, where the studios aren't willing to take a gamble and old ideas are being trotted out in new format in favour of new ideas. Aside from the collosally pointless part three, the great thing about The Terminator franchise is that however many years were spanned out between the last film, there's always been a point to each new film, so a new Terminator movie is hardly the best example of this. It is, however, an established franchise and as such can hold it's own against the torrent of other commercially driven blockbusters on the cinema screens in the summer.<br/><br/>The story here is set in the future where John Connor has survived as leader of the resistance in the battle against the machines. However, the boy who will grow to be his father, Kyle Reese, is eeking out an existence of his own, hiding in the ruins of modern civilization and running into contact with a mysterious man who it's hard to tell is a member of the resistance or the machines. It's something fans of the franchise will have been looking forward to for years, with a bright new cast (namely, Christian Bale in the lead role) and a glossy new look. Unfortunately, it is a complete case of style over substance.<br/><br/>With the director of the Charlie's Angels films at the helm, this fun but dark franchise had it's fate in uncertain hands to start with. While McG's style might have been ideally suited to the under appreciated (in my opinion) CA films, it might not be as good with a Terminator film. He does get it wrong, but not for the reasons you might have thought, though. A more silly, jolly tone might have been preferable to the onslaught of trite dialogue, thin characterization, weak plotting and wavey story on display here. If all you want is a noisy, effects driven popcorn film with some impressive special effects and CGI, this'll serve you well but as something Terminator fans have been looking forward to for years it's a bit of a let down.<br/><br/>No one expects anything to match the first two, but just something with some genuine affection for the series would be nice. With the ending leaving the room open for another film, one hopes something better comes up next time round. **"
"tcs-victory","3","6","12","16 June 2009"," Did they terminate the story-writers?
","The year is 2018, and the world just got nuked as we all saw in Terminator: rise of the machines. You'd expect that people who survived Judgement Day would suffer from radiation sickness, unless you would have lived in the desert you whole life. But funny enough, in the entire movie not one word is mentioned about radiation sickness... Kyle Reese even lives in a city that has been nuked! Apart from the obvious, there are a lot of other dumb mistakes. Let me just name some of them: <br/><br/>1) The robots miss. They shoot enormous salvo's of bullets. But they all miss their targets. Yeah right, a high-tech robot that misses? It can calculate exact when and where to shoot, so everybody in its line of sight should be dead.<br/><br/>2) Our heroes in this movie are shot at by rockets, grenades, etc. And they impact almost always very near their bodies. And they don't even have a scratch! Believe me, they should have been deaf, if they would survive such an impact anyway.<br/><br/>3) The machines are equipped with a USB port? Why would machines that want to kill humans, put an USB port on their motorcycles? So humans can hack them, an use them against them? sure...<br/><br/>4) Skynet is equipped with all kinds of Human Machine Interfaces like displays, and keyboards. Machines don't need no keyboards and stuff...<br/><br/>5) John Connor puts a radio on the road, and turns the music on high volume. I once put a radio like that in the open and turned the volume to max...It was't even audible at 5 meters away. If you want to make noise in the open and attract some robots, you've got to bring something bigger with you.<br/><br/>6) The resistance are the only people left. Yet they treat each other even worse than the machines do. Skynet does not have to built terminators, the humans will terminate themselves if they continue this way into terminator 5.<br/><br/>7) The humans move and behave like robots themselves. They lose friends and family. But never cry. They just don't give a sh*t. I thought the robots didn't give a sh*t. At one part in the movie, John Connor makes a statement about what the difference is between humans and a machine. Well that scene is totally misplaced after John Connor himself tried to kill a robot that was trying to convince him he was not part of Skynet. Instead of hearing him out, they torture him and use any means necessary to kill him.<br/><br/>8) 80% you see in this movies is stolen from ""War of the worlds"" by Steven Spielberg. Grabbing humans and putting them in containers so they can use them... who thought of that?<br/><br/>9) The rest is stolen from ""The Matrix"". Snake-like robots in the water? Come on...<br/><br/>10) Hitting a steel machine with your fist is a very bad idea. Yet these humans from the future are made steel themselves, it seems. Getting hit by a machine made of steel is even worse. But these humans from the future can take a beating like that. These story-writes should go on a boxing course...and then re-think those scenes.<br/><br/>11) If I were the resistance, I would save my ammunition, since there are no factories left to produce any more ammunition. But our heroes use their weapons as if they're playing with fireworks! They seem to have enough grenades, bullets, rockets to go on for ages... In reality they should spare any ammo they have. You really want to think twice before firing that grenade, you might need it in the future and there are no new supplies.<br/><br/>12) Why are they so obsessed with Kyle Reese dying? As if that would make a difference? They are already in the future. Kyle Reese dead or alive would not make a difference at all. <br/><br/>13) Who is that Cyborg dude? He killed someone? Where is he from? We don't know. All we know is that Skynet created him. The first robot they create, is also the most advanced robot. Funny, and why would they create a human looking killing machine? Oh yeah, to infiltrate the human population. Well if you want to play it that way, why not create some cancer that simply kills all humans. That would make more sense, since robots cannot get ill.<br/><br/>I could go on an on. Hell I could write a whole book about explosions that should have killed people, flying motorcycles that in reality would not have flown at all, dump behavior of people under stress that is written by people who have never even been under stress. T2 was far more better written, and scarier too.<br/><br/>There are so many things wrong these days with the story-lines of movies, it's just painful. They're all multi-billion dollar productions, and they come up with story-lines that are simply rip-offs of other movies? Why? Can't they think of something original?<br/><br/>I had high hopes that Terminator Salvation might just be another original movie just like its predecessors, but I was wrong."

Unfortunately none of the above happened. I can't imagine the board meeting, I'm guessing it went like this ""Right then board erm we have nothing to do, everyone's destroying old films with remakes, I mean did anyone see the new psycho, everyone is also destroying trilogies, decent original work from directors, so why can't we. So I feel it's time we opened up the Terminator franchise again, what we need is a great director"" Everyone shouts the following suggestions how about Spielberg, Scorcese, how about phoning that Cameron bloke ""No no has anyone seen Charlies Angels full throttle, well that's the kind of director we need, one that will help us sell some memorobilia and won't answer back because he has no integrity. Then we'll find the bargain basement actors in Hollywood and have them as support cast. Now we need a great actor mmm Christian Bale, he's the fellow from Batman isn't he good good get him and i'm sure no review will compare him to the dark knight of course. Now the film mmm, let's set it in the future with no real story but have little memories of the past, also stick a fake Arnie in there and we have a film. The board shout ""what about a plot, what about a plot"" Back to head of board "" no they will eat it up and i'll get rich""<br/><br/>This film was shocking and pitiful, I hope that James Cameron comes back and says this is how it should of gone."

","The dictionary defines Lame in the following way:<br/><br/>1. crippled or physically disabled, esp. in the foot or leg so as to limp or walk with difficulty. 2. impaired or disabled through defect or injury: a lame arm. 3. weak; inadequate; unsatisfactory; clumsy: a lame excuse. 4. Slang. out of touch with modern fads or trends; unsophisticated.<br/><br/>It was certainly impaired in terms of story, character depth and development. It was also out of touch in remaining faithful to the already established world of the Terminator so lovingly and skillfully crafted by James Cameron and William Wisher Jr. <br/><br/>The first two films were reflections of society and the fears entwined within our own self destructive nature. Terminator Salvation trivialized Judgment Day by showing us a human resistance with a definite lack of urgency or instinct for survival and in portraying the dominating force of the world who's sole purpose is to kill humans- The Terminator- as something that you could outrun and destroy. SkyNet seemed a little too vengeful or spiteful in it's manner of attempting to orchestrate the death of Kyle Reese and John Connor, which just doesn't make sense. This is SkyNet people, the program that in the instant it became self aware, managed to wipe out the majority of the world's population in one fell hit. <br/><br/>There was nothing original in this film. The lines used from previous Terminators should not have been touched with a flame thrower. At least T:3 attempted something new in the hybrid hot-chick contortionist Terminator. What can the writers of Salvation really put their stamp on? What would they want to put their stamp on? If they want more work I would advise them to disown T:S.<br/><br/>Moon Bloodgood and Sam Worthington's on screen lust fest was a load of crap. Obviously women getting their breasts out in the rain is enough to cement a close and deep character relationship with a cyborg. Oh please. <br/><br/>Useless MCG.<br/><br/>It was an incredibly disappointing experience. It lacked personality. It lacked a spine.<br/><br/>***** To Christian Bale, Bryce Dallas Howard and Sam Worthington: I know times are tough being an actor in a recession and being paid more money than I'll ever see in my life. But surely you know a crap only-for-profit-not-for-art script when you read one.

"celluloidjunky","4","6","12","7 June 2009"," Full Marks to CGI (if that's your thing) but this is a bland, boring movie with little to offer
","Terminator Salvation demonstrates all that is wrong with the modern Hollywood blockbuster. It's a Ford Escort of a movie cleverly disguised as an Aston Martin by a director that sounds like a cheeseburger. The Terminator universe was marvellously established by James Cameron. Terminators in those nostalgic days of film-making were the real deal and they scared you. If you saw a human being in the same frame as Schwarzenegger you knew that Arnie was going to kill them. Back in those days they were full-on killing machines. The same could be said for the less-sorry days of the Aliens franchise. The extraterrestrial stars of those movies were also effective killing machines. It's depressing how far the mighty have fallen. How the students of Fincher, Cameron and Scott have got it all so horribly wrong. Our bad guys are now more pantomimic. Nowadays you'd fancy the small kid's chances of escape. In Terminator Salvation the threat of death should be grandiose considering a landscape plagued with Hunter-Killers, Terminators and other sneaky robotic assassins but I'd gladly fight them in the trenches. Something I most certainly would not do is work anywhere near the bar that Arnie strolls into at the beginning of Terminator 2. Some movies work well when the ante is upped. Look at Aliens. This worked because the scale was well-contained. It was claustrophobic. It was strategic. It was tense and well-paced with a strong human element and a clever cut and thrust story. But more importantly the baddies always retained their sense of threat. The horror was not lost in all the combat and those spooky mothers were still well-hard. And then came Jean-Pierre Jeunet who thought his selfish brand of humour would in some way be endearing to Aliens fans. And then came the woeful Aliens vs. Predator films; an unimaginative holocaust for the franchise in a feeble attempt to cash in on younger generations. Aliens have lost their mojo. They're like any other bad guy. Soon they'll be appearing in the forthcoming A-Team movie if Hollywood gets its way. Terminator Salvation, as with Terminator 3 and the woeful Sarah Connor Chronicles, follows this predictable routine. It replicates other recent blockbusters like Transformers and War of the Worlds by churning out CGI at a canter and sacrificing the gods of characterisation and plot which are always deemed unnecessary these days. At least the Simpson/Bruckheimer High Concept movie usually had interesting human dynamics, ala Crimson Tide. This film is lacking that heart. It lacks the punchy script needed to elevate the boredom. Its CGI, no matter how hard it tries, cannot paint an interesting picture. It is a picture of a future offering nothing new: the usual mix of Blade Runner and Mad Max with a splash of AI. Salvation represents all that is wrong with the industry. It is watered down eye-candy; a car with no engine wrapped up in a lovely glossy veneer. A vehicle that can only be pushed downhill; it cannot go anywhere else. It is that predictable. Why do filmmakers insist on ignoring their fans? The mind boggles when you consider the money and talent pumped into mainstream film-making. How many writers worked on this script? Why are the ideas so mundane? This is a very boring movie. Bale's Connor is uninteresting. The fact he must send his father back in time, ultimately to his death, is conveyed through the usual grunts and snarls used for the battlefield. Sam Worthington's character is woefully handled. He's a terminator unit with a human heart and the memory of his previous life (having been executed years earlier and donated to Skynet). His motivation makes very little sense. His path is so badly handled it could've been conjured up on the back of a fag packet. Stripped of its special effects there is little joy here. This could be a porn film with sex substituted for random action sequences. It's a story about a war against machines. It's episodic. A series of skirmishes for an hour and a half. At no point do you feel the full force of Skynet closing in. There are no strategic developments on the battlefield. No sense of doom. No sense of war. Some of these flaws could be forgiven if the film wasn't so poorly thought through. If Skynet can lock onto your location by setting a car on fire, why, when Worthington escapes Bale's base and the resistance literally launches a nuclear strike against him, is the location of their headquarters not compromised? Why are terminators with rubber skin not shown as predecessors to the more realistic machines? Without consistency with Cameron's universe the film is less creditable. Why aren't dogs used to protect the camps, as they have done so in previous Terminator films? Whilst Terminator Salvation looks good in places, in particular the crash-landing of a helicopter, at other moments the future is simply represented by some deserted highways with overturned cars. The film at least is well-cast, with Anton Yelchin a believable junior Kyle Reese, whilst Worthington, at the very least, has the right presence. What really disappoints about this 12A film is that the machines are easy to beat. In one scene Christian Bale fights a Terminator unit with his bare hands; in fact he does this quite often. Similarly, once the heroes reach Skynet Central the lack of fight from the machines is pathetic. Only in this film can Kyle Reese, nominated as the number one target for Skynet, not be killed once he is positively identified. Indeed, having located Reese, the machines opt to lock him away somewhere so he can be found and rescued. In Cameron's universe, Reese would be dead one second after identification. Cameron's world was scary. This world betrays that realism. When the occasional nice idea flashes by you're screaming at the film, wishing it had been saved for a better movie. But don't worry folks, at least it's wrapped up in a very fetching wrapper called CGI."
"merdiolu","3","6","12","6 June 2009"," Soulless Movie
","The title I wrote above basically describes what me and everyone felt in the theater at the end of movie. Somebody should really get up enough courage and say to Hollywood producers that filling a movie with lots of CGI , pretty explosions and cool looking fight/car chase scenes does not equal to movie making as a cinematic art form. Mindless action and gunfire does not compensate bad and patchy storytelling...<br/><br/>At the beginning of movie it felt something was off. The short scene showing Marcus at death row tries to be dramatic but it is not. The scene and lines said by Marcus and Doctor pass off so fast that it feels forced. Then we do leap into future to 2018 exactly. 15 years after Judgement Day the war between human resistance and Skynet is going on full scale. At this point we gave up watching a sensible dramatic acting or story because US Military Hardware Advertisement starts. Really for the first half of the movie all story ( full of holes by the way ) as it laid out , performance of actors or themes or messages of plot ( if there is any ) is secondary background noise. All of them can be discarded. What we see in primary are A-10 ground ground attack jets launching missiles and pounding their targets , Vietnam-era Huey transport helicopters fly by and men in combat gear carrying assault rifles firing at bandanna wearing terminators ( I am not kidding those terminators and art director or producer of this movie have a horrible fashion sense ) , Hunter-Killer or motorbike terminators are chasing , blowing up pick-ups , cars etc......<br/><br/>It is as if watching Transformers or Iron Man ( two movies I strongly dislike ) again. In visual style , sense and action McG just rips off those two horrible productions of last year. Actors and actresses do their best but writing of character development is very weak ( except Sam Worthington who stand out among others because most of the movie is about his character Marcus ) so Christian Bale does nothing but shooting or fighting or saying heroic things and others are not so bright also ( I especially cringed when Moon Bloodgood or Common spoke...)<br/><br/>Towards the end there is supposedly big showdown between humans and terminators at the heart of machine except it was copied from metal/steel factory scenes in Terminator 2 : Judgement Day here and there...T-800 makes a cameo appearance which is silly at best...After a combination of luck and most convenient factors and coincidences humans triumph...<br/><br/>Well that said Terminator 4 shows how much Hollywood and mainstream visual entertainment sector ( like TV ) has regressed more and more.. Do not bother to spend money on T:4. Just watch Transformers ( still horrible by the way ) instead they are quite similar..."

","I am a terminator fan. I expected T3 to be worth something but it wasn't. TS looked alright form the previews, but the first watch disappointed me.<br/><br/>HOWEVER, I had a chance to see it again, and I was amazed. TS visually captured the symbiotic relationship between john conner and the machines. If you think about T1 and T2, the question of whether or not the machines would exist if it hadn't been for the leftover chip and arm from one comes up. It becomes chicken/egg debate.<br/><br/>Where TS shines is illuminating the fact that the machines and the resistance/john conner, cannot exist without each other. Blurring the lines of where humanity ends and the machine begins.<br/><br/>If you a Cameron fan, then McG will fall short. He uses too much dialogue to develop characters, where Cameron would have kept it lean, and used visuals to illuminate his.<br/><br/>So, if you can get past Common, Yelchin, and some stupid lines, then the movie becomes a moderately good.

"SubZeroMK","10","6","12","28 May 2009"," You'd have to be slow not to understand the story and admire its awesomeness
","What a great movie! It deserves its 10/10 because not only is it action packed, but it expands the story, and it visits the future that was shown in the opening intros for T1, T2, and T3. And as a kid, I've always wanted to see a Terminator film set in the future, and thanks to McG & Warner Bros, I have a film that's set in the future.<br/><br/>Okay, so it's not in 2029, it's in the earlier days, a few years right after Skynet launched their missiles and the humans called it ""Judgement Day"" . You get to see John Connor as a ranking resistance fighter, not in full command, yet, but working his way up there. He still has that rebellious attitude, Edward Furlong had in T2.<br/><br/>Now I won't ride the hate bandwagon and join in to bash T3 or say how Salvation sucks and T2 is the best JUST BECAUSE. Because let's face it, you grew up with Terminator 2, most of you did. I was 2 years old when it came out, so I got to watch it 8 years later. Given the quality of the movie and the director for it, it was a great movie, and it's on Terminator Salvation's level. However, this new movie surpasses it, slightly more. Now don't get all crazy cuz I said that, because I'm a fan. What, because I don't agree with you I'm not a fan? Get the hell outta' here with that crap.<br/><br/>The movie is great, go see it, you have to be really slow, dumb, or just ignorant to not understand the plot of this movie. It's John Connor in his resistance days, rising up to the ranks, to win the war sooner than his mother told him. Marcus Wright comes into play because he volunteered for a Cyberdine program to donate his insides, but he doesn't know he becomes what he becomes later on. I'll try not to spoil it, so don't worry.<br/><br/>The plot later tells us that John needs to save his young, would-be father, Kyle Reese from a Skynet concentration camp. There will be a cameo role in this movie by a special someone you may all know by now, but I won't say anything, because as I mentioned before, I won't say anything spoiler related.<br/><br/>The action is certainly great, great use of the 200 million dollar budget. The Harvester scene is amazing, that's all I'm gonna' say. It's not a mindless action movie as how some people on this site put it out to be, so vividly. I think if you're a Terminator fan, a science fiction fan, a war movie fan, or a fan of Cristian Bale, then you will like this movie. So please, go see it, pay for it so it can make the box office bust, so that I can be another happy camper when they show the trailer for Terminator 5 and 6 thanks to this movie's success at the box office. The only problem I had with it is the fact that it wasn't longer. That is all."
"MovieManiacX","9","6","12","22 May 2009"," Excellent
","Let me start off by saying that Terminator 2: Judgment Day is my all-time favorite film. Because of this, I was very annoyed to hear of another Terminator film being made, let alone by McG. I was all for boycotting the film but then, little by little, things started to look up. First Christian Bale was cast...OK that's great. Then I started seeing things pop up that being a fan of the franchise, made me more interested. Things like the inclusion of Kyle Reese and the only-mentioned T-600 model Terminators. Then the trailer was released and I went from interested to very excited. Swimming Terminators? Cool. Terminator motorcycles? Even better! Badass car chases? Oh hell yes! Then I saw the film itself.<br/><br/>My expectations were met in nearly every regard. The casting was excellent. Christian Bale was superb and very intense and Sam Worthington was great as well. I'm looking forward to seeing Worthington in James Cameron's Avatar. Anton Yelchin was a dead ringer for a young Reese and did a fine job. Everyone else was fine. It was cool to see Michael Ironside in a Terminator film.<br/><br/>The action was spectacular! I love action, especially car chases and I haven't enjoyed a car chase like the one in the film since The Island in 2005. Most of it was live-action too, which only added to my enjoyment. The gunfights and Terminator battles were violent and intense, while the explosions were massive and bone jarring. Needless to say, the action was quite thrilling.<br/><br/>The special effects were top-notch and there was also a surprising amount of live-action effects as well, all of which were utilized to perfection. The cinematography and direction were fantastic. I have a new respect for McG after seeing this film. The score was great as well and only added to the experience, especially the use of the original score from the first two films.<br/><br/>I think the thing I enjoyed the most was the nods to the earlier films that made me realize that the people that made this were really here to make a quality Terminator film, not just a moneymaker. I yelled when Reese said ""Come with me if you want to live"" and and I jumped out of my seat when John Connor played ""You Could Be Mine"" by Guns N' Roses (used by Connor in T2 as well) to attract a MotoTerminator. If you're a fan, this only sweetens the experience.<br/><br/>I had a few gripes, but as I went through them in my head, they're kind of superfluous and might only bother a die hard fan.<br/><br/>All in all, I was impressed and extremely happy with how the film turned out. Go see it on the big screen if you can!"
"lynda_abbott","7","6","12","22 May 2009"," Action, action -- OK but no story or character development
","The best thing about the film is the action sequences -- but the film (sadly) ends up being less than the sum of its parts. There just isn't enough of a story and there's practically no character development -- and that matters ... a LOT! I blame McG for doing a video game rather than a movie that tells an intelligible part of the Terminator saga.<br/><br/>They've got a good cast. Yes, Christian Bale's doing the raspy voice thing (which is very annoying), but he's perfectly acceptable as John Connor. It's just that John Connor isn't -- quite frankly -- very interesting as a character. To me that was a HUGE disappointment. I don't blame Christian Bale for that -- it just isn't a good enough script. (The script is by the same guy who did the script for T-3. What were they THINKING???) Most of the cast is good -- with Anton Yelchin being an especial standout as Kyle Reese as a teenager. He's practically the only person in the film who shows anything like a personality. Again, it's not really the cast's fault. Everyone in the cast does a good job with what little they're given of screen time and a tissue-thin script.<br/><br/>James Cameron did such a terrific job of T-1 and T-2. Two different tales in the Terminator universe, each with a central conflict that mattered to me as a viewer. In T-1 it was Sarah Connor hooking up with Kyle Reese, and the two of them vs. the Terminator intent on killing her. In T-2 it was John Connor as a kid and the Terminator sent to save him, with Sarah as Mom trying to prevent the coming apocalypse. T-3 I won't mention because it was really really lame (partly because Nick Stahl was just totally boring and had completely negative personality as John Connor.) <br/><br/>*** SPOILER ALERT!! Don't read any further if you haven't seen the film yet! <br/><br/>However, in TS (which sadly, DOES stand for ""tough s--t"" in terms of payoff for the audience), there really aren't any relationships at all in this film. Much has been made about the Marcus Wright story -- the cyborg who thinks he's a man -- but I don't think that really worked particularly well. Anything resembling internal conflict for Marcus Wright about this situation is not really developed. (Yelling at the sky and howling while chained up is NOT the same as character development. The closest he comes to showing a reaction is when he's viewing the video message from Helena Bonham Carter's scientist character.) When we get to the end and Marcus makes his sacrifice for John Connor, I could see how this story was possibly INTENDED to add up -- but it's just not there on screen. Pretty sad.<br/><br/>Too many of the pop-video directors that have graduated to the big screen have this weird and distorted sense of storytelling. They frame the pictures nicely and can do short action sequences well -- but their movies tend to turn into a senseless sequence of ""this happens"" and then ""this happens,"" and on and on through the film. But a story that isn't told well -- and this one isn't -- just doesn't add up in the end.<br/><br/>There is so much in this movie that just isn't needed. For example, take the gas-station scene -- please! There's a bunch of East L.A. former gang guys who all get wasted and only their ""earth mother,"" Jane Alexander (who deserves MUCH better treatment than this!) gets saved simply because the ""Harvester"" grabs her and throws her in the ""collecting"" car. So what was the whole point of all that?? (Is she only there to keep an eye on Star at the Skynet labs so we won't worry about who's looking after her when Kyle is taken elsewhere???) Bryce Dallas Howard is a good actress, but she's totally wasted in this film (except to be able to perform very complex transplant surgery at a moment's notice in a field hospital with almost no visible equipment available -- a fairly incredible feat). The whole Blair Williams and Marcus Wright interaction is too much of a cliché and not very believable (she's been tramping cross-country with this guy for about a day and yet she's ready to betray John Connor and everyone she knows and has been working with in the Resistance in favor of this cyborg?? Not too believable.) This just illustrates one of the central problems of the film, in that the focus keeps shifting from John Connor to Marcus Wright to Kyle Reese. Whose story is supposedly being told here? The shift in focus only compounds the sense of just plodding through one scene after the next without really developing anything meaningful.<br/><br/>When the film ends, there's no sense of ""completion"" or ""pay-off"" or ""satisfaction"" in the story, as there was with T-1 and T-2.<br/><br/>I'm all in favor of more Terminator movies -- with this same cast. I just hope they get a script that's MUCH MUCH better, and a director that knows the difference between a good story and a video game."

I finally got around to watching Terminator Salvation the other night, to finally see the last one of the franchise that I had yet to see, and... it was great! Probably the best one of the franchise aside from Terminator 2.<br/><br/>And yet, critics and the fanbase attacked this as one of the worst? What? I don't get it. Goes to show that angry fanboy attitudes extend beyond Star Wars prequels & superhero reboots. Try something a little different and the so-called fans will revolt...<br/><br/>I liked seeing a war-against-the-machines movie set entirely in the future, with no time travel storyline. I liked the intense action style, shot with hand-held cameras, like you're on the ground with the soldiers in the middle of a warzone. I liked that every robot and war-machine, from the machine-gun toting Terminators to the sleek black motorcycles to the giant mecha ones, had dangerous and a threatening presence.<br/><br/>The Sam Worthington storyline was intriguing and unique. Is he still a man or a machine or what? If I had to complain about anything though, it's that Sam Worthington's accent noticeably slips into distinctly non-American on more than a handful of instances throughout the movie.<br/><br/>Anyway, it was all pretty cool. What's not to like?"

","Petman predicted.<br/><br/>one of my favorite movies out. This movie scares the sh*t out of me cause this could really happen in a century or less.

","Though it was different from the original films, I enjoyed this film none the less. I love the Terminator, and maybe it wasn't the best of the series, but I enjoyed it as a separate film. It was fast paced with well developed characters, I found it interesting enough to watch. But one thing I didn't really enjoy the the dark, solemn portrayment of John Conner. It didn't really fit his earlier character. <br/><br/>I have to admit I did hear Marcus's accent slip through a couple times, but overall I think he added a lot of charisma to the film. The actor who played Kyle Reese, a genuine and believable was a joy to watch on screen as well. The atmosphere of the movie was a little gloomy, but I loved the look on the post apocalyptic dessert and the CG of the labs. I didn't regret watching this movie and it kept my attention all the way through. I liked it."
"bob the moo","Null","4","7","9 December 2009"," A solid blockbuster but no more than that
","I wasn't too fussed about seeing this film when it came out initially. It just struck me as yet another big noisy action movie and, while that kind of comes with the time of year, I just wasn't really in the mood for it and the average reviews didn't help. A cheap matinée changed my mind in regards watching it but what I found was more or less what I had been led to expect. The film offers much, this is the first time in the franchise that the action occurs during the reign of Skynet – previously we have only had clips of the future. Like most people this is one thing that I was looking forward to seeing and it is one of the ways that I think the film first sort of fudges things.<br/><br/>Instead of the depressing bleak survival that we knew of from the first film, here the future seems a lot more organised and, well, militarised. I'm not really going to get into the logic or lack of logic in the plot but it doesn't feel like mankind is on the ropes or is on the run – indeed at times you wonder how Skynet can miss this much activity going on. Anyway this isn't really much of a problem because it does allow for more in the way of action and explosions. In this regard the film does deliver to a point, because it is noisy, have good pace and has plenty going on. This is not enough though because I rarely cared about the characters or felt an urgency to the events on screen. It is hard to describe but the film didn't get my pulse going or thrill me – instead it was just distracting for what it was but nothing more than that.<br/><br/>This is caused by the characters being lost in the middle of all this plot and action. We have some good actors in there but nobody manages to do much. Some have complained that the film lacks the fun of some of the other films but I can understand this given the setting for the fourth film and the substance of the film being about the nature of being human etc. However, if this is the excuse then the film should have been much more engaging than it was but what it actually does is wear the seriousness like a cloak without really doing much with it. Bale uses his deep voice and troubled look but he has nothing of interest to do with his very interesting character other than look troubled and be gruff. Worthington is better because he has a more interesting character, again the material could have done more with him but he does well with what he has. Bloodgood is cute, Yelchin looks like who he is meant to be, Carter distracts by being overly famous for her role, Ironside is solid, Common fails to make up for Universal Mind Control with his film and Jadagrace is just the unwelcome ""cute kid"" even if she does it well. The effects are the biggest part of the film and generally it does all look very good and move very well, again adding to the film being ""solid"".<br/><br/>And that is what it is – solid. Not spectacular, not thrilling, not engaging, not a great film and not a particularly good addition to the franchise. It is not a bad film by any means and it worked reasonably well as a noisy blockbuster but generally it has too little going on behind the noise and doesn't justify the serious tone that it has. Take a look but don't expect too much."
"liamtoh55","8","4","7","30 June 2009"," Thuroughly Enjoyable.
","The previous Terminator movies, and other similar sci-fi action flicks have taught us to expect a lot of fights and explosions, but not much acting. This movie completely shattered this preconception. Lets face it, although Christian Bale is one of the finest actors alive today, his recent blockbusters (this included) haven't given him much scope to perform. However, Sam Worthington (who I hadn't heard of before this film) really acted his socks off to create a deep, three-dimensional character - which is simultaneously difficult to do considering his character AND quite a pun keeping todays' CGI standards in mind. I have also been keeping an eye on young Anton Yelchin since his brief appearance in Curb Your Enthusiasm, seeing him in Alpha Dog, and then catching up with him again in Star Trek and now this. This young guy is a very talented actor, who could easily be the next DiCaprio. To get to the point, this is a very exciting pop-corn flick portraying the stories of two important men in this fictional future battlefield, which has been coupled with great acting from all angles (ahem! aside from Common). Go and see it!"
"chn65","2","4","7","29 June 2009"," Why ""salvation"" ?
","They have turned Terminator into a soap opera. There can be a Terminator 5, 6, 7, 8, .... simply because neither T3 nor T4 live up to the promises made by T1 and T2. And neither will T5 or T999.<br/><br/>We all know, that Kyle (and T-800-Arnold) must be sent back in time, because that's what happened in T1 and T2. It didn't happen in T4 either, so maybe in the next Terminator movie. Maybe. Unless it can be postponed, while the makers squeeze some money out of the audience.<br/><br/>The movie is so full of quotes from other movies (Matrix, Alien, even Mars Attacks), that it does not have an identity of it's own. What a shame.<br/><br/>The story is not well-told. It looks like, they scanned a computer program over a database of movies to see what works (sells) and what does not. ""Hey, that lift-scene in Alien was good, we must use it too.""<br/><br/>Why is Skynet so incompetent, that it is unable to protect it's own base a little bit better? After killing a few robots they are able to land on the roof with slow-moving helicopters ...come on! There are a gazillion other big holes in the story which simply makes it lack any credibility. There is not space enough on the internet to list it all.<br/><br/>I liked a few things, though. The Marcus man/machine (which could actually have been an interesting character, if they had had some story-writers not thinking like 12-year olds) was a good idea. He was even the main character. The rebellious bad guy turns good. The eternal conflict between good and evil - in most American films, the good side wins, because that sells better.<br/><br/>The CGI Arnold was expected. But I had expected to see a factory spawning Arnold's by the 1000's. They made one (1) which was shown for less than 20 seconds, and which was easily defeated. They only did it because they felt they had to, I guess. Maybe there will be more of them in T5, if they make T5.<br/><br/>COME ON, YOU CAN DO BETTER THAN THIS. But these days, it is not about creating quality (not to say ""art""), that the makers can be proud of. Everything is sacrificed, because the one and only thing that counts is revenue.<br/><br/>They re-write the script until the audience likes it enough ... no artist does like that. It's next to prostitution.<br/><br/>A shame and a big shame. It could have been an interesting movie.<br/><br/>And by the way - why is it called ""Salvation ?"" Nobody gets saved ... nobody even wins. The voice-over in the end clearly points out, that there will be a sequel and then another sequel and then a new one ...<br/><br/>Big-time disappointment. An insult to the fans. Be ashamed. Be very ashamed."
"silentcheesedude","7","4","7","18 June 2009"," Terminator: The Scooby Dooby DOO version!
","The Terminator series, from T3, the TV show and this new one, would be best described as a ""loosely based alternate reality where different things take place than what the director and writer intended years ago, and would make no sense if you pieced them together using your sisters doll house for props"". Quotes my own.<br/><br/>This I figured out within minutes of seeing T3. The John Connor we saw was not the same John from the 2nd. And this new Connor isn't the same from ANY of them, not that we saw much of him from the future in the first place. After T3, I stopped thinking and instead did what a lot of people should do... shut up and enjoy the big pretty flashes of light and the BOOM! Crash! sounds.<br/><br/>This new Terminator takes place in the future rather then the present. Christian Bale, who plays Connor, was originally slated for Marcus, a much better role. Bale wanted to play Connor, and in the end, gets a less exciting part to play. Bryce Dallas Howard has little to do here. Her part could have been omitted and no one would have noticed. Everyone else is OK.<br/><br/>There's nothing really unpredictable about what is going to happen. Good guys go after bad guys, bad guys look like they are winning, good guys make a better plan. Oh, I can also go into the bad loopholes and tell you that these supposedly hard-to-kill terminators don't know how to kill humans very well, or how security at Skynet is a joke. I laughed at the FM radios used for communication. Yeah. Like Skynet isn't going to catch us on THAT. OH, and the time travel thing. It's not in the movie, so we have to assume it hasn't been invented yet, so HOW can Skynet know the significance of one Kyle Reese? But I won't go into that. Most any sci-fi is going to have these, and sequels have them plenty. None of that compares than placing McG in charge here, director of such fine award-winning pieces like Charlie's Angels 1 and 2. When the fight broke out between Bale and the cinematographer during a scene, McG said he didn't see it. Where was he? Was he clicking through his Scooby-Doo Viewfinder? And the writers? They wrote Catwoman. And just like that, 1000 people decided not to watch Terminator Salvation after checking that fact.<br/><br/>But seriously, forget all that. I'm making it sound like it's a bad movie or something. Nah. It's exactly what I want to see in a summer blockbuster. New types of terminators, a few good fights, a great helicopter scene in the beginning, and even Ah-Nuld. It won't even get you in trouble with your mom, it's PG-13ized!"

","I normally do not bother writing a review for a film which received as many reviews as Terminator Salvation has done mainly because I believe that my input would just be lost in the huge pool. But I have to say that this film angered me so much that I had to break the habit...<br/><br/>Acting: In a word - Terrible. The best actor/actress was the little mute girl. That's how badly I rated the actors/actresses' performances. I won't name anyone in particular because everyone was as bad as each other.<br/><br/>Action: Nothing special that I haven't already seen in another war blockbuster or Terminator movie. This film steals many ideas from the past Terminator movies.<br/><br/>Storyline: The worst element of the film. There was absolutely nothing convincing about the storyline and definitely nothing that was original. The film stole many ideas from the old Terminator films (dialogue and action sequences). Characters developed feelings for each other without any substantial reason.<br/><br/>Special Effects: Not much to speak about here. Terminator 2 featured more state of the art effects in comparison. The only thing that impressed me was the T800 and how they made it look exactly like Arnie from the first Terminator.<br/><br/>Direction: McD should stick to directing TV shows and music videos. However, the sponsors are ultimately to blame for giving this film into the wrong hands."

After Terminator 3 I thought any sequel will be worse, but no.<br/><br/>Terminator Salvation contains this nice 80's Terminator 1 + 2 atmosphere (which 3 hadn't) it's not just about action it also contains elements of horror and helpless situations which really reminded me of Terminator 2.<br/><br/>You gotta watch that in movie in cinema, it's really awesome! The big machines, you see all the details of the terminators. You have a special guest act, great horrifying sound which someway reminded me of Silent Hill and all in all great action.

For example, there's wooden acting aplenty, with Christian Bale surprisingly bad as John Conner. The act who steals the show is Sam worthing, or whatever his name was, I can't remember, as Marcus. And also, it seems Earth is in pretty darn good condition for having being repeatedly bombed several years earlier by nuclear missiles.

","Part 3 was not all bad,but not great either, it could have been more than what it was. But Terminator Salvation makes up for T3 mistakes.<br/><br/>Now set in the year 2018, humans are at war with Skynet, the company that makes the terminators. The leader of the resistance John Conner(Christian Bale) is trying to get Kyle Reese(Star Treks Anton Yelchin) before the terminators get him, and Conner knows that is his father, if does not get to him first, he might never exist. A stranger named Marcus(Sam Worthington) with a mysterious past, comes to help. But is unsure to trust him. Will they get to Kyle before it's too late?<br/><br/>Although it is not quite as good as 1 and 2, Terminator Salvation does come into it's own. Christian Bale, Bryce Dallas Howard, Moon Bloodgood, Anton Yelchin are all good and do alright. But it's Sam Worthington that pretty much takes the picture as Marcus. Because it seems at times he is the star of the movie, because he gets more scenes then anybody. But still an entertaining film, with incredible action. So don't miss Terminator Salvation."
"j-child247","9","4","7","6 June 2009"," A brilliant addition to the Terminator saga.
","Short and sweet, I thought this was brilliant, the reason I gave it 9 out of 10 was due to the age certification, but in the end I'm contradicting myself only because it was such a good film that it didn't need gore or excessive violence.<br/><br/>This is not the usual take on the Terminator; The Conner's vs The Terminator/Skynet. Instead we're seeing humanity fighting for it's survival against an emotionless killing machine. The film obviously follows John Conner but thankfully they leave out the brooding, harrowing, depressed character that got milked to death in the Terminator: The Sarah Conner Chronicals series. Instead we see the military type 'saviour' that Linda Hamelton's character strives for her son to be in Terminator 2.<br/><br/>There are also some great moments that pay homage to the first 2 films that go down really well as well as the fact that we get so see The Terminator himself in all his CGI glory which only adds to the excitement.<br/><br/>This is really a good movie, in fact they could have skipped part 3 and gone straight to this one.<br/><br/>Go see it and enjoy it!"

","Where do I begin?When I first saw the cast I instantly noticed something was really wrong!What is Helen Bonham doing in a movie like this?But still,she isn't the biggest problem it's Christian Bale who in my opinion was the worst choice for this role(just like in Batman).First of all what is with that voice?Eversince Batman he keeps deforming his voice,but why?It's pointless!But anyways on to the movie.The first future scene was not that bad but it was a little average(James Cameron gave a better view of the future in 1984).And after that came the first really hard slap in the face.In the first 3 movies it was like this:John Connor is THE LEADER of the resistance, who runs and controls everything.Than what is he doing taking orders from some general's in a submarine????And after that the story just rolls on nothing special just a few different machines(big deal)and than finally the main characters meet bla bla bla BORING.After that some interesting and cool action (at least I thought).They get into some Skynet facility ,but why couldn't they done that 10 years earlier is way beyond me.Anyway it SUCKS.And the end now the end is where I really got mad.The big ""thing"" in this movie was John to rescue his father Kyle Reese and send him back to 1984.Thats it!!Than why is the subtitle called Salvation????When first seen I though ""oh finally the battle between humanity and the machines will be over"" but no.We still have to wait for that in the sequel.Because why make 1 shitty movie when you can make 2!!Oh and the director Mr MCG,go back to directing Charlies Angels and leave cult movies to the professionals ;) When T3 came out i was wondering why James Cameron didn't direct it.Now I know.......

It is reminiscent of the grittiness of the first film, from the computer like credits, to the title introducing 2018 - a real terminator fans dream.<br/><br/>Christian Bale is John Connor and without a doubt adds weight to the film with his acting ability. Sam Worthington as Marcus Wright is the future; he will become a great star. Both he and Bale are the glue to this instalment. <br/><br/>Moon Bloodgood's brief but pivotal appearance is very good and Helena Bonham Carter gives heartfelt cameo. My hat goes off to newcomer Anton Yelchin as he does a great job of 'becoming' Michael Biehn's Kyle Reese. The only negative remark I have is that Bryce as Kate doesn't get enough to do and because of this is very detached from the character Claire Danes portrayed in the third film.<br/><br/>MCG & the writers have constructed and crafted the film well and the music score by ever reliable Elfman compliments it nicely. A welcomed voice from the past show up to add icing to the cake. The effects are great throughout apart from the showcase skin covered T800 at the end. It was nice to see 'Arnie' and I hope there's more of him digitally in the future. It did look a little rushed but nothing could spoil this original and welcomed spin on this new Terminator movie that welcomely sticks close to the original subject matter.<br/><br/>This should please true Terminator fans and satisfy new comers."
"pootc","7","4","7","4 June 2009"," The visuals are stunning, the action breath-taking, and the drama heavy ...
","Set in 2018 after the bombs have dropped, the machines have risen and humanity is on the brink and John Connor (Christian Bale) is our only hope. Or is he? Terminator Salvation follows the horrendous Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines (2003) with McG (Charlie's Angels) at the helm. But unlike the previous instalment a concentrated effort has been made by McG to take care of the core audience by respecting and acknowledging the source material/ mythology that series creator James Cameron created in the first two films.<br/><br/>Gone are the inflatable breasts, the soft-porn lighting, the cheesy one-liners and the cringe-worthy humour that buried Terminator 3. In fact it's almost like that T3 never happened - almost. ""Judgement Day happened"", explains a young Kyle Reese in Salvation and that is all that matters.<br/><br/>As for the story, it's simple. The original was about saving Sarah Connor, the second was about saving John Connor and Salvation is about saving a young Kyle Reese. Christian Bale is John Connor, the man fated to lead humanity to victory against Skynet and its army of machines. He plays the part with a lot of grunt, reminiscent of Linda Hamilton in Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991) and while critics loathe the performance citing he lacked charisma, I enjoyed it. This is how Connor should be portrayed, a no holds barred soldier, rising the ranks with the weight of the world on his shoulders. But surprisingly its the addition of Sam Worthington and his portrayal of Marcus Wright - a prisoner on death row who donates his body to science only to awaken 15 years later as frankenstein so to speak is the most compelling part of Salvations plot, striking a petite emotional chord between the explosions.<br/><br/>The other minor characters serve their purpose but Anton Yelchin absolutely nails it as a young Kyle Reese - and obviously did his homework replicating Michael Biehn's mannerisms in the original film. One of many nice touches in Salvation.<br/><br/>With all these positives, thats not to say the film didn't have its share of problems. The editing was choppy in parts and felt incomplete, or rushed. The score by Danny Elfman was adequate but not what I'd call memorable one like Brad Fidel's and the character development was again adequate but there just could've been more of those quiet moments to pull us in. That's the difference between a good movie and a great one.<br/><br/>Salvation is indeed a slice Salvation for this franchise, and although it doesn't quite pack the same emotional punch as Cameron's work - the world is gritty, the visuals stunning, the action breath-taking, and the drama heavy setting it back in the right direction."
"j.evans-2","8","4","7","4 June 2009"," Big on spectacle and drama, some plot holes
","One early scene was very much like a scene from 'Transformers' (2007), when the humans were experimenting on a 'hydrobot' (swimming, snake-like terminator) on a table. When Connor blew up the Skynet central building towards the end with a small nuclear explosion, the helicopter in which he was escaping didn't suffer total electrical failure after the electro-magnetic pulse of the blast. That chopper should have crashed. The writers of 'True Lies' and 'The Matrix' knew about the e.m. pulse effect years ago. The Skynet army seemed to behave in an arbitrary way. Some humans were killed quickly while others were captured with great effort and skill. How did the machines make their choices? This film felt like it was cobbled together and liberally sprinkled with 'previous good bits' (Arnie, mini-guns, legless terminators, chases, etc.)."
"neil-476","7","4","7","4 June 2009"," Enjoyable blood and thunder, but no classic
","Now that we have four of them, it is interesting to look at the Terminator series of movies.<br/><br/>Number one is high concept - the simple idea of an unstoppable machine pursuing a helpless victim, it is a chase movie, pure and simple, albeit with an interesting - and necessary - role reversal where Sarah and Kyle switch who is protector and who is helpless victim. Supercharged by Scharzenegger's signature performance, it is almost an exercise in simplicity.<br/><br/>Number two did much more than just offer more of the same. Rather than repeat, it echoed and developed. The first one cost peanuts, the second cost a great deal more, but it was all up on the screen. Plus it had cutting edge special effects, albeit the effects where wholly in service to the story rather than vice versa.<br/><br/>Number three, made without James Cameron's involvement, was more of a romp than the first two. While it developed the story further it didn't carry the weight of its predecessors and, although it did have the courage to offer a resolutely downbeat ending, it was quite different in feel to the first two which, despite the disparity in production values between them, were very a pair.<br/><br/>And so we come to number four. Terminator:Salvation is the first of the movies to be set wholly in the post-Armageddon world which we have glimpsed briefly in the previous three movies and, as such, has a completely different feel to it, almost to the extent that it isn't entirely fair to make comparisons with any of the others. This is an out-and-out sci-fi action thriller, loaded up with physical and visual effects, building on the story elements laid out in the earlier movies but, without losing sight of those elements, building its own story.<br/><br/>I was pleased to find out that John Connor is almost a secondary character, and that the story rests on the shoulders of Marcus Wright. Along the way we meet Connor (Christian Bale), of course, together with Kate (a wasted Bryce Dallas Howard), and we are introduced to the young Kyle Reese (Anton Yelchin). But the story arc of Marcus Wright drives the story, and it is a good arc, both in its own right and also in the way it ties into the main Terminator elements. In particular, I enjoyed the symmetry in the character's first and final sequences in the movie.<br/><br/>The movie is not without flaws - there is no real substance to it, to be fair. But it is always eye catching and involving, and is an undemanding popcorn movie.<br/><br/>But my favourite moment came from a fellow audience member, who let out several involuntary whoops of delight when something particularly unexpected happened about 10 minutes from the end!"

If it was up to me i would just pop the Terminator 2 DVD and have fun for the x-time :)<br/><br/>I wont spoil anything but the effects where top notch as was the action packed with adrenalin scenes and a fantastic wall of sound at least in my theater<br/><br/>If i could rate the sound it was even better than the film itself,believe me its one of those rare occurrences.<br/><br/>Compared to the older terminator films it easily sh*&@ on terminator 3 which imho should never been made.<br/><br/>All in all its a good film not masterpiece but worth your money and in my opinion this is the real Terminator 3 not that sh**^ 2003 movie<br/><br/>Rating 7.5/10"
"rossg2742","3","4","7","3 June 2009"," Disappointing
","I get it. This film has a lot to live up to and I really do believe (deep down) that director Joseph McGinty (or as he would like to be called McG...... hmmm) believed that he could do it, that he could raise the bar, that he could make the damn best terminator film that has ever been made! I really believe that he thought that despite his past flicks being somewhat 'lightweight' he had it in him to make a decent, entertaining, and enthralling action movie.<br/><br/>So when asked the question, is Terminator Salvation a worthy entry to the James Cameron inspired cannon that is The Terminator and is it, most importantly, a decent standalone movie that, while pandering to the enthusiasts and fans, will still stand out as something fresh and new and innovative? Sadly the answer to these questions is no... Not really... Well maybe slightly with the latter... but not much.<br/><br/>The problem is not the idea, or how they went about it. Who hasn't wanted to see the post apocalyptic war between man and machine so briefly glimpsed in the first two films? Who, when they heard Christian Bale had been appointed as the sultry hero John Conner thought hmmm that not a very good choice. All the signs pointed to a film that had the potential to be a real classic. Or at least something entertaining enough that doesn't keep making you think how Batman could do with a packet of strepsils. No the problem is with the execution of the whole damn thing.<br/><br/>The script feels contrived, condescending and altogether pretty crap (and that's just the c's). At times we are left feeling like a five year old being walked through a fairly simple plot with reigns, kid gloves and a crash helmet thrown in for good measure. The few poignant moments available are slow, lazy and disappointingly boring, offering little insight into our characters and failing to make us care if a T-800 burst through the wall and sliced them in half with a mini gun... on second thoughts, that would have been preferable. This is truly the biggest failing of the film. Not making us care! Furthermore, the action sequences feel rushed, the cinematography looks cheap lamentably lacking style or invention and the plot holes are so big you could drive Arnold Schwarzenegger through them. <br/><br/>And all of these complaints, I'm afraid lie squarely with our Irish River-Dancing, Gangsta-Rapping Director. Unfortunately, at least on this evidence McG is not very talented. Maybe that's a bit harsh; he possibly makes a great omelette. However, when it comes to film-making... maybe River-Dance would have been a better career path. I honestly believe the man went into this with an enormous amount of self belief I just wish that someone had said, ""No... Stop it... Bad McG... Bad!""<br/><br/>James Cameron is possibly (and debatably) one of the greatest visionaries in modern cinema. At the very least he is a man who knows what he wants and what he has to do to achieve that. And while understandably, he is a hard act to follow, some attempt should have been made to secure a director who had some artistic intuition if not some style! This film was a big gig, only instead of the Who or the Rolling stones we got the pussy cat dolls... the wrong act!<br/><br/>I really wanted to like this film but sadly I found myself looking forward more to seeing Transformers 2 than a Terminator film. And that is sad... Bring on Michael Bay!"
"yasserasco","8","4","7","3 June 2009"," McG is brilliant!!
","I saw it today and boy was I happy that I did....simply brilliant.<br/><br/>The story was solid and made perfect sense, I read many reviews here and went knowing that I will be disappointed but never happened. McG did a really great job, I was simply blown away by the action not worthless stuffed action, no, perfectly detailed action scenes, you will enjoy every minute of it especially that the sound was smoking HOT.<br/><br/>This instalment definitely lives up to the T1 and T2 reputation....one example of what you will experience is a perfectly mastered chopper crash, the way the scene was shot leaves you with one emotion....WOW."
"honorhorror","8","4","7","2 June 2009"," It deserved better reviews, although it's too much like Equilibrium.
","Saw it in Bangkok last Sunday. The first impression: the negative reviews don't do this film justice.<br/><br/>Before seeing it, I was expecting nothing but a series of relentless, silly action. But the actions itself came out to be much more than that. Compared to the other two big budget actioners(Wolverine and Star Trek), the special effects in the movie are more genuine and never compromised the film's credibility. All the stunts and terminators' mechanics are well combined and polished NEATLESSLY by CGI. All the action sequences are well placed and nearly perfectly choreographed. They may be intentionally compared with the old Terminator films on the aspect of originality. But let's say it's 21st century and Terminator should learn to fit the audiences on certain new standards.<br/><br/>Terminator Salvation is quite a surprise from a director famous for bad movies like Charlie's Angels. Again TS is not compromising at all. It succeeded in bringing John Connor to life as THE war hero. The first two movies took great advantage of the formula of sending a cyborg to past to eliminate John Connor. The audiences can blend the fear for the post-apocalypse future and the cyborg crisis in a modern time in their mind. However the formula didn't work the 3rd time as the time-line of the movie marched forward and audiences found it difficult to follow all those time traveling paradox stuff(especially in the TV series). In previous entries, the adult John Connor was simply a plot tool who wields USA national flag and takes for granted human's victory. This, however, becomes a major hinder of new entries in the series. It seemed to the audiences that John Connor would never grow up into that anticipated savior in bone and flesh. The screenwriter had definitely done their homework on deciding Connor's role in this movie. They finally figured a way out for the series--tuning him down. This is really very wise because it gave Connor more space to develop and brought the details around him to a level of credibility. Yet, the wiser thing is that Connor is not the core character. This may give you a minor let down because you'd expect something out of Christian Bale. However, he merely gave something similar to Batman plus a little more dry speech, dry shouting, helpless sense. Not his fault anyway. The movie's core character is Marcus the Terminator, who thinks he's a human. Sam Worthington presents Marcus with heart and worth a nod.<br/><br/>The only drawback of the film is the plot is a little too much like Equilibrium, which ironically also stars Christian Bale. The whole idea of the resistance wanted to end the war once and for all plus Skynet's conspiracy of using Marcus as an unconscious spy is totally recognizable. Even the twist get unfolded in the same way as Equilibrium, by showing you a changing CGI face on a big screen. Still, this is a forgivable flaw and the movie is well directed to the conclusion.<br/><br/>8/10 A must-see in the summer."
"DukeofNewYorkA1","3","4","7","31 May 2009"," Disappointing, almost Terrible
","Do not be fooled by the brilliant 2nd trailer - this movie is bad in almost every single aspect. While you won't curse yourself for going to see it, absolutely every part of the film is mediocre at best. How a character like ""McG"" got handed a $200 million budget, the hottest movie star in the planet in Bale, and the TERMINATOR franchise is more than beyond me. Very disheartening - and I'm not even a giant Terminator fan. First one is great, second one is watchable (would have been far more watchable minus Edward Furlong).<br/><br/>Literally EVERY SINGLE action movie cliché is present in this film. From the typical hard-line general who is out of touch screaming ""dammit this is war"" to the awkward insertion of female romantic interests to the warehouse fight, watching the movie makes it abundantly clear that the writers/director do not have an original idea of their own. Also, the COMPLETELY UNNECESSARY child character who conveniently doesn't speak is distracting. Even the teenage Reese, despite good buzz, is handled poorly. Why Hollywood continually tries to insert teenagers into serious action roles is beyond me.<br/><br/>Even Bale, an actor who I think highly of, clearly phones this in as his character has nothing to work with. For some background, the character of John Conner was originally only a small part of this story but Bale was only interested in playing him, not Marcus, so massive and last minute rewrites occurred. Not that the original script would have been better (it wasn't), but the lack of polish screams out to the viewer.<br/><br/>With no real enemy to learn/care about, the movie sputters along. Instead of an all encompassing war like the previous movies alluded to, there is sporadic fighting instead. Hell, whole human towns/bases are above ground and completely vulnerable. A giant opportunity to create a an amazing new universe and raise whole new generation of Terminator/sci-fi fans has been lost. The dialogue is horrific, the action lame, the story lacking a reason to justify itself, and phoned in performances. At least this is most likely the end of McG and the Terminator franchise (and hopefully any serious attempts at big-time film projects)."
"george.schmidt","8","4","7","27 May 2009"," Affective and intense entry of the franchise
","TERMINATOR SALVATION (2009) *** Christian Bale, Sam Worthington, Moon Bloodgood, Helena Bonham Carter, Anton Yelchin, Jadagrace, Bryce Dallas Howard, Common, Jane Alexander, Michael Ironside. Relatively decent and entertaining but a tad stilted chapter in the sci-fi actioner franchise set in 2018 with an adult John Connor (a very intense Bale) facing a bleak future where Skynet, the nefarious powers that be, have unleashed an apocalyptic hell-on-earth with robots laying waste in their wakes. The only hope is in saving his father-to-be, rebel Kyle Reese (an affective Yelchin) and mysterious Marcus Wright (newcomer Worthington who makes for an efficient cipher) may be the road to salvation. Directed with bombastic style to spare by McG, the film coasts on its mythic yarn with some awesome displays of action set pieces (the chase sequences are worth the price of admission) but admittedly the final act is on shaky ground with the opening possibility of natch another sequel down the line."
"aplardi","1","4","7","27 May 2009"," Terminator Failvation
","The Terminator franchise has been a part of me since my childhood. I absolutely loved The Terminator as a horror movie with a few great action scenes because of the likable characters and the way Arnold was portrayed. Terminator 2 followed up by fleshing out the story of John Connor's importance a little more and showing a hardened Sarah Connor. T3 a different story though, while it was entertaining it had moments that just made you cringe.<br/><br/>I don't know where to start so I'll do this old school: categories.<br/><br/>Dialog: Terminator Salvation presents you with an opening scene meant to make you feel for a new, unfamiliar character. But they leave out so many details about his history that you just don't get pulled in. Then comes flashing forward to John Connor fighting with his ""superior"" located on the resistance base a sub. We have some really fantastic actors in this movie performing lines that are as flat and meaningless as the romance dialog between Padme and Anikan, and I liked those movies.<br/><br/>Story: There is almost no redeeming value in this movie. The story isn't there. The events are predictable but the story is just a wavering pile of inconsistencies, lacking a climax and satisfying ending. Never are you in anticipation of what is going to happen next, never do you feel concerned about any of the missions at hand, and never did you have really want for these characters to succeed.<br/><br/>Characters: John Connor has the potential to be a real on screen hero. We have never seen him be that though, just some guy trying to avoid the future. (Not counting the excellent Television interpretation). So who better to portray man's salvation than Christian Bale, one of the most compelling actors in recent cinema. We'll Christian I won't blame you for this as the script only featured you for about 40 minutes of the movie (or so it felt). Maybe I will blame you for not reading the script before signing onto this pile of garbage.<br/><br/>His wife Kate is also a total moron on screen. Okay how about this: you are pregnant and part of an endangered species. Do you a) run into a battlefield when you don't need to or cannot even contribute anything, or b) stay in the base. STAY IN THE BASE! Marcus, the other main character has a great current story that we don't care about because of a mystery back story that we WANT to know more about. His decision in the end of the film would have carried more weight if we understood why he needs this second chance.<br/><br/>Action & Special Effects: Where do I start? How about the actual machines? They look okay. Gritty enough to be realistic but the way they are portrayed isn't scary. I don't feel like I did in the past movies where they were an actual threat. Here they are just not interesting or at all threatening. That said there is a moment in the film that is meant to seem big, really big. We see a CGI Arnold. Who looks super fake and weak to the point of you being taken out of the film. I'll touch on this in my conclusion.<br/><br/>Conclusion and other matters: Okay I wanted to tie all these things together by expressing my feeling about this so called climax of the film. The machines found a way to draw John Connor into their base thereby being able to destroy him. Logically, as a machine should think they put him in a room with all the terminators they have to destroy him once and for all. He dies and it's over so sad. WAIT WHAT? They put him in a locked room with one terminator (CGArnold), a machine who John Connor has been familiar with since he was 12. Now that's some good, logical decision making isn't it?<br/><br/>I love this franchise, but this movie made me feel empty inside. I guess that's all as I don't feel like ripping apparent continuity issues: that's just too easy.<br/><br/>9.5 out of 10 the amount of points I'm taking off this movies score.<br/><br/>Honestly, It wasn't the worst movie ever, it just could have had so much more heart to it. I'll see it again soon though and re-judge then. For now I am leaving sad... and let down. (original posted @ wapeach.com)"

","After watching this movie you can tell the whole plot doesn't make sense, there are so many holes in this movie it makes crank 2 look good. All this movie was made for was to be pure entertainment and that it. This film is nothing like the first 3 terminator films, it is more of the complete opposite, in the first 3 films all the action scenes seemed slightly plausible, but after you watch this movie you will have yourself saying ""commonm, thats impossible. Im not saying this is a bad film, i actually enjoyed it but you must totally disregard every realm of reality left in this world, so if your a fan of the crank series then you'll love it, if not don't go near it!"
"chalker23@hotmail.com","8","4","7","26 May 2009"," Good but not great!
","First of all if anyone was expecting the newest installment of the Terminator franchise to come close or even exceed the the greatness that was T2, well those expectations would be very unrealistic. I mean T2 had the original terminator in Arnold, had one of the best in the business behind the camera in James Cameron. Now even though Arnold was around for the 3rd installment, I think everyone can agree that it was the worst of all the films in the franchise. From what I have read onlineand in the papers reviews have been decidedly mixed about this newest movie. I am here to tell you that while it is not in the same class as the first two films, it is head and shoulders above the 3rd film. McG did a pretty good job on the whole with the film, especially with the action scenes which were fantastic. Right from the get go I was thrown into this world and it grabbed ahold and never let go. I cannot wait to see where they go with this franchise because as far as I can tell the sky is the limit. Well done to everyone involved!"
"StaticEngine","7","4","7","24 May 2009"," Another Terminator, Another Summer Movie
","With the general panning that the critics gave to this film, I went in with low expectations. Perhaps thats why I was pleasantly surprised, or at least, solidly entertained.<br/><br/>If you're a fan of the series, and you ever had a conversation with your friends after one of the previous three movies that went along the lines of ""why don't they just make a movie about the future war? It'll be awesome!"", then this is the movie you've been waiting for. Unfortunately, unless you have an extremely limited imagination, it doesn't look as cool as you pictured it in your mind. Yes, the future war is full of explodey stuff, and lots of it. And yes, there are robots hunting down humans all over the place. But somehow it's more... stark than I thought it would be.<br/><br/>This isn't a ""thinky"" movie, it's not like the recently canceled TV series, where it deeply explored the relationship between machine and man, the concept of the soul, the potential for friendship and hatred between sentient beings of all sorts. The reference to ""what it means to be human"" in this movie feels mildly tacked on, like a high school war fantasy essay that had to be rehashed because the English teacher said it lacked heart, and the student took the advice too literally.<br/><br/>Still, it's not a bad movie. It's well shot, well acted (if you call what Michael Ironside does ""acting"", that is. I kid, I've loved him since Spacehunter and V.), and man is it loud. The soundscape in this film is a character in itself. There are some in-jokes and good references, the effects are pretty good. Of course, there are some giant plot holes and questions you'll be asking after the movie if you think about it too much (what blood type are Terminators? Are they the Universal Donor?), so don't. Just sit back and enjoy.<br/><br/>What it comes down to is another film in a series that is probably played out, but delivers what everyone has wanted to see on screen for two hours. It's a roller-coaster of action, a summer movie to enjoy by the seat of your pants instead of with your intellect. It's good escapist fun, but if you're looking for a statement on the will to survive, or a serious metaphysical examination of humanity, then you should probably rewatch one of the previous films in the series."
"cartastic","8","4","7","24 May 2009"," Way below expectations but fun
","Well, if somebody asked me how did i like the movie I'd tell them I got disappointed because none of the ""revelations"" proved to be really moving (neither the history of Marcus, nor new facts on Skynet's creation) but on the other hand it's a nice contribution to the Terminator realm. Still, in its exquisiteness its closer to part 3 than 2 or 1. The main value that this movie presents lays mainly in the presentation of the postnuclear world. Obviously, Skynet's new gadgets have been introduced and they're rather interesting, though gaudy in some respects. The moment we learn Marcus is one of them our appetite increases immensely. Unfortunately, it only starts good to become really cheesy later on."
"TJ1380","8","4","7","23 May 2009"," Better than I expected
","I will admit that I wasn't expecting much from this movie. After the jokey ""Terminator 3"" I figured the best days of this franchise were long gone. Still, I decided to give this movie a chance since it was telling a story that I have wanted to see since I saw the first ""Terminator"" film, and I'm glad that I did. It's not perfect, and it certainly isn't as good as the first two films in the series, but it still manages to be an entertaining sci-fi action movie.<br/><br/>The thing that really made this movie work for me was the setting. We finally get to see the war against the machines as it was foretold way back in the first ""Terminator,"" and it doesn't disappoint. The movie does a great job at showing this hellish new world in which humanity is forced to live in city ruins and dusty wastelands in which they can be attacked at practically any time by nearly indestructible machines. It's bleak, grim, and absolutely the last place anybody would want to live. The war seems almost hopeless, and if not for the promises made by a possibly crazy woman via old cassette tapes that her son is destined to lead humanity to victory I would imagine that everyone would just give up the fight. The action scenes are effective as well. For the most part they look like battle scenes from old war movies, except the combatants on one side are futuristic unmanned tanks and metallic skeletons. It's simple, but it works because it's easy to follow and still manages to be very exciting. They do tend to occasionally go a little over-the-top towards the end, but since it's a sci-fi film about humanity fighting against killer androids it never feels out of place.<br/><br/>I guess the only thing in this movie that didn't quite work for me is that the acting is kind of hit and miss. While I thought Sam Worthington was good as Marcus Wright (the real star of the film, who plays a role in the story that I don't want to spoil here) and Anton Yelchin's portrayal of a teenage Kyle Reese was pretty spot-on, I didn't always buy Christian Bale as John Connor. There were times when I took his demeanor to be that of a haunted, shell-shocked soldier who presses on only because he knows that it's his destiny to do so, but there were also times when he just came off as an actor sleepwalking through a role. He's supposed to be a messianic hero, and although I like the idea of the legendary status of a hero being exaggerated for the sake of drama, Bale just comes off as stiff, humorless, and boring. It's really a shame since I like Bale, and I was really excited about seeing him in this role. Bryce Dallas Howard is another actress that I usually like, but she's wasted here; she seriously isn't given one solid scene as Connor's pregnant wife. I tended to forget she was even in this movie at times.<br/><br/>Aside from a rather boring savior of humanity, ""Terminator: Salvation"" is still a pretty good sci-fi action film. It's not the greatest film in the series, but it has a decidedly different feel from the other films that makes it worthwhile."

","Many complaints that have piled up so far are about this installment of Terminator not feeling like a ""Terminator"" movie. It is indeed very different. But this is a sort of reboot for the franchise. I almost wish they would have done this kind of movie for Star Wars. The picture is moving on (and ironically in the same sense, moving back because of the whole ""sending robots to the past"" thing). This is one of the best movies that I've seen in a long time. As a fan of the franchise, I was very scared that it would be disappointing and lack any content. But the story is pretty good and the action is top notch. I also appreciated the fact that they picked actors that could actually act. This really is a good piece of film making that is expanding on the Terminator universe. The action is so relentless and constant that I starting feeling tired and welcomed the dramatic scenes to calm down. Christian Bale was intense, Sam Worthington was extremely cool, and the rest of the cast performed decent or better. I look forward to seeing the sequel."
"sparej92","9","4","7","23 May 2009"," One of the best movies ever made
","I've loved the Terminator franchise since i was a little kid. I use to have to sneak an watch it b/c my parents wouldn't let me. This is One of the best movies ever made, it's definitely going to beat out T3 and most likely The Original Terminator, but beating what John did with T2 will be hard, thats one of my favorite movies ever made,but Terminator Salvation was great. I went to this movie with high expectations and I was pleased with what McG did. Ya he's not John Cameron, but he's gonna give him a run for his money. I really hope that McG makes more Terminators. When I went to The Dark Knight last summer and saw that preview it blew me away, i watched it a lot, it was amazing. My favorite preview was the one with the song ""The Day The Whole World Went Away"" by Nine Inch Nails, it fit so well. People can say what they want about McG he picks great music. I loved The O.C. b/c there was always amazing music that was fresh and new, not the same rehashed thing that we get. The movie was done amazing, the graphics blew me away. It's gonna challenge Bay's Tranformers,which i also like, I don't get why people can't like both. Transformers isn't trying to be Terminator and vice versa. There two movies that are going to be highlights of the summer. The movie, in my opinion, was split into 3 stories, John Connors, Kyle Reese, and Marcus Wright. As I was watching it seemed like the movie was based more around Kyle and Marcus. Which is OK b/c when you think about it John Wasn't in The Terminator,it was Kyle Reese,the kid they got for Kyle is a really good actor and fun to watch b/c he's learning everything now, not knowing how important he is. This is my own personal opinion,I think in the previews they shouldn't have shown anything about Marcus being a Machine. Thats what they did in the Dark Knight there was nothing about Two Face in any preview so you got a surprise when you watched the movie. That would have been even better in this, watching the movie and trying to figure out what happened to this guy Marcus and finding out he's a hybrid of machine and man. This was one of the best movies ever made an i really want McG to make some more. I think everyone will like the bit towards the end with who Connor fights and gets his Scars from<br/><br/>I'm giving this movie a 9 out of 10"

","I keep hearing about the loss of what made the other films great. Well to me T3 was recycled garbage with no style and no excitement. And my fondest moments of T2 are the best action sequences in film history, the heart pounding suspense of the action scenes are what made that film great along with good humor. It was never really the story telling that made it classic even though it was good. If you believe it was you are lieing to your self. MCG does mess up somethings like the intro, but not the action. This is the best pure action movie in awhile. Many better action movies but not as dazzling in action sequences as this. Iron man on pure action left more to be desired and Dark knight is magnificent but still a little to grounded.<br/><br/>This movie is the first since Transformers in which the action had me stunned. Not to mention the style is back. From the wasteland to Skynet the production is magnificent. Especially the last fight scene in Skynet with the T-800 (the colors and look are beautifully reminiscent of the steel mill from T2). Bottom line is that I critique movies very tough. But with all the great reminiscent moments and dazzling effects I don't see how this movie is being torn apart by reviews like it is. X-men Orgings was a mess and was a disgrace to X2. How is this movie in that same league I don't get it. There have been worse movies than how this is getting attacked. Bottom line is I love T2 and am proud to say this was a good movie of which I had a great time viewing and look forward to the sequels. Other than what I think the critiques can all go to hell.

","I loved Terminator one and two, I was disappointed in three but it still did not ruin the series. Now we are on the fourth movie Terminator Salvation, I've been hearing a lot of bad on this movie but being a terminator fan, I was going to go anyway. It begins and we see Marcus in the present and that begins his story. Then we move ahead a few years and we see John Conner, he's in a battle and it's loud and a lot of explosions. We get to see a hint at the old model and it reveals that John is not the leader in fact he is not even aloud to know what is fully going on. After that Marcus appears and finds the city in ruins, he is confused and by this we get to hear the characters talk about what happened.<br/><br/>From here we get to see the T-600 and Kyle Reese, Marcus is rather cold towards him at first but he is pretty confused about what is going on. The T-600 being a terminator it can't fail to empress. They are a lot like the T-800 but ratty and big. Eventually John gets to talk to the commanders and the plot gets set up from here. It follows the pattern of the Terminator movies, a big battle or fight then to some peace and then a big fight and then another peace. All leading to the big fight and some surprise that are shocking, Christian Bale does well as a colder John Conner than I would like but Sam Worthington steals the show with Marcus. We get to see some of the old terminators from the first movie and all kinds of new non-humanoid Terminators but sometimes I feel that the T-600, the new endo-skeleton deserved a bit more of action than motorcycle terminators.<br/><br/>I hear there is too many explosions and not enough plot but for a war based movie it works, like the old terminators a plot point, a battle a plot point a battle. I think John and his wife Kate should have spoken more and you have to look close to notice she's pregnant. The new ending since they changed it works well with what they set up and it flows well. I wish it had ended otherwise but that's just me. It's true these movies could have been more plot and less explosions but it has as much plot as the first. This is a good movie maybe one of my favorites but to even say it's close or not as good as three is a lie. This is a good movie and while I'd more skeletons matching at the humans gunning each other down and then a bit more plot on Conner but what this movie does right is Marcus, not to say Bale did a bad job but Marcus is the show. 4/5"
"RCWjr","7","4","7","21 May 2009"," Solid entry
","Across the board, this film left me with a lot more of a satisfied feeling at the end than T3 did. Where T3 seemed to be pointless, this actually carried the franchise to the next level.<br/><br/>Performances across the board are excellent. Probably the biggest surprise was Anton Yelchin as ""Reese"". I had reservation about his being able to pull off the classic character created by Michael Biehn. My fears were unfounded, Yelchin gives even more layer's to this familiar character. Howard, Bale, Wrothington, Bloodgood are all excellent. I thought Bryce Dallas Howard's portrayal of ""Kate Connor"" was a far more mature and grounded performance than Clair Danes from T3. Not to say Dane was bad, I just never believed her to be the wife of the future hope of mankind. Howard just seems to come off with more gravitas.<br/><br/>The story takes us into the first stages of the war, to the beginning of the T800's. The effects are the best of the franchise. A10's are used by the resistance and it is a very cool sight seeing them up against the HK's. The apocalyptic feel of the movie is great, it feels like I have always imagined it to be. What is very nice is how the resistance is basically pockets of humans who are brought together through Connor's radio messages. Most have never met him, yet they are ready to follow his every command.<br/><br/>There are check point items throughout the film that help to explain and setup the Terminator lore that we have come to know, like how Connor receives the scar on his face. We are even given the famous ""I'll be back"", now given from a different character you wouldn't expect, yet it comes off a lot more natural than the jokey way it was forced in T3.<br/><br/>Brad Friedl is still missed on the score front. Danny Elfman does a better job than Beltrami did in T3, but still, Friedl's scores stand as the benchmark of the series. On that note, Elfman has woven into the score the main themes from Friedl's score. This is a welcome addition compared to the pedestrian Beltrami score of T3. <br/><br/>The major flaw to me is not the film itself, but that they reveal too much in the trailers, especially about the Marcus character. It would have been nice if his big revelation was more of a surprise. If you have seen the promos then you pretty much know his big reveal.<br/><br/>I do not understand the complaints levied by critics who say the film is without a human/emotional element. I thought the film was right on par with the first two films in the emotion department. Yes, we meet several characters and don't have a lot of back-story, but the emotional context of what is going on is never lost and the end hits an emotional plateau that easily readies you for more."
"maxx_dan","7","4","7","21 May 2009"," Right up there with the first two.
","I cannot stress how surprised I was walking out of the theatre tonight. I am a fan of the series and have been watching them since I came out of mama, so I knew what I'd like about this movie and what I wouldn't. I went in with low expectations. I mean, come on, McG? Looking back at my time in the theatre, I realized that I was somewhat like a kid seeing (Transformers) for the first time: I realized I was *excited* watching the movie. McG comes through and doesn't make a rear end of himself, saving the franchise from the ruins left behind of the third installment. The story is arguably the best of the series, and I can say that with a straight face. The movie tosses you right into the action and never really focuses on the machines like 99% of movies would; the machines already exist in this world and are seen everyday by these people, so when you see that first turret shooting at the helicopters for the first time at the satellite station, you'll know what I mean when they don't really focus in on it; it's just there. And what a refreshing quality that is, too.<br/><br/>Sam Worthington overacts some of his parts (see the campfire scene with Bloodgood), but he could have been just as much of the lead in this film as Bale was. Common is never out of place or too flashy; he serves his purpose and that is it. And if there is one good thing about this film, it's no one really stands out in that ""need-to-be-in-frame"" way.<br/><br/>Splitting the film up into thirds would have been perfect, but god forbid an action movie actually try to be too artistic in its delivery. First third should have focused just on Worthington's adventures up to the point he is found for the first time by Bale's camp. Second arc should have been everything Bale's character went through up until they find Worthington's character, where then the stories merge and flow as they eventually do. Anyways, that's me nitpicking. Some parts of the story (especially towards the end) get a tad bit too dramatic and some progressions are a little too far fetched (as most action movies succumb to), but hey, what can I say - sequel in a year or two?<br/><br/>The sound was amazing (cannot stress that enough) and the effects were great, even though I would have preferred they didn't use so much effects on the Arnold Cyborg. MAKING a machine would have been much more realistic visually (DUH!). Speaking of cyborgs, I wasn't too thrilled that there were a million different types of machines out there, especially that big one. Don't go in expecting Saving Private Ryan, man vs. exoskeletons, though. The movie should have tacked on another ten-fifteen minutes worth of footage, as some scenes felt rushed, but as it stands, I was very happy with the film. Go see it and enjoy it; it's refreshing to see a good sequel and they are becoming extremely hard to come by. It's right up there with the first two but in a different way. And I never thought I'd say that."
"rammsteinerteen","10","7","15","28 May 2009"," Not exactly like the first Terminator films, but still provides a lot
","this film is great, it's not better then T1 and T2, but i'm pretty sure it's better then what the third one gave us, even though i actually pretty much liked that one, this film has story telling thats better then what people would say, the terminators in the film were not disappointing, except for the fact that they were much easier to kill then in the first film. And also,the terrifying image of the future show in the first film was a bit more disturbing then what Terminator Salvation had, and what i thought that disappointing that it was no longer rated r like the first three films and now it was pg 13 just so they could get more money. But it's all forgiven and forgotten once you watch the film for yourself. Go spend your money on this film, or other great sci-fi films like Star Trek and X-Men Origins: Wolverine overall rating: 4.5/5"
"Quinoa1984","4","7","15","21 May 2009"," you are a soldier, now how about the soul?
","Terminator Salvation is what people looking for some a few gritty and nifty action scenes will salivate for. This is because McG takes this as his specialty; he came up through music videos and commercials, so his eye is on the visual, specifically effects and trying to get his look for the film to be (perhaps quite contradictorily in this case) super slick and super grimy. The only problem is he leaves his actors fending for themselves. The plot is tended to up to a point, though it's one that will only make sense to those who are familiar with the Terminator franchise. This is at best what the Wolverine aspired to and falled flat on its face trying to be; it's a fan-boy movie made for the fan-boys of *2009*, as opposed to any year like, say, the 80s and early 90s, with tons of cash to spare.<br/><br/>This may mean you'll have a difficult time explaining what the story is to someone who has limited knowledge of the chronology. It's set in the future in time-line, so it's a sequel, but it's also a prequel, sort of, since the film is about John Connor, defacto leader of the resistance against Skynet and the machines programmed to kill (almost) on sight, *and* about his father, Kyle Reese, as a slightly younger man (here played by double-duty young-role filler Anton Yelchin after his Chekov appearance in Star Trek two weeks ago). It's about, in a nutshell, how Connor has to contend with his battle with Skynet's robot army on top of the emergence of a more curious cyborg would-be threat: Marcus (Worthington), a man who submitted himself to some sort of ""test"" while in death row in 2003, and in exchange turns up in 2018 not knowing where he is but *thinking* he's still human when he very much isn't. It's past vs. future vs. past vs. present in a smoothie blender that will keep you trying to puzzle out certain things... if you think about them.<br/><br/>McG's film starts a little sluggish, actually, and for at least the first half everything feels and looks a little too re-cooked in the genre blender. Not just with in-jokes, although there's plenty of them, such as, young Reese: ""Come with me if you want to live""; Guns n Roses ""You Could be Mine"" popping up in a convenient moment; cameo from the original model 101 himself Schwarzenegger. There's also the little kid tagging along with Reese and Marcus as they venture along to seek out John Connor and quasi safe haven with the resistance (thankfully he doesn't talk, which may have been a worse move, but it's still a little irksome as the precocious tyke who seems to be a lucky charm when script needs), or the predictable lines and character moves when it comes to just simple dialog exchanges or methods of action. It's really only in the last third, when the stakes are raised and Marcus has to go back to Skynet to find out what the hell happened to him, with Connor tracking him and going it along to rescue the hundreds of prisoners Skynet's claimed for some reason or another, that it gets interesting.<br/><br/>If only, because, Worthington is such a pleasant find as a new leading male. As Marcus he compels more emotional response than any other actor in the film - Christian Bale included who, sadly, doesn't do a whole lot with what he's given as far as being a barely 2-dimensional ""Lead-machine"" - as the first character in the series to be a cyborg who we can sort of sympathize with, as a character given a second chance in a world that is about crushing them if at all possible (i.e. traveling back in time, Skynet's 100th attempt to stop the Connor family tree from spreading). I might almost want to rank the film on a higher plane if everything else around Worthington was just so... average. It's certainly a step up from the corniness of Rise of the Machines, aka TALK TO THE HAND. But McG doesn't really step up to the bat except for delivering a few cool robots and some ragged action bits.<br/><br/>To be sure, there's some fun to be has as a *summer blockbuster* with some cleverly shot chases and fights, and as a fan it's hard not to get wrapped up in a mano-a-machino match as the climax between Connor and his former nemesis in skeleton form. As a dark sci-fi spectacle of A- budget proportions on a B-movie story scale it's not bad at all. But as with Rise of the Machines the problem, at least for me, is the lack of shelf-life. If the films James Cameron directed pop up on TV at any time of day I can stop and watch at least a few if not fifteen or twenty or the whole rest of minutes of running time that's left. They have a sustainable appeal as pieces of pop-art, of a strong story coupled with the action. For McG, it's all about the look, not the substance. We can leave Skynet for that."
"SamiCybertron","4","14","36","22 June 2009"," Cameron & Schwarzenegger how we miss thee...
","Well, I don't honestly know what to say about this film. I would like to start off though and say that I have huge respect for the Terminator series and that James Cameron made a cinematic masterpiece creating the first 2 with Arnold Schwarzenegger as the T-800...However.<br/><br/>After the third film kinda left a really bad impression on me I was geared for a 4th one...That was 2003, now fast forward 7 years later and we finally get a 4th Terminator film. Sadly it doesn't live up to its hype.<br/><br/>McG, Not Cameron is the director of the 4th film and his directing skills are kinda mediocre compared to Cameron and Salvation compared with Rise of the Machines kinda lost the feel that the first 2 films had, also films kinda place way too much in CGI effects and this film compared with the third film fell flat on there faces.<br/><br/>Casting wise isn't that bad, in the third film Nick Stahl played John Connor whereas now Christian Bale takes the role and he doesn't do a bad job but its abit difficult to say what I think about him in Terminator. Schwarzenegger only ever appears as just a facial appearance since he is now the Governor of California & all and too me its just not enough.<br/><br/>The action scenes are okay but a little over the top and kinda don't belong in the Terminator series and the plot I did think was abit halfarsed and was extremely slow.<br/><br/>Need I go on? Basically this isn't Terminator, this just feels and looks more like a generic action film with the characters from Terminator and all this hype that was built up for the 4th film and it doesn't have any feel that Cameron made for the first 2 in the series. Not even all the references in the series couldn't pull this series out of the ground anymore.<br/><br/>Terminator 1 & 2 were the best, 3 kinda fell flat and 4th was just a bomb. Save your money and don't see this film."
"tod2621","1","56","186","22 May 2009"," Run screaming from this train-wreck of a movie!!!!
","As a big fan of the first two Terminator movies I was very excited when I heard that an A-list actor like Christian Bale was involved with T4, especially after the terrible T3. I could not have been more disappointed. I don't even know where to begin to describe how just horrendously bad this movie is, if I was not out with my family, I would have walked out about a half hour into the show. The story sucked, the direction sucked, the acting sucked and the special effects sucked. The acting, Christian Bale cannot act, he sucked! He was just awful, which explains why he blew up at that guy who screwed up his scene, he knew he was on a sinking ship and had no way out. Good direction is so important, more important then the actor, because if you have a good director he makes the actor perform to his(the director) satisfaction, not the actors. All I can say is Bale was way off or he has always had good direction, which McG did not or could not provide. McG cannot direct, it was a complete mishmash of unintelligible dialog and less intelligent scene focus, one after another, like a bad video game cut scene. One impossible scenario to the next, one ridiculous scene followed by a an even more ridiculous one. The CGI and special effects were just awful, most are below B-flick quality, nothing looked real, the budget for this film was in the neighborhood of $200 million and I have no idea where it was spent because again, a bad video game cut scene has better special effects. I wanted it to be good, even after I had heard that it was going to be bad but this exceeded by a large margin my most hopeful wishes that it would be good."
"leighf1","1","5","10","2 December 2018"," Terrible movie
","This movie was terrible. No plot. No story. No real connection to the previous 3 movies. Avoid at all costs."
"Destroya32","1","5","10","23 July 2011"," A complete disgrace to the Terminator franchise.
","Let me start off by saying that I love the Terminator movies. The first one is defiantly my all-time favorite movie, Judement Day was fantastic, and I'm not completely in love with Rise of the Machines but I didn't think it was terrible (the major beef I had was that Nick Stahl didn't look like John Connor at all).<br/><br/>Now let's move on to Terminator Salvation.<br/><br/>1.) Physically Christian Bale can kind of pull off John Conner, however character-wise, he couldn't have been worse. He was stale, boring, and unlikeable. Totally the opposite of the past two Johns.<br/><br/>2.) Bryce Dallas Howard makes a terrible Kathrine Brewster. Enough said.<br/><br/>3.) That little girl, Star, was completely uncalled for. I don't see why they had to add a little kid who doesn't say anything follow Kyle around like a lost puppy.<br/><br/>4.) This movie did absolutely nothing for the Terminator plot line. The only two significant events that happened were John gaining control of TechCom and him meeting Kyle. Other than that, it's just another pointless action movie. If the movie was a stand-alone and had nothing to do with a series, then maybe it would've been decent but the fact that it's supposed to be a part of the Terminator made it disgraceful.<br/><br/>5.) There's absolutely NO character development. Everyone of the characters are cardboard and stale (with the exception of Kyle Reese which I'll get to later). Plus, you don't connect with any of them, which is something that I enjoy in a movie.<br/><br/>6.) McG is the director? Hello? He directed only one other movie: Charlie's Angles. Yeah, that terrible remake that completely flopped. Oh, and he made some music videos and Gap commercials. And yet he got to direct a movie in an outstanding franchise?<br/><br/>7.) It's plot hole paradise. I'm not going to even go through all of them but the major one is Skynet holding Reese hostage instead of killing him which, in turn, would've killed John too.<br/><br/>On the other hand, despite all the negative things that I have to say there is one thing that I was very pleased with, casting Anton Yelchin as Kyle Reese. I thought he did an amazing job playing Reese both physically and charaistically.<br/><br/>However, all-in-all, I still was sorely disappointed with Terminator Salvation."
"kitsune-kun","4","5","10","17 June 2009"," The end of an era
","Before I went to see the movie, I was so excited that I read almost every review I could find online. So, even though most of the reviews where tearing everything about this film apart and I went to see it anyway, with almost no expectation. The actual reason was, since I love the Terminator franchise (including the series yeah, I know) I wanted to see for myself, how bad it could actually be.<br/><br/>Well, I have to say, there is a lot wrong with this picture, but first I want to mention<br/><br/>Positive things about TS:<br/><br/>Sam Worthington as Marcus Wright was (in my opinion) absolutely fantastic. He transported the right emotions, played believable (as far as this is possible due to the stupid story) and was the popular figure of the movie and the only character, that came with a little depth.<br/><br/>Anton Yelchin as the young Kyle Reese was good. Not awesome, but better than I expected him to be. After seeing him on Star Trek, I just couldn't imagine, how he could portray what would ""later"" be the character played by Michael Biehn. But he did a decent job.<br/><br/>The picture itself comes along without shaky cam (THANK GOD). You could always see what was happening and, in that context, the effects were done well But nothing you have never seen before. This is actually where you can see, where all the money went. But that has also been mentioned a million times before.<br/><br/>The setting was great, post-apocalyptic as you would want it to be, but here as well nothing we have never seen in a movie before.<br/><br/>So, that was actually it for the positive things of the movie (again: in my opinion). Unfortunately there is nothing there, that would be necessary to make a movie great or ground breaking, which brings us to the <br/><br/>Negative things about TS :<br/><br/>Even though the setting is great, there is absolutely no atmosphere. Never did I feel like the movie pulled me in, which is also reasoned by the next point –<br/><br/>Uninteresting Story combined with huge plot holes. The story of rescuing a lot of people from Skynet base before it is wiped out is not great, but even worse is the fact, that Skynet holds Kyle Reese imprisoned, KNOWING who he is and what he will do if he survives! This is also, what disturbed me most. And nobody can tell me, Skynet let him live to decoy John Connor to the base to finish him off, since he would have just disappeared from the face of the earth when Reese is killed, remember?? Well, Skynet obviously didn't. Now, THAT was just absolutely plain stupid, but sadly not the only illogic moment in the movie there were plenty of those. Why can a Mototerminator (the motorbikes from the trailer) calculate the route of flying objects coming at them and figure out a way to avoid getting hit but does not ""see"" a fixed rope crossing the street, which is making it crash?? <br/><br/>Well, back to the movie itself.<br/><br/>The script is horrible. Written by the masterminds that brought us the groundbreaking ""Catwoman"" comes one more time a ""script"" that cannot possibly get any worse. The dialogs are a paramount in pointlessness. In hundreds of dumb one-liners, actually nothing is said instead you will feel ashamed for the actors on screen. <br/><br/>There is a lot more to come, so I will keep it short from regarding the following points:<br/><br/>Common played horrible as always – Bryce Dallas Howard as Kate Connor was a waste of screen time – Jadagrace as ""Star"" was a waste of screen time – The end of the movie was a PG-13-nightmare. <br/><br/>McG tried himself on something, that was about a million numbers too big for his directing-skills. He stole most of the ideas from other movies, not to mention the exhausting try of reminding us, that we actually watch a Terminator movie by referring to previous features every five minutes Well, I have to admit, without all the homages, I could have really forgotten that this is the sequel to T3 due to the lack of feeling and heart. Just sad.<br/><br/>OK. Now I will pull myself together for the final and absolutely worst thing about Terminator Salvation. Are you ready? OK let's go Here comes<br/><br/>Christian Bale. Whenever he showed up on screen, the movie became twice as worse (which I didn't expect to be possible). His, and this has been said before, nevertheless I'll say it again, one-dimensional, unappealing, flat, cold, batman-voiced, uninteresting version of John Connor is absolutely the least thing you would expect by an actor, who is as great as he usually is. I was stunned how bad he was. He had one face expression during the whole movie. Why didn't they cast Nick Cage? At least he has two expressions sad AND suffering.<br/><br/>This role absolutely ruined it for me. Of course there are plenty of other things making this a really frustrating experience, but I don't have the energy to focus on explaining all of it. <br/><br/>This is the end of an era that started of with an incredible T1 and ended with a so-so Terminator 3, was restarted and ended at the same time by an awful Terminator Salvation. I wasn't this disappointed by a sequel since Star Wars Episode I.<br/><br/>Now, there are two more sequels to come hopefully they learned by their mistakes. I have my fingers crossed.<br/><br/>Good night and good luck."
"chrisb_43-1","10","5","10","12 June 2009"," An excellent film, thought not as good as T1/T2
","The Terminator franchise is what got me interested in the movies in the first place. The first was a suspenseful cyberpunk thriller, and the second became my favourite movie of all time. The third fell short of intelligence but still solid nonetheless, and the TV series was a good addition to the franchise. Nearing the end of May, the fourth and latest film addition of the beloved sci-fi franchise will open, and viewers are in for a sheer summer spectacle.<br/><br/>I'd like to commend director Joseph McGinty Nichol, aka ""McG"", for really putting his heart and soul into the project from the moment he signed on. His direction is fluid and packed with emotion throughout. Granted, he DID direct the two MTV-like ""Charlie's Angels"" movies, but let's not forget he also directed the under-appreciated ""We Are Marshall"", which had top notch acting from the likes of Matthew McConaughey and Matthew Fox. This could be his best and biggest film yet.<br/><br/>Here, the overall acting is good and solid, with Christian Bale (again) giving a memorable performance as the heroic and disciplined John Connor. He is NOT the teen John Connor (Ed Furlong and Tom Dekker) and definitely not a hapless ""off-the-grid"" bum (Nick Stahl). He is a completely new, different, and better John Connor than before. Christian Bale is a terrific actor, in fact one of the very best of the new generation of actors, and he definitely puts heart into this role. I can't wait to see him in ""Public Enemies"". Sam Worthington plays Marcus. Is he human, or a machine? I can't reveal that, but his performance is great nonetheless. Really full of emotion, and it takes a lot of skill to balance the performances. Not to mention he has a killer physique! No wonder James Cameron picked him for his ""Avatar"". Bryce Howard is good as Connor's wife/second-in-command, and acts as a shield for Connor. Moon Bloodgood provides some eye candy, gets into some action, and manages to deliver a decent performance all at once. The rest of the cast, Anton Yelchin as Kyle Reese, and Helena Bonham Carter, Common, and Michael (surprise!) Ironside rounding out the above-average performances. And this just shows you don't need an action superstar to make a franchise movie successful. Speaking of which, there is a certain ""cameo"" for which I personally felt relieved.<br/><br/>The screenplay is well written, although it has few cheesy moments, but all is forgiven as most of the story and screenplay is written with so much detail that it literally is a Terminator movie unlike any other. Of course, with a script by T3 penners John Brancato and Michael Ferris, and an uncredited script polish by Jonathan Nolan (The Dark Knight, Memento) you just know that the screenplay is more than bang and cheese. The film is edited very nicely and lets you follows the action without a forced rush. The cinematography is gorgeously dark; it really puts you into the bleak and disturbing future. Add to that a lot (and I mean A LOT) of intense action sequences of which are mostly filmed real, complete with fantastically rendered CGI effects AND giant robots, that are pleasures to watch. Eye candy for the win. Speaking of robots (sorry, I meant CYBORGS), there's literally an army of different models of terminators here, and Terminator geeks will have a field day trying to guess which model is which. And of course, no Terminator film would be complete without Brad Fiedel's iconic theme, to which veteran film composer Danny Elfman truly does justice to, while making some glorious film music of his own.<br/><br/>In short, I had a fantastic time watching it, and definitely would be going back to see it again when it opens. Most of the Terminator fans would definitely NOT be disappointed with this installment, as it is chock-full of action, heavy on heroics, and breathtaking in scope. It will definitely have a long run at the movies, and will give Michael Bay a run for his money. (P.S. I know Transformers have bigger robots, but Terminator: Salvation has a better story) See it on the big screen where it belongs. It is a great movie altogether, not just a perfect summer blockbuster. James Cameron can rest easy, as this franchise shows no sign of slowing down.<br/><br/>Entertainment value: 10/10 Overall: 8/10"
"ayanami79","5","5","10","11 June 2009"," Total Disappointment
","Let me start by telling I was 8 when I first saw the Terminator from a German pirate copy. It really shocked my! It was thrilling, exciting and shocking, especially at the end, when the machine rose from the fire. I couldn't let my parents sleep for a week, as I had nightmares. :) The second part was also thrilling, exciting and shocking, but in a different way. Anyway, I loved them both, that's why I found the third part very disappointing. But the nature of the Terminator remain the same: kill the target. That's exactly what I missed here. They mixed everything! They have some parts where I had the feeling I was watching Transformers 2. Then this idea of human terminator... what?! How can a heart operate a machine?! Heart runs blood, but this machine had no blood at all! Maybe oil? If so, how could they give this heart to John Connor?! Then this concept of time journey... It reminded me of the theory of chicken and egg. Which one was first? The story of 84, or really, John has to send Kyle back? Why Kyle? If they send Kyle back, than it has to be a totally different future, no matter what happens to Skynet. BTW, why was Kyle at the top of the blacklist of Skynet? What did he do? It was so confusing for me, seemed no sense. Nor in the attack of Skynet. Why didn't they ""terminated"" John and Kyle? They were both there. Instead, they fought with them a lot. Crazy. Finally they left the place without any problem. No terminators shooting them or anything. They might have had some refreshment drinks while taking off... ;)<br/><br/>Personally I had the feeling some guys just planned to earn some money using the old myth of Terminator created by James Cameron. The last two parts including this 4th one are lack of spirit. I just couldn't enjoy it. :( The main phrase here is ""everyone deserves a second chance"". Well, I would say this new version of Terminator DOES NOT! McG should make up their mind, I think. If it were only a simple crime movie, I would have enjoyed it, but as it was part of the Terminator series... Shame on them. :(<br/><br/>At least, I really appreciated the joke of the young Arnold Schwarzenegger... ;)"
"sukrutas","7","5","10","6 June 2009"," Terminator 4 is great; I guess 5 will more accurate.
","May name is Sukru, and I am a fan. Careful Fan. I have seen the salvation yesterday. Today was Saturday, I sit with my wife and watched the prequels, one by one.It took my 7 hours but it was Great. after that. I considered all everything about this movies. first of all I must tell all of them is great. and I can easily say they are the movies they defined 2000s years movie style. if Mr Cameron did not shot the T2 there would not have been any revenge of Fallen.. It is more than Star Wars.,<br/><br/>And I am someone who has seen all 4 movies. in 2 days. I suggest everybody going and seeing the first 3 and then see the salvation. and the 4th comes all more logical. I can assure you there is no plot hole.<br/><br/>First of all, you have to remember from the 2th which has changed the future a lot. and when in the second one. the JD has been postponed. and all the JD theory has changed.<br/><br/>1-sky-net did not attack Russia. 2. Russia did not attack USA. 3. Skynet has just Become a virus. A web (WWW) Hacks all PSTN, internet. so all Countries attacked it self. not a general Nuclear War. So the common thinking of ( I saw comments saying if there is nuclear blast how there is mutant or total recall effect.) let me tell you something. Resistance Comes around. 2010, not from beginning. and all the big cities has been Destroyed. so what about the rural areas. they have not been affected. so they are nuclear free zones. so look at Japan is atom bomb hit country. Despite the high population. Not everybody is affected . but in 20 Years they came up better. but for a while people could not use the land. I guess. We have to accept the theory the big cities has been visited by people after several years. so we understand salvation takes place 2017. so that is around after 15 years after JD. so this gives resistance to prepare and get themselves together. even you understand Connors was in a shelter which has supplies for years. so you can understand something this give around 10 years to built T600. so sky-net get organized. as it is all WWW ( Computer) so it needs hands ;the machines to built the machines. first they used humans that scared. so in 10 years. they are ready for complete destruction of humanity. and T2 it says 2 billion people died. so it means there are 4 billions left alive. .first Skynet Cleaned the area for its own Survival. People could not Go into the areas of nuclear Zones.as they are scared of nuclear pollution. so Skynet built its own infrastructure in human FReezones. So After 10 years. .sky-net started killing people.as Skynet became something like a government with an army. the war began. between Humans and machines. it is understood that. after all USA has been destroyed. of course Europe and Russia must have been destroyed.so the rest of the world which has less technology did not suspect sky-net. here john Connor comes out. he warned people. for example ;he told people T800 but some people do not believe in. so People are divided. so some of them thinks he is some kind of prophet as he tells things have not come to past yet.and things comes out True. and more people believed in ,so the story in Salvation makes great sense. Look at Jesus or Muhammed(AS) or Moses, not everybody believes in them so do not expect the future in Terminator would be more religious. so he could not be in the command first . so that makes sense ,too.<br/><br/>the rest is the story. but they were important for me.<br/><br/>so I have a story for the 5th.<br/><br/>1. Marcus wright survives. 2. as people brought fuel cell with them.they have re-generated his Body. 3.in the third T101 says being a spy. so there must be other T101S among resistance. 4 that explains the fact how the resistance brought the power in balance. 5. T 800 re-programmable. 6. as the T800 101 was familiar with people and used slang. that explains this a lot. 7. So with help of body of Marcus wright and himself. they have started re-programing the T800 101s. Resistance made a Cyber army to attack Skynet bases. 8. And the sky-net started bringing armies. 9.you will say why the Skynet keep sending T800 back . but your must understand. Skynet sent them once. This is the dilemma . sky-net could not solve. as the technology the people who built sky-net can understand only T800 technology. .you can consider T800 as the seed of Skynet. 10. As TX is the Terminator Terminator, TX kills other Terminators. as the T800s being used by Resistance.<br/><br/>11.so T5 will be fight of Marcus wright and john Connor to convert the T800. as they are most human style Terminators. and if they are re-formatted. via Skynet they are only Read-Format( PS; T3) they can learn. with the help of Marcus wright. he is the KEY. he will be the Key. 12. this is the reason why the streets were empty. 13. the resistance have not got an army yet. they were just hiding. for T6 ; for the the army to destroy The Skynet will be ready. all Computer networks and Pstn must be destroyed to get rid of the sky-net. and I guess resistance will have T800 Factory.<br/><br/>But Humans need only technology. that is all.<br/><br/>Now I am expecting an offer From MCG To write the rest of the Story. ;))) I guess this won't spoil the story. this will help people to understand. and I hate people who just do not consider this is very deep story. it has time travel inside my email."

","Terminator Salvation was a big disappointment. T1 and T2 were some of the greatest movies ever made. T3 was not as good as them but it was still terrific. But T.S. was horrible. Christian Bale does a terrible job as John Connor. I couldn't stomach the part where he copies Arnold's line, ""I'll Be Back."" Anton Yelchin does a terrible job as Kyle Reese. He was nothing like Kyle in T1. When he utters "" Come With Me if You Want To Live."" I burst out laughing. This movies plot is centered around a character named Marcus Wright, who is actually a pretty cool character, but is irrelevant to the series. The plot involves Reese and Wright escaping from the terminators in search of John Connor, and Connor and Wright fighting skynet. There are many plot holes. Judgement day is now not 2029. In the other movies it was stated that Reese was born in 2008. This movie says that the current time is 2018, so that means Reese is 10 years old, which he obviously isn't. This movie should have centered around depicting a realistic view of judgment day including all major cities getting bombed. It should have shown the resistance fighting at night rather than day against thousands of terminators, as depicted in T1,T2,and T3. Also it would have been cool if liquid terminators were shown. But no, nothing important was shown. Arnold's face looked terrible as A CGI onto another actors body. All of the terminators looked stupid. John Connors final battle with the T-800 was an awful scene. The writers could even think of a better ending scene,instead just copied the ending idea from the first. I don't even feel strong heroic feelings for John Connor in this movie. Edward Furlong and Nick Stahl both did way better jobs. Christian Bale is an arrogant jerk who does not deserve the part of John Connor.When Marcus gave his heart to John in the end I laughed. Bale took over the franchise and ruined it. He probably ran the whole set during filming. I wouldn't doubt after hearing his infamous rant video against the cinematographer. The only thing cool about this movie was the action scenes, such as the bridge scene and the chase scenes. Otherwise this movie was terrible. A complete waste. And don't get me wrong I am an avid fan of the first three films. I hope this franchise can be saved by a great sequel but I am doubtful because that McG dude is taking over for the next two terminator films and god knows how much worse he will make it after this. And another thing, they should have made this movie R. Thats the nature of the terminator films. So all in all I give this a 2/10 and god have mercy on this movie's soul."

","I have been waiting for a 4th Terminator film for six years, and I'm glad I finally got it! It had a great storyline, great actors, great special effects, and a great direction! In the year 2003, Marcus Wright is on death row and sign his body over to Skynet for medical research. 15 years later, John Connor is the leader of the Resistance against the machines. He finds out that he is on Skynet's hit list along with his father, Kyle Reese, who is a teenager. Marcus is back and meets Kyle and Star. They try to get to John Connor, but Kyle and Star are captured by a machine and taken prisoner. Marcus reaches John and his crew to tell him about Kyle. We soon find out that Marcus is a terminator who thinks he is human. Marcus helps John by going into the heart of Skynet's headquarters and disable its defenses so John can save Kyle Reese and the other prisoners. They must battle some tough Terminators in order to make it out alive. I highly recommend TERMINATOR SALVATION!!!"

","This movie it's pretty good, do not expect T1 or T2 but be ready to get a better sensation than T3. Definitely see this one on the big screen! The sounds and visual effects at times are almost overwhelming! Great CGI and visually the future world and war are very believable. The story for me was just OK - I felt that some emotions and character development seemed to happen too fast and there were a few cheesy parts I had to roll my eyes at. Without giving too much - one little character in particular I found quite tiresome. One of my favorite movies growing up was Terminator 2 and this one falls far short. I'd say its about on par with the original Terminator (without a doubt better than T3). See it in the theater and enjoy the action and special effects - that alone is enough to make it worth the price of admission!"

","If your looking for something like Terminator 2, to bring it back to the old school roots.....there is nothing here like that. It seems to me, that these so called ""blockbuster"" movies are just being pumped out as quickly as possible. With no consideration to past movies in the same series. There was no classic terminator suspense, and the storyline sucked. They didn't develop the characters, so you didn't care if someone lived or died. The acting was sub par, especially Christian Bale. Many things happening in this movie, were reminiscent of things that have happened in other movies.... No imagination. Overall if your a fan of the old Terminators, this one sucked. Disappointing."
"vailsy","5","5","10","21 May 2009"," What happened to the Phased Plasma Rifle in 40 Watt range?
","!!*LOTS OF SPOILERS*!! <br/><br/>Aside from the very cheap looking titles (absolutely terrible actually) the first third of this movie was really enjoyable but it then unfortunately flushes itself down the toilet <br/><br/>It's great right until the moment Connor is on Kyle Reese's tail, ready to test the disabling device on the harvester. I thought at this point they would save Reese and spend a large portion of the movie protecting him. Unfortunately after flying all the way to LA to investigate suspicious Terminator activity Connor changes his mind for no apparent reason and the movie just nose dived from there - just about the time in the movie where we get an awkward, unnecessary and crap fade out to black and when some super model with shady acting skills gets tangled up in a tree. For me the movie dies about there <br/><br/>The Terminators start off promising, with each type having a menacing sound associated with it but unfortunately the stickler is they seem completely unable to terminate anything (even with mini-guns) and seem to wander around in quite a disorganised fashion like Ronin, and resembling vagrants. A far cry from the shiny beasts we see in the flash backs, and with very low tech guns.. what ever happened to the 'Phased Plasma Rifle in 40 Watt Range'?? All those cool lasers they had in the flash backs?? No sign of them. Maybe because it's only 2018 and they haven't been invented yet..<br/><br/>The movie is also at least 30 minutes too short given all of the characters that we need to learn about. Reese for example, er the mute telepathic baby that he hangs out with ? <br/><br/>Bale performs a noble effort but maybe could lighten up a little. Leaders have to inspire people, keep morale high etc. I'd find Bale's Connor a tough person to follow personally. I like Bale but he should have seen the light, listened to his DP and broken out of character :). Couldn't resist it <br/><br/>Anyway John Connor's pretty talented. He strolls straight into Terminator central to save Reese who the Terminators decided not to Terminate yet.. maybe thinking they'd do it James Bond style with a laser between the legs <br/><br/>At one point Connor forages for jump leads to revive his mate. I had this image of Bale desperately trying to resuscitate the movie but alas unfortunately we already witnessed Bonham Carter doing her very best Max Headroom impression, and the Arnie/Hulk <br/><br/>Did I really see the word Sony appear at some point on a piece of Connor's equipment, lit up momentarily by an electric spark? Maybe not. Anyway Terminator Salvation definitely didn't hold my attention past 40 minutes. I had very high expectations of this movie but unfortunately left the theatre disappointed. I hope you like it better"
"Mihnea_aka_Pitbull","3","28","86","5 June 2009"," Transforminators
","Yes - they TERMINATED the series with: ""...3: Rise of the Machines"". What we see now is just a failed attempt to resuscitate the corpse.<br/><br/>First of all, they should read Rachel Ballon, Syd Field and Robert McKee. THIS IS NOT THE WAY TO BUILD UP A SEQUEL! Genres, franchises and series do have their rules: one should be original within the formula. But this rudimentary show departs completely the essence of the Terminator movies, floundering into a cheap blockbuster.<br/><br/>The script is stuffy and messy - devoid of the stark elegance of those created by James Cameron. Hard to follow (read: tiresome and boring), and full of logical flaws. Just imagine: in ""Terminator 1"", ""...2"" and ""...3"", the machines send back in time various cyber-assassins to kill either John Connor, or his mom. Now they have HIS DAD (still a teenager!) in the Skynet grip - and they let him live!) The cyborg coming from the past (so to speak) is from another story.<br/><br/>The huge machines (harvesters, motorminators, hydrobotos, hunters/killers - or what were their names) are from another story too: from ""Transformers"", friends and neighbors! Just enough to name this sad work ""Transforminators""! But the worst is the scene when the first T-800 comes to life... bearing, of course, Arnie's face - ripped off from some olden goldie and digitally patched-up here (just for a few instants, to ingloriously die about as many seconds later). Preposterous! Plainly ridiculous!"
"Ark-Flash","9","10","25","20 May 2009"," Welcome to the Salvation
","With the unmistakable collision of metal, the barrage of artillery and ordinance, the scorched temperature of engines, the burning stench of gasoline and rotting corpses, and the precisioned whirling of mechanized parts...the Machines have returned (cue Terminator Drums).<br/><br/>It is 2018 and the land lays waste from the nuclear toll of Judgment Day...mankind's legacy. But amidst these ruins are the hubs of Skynet assemblers and hunter killers vs. the pockets of Resistance tacticians and strategists. <br/><br/>The New Machines T800, Harvester, Aerstat, Hydrorobot, MotoTerminator and the familiar HK are varied in their capabilities and arsenal but all programmed towards the collection and eradication of humans. <br/><br/>On land, sea and air the Resistance is well armed with conventional weapons. Although they are seemingly fragmented and scattered, they are committed, organized and held together by the band-aid transmissions of Radio Free Resistance. Huddling around the warmth of burning drums and radio broadcasts, the freedom fighters listen to the messages of hope and guidance which strengthen their resolve.<br/><br/>Over the years we've endured the rambunctious growth of the juveniles Furlong and Stahl but now is the time of the prophet warrior. From the wired intensity of Christian Bale's performance as John Connor one can appreciate he's acting on an adrenaline edge, and just a hair trigger away from his infamous off-screen tirade. If Jackman's method of preparation was a cold shower, then Bale must have submerged in the ice of an adamantium pool (my bad). Nevertheless as the Leader of the Resistance, Bale/Connor preaches the anthem and might of the indomitable human spirit. <br/><br/>The secondary players hit their mark strong. On his quest towards the Resistance is the nomadic enigma Marcus Wright (Sam Worthington). Along the way he encounters a brash and young Kyle Reese (Anton Yelchin) of the LA Resistance Branch. Decent supporting performances also by Common, Bryce Dallas Howard, Helena Bonham Carter and Moon Bloodgood. But I could have done without Michael Ironside, like the 80s relic mad dog Richter, barking out his unheeded commands.<br/><br/>The action and chase sequences are frantic and visceral as the carnage ensues. The special effects of the unrelenting and menacing Terminators were amped up to both impress and frighten. We've all seen many action scenes of this genre before. But McG's culls the best together painted with a fresh coat of metallic vs. flesh, cold steel vs hope and desperation. His film respectfully pays dues to its iconic origins with familiar soundbites, albeit too cute, but the fans roared its approval. Since Cameron's groundbreaking T & T2, we have waited long to witness this story of the apocalyptic battleground for man's survival. <br/><br/>Kudos to McG, Bale and Co for finally delivering Salvation and this vision.<br/><br/>Note: IMO negative reviews compare too much with predecessors or genre bests. Surely The Road Warrior (great film) did not invent the car chase scene. Nevertheless Terminator Salvation faithfully supports the core franchise's arcing story and timeline."
"rich-mortimer","1","6","13","12 June 2009"," Shocker
","As a long time devotee of the Terminater genre, I found Terminator Salvation so bitterly disappointing that my wife and I walked out halfway through. Having skilfully avoided all reviews prior to entering the cinema so that I could form my own unfettered impression, it came as no surprise to later learn that a majority of people considered this film a turkey.<br/><br/>The storyline is so weak that not even mildly acceptable acting by Messrs Worthington and Bale can carry the film. In truth, it's more Mad Max than Terminator. If they make a T5 then maybe Steven Seagal or Mel Gibson should be considered... yes it has been reduced to that. Maybe the last hour (which I didn't see) would have recovered it, but I doubt it.<br/><br/>I echo many comments above that T3 and TS should never have been made, and it's a great shame that both Cameron and Arnie stood idly by (maybe smelling the cash) rather than stepping in to stop this abomination.<br/><br/>The TV series the Sarah Connor Chronicles was far better than this dross."
"nachtgeest","1","6","13","11 June 2009"," same story different day
","Yesterday was a rainy day and I saw Terminator Salvation was playing in our local cinema. It was entertaining enough to keep me in the cinema for 2 hours. TS contains a lot of action, which is one of its strong points.The CGI was overall quite good, however Arnie was in my opinion too plastic, but still OK, although I think with the current cinematic technologies it is possible to render a far more realistic model (see Unreal3). Aside of that, there were some things really bothered me, and made me wonder how the director and his multi-million investors failed to realize these obvious flaws in the script. This is the main reason why I am writing this article, not to tell how great the action was because we all can agree that it is sufficient.<br/><br/>First of all, I would like to tell you about how realistic the movie is. Try to imagine how the world would look like after a nuclear war, no cars, no water out of a tap. But yet it still seems that A-10 planes are able to fly all around the USA, even though they require an entire infrastructure of engineers to maintain them, gallons of gasoline to keep them flying, insane amounts of ammo and last but not least, fully operating military airfields all around the states. Wouldn't these be Skynet's priority targets? And how about the fact that A-10 is designed at the end of the sixties... sounds like free target practice for such high-tech AI controlled planes of Skynet you might think?<br/><br/>John is played by Christian Bale who thinks the whole movie is all about him. He fails to realize that the movie would be far better off without him; not only does he not fit in with image Sarah gets in T1 about ""the great leader"", his acting through-out the whole movie was utterly average and made me sick to my stomach. Like in all of all the characters he played, he plays a guy that has trouble holding his temper: storming into Skynet, risking his life and the faith of the future to save Kyle, although he could sent that cyborg guy with a whole platoon instead. Yeah, thats to expect from a second rang actor which has ruined more movies than tears Justin cried to make his river.<br/><br/>The holes in the plot grow bigger as the movie goes on: the incredible AI of Skynet that ""decided our fate in a microsecond"" fails to terminate Christian at its own ground. Me, a guy with an IQ below 100 figured out that by making a couple of these fusion cells go off would kill John and Kyle, allowing Skynet to win the war. The story goes on; Skynet, a supercomputer, did not take any measures against Markus may he riot once he finds out they turned him into a robot. Even their newest model (T-800) looks inferior to Mark which was made 15 years ago, which makes no sense...<br/><br/>Overall, this movie was a good action-fed movie if you have nothing else to do and you are looking for some brainless action then go watch it, although any steven seagal would fit more for this purpose. For any person more than 12 year old, don't waste your time at a movie like this. The Terminator franchise was finished after T2, keep it this way. Wanna-be directors should start in the sandbox instead of ruining great movies like this."
"vlefs","8","6","13","31 May 2009"," A film I desperately wanted but didn't expect to be good and rewarded my skepticism!
","Terminator Salvation has little in common with the other three films, of which T2 remains one of my all time favorites, T1 is still very watchable (the fight in the police station is just terrific), and T3 was exactly what I expected; not very good or relevant. When I heard that McG was directing, the guys who wrote T3 were writing this one, and that they had to beg Christian Bale to join the cast, I decided not to see it. Everything I heard just reinforced my decision, and Bale's tantrum didn't help things. Finally I read all the reviews that were written about it, and made my decision to take a gamble. I'd give McG a chance. I figured that Roger Ebert was probably right in calling it ""All action, all the time."" I agree with 95% of Ebert's reviews. And you know what? Every single negative review of this movie is wrong.<br/><br/>This is the best Terminator film ever made. It combined what worked so well with the other films, and added the missing piece to the story. The other three films had all established that man was destined to create Skynet, but that we had the ability to stop this. It was our inability to recognize the implications of our actions that pushed us closer to Judgment Day.<br/><br/>But the original three failed to establish that it was in fact Human Nature to do the right thing. That we were all in fact good, and we were merely reacting in fear to something that we did not understand.<br/><br/>This film corrects that mistake. It very effectively hammers home the point that the machines cannot possibly stop Humanity; they can kill, maim, destroy, threaten, seduce, manipulate, self-destruct; they will still fail. The more desperate they got, the more they strengthened the resistance's position.<br/><br/>They had tried to kill John Conner by killing his mother, and in effect helped her prepare him for the war; they tried to kill him when he was young, and demonstrated that their weapons could be used against them; they tried killing him and his wife, and proved the futility of trying to predict the future; in this film, they try to corrupt Human Nature to work against itself, and they only demonstrate that Human Nature is incorruptible.<br/><br/>This film, from start to finish, works. The music was criticized for being lame, but you see that they had kept it to a minimum to preserve the atmosphere of the conflict; it was criticized for being dark and bleak, but if it had not you would have been merely watching an action flick, instead of a story of survival; it was criticized for having too much action, but if it didn't, then there would have been no menace.<br/><br/>Instead of blaring music, McG relies on ambient sounds and faint musical cues to help set the mood. Instead of setting it in a familiar past, he sets it in an ugly future; this helps keeps you focused on what every scene is about. Instead of favoring exposition over dialogue, he throws machines at you at every plausible opportunity; he refuses to let you get comfortable by putting these people you care about in one perilous situation after another.<br/><br/>What was it that made me realize that McG knew what he was doing? Watch the first helicopter scene. John's refusal to obey orders saves his life, his attempt to save the people aboard the prison ship saves his life, and then he is attacked by a Terminator torso. The Terminator, rather than doing the cold, logical thing, and grab him somewhere on his body, preferably his throat, and squeeze until he dies, instead throws him away. Why? Because Skynet doesn't want to kill John Conner any more. It thinks that by toying with him, he will keep moving closer to what he wants to do. Which is to destroy Skynet. Skynet figured this out, and they sent him the key. Marcus Wright.<br/><br/>Marcus is the whole point of the story. He isn't a hero or a villain; he is a metaphor for Human Nature. No matter what happens to him in this film, he ultimately makes the right decision, and in doing so, redeems himself in his own eyes.<br/><br/>If you want to truly appreciate this film then follow these directions. Do exactly what I did, and you will come to the same realization that I had. Read 10-20 reviews, and then Roger Ebert's. Go see the movie.<br/><br/>If I am right, then cool. If I am wrong, please, tell me by commenting on what I am writing here.<br/><br/>Michael"

","Be careful, not to think I'm crazy for giving this movie a 10. I don't think it's worth a 10, not at all. It's about an 8, which is the general consensus, I guess, by the average. However, I put it as a 10 to offset at least one of the 0 scores. ....<br/><br/>So, about this movie. I adored the style of the film and how it was shot. It looked dirty throughout it's entirely, filled with browns while in the human plain, and metallic and cold in the Skynet scene. The expressions in the filming of humanity versus machine are artfully done. I admire the director and how he handled the shooting of this at times overpowering movie.<br/><br/>They used the stuff from the other Terminator movies well. Turned the classic stuff into dry humor, in a classy way.<br/><br/>I wish it would have emphasized the love between Connor and his wife a bit more.<br/><br/>The only part of the film that I REALLY did not like was the Skynet scene with Arnold's CG version; I could have done without that AND I think it would have made it a better movie, especially since it didn't do anything to actually serve the film in an honest way. It didn't move it forward plot wise, and there wasn't a conclusion to that particular scene. Just kind of a waste of the time line and plot. <br/><br/>I found Christian Bale to be the worst Batman in the history of the Batman franchise; even more wretched than even Clooney. I didn't expect much from his performance in this movie, and was surprised when I walked away from it. Surprised that he did such a good job for the character. <br/><br/>People will undoubtedly say that he was cold in this movie. And of course he was. Why? Because it's a cold, war hardened character he's playing. How would you feel if your mother were dead of cancer, your foster parents had been murdered, and you ultimately grew into a role you never wanted fighting a seemingly unending war against machines that couldn't be reasoned with? And it had gone on for... years?<br/><br/>Yeah, so... cold. Whatever. Good movie."

It's actually brilliant because they're is actually two protagonists and you see where John Connor, can't trust himself, but must place his trust in something and someone he's never trusted before. Terminator Salvation 4 has done something no other Terminator has done. Terminator 1 started the trend. Terminator 2 was box office. Terminator 3 was thrilling. Terminator 5 (Genysis) gave you the unique twist and turns that revamped for an entire new story line.<br/><br/>But Terminator 4. Terminator Salvation. Is the one that can make you cry.

","Terminator Salvation (2009) Review<br/><br/>It's a prequel/reboot of the Terminator franchise starring Christian Bale as John Connor. Bale is great in the role and gives more commitment than the previous actor who played him in T3. Anton Yelchin is a perfect casting choice for the young Kyle Reese and the film would have been a lot better if it focused on his story. Sam Worthington plays a hybrid human/cyborg and he does his best to carry the film but his character isn't really that interesting. <br/><br/>It is a good technical achievement in terms of visual and practical effects. The cinematography has a bleak post-apocalyptic look it. It takes the franchise into exciting new directions but it's squandered by dull one dimensional characters and often lazy writing. The ending feels rushed with a poorly rendered CGI cameo of Arnold that looks like it was taken straight out of PlayStation 2 video game. It isn't terrible it's actually quite enjoyable throughout and has some nice ideas but it's just full of flaws and a few too many plot-holes."
"Wuchakk","5","3","5","8 June 2011"," Action over substance
","The first couple Terminator films are easily two of the greatest sci-fi/action flicks in history. The problem with the third one, more than anything else, was that it was largely just more of the same; and you can only recycle the same plot so many times before it gets stale. This explains the filmmaker's decision to set this 2009 Fourth installment in the post-apocalyptic future where the machine-controlled Skynet is at war with the surviving humans, otherwise known as The Resistance. <br/><br/>A few characters from the previous films are featured: An older John Conner (Christian Bale), his dad -- Kyle Reese (Anton Yelchin) -- who's actually just a teenager here (such are the complexities of time travel) and the T-800 Schwarzenegger Terminator (CGI, of course). Beyond these we get some new characters, the best being Marcus Wright (Sam Worthington), followed by Blair Williams (Moon Bloodgood). Also on hand are Conner's babe Kate (Bryce Dallas Howard), a mute girl named Star and Helena Bonham Carter, who's somehow hooked up with Skynet. <br/><br/>On the surface everything is of the highest filmmaking caliber. The problem is there's not enough character development or intriguing respites. So what we end up with is a plot that's merely an excuse to string together a bunch of cool post-apocalyptic action sequences with people who are constantly grim, shouting and killing, people we neither know nor care about. It's like putting on an extreme metal cd that's full of hyper drumming, buzzsaw riffing & screeching/grunting vocals from beginning to end. It's simply too much. There are no valleys to contrast the over-the-top highs and so it cops a samey-sounding, dull vibe. In other words, the very energy and excitement meant to impress & move the consumer backfires due to extreme overkill. That's why they call it ""overKILL."" It's a curious thing but all too true. <br/><br/>Be that as it may, there are enough worthwhile elements to give the film a mediocre grade of ""C"" <br/><br/><ul><li>Marcus Wright is an intriguing protagonist who thinks there's no good in him until Blair informs him otherwise.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>At about the 45-minute mark there's a good campfire scene in the desert between Marcus and Blair sharing a warm moment in a world gone mad.

She also has better curves now that she's older. (Would I even be mentioning inconsequential stuff like this if the movie were engrossing?)</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>There are a some interesting ruminations about the nature of being a human and being a machine, or both. </li></ul><br/><br/>Bottom line: If you love action you'll get it here -- there are motorcycle-bots, fish-bots, giant-bots, flying-bots, Schwarzenegger-bots -- all trying to terminate the protagonists. Strangely none of the myriad action sequences rival the ultra-thrilling ones in the previous three films and it's difficult to discern why beyond the reasons already cited. <br/><br/>The first two films successfully captivate the viewer from the get-go and the suspense builds to avalanche proportions. Even the third installment accomplished this to a lesser degree, although the plot was old-hat by that point (2003); still, it was a decent entry. ""Terminator Salvation,"" on the other hand, fails to ever truly captivate and instead opts for wall-to-wall action, creating dull overkill. That's too bad, but it has it's moments; it's thankfully not as bad as ""The Mummy Returns"" in this regard. Not to mention it'll likely play better on repeat viewings in light of the convoluted plot. <br/><br/>The theatrical release runs 115 minutes and the director's cut 118 minutes. The film was shot in New Mexico. <br/><br/>Here's how I grade each of the Terminator outings: <br/><br/>T1: A+ <br/><br/>T2: A+ <br/><br/>T3: B+ <br/><br/>T4: C<br/><br/>T5: C+"

","I just finished watching this... and my first thought was ""if James Cameron were dead, he'd be spinning in his grave"" .. then I came on IMDb and the very first review I see is from some guy titled ""if James Cameron were dead, he's be spinning in his grave"" ...<br/><br/>The movie was OK, but suspiciously beginning to feel like a carbon copy of Terminator 2.<br/><br/>Then came the cgi Arnold Schwarzenegger.<br/><br/>And the movie turned into a steaming pile of dog feces.<br/><br/>What I'll never understand is how the producers and the studio thought this was going to fly. If it made money, then kudos to you. But you literally spat in the faces of any viewer who enjoys the Terminator series and in particular.. James Cameron.<br/><br/>Ironically.. I seriously think the film would have been good and credible if it wasn't desperately and blatantly trying to BE Terminator 2.<br/><br/>If I had an opportunity to be in the same room as anyone and everyone who was a part of making this film I would have one question....<br/><br/>Why?<br/><br/>This movie did not need the Terminator 2 rip off moments.. which there were a lot of."
"Floated2","5","3","5","17 September 2010"," Great visual effects but the story is lacking
","Terminator Salvation is all special effects and zero depth. Yes, the action looks great but if you want all effects and no depth done well, go see a Michael Bay film. I think fans will be ashamed of it and new fans will think it's mediocre. The script was just so horrendous, along with the acting and overall pacing of the film. What's worse is the characters have absolutely no depth, leading you to feel no emotion whatsoever for what happens to them. Christian Bale's character was really annoying and not cool at all. He did that deep voice but had no depth. Also in one scene he says ""Ill be back"" which I thought just wasn't right. Especially the way he did it. It just should not have been in the film. I though Sam Worthington's character (Marcus Wright) was done pretty well. He could have done a better acting job but it was alright.<br/><br/>It honestly felt like Transformers 2 (which is not a good thing). A lot of the scenes in the film and machines had a ton of similarities to Transformers characters; that and the fact that it felt like a bad Michael Bay film. It was just action scene after action scene. The story and plot were missing. Also the dialogue felt cheesy and clichéd."
"mjk280","5","3","5","20 December 2009"," A head scratcher
","I'm not sure how I feel about this one. T2 is one of my favorite movies I've ever seen, the original is solid and T3.....well it was okay but nothing special. I admit I haven't watched the previous films in a long while so I can't decide whether or not that's why this movie's logic was pretty fuzzy to me.<br/><br/>I thought the first 2/3 of the movie were pretty intriguing and had potential to deliver a nice bang at the end. One problem I had though was the insistence of putting a pretty big reveal IN THE PREVIEWS of the movie. We already knew Marcus Wright was a terminator before the film even starts rolling, and that hurts some. It really could have heightened everyone's attention span if it was revealed in the middle of the film as it should have been. It completely ruined some subtle (and not so subtle) hints that were sprinkled in throughout the first hour or so.<br/><br/>As the last half hour of the movie unfolded I just saw too many things I didn't care for to give this movie a high rating. Just forget trying to shoe horn Arnold into the movie if he's not going to be there in the flesh (no pun intended). So Marcus can just rip a chip out of his neck and automatically Skynet has no control over him???? Also, the fight at the end wasn't too great in my opinion. John Connor trying (successfully mind you) to resuscitate Marcus with two live wires was pretty ridiculous. There were also a few TOO many references to the previous films. <br/><br/>It doesn't really make sense for Marcus, as noble as it was, to give his heart to John Connor. He did give up his body to advance Skynet's research, but he had no way of knowing that and they could have found someone else easily if he didn't offer himself. He didn't do anything with bad intentions in the rest of the movie either, so it just felt like a cheap way to try and tug on the audiences heart strings.<br/><br/>Last two things: Sam Worthington was good as others have said but you have to admit it's complete BS that his English accent drifted in and out of his speech. Seriously that's just inexcusable. Also, I have a major beef with the Bale's monologue at the end suggesting a sequel. ""We will fight on"" or whatever. Uh, Skynet is destroyed. There's nothing else to fight for unless you're including the money of ignorant film-goers, but I know all too well that it's probably true."
"fallyhag","4","3","5","5 December 2009"," How did the creator approve this mess?
","Its been a long time since I have seen a movie this bad. But I will start on what I liked. I liked the camera movement. The way the camera followed the momentum of the action was engaging. and I also liked....oh no, that was it.<br/><br/>How on earth can the director resort to the Cliché Mad Max baron landscape and then end with the cliché factory scene? One minute the Terminators can hunt everything down and then the next you can make as much noise as you want.<br/><br/>The characters are so forgettable. The story is such a non-starter it is breath-taking. i constantly struggled to see how the creator gave permission for them to take this route with the story. You could easily watch this and make no connection with the original storyline. The only way they get around this is with a dumbed down narration of what is happening and why.<br/><br/>You constantly watch it questioning the rationale behind the story...which really makes no sense. At times I thought my DVD player had jumped coz the scenes were so badly stitched together. Then the scenes you do get are so cliché. the motorbike, the lorry chase, the venerable woman saved, the renegade group who don't want strangers, the pregnant other half, the kid that don't talk...blah...blah...blah... it really is nonsense.<br/><br/>So if I disconnect it from the Terminator saga is it a good film...oh hell no. Lots of non-sensible action with a severe lack of story that an adult would understand. The Playstation Nation will like it because little thought is required but the Terminator lovers will hate it because it simply breaks the formula that has made it so great.<br/><br/>Not recommended!"
"Instantdeath","4","3","5","26 November 2009"," The beginning of the end.....again?
","This post might be a bit late in the day, but I got the urge to write this post after walking to work and seeing the DVD advertisements plastered all over the City. The immediate picture that flew into my mind was ' Oh that's the film were Christian Bale lands a helicopter on a terminator and shoots it once in the head and it dies' as if Arnie would ever let that happen. <br/><br/>The point that I want to make here is that the Terminator Franchise is a good franchise, its an original Tech Noir 'no pun intended' idea, the first and second films were classics in their own Sci Fi rights. But, what comes with a big name franchise, in an era were film makers and studios are struggling to put out eye catching titles is that originals and sequels become prequels, watered down shadows of their former selves, the inconsistencies are frightening which lets the viewer down badly.<br/><br/>The most irritating parts of this film for me was the fact that John Connor manages to destroy a terminator by firing one shot at its head, I mean, c'mon! SKynet manages to create a proto-type with a human heart????? For the worlds largest and most calculating military computer, missing a design flaw that even my granny could have realised is just poor. And when Connor is listening to his mothers tapes from god knows how many years in the past, it looks like he's taking a self help pyschotheraphy course.<br/><br/>I think one of major plus sides was that Arnie did show up (albeit in CGI, still it was a nice touch).<br/><br/>In addition to my little irritations of this film, I also had to laugh at the terminator eels in the water ( Never thought Skynet was that elegantly creative ). The massive flying cargo plane with its very own Transformer. The high speed terminator bikes that have a extra 'go to 10 line' which programmes them to destroy anything playing Guns & Roses.<br/><br/>I think the overall picture is that nobody has actually moved the whole Terminator story forward in a great leap of faith. The same happened with the Alien, first to were great, then it really went down hill rather quickly. <br/><br/>What we have, is the franchise moving forward in really small baby steps, too small to make any story development ( i.e. Will Skynet win?) and to make this film more than just a crash bang CGI buy it on DVD release. Forgive me for bringing this up, but wasn't Terminator 3 meant to be the beginning of the end. It had the nuclear explosions and John Connor being led under ground by Arnie. So, does this mean that Salvation is a sequel to a prequel, so you could say its a sprequel?? Answers on a post card.<br/><br/>I think it left fans of Terminator, like myself, starring at the big screen after the end credits, pondering two things:<br/><br/>1. What just happened in that film? 2. Why?<br/><br/>Well, that's me had my say, and by that I mean I probably wont buy this on DVD.<br/><br/>C'mon guys at the Studios, have some balls and give us a film worthy of Mordor :)<br/><br/>Peace"

"MistAh_Justus","8","3","5","12 August 2009"," Bale Delivers...
","Being a fan of this series since as far back as I can remember, I've always been intrigued by the War itself when previously we've only been shown glimpses. When thinking about this war, I envision crazy explosions, city's torn down and the human race banding together to fight the machines. Thankfully, McG delivers just that as we're given many memorable action sequences that are truly intense. Not too familiar with his previous work so I never really understood why he gets bashed so much, but all I can judge him on is his work on this and I think he did an excellent job, even working with a bit of a shaky script.<br/><br/>Once again we follow John Connor (now played by Christian Bale) fighting to save humanity and lead the human race to victory. But this time Skynet has a hit list exposed and the only other person above him is his own father (the younger version of him). So John must save him but in trying to do so a bit of a power struggle takes place, which forces him to take things in to his own hands. Bale gives a great performance, he seemed quite focused and dedicated throughout. He has a great water scene where his helicopter crashes (for a 2nd time) and he must defend himself from these snake like machine predators.<br/><br/>Speaking of those, we're introduced to a plenty of new machines and Terminators. From giant destroyers which snatch people up and release motorcycle cyborgs equipped with machine guns to a one of a kind half man half machine Terminator. The movie's story and screen time actually focuses a lot on this one mentioned. Sam Worthington plays Marcus Wright, a convicted killer who is given the death sentence and dedicates his body to science, thus creating the half man half machine. This guy's performance really stands out and is right on par with Bale's. Both these guys get plenty of kick-ass action scenes which make it really hard not to root for them.<br/><br/>But there are parts of the resistance that are harder to root for. Like the beautiful Moon Bloodgood who plays Blair Williams, one of John Connor's soldiers and pilots. She basically has a love story with Marcus as she doesn't find out until late that he's a machine and she decides to go against John Connor's orders simply because she believes in the machine! Kind of weak, but it does lead to some more great explosions and what-not. Other weak players include Common and Bryce Dallas Howard, whose characters are underused and almost non-existent. The shift in separate character stories definitely affected some of the character development, even though everything does connect quite nicely in the end.<br/><br/>So our final battle takes place in the North headquarters of Skynet, where Kyle Reese (John's future/past teen father, played by Anton Yelchin) is being held captive. Also waiting there for John is CGI Arnold! Yes, his Terminator does make an appearance, doesn't deliver a single line but is involved in a major battle. Although, it wasn't much, I couldn't help but the love the fact that he was somewhat involved with yet another entry in the series, real nod to the fans. There's also a few others like John delivering Arnie's famous line ""I'll be Back"", and instead of robbing bank machines and riding dirt bikes, John hacks into the Skynet headquarters and rides terminator bikes.<br/><br/>I've enjoyed every entry in this series so far in each ones own unique way, and this one could easily be considered one of the best. It's non-stop action from start to finish, and that's just what it should be. It continues the story and connects things back to the original time-line, it's truly entertaining. My personal favorite is Judgement Day and most likely always will be, no other movie in this series will ever match just how epic that one is. Of course, Salvation ends leaving room open for another one, and I think one more could be great if given the right script. I'd love to see Bale return and finish this war, as John says so himself, ""we won this battle, but the war is yet to be won"". As long as they deliver another battle like this one, you can count me in...<br/><br/>8.5/10"
"aviran-2","7","3","5","12 August 2009"," Better than T3...
","I went to the film with modest expectations. I didn't think it would be anywhere as good as Terminator, or T2, but I hoped it would rise above the parody that was T3, and that it would be a decent action movie.<br/><br/>T4 was exactly that. It had a lot of issues, to be sure. The story was unfocused and split between John Connor, who would have been better off remaining a mysterious figure behind the scenes, and Marcus who should have been the main character. From what I've read, that was the initial idea for the film, but McG changed it to accommodate his star, which did nothing to improve the story.<br/><br/>To distance his film from T3 and Charlie's Angels, McG eschewed any trace of humor. I think that was a mistake. The touches of visual humor in T2 don't make the subject matter less serious but make the film more enjoyable. <br/><br/>There are quite a few cringe-worthy moments in T4: Marcus saving Bloodgood's character from bad men, and of course the time-honored and much-parodied Hollywood cliché of the bad guy revealing to the apparently defeated hero his/her/its evil plan in detail.<br/><br/>But even with all this, the film was watchable enough. Action scenes were well-done, and McG genuinely tried to bring it some emotion to the proceedings, although to a mixed result. The tone of the film was dark, as it should have been, and the 'factory' where captured humans were herded by the machines was truly sinister. Worthington and Yelchin were great, and Bloodgood was decent. Bale didn't have too much to work with, so he brought in a rather boring variety of angst to make a totally uncharismatic John Connor. Nick Stahl's John Connor looked ridiculous with his scar as the leader of resistance, and got overpowered by a vet (as in ""veterinarian"") but at least he was likable.<br/><br/>I'd grade this film between 6 and 7. Not something I'd rush to buy on DVD, but fun enough to go and see T5 if it gets made."
"commander_zero","8","3","5","15 July 2009"," Number Four Scores
","At last--a Terminator movie that's as well-thought-out as the original, without the tedious sentimentalizing of the second film or the redundant Schwarznegger character... oh no, not him again!... of the third. And in fact the brief T-800 cameo returns the Schwarznegger character to the nasty, vicious people-killer he should have stayed all along.<br/><br/>In this film there is a Terminator who is trapped in the classic conundrum, hovering between damnation and salvation and not able to reach either when he tries for it. One misses Clair Danes as Kate Connor, but the dynamics of the anguished Bale - Worthington - Bloodgood trio add the human depth that this techno-saga needs.<br/><br/>I understand that a host of writers contributed besides Brancato and Ferris... whoever you are, congratulations."
"pjdoughnut","8","3","5","4 July 2009"," Very enjoyable as long as you don't expect T2.
","As a massive Terminator fan I was really looking forward to this and I did end up really liking it, however it was nt for the reasons I expecting to.<br/><br/>I won t shy away from the fact that there were some things that I was disappointed with. Chiefly among those was Christian Bale as John Connor. I expected him to be awesome as usual, but i found him very disappointing for the most part being a shouty gravel voiced thug that seemed to have no relation to previous versions of John Connor. It seems as if McG was so desperate to get Bale on board it was more for the kudos he would bring to the part than a considered choice that he was the best man for the job. I really could not consider that this was the same John Connor as has previously been portrayed. One example is Connor s attitude towards the machines- which is just the same as everyone else- he thinks they are bad and should not be trusted without question. This is totally an about face on his own experience where he himself has formed relations with the Arnie terminator in T2 and T3. It just did nt feel right for the character. However one of my other concerns was how much he was sidelined doing the movie. In fact the biggest criticism I have of this movie was it had virtually no character development and the story while it got a little better towards the end, could have been better. The other big disappointment in a waywas that after all the talk of itbeing e reboot and it being a war film it seemed structure wise it was nt that different from the first two terminators. Despite the future setting I am still waiting for a proper full on battle scene between the terminators and the Humans. This was something i expected from this movie and never got. For all the talk of it being gritty and realistic there was only one sequence- the sequence with the Harvestor that resounded as such. I also think the certificate did t help, how can you make a war picture with a 12A certificate?<br/><br/>However as an action blockbuster I have to say it worked very well. The many action scenes managed to sway the attention away from the pretty patchy script. Structure wise as I said this was quite close to T2 there was a great chase sequence with a truck - although I appreciated the reversal from T2 - here we had a truck being chased by bikes rather than the other way round. I loved the newly evolved machines- the harvestor in particular was a stand out and definitely added something new to the action scenes. Of course I loved to the numerous references to the other Terminators- the best one of course being the famous Arnie cameo. This was without a doubt my favourite bit. I exected when I heard about it that it was going to look really bad but it was amazing. It was good because it was short with only a couple of shots of Arnie s face. The fact that this cameo was so brief was what made it so good, I m hoping for more with the next film.....<br/><br/>Although I mentioned how I was disappointed with Bale, I was pleasantly surprised by how good Worthington was, it seemed to me that this was his film more than Connors in a way and in actual fact I was glad about it. The other great surprise was of course Anton Yelchin as a Young Kyle Reese. Yelchin was great for the part he played in Star Trek but here he had much more to do and he succeeded admirably- you could believe he was a young Kyle Reese. <br/><br/>So overall this film was good. Yes there were plot holes but this was the same with the others as well. In fact plot holes abide in most blockbusters the trick is that the good ones distract you away from them . T2 and T1 do this admirably - Terminator Salvation manages to although not as successfully. It is not as good as their esteemed forebears but then again i don t believe it is trying to be. It is not trying to outdo the first two- it s aim in my mind was similar to Star Trek - to re energise a franchise that had become far too boring. This it achieved. I hope that for the sequel they improve on the flaws in this one, yet as it stands it is still one of the best summer movies around."

","Well, the trailers of the movie sounded as if the war against machines was going to ""end tonight"". But none of that happened. And if you dig a little further into the Terminator movies, nothing actually happened in T4. While T1 and T3 were defining moments in the war against machines - T1 resulted in the birth of the resistance while T3 resulted in John becoming the leader of the resistance - T2 and T4 are just movies with a lot of action. There are no defining moments in these two movies. And there are a lot of similarities too - T1 and T3 showcased Terminators with absolutely no heart while T2 and T4 showcases humane terminators. I do not know if these were intentionally done and the makers of T4 succeed only on this front. I think that a very strong director can alone handle T5. Otherwise, the plot might be lost!"

I was never expecting Arnold to appear. We all know without his appearance a terminator movie is all incomplete.

"uncle-mroowa","7","3","5","27 June 2009"," Good summer movie, but something you expect to be better
","I do not blame McG to making Terminator Salvation inferior to first two original Cameron flicks. This series was supposed to end after t2- it's one of those films, that don't really need sequels. After seeing ""Judgement day"" you feel fully satisfied. There was no need for t3, and there is no need for another Terminator trilogy either. Leave T-800 alone.<br/><br/>And there is no real point of making terminator movie, which action is placed in the future (in practically alternate time-line): everything, that was great in the original movies is crushed this way. Movie does not have this claustrophobic feeling that first T had, and I didn't saw any message that was present in the t2 - so over all, this movie was empty inside.<br/><br/>There are interesting action sequences, we have giant robots, which kinda look like they were taken from 1950' Japanese TV serial, and we have really cheesy dialogs. Christian Bale is making his Batman voice over the whole movie and by the time passes all you want to shut him up. It's that annoying. There are also those stupid references to T1 like ""I'll be back"" catchphrase, which should not be there.<br/><br/>By the way, I loved Arnold cameo. Every 30 seconds of it.

Am not a great fan of the franchise and neither did I remember much from the previous 2 versions - but TS entertained me nonstop for the 120 odd minutes I sat through the paid premiere.<br/><br/>Fast paced and never letting go, the movie was an absolute thriller, often reminding you of references to last year's action giant - The Dark Knight. <br/><br/>This movie has perhaps also given birth to a new breed of on screen role play - the forgotten protagonist - and there are few better at it than Christian Bale. In the Dark Knight, the movie was supposed to be about Batman (C.Bale) but ended up being about The Joker (H. Ledger). In TS again, John Connor plays but a mere shadow of Marcus Wright.

","This is not only good or bad. There are numerous problems with accepting this as part of the series, which is not to say that it is an impossible feat. One might expect this to be a big, dumb, loud action flick, and to an extent, that is accurate. What's noteworthy is that it isn't only that, and actually contains some rather interesting material. In several ways, this is genuinely an original plot for the franchise, and that hasn't particularly been seen since the first one. There are a few twists that are incredible, and very well thought out. It does have a couple of clichés and extremely predictable occurrences, too. The writing varies a lot, and sense is thrown out the window so many times that they must have hired workers to periodically tow it away, so there'd be room to keep doing so. The dialog ranges, and a bunch of lines feel like they came up with them to put them in the trailers. One thing that added to this was the credible and different personalities seen in the humans. This is sadly not all that emotionally involving, most of the time, but hey, there being any, and there is, is a humongous improvement on McG's directing. It is, at times, quite exciting and entertaining. The characters are a mixed bag. Anton Yelchin... I'm not sure what I think about how he did. The acting has excellent moments, definitely, they're just seldom. The yelling was as excessive as the utterly ridiculous amount and size of the explosions, and someone needs to sit down with Bale, look him straight in the eyes and explain to him to stop doing the gruff voice. It's neither Connor nor Batman. The whole thing is well-shot, and the special effects are, of course, impeccable. Quality of designs are nice. The future war is, of course, much too easily fought at times in this, and the unforgettable and nearly overpowering tension of those scenes in the 1984 film is not present in this for a single second. While this does try to establish a bleak and dark atmosphere and mood, it gets nowhere near the Terminator 1 and 2. There is language, moderate in tone and infrequent. The violence is not graphic or strong. I recommend this mainly to those looking for sci-fi fighting with a script that is occasionally pretty smart. Fans may want to consider if they really want to risk it. 7/10"
"archangelof7","9","3","5","14 June 2009"," My General Opinion (Definite Spoilers)
","I have to say that I don't like watching trailers (other than maybe a teaser) or reading reviews before I've watched a movie. I like going in without any preconceived notions (other than those imposed by the first movies in this case). Saying that, I would have to say that I liked this movie a great deal. I thought it was very loyal to the movies chronologically and contextually. I liked the visceral feel of it. It was a little creepy at moments. The T-600's were really cool and realistic looking. They had an almost steam punk-esquire feel to them at times. And Anton Yelchin was so good in his role that I didn't even realize that this was the kid that also plays Chekov in Star Trek until I was halfway through it.<br/><br/>Only a couple of things bothered me. The CGI was only a little off putting and only in a couple of scenes. Probably the biggest thing that bothered me was some of the tech. Like when Bale hacks the bike and uses a USB cable. This seemed a little far fetched and laughable to me in that I wouldn't have expected the robots to be that ""unversal"". You'd think that they would have changed the format of their connectors or be wireless entirely for frick's sake. Another part was when the little flying bot was uploading Kyle Reese's (Pieces, lol) face up to Skynet. This took way too long, even for satellite upload. Another was the use of the cruzer micro. There is no way I believe that one of those flimsy little plastic jump drives survived Judgement Day and then the subsequent 15 years and still look as new as it did. It would have been more believable if it had been the bare chip with the USB ending. I guess the filmmakers were trying to say that it was still pretty early in the game and show that the robots were still pretty connected to the human world. It get's complicated because we're already technologically getting past those kinds of things in the real world and it's only 2009. You would think that robots that are self aware could develop faster than that. But at the same time I think that chronologically, their world ended in 2003 and it seems like maybe even the robots would have a hard time innovating in the wake of all that occurred. It's hard to say.<br/><br/>I think the reason that the focus was put on Sam Worthington's character as opposed to Bale's was that this felt like the beginning of a line of sequels. They could afford to set the base of the story and make Conner a sort of side character, because a. we already know a lot about him and b. there are going to be more movies with him in them. The only problem I can see with sequels to this is that they would have to actually get Schwarzenegger and eventually also Robert Patrick involved in them. They would have to get Schwarzenegger to put aside governor-hood (if he's still governor by then) for a little while and buff up or maybe to come in and do voice work with CGI.<br/><br/>Several times I thought to myself that the humans seemed to be way more organized and to have way more resources than were implied by the first movies. This was set way early in the post-Judgement Day time line. Before even the T-800 line. We don't see the same landscape that was in the original film because it's further into the future. I can see (if handled properly)us getting to see the first three movies all over again but from the point of view of the future. I think the biggest thing I am afraid of here is some douche bag director/producers thinking it would be a great way to keep things fresh by changing what happened with what we already know has happened. Like sending something or someone else back during the time of the movies we've already seen. The only way I would be okay with drastic history changes is when and if they (believably and logically) possibly figure out how to avert Judgement Day itself. I know that according to Rise of the Machines Judgement Day has already happened but I think it could be done.<br/><br/>Filmmaker's always play with fire when making time travel a part of the story, and when you're extending and or expanding on an already established universe that is already based on time travel it get's even harder. My point is that now that they have started this whole ""seeing the story from the future's point of view"" thing, they are going to have to be real creative in order to avoid destroying the franchise. They may have bitten off more than they can chew. That is of course, if they decide to make more sequels at all, but I would bet on it."

","Terminator Salvation was the weakest Terminator film in the franchise. What's more weak was the John Connor's side of the story. While John was trying to act like a hero by ""saving"" all the prisoners caught by Skynet, you only can see him as just a selfish guy; he only wanted to save the prisoners just to save Kyle Reese and prevent his death. And towards the end of the film, John does NOT show neither character develop nor act of redemption. John's wife, Katherine Connor (fomerly Brewstar), played no importance to the film as well. The story of Marcus Wright is the savior to the film's story. Throughout the film, you can see Marcus as a very sympathetic character and his story is million times interesting than John's. Marcus and Blair's chemistry was really heart-filling. So having Marcus gone at the end can be really disappointing. Maybe supporting characters are more cooler than main characters nowadays...."
"peter_sham2003","6","3","5","9 June 2009"," Good film, not reaching the high standards expected of it (spoilers)
","James Cameron had skilfully left a lot of this war to my imagination in the previous films, setting the scene with brief sequences of brutal laser guns n' skulls future warfare, and dialogue from Kyle Reese in T1, who painted a picture of a cold, dark, nuclear winter, where every humans purpose was to survive and fight the ruthless machines. No time for relationships, no time for entertainment, just fighting in the hope the world would change into something better.<br/><br/>It was to my great surprise then, that Terminator Salvation opens in the daytime, sunlight galore, with many of the buildings somewhat intact (in an L.A. supposedly hit with multiple thermonuclear weapons - the kind that melted Linda Hamilton's flesh off from 5 miles away).<br/><br/>The film jumps pretty quickly into the action, and starting a trend that lasts the whole film, most of the character development of John Connor is done through intense action scenes. John is the head of a division of the human resistance, taking orders from a central government holed up in a nuclear submarine. That part of the story turns out to be quite interesting, and a plausible explanation for how John Connor is able to rise to overall leadership status without any formal military or political title from the past.<br/><br/>We are introduced to the second most important character, Marcus Wright in the opening scene of the film. Marcus, who from the very beginning (unless you're 12) is clearly a terminator, embodies the muddy boundary between intelligent machines and humans. As such, he is an attempt to redo the exact same thing Cameron did in T2, when John Connor befriends the T-800 sent to protect him. Of course, it is now 2018, and John hasn't hung around with any robot friends in a while. This may be why he has such a difficult time not nuking Marcus, and why the painful and cheesy ""you're not so bad after all"" decision lingers for half the film. The time taken to drag this along could perhaps be better spent removing anonymous Kate Connor's neural net processor, enabling her to express human emotion.<br/><br/>Probably the only character given a shot at possessing a personality by McG is Kyle Reese. Kyle is a teen in 2018, and sports the same mullet and trainers that he had in the first film. In fact the attempts to reference at least half of his behaviour to Terminator 1 are tiresome, sometimes resorting to straight in your face robbing of entire sentences from the script. Bad, but at least they try with Kyle; he shows glimpses of the born soldier we knew in T1. If John Connor hadn't played his favourite GnR tune to lure some motorbike terminators in his direction, you wouldn't recognise a shred of the cheeky, street-smart youth from T2.<br/><br/>This copy/paste trick isn't limited to people either; there are quite a few nuggets from the old films thrown in for fun. One that works is Marcus Wright surveying L.A. in the same manner and place that Arnie did in his very first scene. This rewards the avid Terminator fan while hinting at Marcus' background, and made me feel smart. One that doesn't work so well is John Connor's ""I'll be back"" line, which doesn't make sense in the context of this film, and was probably the worst line in the first Terminator anyway (why not just drive the car straight in there Arnie, no need to talk!). McG even goes as far as including a CGI Arnie in one of the final scenes. No thanks.<br/><br/>With the human interaction in the film being noticeably lacklustre (bear in mind I'm a huge Schwarzenegger fan, so I'm usually pretty resistant to spotting robotic dialogue), the entertainment has to be found in the visuals. Unfortunately, where in previous films (T3 fully forgotten at this stage), edge of the seat tension was created largely by the fear of what might happen, McG says no to suspense and unleashes and endless assault of action in your face. If you were being interrogated by McG and Cameron in Guantanamo, James would use Chinese water torture to slowly break you down to a blubbering mess, whereas McG would beat you about the head with a baseball bat, probably killing you before extracting any information. McG does not disappoint when it comes to massive explosions, and the action scenes are well put together, intricate and good looking. However that terrible/awesome feeling of ""He can't be stopped! Humanity's screwed!"" was not relived at any moment in this. Its just not scary when a T-800 meets his number one target, the death of whom is his sole reason to exist, and throws him across the room instead of pulling his heart straight out and stepping on it.<br/><br/>I was reasonably pleased with the overall storyline, and if you ignore the usual inconsistencies it kind of made sense. The overall plot never had to make sense in the Terminator series anyway, the time paradox made sure of that. Where this film needed accuracy however, was in the minor details. They had a touch screen in the middle of Skynet for example. Yes, a touch-screen, made so human fingers could easily interface with crucial systems. Why not make it difficult for John Connor and use an old-timey keyboard... and swap some of the keys around to really screw with his mind! Its possible to go on for hours with the little annoying mistakes. In T4 the errors are so widespread its clear that McG just didn't get T1 or T2.<br/><br/>Comparing this film to the first two was always going to be an extremely critical approach, but McG didn't get anywhere near a respectable effort. Very good action and a decent plot, but atrocious character development, countless small inaccuracies, poor visualisation of a potentially amazing world, and a general lack of class keep this from being the great redeemer it could have been."

Its solid and entertaining and it has some great ideas .It does get a bit matrix-like towards the end, but it jumps ship well before Revolutions begins.<br/><br/>The film doesn't waste time explaining anything, it just jumps right in. Perfect. Lets get on with it. We know the history now move on and lets see how we win the war (if we win the war) Christian Bale is good, we always knew that. Its also nice to see that John Connor is the bad-ass that we always wanted him to be, instead of the whimpering idiot that the T3 writers decided to create. The new character of Marcus Wright is interesting and Kyle Reese is pulled off brilliantly.<br/><br/>I cannot fault this film.<br/><br/>P.S As far as i am concerned the T3 movie doesn't really exist, its purpose serves only to show us that Judgement Day happened and that John Connor survived it. The rest has been deleted from my memory."

","first I start by saying I'm a huge fan of the whole franchise. BUT I'm just a fan, not a geek or nerd knowing every single (uselles)detail... <br/><br/>so i watched this movie trough the eyes of a fan, just hoping to see a nice Terminator film which 'understand' the atmosphere and all the cool things most of the NORMAL terminator fans appreciated in the previous films,...<br/><br/>after seeing some trailers i was very excited ,they certainly increased my expectations, but the evening before I went to the theater I read some reviews which caused a lot of doubts,downgraded my expectations heavily, as the where far from positive,...<br/><br/>BUT after seeing this film, I'm a very satisfied terminator fan,... is this the best movie I'v ever seen???? nope.<br/><br/>but if you just want to see a very entertaining terminator movie, I really can highly recommend it. and I guarantee you'll leave theaters with no regrets!<br/><br/>the apocalyptic world is very well created, the acting performances are more than acceptable, the atmosphere is very dark(like it should ,its a terminator film for god sake)the soundtrack feels very ""terminatorisch"":-) and the action, by moment virtually blows you out of your seat. and the story fits the previous movies perfectly. and they are a lot of 'little goofs' fans would really appreciate.<br/><br/>I absolutely do not understand the negativism. only if you never liked a terminator film then you'll probably not like this one. and if you are an ubergeek with no life you'll always find something which is not 100% correct.<br/><br/>for me it was absolutely one of the better cinema experiences lately. and again, if you're a fan you'll maybe not love it , but LIKE it at least :-) I'll remember I left the theater with a good feeling ,no regrets at all for an well invested 9 euro's"
"shaftfinder","5","3","5","4 June 2009"," Action = Good. Story = Nonsensical craziness
","The first half of this film is excellent. Tense, dramatic, involving, with some expertly-handled action sequences that will have you on the edge of your seat if you're inclined to move forwards inexplicably while excited. The dialogue is terrible, but since there's very little of it in the first half, it really doesn't interfere with the sheer spectacle of the thing. The sense of devastation and emptiness of the world after Judgement Day is well-portrayed, and the sets are excellent (in this part of the film), despite some criticisms I have read. I thought the cityscapes and hideouts shown are in keeping with the glimpses we saw of the future in the first film. There is even a real sense of hopelessness and awe at the relentless onslaught of the machines - as it should be.<br/><br/>Then it gets really bad, really quickly.<br/><br/>The main problem, for me, is the entire premise of the film once Kyle Reese has been captured. This is when two massive plot holes, so gaping that they absolutely engulf any reason or point in watching the film, become apparent. Firstly - how can the machines possibly know that Kyle Reese is John Connor's father? It's certainly not explained within the film, in any case. The film's events are all taking place years before Reese is sent back in time and has sex with Sarah Connor. So unless the machines can either see into the future, or they have bugged John Connor within the time-line of the film so that they can hear the tapes from Sarah Connor (and if so then why, if they're able to get close enough to him to bug him, didn't they wipe out him and the entire base there and then), or it simply says on John Connor's birth certificate that Reese is the father, records to which Skynet gain access (and so they make some huge leap of logic and decide that instead of the Kyle Reese from within the film's time-line just being someone called 'Kyle Reese', and that fact being purely a coincidence, that it MUST be because this man went back in time and impregnated John Connor's mother. And they deduce this despite the fact that, presumably in this point, Skynet hasn't invented the time travel method anyway).<br/><br/>The problem is, the plot holes don't end there. So - even if the machines DO know that Kyle Reese is John Connor's dad, by any of the (also logically problematic) means above, why don't they just kill him the minute they lay their sensors on him - thereby eradicating John Connor from existence altogether? And if the machines DON'T know that Kyle Reese is the father, why is he number one on the hit-list baring in mind he's just a civilian? And a teenager? And if the Marcus Wright character is an infiltration cyborg, programmed to believe he's human so as to come across convincingly real enough to get inside the resistance base, why do they not program in some command somewhere that takes over as soon as he's released, to kill everybody in there. That's what they all expected would happen. That's what should have happened once he was released. The fact that it didn't happen, and he still carries on unaware of his role until he gets to Skynet, makes no sense at all. These are machines, they think logically. Presumably they can ONLY think logically, and efficiently. But their plan is the most unnecessarily convoluted one imaginable, with infinite opportunities to carry out their main objectives (kill Kyle Reese and John Connor - even though they don't need to actually kill John Connor at all, just Reese, then Connor will cease to exist) at about a hundred points along the way, opportunities which they never take for no explained reason.<br/><br/>Yes, there were paradoxes in the first two films (I'm ignoring the third one as it just should never have even been), but these were not technically 'plot holes' so much as classic time travel conundrums which are entertaining concepts in themselves. At least you can understand the machine's reasoning in the first films. The problem with this one is that none of it makes any sense.<br/><br/>Also, the whole dialogue between General Ashdown and John Connor (pretty much any time they communicate but particularly at the point when Ashdown relieves Connor of his command) is surely the most hilariously bad ever written. It was also pretty funny the way everyone had to constantly refer to him as 'John Connor'. Almost NEVER John, not even 'Connor' (as you might expect given the military setting). Constantly 'John Connor'. Even the man himself calls himself by his whole name at every opportunity. Brilliant. And Christian Bale shouts VERY unnecessarily at any remote rise in emotion he experiences. He's not the most calm leader in the world. You'd be a nervous wreck under his command within a couple of days.<br/><br/>So first part good, last part bad - hence 5 out of 10."
"MissFrankenstein","7","3","5","3 June 2009"," Much better than expected. I watched it twice!
","I just got back from watching Terminator Salvation twice. Yes, it was actually good enough that I was willing to watch it again almost straight away.<br/><br/>I read a lot of the reviews and saw all the trailers before it came out, but the film still managed to surprise me a little bit. It did start a bit slow, but by the second half it really started to get good. I knew the special cameo was coming, but I enjoyed seeing exactly how they were going to work it in.<br/><br/>On the second viewing, I took the time to notice much more of the little nods towards the previous three films. There's just so many though - the vehicles used, the choreography of the fight scenes, the music, settings and dialogue. I think I'm going to have to see it a good few times more to catch them all. I think I'll be able to - watch it again, I mean. Lot of people don't seem too keen, but it was so much better than T3 and so much better than expected. Not as good as T1 or T2, but then, it was never going to be."
"Bjelke90","9","3","5","3 June 2009"," Very enjoyable movie that can stand on it's own
","I think that this movie, just coming back from seeing it at theatre here in Sweden, is a great fourth installment in a series and a pretty damn good action film on it's own. It has a really nice intro but lost speed a bit after 30 minutes or so, but it picks up before the one hour mark and keeps going real well. The ending twist is great and the last 30 minutes actually feel just as good as something from the first two movies. We all know that a CGI version of someone is in this movie, and it was executed very well. It totally made the film feel more like a Terminator movie. Christian Bale was great as John Connor and Sam Worthington was brilliant as Marcus, that character had some really nice twists in his story throughout the film. Helena Bonham Carter had a small, but powerful role as well as Michael Ironside. However, I felt T4 was too short, which supposedly is a good thing considering that it means that I'd like to see more. The thing though, is that so much is happening that it sometimes almost looses it's thread, which I think might not be a case with a longer cut.<br/><br/>All in all, a much more satisfied Terminator fan walking out the cinema than back in 2003. This a good movie and a worthy sequel to Terminator 1 and 2. Go see it, no matter what the bashers say."
"jdkraus","3","3","5","3 June 2009"," At least I saw it...
","Even though ""Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines"" was a bomb, I still had faith that Hollywood could resurrect the Terminator series into something great again. But when thirty minutes into the film, with a script that is mainly made up of the phrases ""big explosions"", ""futuristic car chases"", and ""machines attacking"" there's a problem. ""Terminator Salvation"" ran into the same issue that ""Quantum of Solace"" had, first-class special effects and action, but a poor script. <br/><br/>I personally did not like ""Terminator 3"", but I find that, that is a better film. It at least had a plot, not a great one, but it had one. Salvation just has one big action sequence after another. Hooray for the technical people, but boo for the scriptwriter. <br/><br/>Acting wise, the only actor who was at work was Sam Worthington. He's a good protagonist, one that could be cheered on, but he alone can't carry a film. Christian Bale, one busy actor with one success after another has led me to wonder how he even volunteered for this film. His acting, which he can be pretty good at, is over-dramatic and bland. It was also nice to see Michael Ironside in a film again, but for the few minutes he's on screen, he seemed bored, as did the other cast members. And I will point that I liked the Arnold cameo towards the end of the movie. <br/><br/>What ""Terminator 3"" did to the series is damage it. What ""Terminator Salvation"" did was pulverize it, but at least I saw it. My rating, a generous * out of ***."
"rd_millard","7","3","5","3 June 2009"," This movie can't be the same as the older ones? Why.
","I don't think this film has any spoilers but just to be safe.<br/><br/>This installment of the Terminator series had a lot going for and against it in my humble view. Most of the mythology means that John Connor's roll was mostly defined and the state of the world was also quite solidified too. I have seen copy that suggests that the world view presented is to take on the effects the older films had on the time-line. At least this gives some flexibility to the screenplay. <br/><br/>That said where i feel this film fell short was in character development for the supporting cast. Marcus Wright is presented as a death row inmate. This makes an audience member want to see this guy die and not come back. If he were a coma patient or something; anything that made me want to see him survive in some way that would have been the best fix to make this more successful. The introduction and time spent on this new character is what largely mucked up the plot development I feel. The film as it is seems to have a bit of an identity crisis as to who the lead actor is. The Lead was Marcus Wright and the Supporting actor (who also adds credibility to the plot) is John Connor. Is this how it should be... not in my view. John Connor and Kyle Reece should have been the mains because of the father issue and the death row inmate that had an unexplained bout of repentance I feel just needed to be more quickly defined and left as a supporting means to the end of saving Kyle. This is why the ""coma patient"" whose body is donated to science works best IMO.<br/><br/>Also there was loads of complaining that the Governator was poorly represented here. It wasn't a big leap of faith that the Arnold knock-off could just be an early attempt at the time travel experiments. Besides do you really want to see a sad attempt at passing off the current Arnold as a lookalike for his younger self that was sent back to start this whole mess off in the beginning? Not I that's for sure.<br/><br/>I feel that this movie is very well done and is of course going to have a different feel than the James Cameron films and it shouldn't be forced to be exactly the same. The creative license that that was taken with the story and the feel of the post apocalypse world were taken advantage for the better. If not for the muddy character development and some shortcomings in the direction of the principal actors this film stands as a decent if not good sequel in the Terminator line."
"marvelmanny","8","3","5","31 May 2009"," It had all the right parts, but no glue to hold it together.
","Christian Bale, Bryce Dallas Howard, Sam Worthington, and all those awesome robots, and McG's rough realistic directing seemed that this movie would be a surefire box office smash, but something was missing.<br/><br/>I mean you had Bale's awesome intensity, Howards innocent beauty, and Worthington's interesting character, and action nearly all the way through, so what was missing? It took me a while to figure this out, but when it comes down to it it just didn't have the magic.<br/><br/>I mean T1 and T2 were awesome. Epic is the word that comes to mind. And I liked the third one as well, though there are plenty that thought it was stupid. I actually found it quite enjoyable with the one on one fight scenes with the TX, and the beginning of the takeover of Skynet. That was all pretty neat. And oh not to mention the TX herself Kristanna Loken. Let's just say she was real easy on the eyes.<br/><br/>But let me get back to the movie at hand. I believe the film didn't work because the relationships between the main actors failed to pull it off. The first and most essential thing that this film needed was a passionate yet realistic relationship between Bales, and Howard's characters. I mean before I saw it I thought it would go great, but they just weren't into each other man! And that was lame.<br/><br/>The second was the relationship between Worthington's character and Bloodgood's. It had a lot of potential, but Bloodgood (although very beautiful) does not have the acting chops to make it work. And everyone is giving Worthington acclaim (don't get me wrong, he was good), but there was some scenes where he was just void, and it would of worked better if he showed some emotion. <br/><br/>And by the time the film is over and done, the first thing that came to my mind was, ""Oh."" When it should of been, ""Whoa.""<br/><br/>In short, what I mean by missing the magic means that it just didn't have the man- the person who is The Terminator. And that man and person is Arnold Schwarzanneger. A man who was walking out of the theater said it perfectly... <br/><br/>""It's just not the same without Arnie."" <br/><br/>And he was right, it's just isn't the same without him."
"debjyoti1981","7","3","5","30 May 2009"," Good Start.For A New Trilogy
","Yet again we see one more movie from the Terminator Franchise. Ever since the first Teaser Trailer for Salvation was launched, I had been excited for this movie. Recently there had been very big speculation with this particular Movie, especially by the Critics World. I was surprised to see this movie getting whacked so much by the critics at www.rottentomatoes.com I have seen this movie at last and I can say this Movie deserved much more than what it received at Rotten Tomatoes. There is no doubt Terminator 2: Judgment Day was the best among the series. But this movie was better than T3: Rise of Machines.<br/><br/>When McG signed up for this movie I had been apprehensive because honestly, I hated Charlie's Angels. Terminator Salvation is a new beginning, so we should not compare with its predecessor. There is no time travel and of course no mission for hunting down the members of the Connors. High point of this movie is its action; it has been a long time since I had seen action like this. Special Effects incorporated are top notch. As far as character development is concerned there are some places where certain elements are missing. Considering this as the start of the trilogy this can be forgiven. I hope this will be dealt with other upcoming series. Columnists have complained that Christian Bale was cold as John Connor. I can say that when the central character has been subjected to so many years of war, we can always expect to hope for less sentiment as that happens in today's reality. Terminator Salvation gyrates round the Character of Marcus Wright (Very well portrayed by Sam Worthington) & Kyle Reese (Anton Yelchin). This movie was meant to be action oriented so as to show us the apocalyptic world post judgment day. Apart from the stunning cinematography Danny Elfman's music gives us an edgy metallic score. <br/><br/>Since so many reviews have already given out the plot details of 'Salvation' I will not be writing it as it ruins the anticipation. Finished with that, closing notes will be every one should see this movie with an open mind rather than having a downbeat feeling for not having Arnold or 'Hasta la Vista, baby' <br/><br/>Note: Recently I heard that there might be some forty minutes of edited footage for the upcoming Terminator Salvation DVD. Expectantly it might give us some more details."

"moviesleuth2","7","3","5","29 May 2009"," A good follow-up
","When I heard that the new Terminator movie was rated PG-13 in stead of R like the rest of them, I lost faith in it (changing the rating for a sequel never works...remember the Whole Ten Yards? Or the Fantastic Four sequel?). Then I remembered how corrupt the MPAA is, especially when it comes to big budget action movies, so my hopes rose. The truth is that Terminator Salvation is really no more violent than the last two films (once again calling into question the dubious practices of the MPAA. If you're worried about the sequel being ""neutered"" to allow the teenage audience to see it, fear not. You'll get what you paid for.<br/><br/>That being said, ""Terminator Salvation"" is a good film despite the lower rating. There are moments of sheer suspense and a good few jump moments. That, and the story is actually pretty engaging. And, the acting is solid across the board as well.<br/><br/>Unlike the previous features in the ""Terminator"" franchise, ""Terminator Salvation"" takes place strictly in the future, after Judgement Day. The world has plunged into darkness and humanity is losing the war against the machines. John Connor (Christian Bale) is the head of the resistance, as the previous films foreshadowed. But there is another character that comes into play. That is Marcus Wright (Sam Worthington), an amnesiac who carries a dark secret that could change everything.<br/><br/>As promised, ""Terminator Salvation"" is darker and grittier than any of the previous installments. However, this is no ""Saving Private Ryan."" Director McG's goal is to create excitement in the audience, and the tone exists only to give the story an extra visceral punch. The visuals are desaturated to the point where everything is almost gray, yet again, ""depressing"" is not a word that anyone would use to describe the film.<br/><br/>The acting is solid across the board. Christian Bale gives a terrific intensity to John Connor, and while unlike either Edward Furlong or Nick Stahl, his performance works (I suppose anyone would act different in a post-apocalyptic war as opposed to the early 90's or 2000's). Newcomer Sam Worthington is clearly a hopeful A-lister to producers (he's already in James Cameron's upcoming sci-fi epic ""Avatar""), and if he keeps up the work that he does here, I'll be willing to bet that the producers' gamble will pay off. He very nearly steals the movie from Bale (though his character is more central to the story than Bale's). Moon Bloodgood, Bryce Dallas Howard (even though her talents are wasted here), Anton Yelchin, Michael Ironside, and, in what could charitably be called a cameo, Helena Bonham Carter, are solid as well.<br/><br/>The film's structure is similar to the previous films, but there are a few noticeable differences. Primarily, the film tells two stories at the same time: John Connor's and Marcus Wright's. Marcus's story is more compelling, and at least for the first hour, that's who the focus is on (Bale doesn't appear much during this time). These stories converge and intersect from time to time. They also shift focus between characters as the story requires. In another movie, this may seem like a flaw, but at least here, it works.<br/><br/>Despite the perceived limitations, I enjoyed this film, and I would definitely recommend it, especially if you're a fan of the franchise."

","I saw Terminator Salvation with my friends and we enjoyed the movie a lot. It was very entertaining, full of action and amazing graphics. I know it was in the sci-fi genre, but it was almost a horror film because there were many moments that caused me to jump from my seat. However, the movie also brings us deep questions about life and what it means to be human.<br/><br/>The primary narrative element of the movie comes from its ""atmosphere"". The story is set in 2018, a post-apocalyptic world devastated by nuclear war. It brings the audience into their world – one dominated by cold, ruthless machines.<br/><br/>The secondary narrative elements are the ""characters"" of John Connor and Marcus Wright. John is the leader of the Resistance movement that fights against the machines in order to preserve the human race. In one of the scenes John's superior commanded him to blow up Skynet. (Skynet is the control tower of the enemy base with all the machines but also with human captives.) John refuses to sacrifice the humans as collateral damage along with the machines. John believes that valuing life is what made humans different from the machines. John is a character who brings hope to the human race. As long as he is around, people feel that things are going to be alright. Marcus, on the other hand, is a hybrid of human and machine. In the year 2003, he committed crimes that resulted in his death sentence. Later on, he was turned into a machine but he didn't know it until later on when John revealed the fact to him. Marcus is a man struggling to find his identity. He then ""chooses"" to be a human and fights against the machines.<br/><br/>The title of this series Terminator ""Salvation"" and Terminator ""Judgment Day"" are biblical terms. It uses metaphors and symbols found in end-time narratives of the Bible. The name of John Connor (J.C.) most likely points to Jesus Christ (J.C.). Both these figures bring hope and salvation to the human race. Both of them gave their lives so that others may live. (HollywoodJesus.com lists many more parallels between Terminator and the Gospel story).<br/><br/>The big question in this movie is this: what makes a person ""human""? Is it a beating heart? Is it believing that you are human? Is it loving people around you? The central theme about life is that there is always a choice you can make. You can choose to resist evil, or not. You can choose to protect the people you love, or not. You can choose to be human, or not. You can choose to believe in God (or a higher purpose) and receive salvation, or not. Choose your path wisely."

","This is by far and away McG's best movie. But that isn't saying much. Charlie's Angels 1 and 2 were junk. We are Marshall was good but very manipulative.<br/><br/>This is a BIG movie. Great, seamless special effects. If producers had an ounce of brains amongst them they would have named this movie Terminators rather than Terminator Salvation horrible title and like Cameron taking over for Scott with Aliens. Also they would have ripped up the script and started over<br/><br/>I wanted to love this movie but I could only like it. The story, the writers did a horrible job. I've heard that Sam Worthington is the next big thing. Why? His performance is wooden, uninspired and lacking any type of charisma. For me, the scenes with Christian Bale work very well. He is John Connor. some people have complained that he is over acting. He's fighting for the freedom of the humanity. It's kind of a big deal. Bale holds the screen with incredible intensity.<br/><br/>The Marcus Wright plot with Worthington doesn't make any sense.<br/><br/>Plus Sam Worthington is not good in this movie. I think Cameron recommended Worthington to McG to sink the movie. I don't get people thinking he's the next star. Worthington's Australian accent slips out every once in a while through out the movie. Worthington shows no charisma or basically any acting ability. He's bland and boring. Bale's scenes had me riveted to the screen while I thought the Worthington scenes were boring and disconnected. I THINK THE Australian Hollywood MAFIA IS TRYING TO PUSH WORTHINGTON INTO BEING A STAR AND SAY HE STOLE T4 BUT HE'S IN FACT THE GUY WHO SUNK THE MOVIE. HE'S BORING! Arnold, Patrick and Loken as terminators all showed far more style and charisma than the stone faced Worthington.<br/><br/>SPOILERS - If Wright is a terminator why the heck doesn't he just kill Reese and Connor when he meets them. I can understand acting completely human with Blair and others. But why not have the programming kick in when he meets his targets. Makes no sense to send them back to skynet base. And in fact it's and accident that he sends reese back to skynet at all. Wright actually fights against sending reese back to skynet.<br/><br/>HOW THE HECK DOES SKYNET KNOW THAT REESE IS CONNOR'S FATHER! OR THAT CONNOR WILL EVEN BECOME THE LEADER OF THE RESISTANCE. SKYNET SENDS THE TERMINATORS BACK AT THE END OF THE WAR. THE TERMINATORS DON'T LIVE TO TELL SKYNET THAT REESE IS CONNOR'S FATHER. IN FACT NO ONE KNOWS THAT BESIDES SARA CONNOR! Makes zero sense.<br/><br/>The writers screenplay is terrible! WE FOLLOWED SARA CONNOR (T1), WE FOLLOWED SARA AND JOHN CONNOR (T2) AND THEN FOLLOWED JOHN CONNOR (T3).<br/><br/>WHY ARE WE NOW FOLLOWING SOME DUDE NAMED MARCUS WRIGHT. HE'S NOT WHERE THE STORY SHOULD CONCENTRATE. THANK GOD BALE CAME ALONG AND MADE THEM INCREASE THE ROLE OF JOHN CONNOR OR THIS MOVIE WOULD BE TOTAL CRAP! THE ORIGINAL WRITERS HAD NO IDEA WHAT THE HECK THEY WERE DOING. IF YOU HEARD ABOUT THE ORIGINAL ENDING, TAKING OF JOHN CONNORS FACE AND PUTTING IT ON WRIGHT. TOTALLY DUMB. THEY WOULD HAVE TAKEN ALL THE HUMANITY OUT OF THE SERIES! I love the terminator series. And this movie, though okay is still a major disappointment.<br/><br/>With all the problems of the movie. The first 2/3 is very entertaining but the ending is Connor fighting in the basement. It was great to see the Arnold T-800 but the ending isn't very big in scope and seemed jumpy and nowhere near awe inspiring<br/><br/>The Marcus escape scene was terrible. If the reistance can't kill one terminator on their own territory than how are they still alive. Also the attempted rape scene of Blair was awful. I've seen that exact same scene in 50 other bad movies. Horrible writing.<br/><br/>THe movie doesn't work because it needed to concentrate on John Connor not marcus wright. Big mistake. HUGE! Also the look of the movie was off. THe movie should have taken place at night. Reese in T1 says humans stay down by day and come out at night. In Terminator Salvation, he says the exact opposite. THe movie lacked the cool look of Cameron's future scenes. The look of the movie just didn't capture the world that I'd imagined for the last 25 to 18 years.<br/><br/>All that said, I still hope the movie does well enough that a sequel will be made. McG and special effects people did a good job. It needs vast improvement for the sequel but I'd still be interested in seeing it."
"axl2000","7","3","5","26 May 2009"," Better than T3, not as good as T1 or T2
","So...first of all I want to say that this is solid piece of action movie...and just that. We have fights, bullets, screams, explosions and so on. Very good CGI effects, great sound, nice Arnold CGI but we can see his face only for about 20 seconds. Script and story is good but McG forgot about that ""thing"" that makes people want to see movie again and again. And I think this is character development (maybe Director's Cut will help this). Bad acting from Bale and short dialogues - that's most irritating thing. Good actor made his character look silly. Some angry all the time guy screaming at people, looking like he's gonna make a poo in a second. He was just boring or even pathetic in some scenes. Sam - very good acting, very charismatic actor. Marcus character was way better than Connor, he stole this movie from John, and it's mostly about him. Taht is this kind of character that we want to know ""what's next with him?"" Editing was little chaotic, but not as chaotic as in T3, that's good news, can't say it was bad, but if we see a fight between T800 and John we want to see it all in one shot! ;) Oh and last fight - masterpiece in my opinion. John and Markus vs T800, nicely done. Some people say that ending is disappointing, but for me it was great, I felt like I was watching ending of T2, action, fight, winner, and than some sad moments (Marcus death...). Total runtime from beginning to the last scene - 106 minutes. Don't know why on IMDb it's 130m (Director's Cut?). Oh, and sorry for my English.<br/><br/>Action movie - 8/10 Terminator movie - 6/10 Overall - 7/10"

"boe_dye","9","3","5","24 May 2009"," boe_dye sez: Okay, I get why people didn't like it. here is why I did:
","First off, lets understand that this isn't really the ""finality"" of Terminator. It's more on the order of this is a story how we get from point A which would be sometime after Terminator 3, to point B which would be before the war is over. In all honesty there is a considerable amount of groundwork to cover between here and there which, thankfully, McG did not choose to cover.<br/><br/>What was good was that the story followed and respected the groundwork that had been laid before. Like all great heroes, they don't just pop up one day and say ""Here I am to save the world"". No, they are seasoned, experienced veterans who are alive and kicking because they were smarter then all the other people who didn't live all that long.<br/><br/>Previous Terminator films almost made it sound as if the Resistance was nothing more then a motley crew of ragtag fighters fighting for survival. This made them considerably more organized.<br/><br/>One thing that did surprise me was that this is NOT a Christian Bale movie. Yes, Christian Bale is in it, and I happen to believe that man can do no wrong when it comes to acting (yes even Newsboys). His Batman voice was a bit overplayed and at one point I was half expecting his to start muttering ""Whyrutryingtokillme"".<br/><br/>Never the less, the film more focused on the Resistance as a whole, and Conner's affect on the resistance. It showed more how he grew into the role as John Conner, Leader.<br/><br/>Lots of action. LOTS of action. One great thing is that McG chose to use more robots when possible as opposed to CGI. CGI is overplayed and makes everything look fake. This was about as real as a movie as I have seen in a while up to and including a very realistic auto rotation that as a former helicopter student, I was very well aware of the ramifications of.<br/><br/>Again, it followed the storyline very well and as far as plot holes go, I will get into that with the ""cons"".<br/><br/>The Cons.<br/><br/>What most people are complaining about:<br/><br/>The time line. Alright, first of the Terminator does create a mess of predestination paradox's. But without getting into a whole philosophical diatribe about something that could never really happen anyways I will say this: What is going to happen, is ultimately going to happen. You cannot change the future, only delay the outcome. It's not to say that you don't have a choice you do, however it's simply a matter of catching up to that choice and, to quote, understand that choice.<br/><br/>If they changed the future in the second film then the time line creates a huge paradox anyways that says that Kyle Reese, while still being born at one point or another will never have a reason to go back into time to impregnate Sarah Conner and John Conner is never born...<br/><br/>Therefore at some point or another, the events that happen have to happen.<br/><br/>Which is why in the 3rd one, Arnie says that Judgement day is inevitable you only have to survive it.<br/><br/>Nextly and this is what secret agent J had to gripe about, was the whole dropping into the center of the Machine City or Skynet Central and there being almost no resistance what-so-ever. Let's be honest. If the machines really wanted to wipe us out, then it wouldn't be that difficult. Drop a few nukes. The just mercilessly eradicate us all. Non stop slaughter. No rest no quarter. Thats why in a movie such as ""The Matrix"", the machines effectively DID win. It was only by fighting from the inside out did humanity have a chance.<br/><br/>That being said, you have to take certain liberties to make the machines less then what they are. And because of those liberties you can have static bases, utilities, aircraft weaponry and a whole other schlew of things at your disposal in order to have some semblance of hope.<br/><br/>So, Skynet has to be vulnerable. And call it profound arrogance on the Machines part. Why should they need to have sentries and armed personal guarding it's most valued base of operations? Why? Because in all their logic and mathematical precision they can never compute something that is random chance. They cannot think outside the box of numbers and statistics. Getting to that point is in the machines eyes a mathematical impossibility.<br/><br/>Next, and this is a gripe that I do agree with.<br/><br/>Molten steel has been proved effective in the decimation of T800's. Why oh why it didn't work on the model in the movie is beyond me. Nitrogen gas, commonly used for cooling seem to be an effective method for immobilizing T1000's.<br/><br/>Now physics states that if you super heat something, and then super cool it at an extreme rate that it usually shatters pretty quickly. like taking a hot frying pan and dropping it in water will most definitely warp it beyond use.<br/><br/>Why it wasn't the case here is beyond me as it has proved effective time and time again.<br/><br/>Lastly, the paying homage to the previous Terminator films by re-imaging certain sequences got old fast. It was almost on the order of history repeats itself or what goes around comes around. Yes we know, your mom fought the terminator walking up the flight of stair just like you are now.<br/><br/>Yes we know your Terminator buddy in the second film got pounded with in the chest with a steel girder just like your Terminator buddy is right now.<br/><br/>However, the use of Arnold as the T800 prototype was AMAZING! Well thought out, and well played and epic beyond belief.<br/><br/>A definite redemption from the campy Terminator 3 debacle!"
"blace638","7","3","5","24 May 2009"," Great action film and a worthy successor to the series
","The almost 2 hour long Terminator Salvation flew by while I was watching it. I couldn't believe 2 hours had just gone by. You know what that means? I was royally entertained. It's not the perfect summer blockbuster (and isn't as good as Star Trek), but it's a well made action film with plenty of eye candy to behold.<br/><br/>Terminator Salvation is a different type of movie than its predecessors. While those were also action films, they also had humor and had a much lighter tone than the one present in Salvation. This is Terminator at its darkest yet. It is a war movie after all. Some might miss the humor of the earlier films, but I didn't really mind. Plus there are plenty of easter eggs for series fans to catch and laugh at along the way. It's kind of weird that this is the first Terminator to not have an R rating though. Just proves that violence isn't nearly as bad as sex and foul language according to the MPAA.<br/><br/>I can't really get into story specifics because it will make my head spin with all this time travel stuff, but Salvation does a good job of setting up everything that was hinted at in the other movies. There's nothing there that hasn't been told to us already though, which means little to no surprises. Its purpose is basically just to show everything that was told rather than expand the story. That's for the sequels. I will say though, that Marcus Wright (played by Sam Worthington) is the best character in the movie and Worthington gives a good performance as someone who is trying to figure out what the difference between man and machine is. Christian Bale is a decent John Connor. Nothing extraordinary but he gets the job done. The character isn't nearly as developed as Marcus though, which is a shame since John is so integral to the story. Anton Yelchin does a solid job as the young Kyle Reese as well. Everyone else has little to no screen time and isn't worth mentioning (though a certain cameo will have series vets smiling).<br/><br/>Terminator Salvation is basically nothing but action and special effects and it's all done beautifully. McG might have struggled with some things, but action was not one of them. Some people might even feel a little Transformers in this movie (I certainly did), which I don't consider a bad thing. While the earlier films were basically one big chase sequence, Salvation is huge set piece after huge set piece and you can clearly see that huge budget.<br/><br/>Ultimately, in terms of summer blockbusters this year, Salvation is a couple notches ahead of Wolverine and a notch below Star Trek. Action junkies will love it and I'm sure most Terminator fans will welcome it with welcome arms after the hate that Terminator 3 got. It's a solid new beginning for a franchise that has huge potential."
"PeterPPK","7","3","5","24 May 2009"," Eh...it was OK I guess
","I went to see Terminator Salvation last night and before seeing it, I didn't expect much. I just expected it to be an action/war flick and I thought that I would be mildly entertained, and I was. However, I still had problems with this movie.<br/><br/>First of all, this movie was too short. It didn't have as many memorable scenes as the first three(maybe two)had. It just simply wasn't long enough.<br/><br/>Another problem was Christen Bale. Not that I dislike him, but I just don't think he did too well in this movie. At least he was believable but I still felt that he could've done better as the role of John Connor Lastly, to me it just didn't have the humor and fun that the first three had. In the first movie, the humor was Arnold saying ""F*** you asshole"". There was a lot of humor in the second movie mostly revolving around young John Connor, and the Terminator(the good one). And in the third movie, the fun was probably all the scenes of destruction and the car chase scenes. However, in this movie, there just wasn't any fun and any humor. Probably the reason being is because its a post-apocalyptic setting, so everything's destroyed.<br/><br/>Now, if you wanted to see this movie and had high hopes for it but now feel bummed out after reading my review, don't worry. The movie does have its problems, but if you don't look over it too much then its not all bad. The action sequences were great and you get to see all the different terminators, which is pretty cool.<br/><br/>All in all, I'd would actually recommend seeing it. It's a good movie if you don't look too deep into it.<br/><br/>I give it 7/10"
"rudy-altergott","7","3","5","23 May 2009"," A Sequel/Prequel That Works
","In a nutshell, Salvation is a nice start to what will hopefully be a trilogy within the Terminator franchise that shows us the constantly mentioned but briefly shown War Against the Machines. With old and new characters and allusions to the previous films, as well as unprecedented action sequences, it proves to be quite a ride. If you come in with limited prior reservations, you will not be very disappointed.<br/><br/>John Connor is NOT YET leader of the Resistance (I'd assume he's the equivalent of an army captain), but to many is it's spiritual leader. This allows for more drama between himself and the hard-line top commanders like General Ashdown (Michael Ironside), as well as character development. He is not sure what to do, even with limited advice from Sarah Connor's past messages. Marcus Wright complicates things even further, and he is brought to the breaking point.<br/><br/>What sells this movie is the fact that it is a turning point in the War, with the introduction of Kyle Reese to John Connor and vice versa, which is integral to the storyline (for those of you who do not know, Connor sent Reese back in time to prevent the death of his mother by a Terminator unit in 1984, and secretly to meet and fall in love with Sarah Connor and procreate John). It is also a new storyline about Marcus Wright, who thinks he is a long dead executed convict who died in 2004. At the beginning of the movie, he signs a document allowing Cyberdyne to use his body for ""research"", later revealed to be so he could become a Terminator unit for a specific reason. The well-crafted plot flows rather smoothly and keeps your attention and, for fans, fascination as to how the dramatic irony plays out.<br/><br/>Though not a perfect epic, this film captures a lot of what I at least envisioned John Connor and the War. Skynet is unbelievably bigger than ever before, and an old friend makes a cameo (sort of) in one of its headquarters. In the end, a minor victory is won, as expected. But the best part about it is that the War rages on, and we can only imagine what will be thrown John Connor's way next, though we think we know what will eventually come to pass. It's like he says, repeating his mother, in the last line of the film: ""There is no fate but what we make.""<br/><br/>This is Rudy Altergott. If you're reading this, you are the Resistance."
"chrisjcorvasce","7","3","5","23 May 2009"," Better than Terminator Better than T3 Judgment Day still Rules
","Many critics in the media complained that the film was loud or Christian Bale carried his ""Batman"" accent over or the surplus of explosive scenes. I agree and at the same time; disagree. Yes; ""Terminator Salvation"" is loud but let us not forget what genre it falls in with. Of course it is a science fiction action based film. However this film unlike those before is unique relative to the franchise. It is unique in the fact that the entire movie's plot involves the war between humans and machines. Which is something Terminator that fans have waited decades for. Therefore I feel that the War film genre has a place for this newest installment. Just like the majority of war movies there is little dialogue, lots of explosions and action sequences and is also very loud. So to complain on the excess of Bangs and Booms shows ignorance to the films setting and plot summing up to be a sci-fi action war film.<br/><br/>I must also argue with those claiming that Bale used his ""Batman"" voice in his role as John Conner. In the beginning of the film you can sense a similarity but it fades quickly as the story progresses. Bale instead gives his character the voice of an American G.I grunt. Conner's voice represents an individual who is experienced and also fatigued from the war that dictated his entire life starting from Birth. Like I said before; this film is slim when it comes to dialogue and to my disappointment is also ignorant to the talent of Bryce Dallas Howard. Also the importance of her role is disregarded. The film also pays absolutely no attention to the fact that Kate Brewster is far along into a pregnancy. The pregnancy is not referred to or mentioned by any of the characters in T4. Kate is simply pregnant looking. Also the film fails to capitalize on the romantic relationship between Conner and Brewster and neglects to even make an attempt at explaining the intertwined destinies of the couple and their soon to be child. <br/><br/>On a side note; if you watch the previous Terminator films you will notice that during the various flash backs or brief glimpses of the war to come; you will notice that both sides use laser weapons. ""Terminator Salvation is completely contemporary with weapons. More specifically the different fire arms discharge bullets or shells as opposed to lasers. This obviously was a good decision. Let's face it; laser guns are so 80's.<br/><br/>On a whole I gave the film a rating of 7. A 7 because the story has some unexpected occurrences, plot twist even though they are rather shallow and most importantly the story revolving around the character Kyle Reese as a very young man with potential to be a great warrior as effectively demonstrated. Also the whole idea of Reese being younger than his son Conner is although not completely original but different than what movie plots of today have to offer. With that said I really must recommend that you view the previous 3 films of the franchise before seeing Terminator Salvation. If you have not seen all of the three films leading up; not only will you be lost or confused but you will also be incapable of appreciating the many parts of the canonical film that are key to enjoying another great addition to the franchise"

","One word to describe this movie: kablooey. I can't remember seeing this much action in a film in a long time. TS contains numerous action sequences that really throw you in the middle of it. It feels like one of those interactive 3-D experiences where your seat moves according to the respective action. It was a thrill ride from start to finish but I can't say that it didn't get a bit tiresome. I mean, I can only be impressed and startled by so many explosions until I'm just exhausted from it.<br/><br/>The movie seemed to adapt many sequences from Cloverfield. The camera is shaky and may not cut for a solid 2 minutes. This I liked. It really showed some director skill. But the screenplay is poor and the acting is sub-par. Christian Bale uses his Batman voice for the entire movie. It gets a little annoying. Arnold's cameo is mediocre but it was fun to see him appear. I recommend going to the theaters to see TS, because I don't see how the DVD version can be nearly as effective. TS is better than T3 but far from T2. If you enjoyed Transformers and Cloverfield, this film is for you."
"SnacksForAll","7","3","5","22 May 2009"," Wanted to Hate it...couldn't. Pleasantly surprised.
","After a lot of negative feedback from the online ""geek"" community, my worst fears nearly ruined my going to see this flick. I have loved the TERMINATOR series since I was a kid; I watched every episode of the ill-fated but great TV series, and though I knew Terminator 3 would be a misstep, I was there on opening night anyway.<br/><br/>From having a director called 'McG' to the early buzz about some rather clunky plot devices and dialog in SALVATION, I was afraid the newest and best chance to again realize the great potential of this cross-time saga would fail. I entered the cinema with slumped shoulders and horribly low expectations, ready to hate and come home to write a scathing review on IMDb.<br/><br/>And then a funny thing happened. From the opening credits onward, I found myself enjoying the film and trying hard not to.<br/><br/>First, Bale owns this picture. I liked Worthington, but he doesn't steal the picture from Christian Bale as some have been saying. The title character was an engrossing presence on-screen and it's a shame we don't get more time with him. But I guess wanting more is always a good sign in showbiz.<br/><br/>The action, of course, is great. The ""mushroom cloud"" scene, ""Harvester"" scene and the climactic battle at the end are all very memorable and well-executed. What's more, they further the plot.<br/><br/>Which brings me to my next point. The story moves along at a well-developed clip, cleverly (but not brilliantly) handling dueling plot lines and, for the most part, managing to hold the viewer's attention and keep him or her guessing what might happen next.<br/><br/>Yes, there could have been more character development. But a few of the performances are absolutely just knocked out of the park. The real hero of this film is Anton Yelchin, embodying the intense but noble Kyle Reese (as portrayed by Michael Beihn) in the first film. He succeeds in creating a convincingly tough but sympathetic young hero-to-be. His performance, in fact, is one of the hallmarks of the film.<br/><br/>The film's weakest attributes are, as mentioned, some amateur dialog, a feel-good and tacked-on ending, and last (but certainly not least), the ""Star"" character, a mute little girl played by ""Jadagrace."" It feels like I've seen this character a million times, and a cutesy cliché such as this has no business in a serious movie where the human race is being exterminated in a global war against machines.<br/><br/>Another unfortunate side of this film is the editing and runtime. It feels as if whole chunks of plot are missing; moving lines that you might hear in the exciting movie trailers and TV spots promoting the film are not here. If I didn't know as much about the movie as I did going in, I imagine I would be quite confused. The editing itself is also choppy and in places disjointed. Personally, I'm getting tired of the ""Aw heck, we'll just put it on the DVD"" mindset. The best film should always be put forward during its debut. Herein lies one of the problems with TERMINATOR SALVATION.<br/><br/>With that said, I couldn't help but like the film, and felt QUITE relieved that this wasn't the cinematic cataclysm I was afraid would ruin a franchise. As flawed as it is, it's not a bad start. And you know what? I was entertained and thinking about it the next day.<br/><br/>How bad can that be?"

It's nowhere near what T1 and T2 are character-wise, but remember those are also two of the best sci-fi films ever made.<br/><br/>See this movie with an open mind and remember this isn't trying to be a carbon copy plot of the first two films with cheap gags like T3 was. This film is taking the Terminator story into a place it hasn't been on the silver screen: the war between man and machine."
"joestank15","6","3","5","21 May 2009"," Fun with strong performances from Bale and Worthington.
","Terminator Salvation - The year is 2018. The machines rule, and the humans are on the losing side. John Conner (Christian Bale) battles on, but he needs the help of Marcus Wright (Sam Worthington), a half-human half machine experiment of Skynet to save Kyle Reese.<br/><br/>McG seems to have a chip on his shoulder that stems no doubt from his nickname. He and this film are twin souls - each trying to prove their existence in the world of cinema. T3 left the world bombed to hell and added a few carelessly thought out plot elements that hurt the attitude of the series in general (nuclear cores? robots pre-designed to not kill?), but the underlying problem with the series has always been the characters struggling to undo the future that has already had it's shape on the past. Now we have characters trying to secure the past that has already happened. Confusing? Kind of. Does it need to be here? Questionable. Is it fun? Quite often actually.<br/><br/>Christian Bale adds weight and seriousness to the film. He's still not freakin' leader of the resistance, but we see elements of why this will be so. Sam Worthington is very watchable as Marcus Cole. His battle for humanity is (literally) the film's beating heart. If nothing else from this movie stays with you afterwards (and hopefully more than a few elements will, as it's a decently put together film) his performance should. Bale and Worthington's scenes together are some of the best in the film, and it's a pity there aren't more.<br/><br/>There are lots of cool robots. Robots that swim, drive motorcycles, shoot the series' iconic miniguns, and giant ones with cannons and grabbers. All of these make for good bangs and summer entertainment. The lack of laser weapons and fields of skulls ripe for crunching might disappoint series diehards, but overall the action is quite good. The T-800 has never been so formidable.<br/><br/>Terminator Salvation, like John Conner for mankind, was hoped to be the tentpole for future movies. It's hard to see happen, unless Direct to DVD is your thing. This was a good film, but it's hard to see them taking the series any further.<br/><br/>Terminator Salvation gets a B-"

"hollywoodusedspankey","1","31","100","21 May 2009"," Horrid film!!!!
","Do not get it wrong people just because Christian Bale is the ""star"" of a movie it does not mean it is a quality film by any means. I am sick of films using hot chicks (Moon Bloodgood) who cant act just to have a pretty face in the film. Also Christian Bale and Bryce Dallas Howard have absolutely zero amount of chemistry on film. Its like they are two people who just met and are not sure how to act around each other. Intense performance from Bale and laughable from the rest of the cast. The only redeeming part of this film are the Terminators themselves. If you want to go see a good film go see ""Star Trek"" or ""Up"". I guess we should have expected this from McG, the guy did ""Charlie's Angels"" for gods sake."
"Choccster","1","7","17","4 June 2009"," Johnny Connor & The Passable Terminator
","This film did not tickle my Endorphin-bone. It baffles my mind how (at the time of writing) this film has an average of 7.3.<br/><br/>But let's get down and dirty. The reason for my vote of three (3) is primarily that I simply could not identify with any of the characters. With seven important characters (I assume we'll see more of over the next two installments), it was difficult to get to know any of them sufficiently.<br/><br/>Then there's the lack of real danger. John Connor did not have a lot of obstacles. Never did I feel he was in any real danger. He got into Skynet far too easily and got himself out easily too.<br/><br/>The purpose of the Marcus character was one thing I didn't quite get either. After seeing the film for the first time my initial reaction is 'did they put him in the film just so he could give up his heart in the final scene, so that Connor could live'? Then again that can apply to the mute girl too. She gave Connor the remote detonator when they were airborne, so that he could blow up Skynet.<br/><br/>With the amount of characters it's difficult to believe that mankind is in any danger. In the first Terminator film, it was up to Sarah alone. In the next two, she had her son and Arnold Schwarzenegger. Take any of them out of the equation and mankind is doomed. However in the case of Terminator: Salvation, I just don't see what impact the death of either of the seven could have on mankind's survival. And so I don't care about the fates of any of them.<br/><br/>I am willing to forgive them for making such a barely passable film if it was just to introduce us to the seven characters. I understand that we'll be seeing a lot more of them and probably get some more back-story on each. Maybe even a few more story lines. The Marcus storyline in T4 was poor at best. It didn't matter whether he was man or machine, I didn't care about him. He had no personality. I did not care about his past. Nor his future. Was he really just a plot device to get John Connor into Skynet?...<br/><br/>But despite its many flaws, I guess an over-the-top Terminator is better than no Terminator. To quote Kevin Smith (on Batman & Robin); ""Better with camp Batman than no Batman."""
"kneiss1","5","4","8","8 November 2010"," Another one of that well made movies with a horrible script
","I guess I can finally say it this simple: New Hollywood movies become more and more stupid, while they look better and better. I have seen so many new Hollywood movies with a bad script. It really is a pity. The worst in those movies are usually the downright stupid, cheesy, no sense making endings. - Just like in Terminator Salvation. <br/><br/>If I give a Hollywood movie 5 points, especially one like Terminator Salvation, that means, that I personally consider it worse. I hate those bad scripts. I don't understand how a movie can go through so many ""hands"", without anyone realizing how bad the conversations and the story is. - Objectively, there are worse movies out there. The great action and special effects are enough to keep me entertained. That is why I am still forced to give the movie 5 points. - Even though I personally value a good story a lot more."
"MBunge","4","4","8","3 June 2010"," It's the aging Michael Corleone of Terminator films
","This movie is the Godfather III of the Terminator franchise. Judged on its own merits, it's really not THAT bad for a summer action movie. Compared to the previous films, even the fairly weak Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines, it bites the big one.<br/><br/>Set after the artificial intelligence Skynet has destroyed most of mankind in a nuclear attack, you can tell right away that Terminator Salvation is going to be one of those movies you can't think about too hard. For example, you can't think about why there was no radioactive fallout left behind from Skynet's nuclear attack. Apparently these filmmakers never cracked a book on the actual affects of an atomic explosion. And that sort of thing, the complete disregard of logic, physics and causality, just gets worse and worse as the story goes along.<br/><br/>Now, you'd guess that after three movies leading up to it, the story of John Connor (Christian Bale) leading the human resistance against genocidal robots would have been the plot of this film. For some inexplicable reason, it's not. John Connor is barely more than a supporting character in Terminator Salvation. The main character in the movie is really Marcus Wright (Sam Worthington). Wright is a death row prisoner who, before Skynet's attack, donated his body to science. About a decade and a half after his execution, he crawls out of the remains of a destroyed Skynet base looking perfectly fine and with no memory of how he ended up in this dystopic future. The first half of the movie is mostly about Wright wandering around nuclear devastated Southern California, meeting Kyle Reece (Anton Yelchin), the guy who gets sent back in time in the first Terminator movie, and a human resistance fighter named Blair Williams (Moon Bloodgood). While that's going on, we get a bunch of exposition scenes with John Connor butting heads with the leaders of the resistance movement and what Edmund Blackadder would call a ""cunning plan"" to defeat Skynet.<br/><br/>Eventually, Wright and Connor meet and we discover the secret of Wright's reappearance. Since this is a Terminator movie, you can probably guess what that secret is even if you haven't seen the film. Wright and Connor then team up to rescue Reece, who's been taken prisoner by Skynet. That rescue involves pretty much every action movie cliché you can think of, including the old ""it was a trap all along"" and ""the villain now explains the entire plan to the hero"". Then the movie ends by re-emphasizing that this story was really about Marcus Wright and that the whole purpose of Terminator Salvation was to perpetuate the franchise and take more of your money.<br/><br/>This is, by far, the worst Terminator movie yet and proves that the whole thing should have never gotten beyond the first two films. The Terminator presented a black view of humanity that would lead us to destruction. Terminator II: Judgment Day saved us from that future and argued that humanity was worth saving. The story should have ended there, something proved when the third film could only justify its existence by totally contradicting the point of Terminator II. Now we have a fourth film that only exists to set the stage for even more Terminator movies to come. Hopefully, it bombed hard enough at the box office to spare us all from that fate.<br/><br/>Christian Bale has little more to do in this film but stand around and yell. Bryce Dallas Howard, playing Connor's wife Kate, has nothing to do but stand around and be pregnant. Sam Worthington and Moon Bloodgood do a fine job, but nobody wants to go to a fourth Terminator film to watch characters they've never seen before. And Michael Biehn's Kyle Reece would have chewed up Anton Yelchin's version and crapped him out.<br/><br/>Except for the ending battle, which is almost laughably ill-conceived, Terminator Salvation has some decent action scenes, a few interesting special effects and effectively mirrors moments from the previous films. That's it, though. There's no genuine human drama and the moral or societal theme of the story is childish and poorly thought out compared to first three movies. And though these filmmakers spent well over $150 million creating a post-apocalyptic future, James Cameron created a better and more compelling vision of that future over 30 years ago with just a few lines of dialog and the equivalent of $150 worth of special effects.<br/><br/>I'm sure when Cameron and company came up with the first two Terminator films, they wanted to make money. But they were driven to tell interesting and meaningful stories. The last two Terminator films were created just to make money and whether they were any good was, at best, a secondary concern. I think we'd all be better off if this franchise was put out of its and our misery."
"david-phillips-4","4","4","8","21 January 2010"," Continues the downward spiral of the franchise
","Since The Terminator, I have anticipated the arrival of a sequel that will extend the thrills of that excellent first movie. Terminator 2 just about managed it, Terminator 3 was woeful and the Sarah Connor Chronicles just didn't do it for me. Then along comes Terminator: Salvation. Having seen the Bond franchise get reinvented and reinvigorated, I had high hopes for another Terminator instalment. Even when I saw that McG would be at the helm, I figured that perhaps he too was looking for reinvention. Perhaps Salvation code be the keyword for everyone involved. With Christian Bale onboard, it did seem as though this could be moving in the right direction. (I, personally, would have loved to have seen a similar dark and foreboding movie to the Dark Knight.) Alas, no. That was not be. If anything, McG confirmed himself as a name to avoid when seen on the credits. Bale seemed to get more air time for his infamous rant than actually as John Connor. And the reinvention just didn't happen. If anything, it carried on from where Terminator 3 left off. Except this time, it had delusions of grandeur as it appears that it tries to deal with the conflicts felt by a man half human and half machine. From the opening scenes, we are aware of what is going on and, unfortunately, where this is going. It then seems to be a case of waiting for the movie to catch up with the audience, as we are already miles ahead. Sam Worthington is the real star of the show and, it must be said, he does at least seem to be really trying. He throws himself into the role with gusto. Yet, even with all of his effort, if anything the film surrounding him lets him down. Bale seems so detached from the whole movie that you could be forgiven for thinking that he filmed all of his scenes separately to anyone else. It looks like he's not really feeling it, which also led me to believe that perhaps his rant was his frustration at being signed up on a sinking ship. A ship I believe he has signed up to for at least one more voyage. Then we have Anton Yelchin, of whom I have read that he studied Michael Biehn's performance in The Terminator to try and get his characterisation as accurate as possible. Unfortunately, this was a complete waste. As soon as he appeared and spoke on screen, I was left wondering how the Doogie Howser MD-a-like that was before me could ever develop into Biehn's Kyle Reese. They do deal with the appearance of the Schwarzenegger terminator quite well. It gets away with his recreated image looking a little odd, as he features as an off the production line terminator, so perhaps not quite as realistic as later on (in the earlier movies). There are also several obligatory nods to the earlier films, but these are more likely to cause eye rolling than delight. The film does not want for action sequences, but it does want for a reasonable way of threading them together and at least involving the viewer in what is going on. There seemed an ideal opportunity within this movie to use the ""future shapes the past, shapes the future"" mechanism to make the viewer question everything. Could the outcome of this movie effectively render the other movies obsolete? Those buttons were tentatively pushed, but nowhere near hard or often enough. Instead, I found myself watching the film through it's entirety to confirm what I thought it was going to be like after the first few minutes. Unfortunately, it confirmed that it was disappointing. McG is confirmed as the director of Terminator 5; perhaps this time it should be called Terminator: Last Chance. See more at www.writeronthestorm.wordpress.com"
"Nikolaevna_Romanov","3","4","8","19 December 2009"," McG could've done better
","Despite the absence of Arnold Schwarzenegger, I consider Terminator Salvation to be an improvement of Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines, which remains the worst of the franchise. Nonetheless, it is still poor and fails to live up to the first two films.<br/><br/>When I heard director McG was chosen to direct the fourth sequel, my reaction was, ""who and what is an McG?"" I began to despair when I found out he directed Charlies' Angels, and I lost even more hope when I saw the trailer. Perhaps it wasn't his idea, but why the Motor-Terminators & Hydrobots? Whoever thought of those (even if it was Stan Winston) had obviously gone too far.<br/><br/>When I found out the plot would be set in the future, I remained optimistic as we've hardly seen much of the future war. But having seen the film, the future battles from the first two movies is more than enough. When I found out the theme is not Brad Fiedel's, I breathed a sigh of relief (better for Fiedel's theme to stay with the best). I wonder why the director chose to show the movie title twice at the start.<br/><br/>The film lacks original screenplay, with McG copying many notable actions, moments & lines from the first two. The mechanical sounds from the Terminator is similar to that heard in Transformers, not to mention a rip-off. Perhaps McG should direct Transformers 3, he deserves it.<br/><br/>It's also very disappointing to know that the role of the Terminator is very short, appearing only at the end. Was it really so hard for the writers to give Roland Kikinger a starring role, preferably in place of Marcus Wright but as the T-800 instead? Using Arnold's CGI face does not change anything, it was way too short as well. The only positive I can take from this film is that McG did not make a mockery of the franchise the way Jonathan Mostow did in T3.<br/><br/>The Director's Cut version does not change my opinion of this film, in fact it's worse. Kudos to McG for following in the footsteps of Jonathan Mostow, further ruining the franchise's reputation. Highly recommended for those who crave action and have low expectations though."

But what can I say, I tried to give it a chance.<br/><br/>I hate to say it... but I think even if Michael Bay himself had gotten his hands on this it might have been better.

"Lempea","5","4","8","23 September 2009"," Lacks heart
","So. I more or less enjoyed the movie, but it just lacks heart. It is a Terminator itself: a flawless, eye-candy, well-oiled machine with great photography, great sets, great special effects, great sounds, great designs, great CGI Arnold, great music, but no heart. That kind of movie doesn't work without a heart, technics is just not enough! ""Terminator 2"" was the best of the series, because Cameron added a heart to his machine, like he added a heart to the Alien franchise. ""Aliens"" is pointless without its heart. I don't like that kind of flick because of drooling Xenomorphs, but because of a working chemistry between Ripley, Newt and Hicks, and even the other Marines. So a heart and character chemistry is what can save an action flick from being boring and/or shallow, and at least get some praise for the critics, which is always great for an action flick. Films are not made like in the 80s or the 90s, but that doesn't mean good movies cannot be made anymore.<br/><br/>The character development for ""Terminator Salvation"" is nonexistent. John Connor and its raspy voice and facial paralysis is boring, and you cannot attach or relate to him. He can die or live, it doesn't matter. He's just bland. The CGI Arnold was a good surprise for me, but again it's too anecdotal and Connor's reaction to the familiar face is everything but true to his background. I love Christian Bale's work, he made so many great movies, but this time he doesn't give his best (although it's obviously not entirely his fault, having little to no creative input as an actor). Connor's relation with Kate is anecdotal; they don't share a strong, deep moment of privacy together, there's no reference to her pregnancy, and her three lines don't make her believable. Good thing that Kyle Reese was not an annoying Anakin Skywalker-like teenager, so I guess the team remembered that no matter young a prequel character is, you have to avoid making them silly children or dumb teenagers. So he was OK, strong enough, not annoying at all (at least for me), but lacked depth. His only more or less deep sentence in the Terminator ship was really out of place, and one sentence doesn't catch up for the lack of everything else.<br/><br/>It seems that the team wanted to cover many subjects, so in the end they ended up with many good ideas, but wanted to keep them all. So in order to keep all those things in a 2-hour movie, nothing ends up fully finished but barely skimmed through, trimmed and half good or half bad. I think they should have left behind some stuff, and expanded only the best, to not end up with this feeling of an over-the-top, unfinished movie.<br/><br/>Blinding the audience with overwhelming special effects to cover the lack of heart will not dupe the hardened spectator. Giving this to McG was like giving the X-Men franchise to Brett Ratner. They are not incompetent, but that's just not their kind of thing. They should stick to making comedies and let people who can really relate to that genre do it. Of course, the screenwriters and the producers are the first to blame.<br/><br/>So yeah, ""Terminator Salvation"" is an eye-candy failure. You can enjoy it, but just forget it's a sequel to two great James Cameron films."

","Awful script and pretty poor, totally mediocre directing kill this one. McG, what a ridiculous name/nickname for a director, for anybody in fact who should not be mentally a teenager anymore. Sounds like ""Big Mac"" and his films are equally nutritional. Keep this dude away from directing any decent script in the future, please. He cannot direct even the fight scenes properly, which is most surprising for a ""fast food"" director. I could go on and on about the weaknesses, plot holes in the script and lack of character depth or development but what's the point, others here covered it pretty well already. I just want to add that C. Bale lacks necessary charisma and charm in this role and is mis-cast; in addition even the praised special effects and the landscape that is supposed to project post-apocalyptic California are pretty rubbish too, at times the movie seems to be made directly for TV. Rent it if u must but it is not worth the cinema ticket price."

I thought that line was going to be used in an extremely memorable context; That it would be almost as popular as ""I'll be back"". I thought it was going to be used in a dire situation which called for such intensity.<br/><br/>Nope.<br/><br/>It was used during some scene where dudes are hanging out in an aircraft hangar. Maybe I wasn't paying close enough attention, but the scene was almost like a tourette's outburst. He's yelling at some dude over a radio. There's nothing really going on in the scene. Just some yelling with a few dudes standing around. That's it.<br/><br/>You'd expect him to be under fire from a giant horde of robots, him laying in a ditch screaming it into a radio link or something.<br/><br/>Nope.<br/><br/>Hangar with dudes. No dramatic music. Just out of place yelling into a mic.<br/><br/>Don't let me overshadow the other epic failures of this film with this irk of mine.

Nothing looks or feels natural. Hell, the flashback scenes of the soldiers vs. the robots in the earlier Terminator movies are MORE ENTERTAINING AND MEMORABLE than this whole movie.<br/><br/>I think somebody else said it here, and I'd like to reiterate: This movie makes T3 look like a masterpiece. I'm not joking. I'd rather watch T3 on an Ipod screen without sound than watch T4 on Imax."

","I was uncomfortable about watching this but did so with some friends and found myself as appalled as I was watching the empty second and third installments. The whole concept is flawed and has become a pathetic money spinning yarn. The first film was an excellent stand alone movie and when the endless one liner filled second installment came along I was crushed by the oversight of the paradox. A computer designed from the brain chip of a Terminator it sent back in time to kill Sarah??? This film is headed by a very boring Christian Bale who has as much passion and personality as the bullets he shoots. Antoin Yelchin gave a good turn as Kyle Reese but it was not enough to save this insult of a movie. The first is an excellent stand alone film and if anyone has sense they will forget the 'pure entertainment' sequels. The Arnie CGI at the end is incredible and it was one of the two things that impressed me. I won't be watching this again..."

","Full Throttle I quite liked in a funny sort of way. A very postmodern endeavour; not claiming any originality, tasteless, all traces of narrative extinguished so that we are left with an empty set of signs with no meaning. I can watch Full Throttle and chuckle at the deliberate stupidity. For Terminator Salvation, though, I think it only fair that McG takes a double tap to the head in a Hollywood back street. A disappointed fanboy, a Blackwater thug suffering from PTSD who's hired himself out to Christian Bale's agent, the executor of Cormac McCarthy's estate... I don't mind who gets the satisfaction, but I think McG's pushed his luck too far. Hurlbut was a patsy, Surely Bale was actually more pi$$ed off with McG for saying, 'Christian baby, that voice you did for Batman, that was cool. can you do it again, but make it less convincing?' It's a modest proposal, taking McG out. After all, he took a real heavily-pregnant woman off the street and got her to stand around on set because he couldn't find an actress to play Connor's wife. That's just mean. The poor lady looked completely distraught, not knowing what to do. I can say I enjoyed the first 20 minutes or so, or was it 15, up until I could hear McG's voice in my ear saying, 'Helena, can you push the wimple back a bit more'.<br/><br/>McG should definitely not be given a second chance. Maybe, people can change. Maybe in a few years he'll wake up one morning, slip out from between the twin hookers and struggle to the bathroom, look in the mirror and suddenly wonder what he's done with his life, angrily swiping away the piles of coke and empty Red Bull cans he'll shout to himself, 'NO. I've wasted my LIFE.' and go on to make a shorter, pithier version of Heimat. But why take the chance. Even better, somebody make some sort of machine and go back in time to stop him making Salvation in the first place."

"moveeguy-1","3","4","8","23 June 2009"," Terminator Salvation
","I saw two films this weekend... ""Up"" and ""Terminator Salvation"". What a contrast in cinematic style and filmgoing experience. ""Up"" was entertaining, skillfully paced, nuanced, and cleverly simple. TS, on the other hand, was a clumsy medicine ball of overblown, clichéd action, dull direction, oh-so-earnest acting, ugly cinematography, and uninspired/uninspiring CGI.<br/><br/>Honestly, I wasn't expecting much from this film going in. I was quite familiar with McG's previous work and, to put it politely, I'm not a fan. But how could you go too wrong with a ""Terminator"" film? James Cameron had written the syllabus of high energy, high speed, high production value action films with ""Terminator"" and ""T2: Judgement Day"". Even T3, while a disappointment compared to the previous two films, was viewable and even mildly entertaining.<br/><br/>But this new ""Terminator"" was to be what's come to be called a ""reboot"". It was to take a once-mighty action franchise whose welcome was wearing thin and ""re-imagining"" it. A new bloated budget, new MTV generation director, state-of-the-art CGI, Christian Bale in place of Schwartzenegger, etc, etc, etc. A surefire hit... yes? Well, sadly, no.<br/><br/>One example as to this film's failings... James Cameron's signature open for the first two ""Terminator"" films was a simple device. The Arnold robot first encounters unsuspecting victims of the present. Conflict begins, and, with all the warmth of titanium and hydraulic fluid, Arnold resoundingly crushes all comers, takes their weapons as his own, and decks himself out with the terminator uniform for that film. Not Chekhov, but an entertaining way to introduce the character and get the story rolling.<br/><br/>This film opens with a long, dreary vignette where a condemned man agrees to donate his body to science. Not only is this entire segment dull and uninteresting... as it turns out, it's totally unnecessary to the story. It tells us nothing about the Marcus character, has little to do with main narrative, and consists of monotonous eyebrow-to-chin close-ups that set the photographic ""style"" of every dialog scene in the film regardless of dramatic import.<br/><br/>There might have been a sigh of relief when we jump to the post-apocalyptic future and the fireworks begin... except you quickly realize you've seen all this crap before. Desaturated palette, costumes and production design that were tapped out before ""Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome""... swish pans and shaky cam to hide mediocre effects and stunt work, muzzle flashes and spark hits galore.<br/><br/>Sound like an action film cliché? It is... Evidently, this is what you get when you take a worn-out franchise, add a director with no vision, and throw $200 million into a pot and stir. You get a forgettable film with poor acting, unengaging narrative, and quick-cut action you've seen done better a hundred times before.<br/><br/>The action in this film almost feels like a collage... You'll see glimpses of ""Road Warrior"", ""Rambo"", ""Star Wars"", ""Aliens"", and, yes, a very indulgent dose of ""Transformers"". In other words, if you've seen those films, you won't find anything remotely new or fresh in this one.<br/><br/>But it has Christian Bale, you say... Certainly the acting must be first class, right? Again, I hate to burst your bubble, but not even close. I have to give the man credit, Bale tries to bring an intensity to every role I've seen him play. But, as we've seen a thousand times before, an intense performance in an inferior film can range from sad to unintentionally comedic. Bale's turn as John Connor more than once slips into the latter category. I don't want to jinx anyone's career, but Bale may be reaching the end of his fifteen minutes... Let's hope Chris Nolan can drag Bale back from the brink of career suicide with the next ""Batman"".<br/><br/>As a whole, this film suffers more from expectations than anything. Without the ""Terminator"" name in the title, this might have been an unexceptional sci-fi/action film viewable as a summer distraction. But ""Terminator Salvation"", despite its pretensions, gets lost in the enormous shadow cast by Cameron's films."
"earderne","3","4","8","17 June 2009"," Very disappointing.
","I went to see this film with high hopes but in my opinion it comes nowhere near the first two films in the series. Arnold Schwarzenegger's character was well developed in both films - as the unstoppable,menacing Terminator who even in the flesh was frightening before being stripped down to his metal skeleton that just wouldn't give up.Also in the second film in his character change to protector of young John Connor and his mother there was humour and a bond between them. The scene where Linda Hamilton as Sarah is watching her son teaching the robot colloquial phrases is touching as she muses that he is like a father figure to the boy and will die to protect him.<br/><br/>Linda Hamilton was wonderful in the two films and did the physical and mental transition in her character from ordinary if brave woman to a much tougher person very well.<br/><br/>Michael Biehn played John Connor's father with depth and there was a real feeling of connection between him and Sarah.<br/><br/>The earlier films had feeling, humour in the characters which is entirely missing from the latest film. It is grim,completely devoid in humour of any kind, and the characters are not at all likable or well developed. Christian Bale has one deadpan expression of misery all through it.He really seems not to enjoy his work these days and should lighten up - personally as well.<br/><br/>Special effects were good, but it is far too noisy and doesn't have the memorable musical soundtrack of the first two films.<br/><br/>Not up to the hype - I would rather watch 'Transformers'.<br/><br/>Mirin"

","I went to see this movie, not expecting anything from it. But I'm happy report, that Terminator Salvation is one of the best action films I've seen for a long while. Critics will say it isn't faithful to the original Terminator movies. Nonsense! Not only does it remain to the faithful to the other Terminator movies, it pays homage to them. McG was smart to add a few references from the first two movies, but at the same time not totally overdo it which would've this a really cheesy film. Performances wise, Christian is immaculate as John Connor, really gave a commanding performance as the future leader of the resistance. The man has to be the best actor in Hollywood by now. Sam Worthington put in a impressive turn as cyborg who desperate wants to be human and added an emotional element to this movie, which Rise of the Machines lacked. Anton Yelchin (straight out of Star Trek) continues to give reliable support to his lead co-stars. I definitely believe he's one to watch. McG as a director has outdone himself, capturing the post apocalyptic city look to a tee. The man has redeemed himself after Charlie's Angels movies (which were a complete disaster) and has put together a kick ass Saturday popcorn munching action flick. All in all, great action, muscular set pieces, brilliant visuals/special effects, solid performances and a good story make Terminator Salvation a worthwhile trip to the cinema. The first two rocked, but this is way better than Rise of the Machines, Stan Winston would be proud."

","I went to see Terminator Salvation today and I have to say it was an awesome film, very enjoyable, one of the best films this year for sure. I do wish people would just go to the cinema and enjoy the film thats why they make films, for our enjoyment. I've been a loyal fan of the franchise since I first saw The Terminator in 1988 and I think Salvation is very loyal to the franchise, amazing special effects and a good story and when i saw Arnold's face as the T800 it brought a smile to my face and it made me feel like a kid again. An amazing film one of my favourites and i think we should start a ""war against the fan boys"" because they have nothing better to do but sit at home on their computers and complain about every little detail in every film, seriously get a life!!!"
"deathiscoming-1","8","4","8","3 June 2009"," well made, believable film, exciting and fun to watch!
","I went to see this film today and honestly on seeing the trailer a couple of weeks ago, I was very sceptical, I thought once again another typical high octane, no brainer action film belittling the already tarnished name (thanks to T3) of a beautiful classic cult film classic. BUT, after watching the film I must admit I felt the slap across my sceptical ego! I really enjoyed the film, it was fast, but not so fast that the film just felt like a 2hr blur in your life, it was cheesy but not ABBA cheesy, and the ""special guest appearance"" was humorous yet serious and a tribute well done. I even enjoyed the CGI! For me this is usually a big issue with films of the 21st century – generally too much CGI, which although looks pretty, doesn't do too much for the film (e.g. the Transformers film). This film is different though, there was just the right amount to remind you that this is a film made with 21st century, HD tech but it didn't override the story! I mean I loved the hydraulic cheek muscles – they move as it talks!<br/><br/>So, why have I given it 8/10? As with most Hollywood films, the medical accuracy seemed WAY OFF. Although an issue for me, I guess most people don't really care. These inaccuracies take place twice during the film, but, although I can almost forgive the first, the second made my skin crawl! The second reason I gave this film 8/10 is because like a lot of films released these days, most of the good bits are put into the trailers! As I sat there watching the film I felt as though I already knew what was going to happen a lot of the time, and the sole reason for that is the fact that I watched 1, yes, 1 trailer for this film. It's a shame they didn't put as much effort into the trailer as they did the film. The last reason (because I just lost the rest of my train of thought) I'm giving this film 8/10, is because of one useless character, that was literally just there to fill a space! This character reminded me of Larsa (any FFXII fans?!?!?) – Totally unnecessary (actually Larsa probably was necessary to the story of FFXII) but just seemed to have the right thing at the right time (just like Larsa's unlimited potions – ideal in battle!) with a cute smile to finish. <br/><br/>Overall, I really enjoyed the film, my qualms bring this film down a little, but I can understand that they can also be easily looked over. Most kids will LOVE this film (as did my lil bro), most people for whom Terminator and Arnie is part and parcel of their childhood, will also appreciate and enjoy this film and the hard work both the cast and crew have put into it. It's an unprecedented improvement on the last, humiliating terminator film."
"jolly_bolton","10","4","8","3 June 2009"," Such an excellent film no matter what bad stuff i heard about it...
","i think this terminator film is excellent and stands up there with the first two. the tributes paid to the last terminator films will make you remember the film, especially the one involving a character from the past films. the thing that made me love this movie was Sam Worthington. i never knew the guy before this movie, but he gives such an excellent performance in this film. Bale is excellent in this movie, not so sure about Dyllas Howard, she was very good, but not as good as worthington and bale. what i also like about this film is the fact that Connor's future father is in this movie, albeit not yet knowing he will be sent back in time to protect Sarah Connor and father john with her. such good atmosphere between Reese and Connor.<br/><br/>all in all i give this film 10/10 and don't think any other film this year will top it, other that MAYBE transformers: ROTF. this film includes action, comedy, and sadness and genuine scares now and then. make sure you watch this in the theatres because you wont get the same awesome experience on DVD or Blu-ray. Danny Elfman does a very good job with the music, although i wish Zimmer or Gregson Williams was there instead.<br/><br/>try not to watch any trailers and if you see any on an ad on TV, then turn away and block your ears, because i avoided most trailers, only having watched about 30 percent of 1 trailer, and it was worth it as this film was so thrilling and unpredictable. one moment people are talking, and next you see them running for their lives, shooting and what have you.<br/><br/>MUST WATCH MOVIE!!!! I'm telling ya people!!! this film took me by surprise as i was not expecting it to be this god considering all the negativity i heard from people who saw it in the U.S."

","The intro was awful and Danny Elfman doing the music made it sound like Batman from the beginning, so much so, that I turned to the missus and said ""this sounds like Batman"", then the music by came up and was no surprise no massive metallic terminator sign at the front intro either... but disappointing.<br/><br/>As for the film, if this is start of a new trilogy then they dived way too quickly into smashing things up... why not show us 1 hour of the missing 20 years? For me, to just jump straight into the war against the machines... don't know, just seems rushed and an excuse to show off the effects...<br/><br/>Bale is hardly in it really, and tbh, annoys somewhat, not Bale per say, more his character, who tbh, I didn't give a monkies about really... Sam Worthington on the other hand as Marcus, really shone once the character started unfolding, so thumbs up for him Helen Carter? What a waste of space and the sequence with her and Marcus talking, was ridiculous and turned it into a kids film... makes no real sense, they'd have just killed Marcus surely as he's now done his job? Effects? 8/10, sometimes very very nice, other times, BAD....<br/><br/>Nice things? Acting overall decent, decent script, Arnie CGI making an appearance... that made me smile, but is nicely done to not spoil the film...<br/><br/>However, downsides? TWO MAJOR ONES: ONE: The sequence in homage to T1 , on the stairs with the terminator coming up it and on the gantry... not sure what he was trying to do here, but it kinda made me wince...<br/><br/>TWO: The end of the fight, hot metal/cold and freeze Terminator??? Wincing again, why do what's already been done? Can see why he did both sequences BUT preferred if he hadn't: So, SCORE??? 7/10... to put it in perspective, T1 10/10 Classic, and nasty T2 9/10 Classic, slightly cheesy and made for kids T3 1/10 Abomination and should never have been made... great ending though! T4 7/10 Good attempt but overall a near miss. However, could've been a dam sight worse!"

"kunalkhandwala","8","4","8","30 May 2009"," Intense, Heart-pounding action
","The Terminator series so far has focused on one insurmountable cyborg from the future that attempts to kill John Conner, supposedly the savior of mankind in a future where machines have taken over the world. Built around that premise, 'Terminator Salvation' jumps into that annihilated future with Skynet now controlling the desolate Earth while seeking the last remnants of mankind. Droids, cyborgs and ships survey the devastation while scattered groups of humans take cover from their inevitable capture. Some have the tools and weapons but have lost the courage to fight. They survive with hope as well as fear but are being motivated by the voice of their prophesized leader whose frequent speeches on the underground radio never fail to remind them – ""If you are listening to this, you are the resistance."" John Conner, the leader of the resistance is their only hope to win the war against the machines of Skynet. His Mother died saving him and so did the good Terminator in T3 but this time, he is on his own almost.<br/><br/>Sam Worthington plays Marcus, who is sent to 2018 from the past when he had volunteered to donate his body for a cause that would change the future for mankind. The ultimate discovery of his shocking self is a revelation for him and a threat to Conner who only at a later point realizes that Marcus is not whom he perceived to be. Conner infiltrates Skynet to rescue Kyle Reese, who fathers John Conner in the past (T1). The time travel phenomenon will leave you confused at times but what the writers and director MCG have achieved is quite commendable, considering that this is the 4th installment in the series. The plot still has enough surprises and room for future exploits. <br/><br/>While Christian Bale delivers his intense, calm and reserved performance like he does in most of his movies, Saw Worthington is the one who towers above all. His performance has the versatility, intensity and promise of a rising star.<br/><br/>As a highlight, T4 has action that comes fast and heavy. There is more explosive action and gunfire than ever and barely a breather between two intense action sequences. As a result, the pulsating effect will leave your heart rate somewhere between 120-160.The machines are meaner, bigger and cause more destruction than the Incredible Hulk being on the run. Special attention must be drawn to the radical motorcycles of the machines that make the 'Batpod' look archaic. Computer graphics in most sequences are phenomenal! From the desolate landscapes of L.A. to the machines, to the fighter jets in combat, to the wormy machines and also the cameo by the original 'Terminator', the visuals are incredible.<br/><br/>MCG adds just enough franchise recognition in this film with 'I'll be back', naked Arnie and the trademark theme that evokes nostalgia and excitement as in the previous films. Yes, MCG has redeemed himself in his career as director and summer '09 has its second fun- filled, adrenalin rushing installment. <br/><br/><ul><li>8.57 on a scale of 1-10.</li></ul>"
"DICK STEEL","8","4","8","28 May 2009"," A Nutshell Review: Terminator Salvation
","For the most parts, you would have felt that McG and his team had wanted to play it safe. For starters, there are numerous elements here, from one liners to artifacts to references and events that serve as a throwback, or homage, to those seen in the earlier movies. Which is good in a way, because it reminds us that characters like John Connor (now played by Christian Bale) have come a long way and Salvation reinforces their character traits a bit more. Fans will likely have a field day with the dozen easter eggs that can be identified, and I guess that the filmmakers are trying to tell everyone that they've got a good grasp of what has happened, and to trust them in moving the franchise forward.<br/><br/>Then there's the play on you, the audience, with your back knowledge of certain events that will happen, such as Kyle Reese (Anton Yelchin) coming into the mythos in the now-future, the raging war between the humans and the machines, and how Skynet is still scheming to get rid of the leader of the Resistance, only to be a little more cunning in its methods. It's a little no brainer in picking up where T3 had left off with Judgement Day, though like John Connor's voice-over in the trailer, this is not the future he was warned about, as something's not quite right, and different from his personal expectations.<br/><br/>The setting here is not something not seen before, with post apocalyptic environments done to the death in films such as Resident Evil. But this film felt more like The Matrix Revolutions, with more cerebral potentials making way for all out action. Under McG's guidance, whom I think has taken a huge leaf from Michael Bay, Terminator Salvation brings us to that bleak sci-fi future which is pretty much void of everything, where everything that can be blown up in a fireball, will be. And the explosions get larger and more intense as it goes along, with mushroom clouds ballooning over many horizons, and with robots of all shape and sizes entering the fray. I particularly liked the lumbering T-600, the precursor to Arnie's T-800, and this film allows the witnessing of Skynet's design sophistication, knowing we're eventually going to be introduced to the later models already seen in previous films.<br/><br/>But story wise, John Connor is the franchise's Neo, or so he takes it upon himself to think. He's been brought up by his mom Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton lending her voice here), the equivalent of a Morpheus, to believe that he's the next The One, humanity's saviour from the machine world. Only that because how Skynet's assassination efforts in the future/past have been thwarted time and again (T-800, T-1000, T-X), we now face a future that could, and possibly is, a tangent of what was the original sequence. If you want to talk about a time- travel-mind-warp, this is it, since three films as chronicled skewed events that would happen in the future. Connor, to his band of rabid followers, is their messiah and prophet, as he has battled Skynet's creations before, and could predict what would be next in the assembly line. To his superiors (yes, he's not Resistance Leader), he's just lucky with his guesses, but little do they know of the Bible that he refers to - his mother's audio tapes.<br/><br/>With this belief in being The One, Connor irks the leadership more so because his primary objective in saving Reese, boils down to the fact that without Reese, his own existence will be in jeopardy, and can no longer fulfill the role he believes he will, in being the salvation of mankind. And I thought that provided an angle that would have elevated the film, if not for forgetting about Connor mid way with the focus on new character Marcus Wright (Sam Worthington), and that of the action sequences.<br/><br/>But don't get me wrong. Sam Worthington is a discovery in this film, bringing his ghost in the shell Marcus Wright into being the most tragic figure thus far in the storyline, tussling constantly between humanity, and his unknown destiny. Destiny seems to be the flavour of this year too, in reboots especially. Star Trek suggested that what will be will be, even though the journey to enlightenment will take a knock and a meander, but you'll get there. Here, we all know John Connor would be the leader of the Resistance, and we will journey with him to that stage, albeit with some kinks along the way.<br/><br/>In fact, Bale seemed to be second fiddle to Worthington's presence, but here's a warning shot - don't forget Anton Yelchin as Kyle Reese. I think he has a knack of reprising roles in long- standing franchises, with his Chekov being very well liked in Star Trek, and now his Reese bearing some similarities in mannerisms to Michael Biehn's take. I'll definitely be paying attention to this young actor as he moves Reese's character forward in future installments. And of course, the very pregnant Kate Connor (Bryce Dallas Howard, previously Kate Brewster played by Claire Danes) might spring a surprise or two later as well.<br/><br/>Am I looking forward to the next installment? Yes, to no surprise of course. Terminator Salvation, like all the reboots and remakes you have out there of well known and beloved franchises, served its purpose as being the bridging film, cementing known knowns only to gain acceptance from the audience, before boldly moving forward on its own two feet, hopefully."

","I really wanted to like this film. I truly did. I'm a big fan of the others (even the oft criticized T3), and was really looking forward to this one. I gave it some time (about 20 minutes) before the ""ughs"" came out. First of all, the writing was horrid. I felt that I was watching the equivalent of a decently made fan-film. Terminator Salvation though doesn't have the excuse of a super-low budget YouTube production. To the contrary, it has fantastic special effects and a Hollywood casting.<br/><br/>The first Terminator was, aesthetically, an influential film. Like Blade Runner, Terminator has shaped the look of Sci-Fi films following it. What's tragic about Terminator Salvation, is that it (whether the writers were conscious of it or not) stole so much from other movies: The quiet little girl was Newt from Aliens. The old lady with the long gray hair, Common's character, the Terminator machine ""fish"", and the SkyNet computer providing a sloppy explanation of the ""meaning-of-everything"" to Sam Worthington's character reminded me of items out of Matrix Reloaded.<br/><br/>There were other quirks too:<br/><br/><ul><li>The little girl was a completely expendable character in the script. She became an annoyance. She had zero impact on this film. Not to give away to much, but she does push a button at one point in the film. However, another character could have completed the task. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Sam Worthington is Australian. However, I honestly didn't realize this until about halfway into the film when his American accent slips and he sounds very, very Australian for part of a scene. This was distracting, to say the least.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The ending was completely ridiculous. However, at this point of the film it didn't matter for me, it was already a bomb.</li></ul><br/><br/>To be fair, the few things I DID like:<br/><br/><ul><li>The mega-sized Terminator with the detachable Terminator motorcycles.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The digital overlay of Arnold near the end of the film. Very impressive technical work. It was as if they brought the young Arnold of 1984 to the movie set in a time-machine.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Sam Worthington (minus the accent slip) as an actor. He did really well. As did the actor who played the Kyle Reese character.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The scene where Connor hot-wires the Terminator motorcycle. Cool scene.</li></ul><br/><br/>In short, my advice to would-be watchers of the movie is to wait for the DVD/Blu-Ray release or just re-watch T1, T2 or T3."

I never got that feeling from T3, which felt more like a rehash of everything we've already seen with a few twists thrown in. Salvation felt fresh and left me wanting more - instead of wanting it to end. The action scenes were intense and imaginative: they did the Terminator brand-name proud. Finally, it's a real treat when you get to see great acting in an action flick. Christian Bale - the dude pours himself into John Connor. It makes the myth on the screen that much more powerful.

Even though James Cameron is nowhere-really to be found in the credits, both James Cameron's heart and soul are in Terminator 4; possibly when Stan Winston passed-away, James Cameron paid a little more attention to ""his baby's"" (The Terminator 1984) third off-spring. Subconsciously James Cameron always takes us back to Harlan Ellison's ""Soldier"" (story/episode on ""The Outer Limits""); Ellison, Cameron, Winston, Gale Anne Hurd, and William Wisher are ALL genius storytellers and TERMINATOR IV would never have been as great an entry in Science-fiction without the genuine enthusiasm of the actors and entire production staff!!!!!!

","I'm not a terminator geek but I have watched the previous three and think they are great action flicks (the third may not be as great..) and so.. here we are.. fourth installment of much beloved series of robots kicking humanity in the behind because someone forgot to put a kill switch or at least Asimov 3 laws of robotic! (I'm looking at you programmers! oh and beta testers too!).<br/><br/>Decent start in introducing the characters. No real stories behind them.. i guess they expect moviegoers to know all about them before hand? nice action sequences.. a bit too much i think.. I mean do you really want to give everything up-front? with no story yet? oh they still use radio as mean of communication? was it encrypted? cool helicopter crash scene! (although unnecessary..).<br/><br/>As we go further into the movie, no real character development and more explosions! more robots of all sizes and shapes! more mind-numbing action sequences! is it too much to ask to tell us just a tiny bit info on the characters than just tossing them into random scenes and hope that we know what the hell their significance on the whole plot is? aka a bit more dialogues? no?.<br/><br/>Well.. I got what i wanted. In the form of them screaming and yelling (I guess it's their interpretation of how human will act in distress.. their only interpretation..). Still no telling what this movie all about and I have no idea who the characters are and their significance into the main plot. Speaking of plot. Is this movie about John or Marcus?.<br/><br/>Just when I think there won't be anymore wacky science on the works. Will I let a veterinarian do an open heart surgery on me? maybe.. given the circumstances. Will I let a veterinarian do an open heart surgery on me, with a donor that may not have the same blood type, with primitive equipment, in a freaking dessert? heck no .. just let me die!.<br/><br/>And so McG was kind enough to give us the morale of the story in the end. What makes us human? .. mm.. eerr.. we like explosions on top of explosions? and more explosions just.. because? I don't know. My ears are still hurting from deafening Elfman scores and my mind pretty much dead by the ridiculous plot. Oh and don't bother to encrypt your communication because even super computers in the future can't even figure out what ""we are going to attack skynet at such such hour"" means in plain English. <br/><br/>Conclusion: Good popcorn movie. Bad plot and terrible acting by extras (I know it's a small part, but I think we can do better than this. =D) dragged this movie down. 5/10."
"Hellrazr360","7","4","8","22 May 2009"," Terminator: Throwback Edition
","When watching Terminator Salvation, one can't help but get a strange sense of deja vu throughout the course of the film. This isn't so much due to the characters or the story and how it's presented, but more thanks to select scenes that at times feel thrown in for the sake of nostalgia. With that in-mind, it's easy to view this film as more of a tribute to the other Terminator films (namely the first two) more than a truly significant entry in the series.<br/><br/>Probably the film's only truly main issue is the plot itself: it just isn't that significant. Save for showing John Connor and Kyle Reese in the constantly foreshadowed future to give an idea of their characters in the setting. Really the film feels as if it's just trotting along to entertain rather than tell anything. There are a number of action scenes that come up every so often and these are the highlight of the film. From impressive special effects to very good camera shots and enough adrenaline to keep the viewer's eyes glued to the screen, Salvation manages to succeed very well in the action and entertainment aspect.<br/><br/>With regards to the film's characters, they're mostly competent but not effectively used. Sam Worthington and Anton Yelchin are the only two here who are any exceptions to this, with Worthington being the film's most likable character and the only one really close to fleshed out well enough. Anton definitely looks like he's giving his all to try and do justice to Kyle Reese after Michael Beihn superbly played him and he manages to do a surprisingly good job. However, everyone else just comes off as unremarkable and not in the least bit interesting. This isn't helpful, since Christian Bale, as with his predecessors, just can't manage to utilize the potential his character has. Granted, he's probably done the best job out of him, Edward Furlong and Nick Stahl, but even with that said he barely does anything to stand out from the crowd.<br/><br/>As mentioned before, the plot could very easily be argued as completely insignificant. Really all it does is tell part of a potentially endless series of chapters in the long war against the machines. There are also a couple questionings that one might have with the decisions made in the film in regards to the series' continuity (eg. Reese's feelings towards the Terminators in the first film a la ""it can't be bargained with...it doesn't feel pity, or remorse, or fear..."" speech don't seem to match up with him knowing Marcus in the film and, in the end, that he was a Terminator). These parts might not be glaringly obvious, but they do lead to some skepticisms with the film and its choice in progression.<br/><br/>While it might sound like I'm beating up on the film and consider it a lousy overall production this isn't the case. In fact, my expectations were quite low and the film did manage to surprise me. There's enough fun to be had with the action scenes and the film is generally entertaining despite it's flaws. The film could certainly have been a lot better and, if anything, we could've certainly done without it. So if you simply want a film that entertains and serves a bit of a tribute to its predecessors, then get in line. But if you're hoping to get a significant installment to the films plot-wise with stakes along the lines of Terminator 2, don't be surprised if you're, well, disappointed."
"prozacfan","7","4","8","22 May 2009"," Lots of noise and destruction. That's about it.
","Good action film, great special effects. The problem? It's not a very good ""Terminator"" movie. It plays out like any one of a hundred post-apocalyptic shoot-em-ups. Stock characters, minimal character development, action sequences revved up beyond belief really just for the sake of the eye-candy of the special effects, and lapses in logic (both geographic and common sense) that undermine the integrity of the story.<br/><br/>I wanted to like this film. I was VERY impressed with the CGI. But in the earlier ""Terminator"" films the effects served the story. In this film, the story exists simply to provide framework for the action set pieces and effects. Lots of frosting, very little cake.<br/><br/>And by the way, Moon Bloodgood is as smoking hot as any actress with a ridiculous professional name will probably ever be.<br/><br/>There are a few characters that exist for NO REASON AT ALL except to probably please focus groups (as in the case of the small child) or to perhaps lure in an older viewer or two who assumes that the presence of a ""serious actress"" (Jane Alexander) will lend some gravitas to the proceedings. As badly as the Skynet machines wanted to kill Connor, I wanted to erase that little kid from the movie. The kid looks like she could be another child of a certain Hollywood acting couple. This kid is given almost nothing to do, says nothing, and really just slows the film (and the characters watching out for her) down. Jane Alexander is on screen for about two minutes and is of no real consequence.<br/><br/>Plenty of ""yeah, right"" moments in this film.<br/><br/>If you can find a local theater with a huge screen and killer sound system, you will be impressed by the visuals and the deafening sound. If you are looking for a good, compelling story that doesn't take frequent liberties with logic or narrative tightness (not to mention originality -- see paragraph one) then you've come to the wrong movie."
"DonFishies","7","4","8","22 May 2009"," Not terrible, but imperfectly balanced by lots of good and bad
","Unlike the previous three films, Terminator Salvation takes place in the future well after Judgment Day has ravaged the earth. John Connor (Christian Bale) is only a member of the resistance against the machines yet, but is on the lookout for his future father, Kyle Reese (Anton Yelchin).<br/><br/>While it is not as good as The Terminator and can barely even be mentioned in the same sentence as the legendary Terminator 2: Judgment Day, Terminator Salvation is really not a bad movie. But it is not a great movie either.<br/><br/>The film does what it can to salvage the pieces of Jonathan Mostow's Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines, and for the most part, it does so valiantly. Wiping the camp and the ridiculousness of its predecessor away, Terminator Salvation settles post opening credits right into the gritty and dystopic nature of the first two films, only amped up considerably. The purely visual McG and his crew make it crystal clear that the future is bleak and depressing. Barren wastelands of deserts, dank sewer living spaces, and huge industrial spaces let the audience know they are not in for anything on the lines of escapism. While many of the set designs and features sample from more notable films (such as Mad Max and Blade Runner), there is enough desolation and despair sprinkled throughout that it manages to not feel like it is as clearly ripping off others as it is. Adding little homages to the original films was also a very nice touch.<br/><br/>The special effects and makeup are done one better. The action borders on the lunacy of Michael Bay, but manages to stay in check and at a driven pace. Watching the hundreds of explosions, and the fights between humans and terminators is something that was never really done at this level before, but the film handles it excellently. The makeup is even more astounding, and has never looked more realistic. Never once was there a question of how fake anything looked (unlike the recent X-Men Origins: Wolverine), and each effect seems to one-up the next. Some of the set pieces are eye-poppingly well done, and while nothing will ever stun the way the T-1000 still does today, some of the effects here come pretty close.<br/><br/>But these successes, in making a bombastic summer blockbuster, can only go so far.<br/><br/>The story, quite simply, is a mess. Leaving aside the continuity errors (as they have always plagued the series incessantly), the film just never gets out of the mindset of wanting to be the beginning of a franchise. Never once does it want to be its own unique work. It manages to not rely so much on the previous three films rather miraculously, but this does not work in its favour. Characters are introduced at incredible speed, but none of them (outside of Connor, whose motivations practically write themselves at this point) are given any backstory or motivation for their actions. We know they hate the machines, and we know they have all continue to persevere through horror and tragedy since Judgment Day. But that is it. We are merely given strict, one-dimensional character outlines for this crew of fighters (and at least one notable villain), but it feels like stuff was either chopped out during editing or just was not even bothered to be added in.<br/><br/>I realize that starting a franchise off is not an easy task. But if you are going to make it obvious that you plan to milk at least another two films out of this, you need to at least make an effort for people to latch onto characters that stick. If there is zero development here, then what hope is there for development in the future? It all feels so arbitrary and silly after awhile (and not helped by the cheat of an ending), that you begin to wonder why they even bothered making the film in the first place.<br/><br/>With as little as they are given, it is a little unfair to pick on the supporting cast. Bryce Dallas Howard and Common are given little else than the ability to move the plot from moment to moment. Michael Ironside, Moon Bloodgood and especially Helena Bonham Carter are interesting characters, but are never given anything really meaningful to do. Yelchin seems uneasy as Reese, and frequently appears way too immature in the integral role.<br/><br/>Bale on the other hand, is a bit underhanded. We can see that he is putting in the same intensity here that he has in every role he has ever done, but it just does not pay off the same way it did for Batman and Pat Bateman. He just never gets out of the mindset of wanting the character to be something he is not. This character was never written or intended to be at the level Bale's performance demands of it. It is always undercut, and it always feels lacking. This character may eventually fulfill a prophecy, but Bale's hokey monologues and forceful delivery of some lines is too good for what this character should have been.<br/><br/>That leaves me with Sam Worthington. I have tried to stay as far away from talking about him as I can, because he is the lifeblood of this film. The little known Worthington is an absolute marvel from start to finish. Marcus Wright is the most interesting new character, and is the best thing about the film. Worthington breathes a vivid life into every scene he is in, and is clearly where the most effort went when the script was written. He is just impossible to take your eyes off of. It is truly a shame that his key trait was spoiled by the marketing team.<br/><br/>While there is a lot to like about Terminator Salvation, there is a lot to not like as well. It is imperfectly balanced, but at least it was not terrible.<br/><br/>7/10."
"Matt_Layden","6","4","8","21 May 2009"," Sequel...Prequel....Reboot...Whatever
","The problem with this film is the same problem that the recent Wolverine film had, it just doesn't connect with the original material. Now, there could be many reasons for this, non of which the film acknowledges. In fact, the film doesn't seem to care about a lot of stuff other then blowing things up and making it look cool. This entry into the series is vastly different from the previous ones. This time around the story takes place in 'present time' I would say, since every film before that was about traveling back in time to save/kill whomever. So right off the bat the film feels like it doesn't belong.<br/><br/>Terminator Salvation is better then Rise of the Machines and weaker then the first two. There, I just told you something you probably already knew. Christian Bale is the 4th actor to portray John Conner (that's right 4th, look it up) and his performance consists of a lot of yelling and shooting. He doesn't have any scenes of emotional depth and the character loses that connectivity with the earlier films. He's a different John Connor, he's not the punk kid or the hiding from everything bum, he's finally becoming what his mother said he would be. Although, he is not the leader of the resistance yet, so this film is NOT the battles we've been preluded to in the original films, it's what happens before it. This film takes place in 2018, everything we've seen or been told came from 2029.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast, with the exception of the saving grace that is Sam Worthington, is pretty much useless. Common fades into the background and serves no purpose whatsoever, he could have been just another faceless soldier. Moon Bloodgood seems to have gotten all her scenes left on the cutting room floor. She has a romance with Worthington that comes out of nowhere because prior scenes were obviously deleted. This makes her actions seem unrealistic. Bryce Dallas Howard takes over the Claire Danes role and surprise surprise is giving nothing to do as well. Anton Yelchin surprised me as Kyle Reese, and seemed like a believable 'young' Biehn. The man who steals the show is Sam Worthington, who is actually given some emotions to play with. I found myself interested in his character and his scenes the most in this film.<br/><br/>McG has an eye for visuals, yet all his films lack substance. This is no different. Although I will say this is his best film, but when looking at his resume, that doesn't amount to much. Whatever substance this film has, it was given to by previous films. The script is basic go to point A to get plot point B. The only worthy addition to this story is the role of Marcus (Worthington) who actually brings a new dimension to this story, which in my opinion, we already know how it will turn out. I'm not totally sure on how this film stands on the whole timeline issue, but in my opinion, none of the key characters were ever at risk to me. Kyle Reese we know will go back in time, so he must live to do so. We know John Conner lives till 2029 to send Reese back in time, so we have no sense of danger in their scenes. Of course it could all be different and they could indeed die, I'm saying this based on the one line of him saying 'This is not the future my mother warned me about"".<br/><br/>It will satisfy the action junkies, but leave those who want to see a continuance of the story empty. The barren wastelands are nice to see and gives them free roam for many neat things, such as car chases, motorcycle chases, air jet chases, etc. It had a bit more Mad Max then Terminator feel. You'll see a surprise cameo, which means only one thing when someone says that about this franchise, but when you see it you might laugh. We haven't perfected this yet and it looks fake and cheesy.<br/><br/>Terminator Salvation is a popcorn flick that takes the series in a new direction. No more time traveling to save people, now it's the fight to stay alive. This new direction might not sit well with some, but for those just looking to enjoy themselves for a solid action film, this delivers. The scenes are exciting and Worthington delivers what others should have. The ending is a bit ridiculous, but it's better then the rumoured ending with the skin swapping. On a final note, Connor mentions that he's never seen anything like Marcus before, a machine covered in human skin with organs. Yet, he HAS seen this before, maybe not the organs, but he acts like this is brand new to him. Just one plot hole in my mind, in a field of many."

","Just got back from seeing this movie as was quite disappointed. The special effects where very good, but the acting was sub-par and product placement was a typical affront to the intelligent movie-goer. The story line was somewhat disjointed as well as containing continuity issues and physical impossibilities. I would hope that as movie making progresses those responsible would tone down on the special effects and concentrate more on the acting and story line to draw the viewer in. Unless of course Hollywood counts on generating revenue off of those that see this genre of movie for the special effects only in which case I will not be frequenting the Movie Theatre too often.<br/><br/>Do yourself a favor, conscious movie patron, and wait for this to come out on DVD"
"dmaletic-os","1","5","11","17 June 2009"," Emptiness of future...
",".. franchise exploitation. It is absolutely wonderful how a successful franchise can be brought down by incapable directors and story writers. T1 & T2 were very good films. Both of them gave us a good story, good acting and more then solid action and special effects (especially T2). T3 just.. felt wrong, an empty attempt to continue the saga, but T4 went all the way.. down. <br/><br/>""The future ain't what it used to be"". <br/><br/>Story lacks depth, acting is horrible, clichés are thrown all around in this sad sequel of once a great story which was masterfully launched to the screens by James Cameron. Characters lack any depth and there is nothing to connect the audience with their plight and struggle for freedom. After watching this movie, one may ask oneself ""How the hell did the Terminator in the first two movies ever even find their target"" since all they do in this movie is being target practice (or better yet ""drop-something-on-them-when-they-walk-below-it practice"")for the few characters we encounter. Also it looks like Skynet went bankrupt since there are no squads of machines sent after the rebels (unlike the future flashbacks we've seen in the earlier movies) just a few wandering machines walking around shooting without aiming (since there are no injuries or kills you can see) and what's best.. wearing some dirty old rags on them probably trying to ""blend in"" with the rebel population or just showing their individuality and personal interest in fashion. John Connors ""Win or lose, this war ends tonight"" is (although completely wrong since it is obvious that the skynet base that's destroyed at the end of the movie is not the only base skynet has) as pathetic as the last few minutes of the movie and the little speech we get.<br/><br/>Enough comments were written on the movie, so you can all get a picture of what it's like to scream in agony while watching this movie. The general recommendation is.. if you're a T1 & T2 fan.. avoid at any cost, or at least forget about what you know and what you've seen in the first two movies (T3 shares my same opinion as T4). Awful."
"leor_klier","3","5","11","7 June 2009"," not a patch on the originals
","This film just fails at almost every level.<br/><br/>The Terminators remind me of Dr Evil from the Austing Powers Films. They formulate overly elaborate easily escapable traps which results in the protagonists inevitably winning. Why not just kill your enemy as soon as the opportunity presents itself? Why play a ridiculous and intricate game of cat and mouse, when the chance for a sure victory can be attained almost immediately.<br/><br/>The seeming near invincibility of the Terminators from the first films seems to have disappeared. Now, Christian Bale appears capable of kicking a Terminator and forcing him off.<br/><br/>The sheer number of plot holes beggars belief. This being my first review (and I have been driven to write it as a result of my feeling of extreme outrage in consequence of having had to sit through what is best described as the complete bastardisation of a classic franchise), I am anxious to avoid including any spoilers, and so I won't delve any deeper into this at this point.<br/><br/>The acting is, with the exception of Michael Ironside, universally awful, and this is strange given the powerful and convincing performances we have come to expect from, in particular Christian Bale in, for example, Equilibrium and American Psycho, and Helena Bonham Carter in, well, everything.<br/><br/>Anyway, I am wary of the 1000 word limit, and as such, will end there, with a plea that Mr. McG is never allowed to direct another film until such time as I am dead and buried."

Christian Bale was so totally out of place it was unbelievable. This will go down in history as his worst role ever and he has always been one of my favourite actors. He looked too tense all the time and what the heck was his voice all about. Still, it'e been an educational experience. I have learned that you can run a fist through somebody's heart and then jump-start him again using nothing but your bare hands and two simple electrical wires. That heart can afterwards be used for heart transplant in order to save somebody's life, never mind that blood group nonsense...WTF?!?!?!? Who wrote the script, some 8 year old school dropout? The only thing that was good was special effects, other than that it was an utter and complete waste of time."
"TOMNEL","8","5","11","23 May 2009"," Very underrated. Critics have this one wrong!
","Having McG direct a Terminator movie seems as though it would be a death sentence to the franchise. Everything the guy directed was a big, extremely dumb action flick. Little more can be said for this, however it really wasn't dumb. It was just action packed. It was a bit small on the plot, but what it lacked in plot, it made up for in great action scenes, and characters that we actually care about. The Termintor series was not brought down by this one!<br/><br/>John Connor (Christian Bale), along with many others are fighting against the Skynet corporation. The Skynet's Terminators are killing all the humans in sight, and it's up to them to stop these mindless killers. Then we've got Marcus Wright (Sam Worthington). Marcus was given the death penalty, but is then mysteriously alive in 2018 after his death. He meets up with Connor's (not yet) father as a teenager, Kyle Reese (Anton Yelchin). After Kyle Reese is captured, all John Connor has is Marcus, but Marcus has a secret unbeknownst to him that causes distrust amongst the humans.<br/><br/>Critics have said many bad things about this film. They've said it was short on plot, which is somewhat true. This movie is about the war and the characters, so the plot takes place mainly on the war field. Unlike T2, there aren't a billion loopholes and plot points.<br/><br/>Critics have said the characters are flat, with no emotion. I found this movie much more emotional then possibly any of the other Terminators. Marcus is a likable, and torn character. Really, he is the hero of the film, and throughout he is distrusted. He was a great addition to the cast. He was the movie's heart. Anton Yelchin was the thinker in the movie as Kyle Reese. He uses his brain and stays calm when everyone else is going crazy. Christian Bale...well he plays Batman, or the same character anyways. He's gruff, and mean, and untrusting, like Batman. He has a heart, but he's somewhat bitter (like Batman). It seems as though Bale is typecasting himself into his own Batman role by playing the character's the same. To add the the supporting cast, we have Bryce Dallas Howard who has little to do throughout, Helena Bonham Carter who sets up and explains the film and a character, Michael Ironside as the ""by the books"" general, and Moon Bloodgood as a compassionate soldier. Even Schwarzenager himself makes an appearance through CGI and ADR as The T-800 prototype.<br/><br/>This movie was really great. The action was exhilarating and the characters were quite likable. The plot didn't need to be huge for the purpose of the film, and it wasn't. This was a great addition to the Terminator series, and on par, if not better than the third film.<br/><br/>My rating: *** out of ****. 120 mins. PG-13 for nonstop action violence and language."

On the other hand I am not going to praise this film and say it was awesome. There were parts of the film that could have gone places and then quit just short of getting there. There were also parts of this film that should have quit well before it got where it did. While the two leads did a decent job of acting their roles the rest of the supporting cast were sub-par. I especially disliked the portrayal of Kyle Reese by Anton Yelchin. Not so much as his acting was bad, just the way the role was written. I really don't want to say more as I will have to go back in and put spoiler alerts so all I will say is, at minimum, wait for a matinée so you will save a little bit of money."

And I was actually glad, that Arnold himself wasn't in the movie. Don't get me wrong I like him a lot. But Terminator can be good without him, and this movie was the proof. The CGI Arnold T800 was actually scary, and that was all the Arnold this film needed. I'm sad that Cameron decided to ignore this masterpiece, and that so many people seem to hate it."

Compared to a similar film like ""War of the Worlds,"" where the machines controlled by aliens are taking the humans like cattle, there's a sheer intensity and determination of Cruise's character to rescue his daughter along with the quality action. I got absolutely nothing but annoyance out of the Kyle Reese and Star characters. Yelchin can act I've seen it, but half his screen time's spent yelling STAR! STAR! .... Worthington's character's story line's superb and the moment John gets him to look down and see that he isn't human, the highlight of the film. All the various machines and battles terrific and Bale and Worthington excellent."

Its loud, fast, loaded with CGI, a bit of Road Warrior, a bit War of the Worlds and a bit Transformers with ginormous OTT terminator machines (they were terrible.) <br/><br/>Less Christian Bale than I expected after all that media hype and press surrounding him. He was actually kind of a secondary character. I enjoyed Marcus's storyline and Sam Worthington's portrayal of him. He doesn't know what he is but come on, this is meant to be a big twist but not really, its more the anti-twist. What did he think happened to him on death row after he signed his body over to Skynet and woke up in the future? Blah. <br/><br/>Enjoyed seeing Sarah Conner on tapes. I liked the tie ins to the original story very much. I also enjoyed Anton Yelchin as Kyle Reese, portraying one of my favourite heroes of all time from the original Terminator ...sigh...Anton."
"bowmanblue","7","2","3","11 December 2017"," Could have been so good
","Ever since Kyle Reece explained to Sarah Connor what the future would look like when the machines ruled the Earth, Terminator fans have been desperate to see more of those dark, gritty, laser-filled scenes that James Cameron dropped into the first two movies. Now, we finally get to see a whole movie showing us what the future world would look like. And it basically looks about as much as James Cameron's original vision as Christian Bale looks like Edward Furlong, not bothering to retain either the look or feel of what has gone before.<br/><br/>'Terminator: Salvation' is the film that fans asked for, but didn't ask for the way they got it. While it was made, the Terminator himself was busy running the state of California, so couldn't really reprise his role (and don't get me started on any CGI work used to correct this – it really isn't up to the 'Rogue One' standards we're now used to). However, that's not so bad, as the story isn't just about the indestructible machine of metal, but also the Connor family, so most people were relieved that a decent actor like Christian Bale was going to be playing John Connor. Unfortunately, the film takes the weird route not to follow him, instead choosing to be mainly about Sam Worthington's character – a death-row inmate who somehow wakes up in the future and also helps trash a cyborg or two. I won't spoil too much of Worthington's character, especially as the trailer basically did that for me. However, I will say that this film would have been a damn sight better if it simply omitted his character completely. I'm not having a go at the actor. He did all he could with what he was given. It's just people weren't going to watch this film based on ANY new character – they wanted to see more of the old ones (even if they had been recast!).<br/><br/>I could pick out various personal annoyances that I had with this film – the helicopter pilot who wears sunglasses at night, the silent child who's used as a plot device to show how caring our central characters are, or the fact that the end battle completely rips off T2 beat for beat. All of these I could have overlooked if it wasn't for the fact that 'Salvation' completely ignores various plot points that have been clearly stated in previous films. Maybe those not so 'up# on Terminator lore won't notice, but for me I found myself asking too many questions as to why things were happening this way. I know you could say that timelines got changed here and there so things are now different in the future, but, in my opinion, that's just lazy writing and a cop out.<br/><br/>There were at least a couple of stand-outs, namely Ashton Yelchen's excellent take on how Michael Biehn portrayed Reece, Skynet City looking pretty cool and the nod to T"" by playing Guns and Roses again. However, this film was almost damned before it was released as much of the publicity surrounding it was directed at Christian Bale's bizarre outburst on set at a fellow crew member.<br/><br/>I guess that 'Terminator: Salvation' isn't as bad as I'm making out. It's an okay sci-fi/action film. However, because it has the Terminator name attached we – the fans – are just hoping for more than we got. And, if you're interested, you may want to Google it's alternate ending, as it is much darker and interesting than what we got."

Of course, they couldn't resist throwing in the famous lines, ""Come with me if you want to live"" and ""I'll be back!""

"khanbaliq2","5","2","3","9 August 2015"," Terminator Salvation is a visual treat with thrilling action.
","Too bad I didn't see this film in a theater when it was released back in 2009. For me this is the most enjoyable Terminator film since James Cameron's last effort in 1991. The reason for this is the absence of Arnold Schwarzenegger in Terminator Salvation. In addition, the filmmakers dared to try new things, resulting in an interesting, entertaining and gritty film. Schwarzenegger, a great presence in the first two Terminator films, should have left the role of the T-800 when he became old. This is my opinion. This would have resulted in better sequels or reboots after James Cameron stopped making Terminator films. Schwarzenegger's presence requires screenwriters to construct a plot revolving around his T-800, and this has resulted in two repetitive and average cash-grabs titled Terminator 3: Rise Of The Machines (2003) and Terminator Genisys (2015). This problem is especially clear in Genisys, for which, instead of trying something new, the screenwriters (Laeta Kalogridis and Patrick Lussier) delivered a poorly-written and confusing screenplay because Schwarzenegger, who's 68 years old now, agreed to return. As a result, we got an ""old but not obsolete"" good Terminator, yet another attempt to prevent Judgment Day, an evil John Connor (something that I really didn't like), and an overstuffed plot with unimaginative details and possible plot holes. Well, Genisys was just another uninspired attempt to make money, however, I still enjoyed the film despite its faults, and I recommend seeing it. Schwarzenegger is no longer the box office draw that he used to be in the 1980s and 1990s, but Emilia Clarke is definitely a good screen presence. And so, Terminator Salvation doesn't have this 'Arnold problem.' It introduces new characters, and further develops established characters like John Connor. On second thought, Connor has little or no character development in this film, but it's still good to see him. We also get to see the future in 2018, after Judgment Day. For the most part, the designers and special-effects technicians did an excellent job creating the robots, vehicles and buildings. Though there are some missteps when we get to see Skynet headquarters. The action scenes that one expects from a film like this are mostly exciting and even original. The images are memorable as well, be it a nuclear explosion, a ruined city, a big deadly Terminator, or an apocalyptic wasteland. Because of all this, Terminator Salvation really deserves to be called a science fiction action film. On the downside, the screenplay by John Brancato and Michael Ferris is unfocused and rather simple. One can say that there are two main characters, but neither one gets enough development. The exploration of human nature that was present in James Cameron's films is absent. But at least the dialogue is fine, for the most part. Director McG can be applauded because he knew what he wanted this film to be like, and he followed through with his vision, resulting in a film that's epic, enjoyable and a bit disturbing. So, I definitely recommend Terminator Salvation. It has its faults, but it does not, as Arnold said, s*ck. It rules."

","Although this movie is not the best terminator, its OK.

","Upon seeing the trailer of Terminator Salvation, I wasn't expecting too much of this movie. When I checked out Terminator Salvation, I was right. Terminator Salvation has been reduced to a popcorn movie thanks to director McG (Charlie's Angels). Though there are various homages and references to the previous Terminator movies and we finally get a look at what the world is like post-Judgement day, it still lacks the heart and soul of its predecessors.<br/><br/>Terminator Salvation takes place in a post-apocalyptic 2018. Christian Bale takes over from Edward Furlong and Nick Stahl as John Connor, now a soldier who is living up to the expectations set by his deceased mother. He still carries tapes of his deceased mother Sarah Connor (an uncredited Linda Hamilton) and the future of mankind weighs heavily on his shoulders. At the same time, Marcus Wright (Sam Worthington) who was a prisoner on death row who was executed in 2003 but has since been resurrected as a cyborg sent to infiltrate the human resistance. Before Marcus was executed, he agrees to donate his body for a secret project led by an ex-Cyberdyne Systems scientist Dr. Serena Kogan (Helena Bonham Carter). Along the way, Marcus is assisted by a young survivor Kyle Reese (Anton Yelchin who is channeling a young Michael Biehn from the 1984 Terminator) and a mute girl Star (Jadagrace Berry). When Skynet prepares a final attack to wipe out mankind, John Connor rallies the remaining survivors to unite and launch an all out assault on Skynet. John Connor must also contend with General Ashdown (Michael Ironside ), the current leader of the Resistance.<br/><br/>It was great to see a cameo of a CGI-Arnold Schwarzenegger as the original Terminator. There were plenty of great homages and references to The Terminator (1984) and Terminator 2: Judgement Day (1991) which saves the movie from being a total disappointment. It's clear that McG was not the right choice for the Terminator franchise as he has reduced Terminator Salvation to a popcorn movie. While I acknowledge that James Cameron is an unbeatable act to follow, surely a better director could have been picked. Perhaps McG should have studied James Cameron's methods as to what made the Terminator movies so successful. Another pet hate of mine is watering down the violence to attract a wider audience. The Terminator movies have a reputation for being violent. Full stop. Don't water the subject matter down just to attract a wider audience, otherwise you risk alienating a lot of loyal fans. The fear factor that was present through Terminator and Terminator 2 is gone. Instead, you have kids fighting in the war.<br/><br/>Terminator Salvation was also (in)famous for a controversial incident involving Christian Bale profanity-laden spray directed at cinematographer Shane Hurlbut which was recorded and leaked onto the internet. Christian Bale has since apologised to Shane Hurlbut and also made a public apology for his inexcusable behaviour.<br/><br/>That aside, though Terminator Salvation wasn't the best of the Terminator franchise. It wasn't that bad of a movie compared to other sequels that are considered the worst, however it wasn't that memorable. It's enough to pass the time.<br/><br/>6/10."
"kaustubhm","8","2","3","5 September 2013"," Why so serious?
","at the outset, let me be clear that I am not a fan of action movies. I have enjoyed some from that genre once in a while, the first Die Hard, the first two Terminators, the first Matrix, The Avengers.. and that's that. I hated the second Die Hard, the third Terminator, the later Matrix movies, was bored with the Spiderman movies etc etc. But I loved Salvation.<br/><br/>Having proverbially been living on Mars for the past few years, I have missed the Sarah Connor Chronicles. I haven't seen any of the Transformer movies (wanted to note this, since some reviewers have compared the giant robots to those from that universe. With that background, let me reiterate - I loved this one.<br/><br/>Maybe I haven't been exposed to many of the other technically slick recent movies, and maybe that's why I enjoyed the action sequences in this one so much. Perhaps I found the giant machine bots in this one a massive improvement over the last time I had seen their ilk on screen (that was in that ridiculous third Matrix movie). The moto-terminators were a joy too. I enjoyed the chase sequences, the camera inside the crashing helicopter when John Connor tries to take off with it, and the finale too. The signature homages to the previous Terminator movies showed up at the right times too. I was thoroughly impressed with the post-apocalypse (""dystopian"" I think is what I want to say) depiction. I found the performances of especially the two leads - Christian Bale and Sam Worthington - quite appropriate. Moon Bloodgood, Anton Yelchin, Common and of course Jadagrace also left an impression. Some of the subtle notions and character building scenes were artfully done - I particular enjoyed the early relationship development between Marcus and Kyle+Star..<br/><br/>In short, I don't know why so many people hate this movie so much. I didn't even get to watch it on the big screen and still was thoroughly entertained, having happened upon a late nighter on a movie channel here, and was planning to watch while testing some programs that would have taken an hour or so to run. They ran, and were forgotten. Salvation kept me hooked, and I always stop surfing to this day when I hit upon it being telecast somewhere. <br/><br/>Thanks McG. Hope you get to do the next in this franchise."
"stitch-99","6","2","3","25 March 2011"," It has some problems, but it's not bad.
","I enjoy the Terminator franchise. I like T1. I really like T2. To a lesser degree, I like T3 and TS, but I still like them. Before anyone asks, I haven't actually watched a full episode of the Sarah Conner Chronicles, so I don't have an opinion.<br/><br/>I don't fully understand why this movie got the negative press that it did. I was entertained.<br/><br/>First, let me discuss what didn't quite add up. The biggest problem for me is actually one that I haven't heard very much. A plot point of the story is that Kyle Reese has been targeted by Skynet, which of course spells trouble for John Conner since he has to send Kyle back in time or he won't exist. The problem: no explanation is given for Skynet to want Kyle terminated. In fact, the story would have worked better if he just happened to be captured by Skynet and John set out to rescue him because it would answer why Skynet doesn't actually kill him.<br/><br/>The movie has no real focus until the third act. There are several story lines going on, but none of them emerges as the main conflict until the final part when they all unify. This is more of a minor thing, but it annoyed me nonetheless.<br/><br/>This adds very little to the story arc of the franchise. Again, I haven't heard this one very often. Think about it. How much is actually accomplished in this story that affects the rest of the series? John meets Kyle (but not until the end), John gets more pull in the Resistance (which wasn't even a concept until this movie, so it just created its own problem for John to overcome), and John's attitude towards machines lightens up (admittedly, this is cool because it sets up for his reprogramming of the T-800 from his youth). That's it. That's not enough for a movie of this length.<br/><br/>A better situation would have been for the base at the end be the mainframe that John destroyed in the future which was so pivotal in the war and caused Skynet to want to terminate him. By simply doing this, the entire story is building up to that and thus has purpose in the overall series.<br/><br/>Huh. Anyway, this actually wasn't a bad movie. The acting was good, the story (beyond the weak points I noted) was good, and the special effects were good (though I really don't care). I would recommend that you check it out for yourself if you haven't seen it and don't listen to the naysayers."

","I don't often review movies but I'd like to make some remarks about this one. The first Terminator is a classic. Even taken out of it's genre, it's one of the best movies ever made. The second does not drop the baton and is wonderful action cinema. The third's OK but we've seen it all before. And so to the forth. Christian Bale and the war we all want to see. Our hopes are up. But no. Christian Bale goes through the motions and could be replaced by any regular action star. Sam Worthington? Where did he come from exactly? One minute he's nobody, next he's starring in everything. For me, he just doesn't have screen presence. And the war? Well, we seem to have missed most of it. My main gripe, where's the FUN gone? ""I'll be back"", ""That is SO you"", ""Easy Money"". Come on, everyone knows these great lines. There's not a single one liner in the whole mess. Nothing to raise a smile. Connor even had the opportunity the say 'Easy Money' but it was missed. The whole franchise has disappeared up it's own backside like The Matrix and Aliens did. Ill thought out concepts and bad story telling. It's so full of holes I'm not even going' near the plot. Even some of the effects are a bit rough. The Terminator deserved so much more. It was tough but they managed to kill it in the end."
"Nyx_Selene","6","2","3","29 October 2010"," I like it, but I can't help noticing
","This fourth installment in the ""Terminator"" series tells the tale of how John Connor meets Kyle Reese, as well as the story of accidental (?) murderer Marcus Wright, who is executed in 2003, but somehow wakes up in 2018, unknowing of why, how or of what has happened to him. In the ruins of Los Angeles, he is saved from a T-600 by Kyle Reese and the mute girl Star, and after that joins them. By accident they overhear a radio broadcast from John Connor, and decide to find him, to join the resistance.<br/><br/>They find a filthy gas station filled with cowards, and while there, the Terminator answer to the Iron Giant finds them. Mysteriously, no one hears it coming, leading to it being lovingly nick-named ""the Sneak-o-bot"" among my friends. Once it's broken through the roof, it starts making one hell of a lot of noise, though. The robots have that going for them: They only make a sound when they're on-screen.<br/><br/>Some action later, Kyle and Star are taken by Sneaky, and Marcus joins resistance pilot Blaire, heading back to HQ and Connor. He earns her trust by taking out a gang of rapists threatening her. However, HQ is surrounded by magnetic mines, and when they cross the minefield, a mine goes bang. *gasp* Turns out, Marcus is a Terminator, too. Only he didn't know he was.<br/><br/>The rest of the movie is to no surprise about Connor and Marcus working together to free Kyle from Skynet.<br/><br/>Now, to what I can't help noticing: It seems Marcus is only absurdly strong when he knows that he's a robot. Remember the firefighter that couldn't even budge the T-800 in ""Terminator 3""? Marcus throws a T-800 around like a beach ball, but somehow manages not to maul the rapist gang to bits during their fight.<br/><br/>Every terminator in the movie is explicitly trying NOT to kill Connor and Kyle. Every robot Connor encounters seems fully satisfied with throwing him around a bit. It is made clear in the movie that the order is to kill both of them, so how hard could it actually be to just grab their necks and squeeze? The robots have so many chances of killing them both that it's ridiculous, but none of them do. Well, except for the last one, who runs a metal bar through one of Connor's lungs, so that Marcus can nobly offer up his own heart and die. (What, you think there's another reason? Do tell.) I thought a heart transplant required finding a perfect match regarding blood and tissue types and then post surgery going through a special diet and eating medicine to prevent the body from rejecting the new heart, but I guess Marcus is the organ donor equivalent of the one-size-fits-all garment. Otherwise, putting his heart into John Connor would be about as effective as shoving a T-800 fuel cell in there.<br/><br/>By now, I guess you think I pretty much loathe this film, but I actually like it. I can watch it over and over again, even if I can't put my finger on the reason why. It's predictable, and the script leaves a few things to be desired, but it's pretty well made, rather well cast, the action is okay and the scenery and special effects are good. The often ominous score is very much fitting, and composed by one of my personal favorites, Danny Elfman.<br/><br/>All in all, entertaining."

The acting, writing, and characters are extremely sparse. Almost every character is about as two dimensional as a piece of cardboard and Sam Worthington acts about as good as one. This makes three action epics that he has starred in that have been a complete waste of time (Clash of the Titans, Avatar{sorry, it sucks}). For some reason instead of focusing on John Connor, who should be the main character of the movie, the filmmakers decided to focus on a ridiculous terminator who thinks he's human storyline.<br/><br/>During most of the action scenes you can't tell what is going on, and when you can they don't make no sense. The entire climax of Terminator Salvation is one of more unrealistic and plot hole filled sections of any move in recent memory.<br/><br/>Hollywood needs to stop making Termiator movies; it is completely ridiculous and the story ended with Terminator 2. The third movie was just a carbon copy of 2 with a female robot, this one is a complete mess and five will be even worse.

"trpr_x","4","2","3","1 May 2010"," Subpar, lacks scope and a sense of urgency.
","Terminator Salvation had so much promise but delivered so little that it left fans of the franchise wondering ""WTF just happened here?""<br/><br/>The epic battle between man and machine is the core element of this movie franchise and I felt no scope or sense of urgency from the resistance or its leader John Conner. The previous three films built this movement against the machines as humanity's last hope, and John Conner's survival of utmost importance. Yet every time we witness a battle between Skynet and humanity there is never more than a handful of Terminators engaged at a time. Many of the battles had fewer than 5 or 6 enemies engaged at any given time and in taking an informal inventory I count maybe a dozen machines on screen throughout the film. In the final assault on Skynet Central in San Francisco we see John Conner infiltrate the installation in a series of 30 second cut scenes and his only encounter is an inept T-600 who has less competency than an Imperial Stormtrooper. Here is Skynet's HQ and we see one turret through the Marcus sub-plot, a few automated construction vehicles and one T-600, AND THAT""S IT?!? Where are the thousands of Terminators that this complex is capable of producing? We're well into the war and Skynet should have legions of Terminators out and about yet we only see one on the premises? C'mon!! We were never treated to a truly epic battle that would have given us a scope of what the resistance was facing. I believe this was a simple matter of economics. The powers that be just did not want to spend the money to do this lest it threaten their bottom line.<br/><br/>And what about the resistance? All we saw of them was a few humans scattered around the globe huddled around their radios waiting for Mr. Conner to blather on about the war. Nothing inspirational, no underlying code to initiate maneuvers against the machines, just a monotone rant on how ""they are the resistance."" After the previous 3 films I was expecting a little more from the resistance that what I was given.<br/><br/>This movie was a prime opportunity for the film maker, and the franchise, to really flesh out the war between man and machine, the struggle for humanity's survival. A stage to witness epic battles, where resistance fighters face insurmountable odds and, through HUMAN ingenuity, find a way to prevail. We never really get to see the scope of what the resistance faced on a daily basis. All we saw were a few encounters with a handful of Terminators and that was it. The Matrix films set the bar for the man vs. machine scenario in modern film making and that bar was completely ignored in this case. There was more scope and a sense of urgency in Kyle Reese's dream(nightmare)flashback in the original Terminator then there was throughout this film.<br/><br/>I have a feeling that the Hollywood ""machine"" wanted a huge return on a minimal investment. They were banking on the fan base of this franchise to carry them to the bank. Why else would they go with a music video director, very few CGI sequences and no epic battle scenes to set the tone of what the resistance faces? Given the state of Hollywood today, where originality has disappeared and the quick return is the mantra, it's no surprise this movie didn't live up to its expectations. This franchise deserves the attention to detail and storytelling that James Cameron breathed into it instead of this underfunded, community college filmmaker's interpretation of it."

From the evidence, it seems, certainly released in the summer and starring big Hollywood names, made for complete profit and once again, the brilliance of Cameron's original ideas sadly comes crashing down.<br/><br/>Not that it seems that way when the film opens. Sam Worthington's character is sat in a prison cell with a brilliantly miserable Helena Bonham Carter and as the film moves forward there is anticipation to what Marcus is going in for.<br/><br/>As the film shifts to present day warfare between man and machines, year 2018, we get out first glimpse of the new John Connor. Adopting a Cameron technique the camera pans from feet to head as Connor gets off a plane and mounts a carefully manned scheme to investigate their surroundings with humans stored underground. The shaky camera style adds some wonderful realism, giving that edge of excitement and unknowing to proceedings and it seemed McG had hit the nail on the head, and yet after this first initial stage, all becomes irrelevant as the film cascades into mediocre popcorn triviality.<br/><br/>Such as when this particular scene ends you will notice there is nothing but high stakes action junkie sequences along with a plot that, come the end, has not moved anything forward at all. Honestly if you have not watched this film yet you will hardly believe that practically 80% of this 2009 release has action orientation. There are big robots that shoot bikes out of their legs (no that's not a joke) there are squid monsters (why would humans build them?) there is slight continuity in the flying ship things and the treadmill style robots from T3 but, why? The first film blossomed on its usage of simple T101 models and whilst there was an explanation in the second film it didn't feel the need to glorify itself on special effects to demonstrate the size of its gigabyte hard-drive.<br/><br/>There is little meaning in the plot aside from the action as the resistance continue to find a solution to the finale of the war but all the dialogue seems to build towards something and as it turns out there is a consequence and it all blows into a ridiculous conclusion that given all the action and scientific futuristic elements, comes down all humane and dramatic on us, expecting us to shed tears and sympathise with a Connor who is more Dark Knight than human's war leader and a trivial inevitable love fling that is inevitable and somehow ridiculous.<br/><br/>Through all its, albeit impressive, visuals there is an underlining story of attempted survival that feels inadequate and repetitive.<br/><br/>Personally, I feel the Terminator should have ended in 1991 but as long as we have computers and machines, there will be many more."

","The fourth instalment of the Terminator franchise sets us directly in the post Judgment Day world of tomorrow (2018 to be exact), where John Connor (Christian Bale) is forging on as the destined leader of the human resistance against Skynet's robotic army of Terminators. The appearance of the mysterious Marcus Wright (Sam Worthington) seemingly alters the future in which Connor was lead to believe, an uncertain outlook which leads both Connor and Wright into the heart of Skynet to save a vulnerable Kyle Reese (Anton Yelchin) and uncover Skynet's secrets to take them down permanently.<br/><br/>Off the bat, let it be known that I am a massive fan of this franchise. Hell, I even think Terminator 3 had some strong points (some). With that being said, I found the above synopsis incredibly hard to write. Why? Well, there isn't that much of a story to write about. Don't think I'm saying that as a bad thing though. On the contrary, I walked into the theatre to see pretty much one thing, robots getting blown the sh*t up.<br/><br/>I got my wish. Although the 'family friendly' rating severely limits the amount of violence shown, especially against humans, an 'M' rating apparently allows to let rip on cybernetic humanoids to no end. So I guess ratings are based on violent behaviour against living creatures and not kick ass robots.<br/><br/>In many ways, this movie could not possibly fail. How the hell can you fail an epic war of man versus machine? There is a rule of cool that renders that impossible. With that being said, all we have with this movie is one action packed scene jumping to another with minimal cohesion. The sets pieces are amazing, powerfully gritty and yet frustratingly stupid when you think about it. These Terminators, these 'killing machines', sure do have a hard time doing the one thing that they are programmed to do. It almost seems that whenever they have a chance to actually terminate, they will instead play with their food, throw it around a bit, and basically stall until our indestructible heroes can find a way through.<br/><br/>For the first time in memory, Christian Bale seems to be half-assing this one, with this version of John Connor, although thoroughly intense, painfully one-dimensional and overshadowed (two times running now, thank you Heath Ledger) by Worthington's mysterious Wright (slipping accent aside) and an amazing performance by Yelchin, who channels Michael Biehn's Reese to the last mannerism. The rest of the cast is decent if forgettable, with Bloodgood's Blair Williams getting the most, dubious though it may be, character development, and a role for personal favourite Michael Ironside.<br/><br/>Fans of the franchise, die-hard or casual, are sure to pick up on the many throwbacks to the previous films, from catchphrases, to full lines of dialogue, to John Connor receiving his facial scars that we have seen in the previous incarnations' flashbacks. As you would expect the sound is pumping, with shrapnel flying all round through the adequately plotted pacing and extraordinary action sequences. The one place where this movie fails on a tremendous scale for me was the cheesy and lame (yes, simultaneously) epilogue, which features a baffling and unnecessary sacrifice on behalf of one of our major characters.<br/><br/>As far as summer blockbusters are concerned, this could be a lot worse. There's enough excitement on show for the average punter as well as enough references to the previous films for fans to sink their Uzi's into. Only an insane person would watch this expecting anything more than just a dumb, loud ride which ditches the story of this war to actually just show it. It's not so much of ruining the franchise, as I have read, but more a continuation of a story spawned from far superior origins. At least no one said 'Talk to the hand'.<br/><br/>And McG is still a douche.<br/><br/>Fully flawed, yet utterly entertaining. Nowhere near the perfection that is the magnificent original two, but it's an easy, yet frustrating, couple of hours of robot carnage. Enjoyable, brainless fun."

The special effects are very impressive and the bleak scenery and derelict buildings really add a sense of despair, and convey the prolonged war between Skynet and man. Christian Bale and Sam Worthington do a good job with their characters, and Bale for what it is worth is the perfect actor to fulfill the role of John O'Connor.<br/><br/>At points the editing, or screenplay is not altogether coherent, and gets frustrating (particular how past events are not explained) but I can just about forgive this and, although I had to grit my teeth the introduction of a special effects laden Arnold Schwarnegger.<br/><br/>Okay, Terminator Salvation is too much action and not enough depth and characterisation but it has a mild emotional impact and is an enjoyable film to watch."

","Well the movie It's not that bad, in fact It's entertaining, but even thought you can find good actors (not necessarily good performance) and art direction I didn't feel the plot fill what you think the mythology has to achieve, in the end too predictable.<br/><br/>I believe they thought about getting back the franchise and make more sequels, so they said ""Let's not do something that good in this one so that we can produce three more and make more money""<br/><br/>And on the other hand having watched the unfortunately cancelled The Sarah Connor chronicles, You see the difference between an interesting and well developed story arc and a poor one, it's really a shame this show wasn't renewed, and had a short life because it really was taking the story to a direction worth to see it, and not just any action movie repeating it self over and over.<br/><br/>Anyway if you are fan you got to see this one and make your own conclusions, I guess It could be worst, but I don't feel like seeing more, only if they take back The Sarah Connor chronicles someday."
"jangomac72","7","2","3","20 June 2009"," OK but should've been far better
","The year is 2018 and a mysterious stranger awakens in a world devastated by nuclear war. He searches for John Connor, a fighter in the Human resistance against Skynet, the intelligent AI that waged war on mankind and brought it to the brink of extinction many years ago.<br/><br/>The fourth film in the Terminator series is a competent action blockbuster but lacks any visual excitement or drama for the most part. It's an empty vacuous emotionless summer film that has become all too common in the last ten years or so. And, as always with these things, the fault lies not with the execution (McG does an amiable job with what he's given) but with the script.<br/><br/>It starts intriguingly in 2003 and introduces us to death row prisoner Marcus Wright who is persuaded to donate his body to medical science. However this would be an intriguing start if it wasn't for the fact that the mystery surrounding our new character was blown during promotion for the film in one of the trailers. And it's because of this I think the film lacks tension and drama and is one of its failings. Most of us will be aware that Marcus Wright is a hybrid Terminator going into the film so when the revelation comes halfway through for John Connor it has no impact whatsoever. Now admittedly it's very hard to keep anything a secret with the Internet these days. Spoilers abound everywhere and it's difficult not to know about a movie before you go and see it. But when the success of your film hangs on a major plot development twist like this then you're smartest thing is not to reveal the twist in a trailer. Sure the fanboys may leak it on a few internet sites but you don't blow your major plot point to the general public. And as a result of the cat being let out of the bag, the mystery just isn't there to engage the audience.<br/><br/>Another failing of the script (one all too common among blockbusters) is that you don't care for the main characters. John Connor should be a man laid heavy by the burden of being prophesied the saviour of mankind and frustrated at not being taken seriously by the Resistance command but they waste that aspect of the character and fail to capitalise on that concept, Bale just seems to be doing his gruff angry voice routine once again. Bryce Dallas Howard is wasted as Kate Connor, John's wife who is expecting their child. In fact it's not even mentioned in the film that she's pregnant, just shown. The couple have little contact and little chemistry in their scenes together. You should feel for them as they struggle to come to terms with bringing a child into this world but its wasted. The rest of the resistance are the usual bunch of cyphers but even less interesting, even the much praised Moon Bloodgood has little to do and little screen time.<br/><br/>It seems like I've tore apart this film but there are plus points. Anton Yelchin is absolutely fantastic as a young Kyle Reese (and virtually unrecognisable from his comedy Chekov in Star Trek), Sam Worthington does a good job of looking confused and the bit with the Arnie T-800 is very cool. The gritty production design also can't be faulted.<br/><br/>However a Terminator film set during the future war should be a rip roaring roller coaster ride of a movie. It should be like the Universal Studios attraction T2-3D but larger, bolder, more brutal and brasher with added character, you should be able to care for the hero not just watch him idly go about his gung ho business. Instead we have a washed out, bleached look of a film that dictates that you should have a huge explosion on the screen every 15 minutes or so.<br/><br/>It should've been so much better 7/10"
"edwardrevans","6","2","3","18 June 2009"," Not bad for a Music Video Producer
","Now some of the critics are slating this, why ? well I think its because they don't like the following.. <br/><br/>1.The Director/Producer has a silly name 2.McG comes from a background making Music Videos so he shouldn't be making movies.<br/><br/>Well get over it and comment on the film on its own merits.<br/><br/>The premise of this movie is to bring John Conner and his father together in one place so they can be terminated together this ensures that Kyle cannot travel back in time nor can john send him back. OK so the old Time Parodox is ""well we will kill Kyle and then John won't exist"" but John does exist in the future so the machines need to make sure they kill two birds with one stone. The machines do this by getting an infiltrator which is an Human Robot hybrid, who in a previous life was executed on death row and donated his body to Cyberdyne, step in Marcus. Marcus thinks he's human and acts human in every way expect his virtually indestructible. He wakes up in the future confused and disorientated and makes his way to the city where he meets and befriends Kyle Reese, who in turn decide to find John Conner after hearing his radio Broadcast.<br/><br/>The action sequences in the movie are in the style of Mad Max and Die Hard movies, and exciting to watch. The Terminators themselves are easy to dispatch as they are early pre T800 models. There are things wrong with the film i.e John's wife's unexplained pregnancy and a bit of dodgy camera work.<br/><br/>Nods to the previous movies in the Franchise are a plenty including using the soundtrack from T2 and I'm sure that a nod to the Great Escape got in there as well on more than one occasion.<br/><br/>As for the Acting I've never seen an Bale film before so I can't judge his performance, but I think the strong parts in it were Marcus and Kyle.<br/><br/>As for Arnie fans, he pops up in Cgi and is convincing we know its CGI but it still works."
"Janibal","Null","2","3","16 June 2009"," Interesting and quite unique prequel/sequel hybrid that catches a lot from the epic terminator magic
","Oh man, how long have we been waiting for this: Finally a movie set entirely in the ""Terminator future"" only hinted at in the previous installments by extremely dark, depressing and apocalyptic flashbacks. And let's face it, there is huge potential in exploiting these rather cool sequences. And I think McG did a rather good job on this. So many tie-ins, cool moments and nods to the original saga indicate that the director treated the franchise with all due respect and created a worthy homage while giving it some interesting new drifts as well. Anyhow, with so much back story to build upon, he quite naturally and obviously had a hard time to tie everything together logically, inevitably leading to some flaws. One of the main weak points in the plot is the ""awareness"" of the machines of Kyle Reese, not exactly logical, even worse is the fact that they do not kill him while having more than one opportunity to do so. To make matters worse, John Connors speech near the end of the movie indicating that Kyle Reese is the sole purpose for him to enter the Skynet facility is just too over the top and not quite appropriate, why the hell would any resistance member know that the future depends on John's/Kyle's survival and act accordingly?? Just mentioning the dozens to hundreds human prisoners wouldn't only have more than sufficed but also be much more believable than just screaming ""we'll all be dead"" without indicating any apparent reason. Something else the movie lacked a little were ""real"" mass future fight scenes (like in the opening of T2), mostly, just some single Terminator machines are shown wrecking havoc, which together with the rather clear skies and still surprisingly green vegetation in some places account for the apocalyptic future to appear a little ""brighter"" than indicated in the flashbacks from the first movies. I also think the first script variant of the movie would have been very interesting, to have John killed and Marcus take his skin, the scene where the T800 impales John still hints to that, since it clearly looks like an epic and dramatic death scene. Moreover, the almost ""cheesy"" heart exchange in the end felt suspiciously like a quick filler for a sudden script change. But for such a different and very depressing ending, the whole movie should have been scripted differently, namely placing Marcus and John on their own for the majority of the plot, struggling through the war, growing accustomed to each other with John discovering Marcus to be a machine much later (how the hell did they shoot the machine parts into him anyway, stolen from the Weapon X program? :-) and Marcus embracing his humanity due to looking up to John. I think this would have really improved and added to the movie and putting it en par with the (easily strongest) second installment of the franchise, but the movie as it is still delivers an epic action story with a decent amount of depth and proves worthy of the great terminator saga, unlike the rather disappointing third part, which was essentially a weaker remake of T2 (with a quite good and bold ending for the time and occasionally solid and amusing action scenes, that is)."
"coop720","7","2","3","13 June 2009"," Definitely a credible film
","I just saw this film tonight and really enjoyed the whole experience. And yes, I have seen the previous movies and am a huge fan of 1 and 2. And yes, I do know what I'm talking about when I say this is a good movie.<br/><br/>But yes, anyway, I found this movie a very credible tribute to the series (much better than T3 anyway!) I feel if I am rating it 8/10, I should give 8 valid points to why I did.<br/><br/>Good Points:<br/><br/><ul><li>CGI and Models: I found it all very professional and definitely added to the whole experience. I also enjoyed the models all used, which shows the creators were ready to tribute James Cameron. - Action: Very action-packed and thrilling; definitely a big feature of it. - Writing: Some of the writing was very good in it towards the end and I enjoyed it compared to most films nowadays. Still does not beat a good old Frank Capra screenplay though. - References: The other movies were not forgotten as much as I was thinking. The CGI Arnie was brilliant, such a great twist and addition for the fans; better than some horrible actor (cough, Sarah Connor Chronicles) - General Story: I admit, I did spent 7/8s of the film skeptically complaining about already figuring out the story and rararara, but I did not expect Markus to end up not being a full of Terminator who turns on everyone etc. - Camera-work: Absolutely enthralling; some great angles and shots in this. - Music: Everyone forgets how difficult it is (as a composer myself) to make a good score. Though Elfman did not write the score, he definitely shaped it for his liking and added in some of his own work towards the end for a brilliant soundtrack. - Scenery/mise-en-scene: It was great, I really felt immersed back into the old scenes in T1 and 2 which I have always wondered about. The debris and destruction was so elaborate and interesting, definitely made it for me. - Fighting/Combat: The fighting within the film was brilliantly choreographed and I really loved these scenes. Gave me the old feeling of watching the original movies. </li></ul><br/><br/>Bad points: - Acting: Though Bale is a highly regarded actor, there were so VERY weak scenes for him in this, but he did also pull some great scenes too. But the other characters, I'm sad to say, ruined it for me, and really did not like them too much; I found it all very ... Hollywood if you know what I mean. Not much different to T3, but it wasn't all bad. - Technology within the narrative: I know I commented on the brilliant mise-en-scene, but I really did not enjoy the futuristic technology used and computers; it really did not pay homage to T1 where Kyle talks about how they had nothing and were in the sewers with only dogs. But then again, that was some years after this and the resistance could have lost a lot of vechicles and supplies etc. - Bale's 'Hard'ness in the first half of the movie: I know the first half of a movie usually is like the introduction, but the introduction of Bale's character really did annoy me. He was portrayed as this untouchable person who could, you know, pick up a helicopter fly it on his own or just like jump into the sea and dive down to a submarine. Wtf? lol. But he really did shine later on in the movie.<br/><br/>Overall, I say it's a credible movie: 7.6/10.<br/><br/>For average movie-goers: Must-see For hardcore movie-goers: Might not enjoy it too much For Terminator fans: Try to see through to the relation with the other films.<br/><br/>Thank you."

","I went to see this movie after reading lots of negative reviews... to find out that this movie is close to the T2.<br/><br/>After all, this is just a sci-fi movie from a 1984 franchise... my expectation is to have fun watching it, and I did. Terminator Salvation is your above-the-average-action-movie to spend a night out... storyline could have been better OK, more action than substance OK, but we are talking about fighting killing robots and not to find the meaning of life.<br/><br/>A little note: thanks god the cinema did not play the volume too loud, so all the screaming and explosions were not so annoying but, actually, enjoyable.<br/><br/>A second little note: John Connor using the ""You could be mine"" hit from Guns N Roses from T2 movie to bait the terminator bike was pure class!!<br/><br/>Go watch it!"
"rogerdarlington","Null","2","3","10 June 2009"," Welcome return for a classic franchise
","""T1"" (1984) and ""T2"" (1991) were terrific, but then both were written and directed by James Cameron. ""T3"" (2003) - directed by Jonathan Mostow - was not in the same class, but still thoroughly entertaining. Even as ""T3"" was released, we knew that Arnold Schwarzenegger was embarked on a political career that was likely to mean that (in spite of his catch phrase) he would not be back in the iconic role.<br/><br/>Six years later, we are back - but with a different director and no Arnie and, in contrast with the largely contemporary settings of the first three movies, a story set in a post-apocalyptic 2018. At the helm on this occasion is McG (real name Joseph McGinty Nichol) - best-known for directing the two ""Charlie's Angels"" films - but some gravitas comes from the overly-intense Christian Bale as resistance leader John Connor and the Australian Sam Worthington as a cyborg with identity problems.<br/><br/>The narrative can be summarised in just six words: one explosion after another after another. In the middle of all these conflagrations, there are no less than ten types of machine seeking to eradicate the remaining humans. So there's plenty of exciting action and impressive visuals, but it's a classic case of a triumph of style over substance with minimal characterisation, a plot that is implausible when it is not confusing, and an ending that is surprisingly and disappointingly weak. Nevertheless there's certainly enough to enjoy here to encourage the plan that ""Salvation"" will be the first of a new ""Terminator"" trilogy."
"willy2004","Null","2","3","9 June 2009"," Way better than I expected...
","Before I begin, let me just say, Harry Knowles can go suck a fat one. Hollywood needs to stop giving that obese orangutan any perks, kickbacks and set visits because his disgusting review of Terminator Salvation was not only wrong, but completely atrocious. Who the hell talks like that? He not only gives fandom a bad name, he's also well past his used by date.<br/><br/>And after reading the ridiculous flaming and trolling by people on this board, I went into Terminator Salvation expecting something between Aliens Vs Predator 2: Requiem and a Uwe Boll movie. Fortunately, I was wrong. And quite frankly, I fail to understand why so many people on this board hate it so much. Actually, I suspect it's a select handful of people who are giving this film a bad wrap. It's also a built in disposition about McG - which I think has no base in reality, considering this was a very competent film. I think if anything, McG proved he can make a decent action film.<br/><br/>While far from perfect, what Terminator Salvation lacks in depth, it makes up for in heart. People complaining about lack of character development on John Connor seem to have missed the point. We don't need character development on Connor - because we already know him. We already know what and who he is. This film shows us the very early days in the war against Skynet. Connor is a resistance leader, but he's not the savior of humanity. At least not when the film begins. We've seen the great John Connor in previous films, but Connor does not just become humanity's Savior overnight. He needs to earn that right. He needs to earn that respect.<br/><br/>What I found refreshing was Marcus' arc. Basically, he arced more than Connor in this film. He found redemption - he saved Connors life, which I thought was a nice reversal at the end. Connor being saved by the very thing that tried to kill him for so many years. Now Connor has a heart which is only part human. It was a nice thematic touch.<br/><br/>In a lot of ways,this was Marcus' film. We see the events mainly from his perspective.We see this post apocalyptic world through his eyes. Aussie newcomer Sam Worthington definitely showed why James Cameron loves him so much. He has the depth and the brawn to be a top class movie star. He played the role of Marcus very well, and more often than not, out shined Bale.<br/><br/>The film looked absolutely gorgeous. Everything had the appearance of being dipped in ash. The robots were grimy, greasy and tattered. Connor and his troops were battle weary and ragged, stained with blood and sweat. And all the left-over weapons and military equipment were scorched and grimy. I loved the look of this film. It was very realistic.<br/><br/>There were some questionable parts which had me wondering what McG and the screenwriters were thinking – but for the most part, this payed nice homage to the original films, and the action was very well choreographed. The special effects, sound design and CGI were top-notch, as expected from ILM, and the Terminator Endoskeletons looked great. Especially the Arnhuld cameo. He looked rubbery because he was one of the first to come off the Skynet assembly line – and to my surprise they made Arnie look exactly like he did in the first film. I thought that was a great little touch.<br/><br/>One of the only real concerns I had with the film was Danny Elfman's score. At times it was brilliant. It suited the film – but the signature theme from Brad Fidel was only audible on 2-3 occasions. I would have loved it if they kept Fidel's original score. But never the less, McG did a solid job at adding to the franchise.<br/><br/>I'll be anxious to see where they go with Terminator 5. McG did hint at the London premiere last week that T5 may see John Connor travel back to present day to warn the military about Skynet and Judgement Day.<br/><br/>I for one can't wait. And I hope Bale and McG... Oh to hell with it, will be back."
"elliott78212","7","2","3","8 June 2009"," It's not All there but Worth Seeing
","I wanna start with the positives, Bale as usual is very intense and gives us the John Connor you would expect, MCG delivers in the special FX department along with a few bits of humor and a smidge of suspense, Anton Yelchin is an Actor people should be keeping an eye on he is a blossoming Talent. Now the bad little to no character development, a script that while it pays homage to the previous films has little else to offer many scenes that should have had exciting suspenseful build up just splash across the screen in Grand Big Budget Spectacle and that is the films weakness. All the films relied on good storytelling, sadly when I came home I rewatched the previous films, While the original Terminator was a low budget film Cameron incorporated suspense, character, and connected with the audience you cared about Kyle & Sarah. T2 expanded in both directions with solid character development, explosive visual FX, innovative approaches, and progressed the storyline moving it forward, with intensity, drama,even humor. T3 while weaker than the two movies before it still managed to deliver in style, suspense, yes Nick Stahl was a wimpy John Connor with that aside, Claire Danes was great and Arnold older now still managed to deliver, Christiana Loekane was awesome, with a weak script Jonathan Mostow still managed to delivery a satisfactory movie and this is my where things get weird can u believe I liked this one better than Salvation. I remember not really thinking that much of T3 but now it stands above the latest release. I sure hope Jane Alexander has more to do in the next installment what a waste of talent, and thats what I think of Terminator Salvation what a missed opportunity for true greatness."
"scttrs","7","2","3","8 June 2009"," Action packed movie, but it didn't really feel like a terminator film
","I've always been a Terminator fan with the original Terminator being one of my favourite films of all time, but the feeling with Salvation was detached from the previous instalments! Don't get we wrong, I scored it high and came away enjoying the film but a number of things let it down for me!.<br/><br/>Where were all the Terminators?...first films worked great with a ""just him and me"" feeling to them; but with Salvation having skynet self aware you would expect armies of theses metal mother****ers! Good example was the start of T3 with the glimpse of the future seeing an army of terminator sweeping through the land!...Salvation doesn't do this, something you would expect if machines had taken over the world wouldn't you think?...<br/><br/>Nuclear Holocaust? All major cities nuked by Skynet eradicating everything! So why all the lush plant life, tree and crystal clear waters?...I realise its a few years after the initial attack but Nuclear winter suppose to last 50 years or something right? <br/><br/>Previous films gave the impression people that grew up after Judgement Day have never seen a green and lush world. With an out-take in T1, Kyle Reese after spending the night in what looks like a sewer entrance is faced with the wood land he's never seen before getting a emotional!... but in Salvation certain parts look like 'New Forest'...<br/><br/>Taking down Skynet! - You would expect this place to be a epic fortress but was a joke!! You see one larger machine deactivated by Marcus, one walking about when Connor is by passing a door and a rubber faced 80's ripped Arnie; that was it!!...<br/><br/>Number of other things I like to mention, McG's attention to detail like Connors scar is a good touch!, Connors wife had a pointless roll and I thought Anton Yelchin played a convincing Kyle Reese!

Here we have countless terminators and a humongous skynet to fight against. It's quite logical to get the perception of emotionless characters if they're THAT hopeless.<br/><br/>McG did a great job directing, and the details are there to prove how dedicated he was to make action sequences the way they're meant to be made TODAY. (real speed on bombastic action, steady-cam on the big picture, first-person on the character centered sequences, detailed sound, etc.).<br/><br/>As to some people, the movie has many holes, filling them all will be insulting for fans and most smart people. The holes critics claim it has, is the way the characters deal with their reality, I mean, why has everything to be explained? It's not a 114 minutes long animated manual, it's a movie!. A movie that actually leaves many choices to be made on the sequels, a respectful movie, a movie meant to bee seen on the big screen.<br/><br/>Watch the movie before discussing it, it's worth it, at least for the eye candy it provides countless times."
"adhipar","7","2","3","7 June 2009"," Good Movie but not a Terminator sequel...
","I'm a big fan of Terminator and have watched all the T1 to T3 and also have them on my DVD collection. I think the essence of the Terminator series is how some inferior creature (and robot) being chased and hunted by a very superior indestructible killing machine(s) and survived. Along this plot, there are some mind-blowing action, explosion, sacrifice, drama, heroes, moral values, etc which push the audience stays in their seat till end of the film.<br/><br/>The T3 was weaker than the T1 and T2 but still follow this plot. However, the T4 has a new plot : it's an open war, not a chase/hunting scenes. A war in the future between two races. If we replace all the character's name in this film, then it's hard to link this film to previous 'T' series.<br/><br/>However, I didn't say it's a a bad movie. I think McG has tried his best, but the script is not powerful enough to fuel this film. Some scenes like John listening to his mom's tape or the ""I'll be back"" scene does not make me feel that this is a sequel.<br/><br/>So, I give 7/10 since it's a nice action movie. That's all. Sorry for my English."

","When walking into the cinema i was deeply worried. McG? the guy who directed Charlies Angels? They got someone like that to direct a Terminator movie? That was a very big risk. But luckily he pulled off a decent installment in one of the biggest movie franchise's of all time.<br/><br/>Terminator Salvation is missing some of the gems that made the other installments fun. Firstly no sense of humor. Secondly where's John Connor. He doesn't swear, he doesn't have attitude. Lastly, Hardly any violence. Which people would already know due to the American rating PG-13.<br/><br/>Luckily they got some things right. I loved the references to the old Terminator's. Made me feel at home. Also i loved the ending. Felt like classic Terminator style.<br/><br/>The biggest part of this movie is the war against the machines. What does that mean? Well it means action and lots of it. Explosions, car chases, guns, booms, bangs, kaboom. It never lets up in this movie but at the same time never goes over the top. The action scenes were great. Felt like a mix of classic Terminator and Transformers.<br/><br/>Before seeing this i felt like there would be no story just action scenes. The writers nicely put a story in that ties in with the first Terminator. Since the story ties in with previous Terminator movies you should see Terminator 1,2,3 just to be safe in the story area.<br/><br/>The Special Effects were amazing. Giant robots never looked so good. The acting was good and i liked the casting. From start to finish the movie is action with a great ending and a nice cameo. I felt relieved that the movie went out strong and was so happy to hear the old theme song again. Nice job Danny Elfman.<br/><br/>This was classic Terminator with a bit of new blood thrown in. It worked well and i would go see Terminator 5. There are some who will hate it but i just sat back and enjoyed the ride and so should you. I recommend it if your a Terminator fan. It was better then Terminator 3: Rise of the machines but it didn't match up to Terminator 2: Judgement Day. I give Terminator Salvation...<br/><br/>8/10"

You won't have Ahnold in it all that much(CGI cameo at end), you don't have Cameron directing it certainly, and you are always aware this is #4. But it works.<br/><br/>I liked Worthington though he is somewhat of a block of wood, still I rooted for the Marcus character and I liked what they did w/ him. The little deaf-mute black girl is just a prop and doesn't do much, but for whatever reason I wasn't bothered by her being there. I had to think hard to realize Bryce Howard Davies there was the Claire Danes character-they didn't give her all that much to do really.<br/><br/>Yelchin as Reese is very good, Bale mostly is one-note Johnny chewing the scenery, Ironside isn't on enough, you know. The F/X are quite good, the suspense of going into Skynet in SF and rescuing the prisoners tense and well handled, etc.<br/><br/>I'd say give it a 6.5 outta 10, **1/2 outta ****.

"Fallen_Carpathia-1","8","2","3","7 June 2009"," Not too shabby
","I really enjoyed this film, not nearly as bad as people made it out to be, I was almost worried that it was gonna be as bad as Terminator 3. But it was really quite fun, I'm not gonna say it was great cuz there were a few things that were, for want of a better word, crappy about it.<br/><br/>Here thar be spoilers!!! First bit that confused me, In the first Terminator Kyle Reese states that they can only go outside at night, it's safest there. however in Salvation it is stated that you can't go out in the night cuz HK's have infa-red vision...<br/><br/>Also, the very badly, and I mean BADLY superimposed CG face of Arnie on the T-800 that appears late in the film, OK the body double they used was great but the face... really was very bad, probably would not have been so bad if they hadn't used close up shots.<br/><br/>A small detail that bothered me was in the first two films it was made to look like the whole ground was littered with skulls and twisted ruins of terminators and vehicles, however here it was just a vast desert landscape without much really to look at.<br/><br/>Ultimately though the film was quite good, I enjoyed it, and I would most definitely watch it again, true it tends to stray a bit from what the first two laid down as the general ""rules"" of the film. As a stand alone film it is really quite good, but as a part of the Terminator franchise it is a bit lacking. The acting in it in general is not too bad while there is a considerable amount of pointless and unnecessary dialogue and quite a lot of predictable sequences."

I could not understand why Moon Bloodgood was in this movie. She was totally miscasted with her misplaced acting, beautiful woman though.<br/><br/>Micheal Ironside was a surprise for me. I like that man in SF movies, certainly in Total Recall. Unfortunately he had to leave the party this time also.<br/><br/>I would like to say that I'm looking forward to see a fifth terminator movie. Well, it will be the fourth movie, Terminator 3 is not worth to be mentioned compared to the other movies.<br/><br/>Story was great, Connor looking for his young father. Special effects were average, not many new stuff we haven't seen in movies before.<br/><br/>The voice of the woman speaking to John Connor on the tapes didn't sound like Linda Hamilton's voice. It is weird to see the movies go forward without Hamilton, Schwarzenegger Patrick and Furlong. They made Terminator to what it is now. The terminator movies (1 and 2) were not that bad compared to the batman movies of Burton. But McG made a worthy effort to continue the story of John Connor. I only hope he gives the audience more action in the fifth movie, I missed it in this movie."

","Decent enough and enjoyable.<br/><br/>Some brilliant new characters and surprisingly ones that the viewer actually gives a hoot about! On that point I think I found that the only character I didn't care about at all was John Connor and at the end of the film (which was incredibly rushed and just seemed to stop all of a sudden a la Halo 2!) I thought that there may be an ultimate incredible twist but alas McG just isn't that clever and probably didn't want the bother of thinking that deep for the next 2 instalments.<br/><br/>Enjoyed the cg elements and the introduction of the first set of terminators seemed well developed but I just wish that they didn't feel the need to include Arnie, just to stave off any elements of appearing to rely too much on the previous films and tick every single box.<br/><br/>Kyle Reese was very well done and congratulations to Anton Yelchin for nailing what I thought was a very credible performance and including of Michael Biehn's characteristics.<br/><br/>Could have been a lot worse but should have been better"
"coolmod","7","2","3","6 June 2009"," Definitely a salvation.....sorry had to say it
","terminator has seen its fair share of crap, actually the entire third film is an ungodly abomination but even then it has a certain appeal. Salvation pulls the franchise back from the brink with high pace action, some well rounded characters and some good special effects.<br/><br/>The plot does a good job of advancing the story here, sky-net are taking people from their homes and the resistance have found a way to fight the machines. And whilst these are good devices to move the story along neither one is fully explained, for instance, the reason people are being kidnapped is never fully explained and the ultimate weapon against the machines doesn't really find its feet and gets discarded half way through. There was so much more room for a war drama with the kidnapping being pivotal to the story and the action could have seen street and guerrilla warfare but ultimately the story is poor at best.<br/><br/>In counter respect though action scenes are well choreographed and with enough explosions gun play and machine warfare to keep the average view happy, but even then the subject matter begs to be more about conflict and fear and less about bang-bangs explosion but hey the inevitable sequel will probably build on this aspect.<br/><br/>Bale and Worthington show the talent they're known for as the male leads and Bryce Dallas Howard gives a good show for the girls which is one of the films high points, there is a real sense of drama and it never over steps its self into the terrible over acting found in Salvations predecessor.<br/><br/>Special effects are top shelf in most areas. There are some flimsy textures in areas but the machines are very believable and to be honest they bring back some of the fear lost in the third movie's femme fatale terminator.<br/><br/>Despite all the mean things that i said earlier i liked this film a lot sure the story and action weren't completely to my liking they did a good job of keeping me entertained as did the characters and the terminators themselves, but i cant escape the felling that this film could have been so much more than the sum of its parts, there was so much room here for a proper war film it had the cast to pull it off and the effects team to boot, but i suppose the agenda of the studio was to make as much money of this cash cow as possible so they opted for the explosions and action over substance and plot. All in all this is a good film, my only criticism, is that it should have been great."

","I saw the movie yesterday and i can say the movie was awesome. From the beginning to the end.The only mistake for me is that they could put some more story,more explanations and stuff.Everything was moving pretty fast and that's only thing i didn't like about this movie,but i can live with it.<br/><br/>Honestly i am a fan more to the second terminator than the first.Every time i see the end of T2 a tear falls.The direction,the story-telling,the action sequences--> everything was absolutely perfect.So,i was very excited hearing about this TS(after the disappointing,but not that awful T3). And then suddenly it's almost like a thunder ball hit me when i saw McG. Why the f**k McG?!!?! Who self-respected director would go by such a name..?!?!?! Charlie's Angels??!!? And now a $200 million dollars budget..??!?!?! Come on...<br/><br/>Then i read some of his interviews in which he states that he is working with John Nolan,Christian Bale,Paul Haggis,Anthony Zuiker and i was a little relieved.<br/><br/>Then i read that McG was a huge terminator fan and he wants to escape his awful reputation and i decided to give him the chance to impress me.And hell yeah .. he did.<br/><br/>I really can't understand all the bad press.Really. Yeah McG is not Cameron.Anton Yelchin is not Michael Biehn and so on and so on.<br/><br/>Now i thought the direction was very very impressive.I also prefer to see McG by the name Joseph Niccol,but in the end this is just a name.Don't hate him just because of it.He had his bad moments in TS,but most of the shots were absolutely perfect.Especially the one when i guy shouts""you brought it here"" and camera rounds around Kyle and Marcus and focuses on the Harvester.The opening scene,the ending scene,the fight between Marcus and the T-800 and many many more.Extraordinary. McG fully redeems himself with TS.<br/><br/>The only thing i didn't like about this movie is that it doesn't have the balance between the action sequences and the story-telling like The Dark Knight for example.It moves fast,really fast.Something i don't like to see in a movie,but after all this is McG's first attempt of a big movie,so i forgive him for everything he messed up.I think that he will do a lot better if given the chance to direct T5(i don't know what more they can't think of though).<br/><br/>TS brought us fun,pure fun.It showed us something that the great Cameron didn't want to do,because he thought it was a bad idea ""never do the same thing twice"".Well,McG took a big risk and i don't think he messed it up.He made a fine bridge between the next T-movies and the end of the war."

"Irie212","5","2","3","1 June 2009"," A strong story sacrificed to action sequences.
","Perhaps the most impressive thing about Terminator Salvation is the secret behind the title. The film is indeed about salvation-- but not the salvation of any familiar character like John Connor or Kyle Reese or even the T-800. Instead, this sequel tackles one of the richest themes of sci-fi: exploring the ""humanity"" of an artificial man. The secret of Terminator Salvation is that it begins, and crucially ends, with an original character-- a death row inmate called Marcus-- who becomes an entirely new hero in this long-established franchise.<br/><br/>If only the filmmakers had developed and respected that creative storyline. Instead, the idea is all but lost in a relentless, and relentlessly loud (not Danny Elfman's best work), maelstrom of action sequences. Adding to the ear injury is the screenplay. There are few if any memorable quotes, and many truly lame lines. Most memorable are the idiotic shouts of ""Hang on!"" when everybody was already (DUH!) gripping any available purchase to survive yet another deafening action sequence.<br/><br/>But although this movie disappoints, a lot of obvious talent went into it. I refer not to Christian Bale, who has become Hollywood's true Hoarse Whisperer. I refer to Sam Worthington, who brings a slowly building power to Marcus. It just seems that most of the all-important writing talent ended up on the cutting room floor. Many things do, of course, end up there in any film. But plot and character should not be among them. Sadly, in this case, they seem to have been the earliest victims of the unrelenting CGI."
"nhaynes84","7","2","3","27 May 2009"," Great Action Good Movie!
","T4 was a tenacious movie with tremendous action. Although, some of the action seems like it is just there for special effects-sake instead of adding to the overall juice of the movie. As a fan of the series, I thought T4 had certain strengths over its predecessors, mostly in effects, but sorely lacked the first 2 movies in character development. This movie was too sporadic and focused on action, and that took away the strong emotions that Arnold and Linda showed in the 2nd movie and that Beihn put forth in the first. Marcus Wright was too shallow and predictable. There were no twists with his character. Conner carried the movie with Bale's acting skill far surpassing the rest of the cast. I liked the little girl, as she showed what the young product of post-judgment day could be like. She was strong with no real evident emotion, exactly what you would come to expect from someone born into that environment. Reese was OK at best, and his character is really important to the future of the series and we really didn't get to know him. One big problem was inconsistencies carrying from the previous movies. Conner's character was very different with each different actor. Furlong was rebellious and care-free, but also a realistic product of Sarah Conner. Stahl was silly and a terrible bridge from Furlong to Bale. Bale was probably the closest to the grown Conner the first 2 movies indicated he would be. Finally, it was hard to warm up to a Terminator movie without Arnold. I knew of his appearance prior to seeing the movie, and I knew it was CGI, but I thought he had a much bigger role. His role would have added much more excitement to the movie. But it was cool to see anyway. Worth a trip to the movies but not an instant classic. Sets up a 5th installment well, and, if it materializes, that is going to be the one to watch."
"rsa5387","7","2","3","25 May 2009"," Terminator Lacks Soul
","Aside from some jaw-dropping visual effects and production design (sound, robots), T4 felt like it lacked any real significance, meandering from one action sequence to the next in-between lines of clichéd dialogue. Regardless, the acting was quite good, with Bale coming off as the only real disappointment. Usually an outstanding character actor, his character here really didn't have any development beyond being John Connor, leader of the resistance. As such, he was in 'Batman' mode throughout the the entire film, with dialogue mainly consisting of screaming, often incoherently. On the other hand, Sam Worthington was a real surprise, delivering an incredible performance as Marcus Wright. He saved the film, adding the only real touch of depth and emotion to an otherwise hollow, unengaging plot. Overall, while I can't fault McG's direction, if T4 had spent some more time in the scripting department, maybe we would have gotten something beyond a drearier version of The Matrix Reloaded. Disappointing."
"das417","7","2","3","23 May 2009"," Less than successful sequel that disappoints those who wanted more
","Terminator Salvation is very much a summer movie. Special effects, loud explosions, and over dramatic acting, ensure that Terminator Salvation is very much a movie that falls in line with other major summer releases. If you wanted a movie with good effects then this is the movie for you. If you wanted something more, well, then you will be disappointed. <br/><br/>John Conner (Christian Bale) is a member of the resistance. Humanity has been brought almost to extinction after the nuclear war launched by the computer Skynet and the later use of terminators and automated hunter killer aircraft. Along with his wife Kate Conner (Bryce Dallas Howard) the two struggle to not only stay alive but also to keep hope. John finds himself using old recordings his mother made during the 1980's and 1990's in order to keep his faith. Now that he is fighting the war he was always told to expect, he is finding himself tested in ways he never thought possible.<br/><br/>Marcus Wright (Sam Worthington) was a death row convict in the year 2003. Before his execution, Doctor Serena Kogan (Helena Bonham Carter) arranged an organ donation so that he could perhaps have a second chance. However, as he feels the needle going into his arm, Marcus awakens and finds himself in a nightmarish world where robots hunt humans and where Los Angeles is in ruin. He meets a teen by the name of Kyle Reese (Anton Yelchin) and a pilot named Blair Williams (Moon Bloodgood) who teach him how to survive this new world. Marcus then learns that he is not the human he once was and that he could be the greatest threat not only to Blair and Kyle but the human resistance as a whole. <br/><br/>The Terminator storyline is one that is well known so fans of the series can expect to see the future which the last three movies only hinted at. The world is desolate and death is everywhere. Director McG was able to give the impression of a world perhaps a little less evolved then that of Mad Max. We see how the resistance is controlled and how it deploys itself against Skynet not only in America but also around the world. Skynet itself is finally revealed in its true evil after Marcus, who we discover is a advanced cyborg which uses the organs he donated, confronts it. <br/><br/>The problem is that McG is unable to give the feeling of darkness and despair that the last three Terminator movies gave when it came to covering the future. Instead of massive ruins where skulls are crushed as if they were grains of sand, and large battles where small groups of humans find themselves overwhelmed by terminators, McG's future is one of hide and seek. The writing is good and the story flowed with no problems. The issue, however, is that it all feels superficial. This isn't helped by the use of explosions and special instead of dialog to keep the plot moving. McG's images of a San Francisco turned into a major Skynet facility and terminator production site is the best example of what the Terminator future should look like. It is a disappointing that he wasn't able to use more settings such as it to give a feeling as to what a world run by Skynet would appear.<br/><br/>Terminator Salvation is not a bad movie. The problem is that it felt rushed and the decision to use Marcus Wright as a cyborg locater feels hollow as does his sacrifice to save John Conner's life. There was the potential to go deeper into the human/robot question in terms of where does one begin and the other end by introducing the possible romance between Marcus and Blair. However, it is never really explored and thus it seemed almost unnecessary to have Marcus and Blair form the relationship they did.<br/><br/>The question is whether or not the next story will be able to surpass the disappointments within Terminator Salvation. There is reason to hope but the fans should demand something better.<br/><br/>7/10"

","The most recent update on the Terminator film series. Some might say it's not worth seeing, die-hard fans would give it high praise, there's no real big response to the film yet whether or not it will be a summer blockbuster.<br/><br/>Basically, it picks up where we left off from number three when Skynet began the attack on the humans. There is a bit of backtracking with the new and updated terminator machine and the history behind this model and how only one was manufactured much like Peter Weller's character in Robocop in the use of a human body.<br/><br/>The new machine sets out from Skynet to essentially eliminate John Connor and Kyle Reese. With more smarts than the rest, what's left of the human body tries to fight back against the orders and ends up playing out the role originally intended for Arnold if he was still acting. However it doesn't exclude his brief cameo he has toward the end of the film.<br/><br/>I'm not much one to list spoilers, however once you see the way this film ends, it makes me want to start right back at the beginning again.<br/><br/>The grading of the imagery should get high praise. It is very much earthly and worn on both the land and the machinery seen. It is very much in the same tone as Camp Crystal Lake in the recent remake of Friday The 13th. The acting is not that much different from the other three films which makes it realistic and firm."

","Terminator franchise started with two superb films that set a very high standard for any following sequel to match. I didn't care much about the third one. But when I finally gave this fourth installment a watch I thought it was ok. I mean, the third part was too similar to the earlier ones, trying to cash in with the face of Arnold but without much new to offer. Salvation on the contrary does something new. It feels like a justified sequel because it shows an important part of the mythos - the war-torn future which is referenced in the first films. The overall visual look is ok but not nearly as fascinating as the chilling opening scene of Terminator 2. Same goes with the script - it's ok but maybe a bit thin in terms of a good story. The movie turns a bit too much into a high speed action flick which feels too unrealistic. Don't get me wrong, there's a limit how realistic an action movie can be, but at times this movie feels a bit over the top. I would have liked it more if it was a bit slower, darker in tone, and more about suspense - sneaking and hiding away from terminators. I mean, even though we get a terrifying world full of deadly machines the movie still doesn't arouse much tension or excitement. We get to see a lot of different kind of robots which is cool. I just wish it was more scary. Still, it's an entertaining sci-fi action flick anyway and might be the third best Terminator film."

He is great when he is serious but (aside from the 1984 film, his character is goofy. I like the serious tone of these movies. The comedy should stay minimal. All Arnold is from T2 onward is comic relief. Salvation shows a world without him and it is great. Kyle reese is the comic relief and it's just enough to keep the pace. Christian Bale wasnt particularly outstanding in anything here really (a bit 1 dimensional if you ask me) but his supporting characters were great. Arnold's cg (and without dialogue) is all we needed from him. Tossing people like rag dolls. Bending steel. Not standing on one foot or terrifying bullying teenagers. I admit the bond between him and john in T2 was touching. But I could go for pages of the stupid and corny lines and directions they gave this man that were just too much.
The franchise would be better without him at this point. I was extremely disappointed in the follow up entitled Genisys. They should have continued Salvations storyline as promised."

","""Terminator Salvation"" (2009) is the fourth installment in the Terminator franchise. If you want to get as much out of it as possible, there are a few things you need to keep in mind before watching:<br/><br/>Terminator Salvation immediately raises the question: ""is this the worthy continuation to Terminator 2 that Terminator 3 surely as not?"" The answer is, sorry to say, a no.<br/><br/>Speaking in terms of quality, Terminator Salvation is quite strong. The effects are nice, the scenery is beautiful at times, and small inventive things can be found to further expand the Terminator universe. The consequences feel more real than earlier, the action is even thrilling, and you care more for the characters again. As a standalone film, Terminator Salvation isn't really that bad and can be enjoyable.<br/><br/>However, fans of the Terminator will immediately find issues, mostly in terms of plot consistency for the franchise. With this movie, we enter the iconic Skynet-controlled Los Angeles, a time we've only seen before in Kyle Reese's flashbacks from The Terminator, only to find that they don't match the present. There are indeed a few years between Terminator Salvation and said flashbacks, but the difference seems too big to compromise the two timelines. This isn't really a major detail, but for those who place weight on these details, it will be distracting.<br/><br/>As for the canon, Terminator Salvation doesn't contribute too much of additional information or insight. It can be skipped as a part of the franchise, but again, as a standalone film - and as a way to explore the Terminator concept - it is really not that bad.<br/><br/>My personal grade: a moderate 6/10.

All actors deliver excellent performances and seeing John and (pregnant) Kate adds yet another interesting layer to the cult of Connor. Sad they never got a chance to give this movie the sequel it deserved."
"Celluloid_Fiend","3","1","1","2 July 2019"," It Should Have Been ""Terminated"" On The Drawing Board!
","I had high hopes, like many, going into this film. As a fan of the franchise, I was looking forward to that ""blown out of my seat"" experience the other films of this saga have given me. Besides which, this is the film we've all been waiting for since the beginning, right? The future war! The resistance vs. Skynet! It couldn't possibly be bad, could it? Oh, you couldn't be more wrong!<br/><br/>This film lacked anything in the way of atmosphere or suspense. The mood of the film was extremely flat from almost the start and never really came to life. On top of that, I feel too much time was spent on the machines and not enough on John Connor and the humans (whom you'd think we should be rooting for). Sam Worthington's character, of the man made into a machine, never gained any sympathy or interest from me. The fact they gave away the ""secret"" to his character in the trailers, certainly didn't help that, either. His character's actions are schizophrenic, at best, half the time making little sense, if any, and almost never ring true. A major flaw, to be sure, with how much time he gets on screen.<br/><br/>Then you have Christian Bale, who plays John Connor as a ""Batman-lite"" affair. He uses the same kind of voice here, that he did in ""The Dark Knight"" and it just doesn't work. He portrays none of the charisma and leadership that we know the character is supposed to have. All the emotions we've felt for him in the past are all stripped away here, as he comes off like a whiny and self-absorbed jerk. Hardly one you'd want being the savior of the human race. None of the other resistance members get enough screen time to make any kind of impression on you, so you never develop any bond in what might happen to them. I don't know if the cast just didn't care about the film, or if the script just gave them nothing to work with, but there is no fire in any of the performances.<br/><br/>And even if the script doesn't let the actors down, it has more than a few problems itself. They never really explain why Sam Worthington's character is the one chosen by Skynet. The story never gives you any feelings of dread or panic, despite tons of action on the screen. And while those action sequences are well shot and choreographed, they lack any real excitement. It never gets your pulse pounding. Plus there are tons of little things in the film, like Connor's wife being pregnant, which get no explanation or even a passing mention. I mean, what's the point in doing that, if it doesn't mean anything? And why is Skynet herding people into camps (ala the Nazis)? Shouldn't it simply be destroying all human life, to protect itself and win the war? It is another plot point that makes no sense, nor is given any reasoning for, in a script filled with them.<br/><br/>Worst of all, and the one major flaw that ruins the whole film for me, is how, after Skynet has captured Kyle Reese (played by Anton Yelchin, in one of the few decent performances in the film), it doesn't kill him immediately, but uses him as bait to lure John Connor into a rescue mission. This kind of thinking, in terms of revenge and greed, is an emotional human failing Skynet should not have. It is a machine. It should know the simple equation: ""Kill Kyle Reese, John Connor is no more!"" The only reason for it, is to provide the big end battle, where Connor faces the Terminator 101-model (with CGI used to show Arnold in his prime). It's all just a waste and doesn't deliver any thrills.<br/><br/>Many folks blasted ""T3"" for some of the inconsistencies it had, but compared to this mess of a film, it was sheer cinematic brilliance! ""Terminator Salvation"" could truly be considered a franchise killer, on par with the fiasco that ""Batman and Robin"" was for the Batman one. Old school fans of this saga will not find this enjoyable, and any attempts to bring in new fans will be dashed at the overly-complicated back-story used to get them up to speed on this film. In short, this is a film that will appeal to few people, be they fans of these films or not. It is a complete waste of time, money and talent. And that is the purest definition of the term ""whipped up movie,"" which this effort most assuredly is, that I can think of!"

","When it comes to science fiction, one can find many technical plot holes, especially if time travel is involved. Because the very definition of time travel introduces a paradox, due to something called Butterfly Effect. Because of that, the single act of going back in time may alter the chain of events that would easily lead to the travelers deletion from existence, provided they go far back enough before their conception. I'll give an example of my take and understanding of this effect, If we had the chance to observe this in real life, we could have seen an entire silhouette of a city change dramatically, just as a result of going back in time fifty years or so and stopping someone in the street and asking them where the nearest post office is and coming back. As Sarah Connor put in the first Terminator film ''...a person can go crazy thinking about all this...'' That's why I don't nitpick Sci-Fi movies on those issues, as long as it's a well made movie otherwise. Because of those reasons, I didn't nitpick this one on technical plot holes as well. I just wanted to make it clear that that's not my problem with the film. My first problem with the film is its existence in the first place. I am not always against remakes and sequels, but there are some films that need to be left alone. Terminator films(the original 2) didn't need any sequels, but we keep getting them. And even James Cameron himself is still trying to cash in on it and he is ruining his own legacy. Kudos to Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale, who own the right to Back to the Future franchise and they refuse to authorize any reboot or remake during either one's lifetime. It's called artistic integrity. I cringed every time they made a reference to the originals, like ''come with me if you want to live'' or ''I'll be back''. My second big problem with the film was the characters' behavior. Blair just meets a random dude and she immediately decides that he's a good person, and I'm not talking about the first impressions that people feel when they first meet, she literally tells him that he is a good person as if she has known him for years. Ridiculous dialogue always makes me angry and wonder if the movie has been made by aliens or an A.I, which would be ironic.<br/><br/>If you can ignore those, it's a well made film, technically speaking. Visual effects and action are pretty cool, actors are charming. You will probably not remember a thing about it a year after, but it'll entertain you while you are watching it."

With the attack on Skynet imminent Connor determines that he must save Kyle before the attack.<br/><br/>This film is very different to the previous instalments; apart from the prologue it takes place after Judgement Day and John Connor is a leading resistance fighter not merely a target of time travelling Terminators. This post-apocalyptic setting made it feel very different. The action was impressive and almost non-stop; unfortunately this was at the cost of character depth. The story itself is interesting enough and I liked the twist concerning Marcus, probably the film's most interesting character. Sam Worthington does a solid job in the role and Christian Bale was equally solid as Connor. The rest of the cast were pretty good although I was a bit disappointed that Michael Ironside was somewhat underused as the leader of the resistance. The CGI used to make a T-800 look like a 1980's Arnie was rather fun. Overall I'd say this is a decent enough sci-fi action film but I preferred the first three."

","It gives you the fight you expect to see i.e. humans versus machines and throws in a decent premise too. I also like Christian Bale and Sam Worthington which helps it all go down nice and smooth. In this movie, the machines go all out on using their intelligence to serve themselves and survive but you know how unpredictable humans can be. The machine find this out the hard way and the story continues. It is interesting to note that there is a sort of stalemate in general between us and the machines which helps to make the time travel plan of attack make sense. Get them before they are born rather than go mano de mano is the machines thinking. Of course humans realize this and we get the series as their ongoing response to this. I was captured to the plot, followed it and it led to a decent conclusion one comes to expect from this series. Recommend a tasty drink and snack while watching and certainly the popcorn is a nice use of hands and fingers instead of biting them and fidgeting around. Tune in and you won't be terminated just entertained"

","Even worse than Terminator 3 Rise of the Machines. Terminator Salvation is a stupid science fiction action movie. The first 2 movies were clever science fiction movies. Explosions go off and the directors want you to be excited, but your not because it's just Bruce Wayne meets the guy from Avatar and sh*t hits the fan. There are some scenes which will please old school Terminator fans and people just looking for mindless action. But there all about 30 minutes apart and are too infrequent to redeem the rest of the film. Terminator Salvation is a stupid science fiction movie with NO MEMORABLE LINES WHATSOEVER which is the exact opposite to the first two movies and overall it reminded me of Transformers Revenge of the Fallen drunk."

","Im not going to repeat over and over again whats been said about this film compared to the T1 & 2.<br/><br/>There was one thing that annoyed me. Okay in the first two films you see shots of the future war, you see the world torn apart by nuclear war. You see a dark sky and humans fighting on a post apocalyptic battle ground. Since its the future they are using laser guns, not machine guns. It creates a real scary atmosphere and you also feel nervous for these humans fighting in that atmosphere...and I applaud James Cameron for that.<br/><br/>Even though I have seen the first two films about 20 times each when I am watching the terminators chase Sarah/John Connor I still feel on the edge of my seat and the intensity kills me! Cameron creates sort of like a ""terminator atmosphere"" So Terminator salvation is set in that future and I feel nothing like that, there's no ""terminator"" atmosphere to it and you hardly even see and t-800's in the film. If you are going to create a film based on previous master pieces I feel you have to copy exactly what they didn't that concept of the film and Salvation done the complete opposite.<br/><br/>Big Transormer type terminators chasing humans on a desert with machine guns, sorry just doesn't feel anything like Terminator. It really was a pathetic attempt.<br/><br/>Just another average action film."

","better than terminator 3: rise of the machines. not near as good as terminator 2.<br/><br/>the whole thing looked a little too much like the matrix after they got neo into the ""real world."" all post apocalyptic and all. which is what the world is after judgment day i suppose. but still.<br/><br/>i did really enjoy all the ""shout outs"" to this films predecessors. i'll not spoil the cool parts for ya but be on the look out for ""i'll be back."" in one scene john Connor, played very seriously by Christian bale, is baiting a terminator with a boom box blasting out ""you could be mine"" by guns and roses. that's from terminator 2 for you newbies out there. and the coolest shout out of all i thought is also the most obscure. only die hards i think will catch it. in the original terminator the character of kyle Reece, john Connor's father who was sent by john Connor from the future to protect his mother, is played by Michael Biehn. this time around the teen age kyle Reece is played by Anton yelchin. who by the way plays Chekhov in the new star trek film. (that kid has had a busy summer already) the first words spoken by both actors in each of their respective films is the same exact words. and it's really cool if you catch it.<br/><br/>other than that, this film kinda left me feeling a little flat. the actors are all very good. Sam Worthington does a great job as the secondary male lead. moon bloodgood makes me want to work out harder at the gym. Bryce Dallas Howard is good at john Connor's love interest. she's pregnant with his baby in the film and it looks like she actually is pregnant. her hands look swollen. so that's either a spectacular make up job or she got pregnant before the film started shooting and they just went with it. either way, that is a beautiful woman. way to go little opie Cunningham.<br/><br/>maybe i'm just spoiled by star trek being so good and this film will be better on DVD. but for now i'm giving it two severed T-800 heads out of a possible five.<br/><br/>there is one big surprise treat near the end of the film that i won't give away but you may find yourself pumping your fist in the air and shouting ""yes."" i did anyway."
"mattwaterhouse","4","9","25","11 June 2009"," Ridiculous
","I'm going to be honest here. I had no idea what to expect with this movie. Its a completely different film to the previous trilogy, so what made those movies good might not work as well here in what is essentially a war movie. I went into the theatre blind, which I suppose gave me an element of impartiality.<br/><br/>So I sat there in the theatre and I thought, this movie, at the very least, has to be better than T3. At the very least. Although T3 is decent, the problems that faced it were easily solve-able, so this film should be able to give us a decent story etc. Two hours later, I had my answer.<br/><br/>It couldn't even manage that. Terminator Salvation was ridiculous.<br/><br/>The plot is as follows. It is 2003. Marcus Wright is on death row, and is convinced by a dying doctor to sign his body to medical science. Flash forward to 2018, and after a failed attack on a Skynet base by John Connor, Marcus awakens in the post apocalyptic mire and meets Kyle Reese, who is later captured by the machines. John Connor, discovering this, has to launch a rescue mission before the resistance leaders nuke the place where he is being held. But is Marcus all that he appears? If you've seen the trailer for the movie, you already know that answer.<br/><br/>This is a perfect example of how advertising can shoot your film in the foot. The biggest and most interesting twist in this movie is given away in the trailer. What this serves to do is remove a lot of the tension in the Marcus Wright scenes. This is especially annoying when you consider that Marcus is the most interesting character in the film. Sam Worthington isn't the best actor in the world, but he does a good job here, aside from having virtually no reaction to waking up in what is essentially the Capital Wasteland from Fallout 3. His scenes are really the best thing about this movie, especially when he meets up with Reese, played by Anton Yelchin. Again, Yelchin does a good job here, his character doesn't have a huge amount of depth but the character is fairly interesting, with subtle echoes of Michael Biehn's portrayal way back in T1. And they are the only two characters that are worth anything.<br/><br/>John Connor is an established character in the franchise, played brilliantly by Edward Furlong in T2 and pretty well by Nick Stahl in T3. At the beginning of this movie they introduce John Connor via text as this sort of warrior-prophet who has managed to predict the future correctly thus far, and some people believe him and some don't. This is actually an interesting angle to take on the character, which is never brought up in the whole movie. I'm not kidding here, at no point in this movie is John Connor anything but a guy with a gun, when he could have been and should have been so much more. Worse still, he's pretty much vacuous, there is no trace of the resourceful kid or the guy who had to listen as the world ended around him. All this Connor is is a guy who thinks all problems can be solved by shouting a said problem. Connor is played by Christian Bale, who is in one gear throughout the whole movie: intense. Has was so intense they could have brought in Keanu Reeves to play the character, and the sad thing is he probably would have done a better job than Bale. And whoever said to him, ""no its fine, do it in your Batman voice if you want,"" should go and sit in the corner, and think about what they've done.<br/><br/>The rest of the characters are just a motley crew of blank and vacuous plot devices. From Common to the mute kid. They all suck.<br/><br/>Oh and thanks to all you prissy internet idiots out there who complained about the ending to this movie, McG and co. changed the entire third act. To be fair, it isn't that bad. But the actual ending to the movie is just stupid. What they had planned was MUCH better.<br/><br/>Now for the more positive stuff. The special effects are cool. The robots are cool, and actually pretty scary in some instances, which captures some of the essence of the first Terminator. As much as I've faulted the acting and the characters, McG isn't a bad director. Some of the action sequences and most of the fights are very well done and are well paced. This goes for the whole experience, the pace only really falters once or twice. This movie isn't badly directed at all. It's badly, laughably written. The script is peppered with bad dialogue and references to the older movies that are crow-barred in. It took me out of the movie every time instead of flowing along naturally with the rest of the dialogue, like it does in films like the new Star Trek.<br/><br/>Overall, this is the weakest film in the franchise by far. The gulf between all the other movies and this movie is pretty sizable. I hope this is the end of the franchise, but considering that they have set up for a possible sequel, I doubt its over just yet."

OK, T2 had more polish and OK acting, but overall, the Terminator series has been plagued with terrible acting at best, with the exception of Joe Morton's powerful death scene.

Can anyone explain why he has been cast in all these action leads? Christian Bale is a little bit gaunt and unattractive - would have been good to have someone a little better looking for a hero.

(Please don't tell me otherwise and/or get me started on Michael Bay!) <br/><br/>2.Not a particularly clever plot. No twists. Awful clichéd feel which seemed to remind me of lots of other films. A bit of Matrix. A taste of MadMax. Even Contact (ooh which form shall we use to talk to you) Surely a Terminator film sets its own agenda as with certainly the first 2 and probably even the 3rd.<br/><br/>3.Below par acting. Love Michael Ironside in the Top Gun and Starship Troopers but boy is he a one trick pony. You may say he didn't have a large part but it was symptomatic of the casting as a whole. Lazy. Mr Bale showed more passion when he flipped out in rehearsals. I get that he has the fate of the world hanging on his shoulders but you know - chill (?). No-one else stood out for me.<br/><br/>Overall feel for me was of a bad 80's sci-fi action flick but with slightly better effects. I was even open-minded about Charlies Angels boy directing before I'd seen it even though everybody else had written him off. Nothing personal against the guy but I hope he doesn't get to direct a big-budget actioner ever again. <br/><br/>I can't find one redeeming feature.

And overall the terminators are just so inadequate at ""terminating"" at the end of the film Kyle and John are able to out manoeuvrer them as if they are in a zombie movie. <br/><br/>Bale has stated that he took the Connor role as he sees more films coming, you have to wonder what they can keep doing with bale and this current time line as stories?"

The backdrops and general atmosphere are frightening<br/><br/>But (and I'm sure many will agree), there are so many ridiculous scenarios played out and inconsistencies that it renders the movie completely lame. For example:<br/><br/>1. Everyone (i.e. the audience) knew that the main guy was a machine, so the fact that it took over an hour to declare that and then make out like it was a surprise when it was unearthed was annoying.<br/><br/>2. Why not kill all humans on sight instead of herd them (although maybe they were harvesting organs, but the T800 didn't need a brain, heart, etc ...)? Also, why not kill the main people when they had the chance? They already had Rees ... the infiltrator could have killed Connor.<br/><br/>3. The resistance kept going on about how the machines had infra-red and therefore had the advantage in the dark. Evidently, they deactivated this ability to even things up?!<br/><br/>4. Old terminators had built-in mini-guns and destroyed everything in their sight. The 'new and improved' Arnie terminator (the T800) evidently could only throw things!!!!! One punch or squeeze could have killed Connor, but instead it opted to keep throwing him around everywhere and it had no weapons. LOL.<br/><br/>5. Star ... WTF?!<br/><br/>6.

This movie almost has 80% by rotten tomatoes community but is given a mere 34% by top critics.<br/><br/>As a die hard Terminator fan, this movie is incredibly better than T3 and definitely holds it own again T2. Roger Eberts purely stupid critic that the movie lacks a plot has not even seen T1. This movie hold true to the series and give the audience what they paid for and then some. He claims it is 90% action when in reality there are so many subtle aspects of this film that a Terminator fan, would NOT get. It's a damn shame when a critic writes something about a film he doesn't even understand.<br/><br/>This film has character development and great affects, and most of all fantastic casting. Christian Bale IS John Connor. He portrays the strength and integrity that Kyle Reese rants about in T1 ""I'd die for John Connor"".<br/><br/>Anton Yelchin's version of Kyle Reese is perfection. He portrays the youth and yet the intensity of the character brilliantly.<br/><br/>There are so many things about this film that make it great.

This film is it's own story in it's own way. But at the same time, it is like the Classic Terminator. There are a few scenes, like the opening for example, or the ending, as well as a few car chases in the middle of the film that make you as a viewer feel like you are watching The Terminator.

"mexicospidergreen","4","4","9","22 May 2009"," If this is Salvation, then Terminator Terminated will be next
","Christian Bale has saved Gotham City from criminal masterminds, but can he save the human race from total destruction? In Terminator Salvation he plays John Connor, the leader of the resistance and the only hope left for mankind. After Skynet has won the battle between man and machine, it's up to him to lead a group of survivors including a stranger (human/robot) who believes he has the key to saving our planet. Who will win the ultimate battle between man and machine? The fight is on. Before I go onto anything about this movie, let me say I was looking forward to seeing this, until I saw 3 things about this that made me change my mind. First off was the PG-13 rating. Once again, we have another movie that's first in the franchise not given an R rating (Live Free or Die Hard anyone?) Second off was that it was cut 20 minutes, which made me think ""Oh my god this is lame."" And third off, Arnie himself wasn't in it as the T-800. I know he has a state to run but can't he at least come back as T-800 and say a line or two? Now back to the movie. Despite its PG-13 rating and cut minutes I knew I was eventually going to see this (because it's Friggen Terminator dude) and I hate to say it but it was a huge letdown. It was a letdown for many reasons but mostly it's because it feels like a TV movie with all the wooden acting. The other big disappointment was the final battle against the T-800. Maybe in the previous 3 it was machine vs. machine battles and here it's human vs. machine. I know that Arnie's appearance was only in it for 60 seconds or so but even if they actually got him to star in it his role isn't very big at all. Anton Yelchin although far less annoying in here than in Star Trek still didn't do such a convincing job as Kyle Reece (John's father.) Like the guy's almost 10 years younger than John Connor, so how could he be his father? Can someone please explain that to me because, I'm still on a WTF basis about that. Terminator Salvation isn't horrible (some decent special effects, and breathless action sequences made up for some of it) but it's just very disappointing on so many levels. It didn't even have the T2 song at the end like ""What the Heck?"" Bottom-line if you're a Terminator newbie you'll probably enjoy if but for us fans look elsewhere because the freshness and inventiveness from the previous ones is all gone. Save your money, your time and yourselves."
"rn189307","6","4","9","22 May 2009"," The Story Lacks Slightly but Definitely Worth Seeing
","I just went to see Salvation last night and I must say I definitely enjoyed it. There is no question that this movie legitimately warrants the $5-10 bucks people will shell out to see this on the big screen (it is certainly worth seeing it on the big screen if nothing else). OK, so the story lacks a little bit, actually it lacks a lot. There isn't really a whole lot of substance to this film but the potential is there. <br/><br/>It's nearly impossible to avoid the frequent belittlement of Director McG regarding this movie and I think it needs to be addressed. Yeah, maybe he isn't the next Steven Spielberg but nonetheless he's giving it his all. For the haters who claim McG is the reason this movie is ""trash"", they need to point the finger elsewhere. Though the dialogue in this movie probably only constitutes about 10 pages of the script and can be summed up in any one of the theatrical trailers, the blame should not fall on McG but rather the screenwriters John Brancato and Michael Ferris. McG didn't write the script for this, he was in charge of making this movie pretty, and believe me this movie is pretty.<br/><br/>The visual effects in this film are second to none. I was simply blown away at the intensity conveyed in some of the action sequences and the cinematography is stellar. Props to the production design and art direction of this movie for creating such a believable and realistic post-nuclear world that is so bleak, barren. The various models of Terminators in Salvation are bigger, meaner and more bad-ass than ever before and the explosions only get bigger as the movie rolls on. There is no doubt this movie is a summer-action-get your popcorn ready-blockbuster movie, and it should be treated as so. <br/><br/>Though Bale seems almost typecast from his role as Batman, he is still the perfect fit as John Connor. Let's just hope Public Enemies (later this summer) and his next Terminator performance encompass more emotion so that we don't see Bale succumb to the regretfully same generic action hero that Nicholas cage has become.<br/><br/>Even though the story lacks slightly in this movie, we have to collect ourselves and take a step back to realize that development for another movie is already underway. Lets be positive and think of this movie as a segue, merely a transition to familiarize the audience with the barren, post-apocalyptic landscape, and the key players of the resistance for the ensuing, and more complete story yet to come in the next film. Keep your fingers crossed.<br/><br/>All in all, this movie is worth seeing simply for the unbelievable visual-effects, just try not to be too nitpicky."

","First of all I must say that everyone who has written a negative review about this movie are completely off base! They are apparently seeking something from the movies that they will never ever receive. This was an amazing film and...I know everyone is entitled to their own opinion but...if they want to be wrong that's fine, I just wish they would keep it to themselves! <br/><br/>This movie had it all! Action, suspense, explosions, chase sequences...everything that has made the last three Terminator movies so good. Sure, Arnold wasn't in it as a major role this time but this works out okay because this movie is supposed to take place in a time when his model terminator is in the beginning stages of construction.<br/><br/>SPOILERS AHEAD: And actually you do get to see ""him"" (in a way) towards the end when a skin covered T-800 prototype attacks John. The actor they got to play it looks VERY close (I'm talking identical twin here) to Arnold. All they had to do was a bit of CG to this actor's face and poof, you had Arnold in T4! It was great seeing it too. It (the T-800) looked almost exactly like it did in the 1984 movie when it first stood up after coming through time. I totally thought it was Arnold's face computer added to the actors body, that's how well they did. The T-800 prototypes without skin also stayed true to their design from the original film which I found very impressive.<br/><br/>There were little treats all throughout the film as well that paid homage to the first three films. They had Sarah's voice in the tapes she made for John (and we see the picture Reese carries with him later on), Kyle saying the ""come with me if you want to live"" line, John taking over the ""I'll be back"" line, and (my friend is the one who caught this) the music that John plays from the boom box as he reconfigures the motorcycle terminator is the same Guns n Roses song that was playing in T2 when we first met the young John Connor.<br/><br/>There were new things too. Bale was by far the best John Connor because, let's face it, Bale is good in pretty much anything he's in. I give lots of props to Anton Yelchin as you could tell he had studied Michael Biehn's acting from T1. He had his vocal and facial inflections down pat.<br/><br/>I only reserve level 10 rankings for movies that really deserve them. I haven't rated a movie this high since Star Wars Episode 3. What determines whether I give a 10 rating depends on how I feel as the credits are rolling. Was I just blown away? Was I rendered speechless? Were my expectations exceeded? If I can answer yes to these questions (As I was able to for SW3 and now for Terminator Salvation) then the movie gets a 10. Don't listen to all these haters...if you are a fan of the Terminator franchise you will love this movie! I will certainly be waiting eagerly for the next two installments!"

It is also an improvement in terms of directing choice since his vision of Charlie's Angels is pathetic at best. Thankfully he chose not to repeat that mess with The Terminator series. Christian Bale plays John Connor who leads the war against the machine army. This character is greatly linked to the original. Sam Worthington plays Marcus Wright, half human half machine. He doesn't realize this yet but when he does he will prove that his human side is dominant towards good and will make the ultimate sacrifice. Anton Yelchin plays Kyle Reese whose future regards the original film. Moon Bloodgood plays a fighter pilot saved by Wright. She in turn will defend his honour when his motives are questioned. Bryce Dallas Howard plays John's wife Kate in casting that proves innovative. While it is just entertainment, it brings the franchise much needed life and background information. It brought salvation to a franchise that was nearly destroyed by its previous sequel. Score: 9 / 10"

","As you probably have guessed from the title, I didn't like this film. Thinking about it, it may have been okay as a stand alone film but putting it into the Terminator franchise is just shameful.<br/><br/>There are a lot of mixed reviews on here about this film but I, for one am severely disappointed. So here's some of the storyline: teenage Reese gets captured. John Connor has to save him. And here's the rest of the storyline: oh wait..thats it! Sticking in some extra characters made the film a bit more interesting but pretty much they were only there to pad out the plot.<br/><br/>Addmittedly, some of the special effects were good but I think the film focused too much on them and especially chase scenes rather than developing the characters. I'm on the fence with the acting in this film. Whilst some of the actors were really good and actually made you feel some emotion towards them, others were pretty damn bad. I don't know if it was down to the director or the actor but I think Christian Bale should stick to his Batman films, which he actually acts well in. He didn't exactly act as if he cared about anyone. Maybe it sounds like i'm over exaggerating a bit but its true. Horror films usually use characters as a way to travel through the story. The Terminator franchise comprise of characters we're meant to care about.<br/><br/>And how predictable was this film really? It was pretty obvious what the ending had to be otherwise it wouldn't fit in with the first three films. Also, it was pretty predictable with what had happened to Sam Worthington's character at the beginning of the movie, although for a main character in this film, we didn't get to know much about him. I guess though, that may have been because there were too many characters in this film that it focused on.<br/><br/>Yes I realise this is probably a very long winded review but I needed to rant about this poor excuse of a film. I recommend people who are huge fans of the original 3 not to watch this utter rubbish as it's hardly relevant in terms of the story, probably just an excuse for the company involved to make more money on it. If you take this film as a stand alone movie however then maybe you WILL enjoy it."
"TanQ","1","3","6","12 December 2011"," Fanally, a movie to make me feel better about T3!
","Okay, let me preface this by saying 3 things. 1) I'm not a rabid fanboy that thinks this series is epic in any way. 2) I'm not a hater of science fiction, even bad science fiction. 3) I don't think that you can add a spoiler to something that's already spoilt. <br/><br/>That being said, there won't be any spoilers here just because I don't care enough about this movie to really go in any sort of depth. So why am I writing this? Maybe it's to gently remind people that this is a movie about killer-robots from the future. It's not art, folks. It's not the epic statement of humanity in our time. <br/><br/>Where this movie fails, is that it's completely forgotten it's roots. The first 3 movies in the series didn't take themselves too seriously. At least the first and third didn't. The second one was practically pompous by comparison. Still, Terminator 2 was still somewhat aware that it was a science fiction film wrapped around a chase scene. That's where the excitement and fun came from. There was also a lighter side. The suspense was tempered by a self deprecating sense of humour. That's where Terminator Salvation fails.<br/><br/>Terminator Salvation is a movie that forgets it's roots. All of them. The chase sequences are tired, there is no humour, there is no self awareness. Instead we're given bleak. It's almost as if director McG sought out new sources of bleak to throw in as a substitution for depth. There's nothing to frighten, or challenge or even lightly amuse the audience here, only dirt, sludge, grime and stern looks. <br/><br/>Christian Bale truly shows his range as an actor. He has none. He glowers, glares, and gives us vacant grimaces as he tries his best to look like a killbot from the future. I'm guessing no one told him he wasn't playing the terminator. It's a tragic thing when you're out acted by a killbot.<br/><br/>The special effects aren't anything we haven't seen before. The plot is really little more than a chase across some landscape which, I may point out, was done better in the previous 3 movies of this franchise. The characters don't really need names, you won't remember them anyway. The direction and writing go from lazy to comatose and it's really difficult to say anything positive about this straight-to-video theatre release. <br/><br/>If this is the salvation of mankind then bring on Judgement Day."
"XweAponX","10","3","6","13 June 2011"," Sam Worthington makes a whole new kind of Terminator
","Despite the Franchise changing John Connors as often as a T-1000 can change identity, The Terminator Story is now moved up into the time frame when Connor is in the resistance. <br/><br/>These ""Alternate Timeline"" stories are as popular now as when the first Outer Limits was on Television with stories like these, during the Golden Age of Science Fiction when Harlan Ellison was writing ""Demon with a Glass Hand"" (On which the original Terminator movie was based). And so the Familiar elements of the Timeline... John Connor, Kyle Reese, Kate Brewster, and even the T-800/850/101, intermingle with the topnotch storytelling of X-Files Bard John Brancato, who also wrote T3.<br/><br/>Christian Bale plays John Connor who is taking charge of the future he was groomed to live in - He is gathering his ""Tech-Comm"" unit and although in this film, he is not yet Leader of the Resistance, Bale portrays him as a No-Nonsense leader... Gone is the Kid of T2: Judgment Day played by Edward Furlong, and no more of the wandering, hiding John Connor of T3 played by Nick Stahl, although Stahl had taken the role and made it his own, the change to Christian Bale was not a mistake.<br/><br/>The Kate Brewster mantle was dropped onto Ron Howard offspring Bryce Howard, whose blind girl in M. Night Shyamalan's ""The Village"" put her on the very visible map, and she no slouch in the Brewster role either, other portrayals include Anton Yelchin as a teenage Kyle Reese, Yelchin had captured all of the mannerisms of the character made by Michael Biehn.<br/><br/>And so we come to the new, Arnold-Schwarzenegger-Replacing central character, Marcus Wright - played by new Action star Sam Worthington, who I have said is the Orlando Bloom of the 2010's.<br/><br/>The Hapless Marcus Wright, eagerly awaiting execution sells his Body to the dying Dr. Serena Kogan (Helena Bonham Carter)- Only to wake up in the middle of a small Nuclear Explosion. We see Wright for a second, in the underground Skynet facility Connor breaks into, and discovers that the T-800 Program is underway much earlier than expected.<br/><br/>This can probably be attributed to Wright's appearance in the Timeline, Technologies that Skynet did not originally have, were on hand due to Dr. Kogan's experiments.<br/><br/>The way Brancato melds it all into the original Terminator story, we know that the things seen in this treatment of the storyline will come to pass, just not in the way expected. The Wright character shines a whole new light on these events, and so, most of Terminator Salvation is seen through the jaded eyes of Marcus Wright.<br/><br/>After Wright connects with Reese and the mute Star (JadaGrace Berry), his adventures begin, and Wright cannot guess where: Losing Reese and Star, Wright connects with love interest A-10 Pilot ""Williams"" who has to eject on top of Wright's head. Moon Bloodgood plays Blair Williams, and immediately pursues Wright. What else is there to do in an apocalyptic future but repopulate? She becomes unrequited in that pursuit. Blair brings him straight to Connor and a startling revelation that he is not what he thinks he is... And that is all the spoiler I can put in here; this is basically the story of Wright, and his interactions with the characters we met in the 1st 3 films and in this one.<br/><br/>There are MANY homage's to the earlier films; just about every scene in this film has a reference to an earlier Terminator. For instance, when the MotoTerminator jumps over the truck (Like Arnold/T800 did in T2) during a chase scene, Wright knocks out the broken glass in the window of the truck he is driving, just like T-1000 in T2. We can hear all of the ""I'll Be Backs"" and other famous Terminator Phrases cleverly added to the dialogue. I like that they did these homage's, some of them are subtle, others blatant.<br/><br/>The Kicker of this film, of course, is the Guest-Appearance of Arnold's face on the very first T-800 ever made - Which was photorealistic to the point where it did not look exactly like Arnold looked, it was meaner. This first T800 is several notches more powerful than Arnold's original T800 - He is MUCH harder to kill.... RPG's which would have turned the first T800 into scrap only succeeds in destroying the T800's Flesh. The combat chassis underneath the Arnold Visage is not the same Silver Titanium Hyperalloy Combat Chassis (Microprocessor Controlled) - This metal is More Durable.<br/><br/>I honestly admit when I watched this, I didn't like a couple of things, but as you get into the 3rd, 5th, and 10th viewing of this film it grows on you, the Marcus character grows on you, and Worthington played this part VERY well. So far I've liked all three major films Worthington has been in. He makes this film for me, although the other actors in this ensemble cast are also good. Michael Ironside makes his usual small role appearance.<br/><br/>As Stan Winston's final foray into the Terminator Universe, this film was done well, the effects well placed and not overbearing, the characters multilayered and fresh, the story a good overall Terminator Action/SciFi story, McG did much better on this than I expected he would. after Charlie's Angels.<br/><br/>As this film was supposed to be the first of a ""New Trilogy"" and reboot of the Terminator Franchise, I can only hope, that the ownership issues are leveled out, and that a new Terminator film can be made that follows the future as laid out here... Because the Wright character can return, we see how easily he was rebuilt as Skynet... And we know he can re-appear, even though his heart now beats in John Connor's Chest.<br/><br/>This film, in my opinion put the same new life that Marcus Wright gave John Connor, to the Terminator Multiverse."
"elshikh4","2","3","6","24 November 2010"," Terminator: An Early-Terminated Franchise !
","Once upon a time, James Cameron wrote & directed a movie. It made big bucks. Did I say that that happened in a town named Hollywood? Because there that means: sequels. Lots and lots of them. The thing is, this time, I don't care!<br/><br/>Simply I don't like the previous 3 Terminator movies. The first was a sci-fi slasher movie, with 2 chased persons; a woman and a helper good guy (lovers to be), being chased by a violent Terminator (played with mega coolness by Schwarzenegger). The second was a repetition of the first, with 2 chased persons (mother and son), Schwarzenegger as the helper good guy, all being chased again by a violent Terminator (with some historic, really great, CGI). The third is more repetition, with 2 chased persons (lovers to be again), Schwarzenegger as the helper good guy again, all being chased by a violent Terminator again and again however played by a girl this time. I slightly enjoyed it, not as a sci-fi or an action, but for its first-time ironic remarks towards Schwarzenegger's character (or anything). As you see, it's a game of switching cards, while the attractive sides get poorer, and the plot gets thinner!<br/><br/>They could have made a fourth one with 2 chased persons (father and daughter), Schwarzenegger as the helper good guy in fully animated cartoon, all being chased by a violent Terminator yet played by a kid. Well, sure that could have been better and newer than what I watched!<br/><br/>(T 4) can lose the patience to watch, and to review rationally. It's sick to read all the time ""From the producers of The Terminator"", ""Form the mentality that brought to you so and so"". Because here it doesn't mean a thing. Even if we talked about it as enjoyable waste of time.<br/><br/>While being the no slasher formula, and so expensive movie as well, it got even more poor and thin. It has no story, just some excuses to fabricate chases. It repines about the machines while we saw none of their leaders, or understand what their agenda is. It looks written by a machine itself, because nothing human about it. Not a comic relief or even a good line. Many points seem copied from other movies; the love story between a runner and a girl (Part 1), the mighty enemy dies at the end then comes back (Part 2), the matter of the buddy kid (Cameron's other movie Aliens!).<br/><br/>Christian Bale isn't the lead of it (a woe). Sam Worthington is (an extreme woe!). However I can't blame him alone, the script gave him nothing to do but to jump around. By the way, we were made to believe that John Connor is the one and only leader of the future, to find that he's usual guy (AND AFTER 4 MOVIES ALREADY, HE DIDN'T SHOW A PROOF OF EXCELLENCE YET!!).<br/><br/>No one knows what's meant by ""Salvation"" in the title?! Is it the salvation of Worthington's character from being a machine to be human? But even if, he was human all along!! It could have been more interesting if he was a helper man, then we discover that he's a double agent / machine who, at last, gets sympathetic, helping the humans, sacrificing for them, to live his ""Salvation"" anyway. But no such luck!<br/><br/>I didn't understand why Worthington had to be someone who almost traveled from previous time? Or from where exactly this apocalyptic society brings its fuel and vegetables? If the lead exploded the factory of the human-like machines (Arnie in a terrible CG-ed cameo), how it'll go into the past?! And the most bugging one: If the machines are so BIG themselves, why to produce a human-like type? Or rather why not to travel back in time, by themselves, not to murder John Connor, but to take over the world?!!<br/><br/>It's absurd explosion after another, with a huge irritating emptiness in between. I pitied Christian Bale. He's a fine actor, so what brought you here pal? He tried his best to be serious and deep in a movie that has nothing serious or deep. The action isn't genius. Only the sequence in the middle of the movie (the lorry chase) which is above average. The fighter motorcycles was a good addition, but not in a good movie though. It ends with weak battle, lower than the aforementioned one. It's clear that this movie gives no satisfying thing!<br/><br/>It's Hollywood at its poorest and richest conditions. Poorest ideas and entertainment. And richest, rather craziest, budgets ever. Can you imagine that this heavily dull and tasteless movie was made by 200 millions dollars?!! And I thought that Titanic, with 200 million and sure better shape, was not that good movie! With a sum like this, America can make a university for studying cinema, maybe it would graduate more brilliant scriptwriters who wouldn't waste millions on garbage under the name of Blockbuster anymore!<br/><br/>So if you search for some escaping time from your pathetic life, then this one will teach you how your life isn't that pathetic after all. According to the 3 sequels, I believe that (The Terminator - 1984) was better being left alone. They aren't uninteresting movies only, but unnecessary in the first place. 2 of them copied the first with no clue about what's later. Then that later couldn't find something respectful of any kind to present. What confuses me isn't who made these movies? I know; people who are greedy or ignorant (or both). It's who does enjoy them?!!<br/><br/>Finally, 3 too similar not great movies. Their only bright points, Schwarzenegger's coolness and part 2's CGI, weren't here. So if this very expensive, bad, fourth one says something; then it's the fact about (Terminator) as one of the most unnecessary franchises ever made!"

","Let's start with the good, governator (Arnie) CGI is unbelievably amazing. And that's it.<br/><br/>Now for the Bad. We have a case of missing story. I can't explain why a 200 Million Dollar film would not invest a single dollar in buying some pencils. Anyways, now that I have started to write this review and you have started to read it, let's salvage the situation, by poking some fun.<br/><br/>In the Letterman tradition, let's do a 'top 10' speculating the reasons the movie team would give for the missing story:<br/><br/>10: We spent 200 mil on the damn robot, ran out of budget for pencils. 9: We thought the Terminator brand and the Dark Knight was all that would be required for the movie. 8: Our dogs ate our story. 7: We saw the first two terminator movies and gave up, can't beat those. 6: We were copying Bollywood (But these days even they have stories. errr Can we take back this excuse?). 5: We watched too many Jerry Springer reruns, and then we couldn't think. 4: We spent all of our time playing with the Terminator dolls and talking in Arnold's voice /Hasta la vista baby/. 3: Since LA was destroyed during Judgement Day, all the writers were dead. 2: The Terminators terminated our writer's contract. <br/><br/>And the number one reason why we don't have a story is >> 1: If Avatar doesn't need a story, then why do we?<br/><br/>In the earlier movies the machines came to our world with a target, which was clear to understand. In this movie, since we have been taken to their world, where the machines have already (almost) destroyed the planet, their motivation to do so is not at all clear. Why do they want to eliminate mankind and what do they gain from it?<br/><br/>When the terminators came to our world in the earlier movies it was imperative for them to look like us, that was understandable. But in their world why do they need to emulate human life form (T600/700/800)? If anything, that would be an impediment for them to have only two eyes and walk with human like legs etc etc....<br/><br/>OK, I have a long list of complaints, but since no matter how much I try, I am not going to get my 2 hours back. Lets cut to the chase and conclude the review.<br/><br/>McG and Christian Bale cannot save this. Christian, I became a big fan after watching the very disturbing The Machinist. This was disappointing.<br/><br/>Frankly I was surprised that they got their money back and then some.<br/><br/>______________________<br/><br/>Now, here's what I would have changed if I was in control.<br/><br/>* For me, this one is beyond saving, a complete flush/rewrite is required.<br/><br/>This review was originally posted on my blog: http://roundhayreview.blogspot.com/2010/01/terminator-salvation.html"

","Doesn't make sense in the Terminator series. Hollywood wanted to make a movie about two robot fighting each other. Do not waste your time. Could have easily been a great movie with a rebel force rising up against an evil super power i.e. Star Wars. I guess Hollywood thought it was too close to home with the wars in the middle east. Made a mindless flick about a robot super agent. Who's jog it is to bring its target back to base. Why would a remorseless killing machine want to let the race it is trying to exterminate into its base? To let it blow it up, of course. Sorry i rented it, thank god I didn't see it in the theater."

","Terminator 2 was the first movie of the series that i watched when i was just a kid and so i practically grew up with Arnie as a role-model fighting machine...it was such fun to enact him before the mirror and deliver his one-liners from the film. It sort of made you feel powerful to an extent.<br/><br/>After that i watched Terminator and Terminator: Rise of the Machines. And although none of these movies were as good as T2 but they were still worth watching several times primarily because of Arnie playing the role of Terminator. No matter how many characters they add up into the series Arnie is the life and blood of this series. Without him the Terminator universe cannot exist. However, this was not my view before I watched this movie.<br/><br/>When it was announced that Christian Bale (who is one of my favorite actors) would play John Connor I was really delighted. Bale is one of the most sensitive actors around and i felt that even after Arnie's absence, he would bring new life to the series. I was waiting for a long time for John Connor to take charge of the franchise and i thought that the happy day had come. I was seriously anticipating a breathtaking movie but was utterly shocked by what i received.<br/><br/>Bale was absolutely passive in the entire movie and had not a single smart action sequence to his credit in the entire movie. I couldn't see his leadership qualities...in fact, i couldn't see the humanity in his character. He appeared more machine-like than even the actual machines and that is not all right for the movie. I know it is quite feasible that waging a long and losing battle could make any person grim and serious but it doesn't exactly mean that you've to always maintain a staring expression on your face. I have seen him playing grimmer roles in grimmer situations (Equilibrium and even the Batman series) and in a way, he always looked a heroic figure in all those roles. Here, he was like a mere shadow overburdened by expectations. He should act like a figure of inspiration whereas he felt a demoralizing military commander. This was what destroyed the film for me.<br/><br/>Whatever stars i've given is because of that brilliant chase sequence (Sam Worthington is true class, for sure) and that brief period of film where Arnie steps in. Even though he was digitally portrayed but that was the only time in the film when i actually sat up in attention feeling that something good would happen in the movie now...at least once!!!"

","This is the sequel we never wanted, with the director we never wanted. A film that was made hoping to make a lot of money because of the fanbase, but really just annoyed the Terminator fanboys straight away.<br/><br/>Terminator Salvation is the first Terminator film that does not have a Terminator going back in time with the mission to kill John Connor in some way or form. This one film looks at the war between the Human Resistance and the Machines after the nuclear war known as Judgement Day. Set in 2018, John Connor (Christian Bale) has been an iconic but rebellious member of the resistance. He leads a team in the fight against the machines. In a raid his team receive information about a signal that could disable the machine and win the war for humanity. They also discovery that the machines have a kill list, with Kyle Reese (Anton Yelchin) on the top of it. During the raid, Marcus Wright (Sam Worthington), a convicted killer is awaken from suspended animation. He is shocked to discover that Los Andreas is a hollow deserted city and ends up meeting Kyle Reese and a mute child (Jadagrace Berry). Along his travels Reese is captured and he ends up joining the resistance. He becomes their best hope at stopping the machines.<br/><br/>I wanted to like this, there was some potential and no way it could have been worst then Terminator 3. I think critics were willing to brash this film for two reasons, first misjudging T3 (which was T2 made as a parody), and simply because McG directed this film. There are some positives, there are some good action sequences, especially when the Terminator was on the screen, references to the previous films, and Sam Worthington was very good in this film.<br/><br/>But there are a lot of problems with this film that really held it back. I am also critical of McG as a director. He is a music video director who only knows how to direct 3 to 4 minute sequences. He is not good at story or character direction and he over stylises scenes, like when John Connor tried to take off in the helicopter. He over edits, and there are scenes when the camera can't stay still when it really should. He is not good at directing actors. The film lacked the dark and gritty feel it really needed, some moments were be a bit too melodramatic. It wasn't dirty enough, compared to Lord of the Rings where you believed in the medieval style world it was set in. Some of the ideas and scenes were pretty much copied from other films. These include, The Mute Child (Mad Max 2), Steady Cam Battle Scene (Children of Men), The jet plane dog fight (Independence Day), the human harvesting (War of the Worlds (2005)), the radio messages (I Am Legend), some of the robot designs (Iron Man), the CPR scene and the bridge attack (Mission Impossible III). But McG can direct an action scene, and more then a glorfied camera man like Brett Ratner. He can do smaller projects like We Are Marshall and should do more to build up his skill level. And really needs to change his name, because a grown man should not call himself McG!<br/><br/>But I think the main problem with the film is the script. It was written by John Brancato and Michael Ferris, who wrote the Terminator 3 and Catwoman (not good signs). It was rewritten a lot by Paul Haggis, Shawn Ryan, Johnathan Nolan and Anthony E. Zuiker, even during the middle of filming. It shows because some of the dialogue was weak, stiff or overdone: in T1 and T2 it was so cool, but not in this. The story too was nothing special, with both the writers and McG not sure whether to focus on Marcus or John Connor. The story reminded me of a Sonic the Hedgehog fanfiction which was a lot better then this script (and I really mean that because it was the fanfiction was well written). This Terminator film also suffers from a lack of a Terminator as either a good or bad guy. He is a compelling forces because of his power. There were ideas that were not used well, like the fine line between man and machine who how would humanity survive a post nuclear world. I also felt the resistance shouldn't have been an organised military force, but more a guerrilla force like the Viet-con or the Iraqi insurgency. This was meant to be the point when humanity was loosing really badly. Kyle Reese in the first film stated that he was born in a machine camp and it was John Connor who saved him. That should have been shown and not him fighting alone in LA. If the story was stronger, it might have worked better as a stand alone film.<br/><br/>Whilst Sam Worthington was good in this film, most of the actors didn't do so well. Christian Bale, an actor I like a lot and normally picks his films very carefully, is on auto-pilot in this film. This is particularly specially because he had a famous rant when on set and he was staying in character when it happened. Common as Bale's second in command was really poor and wooden, and it must have been a struggle to carry him in the film. Bryce Dallas Howard was underused, and Helena Bonham Carter, one of my favourite actress didn't give her role her all. Moon Bloodgood and Anton Yelchin were decent, but their character's lacked depth, especially Moon Bloodgood.<br/><br/>The trailer pretty much shown the best scenes of the film.<br/><br/>For the Terminator film no one wanted I give it a 2 out of 5. I wanted to like it but ended up getting disengaged with it. I think a director like Bryan Singer or Darren Aronofsky could have done so much more with it."

","James Cameron's stock rises with every passing sci-fi action movie that is released these days. The man who practically invented and certainly perfected the genre with Aliens and the first two Terminator films has watched his legacy be steadily diluted by today's imitators, and Terminator Salvation is a grisly reminder of just what Cameron did to make his films so special.<br/><br/>There's not much wrong with Salvation in technical terms. McG may deserve the cries of ""MTV director"" simply for his ludicrous, gimmicky alias but his style is competent enough, reigning in the whizz-bang editing and over-processed shots. The film looks nice enough: the special effects are very good, the action well staged and the overall look and feel of the film is pretty-yet-gritty. It's certainly better to look at than your typical, overblown Michael Bay product.<br/><br/>No, what makes Terminator Salvation so poor is not in how it looks, sounds or moves. This is, quite simply, a film of colossal stupidity, stupidity that is rendered even more starkly because it has to stand up to Cameron's films.<br/><br/>Where to start? How about with its utter disdain for continuity? In the original Terminator film, Cameron managed in a couple of simple monologues from Kyle Reese to provide both crucial exposition and paint a bleak picture of a future where humanity is enslaved by the machines and on the very verge of extinction before John Connor's intervention. McG spends a whole film carefully trashing Cameron's vision. Humanity isn't enslaved in a high tech circle of hell, it's a fully functioning resistance force with worldwide forces, aircraft and submarine command centres. John Connor doesn't lead the stragglers out of machine death camps to fight a desperate guerrilla war, he's a bizarrely mythologised sergeant in a clichÃ©-spouting military unit, complete with stereotypically uncooperative superiors running the show.<br/><br/>Even worse, the entire mise en scene of those future flashback sequences from Reese's hallucinations and the intro to Terminator 2 is thrown out of the window. Gone is the perpetual dark of nuclear winter, the bed of human skulls and the desperate struggle by ill equipped survivors. Instead the film looks more like Mad Max meets Black Hawk Down.<br/><br/>McG commits the obvious mistake of putting his ego over the wants of the fans. Terminator fans don't want some snotty upstart director trying to impose his ill-fitting creative vision on their iconic series. Why is this behaviour tolerated by Hollywood studios? The practise is so common we have a term for it now: retconning. McG retcons the backstory and feel of a winning and much-loved formula devised by a much better director in a display of either colossal naivety or extreme arrogance. And he fails.<br/><br/>What's really insulting, however, is how he attempts to wean the fanbase onto his new direction for the Terminator universe not by compromise or humbleness but by feeding the fans endless references to previous films, in the thick-headed belief that meaningless echoes to the old films will placate the fans. From repeated dialogue to carbon copy shots to You Could Be Mine blasting out of a boom box, McG lathers the film with self-referentiality and prays that the audiences are too busy fist-pumping and cheering at these moments to care what he does to the parts that matter.<br/><br/>Of course, it's possible I'm being too cynical. Terminator Salvation references, imitates or just plain rips off so many other sci-fi films it's possible that McG is simply a postmodern magpie who has so few ideas of his own he can only get by through creating a collage of nods to other, better films. These nods are especially weak when you put them against Cameron's intelligent subversion, expansion and development of key moments and motifs from his original film in Terminator 2. In comparison, McG looks nothing better than a film student smugly quoting lines from his favourite movies.<br/><br/>Special mention must go to the plot, which is so laughably bad I'm giving this review spoilers so I can properly skewer it. Set aside all the aforementioned retconning and inconsistencies and just marvel at the dumbness of a plot that rips off the Matrix Reloaded as hard as possible and falls short even of that. <br/><br/>A ""chosen one"" figure leads a human resistance against an oppressive machine hegemony in a post-apocalyptic future, only for it to be revealed that the entire plot of the film is a carefully laid trap by a controlling machine intelligence, you say? And where Reloaded's climactic twist was merely the end of intelligent plotting in that particular franchise, Salvation's twist is the revelation that the plot you've been following is actually considerably more stupid than previously suspected. It turns out Marcus Wright is resurrected by Skynet to set an elaborate plan to lead John Connor to Skynet, through the bait of a captured Kyle Reese. Watch this film again and consider just how much chance, coincidence and sheer luck is involved in Marcus Wright even meeting John Connor, let alone leading him to Skynet and you'll scoff at the very notion that Skynet could possibly have planned for the events you witness. And that's before you even question why the machines don't murder Reese on sight and end the whole shambolic mess 30 minutes before the closing credits.<br/><br/>I'd love to tell you how my friends and I laughed out loud at Christian Bale's delivery of several lines, how we're still making jokes about how a 300 ton giant robot ninja'd its way across open desert to ambush the protagonists in one scene and about the clumsy retreading of those tired man/machine subtexts we've been wearing into the sci-fi carpet since before Blade Runner, but this review is already too long. James Cameron will smirk yet again as we're reminded that it's not set pieces and special effects that make a good sci-fi action film: it's all about good writing and smart directing."
"jguz58","2","3","6","18 August 2009"," Seriously, who writes this crap?
","I thought Terminator 3 was kind of a letdown, but then what wouldn't be, after T2? So I was willing to give this movie a shot, hoping that it would help redeem the series, and put it back on the right track.<br/><br/>Terminator Salvation fails dismally. Other than some cool effects (e.g. Hunter-Killers), tell me, just how does this differ from all the other ""super-action films"" that have been churned out over the last several years? Characters that you don't care about, going through some elaborate, fast-cutting action scenes that nobody could even remotely survive, let alone get up and start running again. You would think that even the supposed 'humans' were enhanced with invincible strength.<br/><br/>The kid that plays Kyle Reese is the most interesting portrayal here, the rest aren't much worth watching. I'm very glad that I only paid $1 to see this. I feel sorry for the schmucks that ran out and paid full price for it when it first came out.<br/><br/>I'm going to stick with the first 2 Terminator movies, and do my best to pretend they never made any sequels after that."
"RichardKleiner","8","3","6","3 August 2009"," The work betrays the original concept, but it's still a pretty decent action flick.
","I entered the theater with low expectations. James Cameron's low budget sci-fi thriller is still a classic in cinema, and it sure started several careers in the process. The sequel came, with bigger effects, old and new actors and it did deliver. This was both a blessing and a curse for Cameron, as the characters and world he created made him a name in Hollywood and also gave the studios one big franchise to squeeze it's juice from. When Part 3 came without the director's involvement (or blessing), it was a sign that the franchise had left Cameron.<br/><br/>While I found part 3 quite fun and full of facts about the war of the future worthy of attention, it sure wasn't the best. And I haven't seen the Sarah Chronicles TV series, because I thought THAT was too much. No Arnie meant no real direction.<br/><br/>And, with news that this Terminator was the first of a new trilogy, it won't be odd if you think this movie will have money as it's target more than artistry.<br/><br/>The movie has it's fair amount of characters, unfortunately, little exposition is given about them and more exposition is given about stuff people who've seen any Terminator movie already know. The character of Blair is just given a brief intro hanging from the parachute, Marcus merely chats with her and she's already willing to die for him. Who? What? Where? Guess nobody cares if they try to explain that. SPOILER: Marcus, the character we know little much about, is a Terminator, but feels human. Although I may sound pretentious, I could tell he was. Showing out of nowhere without clothes? Knowing how to disarm a kid? Feeling nothing when he's hit?<br/><br/>The movie in itself is entertaining. It's action sequences sure are fun and exciting, and the overall story works. The big Terminator gathering humans may work, but it's so Transformers it doesn't surprise you (though considering that sequel's awfulness, it's more effective)<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the story does venture in the realm of formulaic unimaginative action plot, with a particular scene where the main Skynet computer in the voice and face of Helena Bonham Carter reveals the whole plan to Marcus. Hello? I thought we were passed the age of movies where the villain exposed his entire scheme to the hero. I'm not a McG fan. Both Charlie's Angels movies are not good examples to brag about. Still, in this movie he manages to tell a compelling war story with pretty good shots. The one shot sequence where John Connor flies a helicopter is my personal favorite.<br/><br/>SPOILER: The classic T-800 (not the real Arnie, but a stand-in with a CGI face) makes an appearance. However, due to the fact that the Governor of California can't be in the movie, they rushed the action so he could get torched and lose the skin tissue. Still, that particular scene is quite gripping, despite said cheesy ploy.<br/><br/>The score by Danny Elfman, with only three brief renditions to the famous beat pattern (The Ta-ti-ta-ti-ta is not the entire theme, people), may be good if you define good as emulating the styles of Hans Zimmer, Graeme Revell and Marco Beltrami. But, the music works. Oh, and you can hear ""You Could Be Mine"" on a radio, which is a nice reference.<br/><br/>By the way, the movie is filled with other references to all the Terminator movies, from the iconic lines ""Come with me..."" and ""I'll be back"" to similar entire sequences and settings.<br/><br/>The ending is left open for, of course, more sequels, but there were few who thought otherwise. As long as the Terminators keep gathering fans, the movies will keep going. As least they could endeavor in making them as fun and exciting as this, but maybe a tad smarter.<br/><br/>The story was worth telling, but as a movie, it betrays the concept of the previous three. The originals had the tension and conflict all happening in present day, with the future deliberately left unclear and only shown via flashes in the character's memories or imagination. In Salvation, the story just focuses on the action happening at that time. It does include a particular time paradox, but they don't take advantage of it.<br/><br/>It may have been more respectful as a spin-off novel. But, hey, at least it doesn't suck."

This movie is good and its worth watching. i was satisfied with the story line. i recommended everyone to watch this movie.Try to get hold up with the previous episodes. but the main problem with the movie is having too many face changes. its kinda bad for squeal movies. Well i am not telling this movie is squeal. Its actually Prequel. You will find out if you finish the whole story. The whole story goes well with all 4 episodes. and more excitement coming up i think. The more interesting part was existence of Schwarzenegger. OWO.

"Sirus_the_Virus","5","3","6","29 July 2009"," You know who should be back? James Cameron.
","In the 80's and the 90's director James Cameron directed two cult classics. The Terminator and T2: Judgement Day. Both had a very complex story lines. In 2003, Terminator 3 came out,and there wasn't much complex storytelling there. In 2009, Terminator:Salvation came out and I'm unsure if there was much of a story at all. The newest film may be the worst, but I didn't particually think it was a bad film. I had somewhat high hopes for it. I wanted to see Helena Bonham Carter appear. She did... for a ten minute appearance.She was a big purpose in the story plot though.Usually, Christian Bale chooses big roles. He is supposed to be the main character, but Marcus(Sam Worthington) has more of a role than him.There are dozens of people starring in it. Maybe not dozens but there's quite a bit. There are a few references from other Terminator films.Arnold Swartzeneggar makes a somewhat appearance. Though it's not because all they used was an animation of some sort.John's father Kyle Reese(played by Anton Yelchin)is in it also. If you saw the first film, Kyle Reese came from the future and protected John Conner's mother.And died trying.The new Terminator film has special effects galore. And I guess it's somewhat worth seeing.But MCG,the director, tries to distract us from the film's plot and story and makes us watch explosion after explosion after explosion.I'm not saying Terminator:Salvation is a bad film,but it's not as good as some of the other Summer films."
"akayz_people","7","3","6","27 July 2009"," Not as Bad as I thought it would be
","OK, before I watched it I was prepared to think that it wouldn't ever be better than the first 2 terminators, because its pretty obvious... its like saying that Godfather 3 would ever be as good as the first 2, and its actually impossible<br/><br/>Terminator Salvation has a great concept, I loved the game Fallout 3 with all the post apocalyptic shizzle, and with a budget of 200 mil, this movie delivers SLICK environments, believable is the word. <br/><br/>The performances weren't bad, Bale was well suited as John Connor, Worthington did very well. The relationships were enjoyable to watch, how the characters came together well and how they reacted with each other. <br/><br/>The plot was a bit fishy in my mind, but it was pretty basic, you'd have to be stupid not to understand what is going on. I can't get all the whining about the plot, because its not an overused plot like before. <br/><br/>Special Effects, this is where the movie scores well, all the explosion sequences and war scenes were brilliantly executed, I loved the stunt work too. The music wasn't too bad, again it was better in places than Terminator 3. <br/><br/>To sum up, this movie surprised me, I didn't expect it to be as slick as it was 7/10<br/><br/>not perfect, but not bad either :)"
"lysis_nikolaidis","8","3","6","27 July 2009"," Terminator Reset
","Finally, after the rather useless and self-mocking T3, we got a reset. Of course, the third movie was fun to watch, but you won't miss a thing if you stick to 1, 2 and 4.<br/><br/>No 4 is the real sequel to the brilliant first two movies. It shows true respect to the original story. Of course it has its flaws, which you fatalist whiners didn't fail to point out on several occasions.<br/><br/>The new cast is a very good selection; Sam Worthington is amazing! Okay, I know Christian Bale can do better, but he doesn't get a lot of chances to do ""philosophy"" and he doesn't have to. The existence of Markus is enough kick start the brain. The effects are solid, but I guess nothing surprises us anymore since T2.<br/><br/>Honestly guys, get over your heartaches of losing Arnie and James Cameron. And even if some people really believe they made Terminator, the one character i miss the most is Sarah Connor. But we have to move on. Neither of the three will be back.<br/><br/>You are the ones who behave pathetic. After shitty Sarah Connor Chronicles and ridiculous T3 we really do have a reset here. So stop having a whinge for crying out loud!"
"gertru007","3","3","6","26 July 2009"," A major disappointment
","Like millions others I am a very big fan of the Terminator series. In my wait for the movie I watched both the seasons of ""The Sarah Connor Chronicles"" only to watch this movie and regret it.<br/><br/>The first Turn Off was the PG-13 rating that really took away so much potential from the action scenes. The second was Christian Bale trying too hard with no actual conviction. And the third most horrid part was the mere stupidity of carrying pea-shooters when they already knew they can't even scratch cyborgs with it. This is something that i realized in the TV series as well. I kept thinking why has it never crossed their mind to send a team to the past for research and development of weapons that would actually hurt these machines.<br/><br/>Okay I have some reservations for John Connor as well. The legend that he is portrayed to be through out the series require some special skill for the audience to acknowledge his importance. It is the first time that we get the chance to see The John Connor that the machines fear.Yet he's just shown as a paranoid soldier with some hind knowledge of these machines. No special skill like being a genius for making a killer virus that would eventually kill Sky Net or a natural born instinctive soldier with the agility that the machines find hard to match (with at least the T-600/T-800 models) or any other specialty that would ultimately lead to the fall of the machines. But instead he is just a common soldier forced by circumstances to become the leader of the Resistance. In the current scenario i don't see why no one else can replace him as a leader of the Resistance.<br/><br/>One star was my initial rating but for the return of T-800 (Arnold), which was really the best scene of the movie, I am giving it 3 stars."
"dfle3","7","3","6","23 July 2009"," The future isn't what it used to be...
","It's been a few weeks since I've seen this film, but I remember it being a good 'popcorn' type of movie. In some ways the world it creates is in line with what the re-imagined Star Trek movie did (also released in 2009). So, if you hate what has been done in this movie, it's possible to rationalise and to hope for a better attempt at a sequel-reimagination. If you love this movie, then the world which this movie creates will be your preferred Terminator world.<br/><br/>For me, this is by no means a great movie. It's entertaining but that's about it. Not sure that it has any repeat viewing value. Like I said, the world which this movie creates doesn't seem to gel with what we came to expect based on the earlier movies. Not into the mythology of this series enough to know whether paradoxes or contradictions are created.<br/><br/>By far the most interesting character in this movie is Marcus Wright, played by Sam Worthington. He's a mystery character whom John Connor (played by Christian Bale) does not know whether to trust or not...is Wright a man or a machine? Friend or foe?<br/><br/>For the second time in the last few years, Bale has been upstaged by an Australian co-star...the last time was with Heath Ledger's immortal characterisation of The Joker in ""The Dark Knight"" Batman movie. It looks to me as if Bale is going down the route of trying to make a lot of money in movies...he's betting that there will be a Terminator series of sequels starring him, and that he'll make a fortune from them. Unfortunately, like Batman, John Connor is rather dull and a blank canvas. The parts which actors would jump at, like The Joker and Marcus Wright, are infinitely more interesting than the box office heroes Bale is playing...perhaps this truth galls Bale so much that he would be inclined to verbally abuse crew members making Terminator: Salvation?<br/><br/>Anyway, lots of action in this movie, which is well done, and I did find the twists that this movie brought up to be interesting. Maybe other fans of this series will find those twists to be more of a problem for them than I did. Can't say that I am locking in viewing any subsequent movies in this series. The Transformers sequel has killed my desire to see any more movies in that franchise. Whilst having more action than this movie, Transformers is a whole lot less interesting and entertaining...but you would never guess that going on its extraordinary box office success."
"alien-90","6","3","6","21 July 2009"," Good Science Fiction !
","When I read the comments on this movie it makes me wonder just what exactly most of these self-appointed critics were expecting. <br/><br/>I expected nothing really, but I have a fair amount of trust in whatever project Christian Bale is involved in at the moment.<br/><br/>The film takes on a new direction in the franchise, and the future setting allows it. This was badly needed after the mediocre third installment. <br/><br/>I do feel however that this movie is more enjoyable for fans of old school science fiction than perhaps for modern day action fans. <br/><br/>I for one really enjoyed this movie and I am ready for the fifth !"
"gregfalla","4","3","6","15 July 2009"," My rating was for the effects
","Explosions, big budget, robots and Christian Bale; normally very enticing features. But this movie was diabolical. It dragged on and the story could have been completed within half an hour. Trim the fat and make a better movie. The effects however were mindblowing, unlike the script. McG did a great job directing but with so many plot holes and confusions within the script it beggars belief why the hell Christian Bale signed up to this crap. With rumours of a fifth one to take place in modern day Britain of all places, this needs to be terminated; now. The time line set up in the previous films are almost discarded within this one and the fifth film in the series. I know die-hard terminator fans will slate my review but the truth needs to be heard. Can script writers actually come up with a decent script? With depth, surprising twists (that make sense even due to their surprise), interesting story lines and no plot holes? You can relate script writers to a famous saying; something about monkeys, typewriters and Shakespeare; except the monkey could come up with a better script than the one here."
"unknowndisorder-1","1","3","6","3 July 2009"," Came back, James Cameron!
","The director James Cameron created two classics of the fiction: "" The Terminator"" (1984) and ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day"" (1991) they are two deep films with a frightful and pessimistic vision of the future, beyond one original question raised on the time to pass in cyclical and not linear way.<br/><br/>However, when attending "" Terminator Salvation"" this forgets everything! After all of accounts, the script does not respect in nothing the original story, only the names John Connor, Kyle Reese and Skynet. The great quality of Cameron was to create a film of entertainment with deep messages. McG does not obtain this, it only created a film of explosions, that any director of Hollywood obtains to make. But also, what to wait of who it made ""Charlie Angels""? <br/><br/>And if ""Terminator 3: Rise Of Machine"" (2003) already it was a great one confronts to the two classics of James Cameron, "" Salvation"" it goes beyond and it destroys all the concepts created in the last productions. Nothing if saved in this film, not even Christian Bale, in one of the worse performances of the career. And the worse one of everything is possible that they make a fifth film. Please, James Cameron, return! They are finishing with everything what you made!"

Why not, um, I dunno, vaporise him?? That would make sense, right?!?! Terminators, robots designed by robots to kill humans, can be disabled by a knife, or similar pointy object, to the back of the head. WTF?!?! Were they designed by microsoft? That's a pretty huge design flaw if you ask me. And why do terminators like to play wrestler when dealing with humans ... throwing them through walls and stuff?? Wouldn't they just, I dunno, take your head off with one punch, given they can punch through walls and stuff? And the bit where the good terminator kills that flying tracking machine thing with ... wait for it ... a tire-iron!?!?!? Again, why is Skynet, a super-intelligent, self-aware artificial intelligence, so crap at machine design? Why, for instance, did Skynet decide to include external controls on the motorbike terminator robot things so John Conner could nick one and ride it around? You'd think a self-aware killer motorbike wouldn't really need handlebars.<br/><br/>There are many, many other plot holes and inconsistencies, and just plain stupid things, in this film that I can't be arsed getting into.

I'm getting sick and tired of this Prequel Star Wars abomination film making. CGI destroys the feeling of suspense right there! It's just not good enough yet sorry. Timing is also everything, not so great there either. Cameo Arnold looked roughly OK for being what he was,(spoiler) not Arnold, but that's beside the point. The cutting was frenetic and didn't contain any real calm spots where the plot could have been developed(like the car sequence and Reese talking about the future in the first Terminator movie). I guess it's because there is no real substantial plot in this movie. It's all BS IMO.

Terminator: Salvation is a stunning train wreck of a movie. While watching, you think back to Christian Bale's leaked meltdown in which he went off on the Director of Photography, and you begin to sympathize with the actor. The thought of signing up to appear in this disaster has the potential to inflict serious damage on his star power in Hollywood. What has happened to the Bale of American Psycho and The Machinist? The flashes of brilliance he showed in those films have all but disappeared, and now appears to be a serious contender for a razzie. Don't believe the ""we were filming a very serious scene"" excuse. This is a film about Robots fighting each other. Bale must realize the intention of appearing in mindless summer fare such as this is to not try and one up Brando In The Godfather.<br/><br/>Director ""McG"" apparently felt it would be a good idea to make T4 seem like a ripoff of The Tranformers. This ""director"" may think he has a hip moniker, but his approach to this material is anything but. Bale will most likely look back on this experience as the bad decision which drove him to suffer an emotional breakdown, where he assaulted family members and lashed out at co-workers. Hopefully more audio recordings surface, because I can assure you he was going off Glengarry Glen Ross style on people behind the scenes every chance he got, and I cannot blame him. Hearing those would no doubt be 100,000 times more entertaining than the steaming piece of excrement called T4 - the franchise-killing finale to a once great science-fiction series.<br/><br/>""I Won't Be Back"" Ah-nuld may as well have said during his CGI-ed cameo."

","I was rather skeptical before seeing this movie. Director, setting change - it all could mean huge failure. It didn’t.<br/><br/>This movie feels like it was made by not just terminator fans, but it often makes you feel like you are watching a movie from ten to twenty years ago, and in a good way. There are scenes that manage to capture the essence of what made Terminator 2, Aliens and so forth, movies fun. Only for that i would gladly give this movie high ranking. It doesn’t play with pricey CGI to make your jaw drop, it manages to blend everything cinema has to offer to make you feel like you are there.<br/><br/>Script itself is good. Not great, and has certain issues, but it does its job at changing the setting well, while also keeping the feel of old movies intact. We follow Connor and Marcus, and them alone. If, instead, we had to witness a full-scale anti-machine war, we would get another Matrix Revolutions - something that Terminator shouldn't be.<br/><br/>Acting is a mix. While key cast is great for the most part, Bayle indeed haven't got enough to play with. His character feels more terminator-like than Worthington's. This fact itself can be disappointing, but since we all know well that Bayle can pull off a kick-ass performance, that just means that this impression of the character was intentional. He, Connor, is not a kid anymore. From the childhood he was being prepared for a war and by now he is nothing else but a soldier, and it shows.<br/><br/>Action scenes are played out in the way that fits with what i wrote before: you rarely will see camera fly away to show you the whole scene. Instead, you are there, running from machines. Sad part is that while you do feel like it, its just not terminator 1/2 anyway : there is no feeling of what can best be described as ""holy crap, how do i kill this thing? it keeps following me, no way i can survive that!"". Thankfully, this is the only shortcoming, and i feel its rather personal one, because there are scenes that clearly directed to make you feel that way, but for some reason they didn't work for me.<br/><br/>Speaking of shortcomings, plot-wise there is only one and i wont spoil it. Ill just point out that there is one unreasonable decision being made in a movie that feels rather forced. Its not too major, but not minor either, so it does subtract from the final score.<br/><br/>And i would rate this movie with solid 8, or even more. Not 10, clearly - but it certainly a worthwhile watch for everyone."
"nebulous-life","2","3","6","4 June 2009"," I want my 10$ back Warner Bros.
","*SPOILERS* (not that it really matters)<br/><br/>Terminator salvation is a film that straight up blinds with CG. When you are in the theater you think the film is passable, maybe a 5 out of 10. However give it an hour or two and you will start to rethink the film and then you realize just how big of a **** pile this film really is. What this film really seems to be is a bunch of Terminator fan-boys just smashed together a bunch of ""Wouldn't it be really cool if"" scenes without really coming up with a plot.<br/><br/>Now for specifics, I will start with the art direction / set design. Most of the machines in this film are the least logical robots you can think of, a robot/super-bike that is only really going to work on paved roads, most of witch are covered in rubble or destroyed? Also Skynet doesn't resemble anything close to what it was described as in the original films, pyramid anyone? Also there are huge robots rounding up people for no reason (war of the worlds?), the entire plot of the Terminator films is based on a future where legions of robots are spreading across the world exterminating the population after nuking most major cities. I also would like to know why in every shot inside where Skynet keeps all the humans there are random balls of fire being released everywhere? If you are designing a machine world everything needs to be based on logic, if it serves no purpose there is no need to build it, if it does not maximizes its usability it won't be used. Random vents ejecting fire to a prison area seems perfectly logical to me. In Terminator 2 we saw a short scene where a large troop of humanoid robots just tearing through and killing everything in sight, which makes sense since the machines would be versatile, strong, and since they are humanoid they can go wherever we can. But the only machines we see aren't anywhere close to this, I know they are supposed to be older models but still they seem dumb and useless, which is not what Terminator was about. Moving on to the plot nothing improves, some of the holes and errors I have already mentioned (rounding up the humans?) but the whole story line of this film feels very empty. Originally I was under the impression this film was about some dude called John Conner who is destined to save the human race from termination by a self aware AI. However a large portion of this film seems to follow the half machine half human Marcus Wright, I don't really mind this character except for two things, the amount of screen time he takes and the use of his heart to save Conner. In the theater you could hear the groans and sighs through out of ""Really? They defaulted to the heart?"" I would have rather had Conner and Marcus survive and have Conner fully accept Marcus truly showing the difference between man and machine. Also on a side note I want to meet a doctor that can do a heart transplant on an airfield. For the shear amount of screen time that Marcus has they could have taken a little bit of that to better explain Kyle Reese's character since he is virtually unneeded for this films plot, I know they tried to tie back to the original 2 but the storyline of this film is already so far off that its just lost in the rest of the befuddlement of the plot. The direction for this film also leaves many things to be desired. Unlike in the first two you never feel like there is a chance they could fail, that the machines could win. All of the characters seem like they don't care if they really win or not. This is partly because the machines are no longer scary, but also because the dialogue and a lot of its delivery feels stiff, without emotion. I typically like Bale's work, The Machinist and Equilibrium, so I feel he was most likely he was let down in the direction, since he just felt really bland on screen. Some of the other annoying things that happened in this movie were; the number of times Conner is the only survivor by shear luck; if Conner was in my army and he lost that many soldiers and valuable resources with out accomplishing anything he would be out. This is a nit-picky but Christian Bale basically uses the Batman voice (I'm sorry Mr. Bale but that voice only works for Batman), and that last shot as the helicopter is flying away from Skynet is just too cheesy with the nuke in the background, especially compared to the nuke shot in T2.<br/><br/>Personally this film felt like the producers didn't trust their audience's intelligence to be able to process and sit through the slower more meticulous, plot intensive, Terminator movie that the first 2 were. Either that or they never had a movie and shot it anyways. Regardless of the exact cause for this films epic failure, if you thought that Terminator 3 was a punch to the face to Terminator then Terminator: Salvation is a curb stomp to the last remaining dignity that Terminator had left."
"nickjjoy","9","3","6","4 June 2009"," The movie that T3 should have been, and far better than we could have expected.
","What a pleasant surprise Terminator Salvation is. Director McG can now be defined by this movie rather than his Charlie's Angels flicks.<br/><br/>Playing somewhere between Aliens and Transformers, this robot monster mash-up is non-stop and relentless. Action sequence follows action sequence, with a great sound mix - at times you are literally gasping for breath, particularly with a chase through the desert followed by Terminator motorbikes. There's loads of visual and dialogue nods to the previous two decent movies (T3 seems to be wisely avoided, though strangely these are the same screenwriters) and it's left nicely open for further instalments.<br/><br/>Bale is very growly and Batman-ny, but it's not really his film. The real star is Sam Worthington as mysterious Marcus. Imagine an Arnie that can actually act! Star Trek's Chekhov (Anton Yelchin) is also great as the young Kyle Reese, and even a cute kid character doesn't do anything too annoying. Oh, and even the iconic Brad Fiedel five-note boom boom boom - boom boom Terminator theme is present and correct to remind you that this is the real deal.<br/><br/>The movie is dedicated to Terminator supremo Stan Winston, and I can't think of any better way to honour his great legacy of effects work. With five or six different Terminator models on display and some fab aerial stuff, this is the film that T3 should have been. True, you do spend time wondering which was the scene when Christina Bale lost his rag, but considering how extreme and tense the whole movie is, you can kind of forgive him."
"TKoote","8","3","6","3 June 2009"," Good film let down by poor directing
","Let me start with saying I'm not a big Terminator-fan. Until I was wowed by the trailer I haven't seen them and for understanding this film, I've watched them. And still wasen't a big fan.<br/><br/>Terminator Salvation isen't a Terminator-movie in the sense that it doesen't deliver the moral reasoning the first two films did and in that matter, it's more a sequel on Terminator III, not on the first two.<br/><br/>Salvation is a real treat to the eye. The stunts are perfectly performed and the CGI, although not really convincing in the air-scenes, is revolutionary good. The MotorTerminators are the best examples for that. They may be the coolest machines I've ever seen.<br/><br/>Christian Bale gives, as always, a good performance but the real star is, its said before, Sam Worthington. His debut is excellent and impressive and I really hope that the scriptwriters find a way of continuing his role in the upcoming Terminator-movies.<br/><br/>The real letdown for me was the directing. There are some fantastic scenes and stunt performed, but McG decides often to cut to a camera view in which the stunt don't deliver as they could have done. est example for that is the collapsed building in LA. They've got a great shot of that (briefly seen in the trailer) but McG decides to cut to a front-view in which you only see dust, instead of the devastation.<br/><br/>It's not all bad off course, in the very beginning of the film we see Bale crash his helicopter in a way that wasen't thinkable a couple of years ago and it's really nice to have action filmed in a relaxing way. I'll explain that. With the Bourne-trilogy for instance, the camera shocks and vibrates constantly, even when the scene only shows two people talking. With a big blockbuster like Salvation, it's really hard to get a clear view of what's happening in the scene and I must compliment McG for doing the right thing here and focus the camera.<br/><br/>Last point and definitely not least; why o why diden't Connor die? Maybe I'm nuts but when you get a metal beam through your longs and everything else you can imagine within that part of the human body, I'm pretty sure you die. I know I would have enjoyed the end if Bale's character died (nothing personal) and Worthington lives. It now seems that humans are better build that the almost indestructible Terminator's they're trying to destroy.<br/><br/>But the 8 stars don't come out of nowhere and I must admit, as pure popcorn-entertainment, Terminator Salvation delivers."
"brianx-1","9","3","6","3 June 2009"," The future is worse than could be imagined
","From the first two Terminator movies, particularly the first, we were given some indication by Reese how bad things had become in the future. They're worse, much worse. This installment is incredible in it's effects, intensity, and the tie ins to the first two (I completely discount #3, which I thought was horrible). Christian Bale is at his best, he's not Batman, he's John Connor, exhibiting an intensity as only he could. The machines were massive, scarier than one could ever imagine, and more cleverly conceived that anything I've ever seen. Forget Transformers, which I thought was for kids anyway, this is the real deal for creativeness and execution.Some surprise tie-ins to the first two installments only add to the fun. I loved it. McG, nice Directing job!"

","A excellent film, and a excellent Terminator movie. It is a excellent film for having excellent special effects, excellent fight scenes, excellent acting for the roles of the charioteers, a excellent flow, and excellent make up effects.<br/><br/>But then it is a excellent Terminator movie because of it being so true to the original films. It is true to the original films by having Kyle Reese as a charioteer, and having him show his fighting skills and using his famous line ""Come with me if you want to live."" The movie is true to the original movies by showing some of the words that Sarah Conor (played by Lind Hameltim)said at the beginner of the second film. This movie is true by showing John listen to his mothers tapes that she taped for him at the end of the first movie. The film is also true by showing some of the classic style fighting as well as car chances that were shown in the first two films.<br/><br/>So overall, it is a excellent film, as well as a excellent Terminator movie."
"JimD73","7","3","6","2 June 2009"," Satisfying enough entry into the canon
","Starts off horribly, with ham-fisted references to the older, better entries in the series (nothing ever comes across less natural than ""What day is it? WHAT YEAR!?""). Eventually, however, becomes a solid thriller worthy to stand along T3 at least, then ends in another bit of a trainwreck.<br/><br/>Overall, there's more good than bad. The more subtle references (GnR, the shotgun strap, even the necessary ""I'll be back"") work wonderfully even if the obvious ones are cringe-worthy. The action can be very good at times. New character Marcus is actually very interesting, if only they didn't spoil his arc in the trailers. Bale is a good choice as Connor, truly coming into the role in the second hour. Even Yelchin as young Kyle Reese evolves over the movie to become reminiscent of Michael Biehn. Plus it has possibly the best quasi-cameo of all time, which even with prior knowledge still knocked me off my feet.<br/><br/>Ergo, T4 gets a cautious recommendation, but it shouldn't upset fans too horribly much. It could've been done much better, but its still good popcorn fun."
"yogesh03","2","3","6","2 June 2009"," Spoiler post: Why T4 sucks!
","Reasons why T4 sucks & suggestions to make it better! <br/><br/>1. The 1st hour of the movie is just building up the plot.<br/><br/>2. The 2nd hour tries to show all the cool action that you have watched in the trailers! By then you are too bored to find it cool, especially if the trailers are in HD!<br/><br/>3. The people in the movie appear well groomed - not helpless and desolate (as they should be in a post-nuclear world)<br/><br/>4. The machines are collecting people to take them to a facility and then kill them. Why? Are you going to harvest them for making nuclear batteries? <br/><br/>5. Just use the robotic arm for picking up the people to crush them! Its more efficient instead of transporting them to a shed and THEN killing them! <br/><br/>6. In fact, why use the arm at all? Why not just carpet bomb the world and kill everyone.<br/><br/>7. Whats the use of killing ALL the people? Or even capturing them? Were the machines just trying to find something to keep themselves busy? - ""Gee, we built so many extra nuclear batteries. We'll have to build some terminators to use them now."" ""Gee, now there are extra Terminators, so lets kill some people even though they are not much of a resistance!"" groovy! (FYI, that's what Bush did in Iraq. Its not the future, its the past!) <br/><br/>8. In the beginning of the movie, John Connor looks at a nuclear blast happen and survives without even getting a pimple on his ass.<br/><br/>9. You cannot kill a terminator by shooting it with a gun! Its stupid! The bullets will just bounce off! <br/><br/>10. Once the gun is empty, you cannot throw it at the Terminator and say ""die!"" - No, that will not kill it either, unless you are trying to kill it with your stupidity! <br/><br/>11. When you see a 30 foot ""Transformer type"" robot coming at you, you should know you cannot outrun it in a pickup truck! 12. The ""predator"" in the Arnold movie was a better killing machine than the Terminators! <br/><br/>13. The bat-man like bike dispatched from the robot's leg was not meant to be ridden by a human! <br/><br/>14. When there is a nuclear blast, you cannot communicate on radio! <br/><br/>15. You cannot blow up a nuclear battery plant and possibly escape in a helicopter! You will die! <br/><br/>16. The nuclear battery plant - the source of the terminator fuel - had minimal security! Even some banks these days have lasers to guard their facility! <br/><br/>17. If the terminators are heat proof, why not have a ""heat-moat"" around the plant that will kill humans, but allow the terminators to move in and out! <br/><br/>18. After killing all the humans, what will Skynet do? Grow potatoes? Or try to create a Issac Asimov inspired SIMS world by building fornicating robots! <br/><br/>19. The human-robot removes a computer chip from his brain and survives without a hitch! Did he run a test to check if the chip - embedded in his brain - was not vital for his survival? ha! <br/><br/>20. The same human-robot throws a chair at the display screen thru which Skynet communicated with him - even I know that not going to kill Skynet! Whats the point in that? Just run and save John without trying to reason with an AI computer that has almost succeeded in destroying the world! <br/><br/>21. If you are going to argue with Skynet, at least make sure you have some logic that would throw it into an endless recursive loop that will lock it up! <br/><br/>22. He could have installed Windows Vista on the computer - That would have caused it to crash every 30 minutes! <br/><br/>23. The patches required by Vista would cause Skynet to reboot twice every week. The humans can use that time to infiltrate and capture Skynet! <br/><br/>24. Putting charcoal over an airbrushed actor does not create an authentic desolate look! Try to get some make inspiration from Mad-Max if you have borrowed a few scenes from it! <br/><br/>25. The transformer type robot in point 9 raised the count of ""Inspired movies"" to 14! <br/><br/>26. Considering all the above points, this post should be called ""your ticket money saving post!"" <br/><br/>27. A post-nuclear war world does not have a blue sky when nuclear explosions are still happening."
"flashgerbil","2","3","6","1 June 2009"," A warning to Terminator fans.
","I think anyone who has a shred of respect for the Terminator series, or actually enjoys and understands it didn't really expect anything fantastic from Terminator Salvation. By now we're used to seeing some good movie names go to waste (Alien and Predator anyone?) and I had no doubt that Terminator Salvation would finish off the task that Terminator 3 did not. Which is to completely ruin Terminator whilst cashing in as much as possible.<br/><br/>I don't want to give anything away and spoil anything for those who choose to sit through this shambles and almost remix of T1 T2 and T3. I'd rather warn you beforehand on how to prepare yourself to get the best view on this film and why actual fans of the series will be disappointed. My advice is to watch T1 and T2 before watching Salvation and to walk on into the cinema with those films fresh in your mind, just so you really can see how much the series has deteriorated. I could go into great length about the lack of character development, the poor story and general awfulness that this film delivers, but it's so blatantly obvious that I won't bother. If you follow my advice and watch the first two films before watching this you will fully understand.<br/><br/>The reason I am giving this film 2 stars instead of 1 is because it actually has done one good thing for me personally, and perhaps it will for others too. I know we can't expect Salvation to be as good as the original Terminator or Terminator 2 (because that would require story and plot development), but I found it literally that bad, I completely forgave everything I hated in Terminator 3 Rise of the Machines. In comparison, Rise of the Machines sort of ends up looking, dare I say it? Good.<br/><br/>I guess all I can really say in conclusion is that this film so awfully bad that it manages to make a ""not so bad"" film look really, quite good."
"aquaanton-1","1","3","6","31 May 2009"," Robots wearing rags and bandannas?!?!?!? u gotta b kidding me....
","I don't know where to start. I waited 18 years for this movie and had high expectations for a movie with a spectacular story line only to be messed up! All right, this is my take on the movie so let's just keep it simple. One time line no multiple story line. Let's just keep it simple like how the original writers had in mind before everything got blown out of proportion with all those multiple time lines.<br/><br/>So first off, T1 and T2 had an overall conclusion...they both saved the future by saving the life of John Connor. RIght? right. Thus, the future is saved. Therefore, the new trilogy (4 5 and 6) should only be about what the prequel of events leading to 1 2 and 3, similar to star wars 1 2 3 4 5 6 etc, even though the terminators are numbered differently. Thats my take.<br/><br/>With that said, everyone asks the same question ""how does sky-net know about kyle Reese? he was sent back in part 1 to protect Sarah Connor without sky-net knowing? In the original storyline, the terminator is sent back to assassinate Sarah in 1984 (t1) as a last resort for victory against John Connor and the humans. But they don't know who Kyle Reese is. All you people who say ""sky-net knows about kyle Reese b/c John Connor is searching for him"", well how? If that is so, the storyline in T4 never explained it. This is a movie with a complicated storyline yet much of the plot is never explained leaving many loopholes and mass confusion for the audience.<br/><br/>Whether you are a die hard terminator fan or not, here are a few reasons why the movie had horrible complications. First, the character development was basically non-existent to the film. Not once did I ever believe Marcus WRight was a bad guy from the start. He always talked about second chances second chances blah blah but for what!? OK he killed 2 police officers but i never felt any emotion for him except that he was the protagonist from the beginning. And from T3, not once did I see a reason to believe John COnnor was the prophet. There was also no storyline showing how the robots took over the world, or how John became the prophet that he is, etc.<br/><br/>And i remember from T1, kyle says in the future, people live in tunnels and they needed dogs to sniff out terminators etc. Well, if the world was ending, what would you, as a government, do? First, you would draft an army, anyone everyone willing to fight. In T4, they did not gather an army Instead they had groups of rebels in every other city here and there. Smart? No. Look at the Vietnam War where we drafted men for a war. In third world countries, they gather kids and anyone they can to fight. Not ONCE IN T4 did I see an organized group of soldiers fighting in a military unit against the robots. OK?! THis movie was very misleading. Instead I saw one terminator at the end which needed 100 bullets from an M4A1 to be destroyed. Really though, if you cant upgrade your weapons to kill a single robot, how are you gonna destroy a thousand robots with the technology you have? And secondly, a time machine is one of the most complicated technologies to be built. If you cant upgrade your guns to destroy a robot, how are you gonna build a time machine? So my friend tells me that they steal the time machine from sky-net but well look for that in part 5.<br/><br/>OK so I'm suppose to assume T4 showed the first mass production of cyborgs (human look-alike robots) when we was Arnold in the movie. Not once did Connor mention to his army ""hey, they are starting to build a army looking like humans!"".<br/><br/>I have so much I can say about this movie but ill write another review later when Im awake and not mad. But putting Moongood in the movie was a typical Hollywood move that all you fell for. A model for a movie which was unnecessary unless you trying to watch FIghting or something. You watch Aliens, you have a female soldier, tough and ready to fight. This is Judgement Day, end of the world. In war, there isn't no time to look pretty. You need the female soldier like in Aliens to fight not some topless scene. Imagine if they put a model in Black Hawk Down, how much of that movie would have been messed up? I will continue my rampage tomorrow but to end this, I will say one thing. Did anyone of you teenagers notice that there were gang banging robots in the movie? I mean...THE ROBOTS WORE BANDANNAS!!! Is that not ridiculous?!<br/><br/>And if Marcus Wright is a one of a kind soldier, why would you give up his heart over the hundreds of other soldiers?/ Use COmmons heart! He was useless! Marcus could get you in SKynet like nothing. To be technical, the hearts would probably have to be compatible in the first place. <br/><br/>McG Holla at me! I am an excellent writer and I will write a better movie for you I promise. Myspace.com/Anteezie"

"PWNYCNY","8","3","6","30 May 2009"," Good, solid sci-fi movie.
","This movie is definitely one of the better of the sci-fi genre. A taut story, solid acting and good continuity makes this movie watchable. Christian Bale gives a credible performance as John Connors but the real star is Sam Worthington as the android with an identity crisis. The movie is based on a not original but still intriguing premise involving the relationship of man and machine and which of the two is superior. This theme may seem far-fetched but it's a science fiction movie and therefore should be judged as such. Although not a classic in the tradition of Frankenstein or other landmark movies, it is nonetheless an interesting and engaging movie that presents a new take on the man vs. machine theme and does this with skill."
"Reel_starz","6","3","6","30 May 2009"," Terminator Salvation was entertaining but fails to carry on the story behind the action
","It's been twenty-five years since Arnold Schwarzenegger first donned a leather jacket and spoke the iconic words ""I'll be back."" And he certainly was. A lot can happen in twenty-five years. Sequels to the groundbreaking The Terminator sprang up, some good (T2) and some disappointing (T3), and then came the TV show. Somewhere in between Terminator 2: Judgment Day and Terminator 3: The Rise of the Machines is Terminator Salvation. While it transcends the latter by miles, the fourth installment in the Terminator franchise does not come near to touching the original or, subsequently, T2, which I think has been the best Terminator film of, well, probably ever.<br/><br/>Terminator Salvation depicts the war of the machines and the struggle of the human survivors of Judgment Day. Roughly three interconnected story lines spring up over the course of the movie: John Connor (Christian Bale) as he helps the resistance against SkyNet; Marcus Wright (Sam Worthington), a convicted criminal who was executed in 2003 only to wake up in post-Judgment Day 2018; and Kyle Reese (Anton Yelchin), who is currently a teenager but, of course, later becomes father to John Connor. Though one would think that John Connor would dominate the film as the possible savior of humanity, the most compelling of the three stories is, in fact, that of Marcus Wright. While he does not upstage Christian Bale as many critics say, Sam Worthington provides the emotional heart of the film, however small that heart might be, and displays all the signs of a future star. His performance here is a solid basis for the endless hype and praise he has received from James Cameron, who so-called ""discovered"" Worthington and will direct him in the upcoming and much-anticipated Avatar. The rest of the cast is solid. No one particularly stands out but they all are satisfactory in their roles.<br/><br/>When people heard that McG, whose most renowned work thus far is the Charlie's Angels films, the general reaction was negative. I was inclined to give McG a chance, even though it was difficult to imagine anyone besides James Cameron successfully directing a Terminator movie, particularly after the third one (the first one not directed by Cameron) failed miserably. In the end, while T4 was quite a bit better than T3, I have to admit that perhaps my doubts were correct. The editing was mediocre, especially when compared to the other special effects that occupied the film. Also, while there was definitely enough substance to support a full-length movie, the story was made secondary to the action. The film-makers began to develop some of the characters, yet by the end, the majority of them ended up being rather flat. None of them were given clear backstories (except for, of course, John Connor, who was in two of the previous films) or definite motivations. Marcus was the most intriguing and I was hoping that they would provide more information on his background, about his life prior to being sent to jail, but I was disappointed. Fortunately, though the tone of the movie is decidedly grim, the occasional references to iconic aspects of previous films - T3 not included - might elicit smiles from fans of the original and its sequel.<br/><br/>Predictably, though, the most impressive aspect of the film is the ear-busting but dazzling action and visual effects. I say ""visual"" because, while there is a lot of CGI and computer wizardry involved, many of the most eye-popping explosions were actual explosions; for one particularly spectacular blow-up scene, McG and the crew detonated a real gas station. The trailer for Terminator Salvation promises a blood-pumping, action-filled summer blockbuster, nothing more, nothing less, and the movie delivers, in that aspect at any rate. The gritty, dark atmosphere and cinematography made the landscape truly feel as though Earth has endured an apocalyptic disaster, heightening the sense of gravity and immersing the audience in this bleak world.<br/><br/>In the end, that's all it comes down to. For those expecting an original, dramatic story with a well-developed plot and characters, perhaps this is not the best place to look. However, anyone hoping for an entertaining, visually appealing spectacle, then Terminator Salvation is just the thing for you."

","Terminator Salvation is a movie with a lot of potential. The story is sufficiently solid, the cast is good, and the special effects are mostly impressive, especially in scenes that mix modern day technology with Skynet technology.<br/><br/>However, there are parts of the movie that fail to live up to their full potential. Character development is lacking in places and various scenes are lacking sufficient dramatic effect. By dramatic effect, I'm talking about the kind of tension and feeling you get from, as an example, the scene in the preview where Conner unhooks the chain from around the other guys head. If you have seen this scene in the preview, or in the movie itself, this is what I am talking about. You could feel the tension, and it seemed almost real. Unfortunately, this is missing from many other scenes in the movie, and this shortfall is what keeps the movie from being truly exceptional.<br/><br/>Despite it's shortfalls, if you are a fan of the Terminator series, or just a fan of action and/or sci-fi in general, you will probably find this movie to be reasonably entertaining and worth watching at least once."

","Much like the recent debacle that was Wolverine, Terminator Salvation is best enjoyed by having absolutely no prior knowledge to the mythos. But let's face it, these characters are ingrained in pop culture. So unless you've been under a rock or on a desert island for the last 25 years, you should have had some exposure to them and that's where TS totally fails.<br/><br/>This movie probably looked good on paper. Robots like that movie that made money a few summers ago, check. Established franchise, check. Over rated hack director, check. Obligatory references to prior movies, check. Popular leading man, check.<br/><br/>Green light this project now, let's not worry about trivialities like say a script. We'll just blow up lots a things. Wait, here's the sure fire guarantee it'll be a box office smash. We'll throw Arnold in one scene for no reason at all, except for the fact that he was a Terminator in 3 movies. We'll even resurrect a Guns & Roses song that was in a movie and was popular like 20 twenty years ago. This way the fans will see that we know about the Terminator Franchise and respect it. To push it over the top we'll throw in a couple of catch phrases that everyone knows, that'll prove we know what we're doing.<br/><br/>I didn't think the Terminator Franchise could have gotten worse after T3, but this movie totally misses the very soul of these characters. And it's had three prior movies to draw on for source material. It ignores a little thing called logic because motivations and driving forces of characters are easily established in a short scene in between blowing things up. People won't notice, they'll be too wowed by the explosions.<br/><br/>McG, go take some lessons from JJ Abrams about how to respect a franchise and the fans.

"polygnotus","4","3","6","25 May 2009"," Movie? What movie?
","The reason the original Terminator was such an enduring success is because it had intrigue. Time travel is always intriguing and T1 had a new, albeit implausible take on it. And the fish out of water element of putting a typical suburban housewife in the middle of a struggle for the future of humanity was intriguing too.<br/><br/>The fun of all this intrigue was that when the scary machine man from the future chased the kid and his mom all over LA, we were engaged. We cared. And because we cared, when the abundance of action did occur, it had a sense of purpose we could latch on to, a reason to take the ride.<br/><br/>The problem with this movie, as with most of the post-Bruckheimer action films, is it has no intrigue, no character, no heart, and no sense of purpose. How one could produce a film about an apocalyptic future Earth devoid of intrigue is the most intriguing thing to me.<br/><br/>So, like so many others in the genre, I've already forgotten about this film only minutes of having left the theater.<br/><br/>What did I just see again? Speed, explosions, effects, and the attempted piggybacking on the intrigue created by James Cameron and a lost, forgotten Hollywood that once understood the importance of telling a story. What I saw was just another forgettable movie where plot came a distant second to action and effects. <br/><br/>It is, of course, amazing what can be done nowadays. And T4 is a visual masterpiece of CGI and effects. But what a waste. Because without heart, intrigue, and purpose, there's really not much of a purpose in seeing this film. Demolition derbies are more fun."

","I knew it was gonna' suck going into it, but after chugging two 300ml bottles of sake and about 6 shots of ginseng vodka with this crazy Korean dude I met earlier in the evening, I had convinced myself to be guardedly optimistic. I knew it wasn't gonna' be as great as the first two, but maybe it would be better than the third (hopefully).<br/><br/>And you know what. If that's all you're expecting going into it, it's a good movie. Decent at least. Entertaining for sure. Definitely cheesy. At least Michael Ironside is in it. Too bad there's a mute black kid doing the Webster thing.<br/><br/>It opened decent enough. It really seemed to have a bit of momentum like it was going to be a futuristic war movie with its own spin. Separate from the rest of the cannon and inventive enough to stand on its own two legs. But then it just got lazy. Clichéd. Jeeze, the ending was shots literally ripped from the first two films so excessively you could hardly call it an homage. Especially considering the continuity blunders.<br/><br/>Since it was written by the two douchebags who had done the third one I guess I'll give them credit for not being as sucky, but that's about it. They really had a chance to do a movie that captured the despair and horror of the future Cameron briefly showed us in the first two films, but decided to totally make it a Transformers movie instead.<br/><br/>I'm sure some of the fault lays with McG (what a lame name). I guess he thought he was making a new Batman film for Bale, with all the hopping around and sitting menacingly on top of tall things he has him doing. Of course Danny Elfman scrapped the amazing soundtrack of the first two and gave us a Batman-themed score to match the cinematography. And all the sound effects for the machines seemed like they were picked up cheap at the Matrix trilogy swap-o-rama.<br/><br/>This is easily a rental. But if you want to see some cyborg love story crap on the big screen this summer, wait till it's at the discount theatre so you don't feel ripped off like I do."

","An improvement over Terminator 3: Rise Of The Machines, but it could have been much better. It has all of the elements that could have made it a great Terminator movie, story-wise, but the filmmakers just settled on making a good action movie. Which it is, it's a great action movie with memorable moments. I loved some of the nods to the previous movies. Schwarzenegger's T-800 makes a cameo and it looks amazing, but the ""I'll be back"" line and the crappy Guns N' Roses song from T2 are really unnecessary. I still don't understand why they gave away Marcus'revelation in the trailers; it took away the only surprise in the movie. It's unfortunate that the original ending was leaked on the internet and they had to change it. I believe the original would have made a much interesting ending. Also, I will never forgive director McG for cutting Moon Bloodgood's topless scene from the movie just to get a PG-13 rating. She is so hot! He better put it back when the movie comes out on Blu-Ray."
"JoeKarlosi","6","3","6","24 May 2009"," Terminator Salvation (2009) **1/2
","I approached this fourth entry in the Terminator series with many reservations, knowing it was going to be nothing more than a wild, overblown, CGI-fest. But then I figured while I waited to buy my ticket: ""well, isn't that what this particular chapter ought to be?"", and it worked out okay with me. After all, if you're a fan of the other Terminator films like I am, you already know this day has been long coming where the machines will destroy mankind and the remaining humans who make up ""The Resistance"" are going to try to fight them and remain alive, to protect what's left of the human race. So what other way is there to show so much gross chaos and devastation? Much as I don't support overused CGI on principal, it seems that this type of movie would not have been as possible 25 years ago. Luckily, this is not ""all"" special effects. I was clued in on some of the plot details beforehand by foolishly reading a newspaper review (which also spoiled a surprise late in the show which I won't get into here), but as slight as the story is, at least there is one ... with John Connor (now appropriately played by the heroic Christian Bale) trying to locate the teenage Kyle Reese who, as we already know from the original TERMINATOR, will be Connor's own father. Thrown in for good measure is a second hero with a past history that's kind of interesting. Not a good movie, nowhere hear as great as the first two, and probably a notch below Number Three. I liked the casting of Christian Bale in this, given his popularity with the new Batman movies and also because he is believable in the part of a strong leader. But as an added bonus, Bale is much more acceptable as the grownup version of Edward Furlong (from T2) compared to the badly miscast Nick Stahl (T3). **1/2 out of ****"
"tawdry_hepburn","3","3","6","24 May 2009"," Actually dude, maybe it's better if you don't come back.
","When it came out back in 1984 ""The Terminator"" was a wild ride full of action, adventure, and a killer science fiction hook. It told the story a young woman stuck in the unenviable position of having to outrun Arnold Schwarzenegger's robot from the future. It was so good that few people noticed that the sequel, subtitled ""Judgment Day"" was ostensibly the exact same movie with the son replacing his mother. By part three people were beginning to catch on, so, for the fourth entry the producers moved the action out of modern day Los Angeles and into the post apocalyptic world that was only scene for brief seconds in the earlier films.<br/><br/>While the first three entries had one story between them ""Terminator Salvation"" can't even boast that much. It's sort of about John Conner trying to save his time warped father's life. It's sort of about a multiple murderer cum cyborg trying to find his humanity. It's sort of wants to be about the human nature and the battle between free will and predestination. But really, it's just about the cool looking robots, and the big explosions.<br/><br/>And on one level, I'm all for that. I mean, the terminator is a friggin cool monster. I could watch like a dozen post-apocalyptic war movies about that thing. Or, at least I thought I could until I actually saw a post-apocalyptic war movie about these things.<br/><br/>I really, really, really wanted to like this movie. The concept seemed so fertile, the actors seemed like such interesting choices. I even sort of liked McG's ""Charlie's Angels"" flicks. And the trailers were amongst the best I have ever seen. But there is just no meat to this movie. It's boring and confusing as a stand-alone narrative, and utterly useless as an expansion of the Terminator mythology.<br/><br/>Christian Bale's John Conner is a totally blank slate. He's so visibly bored that his performance almost seems like it is taken out of a zombie film. I can't really blame him for taking a paycheck movie after years of physically draining roles like his terrifying turn in ""The Machinist"", I just wish he were slummed in a more interesting picture. Here he has no arc, no personal investment, and no real participation in the plot. He is totally passive, which is unacceptable for an action hero.<br/><br/>Come to think of it, no one has an arc in this movie. Anton Yelchin comes close as Kyle Reese, but he has to battle for screen time with Helen Bonham Carter, Sam Worthington, and Bryce Dallas Howard, who are all saddled with incredibly boring characters. At a point it became hard to tell the humans from the robots. The movie does pick up a bit when rap/tor Common is on screen. Even though he is seemingly reprising his role as ""Black weapons expert who stands around being black and not talking"" from ""Wanted"" he just oozes charisma.<br/><br/>Normally I wouldn't be so harsh on a movie that exists for the sake of spectacle, but here, I couldn't help but examine the logic flaws, character shortcomings, gaping plot holes, and persistent use of deus ex machina because even the spectacle sucked.<br/><br/>McG, aided by cinematographer Michael Fitzgerald and Director of Photography Shane Hurlbut (the latter of whom was the subject of Bale's infamous profanity laced tirade during shooting) can't seem to figure out how to shoot an action scene. I'm not even talking about the trend of super fast cuts between whirling hand-held cameras that has become so popular in recent years, I'm talking shots that are simply missing. On several occasions I found myself disoriented because the characters seemed to magic their way around a location, jumping from one place to another without any connection between shots.<br/><br/>And what's more, the movie is simply ugly to look at. The desaturated color palette was probably meant to make the movie look gritty, but instead it leaves the images looking bland. Every location looks the same. Not even the burnt out husk of Los Angeles gets a rise.<br/><br/>But the real problems begin with the script. There is just no reason for this movie to exist. it has all the impact of an episode of Power Rangers. Nothing is at stake, and at the end of the day, nothing is gained or lost.<br/><br/>At one point the movie ended with John Conner's death and replacement by a cyborg. This might have made for a cool movie (it was called Robocop), but for whatever reason the producers got cold feet and went back for reshoots, changing the ending into a weaksauce variant on this concept, which is all well and good, except for the fact that no one ever went back and fixed the first two acts so that they would match the new ending. So, as with the recent, and infinitely more entertaining, ""Star Trek"" we are left with a movie that seems at war with itself, dead set on not paying off a single set up.<br/><br/>Terminator Salvation shouldn't be a movie. It's barely passable as internet fan-fiction. Stay home and study for finals, you'll have more fun that way."

Honestly i wish Salvation was the 3rd installment but, it is to painful to talk about what could have or what should have been...The director McG pulled it all together and when you hear his name don't think ""Charlie's Angels"" or ""the O.C."" try to think ""Supernatural"" and ""Chuck"" or maybe even Offspring, Korn or Sublime music videos. Honestly and in all fairness for a TV series ""Sara Connor Chronicles"" actually helped to hype me up for this movie,that and G4, Im not sure if it was just Summer Glau, Lena Headey and Stephanie Jacobsen that got me going and it could have even just been that huge budget they had but, definitely not to shabby for TV... I kind of expected a resistance to ""T4"" at first by many but, when i saw it the theater was basically empty, which made it nice and comfy for us true believers. I still haven't completely forgiven them for ""Rise of the Machines"" and i probably never will but, i cant forgive Scott Bakula or Roddenberry's legacy for the series ""Enterprise"" but, i did enjoy the new movie.

Don't get me wrong its a entertaining movie, maybe one of the most entertaining for the summer (so far).

"mrohlee","3","3","6","23 May 2009"," CGI done by a master, plot & script by 3rd grader
","This movie makes you appreciate how great James Cameron is. In the first movie Kyle Reese says he is coming from the 2024 and the Arnold model terminator was new. This movie is set in 2013 and Kyle Reese is a teenager. The basic frame work is there and the CGIs were excellent particularly the motorcycle robots. Part of this sequence is in the trailer. Another nice point was using Michael Ironside as a leader of some kind of quasi official resistance movement.<br/><br/>Now how the heck did they mess this up? It starts in the year 2003 where a guy is about to be executed via lethal injection. A woman doctor begs him to donate his body to science. You think oh she will be a part of the plot but no, she is not seen as a living person again. Now the guy is killed via lethal injection. He is dead but somehow the doctor must have jumped in and cut out his brain and heart and in spite of the lethal injection apparently neither organ is damaged. Flash to 2013 and the guy pops up with a functional human brain and heart in what turns out to be a terminator-lite body.<br/><br/>So here are the first couple of problems. In the first movie Reese said the early terminators had rubber skin and were easy to spot but this body appears perfect not rubbery at all. Ignoring that you ask why did they use the guys heart? The brain you can understand but why would they bother with the heart when there are no lungs? Well it's a plot device.<br/><br/>The robot with a human brain guy hooks up with teen age Kyle Reese is living in burned out LA with what seems to be an eight year old girl. Between the two of them they work out some pretty elaborate booby traps. Why are they there? You would think Reese would be the type of person to try to save an eight year old rather than turn her into a front line fighter but what the heck.<br/><br/>He has a series of adventures and winds up with John Conner trusting him to help rescue teen age Kyle Reese who is a captive of the terminators. Another captive is Jane Alexander who is introduced, has a couple of lines and you think, if they put in an actress of her status they would use her later in the movie. But no it's just a delightful cameo for no apparent reason.<br/><br/>The camp that the machines have doesn't sound anything like the one Reese described in Terminator 1 but again you can ignore that. Now we find out that the robot with a human brain was programmed by the machines to trick John Conner to come in. Okay so they built the robot and got a feed from what his robot eyes saw. Why didn't they just explode his power source when Conner was inches from him instead of this elaborate ploy? Now in the high light of the movie a Arnold model terminator gets loose and attacks Conner. That is fantastic CGI. Now Arnold kills the robot with the human brain & heart with a heart punch. Conner brings him back and together they defeat the terminator and get loose after Conner is impaled.<br/><br/>At this point the movie was okay but here in the last 5 minutes they completely lost me. Conner is in the desert under a canopy and his wife/doctor says his heart is damaged. Now we understand why the robot with the human brain was given a heart!! He says he will be an organ donor! His wife doctor immediately agrees and apparently they had a team of surgeons and a heart/lung machine standing by in the desert there. The blood /tissue types match and wham bam thank you mam the heart transplant is successful.<br/><br/>What kind of doctor would ripe a heart out of a living person in order for a transplant? The only time I saw this before was in ""Monty Python's Meaning of Life"". That time it was funny this time it was like a 3rd grader wrote it. What kind of leader would agree to take a living heart from one of his followers?? It was just too stupid for me.<br/><br/>Why was the human brain the machines choose the one from the lethal injection guy that was in a pickle jar or someplace for 10 years when they had hundreds/thousands of captives to choose from? Did you see ""Frankenstein""? Or ""Young Frankenstein""? Maybe the robot sent out to get a human brain accidentally dropped the good one and picked the lethal injection one. Why have the human brain at all when they could make the outside of him perfect? The outside was really all that mattered.<br/><br/>So if you are interested in CGI effects you might enjoy it. I did not."

","I heard there was a 'revealing' scene with Moon Bloodgood that got cut to ensure a PG13 rating. Perhaps they should have left that in. The Terminator I remember from my teen years was pure R-rated fun. This movie doesn't touch the first Terminator. I learned a new word from a fellow viewer during the trailers...'Technophobia.' This seems to be a growing (or at least persevering) trend in movie-making. Lots of scary robots of all shapes and sizes trying to kill people. It seems like I've seen this plot unfold over and over again. Quest/Overcoming the Monster Plot leads to climax leads to denouement. Fun, but I think the movie could have used less action and more story. Maybe it's my age talking. Fellow viewers clearly enjoyed it, and some even (and this is weird) applauded. I didn't think it was anything special, but it was nevertheless, fun mindless entertainment."
"thefilmguy7","7","3","6","23 May 2009"," Terminator is back and almost as good
","One of the better Hollywood movies to come out recently but that's not saying much. I always thought it would be cool if they made a Terminator movie that focused on the future war. I actually wrote a version with crayons in grade school. It just seemed like it was finally time to to get on with it. I had some doubts when I first heard about this movie in large part to McG being the director. Then I saw that kick ass trailer and, like most people who saw it, I was impressed. I had really big expectations. After seeing it I can say that it was below my original expectations but it's also better then the reviews make it sound. Yes it's a little too action driven and the narrative is a little chaotic. Some of the characterizations could be better. Especially in John Connor's case. But the movie was still pretty damn entertaining. It definitely had a lot of little treats for the people who grew up on the original. Things that were discussed and hinted at in the previous films have pay offs in this film. There are even a few surprise cameos that I won't give away. So the fan boy in me was definitely satisfied in certain parts. The Marcus Wright character was probably the best thing about the new movie which is both good and bad. While it's good that his character adds to the movie I felt that he outshined John Connor a little too much. They took a great deal of effort to set up and establish Marcus and his character arc but John was overlooked to some degree. In the end this new series is supposed to be more about Connor's rise and his battle with the machines and I felt that his arc got a little lost in Marcus's shadow. It didn't help that Christian Bale's screen time was very limited for the first half of the movie. For the most part, it's Marcus's movie at least in the first half. Some times I almost forgot that Christian Bale was even in the movie. We never really get to know this new John Connor either. Every time we see him he is just going on and on about strategy and skynet. There wasn't enough human moments with him. If they had more scenes with John and his wife, maybe discussing her pregnancy, it would have made him more relatable. It's odd that we can see that she is pregnant but not one time in the movie do they talk about it or what it will mean to have a baby in this world. I'm sure that they shot scenes like that but for some reason the got edited out. I think this was a big mistake. It's ironic that Marcus, a machine, is more dimensional then the human lead. Passed the halfway point though the film picks up and gets a little better handling John Connor's character. He actually gets some stuff to do. I think Bale for the most part was effective in the role. Any blame for his portrayal seeming flat I think falls on the screenwriters and director. They just didn't give Bale a lot to work with in the first hour. Besides Sam Worthington as Marcus, the other big surprise to come from the cast is Anton Yelchin as Kyle Reese. I didn't think the guy could pull it off when I first saw him but by the end of the movie I was sold. He definitely is believable as a young Michael Biehn. I was impressed with that casting choice. I guess the only other beef I really had was with the ending. It seemed a little rushed and the solution a little too obvious. They spent so much of the film setting up the Marcus character and where they leave him off just felt a little anti climatic. I think they should definitely find a way of bringing that character back for the sequels. I felt they could have done better at setting the ending up for where a sequel could pick off from. Over all though the film was good. I mean it wasn't the best but it certainly wasn't the worst. It's not as good as the first two Terminators but I can definitely assure everyone that it's better then the 3rd one. I would recommend it. I'm hopeful for where this series could go from here."

","So I managed to acquire half a dozen advance screening tickets for the movie for tonight and with as little spoilers as possible...<br/><br/>It was awesome.<br/><br/>So far, what I'm reading from critics is concerning the lack of humor and downbeat characters in the film. Which in short, is a joke in itself. Do they expect people to be cracking witty remarks in these dark post-apocalyptic times? It's grim, it's gray and everyone is (barely) living in fear. Don't pay attention to RT at the moment, they are clueless. These are hardened people, comparatively speaking, how many homeless people do you see begging that are laughing their butt's off? Exactly, and if they are, then they haven't been homeless long enough! For fans of the Terminator mythology and have actually payed attention to the little things, you will definitely be able to find some joy the bleak background. Without spoiling too much, it brings back certain artifacts from the first film especially (the picture, the tapes, the building of Kyle Reese - the shot gun) and also something which I'm not sure everyone noticed but an important origin of a distinguishable physical characteristic shown in the past films with John Connor.<br/><br/>For people who aren't really familiar with the previous installments (like my co-worker ""wait, were there movies before this one?"" I almost lost it on her!), they may be a little confused but regardless of being unaware of these tie ins, they will be thoroughly entertained. This is a fantastic blockbuster film on it's own, but giving it a Terminator template made it even better. Some of the special effects/cgi were simply breathtaking and there were plenty of ""holy!"" moments, never thought such a bleak future could look so beautiful at times.<br/><br/>Now, I could understand why people would be disappointed for the sheer fact that ""it was no T2"" but honestly, how the heck are you going to top that? Judgment Day was groundbreaking and a brilliant mind blowing action movie. No matter who they hired, it would never hold a candle to it. BUT, McG did a great great job. For an MTV director to respect Terminators history and mythology and give us something as exciting, pulsating, enjoyable from beginning to end with a PG-13 rating it quite remarkable. I'm not saying he's amazing or anything of the sort, but he may have made people rethink their prejudgment when they snarfed and made snide comments about his name.<br/><br/>Performances wise, they were pretty good all around. Sam Worthington steals the show, Bale did his part and was a bit monotone but I don't expect much more from someone who is leading the resistance and has endured what he has. The supporting cast did their part as well and it felt pretty even. No major qualms really.<br/><br/>When the credits were about to roll and the Terminator theme song started to play, I let out a great sigh of relief and left the theater with a smile on my face. The Terminator franchise/mythology holds close to lots of us, we grew up on it (specifically T2) and the fear of having it crushed (ala T3) would be heartbreaking, but fear not."

No. It does, however, run circles around the horribly abysmal Terminator 3.<br/><br/>By now everyone knows the plot outline, so I won't waste time going over it. I will say though, that I am not sure where some critics are seeing this movie. I read one review that stated that there was hardly any action in the film. That's just plain wrong. From the opening of the movie to the final explosion, there is an action beat just about every 10 to 15 minutes.<br/><br/>There are points to the plot that are not revealed in the trailer, and for good reason. I thought the bit of plot introduced at the end of the movie was very cleverly done and tied things together nicely.<br/><br/>One of the high points in the film is actually the visual effects. The CGI looks great, as do the real life prosthetics and machines. From the best that I could tell, all of the T-600 models were actually built. The locales and the backdrops also do a lot to give off a convincing vibe that you are post apocalyptic, although it does not ring out the same tone as the previous Terminator movies. Take Terminator 2 for instance. In the first two minutes you are witnessing an all out war between the machines and the humans. Things are blowing up, people are getting shot, and you immediately get the feeling that the humans are fighting for survival.<br/><br/>This leads me to one of my two main gripes about the film. First, you really don't feel at any time that the resistance is in any danger. Yeah, they fight, but it doesn't really feel bleak, like the human race is on the edge of extinction. Maybe that was by design, due to the resistance having hope based on some intel they found, but it just didn't sit well with me. And the second thing that bothered me was the acting overall. Now again, maybe it was by design, but everyone in the resistance seemed pretty at ease after seeing the world go up in flames and being wiped out by machines. I will say though that the actor that plays Reese, Anton Yelchin, did an amazing job in replicating Michael Biehn's portrayal of Kyle Reese in the first film. From the way he pronounces things to his mannerisms, he is pretty spot on.<br/><br/>With all of that being said, I had high hopes for the film and it did not disappoint. Sure, I would of liked it to be Rated R, but I don't feel that it broke the film. It went a long way in redeeming the series after the huge let down with the third film. There is supposedly going to be two more films to to complete a second trilogy. If they do go through with it, hopefully we will get to see the post apocalyptic world that we came to know in the first two films."
"Raage","9","3","6","20 May 2009"," I got what I wanted
","This movie was definitely not perfect. The story was incredibly weak, flat out. I expected it to be a little deeper, considering most people rolled their eyes at terminator number 3, and i didn't expect it to get any more plain. It's pretty damn cut and dry here, though. <br/><br/>My favorite aspect of the movie was the photography/sound. This is why it's a nine for me, as visuals and atmosphere are what I like to focus on. When I saw the trailer, I knew it had the potential to create this weird, post-apocalyptic war zone. It definitely succeeded. One shot in particular appears to go on for about five minutes, following Bale through some rough times. Obviously it would have been impossible to film it in one take, but I thought it came together really well. <br/><br/>The CGI blended very nicely as well. The past few blockbuster movies have really changed my mind about CGI, and this one is no exception. The giant robots were intense, and Marcus with half his face shot off and a hole in his head looked pretty sweet. <br/><br/>I also liked the acting. I think many will disagree, but I really liked the cast. Yelchin I never really liked, but aside from some cheesy dialog I was into him as Kyle Reese. Bale was obviously satisfying, but Sam Worthington really surprised me. I didn't think I would like him, but I really got into his character, one of the stronger parts of the storyline I thought. Moon was questionable, but I also did not have a single problem with her acting. Common was a mistake. Who the hell hires this guy? Really poor choice there. <br/><br/>What did it for me was the atmosphere. The photographer takes obvious advantage of the scenery, but it works perfectly and really put me in the world of terminator. I would definitely recommend it for this reason. Don't go looking for a deep story, just go to be put in a completely new and different world for a couple of hours."
"StrayLiteFocus","4","7","20","6 June 2009"," Largely Disappointing
","When a film opens with a huge text narrative you know the filmmaker is going to have a hard time showing the rest of the story.<br/><br/>There were some interesting ideas, here, but the film just did not elicit any emotional involvement from me... it did not give me a reason to care for any characters except the little girl who did not speak. This film does not stand on its own like the first two and does not add anything of merit to the Terminator series, IMHO.<br/><br/>I had really hoped this film would salvage the Terminator franchise from the pits of T3... didn't happen. The Batman franchise has been reinvigorated with a gritty new Batman. 007 has been reborn tougher and cooler. I expected this film to follow the trend and reinvigorate the Terminator franchise.<br/><br/>John Connor *is* grittier in this film, but there isn't enough of a cool factor and very little to provide an emotional tie to this grittier John Connor."

","In 2003, in the Longview State Correctional Facility, the criminal Marcus Wright (Sam Worthington) that is in the death row is convinced by the cancerous Dr. Serena Kogan (Helena Bonham Carter) to donate his body to her research and he accepts. In 2018, after an unsuccessful attack to a Skynet facility, only John Connor (Christian Bale) survives, but he discovers that Skynet is developing the powerful new model T-800. Out of the blue, Marcus appears naked and with amnesia in the location. Marcus befriends the teenager Kyle Reese (Anton Yelchin) and the girl Star (Jadagrace Berry) that help him to survive to lethal machines and they travel together in a Jeep. Meanwhile the resistance discovers a signal that might turn-off the machines and John offers to test it. When Kyle is captured by a machine and brought to the Skynet headquarter, Marcus decides to help the youngster and heads to Skynet; on the way, he saves Blair Williams (Moon Bloodgood) that suggests him to meet John Connor first. But Marcus steps on a mine and is submitted to a surgery, when a secret about his origins is disclosed. <br/><br/>""Terminator Salvation"" is another great movie of this franchise. The story is full of action, and supported by a good story, great acting and excellent special effects.

","Where do I start. I would just like to comment on the movie's association with the saga. The movie absolutely did not FEEL like a Terminator movie. No suspense, horror etc, u know wt i mean. Too much of everything (even other stories like Transformers, Batman). I didn't know (for most of the movie) wt the mission in the movie was unlike the others. I didn't know who the main character was. The movie makers did not try and make this as a Terminator movie, instead they added a few scenes and line to make this movie SEEM like one in order to hurl in few extra bucks. And i could go on and on. Def not adding this to my Terminator DVD collection. Hopefully som1 remakes this in future. Total disappointment. What a waste of my time. Spoiled my mood."
"jerekra","3","15","55","21 May 2009"," Terminate This Film.
","Going into viewing Terminator Salvation, I really had high expectations and possibly too high of expectations. I could see this film being mediocre, but there was no reason for it to be as bad as it was.<br/><br/>The plot is very bad in this film. For the most part I was unclear at the beginning what was going to be going on. I thought it was just going to be John Connor leading humanity against the machines. That was happening I guess, but there were a few side stories going on that I think deterred the film off the main purpose.<br/><br/>I had no idea what was going on for the early part of this film. The reason that Kyle Reese was in the film is somewhat odd and very unclear. I do not want to keep beating a dead horse, the plot was very stupid and boring.<br/><br/>Let me discuss the acting. Christian Bale was OK as John Connor. He did not do anything special. He uttered one extremely bad line that should never be said by anyone who is not named Arnold Schwarzenneggar. If you saw the film you know what I mean.<br/><br/>The action was OK at times. The effects were well done, especially for the T 800s. But a lot of the times the action scenes were too fastly paced and it was hard to tell what was going on.<br/><br/>Also, there was not a lot of humor in this film. It was too serious. The other Terminator FIlms were not comedy flicks, but they at least had fun moments at times. This one did not have any funny parts really.<br/><br/>Towards the end of this film they show the T 800 covered in skin looking like Schwarzenneggar. THat made me remember how great he was in the other films and how great he made those films. Schwarzenneggar was far more important to this series than people realize and his absence from this film for me made me see that without Schwarrzenneggar the Terminator Franchise would not be as great.<br/><br/>So, OK action, bad plot, no Schwarzenneggar. Not recommended at all and a huge disappointment for me."
"spaceweezle","1","4","10","9 February 2019"," Nonsensical Garbage
","I couldn't stomach watching more than 15 minutes of this abomination. The direction is just pathetic.<br/><br/>Troops get ambushed by a tank-class mech and they magically kill it with sub-machine guns that traditionally wouldn't even scratch a normal T-101, meanwhile the Mech just stands there for 5 seconds not doing anything while they fire their pea-shooters. Absolute nonsense.<br/><br/>Similarly, a soldier gets ambushed by a T-101 and instead of grabbing the man and crushing him to a pulp, the crippled Terminator conveniently throws the guy a few feet away to where it can't catch him.. Stupid. T-101's aren't even modeled correctly.<br/><br/>The movie is annoying, insulting and just plain boring. A disgrace to the franchise."
"williamzim2000","10","4","10","21 May 2009"," Don't believe the bad reviews. This is an OUTSTANDING action film!!!
","I saw so many bad reviews here, but also noted the 8/10 score, so I went to see it, and I loved it!!! I expected a mediocre film, instead, I got an outstanding action flick, AWESOME special effects, earth-rocking sound effects (that make the machines shake the theater), and a tightly edited, well directed film. All of the visuals that the first film suggests, the sense of desolation, the burnt out cities, the GIANT machines, the horrifying impersonal world they create, it's all there. All of my expectations were filled.<br/><br/>John Conner finds he must rescue Kiel (his father to be) after he is captured by the machines. This leads through a long, exciting journey into the charred world where the machines are now made in automated factories, spewing out black smoke into the sky. Along with this plot is an additional complication. There is a robot we don't know if is friend or foe, and could jeopardize the entire attempt. I won't give away more, suffice it to say the movie was great, and I enjoyed every moment of it. I kept waiting for the bad parts the negative reviewers gave it, but none of them materialized. I don't know what some people expect out of a summer action film. It ain't supposed to be Shakespeare, dummies! It's a fun ride, with great sound, great visuals, scary machines, all the things you'd expect. Excellent summer entertainment, and a great ride. Go see it, ignore the critics!"
"Nirgaul","4","8","26","20 May 2009"," Rubber Soul
","I saw this with low expectations, and still found it disappointing. No matter what type of action film, there are always opportunities to discover something new and entertaining. There are a few moments where this borders on being innovative, and walks away.<br/><br/>The biggest problem with this movie is there is too much going on, and not enough time for the audience to become invested in the world. There are some great locations where we could get to know the characters...let the atmosphere sink in, but it never lasts. In fact, we're given caricatures, not characters. We see Bryce Howard's expressive eyes and her innocence, but never get to know her character's soul. Christian Bale knows how to convey intensity, but it seems like he's forgotten how to convey the sort of passion that he showed in Empire of the Sun. That kind of desperation and resilience and fear is what I'd rather see in his character than the coarse monologues about surviving and being tough, one after another.<br/><br/>For a story that tries to define what it is to be human in terms of emotional registers and taking chances, it sides with the logic of the machines. It knows how to pacify audiences, but fails to win their spirit."

","The only things I didn't like around this movie were the bad reviews. Cannot understand so many smart-ass reviewers commenting on pure fiction as if they would know exactly how the world or themselves would behave in that apocalyptic scenario. I saw this again after 6 years and still enjoyed it a lot, especially considering the poor sequels with Arnold.<br/><br/>The director just created a brilliant environment which fits perfectly with the events and this matters a lot with any SciFi movie. Really good action scenes. Bale and Worthington entered well into characters.<br/><br/>It would be smart to not take for real any reviews and just make your own opinion for those who haven't seen this yet and this is the only reason why I decided to post here. And for everyone else: STOP writing bad reviews, just let people make their own opinions since everything is subjective when it comes to movies/music etc."

","This movie was not worthy of being part of The Terminator franchise. My dad who is one of the biggest Terminator fans you will ever meet was so disappointed with this movie and as was I. Seriously, I went into this movie with quite low expectations. I was expecting at least an okay movie and hoping for at least some kind of story. But the story was just so ridiculous, I found myself laughing at this. First of all, why was John Connor so surprised that Marcus Wright was a machine and human? Why did they use lines that Arnold Schwarzenegger says in the previous films? That was just unnecessary, couldn't they come up with new catch phrases for the film? The machines were okay, but how did John Connor break into their base so quickly? Unbelievable. This movie was a complete failure, I thought Terminator 3 was bad, but after seeing this I regret ever thinking that. This 'movie' I was bored not even an hour in. Yeah, sure the special effects were good, I'll give them that. There's not much I can say about the acting either. Christian Bale may as well have been a machine, no facial expressions and his speeches were totally uninspiring. Sam Worthington was average, but he didn't do anything special. Anton Yelchin & Jadagrace did their best with what they were given. The stand out for me was seeing Helena Bonham Carter (Seriously, how did they get her to agree to this crap?) for the 5 minutes of the movie she was in. If you've seen the first two Terminator films and loved them all this movie will do is bring you disappointment."
"cherold","6","3","7","2 January 2011"," As big and soulless as a terminator
","Think about the original Terminator. Think about the clever premise, the emotional resonance, the humor, the suspense and the special effects. Now get rid of everything except the special effects and about half the suspense and you've got Terminator Salvation. This movie is a big-budget action picture that simply throws a lot of action sequences at you one after the other. This makes for a perfectly watchable action flick, but it is also easily the weakest entry in the series.<br/><br/>It also should have been the last entry. Producers have been squeezing everything out of the Terminator franchise they can for years, but the only reason to jump into the future is to show you how the premise of the previous movies and the TV series pay off. Instead, you have what will probably be the first in a series of big soulless action flicks that continue this big, uninteresting war story.<br/><br/>They would have been better off just making a movie version of the tragically short-lived TV series, but at this point I feel Terminator is just done. There is nothing left."

","Are you serious? Mc....G? I'm pretty sure no one's mother would intentionally name their child.... McG, so it leaves one to assume that this.... McG.... thinks he's being rather cool and ""arty"" and deserving of a monographicesque name. I can only think of two others with this mental affliction off hand, madonna and cher - both of which are... just.. terrible.<br/><br/>ON with the review. I wont lie to you, some parts of this i liked. I enjoy special effects - if there's a point to them. I was disappointed with the amount of screen time given to T600s because I liked the idea of these terminators being more primitive and having to be bigger and clunkier... but what is with those hydrobots? and a harvester? Is this a Transformers sequel? there are some very large plot holes in this movie which have already been covered by many other viewers, but I feel like I'll pop if I don't vent about them myself. the whole Marcus thing - a human/terminator hybrid. This is kinda taking a figurative dump on James Camerons original idea of a fully mechanical skeleton that needs flesh to be grown around it to infiltrate resistance camps (and time travel). Making a person into half a machine, and letting him/her keep her mental faculties... why? And if this was so successful, why bother with t800s at all?<br/><br/>Next of all... Christian bale? he's a worse john connor than the whiney nick stahl version. i find bale hard to watch for the simplest of reasons. his voice grates on me... He's either grunting or shouting and after watching the last batman movie i just don't feel like i can have him infecting my TV with his presence any longer.<br/><br/>On the plus side there were a couple things i did like about this movie. As i mentioned, the T600 is one, I would give the mototerminators a 3 out of 5 for coolness and the final fight with the Schwarzenator was what i would have expected from the first movie if it had been made with todays movie making technology. regardless of these 2 plus's, this movie gets a 1 out of 10 on the whole as it seemed to be more of a watered down mixture of the first 3 movies than a movie of its own.<br/><br/>And finally .....McG... are you f****ing serious?!?!?!?!?! <br/><br/>McG?!?!?!?!?!?!"

","Minor spoilers follow:<br/><br/>As a technical achievement, Terminator Salvation is a competently produced movie. The sets, props, and costumes look great, the CGI is smoothly blended, the stunts are well performed, etc.<br/><br/>However, as a chapter in the Terminator mythology, TS is a complete failure. Quite simply, it doesn't matter. By the end of the movie, virtually nothing is gained, nothing is changed. Stuff gets blown up, some minor characters die, some major characters suffer some injuries and some angst, but nothing substantial happens.<br/><br/>The movie begins with a pre-Judgement Day flashback of a prison. A death-row inmate named Marcus Wright (Sam Worthington) sells his soon-to-be corpse to Cyberdyne Industries - who most fans of the franchise already know will eventually produce the artificial intelligences that will become the terminators and Skynet.<br/><br/>Later, Wright inexplicably wakes up, completely confused and with a fragmented memory, in the post-apocalyptic world. In other words, the filmmakers may has well flash a subtitle saying, ""This guy is terminator! He doesn't know he's a terminator, but he is; there isn't the slightest doubt!"" It's so obvious, and is shown so early, that I don't think these comments meet the definition of ""spoilers.""<br/><br/>Later, after Wright's, uh, terminator-ness is confirmed, and the audience mulls over the idea a little, there may as well be another subtitle saying, ""Skynet is a supercomputer; it isn't going to just forget that it turned a human into a cyborg. What do YOU think that means?""<br/><br/>In addition, there are other flaws. Somehow, Skynet knows that Kyle Reese is a critical target, even though there is no way that could have happened. Also, the two male leads - Christian Bale as John Connor and Sam Worthington as Wright, spend a lot of time posing, preening, staring, grunting, etc., each trying to out-Eastwood one another, but otherwise are fairly unconvincing.<br/><br/>Then again, who knows? Maybe, after a decade into the apocalypse, I might spend all of my time striking my best tough-guy pose with everyone I meet. We'll cross that bridge when we come to it.<br/><br/>There are several good action scenes, including a five-story tall super robot, with its rider-less motorcycles-of-doom; but, after awhile, it becomes apparent that the plot isn't really going anywhere. Even with the much-criticized Terminator 3, plot points matter. With this movie, a viewer can take a bathroom break at almost any time, and miss nothing important.<br/><br/>All in all, Terminator Salvation is a useful distraction for a few hours, but has none of the appeal of the first two classics, and even lacks the limited ""...I didn't see that coming..."" appeal of the third."

","There's so many things that are questionable about this film and so many things that need explaining. Why should I go on to IMDb and read the FAQ to find out why certain things in this film made no sense.<br/><br/>Such as: Kyle Reese being a teenager? Why? the first film makes it out like him and John grew up together, its so stupid they even had to add an extra part of the message that John Connors mum recorded just so it looked like it made sense.<br/><br/>How do Skynet know who Kyle Resse is Why did Skynet use Kyle as bait for Connor, killing Kyle would have automatically killed John, the FAQ for this is wrong, ""the computers are systematic"", that doesn't mean they are stupid, if they know he is the farther they would kill him straight away, the same they tried to do with his mother.<br/><br/>How come John Connor was the key to the resistance's survival, by encouraging them to jump the fence, but we never see him do this? Why do they fight in the day? When previously the said they could only do so at night? Why should we care for Marcus? He kills his brother and some policemen and is on death row? Why do they not explain how John Connor and the rest of the resistance got to the point they were at today? How did they survive the nuclear bombs? Why is Arnie's Terminator already made, when this film is set before the time he was sent back where he was brand new.<br/><br/>Why do the robots guard their main base so poorly? John Connor releases all the prisoners and kyle and only one terminator is attacking them while there in a terminator creation factory.<br/><br/>If Marcus is a robot how come he moves just as a human? If they had the technology to make him this Flexable why do they make all the other robots slow and clunky.<br/><br/>How come they destroy Skynet's main base yet at the end they say Skynet is still operation all over the world. So they can milk the franchise more with more films obviously but it makes no sense, Salvation is to be saved from, yet the threat is still there its so ridiculous. I was at least expecting them to send Kyle back in time with after one of the terminators. It makes me think did McG even watch the first films? And lastly why is John Connor so 2d, when bale is on screen he is either angry, or serious, shows no emotion.<br/><br/>All in all the film doesn't have the suspense and tension of the first films, i found it very hard to care for any of the characters. None of them were going to die, Bale needs to live to for more sequels, Kyle needs to live for bale, the little girl can't die because that would just be toooooo horrible. The only one that was a bit of a surprise was Marcus, it seemed a little bit ridiculous for him to so quickly give up his life for the angry arrogant Connor.<br/><br/>The film could have been so much better but in the end we are left with some cool action scenes, generic/boring acting, characters that you cant care for and a franchise slowly being sucked to death."

All these sequels are beginning to feel like the same story: Matrix morphs into Terminator into Battlestar into HAL 9000.<br/><br/>This guy McG is a terrible terrible director, absolutely artless and obviously without an ear for dialog. The script? Full of every action movie cliché and high-school level prose. What garbage.<br/><br/>And like the cigarettes and fuel for the jet-skis in Waterworld, where did the human Resistance in T4 get all of their military gear? Where did it come from? How is it possible for Hollywood to screw up these iconic franchises? A retarded squirrel could do better.<br/><br/>Sam Worthington ... boring. New Chekov as Kyle Reese ... oh please. The little black girl who knows her way around munitions? How multicultural. The Oracle at least offered Neo a cookie, Jane Alexander only gave the little girl a carrot. And did you see the guy in the distance with the blower making smoke in the LA scene were Kyle Reese and the little girl and the Sam Worthington terminator were the *only* survivors - then who was that guy? And as with Matrix Reloaded and Revolutions, if the computers have been hacked and taken over by the supreme robot intelligence why then does so much of the human resistance rely on computers??? And speaking over open channels from submarines under water to land bases hundreds or thousands of miles away - does that not require satellites? Is that not monitored by Skynet? And if the Terminator airbots, motorcyclebots, ad infinitum use infrared to seek out the humans then why the heck are they using huge flood lights everywhere? Stupid stupid stupid.<br/><br/>The original Terminator's bleak future was lo-tech and survivalist and people were barely hanging on. In McG's Terminator future they had stylish leather outfits and Breck-girl hair (the pilot chick), they had an endless supply of ammo and weapons.<br/><br/>McG is like so many Gen-X, Gen-Y filmmakers who do re-makes of iconic earlier stories: A, they have no ideas and can't write so they mine old material. B, they don't have the slightest understanding of what made the original timeless in the first place and worthy of a remake. Charlie's Angels was essentially the Powerpuff Girls with humans, it wasn't Charlie's Angels, and now McG's Terminator Salvation has aborted and polluted the Terminator mythology and story."

","Terminator 1 is a classic, Terminator 2 is lots of fun, Terminator 3 was surprisingly really cool...but what is this?! Nothing but a waste of good money. I wonder what a real director with a real script would have accomplished with the same money...<br/><br/>Warning Spoiler!<br/><br/>No logic at all: One second Kyle Reese warns Wright not to go out at night because of infrared equipped machines, the next second they sit at a fire! Actually they like to sit a fires all the time... Then the resistance fighter don't attack Skynet, only because of Connor's bad speech, explaining nothing, and he is not even the leader of the resistance?! Come on! Love Interest: Just badly written...I don't know where to start. It kind of fits with the rest of the movie.... And what's the point of that heart thing? Please somebody explain it to me. Is it really about what defines a human being?!! Give me Bladerunner...even I Robot...or...god forgive A.I...although on second thought maybe not A.I.."

","If I could score this movie higher, I would. One previous viewer stated there was no plot and the actors were playing their parts more for the camera, than for the movie, I could not disagree more, did we see the same movie? As a fan of not only the Terminator films, but, the whole genre, to often people go to films like these expecting acting on par with Kirk Douglas, Burt Lancaster, etc. It won't happen. If you go expecting good acting, maybe not great, you will not be let down. I found the acting great. Christian Bale was superb in his role as John Connor, of course there a few corny twists here and there and one gaff, in particular comes to mind, when a pilot is shot down and rescued, they light a fire in the desert. The machines have IR, why would you give them a heat source to track on? Okay, that's my spoiler. If you want an action, a shoot-'em-up, a drama, a Sci-Fi, movie with plenty of ""OOMPH"" go see this film. I have been following Christian Bale since Empire of The Sun, and have found him to be a fantastic actor, he did not disappoint in Terminator. I am also rapidly becoming a fan of Moon Bloodgood, she did a great job her as well. All in all, I cannot say enough good about this film. Go see it."
"mangelbhj27","8","3","7","25 May 2009"," How could you not appreciate this film?!
","I'm sorry I just read one of the critiques on this page panning this movie from the acting to the CGI. This movie far exceeded my expectations. I'm not going to say it's THE summer blockbuster of 2009 but it definitely makes the list of top 5 coming out this year. T4 was able to pick up from T3 without bringing in any of the suckage that was T3. We finally get a chance to meet a few characters that have been the foundation of the Terminator series despite their limited screen time. All around I felt that a great choice was made in casting Kyle Reese and that Christian Bale perfectly embodied the John Connor we first met in T2. Definitely not the sissy that John Connor from T3 was. The incorporation of Marcus as a hybrid between machine and human helps to carry the story and answers several questions that viewers have been asking for over 2 decades. Definitely go out and see this film and form your own opinion. But I can guarantee that this movie is worth seeing and a wonderful addition to the Terminator films. In fact, if you just pretended T3 never happened and went on to see T4 the entire movie would still make perfect sense and would only bring with it his love interest from the 3rd film. Go see it and enjoy. They bring in some great lines, and really interesting moments. Possibly the only thing that doesn't make sense is that Skynet seems to have selective hearing. But who can't appreciate a little suspension of disbelief every now and again? Make sure you post what you thought. I can't imagine that everyone will hate this movie as much as some people."
"alex_pavlovic001","9","3","7","24 May 2009"," Ignore the haters... This is a great film.
","Terminator Salvation is the perfect movie to see when you want to see a whole bunch of action and excitement. It's the 4th movie in the Terminator series and it is the first in a new trilogy that goes over the war against the Machines.<br/><br/>This movie is better than expected with all these mixed reviews from these people who call themselves ""critics"". This movie has a different formula compared to the first 3 Terminators. It's a movie about a war, not about time-traveling back in time, stopping John Connor from leading the humans to victory.<br/><br/>People who hated this movie expected too much from it. Or maybe they just want the producers to fail. People seem to bash its horrid acting and plot, which I don't see because it has very decent and satisfying acting and it has a good story. This is a war movie and wars are supposed to have tons of action and explosions and fighting. That's what this movie has. It has more action than the previous Terminator movies.<br/><br/>Just enjoy the movie and accept it for what it is. It's effing' fun and full of excitement. Definitely worth watching a second time. Lots of yelling and shooting and fighting."
"Rafacus","5","3","7","22 May 2009"," Lacking in substance, relevance and ultimately reason
","I really, really wished someone else would have written this movie. There were a lot of things wrong with Terminator Salvation, but this is coming from a person who has watched the prior three installments and the television series. To the average young movie watcher who doesn't know the entire cast of characters in John Connor's story, this film will come off as a mediocre sci-fi action thriller with a confusingly weak story.<br/><br/>Taking place after a Nuclear blast has wiped out much of the human race, John Connor (now a grizzled war vet) is one of the leaders of a revolutionary underground movement hell bent on taking back the earth from their machine masters. In the first two Terminator movies we are given a bit of history on this John Connor, how he loved people, how his selflessness and bravado was enough to make them forget their fears and fight back against the zerg. What I saw in Christian Bale's version of John Connor was a hardened loner-type, showing little to no emotion aside from the few times he was with his pregnant wife. This version did not feel like the leader we were made to believe led the revolution, he just lacked the sort of charisma that you would expect a guy like that to hold. He did not go through the ranks touching men on their shoulders and giving the fighters that reassuring eye to let them know he has their back the tiny hints that a viewer looks for to confirm their belief that this man was their saviour, just weren't there. No, John seemed cold, too cold, his decisions were not democratic, his beliefs are dashed aside at a whim and he seems to have no recollection of his youth (Terminaor 2: Judgement Day) when a machine taught him to think and not allow blind hate to cloud his judgement. This John Connor has a deep hate for the machines and it is reinforced by an ancient tape recorder that plays his mother's instructions from the past. This wrong John Connor ruined it movie for me because he is the protagonist, yet his story, visage, and history are so wrong that it was hard to look past him and like the movie.<br/><br/>The story of Terminator Salvation felt like the piecing together of three different scripts being that it started out very well and ended up going nowhere fast. In the past movies we were led to believe that Skynet was so advanced and powerful, the only way out for the human race was to send someone back in the past to stop it from even starting. The Skynet we see in this movie is advanced at building cool machines and motorcycles (that lack any real AI). To recall Arnold's T-800 relentlessly doing detective work and searching for Sarah Connor in the first Terminator to seeing the T-600s in this movie (the obvious future of it all) walking blindly and being outsmarted by children, just didn't make sense whatsoever. Hell the explosions were pretty but I had absolutely no fear of the machine menace that ruled the world. This is not how I felt in the older movies. Remember how hopeless it seemed when the T-1000 chased the Connor family in T2, how it seemed nothing could stop it? It made you say to yourself, ""damn! How would you deal with 10 of those things if you can't even handle one in this movie!?"" Well somehow McG and crew forgot this tiny element because the dumb machines and clueless T-600 models are laughably bad at tracking anything.<br/><br/>Through all the horrible and forgettable writing that plagued this letdown, the best parts were the scenes with Marcus Wright (Sam Worthington) and Blair Williams (Moon Bloodgood). Not so much the chemistry, but the fact that they had the least annoying scenes in the entire thing. The action scenes which had Kyle Reese (Anton Yelchin) and John Connor (Christian Bale) seemed to be full of the most unrealistic coincidences to fall in their favor. The story behind Marcus Wright was probably the most interesting and would have benefited the movie if they delved into his past a bit more. The conflict in screen time between him and Connor did not flow well and it would have been better if they stayed with him and ditched Connor altogether.<br/><br/>In closing I will say that Terminator Salvation was pretty but lacking in substance, relevance and ultimately reason. There is nothing to be learned from this one and it neither wraps up the saga nor adds anything to it. The story was a huge waste of time and a disappointment. Moon Bloodgood was deliciously hot though I will give it that but only that."

","Really a huge improvement over Terminator 3. The story on 3 was not bad, but the direction was awful; yes there were a lot of action scenes, but the heavy mood was lightened too much. Remember, it is doomsday, the fall of civilization and possible extinction of humanity; and Terminator Salvation try to recover that dark and painful feeling. I applaud that.<br/><br/>The story fits well within the series, the actors do a good job. What brings the film a down, in my opinion, is that humans cannot compete with machines in brute force. No way! Bones cannot hold to nuclear powered steel. Humans cannot street fight with Terminators.<br/><br/>Besides that, I pretty much enjoyed the movie, much more after watching T3. I feel it redeemed the franchise, congratulations!"
"roystephen-81252","7","2","4","12 February 2016"," The new Arnold
","This is probably my least favourite Terminator movie, but it doesn't mean it's bad. As for the casting of Christian Bale as John Connor, I'm not sure. I was also disappointed not to see Claire Danes return in Kate Brewster's role (although I do like Bryce Dallas Howard). Anton Yelchin was probably not the best choice for the role of the young Kyle Reese, either.<br/><br/>It sounds as if I had problems mainly with the cast, but it is not the case. My real gripe is that Terminator: Salvation seems too small, too confined, both in its settings and story-wise. It doesn't really move the 'saga' forward, it feels rather like a forgettable episode in the grand scheme of events.<br/><br/>They did nail one thing perfectly, however: Marcus, the cyborg with human feelings. Sam Worthington is absolutely wonderful in Marcus's role, playing essentially a younger, updated and much more nuanced version of Arnold's terminator. He really makes the movie work."
"ericwatkinson","2","2","4","23 August 2015"," Almost A Complete Joke
","To begin with I really disliked the Technicolor's Oz process used to give the film its bleached out appearance, and this completely removed any of the vivid sense of reality found in the earlier Terminator films. Terminator Salvation looks and feels like a poorly conceived graphic novel, and due to the sharp stylistic break from the earlier films, it is very easy to forget that it is supposed to be a continuation of the Terminator franchise. <br/><br/>Bale's interpretation of the John Connor character comes across more like a stiff generic cutout hero figure, that could easily be pasted into any CGI summer action movie, and it is absolutely impossible to believe that this is supposed to be an extension of the same John Connor personality that we earlier saw in Terminators 2 & 3. The lack of a convincing John Connor character severely hurts the film, and the film would have been much more enjoyable, if it had a character with at least some of the same mannerism and speech patterns as the earlier renditions of John Connor. (When Spock came back from the dead, he may have acted strangely for one or two movies, but we still knew that he was Spock!)<br/><br/>The rest of the film is not very well cast also, and although I think that Korinna Moon Bloodgood is a complete knockout of a gorgeous woman, she simply isn't believable in the role of post apocalyptic jet fighter pilot. Her flight suit has obviously been tailored to hug her curves (think Seven of Nine from Star Trek Voyager) and there is one scene that is so cliché, in which Bloodgood removes her flight helmet and whips her beautiful long hair for the camera, that it is completely laughable! These people are supposed to be living during the aftermath of a nuclear war, how does this woman manage to keep her hair so long and luxurious, when supposedly there is barely enough food for everyone to eat? (Supposedly they crew was made to read Cormac Mccarthy's The Road, but apparently the book had little affect.)<br/><br/>The film reaches a low point in believability, when Bloodgood's character, Blair Williams, finds herself alone at an abandoned speedway near Los Angeles. The Williams character is confronted by a group of hostile male characters, who behave and sound like a bunch of stereotype Ozark hillbillies. Seriously, shouldn't these villains have been a little more ethnically diverse, given the fact that the scene was set in Souther California? <br/><br/>Unfortunately, however, the film's ultimate low-point occurs when it is revealed that John Connor needs an immediate heart transplant, and the half-human and half-machine Marcus Wright character volunteers his own heart so that John Connor may live. Oh come on now, talk about tacky shallow ploys used to prop up an extremely bad movie, well this is absolutely the cheapest emotional manipulation ever attempted by Hollywood, bar none!!!<br/><br/>However, the highlight of the film occurs when three of the main characters stop at an abandoned gas station in search of suppliers, only to find that the station is already occupied by unfriendly human survivors. Skynet detects a human presence at the gas station and sends in some previously unseen hunter killer robots to wipe them out. For better or worse, the new hunter killer robots look suspiciously like Transformers, but the action scene beginning at the gas station is absolutely the only time the film comes even remotely close to recapturing the magic of the earlier Terminator films.<br/><br/>If this film has any saving graces whatsoever, it is the respectable acting job put forth by Sam Worthington in portraying the half-human and half-machine Marcus Wright character, and also the passable acting job put forth by Anton Yelchin in portraying Kyle Reese. Other than that, the rest of the cast seemed to be phoning in their laughably flat performances."
"LeonLouisRicci","5","2","4","29 May 2013"," Lifeless and Heartless
","The Franchise did not need salvaging, until now. This is such a heartless Movie that it immediately will be relegated to the Junkyard right next to the Michael Bay pile. Sure it has a lot of CGI Action that is a prerequisite in this type of thing and it all looks like others that look alike. Metallic colorless things of varying proportions whiz around and explode.<br/><br/>This is a loud and noisy Film with very little to add to the Mythology and frankly, very little to say. The Dialog consists of short sentences that are themselves infrequent except to set up the next Whiz-Bang. Fanatics about the Terminator Movies will also be left speechless (yea right), and angry. Casual viewers may be more forgiving.<br/><br/>Overall it isn't an awful experience, it is just so familiar with its FX and computer screens and lifeless look that it cannot be anything more than ho-hum. Christian Bale, in an absolutely uninspired walk-through, leads a Cast of other line-readers that are as lifeless as the Movie. This is Art as Product and seems manufactured by an assembly line from a Non-Human Institution like Skynet."
"eileena20905","5","2","4","14 September 2011"," tried, but it's just not up to the gold standard (the originals)
","both terminator and terminator II were absolutely fantastic movies - in different ways; i love them both, and each of them are wonderful for what they are. the third movie is weaker, but still links in a not-unimportant way to the first two movies in keeping with how John and Sarah Connor are important to saving the future. however - James Cameron's vision was sorely lacking in the third, as was Linda Hamilton. i adore her.<br/><br/>this fourth movie lacks several things. Cameron's vision - his ability to pull a movie together into a cohesive, tight, yet visionary flow - is incredible, and badly missing. Christian Bale's acting is seriously flawed. he alternates between wooden and angry, with no nuance. once again (as in batman), i do not see why people think this actor has the ability to carry a film. last but not least, the plot is not cohesive and believable to me. the *only* saving grace among the actors is perhaps the scene where the terminator sacrifices himself for John Connor - and Christian Bale ruins that scene as well.<br/><br/>i was generous with giving it 5/10 stars; i felt the special effects and the cinematography, along with costuming and set design, gave the film the proper feel. in other words, the people behind the actors, writers, and director are what bumps this movie up to a 5."

In most movies the star or crook gets a thumping, ask why their faces don't come out in swellings and fat lips, this is your non realistic effects.

"ozziemovielover","5","2","4","9 June 2011"," Special effects laden disappointment
","I had high hopes for this movie especially seeing as it was a reboot and as Christian bale was starring in one of the lead roles. I was really disappointed with this move for several reasons. First off, Christian was absolutely terrible in this film. It felt like he made absolutely no effort when he was acting in this movie. He was way better in the dark knight. Secondly, I felt that the story line was to thin. It was more like a half hour TV episode. It just wasn't dark enough. The future was a lot grittier and darker in Kyle reese's flashbacks in terminator 1. In those flashbacks, you really felt like humanity was right on the brink of annihilation. However, in terminator salvation the viewer just doesn't get that impression. The resistance has all the latest technology and humanity hasn't been pushed to the brink of extinction. All in all Im quite disappointed with the storyline but I was impressed by the special effects. Maybe Hollywood should have devoted a bit more of the budget to the script. This movie just does not compare to terminator 2"
"TheUnknown837-1","5","2","4","20 September 2010"," One inevitably ranks it in comparison to the first three and by that contrast, it is in serious need of help
","As an enormous fan of the first three Terminator movies, conceived and originally directed by James Cameron in the early 80s, I had a lot of hope and apprehension for the fourth film in the saga, unimaginatively titled ""Terminator Salvation."" First of all, because I knew it was going to make some serious deviations from the atmosphere and quality of the original three films. It's not just the departure of Arnold Schwarzenegger as the humanlike, stone-faced automaton. It's the departure from the present into the future, from slightly comic to overly Gothic and incredibly schmaltzy, from beautiful cinematography to corny cinematography, and ultimately from a good story with memorable characters to an old-hat story with old-hat characters. But even on its own terms, if we were to shuck out the existence of the first three pictures, I don't think ""Terminator Salvation"" would hold up well. Not for me, at least.<br/><br/>The previous three movies took place in the present but kept looking to the future, to a time when a cyberspace computer called Skynet would take over the planet with an arsenal of weapons including manlike automatons called terminators. The plot of those movies was to ensure the birth and survival of John Connor, who would lead the humans to victory. Now, save for a brief prologue, we are wrapped entirely in this future world. John Connor (Christian Bale) is trying to inspire people to fight as the robots tear things apart around them. In the midst, we have a good cyborg (Sam Worthington) and his human sidekick (Moon Youngblood). And all around this is a tiresome formula of setup and gun battles that never advance toward anything but a larger gun battle at the end.<br/><br/>What was so special about the first three Terminator movies was their complex stories and plots. ""Terminator Salvation"" is structured and plays (and looks) like a video game. The whole purpose is not to bother with time travel, ensuring survival, or anything. It pretends to be, but it's nothing more than the protagonist going from Point A to Point B and on to Point C. And along the way, he must take out some baddies, which he does. Also gone are those memorable characters. Remember when John Connor was a smart but vulgar kid and then a smart but vulgar deadbeat? Now he's a dumb and boring middle-aged man with laryngitis since Mr. Bale is still acting on his Batman note. If you're going to put us in the future, where John Connor is leading a resistance against a man-made enemy, then we need to feel that. Not here. John Connor is just a stick figure in the background and as dull as a beige room. And the protagonist, though well-played by Sam Worthington, is only slightly more interesting only because there's a little depth with his character's past. The picture also throws in lots of references to classic moments of the first three, but they are so banally positioned that they become predictable and the charm is lost. The film even fails to be kitschy, nostalgic fun.<br/><br/>I didn't care at all about the virtually nonexistent story in ""Terminator Salvation"" and I didn't particularly like its visual appearance, either. The special effects are quite nice, but they are detracted from by some cornball, grainy cinematography with flamboyant, over-the-top lighting mixed with moments of murky, shadow-swamped darkness. Like many other apocalyptic pictures, there's always a big dust cloud hanging over every scene, because the filmmakers didn't stop to think of how it original it would seem if these vicious battles took place under a clear, blue sky.<br/><br/>To the movie's credit, it is well-made. Its maker, a man named McG, is a very talented filmmaker. His skill with the camera and set pieces is what ultimately saves the picture from being a fiasco, not Mr. Bale or Mr. Worthington's presence. But he has zip of a story to work with and as a result, the first two-thirds of the picture are very tiresome. I must admit that the final third of the movie, consisting of a brilliant final battle, is truly exhilarating and this carves a big notch in the movie's forty-five. It is better for a movie to have a better ending than beginning, for that leaves an impression on the audience as they leave. But in hindsight, I would rather not watch the first hour and a half just to enjoy the battle again.<br/><br/>Performances are mixed. Christian Bale is surprisingly dull and routine in his scenes as John Connor and this is a rare thing for me: spotting a Christian Bale performance without any charisma. Sam Worthington is a talented actor and he does best with what he has. Bryce Dallas Howard and Moon Youngblood are good, but mechanical in their mechanical roles. And Anton Yelchin is not able to overcome his unbelievably bad dialogue and make a likable character. To his credit, few could have. I look forward to seeing him, and all of these people, in better movies."
"kenpo1980","7","2","4","2 May 2010"," Actually kind of liked it....
","I was really excited to see this movie in the theater after seeing the previews and learning Christian Bale was on board but after all the Luke warm reviews I decided to hold off until it made it's way to cable.<br/><br/>I honestly have to admit that I kind of liked the film. First, in the interest of full disclosure, I am a fan of the first two Terminator films I was never obsessed with them and so I didn't go into this film looking for it to recapture the feel of the first two. I was just looking for an entertaining action film with decent acting and I felt it delivered on both of these levels.<br/><br/>As a side note, I have to begrudgingly admit that Sam Worthington was perfectly cast in his role. I am not saying that he justifies all of the hype he is receiving but I was much more impressed with his role in this film than I was by his role in Avatar."
"gav_mcf","7","2","4","1 May 2010"," Exiting entry to the series from McG with a winning performance from Sam Worthington
","I will admit, upon hearing the news that McG (Charlies Angels 1 & 2) was going to be directing this I wasn't sure it was a good choice but I decided to give him a chance (after all look how many people doubted the choice of Heath Ledger as the Joker) and after seeing Terminator Salvation in the cinema I thought it was decent enough but nothing great. I decided to give it another chance on DVD and I enjoyed it a lot more, maybe its one of those that needs another viewing to appreciate it.<br/><br/>As soon as the film starts you know it is going to be nothing like the previous films and it has a totally different feel. We are introduced to Sam Worthington's Marcus Wright in a 2003 prologue which is very intriguing and before we know it we are in 2018 with Christian Bale as John Connor with the resistance trying to infiltrate a Skynet base.<br/><br/>These openings perfectly set up the films two leading men but it's Worthington's Marcus who emerges as the main character, he has most of the screen time and a much fuller story arc. It is well known that more story was added to Connor when Bale expressed an interest so maybe its not entirely surprising. Anyway, the opening battle sequence at Skynet is fantastic and McG creates a gritty war atmosphere that James Cameron hinted to in the previous films. Overall the production design of the destroyed landscapes are fantastic.<br/><br/>Other great action sequences include Marcus being ambushed by a T-600 in post-apocalyptic L.A., Connor's team wrestling with some Hydrobots (think mechanical anacondas) but the stand-out has to be an extended chase scene with Marcus, Kyle Reese and the young Star (Jadagrace Berry) facing back-to-back encounters with a spinning disc-like tracker, a massive Harvester, awesome Moto-Terminators and a Hunter Killer (seriously!). The whole sequence brims with excitement and kudos to McG for producing such a great scene.<br/><br/>TS also thankfully has a winning cast, Christian Bale brings his usual growl and intensity to John Connor and adds something totally different from the previous two films to the role. Anton Yelchin is perfect as a young Kyle Reese and is perhaps the most anticipated character to see in the next one, Moon Bloodgood deserves a mention as pilot Blair Williams as she makes a big impact for the amount of screen time shes given, her and Worthington also build a good chemistry. On that note, Sam Worthington as the mysterious Marcus Wright is my favourite character in the film, the Avatar man brings charisma and vulnerability to a role thats quite difficult to play because he isn't allowed to give too much away but he never comes across bland, there are also a few interesting twists along the way with him. Michael Ironside is good as always as the Resistance commander and has some fun exchanges with Bale. Unfortunately Bryce Dallas Howard and rapper Common don't really add anything, although they should get more screen time in future installments.<br/><br/>There are also tributes to the earlier entries which are good, there are many but to name a few are the use of ""You Could Be Mine"" by Guns 'N' Roses at a very apt time, the usual ""Come with me if you want to live"" delivered well by Yelchin and Bale utters the line ""I'll be back"" which is pure genius and totally unexpected (I remember the reaction at the cinema).<br/><br/>OK the film has a couple of minor hiccups such as the final sequence, don't get me wrong it's not bad but nowhere near as good as the big chase scene. Sorry if this is a spoiler but I wasn't that impressed with Arnie's CGI cameo, it seemed a bit of place and not really necessary. Just a thought but how much better and creepier would it have been if Bale stumbled into a production room and there were hundreds of Arnie's Terminator on a big production line not yet activated and ready to launch... would've been cheaper to do as well because they would just be still figures and in my view a much more effective way in introducing us back to the iconic original Terminator.<br/><br/>These are minor gripes however and huge credit must go to McG for bringing the Terminator franchise back to life and I can't wait for him to explore it even more (who were those figures behind the glass panel in the human camp? Is there human involvement in Skynet!?). I can't understand why this film got such a negative reaction in America and under the circumstances I think it is realistically the best film we could've asked for, if not very close. For the record it is way better than T3.<br/><br/>I wondered what was next for Terminator when Halycon went bust but Lionsgate are apparently close to obtaining the rights and if they do I hope they let McG and his team continue their trilogy and not do a pointless reboot of this one or the original. The future is in their hands now."

","This movie sucked. It was hard to tell it was even related to the Terminator series. The story and writing was horrible. They even had Bale saying ""I'll be back."" Was that supposed to be funny? Also, at one time they say that Kyle Reese is number 1 target of Skynet and John Connor was number 2. So how come the machines capture Kyle, yet don't kill him. And when Connor fights the t800, why doesn't the machine just bash his head in. The absolute worst fight. John Connor's wife served no purpose. Why didn't they just hire a no name actress for the role.<br/><br/>Also, they made this film pg 13, taking away all the cool things the machines could do.<br/><br/>FINAL VERDICT: A horrible sci fi movie."
"eatpajdittsvin","6","2","4","12 March 2010"," Decent action film
","Salvation is a good action movie, but not excellent. It had to carry a lot of weight from its predecessors which it doesn't rise up to, but on its own it certainly makes for an entertaining watch.<br/><br/>Perhaps the overall plot remains the weakest link in the movie... Why would Skynet choose such a complicated approach to winning the war? After all, a slow and repetitive war of attrition is what you'd think it'd be good at. Not some unnecessarily dangerous twisted ""let our enemies reach our heart to become most vulnerable""-plan.<br/><br/>As a side note the sub plot of the human terminator ex-convict could have been developed further since it is pretty interesting.<br/><br/>Acting is good, and whenever there's an irritation it can be blamed on the weak script. An example would be the kid which by not saying a single line in the entire movie (conveniently assigned as a mute), as well as using 1 single ""sad poor child"" facial expression, becomes more boring and machine-like than the robots she's supposedly fighting. I guessed they were aiming for a Newt but got a mute...<br/><br/>I thought post-nuclear future would be even more grim and dark than it appeared in Salvation. It's not a biggie, but seeing the same clear blue sky in many scenes as of what I see every other day in Summer does not embroil me with an apocalyptic feeling. There's not enough dirt. There's not enough blood. It feels quite clean in fact, which perhaps is because it's intended to fit a younger audience. (But somehow most of my friends had managed to watch The Terminator by age 9-10 regardless, more than a decade ago.)<br/><br/>Some of the action sequences were a bit silly or over the top. Ordinary human characters getting beaten several times and still standing up? Check. Bullets being fired from a mini gun mounted on a terminator but not hitting anything? Check. Robot motor bikers springing out from a giant walking robot's legs? Check. But note that I said ""some"", and I'll have to give an overall positive score for the action sequences.<br/><br/>Salvation is not a nail biter like Terminator or Aliens. One will have little doubt in how it will end from the very beginning. It may partially be the fault that instead of the gloomy predictions of nuclear war in the earlier movies, we instead have the predictions that machines must eventually lose (or at least be delayed long enough for Kyle Reese to be sent back in time) in Salvation. Foreshadowing can be important for conveying an ominous mood throughout a film, which this one lacks compared to its predecessors.<br/><br/>So, my final grade is: Watch this if you enjoy action movies. Chances are you will not find many redeeming qualities if action is not your genre, but strong acting and action together brings a lot of value alone for the right kind of viewer. It also helps if you don't come with the expectation that this should be as good as Terminator 1 or 2."

","There's nothing salvageable about Terminator Salvation.<br/><br/>The first Terminator movie was good, ground-breaking even. It was an excellent concept.<br/><br/>The second was extraordinary (one of the best films ever made). I literally get an increase in heart rate when I think about certain scenes from that movie.<br/><br/>The third Terminator movie was alright. It didn't capture the magic of T2, but it didn't disappoint either.<br/><br/>The fourth Terminator film was depressingly bad. It was nothing more than a monstrosity of loud, pointless noise and desperate overacting. Why did John Connor need to shout every single word that came out of his mouth? Even when the person he was talking to was right next to him and there was no need to yell? This was so annoying.<br/><br/>The plot was ridiculous; the characters were weak. I hated it.

","...we basically gave into McG's scam, we basically demanded more after the awful T3. It's easy to see, really- the series ended at T2 for me. No need to continue after T2.<br/><br/>Who is this McG dude again? Oh right, he's some douche bag with a ridiculous moniker (McG??????) and has only directed a handful of movies and a couple rap videos. Yep, that's right, we have a guy with almost no experience in film directing a film in a franchise that's very easy to screw up: Terminator. And you know something's up when T3, which was also a piece of crap, starts looking like a good movie in comparison to the newest crappy entry in the series.<br/><br/>Christian Bale is in this movie, which is unfortunately a missed opportunity as well. It's no wonder he had a meltdown on the set of this movie- nobody can blame him. This movie is pure muck. I saw this on opening weekend, and walked away as satisfied as much as I was when seeing ""9"" (in other words, not satisfied). Like I mentioned before, this is a very easy franchise to f--k up, and McG did just that.<br/><br/>There's literally nothing to spoil in here. There's basically no plot except something about protecting the universe. The action scenes are very poorly done, with the shaky camera and quick cutting (WHEN WILL DIRECTORS STOP SHAKING THE GODDAMN CAMERA!!!!!!). I could hardly tell what was going on. The acting is awful- except for the excellent performance by Anton Yelchin, who is someone I don't usually like. But even he can't save the movie from sucking out loud. And Sam Worthington is a wasted opportunity here- he was AMAZING in Avatar, and horrible in this too... also, I'm a real Bonham-Carter fanboy, yet she even sucked in this too. The dialogue is terrible (""We have won the battle, but we haven't won the war""??? I think I heard that on an episode of Power Rangers). Yep, you guessed it, this movie sucks out loud"
"prbocchi","5","2","4","1 January 2010"," Does nothing for the Terminator franchise storyline.
","I will do this in point form; <br/><br/><ul><li>In short, not a great movie, but if you're into action with little supporting plot, then you will probably like this.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The main disappointment with TS is that there was a lot of potential and a lot of the work had already been done in the previous movies. Unfortunately this movie flushes most of this potential down the drain.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>This movie is better than T3, (not hard), but nowhere near as good as T1 and T2.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Lots of action and chase scenes. But without a strong supporting story, they just seem superfluous.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The main thing that stuck out for me in this movie was how ineffective skynet was despite it's awesome technological advantage. E.g. Skynet captured Kyle Reese, but for some reason didn't kill him despite him being #1 on the Skynet hit-list. Why? Same with John Conner. All a terminator has to do is crush his throat, or break his neck, crush his skull, etc. However, it looks like terminators are programmed to toss their victims around like a cat playing with a half-dead mouse. Another example is at the petrol station where a monstrous robot seems quite inefficient at killing a few humans getting away in rusted old cars. And then it has a real hard time stopping Marcus getting away in a tow-truck where it suddenly loses it's ability to aim. This lack of logic for the sake of drawing out action scenes just ruins a movie for me.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>There seems to be many inconsistencies with weapon damage and terminator robustness. In some cases a grenade launcher will just blow off some skin, but next time around has the ability to blow a terminator several meters backwards through the air.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>What is the point of this movie anyway? The main point seems to be to save Kyle Reese. But it would have been better if the movie ended with John sending Kyle back in time so that at least it gave you a sense of purpose or closing a loop in the story. Instead, the movie is centered around saving Kyle (which Skynet had many opportunities to kill anyway) and then they blow up some part of Skynet.... and that's it. Ummmm, OK, and...? How did this movie add to the Terminator story or answer questions? In fact a Terminator 5 movie could be made by virtually totally ignoring this movie altogether.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Why would John Conner let Marcus go knowing he is Skynet built? Marcus knows the location of his base. Surely a real-life John would realize that Marcus was built for infiltration. In this respect John just pulls down his pants, bends over the table and says ""come and give it to me Skynet"". The same goes with the female pilot, Bloodgood. She knows Marcus for two days, and when she finds out he is a cyborg, decides to rescue him because she believes ""he's human"". Never mind the fact he is a cyborg with computer chips in his head, he seems like a nice guy. With this type of thinking it's amazing there is any resistance left. Absolutely illogical.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>In T3, Arnie's terminator says that he kills him, but is reprogrammed and sent back to protect him. But in this movie this same apparent terminator is blown up in the nuclear explosion.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Another illogical thing is the terminator motorbikes. John is able to capture one, reprogram it and then ride off on it like a normal motorbike assuming that for some illogical reason the bike has a seat, pedals, and controls that would allow a human to ride it.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Time travel is not mentioned or hinted at in any way that I recall. I may be being picky, but just another example of how the movie doesn't address any of the storyline in the previous movies.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Security at Skynet at the end seems very lax. OK we see Marcus disable one or two security measures, but overall, infiltrating Skynet seems like a walk in the park.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>John is mentioned to be considered as a prophet by some, but there is no explanation or story related to how John obtained this status. He is simply introduced in the opening text as such.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>There seems to be many dead-ends in the movie. E.g. What's with Kyle's mute side-kick? Seemed like a pointless character. The old woman in the petrol station also seems to be a character who is introduced who goes nowhere. There is no explanation as to why skynet is taking prisoners. I assume as workers, but I don't recall this being explained. The love interest between Bloodgood and Marcus also seems to be pointless, other than her illogically rescuing him. What was her intention? To run off to Las Vegas and get married to him? </li></ul><br/><br/>Overall a very, very, thin storyline and doesn't do much for the Terminator franchise. I can only rate it for it's pure action entertainment value.<br/><br/>If you want your brain to take a rest and be entertained by eye candy and explosions, then you just many like this movie. If you're a real terminator fan I believe you will be very disappointed at the lack of storyline."
"Mikey_0782","3","2","4","3 December 2009"," Not a proper Terminator
","What did we get before from Terminator movies ? A big and strong robot, played by Schwarzy, walking towards firing cops completely unharmed and either being disabled by some stunned civilians or disabling an even more evolved robot named T-1000 or T-X. You also get lots of humor, either from the reactions of the terminator (the basic Schwarzy humor, finding completely normal some of his amazing abilities, some critical situations or some troubling decision one could have to make in those situations) or from John Connor as a teenager discovering his control over that amazing robot or as a young adult being used to chaotic situations like the ones depicted in the Terminator movies. This is the ""Terminator"" idea, it has worked 3 times, because ""YES"" I believe Terminator 3 was a success and was made in the true spirit of that franchise.<br/><br/>Terminator 4 is a big flop in my point of view. Connor is now in the military, while I expected him to be more of a fighting civilian, isn't that what the resistance is supposed to be ? This Marcus Wright character comes out of nowhere... Sam Worthington playing him could probably work a lot more on his acting skills (so could Christian Bale for that matter). The humor is gone, Schwarzy's gone (replaced by some look-alike for about 10 seconds), John Connor is actually gone as well since he's now some kind of Rambo... Shortly said, the reason why people liked Terminator movies up until now is that it wasn't like this T4 movie.<br/><br/>It's like going from Predator 1 to Predator 2... same enemy, but completely different movies, and the second one sucked ! The reason why we like sequels like the ""Bourne"" ones, or the ""Ocean's"" ones, or even the ""Lethal Weapon"" ones, is that you get the same characters, the same humor, the same kind of set up and thus you keep the same public. Change all that, you just changed fans.<br/><br/>3/10 for the visual effects and the bike-terminators, those ones were actually really cool !"

"H_Spengler","8","2","4","29 August 2009"," Pleasantly surprised!!
","I was nervous about a ""PG-13"" Terminator film, so I put off seeing this for quite a while after it came out...however curiosity and being a fan of the other Terminator films won out.<br/><br/>I have to admit I really enjoyed this movie. I needed the bad taste that was ""Transformers 2"" washed away and this did the trick.<br/><br/>The Good:<br/><br/>Sam Worthington. One of the two best performances in the movie (he was recommended to McG by both Cameron & Russell Crowe.) It's nice to see that Terminator can still be a great story even if John Connor isn't your main focus. (and honestly it was about time some character rotation took place, no offense, I still love the other T films.) I really could feel emotion for and beside him (and his predicament.) I really wish they had given his character more development and room for a possible sequel or spin-off instead of his ultimately disappointing end.<br/><br/>Anton Yelchin. Continually surprises me with the range he shows in his acting. He had huge shoes to fill with Kyle Reese, and he did a great job. At times I could actually feel him channeling the Kyle of T1 through him. Well done, between this and Star Trek he's having a great year!<br/><br/>I thought the desolate look of the future was great. Thankfully McG directs masterfully and is the ""Anti-Michael Bay."" No sickening ""Cloverfield""esque shaky cam, or constant huge explosions needlessly in cities for the sake of just blowing things up. What's blown up here has a purpose for blowing up (for the most part.)<br/><br/>I thought the story was OK, there wasn't a whole lot script-wise that bothered me or stuck out as dumb or corny. (There are a few sub-plots and dialog scenes that I can nit pick at, but nothing too major.) I liked the T-800 cameo too. (I know it wasn't really Arnold, but it really made for a nice connection to the previous movies.)<br/><br/>The Bad:<br/><br/>Christian Bale. Sorry, and i'm a Bale fan. He just seemed as if he was sleepwalking his way through. Although some of his performance comes across as genuine, most of the time it's borderline wooden. I also didn't care for the ""shallowness"" portion that came through on his prejudiced feelings towards the machines, even though by now he's well into the war and know that with the right programming the terminators can be turned. (Also the writer's seem to have forgotten the experiences he's had in the past knowing it's possible for a terminator to learn and change.)<br/><br/>The female element. Helena Bonham Carter is without a doubt the most interesting female in this movie, and her screen time is around 5 minutes. McG has said with his casting of Bloodgood he was hoping to continue with the ""strong woman persona"" of the previous movies. But I fail to see that in her. There was nothing particularly memorable about her, nor that strong. Pure placement as a ""romantic interest"" to be vulnerable around Worthington. <br/><br/>Howard puts in a small role. There's nothing great about her, nor anything bad, she's just there. The pregnant wife/doctor. Since it was not deemed to advance her character at all, I can't say anything about her either way.<br/><br/>The resistance is hidden underground in a secret labyrinth, avoiding any explosions, noise, lights, etc. as to avoid detection by the machines, but when Worthington's character escapes, all hell breaks loose above ground. Guys with lights and guns waving them about and shooting, multiple helicopters, not to mention a huge hell fire bombing of the forest terrain above. Even if they thought he was going back to report to the machines, would they really want to deal with all the enemy attention they have undoubtedly just drawn to themselves? <br/><br/>As mentioned above, lame ending for Worthington. How can they even be sure that his heart would work and be compatible with John? And how lame is it to think that not only does John Connor have to worry about machines constantly coming after him, but life long possibility of organ rejection as well?! Even if the whole purpose for ending the movie was Worthington's character somehow die, you're telling me that's the best you can come up with?! Come on!<br/><br/>But all in all, I thought it was a pretty good movie. It held my attention, was entertaining, and I didn't feel ripped off leaving the theater...will add to DVD collection. 8/10"
"Robert_duder","8","2","4","23 August 2009"," A new style and turn for the franchise but will it be a good turn?
","The Terminator trilogy, in particular the first two films are iconic and defined a whole new genre of action film. The films balanced this blend of absolutely incredible special effects, horror like plot, and an action superstar Arnold Schwarzenegger in one of the most infamous characters in movie history. So any attempt to create a follow up to the film series that leaves behind modern day to pick up in the future after Judgement Day, eliminates Schwarzenegger and ages hero John Connor by a couple decades is going to be risky and its going to change the entire feel of the film and that is what happens. Also special effects have come a long way so that what we saw in T2 doesn't necessarily impress the same as it does now. Still Terminator Salvation has some great scenes, and still capitalizes on some of the things that are staples to the Terminator series like the T-(enter model number here) with the familiar Terminator hybrid face, the pounding music, and familiar characters established in earlier installments. However, somehow Salvation was missing the epic feel that even Terminator 3 seem to have although it was starting to turn more mainstream by then.<br/><br/>Latest Hollywood action star Christian Bale joins the cast as leader of the resistance John Connor who has been played by numerous actors over the years in film and Television. Bale does his usual Batman impression with his customary growly voice and shocked expression on his face. While he carries the film decently he just feels like a one trick pony and I wouldn't be disappointed to see them replace Connor again. I'm thinking someone with more chemistry and charisma on screen. Sam Worthington actually outshines Bale as former human turned Cyborg, Marcus. He just seems to be more heroic, and has a better fit to the film and his character and story to the series is intriguing. I would rather see them base future installments off of his character and bring him back to play the part. Anton Yelchin, who I have had high hopes for since early in his career. He plays the young Kyle Reese and although certainly doesn't look the part he actually does a great job. Actually Yelchin could have played a good John Connor in his young days which probably makes him the perfect person to play Connor's father although they don't know this yet because of the whole time travel aspect...complex in a way. Bale was the weak link in the three main stars of the film sadly.<br/><br/>As popular a director as ""McG"" seems to be he really hasn't done anything of real substance. His films have been fast paced and chaotic and mostly pure adrenaline without a lot of meat to them ie: Charlies Angels, and TV's short lived Fastlane. He attempts to follow in the footsteps of epic director James Cameron and Jonathan Mostow who is and will be a great storyteller (ever seen the Kurt Russell film breakdown?) and his next film Surrogates is one of my most anticipated sci-fi films this year. Basically McG wants to blow things up, fight with weapons, and then tell a bit of a story to go along with it and for Terminator that recipe doesn't necessarily make a great sequel. I want to get back to the epic post apocalyptic story!! Still it was great to have another entry in the series and bringing Schwarzenegger back even if it was digitally was kick-ass cool. The mini plot and eventual battle between Schwarzenegger's legendary T-800 and Bale's Connor was downright awesome. Worth seeing but if they are trying to reboot or kick start the franchise we need more depth!! 8/10"

","I really didn't want to dislike this movie, but it was unavoidable. Having in mind that T4 succeeded such classics like T1 and T2, I expected something worth seeing. Alas. Bad plot, setting, special effects and dialogs.<br/><br/>>>>Abandon hope all you who enter here! <<<<br/><br/>WARNING: S P O I L E R S follow:<br/><br/>First of all, the plot lacks originality and it lacks it badly. The idea of an antagonist neglecting the ""free-will"" human factor and paying dearly for it dates back probably to the dawn of the movie era. Did anyone doubt that Sam Worthington would not do what Helena Carter told him to? <br/><br/>And I feel sorry for Skynet. This is the only inventive and progressive character in the all T-series, but the moment it invents some magnificent piece of technology, the humans break it. And this never ends - T1, T2, T3, T4, T5 (oh, no, dear Hollywood, I promise I'll be good from now on, do not do this). In this regard, I must say that the whole Terminator-thing begins to look and sound like a never-ending story or a soap opera.<br/><br/>The future in 2029 (e.g. in T2) looks like it is supposed to: like a nightmare. The future in 2018 looks dusty and unconvincing. What was this flawless sky after an apocalyptic nuclear war? I got the impression that the world had been devastated by a giant tornado rather than massed nuclear bombings.<br/><br/>In 2018 the human race fights the machines with fighter-jets, helicopters and even a submarine. In 2029 the remnants of the humans act like guerrillas with the bazooka being their most dangerous weapon. Obviously the war is going not quite well for us. How do we win at the end then?<br/><br/>Christian Bale is a good actor, but he tends to act too dramatically. Does he ever smile?"

","OOoh! Mindless action sequences, explosions and car chases followed by; more mindless action sequences, explosions and Batman! In the near future, where machines have not quite taken over and the resistance is not quite as desperate yet, a Manbot is facing existential crisis. Lucky for us, he teams up with plucky side kicks and then decides to travel north, instead of wallowing in his existential problema. Lot's of destruction and mayhem will follow. Then there is the mandatory hot chick ,doing the damsel in distress routine, while trying to look as sexy as possible.<br/><br/>Then there is John Batman Connor, who is not quite the mysterious resistance leader we were lead to believe, but rather a boring fellow with raspy (Batman!) voice. He trying to make use of this soundwave device, but as a plot point, it's incredibly dull. He also has a cute wife who looks incredibly fresh in a post apocalyptic world.<br/><br/>Terminator 4 isn't really a terminator movie. It's a collection of average action sci-fi flicks of the recent past. It is a collection of worn out ideas and clichés. Gone are themes of paranoia and possible futures and destinies. Even the world around the characters is something taken out of recent video games and the latest Resident evil movie.<br/><br/>Terminator 4 doesn't add anything into the broader story line. Did we really need to know what Kyle Reese was like as a teenager? The whole movie seems pointless."

","The Post-Apoclyptic world looks great. It's not like James Cameron's vision, but its a different future. 2018 makes it a good time into the war, with a big gap. But why is it always Los Angeles? How about other cities/countries? The plot was OK, but it had SO many holes in it, that it really sticks out a while after you've seen it. Why is John Connor the ONLY survivor from that first battle? Why is John Connor so suicidal, that he'll jump into a stormy ocean to get to a sub? Why don't the Terminators just kill humans instead of throwing them around? Why did John Connor go alone to Skynet? Why did he meet almost no Terminators there? How could he reprogram and Mototerminator in about 10 seconds? It goes on and on. Now for the characters John Connor was just mediocre, it's how you'd expect him to be by this point. Marcus was an interesting character, being half machine and half human (another series of plot holes with that) and has a bad past. Anton Yelchin was great as Kyle Reese, I could definitely see the Michael Biehn in him. Blair Williams was OK, she was the only one who trusted that Marcus was good. Kate Connor didn't do much and only had a few scenes, same with Barnes (why didn't he just go with John Connor to Skynet?). Many people though of Star as a pointless character. I disagree. She brings innocence to an otherwise dark setting and imagine going through this post-apocalyptic world as a kid? The action/effects were Great, Great, Great. Lots of good action scenes with variety. Thanks to ILM and Stan Winston Studios (May he rest in peace). The Arnold CGI was great and about 95% photo-realistic.Overall, its decent, but far from perfect. It really suffers from a lot of plot holes and choppy pacing. I give it a 7/10."

","The moment the movie started I was excited and enjoyed the opening scene with Sam Worthington. Then once the film started focusing on Christian Bale I started to get a little bored. Bales performance was like watching him portray his role as batman in the dark knight which was terrible no wonder people liked Heath Ledger so much. This is the problem with bale when he lowers his voice he thinks he will hide his annoying accent well guess what Mr bale it doesn't!. Sam Worthington showed to me he has what it takes to be a leading man in a movie even tho they gave him second billing in this film.<br/><br/>The CGI was decent enough. The scene with the Mech Terminator was pretty amazing to watch. The Nuclear bomb scenes were a little bit of a let down. There wasn't enough terminators in this film I guess thats because its only 2018 and the war carries on past 2029.<br/><br/>Now for the story which i quite enjoyed. It seemed at some points in the movie not all just some that it was a bit rushed. So overall I'm giving it a 7."

","Let me make one thing perfectly clear as I possibly can, this is not an arnold terminator movie, this is not a time traveling robot that everyone has grown love over the past 25 years but this is the future war that everyone has been expecting to see. So everyone in their I love arnold mindset better throw it away, get real you already know he is too old to be doing those terminator parts, so get that little bug out of your heads. The thing with movies is you are not always going to get what you want(if that was the case we'd all be directing and making our own movies)so sometimes you as a fan are going to have to give into the movie instead of the movie always giving in to you. Christian bale as john connor was better than all the other people in the past who played john connor, he played a great leader, he brought us a grittier john connor, he lived up to the john connor we expecting to see judging by all of the flashbacks in the first 3 movies and I truly enjoyed his character. The special effects were off the chart(yes even the CGI arnold was cool)this movie introduced you to old and new terminators or other machines that are trying to kill us in the near future lol. Sam Worthington was fantastic and he picked up where arnold left off as a protector in this movie and did a great job at it. Yes he did lack size compared to arnold's character of the past but his acting was so much better than arnold that it made up for it. The movie did a good job telling and showing the 2 story method just like the 3 before it by showing john's story and then marcus' story, and then you just them come together. That scene when marcus and john first meet was intense and kept you on the edge of your seat because us as the audience knew that marcus wasn't a villain and we were looking at john as if he were crazy but from john's point of view he was paraniod, he had the whole stone cold steve austin ""don't trust anybody"" mindset. My only complaint was they didn't show enough kyle reese, they could have did more with him you know just give him a couple of more scenes because soemtimes you forget that he's even in the movie. But overall I give that movie a 8 out of 10, my suggestion is for the critics or people who watch this movie is to let go of the first 3 and to get in gear with this new one(out with the old and in with the new)."

At the end of T3, which I actually liked unlike some people (don't worry I know it's nowhere near the Cameron films but it holds it's own), we see the machines breaking loose and brutally mowing people down. At the time, I wish we could see more of that. It was then, at the end of T3, that I couldn't wait for T4, when we would see the violent future. <br/><br/>Now, this movie, Terminator Salvation. It's rated PG-13. That should tell you a couple things. First off, whoever is releasing this movie only has money in mind. It's money over quality for them. Secondly, we aren't gonna see the violent future we were longing to see since T3 ended. Sure this movie has 'action'. However it's done in such a way that, well, it's totally okay for the kids. Also, I guess you could say the action is 'McG style', which is definitely not close to 'James Cameron style'. That grit present in the previous movies is just not anywhere to be found here. No genuinely intense scenes. Just a load of generic-ness. <br/><br/>There are a few good things about the movie. Like there are a variety of Terminators, which was okay. You have to admit those motorbike bots were made just for the sake of being cool though. Some of the action is actually kinda stylish and you could tell McG was trying his best in some parts (like the chopper crash from the cockpit POV). <br/><br/>Now I feel like I'm forgetting something...oh yeah...John CONNAH! Hehe...the man of the movie (I bet you'll get sick of hearing his name by the time the movie is over). The Balezor! Okay sorry. Yeah I'm just gonna say what a lot of people have said (and they were right) - Christian Bale is nothing special in this movie. He doesn't make you feel anything at all. Now I know it probably wasn't his fault, could be the script or whatever but I'm just saying. Also, I'm still very curious about something. Y'all remember earlier this year when Bale tripped out and effed up the DP right? Now that I've seen the movie, I can't see a point in Bale's performance that was so intense, that if he was interrupted he'd have to get so angry. If anyone knows what scene it was let me know please, because I can't tell.<br/><br/>Well overall, like I said, this movie is just average and forgettable. At the time of this review I'm sure it's out of most theaters but for the record I'll just say it wasn't worth a big screen viewing. <br/><br/>Honestly, as a Terminator fan, I found that the opening future war sequence of Terminator 2 was more satisfying than this whole movie."
"xamalek","9","2","4","20 June 2009"," Critics are too Harsh
","I would give this film 9 out of 10. The special effects would be 10/10 ... if someone can do better I need to meet them ... these are A for Effort effects.<br/><br/>This movie is not like a 1970s ""Planet of the Apes"" Sequel meltdown ... it is fluid and does not disrupt the continuity of the other movies. It was in fact Terminator 3 (which is my least favorite of the series), that caused a lot of disruption. This movies ties in nicely to Terminator and Terminator 2 very very well.<br/><br/>A few things need to be fleshed out: 1. The true nature of Cyberdyne before Judgement Day and the origin of Marcus Wright. Why is his programming (he is a cyborg) more subversive. What are the motives of Dr. Kogan - whose bidding is she doing? 2. How does Skynet know that Kyle Reese is John Connors father? Or even his importance? This is NOT a plot hole, but rather an unexplained issue. One could speculate that this could signal the return of Sarah Connor? I do not know.<br/><br/>The robots in this movie are overwhelming and the next movie should have EVEN more robotic rampage. Beyond that Marcus Wright was a very interesting introduction. It would be good to see the Cyborg Marcus again ... very very strong performance.<br/><br/>This was a solid movie ... better than Wolverine ... I still need to see Star Trek (I am behind) I heard that is the best of the summer so far."
"boyceluis","8","2","4","19 June 2009"," Can't Believe People Slate This Film!!!!!!!
","After I read all the reviews of this film I went expecting the worst. Why everybody thinks you can recreate T2 when Arnold is in his sixties astounds me. <br/><br/>I though the effects were some of the best I have seen, terminators looked amazing, Bale was a bit rubbish but Sam Worthington more than made up for it, and to be fair he had more screen time than Bale anyway.<br/><br/>After the awful T3 and boring Sarah Connor Chronicles this film really gets the terminator story back in the blockbuster category. Terminator fans will love this, although nerds may a bit upset that it is not exactly the same a the one minute flashbacks in the first two films. <br/><br/>So on the whole great action film with lots of terminators and explosions what more do you want."
"Zac-attack","9","2","4","17 June 2009"," SO much better than I expected! SO MUCH!!!
","So I took a look at some of the reviews people have given so far and i gotta say, they're much lower than i would have given the film...<br/><br/>Sure, the film doesn't have the same choking element that was signature and key to the first two films, BUT in all fairness, those films also relied on a sense of the unknown as characters in T1-3 where not from that the time frame of the war and didn't understand the technology, but it should have been apparent to anyone that knew this film was set DURING the war that everyone KNOWS whats going on, everyone is living in 2018 so why would the director want the sense of oncoming danger when one of the biggest problems with T3 is the fact the writers where getting lazy and simply recycling the script instead of allowing the series of films to progress, something T4 demonstrated quite well...<br/><br/>Now whilst i believe the Marcus Wright character should have had a longer ""WTF IS GOING ON"" period, he could never have been used to deliver the hard hitting tension of the first films so it's not a big deal.<br/><br/>Something i agree with Criticism-wise is the lack of night scenes and dark-sky shots that were evident in the Flash-Forwards we saw in the T1, 2 & 3 movies. But looking back at them now, you can see that these cut scenes are set much later, mostly after 2029 whereas this is set in 2018, so it's understandable that something may have occurred since then, or even that John Connor is stationed elsewhere later on in his life, but i can understand the use of bright sky used as the complex scenes would have been even harder to see with lack of vision, as there are few lights around outside... dunno if you noticed.<br/><br/>It was a very entertaining watch and for the first time since T2 i felt that that super computer at SkyNet, being one of the most advanced computers ever to be built, had a rational storyline other than just ""Lets send a single terminator to ensure the best leader of all time is never born"" ""He's at the exact age where he could run from us and show signs of intelligence, lets send another single terminator to get John Conner again, the best leader of all time"" ""John Conner's twenty now, and although even when he was younger, the tactics we used didn't work, we're gonna upgrade our robot and try the exact same method again, without back-up"" In this film the techniques used by the computer where very intelligent and also gave the films some wicked twists and turns. I absolutely loved it, it was FANTASTIC, not just for a film, but for a terminator film and don't let ANYONE tell you otherwise!!!!!!!!<br/><br/>-----SPOILERS VVVVVVV--------- <br/><br/>I loved the motorbike-terminators, the Arnie sequence where he just walks out of the room, FANTASTIC! Although the face being burned off was hardly surprising, but i did like the occasional subtle references for the old Terminator fans, things like feeding us the name of Reese before he's introduced to the new audience and even the, ""I'll be back"" was a lovely little reference to the other films, it almost restored my faith in Signature series quotes as my trip to see Star-Trek previously didn't result in me hearing ""It's Life Jim But Not As We Know It!"" a single time! Still a great movie though...<br/><br/>Overall, the film was amazing, the sheer noise of it deserved an Oscar as did the music which reflected this noise - which was by no means unnecessary as the machines are hardly gonna care about hurting people's ears - The loudness of the film also nicely held together the loud flash-forward sequences from the T1s to 3 and also added to the tension VERY well. <br/><br/>I can't express how great the film was, the best aspect being the extremely clever, detailed and well constructed plot, as a terminator fan, a MUST SEE!!!"

","Terminator:Salvation is a good film but it lacks a few things. First is Arnold Schwarzenegger who was great in the first three films (all you see is his face). The next thing it lacks is the R rating. But the movie has it's good things. The acting is pretty good, the effects are very good and the plot is good.As I said before I like the acting Christian Bale as Jhon Connor I give a thumbs up,Sam Worthington whom plays Terminator/Human Marcus Wright was also pretty good though he is Australian.The Effects are as good as they were in the other films.Idustrial Light & Magic creates great effects again.The plot is also great.Apparently this movie set after SkyNet becomes self-aware,2018.(Dont like Dr.Serena Kogen).I do like the films look of Post-apocalyptic Los Angles.So my review for this film is Positive despite what the film lacks it is as good a Terminator film as the last 3 films.PS: if you are a Terminator fan you will probably like this film."

","It is very simple: the action is a killer! An absolutely kick ass mind blowing roller-coaster action ride! 7 points for that. besides that, t4 has nothing more to offer. But what's the point in claiming this movie is bad? it has no plot (humans fight against machines, end of story), and unfortunately Bale didn't get rid of his Batman-voice which in some moments seems a little ridiculous. But never mind that, his screening time gets beaten by most of the supporting actors like Sam Worthington and Anton Yelchin anyway. Just switch off your brains and enjoy the action of the decade! This is my ninth line. So what? There's nothing else to say here. Okay, here we go. 10 lines. mission completed. U happy now?"

Overall, not a bad addition to the Terminator franchise; the usual explosions, chases, and carnage. A few surprises here and there, but the big ""surprise"" was telegraphed way in advance. What I believe sinks this movie as a success is the last ten minutes - and this may be why so many critics have pummeled this film. First of all, during the film we are told that a planned confrontation will be the end of Skynet. Yet, when the Skynet complex is destroyed, we are then told ""it is not over"" and the battle will continue. What? I don't like being lied to. Secondly, a prime plot line was tossed away: can humans and Terminators find a way to get along? When they kill the Humanator to give his heart to John Conner, the filmmakers were going for poignant but missed the mark, and wrecked what could have been a more interesting story for a possible sequel. The ending was just such an unnecessary downer!"
"siobhanmckibbin","9","2","4","14 June 2009"," Terminator Salvation - there is a future from the past
","Well if I'm being totally honest, whilst i was excited about the anticipated release of the latest T movies, i was also quite ambiguous in thinking that it would not be a true homage to the original Terminator. But gladly i was wrong. This film is not only what i consider an epic in the action movie world but also a true triumph in what could be the best Terminator ever made.<br/><br/>The graphics were stimulating and the sound effects were so effective they gave me a ringing in my ears as i left the cinema. But lets get down to business, whilst i throughly enjoyed the latest instalment in computers versus the world, i couldn't help myself from thinking that maybe i had seen it all before. At times it became a mixture of narratives and scenes from Transformers/Batman/War of the Worlds. And when Christian Bale's character John Connor rode off in a motorcycle it felt as if i was watching The Dark Knight.<br/><br/>Set in 2018,the film is set in the apocalyptic war, as John Connor is leading the resistance. But for once Connor is not the star. For me the focus shifted from Connor to Marcus, as this characters importance became known. Its Marcus's character that drives the narrative and gives the film more depth.<br/><br/>So not only are we presented with the familiar character of John Connor and the inevitable T-600, there is Marcus, a new breed of terminator. The most likable characteristic about Marcus (besides his looks) is not only has he the strength and power of the machines but he also has a heart. Whilst this may appear to be his weakness, his heart his the key in saving all of humanity and the resistance. Although the ending is predictable and maybe to some quite cheesy, it actually works. I feel that if John Connor's life was to end in the forth edition then i would of left feeling miserable instead of invigorated and wanting more like i did.<br/><br/>The highlight of Terminator Salvation for me was the reappearance of our ever favourite Terminator Arnie. It brought a smile to my face and i wasn't even bothered that it wasn't Arnie himself but a replica.<br/><br/>Overall Terminator Salvation is the most dramatic in these instalments but it does nothing but please both visually and emotionally. As a child i admired the originality and quality of the T films and as an adult i was witness to the aftermath of Judgement day."
"EchoMaRinE","7","2","4","12 June 2009"," Lets make a movie...
","I gave a 7 to this movie just because of the good CGI. There is definitely nothing else. You can guess the end from the beginning. They seem to use everything in the trailer. The story they are telling is something you can tell in 10 minutes. Anyways, this movie just buried the Terminator franchise which was killed by the third movie. It starts good but after the first action scene where I could count the number of hair and holes on the faces of all characters since the camera was used so so badly, I started to worry. There is not so much to criticize about the story since there was no story. But even in their non-existing plot there were so many ridiculous things. Yes, skynet can make these ultra advanced robots but can not listen simple radio communication. You can shoot anything with a rocket from 5 meters, the blast has no effect. When you jump into the ocean, there is always someone to pick you up and escort to a submarine. Meanwhile, you don't need any diving equipment or something like that if you are Christian Bale. The concept of John Connor is also totally destroyed after the third movie and the TSCC. He is supposed to be a leader not a prophet. It is quite clear that they made the movie just for money. If you have any respect to good old Terminator, don't watch this one and don't kill your good memories. I hope they will not be back..."

Clearly they have flying scouts which aren't easy to take out, surely their airfields and bases would've been scouted and vapourised by now? And also the huge stompy thing which clearly isn't easy to take down.<br/><br/>* finally- they are in SkyNet, they are mass-producing Terminators, yet only 2 bother to engage John/ Kyle, and none are bothering their transport outside.<br/><br/>I'd watch it again, but they missed an opportunity to make it more gritty and desperate, without everyone have ultra-white teeth and it not looking like mankind is struggling very much at all."
"PyTom83","8","2","4","11 June 2009"," Good sequel
","Maybe it's just because I went in with really low expectations after the crappy RT score and generally negative reactions, but I thought the movie was a lot of fun. Definitely surpassed my expectations.<br/><br/>The movie had decent action and it appears to mostly make sense (at least on a superficial level), but I really can't shake that dull feeling that nothing happened. Like ""why was this made? Why was Terminator brought back?"" This added nothing to anything, and it's such a disappointment because I think we all wanted to see Connor in the future making it right.<br/><br/>It did feel like it was building up to something that never happened. Now, that could (and probably is) be due to the ending re-write, but the movie we got felt like there was another reel to go before the credits hit.<br/><br/>But, after the mess that was T3, I was very happy with T4. The camera work/special effects were awesome.<br/><br/>Oh, and with the Arnold thing; for CG, it was great, but for looking like Arnold, I think he just looked way too young. I know it's from his 1984 model, but they could have added some lines to the face. It looked too clean, but I guess no computer technology right now can match up to reality."
"Aaron1375","7","2","4","11 June 2009"," For better and worse, Terminator is back.
","This movie was not quite as disappointing as I was expecting from all the mediocre reviews I read, but it was still my least favorite Terminator in the series. The plot was interesting and to much all at the same time. Christian Bale at times seemed to be the movies main focus, at others he almost disappeared into the background. Worthington though was good throughout as the mysterious Marcus. The Terminator robots looked good whenever they were on camera, but at times their presence in the movie needed extending too. All in all though it was a rather good job as it was a rather good action movie, just do not expect all that much humor in this one. Basically this one has Kyle Reese being targeted as well as Connor, always Connor. Well the robots get Reese and Marcus wants to rescue him, but he gets held up by Connor's group who find his secret. By far the best scene in this movie was the scene with the giant Terminator that started with a gas station being destroyed and then turned into one really nice chase scene. After this there are good action scenes, but nothing really compares to this extended chase scene. Arnold makes an appearance at the end sort of. You can tell it is somehow done with computers as it looks like Arnold from the first film. Basically good, but not as much of a thriller as the first Terminator, not as epic as Terminator II and not as fun a ride as Terminator 3."

","Terminator and T 2 are really great iconic films, with a cult status and rightly so. Just brilliant. T 3, as most people agree, missed the spot. So a new dawn has arose, and with it comes Terminator Salvation. If you ask most people what they most remember from the films, it's going to be Arnie as the Terminating Cyborg. He had that role (as his ""acting"" style) down to a T as a cold robotic machine who was trying to understand human beings - and we related to him, we actually felt something for his character. We cared. There's nothing like that in T4. The plot is nonsensical and if you analyse it, you'll find lots of plot holes. HOWEVER - this isn't the kind of film you go to analyse right? It's a big budget, all out, action sci-fi flick, with lots of big bangs, explosions and great big evil machines. Great special effects and cool robots. That's the point, right? Not as good as Terminator 1 and 2 but better than 3. So grab some popcorn and enjoy!"
"user-153","7","2","4","7 June 2009"," Fails to stand on the shoulders of giants: good but not great.
","I saw T:S last night and was saddened to find it as I anticipated: it was good, it was always going to be GOOD, but it wasn't great.<br/><br/>Define irony: The original Terminator film introduced a terrific new idea to sci-fi films and, under Cameron, did them brilliantly. The film The Matrix and TV series (the new one, not the original!) of Battlestar Gallatica took those ideas and developed them into new directions, expertly done with sometimes spectacular and thought-provoking story lines.<br/><br/>Then you have Terminator:Salvation, which treads the same path (particularly as B. S.) but doesn't do it quite as well. It has the mythology (as it were) of the original, but the result is, on a now well-trodden path, disappointing.<br/><br/>Why so? The casting was OK: Christian Bale maybe a little disappointing performing the kind of role he's now so familiar with, but Sam Worthington taking the plaudits with a brilliant emphatic and emotion-provoking performance (side note though - Helena Bonham Carter was dreadful and mis-cast - ol' forehead is a poor actress at the best of times, and Michael Ironside just too old to pull off a role which, again, is very familiar to him).<br/><br/>The problem I felt was in a clunky script ('I'll be back' indeed!) and a storyline the attempted to stand on the shoulders of those that post-dated the original film without ever accomplishing a new and/or compelling direction. That said, I did enjoy the frequent references to the preceding Terminator movies (of which there are many), perhaps despite myself.<br/><br/>Is the failure of this film (well, 'failure' is putting it a little high) ironic: have others taken the ideas of the original film and done them better than a film made after them all? I think so, which is a shame, albeit a predictable one."

","As a huge terminator fan I walked into the cinema knowing that this movie would be nowhere near as good as the first 2. However I was surprised as to how good this movie turned out, and here's why:<br/><br/>The acting in this movie was very well done, especially by Sam Worthington (Marcus) and Anton Welchin (Kyle) and I was willing them to destroy skynet throughout most of the movie. <br/><br/>McG also deliberately included probably 20 similarities between the other terminator movies (and I am not just referring to Christian bale's ""i'll be back""!). This was a good move for McG but only people who have watched the other movies more than once would pick up on all of these similarities.<br/><br/>There was a lot of rant and hype as to whether McG could actually deliver the amazing special effects that Cameron and Winston produced in Terminator 2. Honestly its nothing amazing however he still deserves a pat on the back for capturing the dark atmosphere and messiness of the war of the machines which Cameron gave us a glimpse of. <br/><br/>I gave this movie an 8 because the chase scenes (perhaps 2 or 3) was nothing spectacular and didn't have the same intensity as the first 2 terminators. Terminator 2 is widely considered to have some of the best action scenes in movie history and most of these include chase scenes, or maybe I just miss Arnie..<br/><br/>Overall its a very good action movie and is definitely worth watching in cinema but just don't expect it to be as good as Terminator 1 and 2!"
"thejablonsky","9","2","4","5 June 2009"," This is the answer for the question ""Why watch a movie in the cinema?"" Great Movie. Great Terminator.
","This is the first time I review a movie here. And the reason why I do so, is because I truly think that this movie is much better than the average (or most) of reviews that people are writing. Rating it as ""the worst movie ever"".<br/><br/>This movie in my opinion, until now, is the best scifi/action movie of this year. And it got real chances of being one of the best. It's that kind of movie that in the first two minutes is slow and then it's all about running, hiding, finding answers and pure action adrenalin. This movie carries well the name of Terminator in a much faster, wider way. It doesn't only follows John Connor. It follows Marcus and the reason of his existence. This Terminator uses great CGI rendering. I watched in a Digital cinema room and never for a second it came on my mind: ""That was badly done"". And I work in CGI/VFX. They spent a lot of effort (and money) on that, I assure you. The bleached filters and the color corrections used, work great with this genre of movie and it gives a nice Post-Judgment Day look. <br/><br/>Now about the plot. This is Terminator. Not Lord of The Rings or Star Wars. This is not a straight forward story and it brings a subject of many doubt and theories: Time Travel. So for this reason I think it's pretty obvious that many things are dubious and it's impossible to make it perfect and an easy plot because of the reason: ""What you change in the past, it reflects on the future."" So everything that both machines and resistance did on the first 3 movies may well changed the future that they are living now. And we can continue discussing this with billions of theories for every frame on every Terminator movie. And most important of all, this is cinema and it's ultimate objective is entertain in less than 3 hours. So if the T-800 doesn't kill in a second John Connor well maybe it's because he should live?! But then again, there are 3 Terminators that tried to kill him before and they didn't, why in hell a fourth would do it?! Rationalizing over things that are clear as water, is a mistake for any movie watcher. While doing that, yes, I believe going to the cinema is always a waste of money.<br/><br/>People make their mind early because of one Director or Writer reputation and curriculum. And not on the product. It's a shame. Because you've got a great movie here that you cannot appreciate.<br/><br/>And before finishing I would like to say that all the cast was good. I applaud Sam Worthington, it was the first time I saw him and it was a great surprise. I do hope that a fifth Terminator is coming using the same formula and answering some questions that were left opened.<br/><br/>Take care and watch this movie if you identify with what I said.<br/><br/>Very Good Movie. Not perfect. But yet again, what Terminator is? 9/10"

Well, I find myself as a real hard Terminator fan and I have to say I wasn't disappointed. Maybe it's because my hopes weren't as high after the third Terminator. To be honest, I was actually pleasantly surprised. And I even didn't let myself worried about this PG13 rating that they are now sticking on to every R-rated action film sequel.<br/><br/>Yes, Salvation stays far behind from the first two films but it is definitely as far ahead from the third one. I liked the story and the apocalyptic atmosphere. Though the CGI might not be as good. The T600 didn't look quite real metal. It didn't feel so threatening anymore.<br/><br/>Now the characters. I was pleasantly surprised by Sam Worthington, almost unknown actor who shadowed Christian Bale in my opinion. When Arnold Wchwarzenegger was a Terminator then Sam Worthington played Terminator. And did it very well. Even the accent didn't annoyed. Although the Christian Bale's John Connor didn't sympathized as much. Sam Worthington stole the whole show from him. To be honest, Terminators shadowed everybody in previous three movies.<br/><br/>Terminator Salvation is totally worth for seeing. Especially for a hardcore Terminator fan.<br/><br/>8/10"

","Terminator Salvation offers everything one could want from a film that promises continuous action and striking visual effects, except a viable plot. Director McG brings us the fourth installment of the popular Terminator series, in which Judgment Day has already occurred and the few survivors of earth have joined to form The Resistance against the machines. We see John Connor (Christian Bale) as the ever promised leader of The Resistance and Kyle Reese (Anton Yelchin) as a teenager fighting the machines in post-nuclear LA. The film revolves around Marcus Wright (Sam Worthington), an ambiguous criminal turned hero who signed away his body to Skynet before the war.<br/><br/>The audience is treated to the audio and visual effects of our time, which transform LA into a post-nuclear wasteland, invent terminators larger than we have ever imagined and bring the war to a new level. The audience is also subjected to an unrealistic (even for a Terminator film) storyline and, dare I say, too much actionnot to mention Christian Bale's constant guttural voice which sounds suspiciously like his Batman character.<br/><br/>In the end, the special effects of Terminator Salvation are not special enough to mask the vapid plot or to bring it up to par with its predecessors."

This movie was flat out entertaining, the camera angle left you in the middle of the action all movie long, and believe me there is plenty of action. You wont even want to get up to goto the bathroom or get a drink so do so before the movie. the movie is centered a post-apocalyptic waste land where the machines are trying to kill to extinct whats left of mankind. the resistance is led by John Conner(Christian Bale) who is a very distant character who seems to expect the worst in all situations. The movie itself may have the best special effects i have ever seen and the dark and serene setting that it takes place in really gets you into the move. my girlfriend had never watched any of the other terminator movies and she loved it.... i would recommend this movie to anyone and strongly suggest you go see it.... i gave this movie a 9/10 and at worst it should be an 8/10"

","The summer of my derivative, tired, clichéd, vapid, stale, lifeless, trite, hackneyed, threadbare, timeworn, bland, weak, flat, pedestrian, banal, dull, insipid, uninspired, repetitive movie continues apace and unabated with ""Terminator: Assisted Living Community"" <br/><br/>Ahnold is too busy helping push California into foreclosure and bankruptcy to be the main star, so it falls to Batman, Checkov, and Jester to save the world from the evil, twisted, marauding special effects.<br/><br/>I saw this movie at one of the midnight showing premieres, with a bunch of other hardcore Terminator fans. Christian Bale's ridiculous, menacing growl was so over the top hilarious that a good part of the audience was snickering or cracking up. Don't they have Hall's lozenges in the future? <br/><br/>Apparently, Terminators are also Transformers, on the theory that you should steal from your competitors before they can push their own joke movie into theaters. Which leads to speculation that Terminators may also be Turbo Rangers, Tamagotchis, and Tinkerbells, but that's another story.<br/><br/>This movie can't be bargained with. It can't be reasoned with. It doesn't feel pity, or remorse, or fear. And it absolutely will not stop, EVER, until you are dead. <br/><br/>You'll pray for someone to pull the plug on you."
"NickJ89","2","2","4","30 May 2009"," Possibly the best way to trash a great franchise
","This movie was horrendous. Watching previews and revisiting the trilogy over the past year or so has made me excited to see this, only to be let down extremely. TS was less than sub-par for a few reasons:<br/><br/>1. Marcus Wright - The character appears to be going somewhere, and appears to have a lot of depth. This is about all you'll ever know of him though. In some form of sick and twisted reverse-dramatic irony, the entire movie plays out without him once explaining to anyone in any way about his past. In one scene, he fixes a car and the radio turns on, blasting ""The Rooster"" by Alice in Chains. He shuts it off quickly and said ""my brother used to listen to that"". We as audience members sit and wait for some sort of flashback or something, but nothing! That's all you get, and he never brings it up again for the rest of the movie. Sadly, he is the most ""human"" character of the film. Everyone else is so fake. He seems to stay true to his personality.<br/><br/>2. One liners - The Terminator franchise NEEDS them, sure. I won't argue that. BUT, having Christian Bale say ""I'll be back"" when it didn't even make sense was stupid. I still have to say ""Come with me if you want to live"" is probably the best one liner of the franchise, and it wasn't disappointing to hear it here. I feel like the placement could've been better, but I was actually expecting that one.<br/><br/>3. John Connor - I totally didn't expect to see God in this film, but here he is. John Connor not only doesn't have any personality, but he's also invincible. Everything goes right for him at every moment. He manages to survive every situation, and climbs to the top ranks of ""The Resistance"" in about 15 minutes real-time, from the moment he jumps from a helicopter and enters a submarine that he doesn't know the location of (yeah, I don't know how that one worked either).<br/><br/>4. Characters - This movie introduces probably about 12 to 13 characters who could potentially star in their own movie, but doesn't develop a single one. Kyle Reece, Marcus Wright, John Connor, that weird old lady at the 7/11, Helena Bonham Carter's cancer patient character, all of them. I just saw this movie a few hours ago, and I could not tell you one significant thing about any of them, except for the fact that Christian Bale shouldn't have played John Connor.<br/><br/>This movie is a disgrace to the previous three films. even T3 was better than this crap. It's probably the top of my list for worst movies I've seen this summer, right above Night at the Museum. That should be a good indicator of how much this movie sucks."
"harry_tk_yung","Null","2","4","29 May 2009"," Connor begins at back-to-the-future
","I'll start with a quick comparison to the Alien series. The obvious similarity is that both start as a horror movies and becomes a war movie at some stage. With Alien, it was right at the sequel, Aliens (with an ""s"", that is), which by the way is one of the best war movies ever made. For Terminator, it has taken until no. 4, i.e. this one, to trot down this path.<br/><br/>A more relevant comparison is of course with the three Terminators that went before, and the evolution is interesting to observe. No. 1 pitches the Terminator (good old Arnie) against Sarah Connor (inimitable Linda Hamilton), before the birth of John Conner, with the father-from-the-future Kyle Reese played by Michael Biehn. No. 2 is an all-Sarah show, with Arnie turned friendly and a new deadly enemy – mercury-fluid T-1000 (Robert Patrick). John Connor, as an early adolescent here, is played by Edward Furlong. No. 3 is finally the story of John Connor, played impressively by Nick Stahl. Sarah, now dead, is sorely missed, but her savage (in a complimentary sense) courage is proffered in Kate Brewster, John's girlfriend played by a delightful Claire Danes. Arnie continues to be friendly while the new deadly machine finally takes a female form, as alluring but lethal T-X (Kristanna Loken). The above cover ""what went on before"".<br/><br/>Surprising as it may sound, when it's finally ""back to the future"", with Christian Bale playing John Connor, it is somebody else's story. You have to give credit to Bale for willingness to take up this support role (albeit so significant a support that you can call it a co-lead). Maybe there is a good reason. John Connor here has not yet achieved the prominent position of the global leader of the war against the machines. The movie makers may be saving it for future sequences. <br/><br/>The new story is good. The new character Marcus Wright, capably played by professionally trained Australian actor Sam Worthington, is a convicted murderer who agrees to donate his body after execution for good purposes. What he ends up becoming is a terminator in a different guise, programmed to kill Connor. As expected, you have the good-human-nature-prevailing scenario. Bryce Dallas Howard, who has shown promises as M. Night Shyamalan favourite actress, is all but wasted here playing Kate Brewster, now married as Kate Connor. The fearless-female element of Hamilton and Danes is now assigned to Moon Bloodgood playing resistance fighter Blair Williams who, in a brief romance, recognizes Marcus goodness. Young Kyle Reese, who must be kept alive to be sent back to the past (no. 1) to father Connor, is played by Anton Yelchin. (No, the knowing Connor did not say ""hi dad"" when he met this young man). As to other continuity, there is Linda Hamilton's recorded voice in messages to Connor and a brief replica of Arnie's face before the thing turns into a metal skeletal form. Helena Bonham Carter's appearance is only cameo.<br/><br/>This movie is well-made. Technical quality is evident right from the first brief action scene, with visually stimulating shots covering a good variety of fast-moving objects from various angles. The story is told in an interesting way, with the threads converging at around mid-point, when things start to fit together. All told, there are good credentials justifying continuing the franchise."
"flapjack-mullet","9","2","4","27 May 2009"," Shockingly Good
","While the original 2 movies will forever be classics, this film shines in its own right. Elfman's score is surprisingly fitting, given that he is known more for his contributions to comedy films as well as his numerous Tim Burton works. Christian Bale makes the perfect John Connor, much better than anything I had hoped for out of this film. The problem with the audience's general mindset about this movie is that people are trying to compare it to the original 2 films(I don't consider the 3rd Terminator worthy of comparison here). The truth and beauty about this movie is that it is so vastly different in both plot structure and character development that it is able to stand alone in relation to the original Terminator films. This movie augments the epic story-telling power of the original 2 films, and allows viewers insight into the life of John Connor that finally sates the cinematic thirst of the audience and answers burning questions about the origin of the man-vs.-machine war."
"TheEtherWalk","8","2","4","27 May 2009"," I liked it a lot
","I'll keep this short. This movie had a great story, great action and was really well made. Sam Worthington really does a great job, even in the scene where he looks at the sky, puts his hands up and screams. That's how you do it, Gavin Hood. My only real complaint is that this movie didn't show much of the overall conflict between machines and humans, and hopefully the next one will be bloodier. Some parts of the plot seem slightly implausible as well, but this is offset by surprisingly good dialog. The action is all great looking, realistic and works seamlessly into the story. This isn't up to the level of the Batman reboots, but it's a very enjoyable movie."
"howells-2","9","2","4","26 May 2009"," Wondering if negative reviewers enjoy good movies
","I remember Terminator as a kid and watching Arnold's terminator repairing his eye in the hotel room and thinking COOL! We'll I'm far from a kid now and I still love movies...good movies. That's what this one is...it's a good movie...period. I am one of those who actually liked T3 and can't really understand why some don't. I watched all three other movies again shortly before going to see this one (T3 just hours before).<br/><br/>I was really worried when I heard McG was doing this one. OH Charlie's Angels 2....so I was hesitant to even get excited. I dodged the trailers for a long time and shrugged this one off. At the last minute I decided to have a family outing to go see a movie over the weekend and so I went. I WAS NOT Disappointed. I always longed for more action in the future with the machines when I got glimpses of it in the other 3 and I have to say there were several spots in the movie I went ""WOW"" out loud.<br/><br/>The action was great and it was a great blend of CGI and real effects. CGI is so overused in some of today's movies; it has its place of course. It was perfect in this one. The director did a fantastic job of creating a bleak war zone that gave impending doom that the other movies set up so well for us and each machine just added to that.<br/><br/>By the way there is a story as well. A very heartfelt and very thought out one if you pay attention. It's not all mindless action, granted there is lots of action to be seen. Your senses are bombarded at times which is what we all want right, but it's the story here that pulls you in, and it's surprisingly not all about John Connor, or is it.? Is it the same as the others, absolutely not is it supposed to be absolutely not. This is not the ""lets go back in time to kill John Connor"" movies we lovebeen there and done that three times already. It is a great war moviea war between the humans struggling to survive and a seemingly superior adversary who just keeps on finding ways, very intelligent ones, to deceive, survive, and dominate.<br/><br/>You can listen to the naysayers all you want but if you like good movies; you owe it to yourself to give this one a shot. It's a really great movie that pays homage and refers back to its predecessors in a respectable way while all the while improving upon those principles and ideas already in place."
"Mr_Censored","7","2","4","26 May 2009"," A flawed yet worthy entry in the ""Terminator"" franchise
","When the news first broke that a fourth ""Terminator"" movie was in the works and that none other than ""Charlie's Angels"" director McG would be at the helm, the fan-boy world let out a collective groan. It helped matters that Christian Bale signed on to play the savior of the human race, John Connor, but for the most part, ""Terminator Salvation"" had an up-hill battle to fight. Here we are with the fourth installment in a franchise that many doubt should have gone past James Cameron's masterpiece, ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day,"" in the first place. This is the third director to tackle the material, with a script penned by the same guys who delivered the poorly received ""Terminator 3: Rise Of The Machines"" (not to mention ""Catwoman."" Yikes!). To make matters even more complicated, the script has been re-heated and doctored by Jonathan Nolan (""The Dark Knight"") to make the role of John Connor bigger than in the original script. All of this, while being made within the constraints of a PG-13 rating (a first for the series) and a toy-company to pacify. With so many cooks in the kitchen, so many expectations to meet and so many watching and judging, it's quite amazing, then, that is turned out as well as it did.<br/><br/>""Terminator Salvation"" begins with Marcus (Sam Worthington), a man on death row for killing his brother, among others. Coerced by a cancer-ridden lover, Serena (Helena Bonham-Carter), he signs off on letting his soon-to-be-dead body be used for scientific experiments and advancements. We watch him receive only the best capital punishment that Texas can afford, only to find himself resurrected in a post-apocalyptic wasteland, circa 2018. The Judgment Day that Sarah Connor warned about has devastated mankind, as they fight for survival against Skynet and the machines who see them as the enemy and seek to eliminate them. The self-fulfilling prophet, John Connor (Bale) has yet to take his rightful place, though. There are those who believe in him, and those in power (Michael Ironside) who don't. When his future (or his past) is put into question – his future father, a teenage Kyle Reese (Anton Yelchin), is captured and on his way to termination – he must work together with a man – or a machine – whom he was raised not to trust.<br/><br/>If the story sounds incomplete, or that it's missing something, then you aren't alone. The biggest problem facing this film is its script. Maybe it worked better in its original form, but by making more room for the character of John Connor, it starts to bloat and loses its impact. It doesn't help that the film is short, clocking in at well under two hours, and doesn't allow enough time to flesh out its plot-points. For example, you'll notice Connor's wife (Bryce Dallas-Howard, replacing Claire Danes) is visibly pregnant, and yet, nothing is ever mentioned about it in the film. The character of Marcus Wright is an intriguing and original addition to the ""Terminator"" mythos, played perfectly and convincingly by Worthington. While this part of the story is fleshed out well-enough, it's often put on the sidelines to make screen-time for Bale/John Connor. While you couldn't ask for a better adult John Connor than Christian Bale, there's simply not enough for him to do in this film, other than to give inspiring speeches to his comrades or go hand-to-hand combat with the machines. He makes an imposing and impressive Connor, giving the expected intensity and presence, but the character is barely expanded upon what was already given to us in the first two films. In short, if you're a newcomer watching this flick, you're not likely to be convinced that this man is all that important to the future of mankind and maybe – just maybe – he's got an overblown ego, and a temper to boot.<br/><br/>On the upside of things, director McG deserves a round of applause. Not only did he take fan-boy criticisms in stride throughout the creation of the film, but on his end – the direction – he succeeds on virtually all fronts. While the story is weak and flawed, the visual aspect of the film is stunning. Full-on, from the moment we are re-introduced to the John Connor character, you believe that what you are seeing is a post-Judgment day world. One key moment early in the film finds Connor's allies annihilated by a bomb, covering the area in a sea of smoke and a rain-storm of ash. It's a far-cry from the brief war scenes we were given in the previous ""Terminator"" films, and in this particular scene, inspiration seems to have been drawn from Steven Spielberg's World War II epic, ""Saving Private Ryan."" Obviously, this is a fictional war, and not as dense as the real-life tragedy Spielberg portrayed in his film, but visually, McG nails it. Another spot where the film shines are in its special effects. True to the late-Stan Winston's method, most of the effects are achieved practically, rather than relying too heavily on CGI. The Terminators in the film look not only mean and heartless, but real. Heck, we even get Arnold Schwarzenegger's face rendered to Roland Kickinger's body, to re-create the famous T-800, and it's hard to tell the difference between real and fake. All of this, of course, on top of one outrageous action sequence after another and nods to previous films galore. You'll see motorcycles chasing tractor-trailer trucks in an interesting role reversal, and you'll watch as John Connor sets traps to the tune of Guns N' Roses ""You Could Be Mine."" All of these elements help seal the deal, making it feel like an authentic ""Terminator"" sequel and less of a cash-in (which, for the most part, it is). In the end, despite being light on plot and character development, ""Terminator: Salvation"" packs enough of a punch to be considered a worthy entry in the franchise and a brilliant summer blockbuster to boot."

","This comment is meant to replace another user who rated this film a ""one star."" I know people are entitled to their own opinion, but this film deserves a chance.<br/><br/>Personally, I thought this movie was very enjoyable. The plot is slightly predictable, but who really cares in an action movie. Many of the people who loved the terminator series know the story by heart, but continue to watch them again and again to immerse themselves in a world where humans struggle against their own mechanical creations.<br/><br/>The actors were good in the sense that I never once had a problem with the acting. This is important to really get into the story, and not just feel like you're watching a movie.<br/><br/>The effects alone are worth watching! Nowadays too many movies are using CGI to replace real explosions and models. This might have worked for Toy Story, but not what you want in an action movie where you want the robots and explosions to look authentic. This movie does not disappoint. Most of the machines were painstaking built and blow up the good o' fashion way. Only once near the end of the movie did I notice bad CGI - which is forgivable as it wasn't a crucial part of the film.<br/><br/>All in all, give it a chance. Go see it if you're looking to be entertained for two hours. You definitely will not leave disappointed."
"teck4201","6","2","4","25 May 2009"," Decent movie disguised in the terminator franchise
","Let's just put it out there that there are allot of expectations that all fans want when they make another installment to a blockbuster hit like Terminator but considering how awful the third installment was in the franchise I was even more skeptical with this one. Like all good movies, there are so many things that need to be done right to make them good as they are. After that, it's very difficult to reinvent it when so many people may already consider it as perfect, so knowing that, I decided to go ahead and see the Terminator Salvation restraining myself from doing what we all tend do when watching another installment ""The comparison"".<br/><br/>The story itself wasn't unique at all since they had to set the story based on what the terminator story was about in the first place, the war of ""humans versus machines"" but the movie itself wasn't that all engaging to begin with. If they took out all the elements that ties it in with the first three movies then I personally believed that I would have lost more of an interest if it wasn't for the special FX and action scenes.<br/><br/>The first half of the movie was pretty descent but as you get deeper into the story you realize that the characters really didn't do a good job complimenting each other in their rolls. Everyone was angry and only had one thing in mind, killing the machines. This is when I realized the reasoning for the wanna-be-human-hybrid machine character. The humans were one dimensional and they needed someone with more personality to make the human race, well, more humane. They even tried to cover that up by putting in the line where John Conner was trying to tell everyone by saying ""..we shouldn't be like the machines."" Even with this emotional hybrid character, it still wasn't enough for me to get past the silly logic as well as plot holes that was being placed in the story.<br/><br/>One was the question on where did the machines get the information of John Conner's fathers identity? <br/><br/>Second would be, if they knew they had captured him in the first place then wouldn't it be a good idea to kill him thus eliminating the past birth of John Conner? <br/><br/>If the humans were so scared of infiltrating SkyNet then why was it so easy for one man to go in and destroy everything even with the help of one rogue hybrid robot.<br/><br/>If Skynet developed this Hybrid robot and they put that chip on the back of his head to control him then why was it necessary for them to explain everything to him at the end of the movie and give him a chance to live if he was just disposable in the first place?<br/><br/>Not least but why was Common wearing sun glasses in the middle of the night where he's smack in the middle of enemy territory where they can possibly shoot him down from anywhere?<br/><br/>Besides that there are certain parts where you can tell they borrowed ideas from the first 2 movies and who didn't see it coming when John Conner was going to die since his heart was bad and he needed saving? <br/><br/>The only thing I really did like was the FX especially the action scene with the terminator motorcycles but that was about it. <br/><br/>The movie will not rate up to the first 2 and I give it a score of 6 only because I'm ""comparing"" it to how bad 3 was."
"burbs82","9","2","4","25 May 2009"," Excellent and faithful entry into the Terminator saga...
","If the first two Terminator flicks are 10's, and being generous, we'll say Part 3 was a 5, this is definitely back to the well-written, well-paced footing of the first two films. I have to admit, I was dubious about this film, but I was proved wrong from start to finish.<br/><br/>The story is solid, not striking one as being somewhat unnecessary like the third film. After surviving humanity's nuclear holocaust at the hands of a self-aware military defense computer network, Skynet, It's now 2018, John Connor is part of the human resistance and he discovers that Skynet has targetted a young Kyle Reese, his future father, for termination and is desperately seeking him out just as the resistance has discovered an incredible breakthrough in their offensive effort against Skynet.<br/><br/>However, as always, Skynet has a new cyborg up their sleeves and this one is remarkably inventive. It's all part of a plan to ensnare the man who remains Skynet's greatest threat; John Connor. It's also an interesting reversal of the premise of the first two films. A death row inmate, Marcus, donates his body to science and awakens in the future, unaware that he is now a pawn in Skynet's calculated plan to draw out the young Kyle Reese, who along with his young, mute friend Star, essentially take on the sympathetic target roles of Linda Hamilton in the original, and Edward Furlong from Part 2, and are the real heart and moral fiber of the film, and it as an older, war-weary John Connor, and an unwitting cyborg looking for redemption, who must save Reese in order to save Connor and the future of humanity.<br/><br/>All in all, a great film. Marcus and Connor share the protagonist role, and since the Marcus character is new, but has an interesting background, he brings an interesting and refreshing narrative to the saga, and Sam Worthington does a great job with the character. In my opinion, Anton Yelchin actually steals the show, because the kid not only looks A lot like Michael Beihn, but he acts just like him too, and I have to admit, the original has always been (and remains) my favorite. Some really standout moments are nods to the previous films, specifically the Schwarzenegger T-800 model CGI'd in was an AWESOME touch. He even has the combover hair from the original. If only Connor could have offered up a hearty ""Nice night for a walk, eh?""... Also, listen for the Guns 'N Roses track 'You Could Be Mine', from Terminator 2. Several memorable quotes referenced as well, this is essentially the continuing, and clever theme of the past influencing the future that dominated the second film.<br/><br/>My only VERY MINOR critique would be the score, which compared to the first two films is kind of bland. The trademark Brad Feidel drum beat plays briefly at the beginning and end, but that's all. Usually I complain if a film overuses CGI, which this one does perhaps a bit, but the CGI itself is solid, for the most part. Still, this one's a winner. Fans should definitely check it out."

","Another summer blockbuster is upon us with McG's Terminator Salvation. A prequel set in the future to the Terminator series. To those familiar with the Terminator story, the film takes place in 2018, years after the military computer system called Skynet has become self aware. Having deemed humans a threat and in what humans call Judgement Day, Skynet launches a nuclear assault wiping out most of mankind. The rest are hunted by machines called Terminators. However, there is hope for mankind in the form of the legendary resistance fighter, John Connor(Christian Bale). The film centers around the resistance to the machines. Connor is tasked with finding a teenage Kyle Reese (Anton Yelchin, who is our hero from the first Terminator who, as you recall, traveled back in time to save John's mother Sarah Connor) who, like Connor is targeted for execution. Into the mix is a mysterious ""man"" called Marcus, who in 2003 was executed but donated his body to Cyberdyne Systems (and for those Terminator fanboys and girls, we know who Cyberdyne is) and resurfaces after 15 years. But is he friend or foe? It is a race against time for the resistance against the dreaded machines.<br/><br/>Now, I'm a huge fan of the Terminator series, except for the terrible TV show. I had always been curious about what a film would be like that explored the time of John Connor taking on the machines in the future. However, I was skeptical when I heard McG would be the one to show us this future. But, he does a pretty decent job. The action is really good and the effects are fantastic. The first half of the film is exciting and keeps your interest. Unfortunately, it cannot sustain itself as holes in the plot become apparent and there is suspension of disbelief that is just too unbelievable to the point of laughable. There are some clever references to the previous Terminator films and a very special surprise in store. You will recognize the catch phrases, although one made famous by Arnold Schwarzenegger is force fed into the dialogue that it is just too contrived.<br/><br/>As for the acting, a lot has been made of Christian Bale's meltdown on the set that became viral several months ago and I for one have been very critical of Mr. Bale for doing that. But, he does a good job as John Connor. He did not play him with any Hollywood swagger, but a believable soldier who is in a very tough spot, he is reminiscent of the way Michael Biehn portrayed Reese in the first Terminator. All business. But, Bale does it with more finesse and frankly is a better actor. He was living out his imaginary circumstance with truthfulness and is effective. Anton Yelchin, (certainly has a good agent, getting the job as Reese and also portraying Chekov in Star Trek) does an adequate job as Reese but is fairly forgettable. Sam Worthington as Marcus is a worthy partner for Bale and they seemed to play off each other fairly well. Rounding out the cast are veterans, Helena Bonham Carter and Michael Ironside who also do a good job in their respective limited roles."
"mike872","7","2","4","25 May 2009"," From a Ravaged Hollywood, Humanity Challenges San Francisco Terminators
","Christian Bale stars as John Connors, trying to find his not yet mature father in 2018 after arriving there from the distant future, to see to it that Dad will live through the ten year earth takeover by the terminators, so that he will live to meet his mother, and as Richard Nixon said in Frost-Nixon, 'fornicate' with her, to conceive Connors, so he can save the earth from destruction in 2018! Are you following this?<br/><br/>Its all bang bang every 2 minutes but hardly anyone ever gets killed because the film moguls don't want to lose actors they've paid exorbitant fees for performance. Even the mute little black girl who does little but stand around and occasionally find absolutely essential stuff to save their a**es., even she never gets killed. There's a serial killer from 2008, Marcus Wright (Sam Worthington) a challenger to John Connors. Wright traded his death sentence to be chemically changed instead, into a template body for revival at some distant moment in the future. Sam Worthington steals the movie from Bale, just as the Joker stole it from Bale in the Dark Knight a year ago. Late in the movie, we find that he has been revived as one of the terminators, so that now he has to fight his dark side to regain lost human qualities to inevitably side with the freedom fighters. He and Connors fight some mean-spirited battles before Connors is sure Wright has heart enough to be trusted. Oh the Humanity!<br/><br/>Before its known that the revived Worthington is a good guy, we watch him tear up the ruined territory around a Hollywood already brought low by nearly 100 years of steady, ravaging, humanity draining film-making and exploitation, now reduced to a tattered Hollywood sign and something like the ruined landscape of Mad Max imposed on Century City and the La Brea Tar Pits. Marcus Wright is a whiz at reviving retro engines from old Honda Isuzos, VW Yugos and Toyotas blackened from destruction by the Terminators, using abandoned, pre-digital, analog electronics technique. Wright summons intuitive knowledge about this gear from old memory banks. He can hot wire an old wreck in a Hollywood minute with just a paper clip, a baby aspirin and a rubber band. Connors listens to an ancient cassette tape of his mother explaining where his (in 2018) father who is still just 19 now, IS, on a retro radio shack cassette player/recorder like one I have on my computer desk. The saviors of the planet are stuck with analog stuff to try and take back the night from the Terminators.<br/><br/>In other words, the Terminators occupy the high intellectual ground and high tech terrain at their Fortress in San Francisco/Silicon Valley suspiciously near George Lucas' Special Effects ranch , while the undermanned and low tech retro forces of humanity are stuck with gear that predates the first cellphones in a bag and the first Atari home computers, in a Hollywood short on geeks. In order to communicate with the small groups of human freedom fighters still alive around the planet, Connors fires up the XERB AM Mexican Radio transmitter Wolfman Jack once broadcast his show on. In remote enclaves around the country, small groups of humans listen to transistor radios like the one Joe Buck schlepped to Manhattan in Midnight Cowboy (1969) to meet with Ratso Ritso. The Humans are reduced to using the remnants of a toy-like Atari computer from the seventies to invent a radio frequency that substitutes an oscilloscope-like radio pattern that undoes and disables the demonic digital algorithms of the terrorists of San Francisco.<br/><br/>Marcus Wright isn't certain he's human or terminator, but gradually, after many showdowns with Connors, including one in which the carnage of the Vietnam War, including napalmed villages and ravaged Huey Helicopters invoked for the battle, bring the two closer to one another. Now Wright is totally devoted to Connors. Toward the end, voice tracks from the Linda Hamilton character of the second Terminator are introduced along with stills of her from Terminator 2. Meanwhile, in Sacramento, a vexed Arnold, faced with a $12 Billion budgetary shortfall, is diverted from seeking new taxes, when he learns the Moguls have screwed him out of another $20 million screen payday, by using holograms made from from his three earlier Terminator performances instead of him, to fight the final screen battles with Marcus Wright. Arnold doesn't get a dime for this picture! Where's the humanity in that?<br/><br/>Comes the Dawn, which is hard to see because the film's cinematography is as bleak and dark as the taupe and brown rustic colors Al Gore was advised to wear for the 2000 Presidential campaign. The unforgiving OD look renders this production a forbidding context in contrast to Terminators 2 and 3. Both Wright and Connors are still alive, revived and racing away the victors over the terminators. But in Sacramento, Arnold, still short on tax revenues, is begging Obama for a bail-out!"
"ona6","9","2","4","25 May 2009"," My Perspective...
","I have been anticipating this movie for a long-time (almost since the first preproduction time). Then, the trailer hit the theaters and finally the movie opened just this week. I bought my ticket and watched Terminator Salvation on 05/21/09. <br/><br/>Last few days, because I have been a huge terminator fan, I have been checking out the reviews about Terminator Salvation over the net to get a feel. I must say that I have been shocked about some of the reviews that basically stoned to movie. I don't know how many of you ever noticed what I am about to say but a new trend popped out: not liking certain movies for no good reason became somehow ""in"". As a result, I witnessed the crucification of certain movies. It almost seemed like movie-goers are programmed NOT to see or even boycott the movies. The way I see it, movies are condemned because either they are not properly made or they are not well- analyzed/understood. I started to believe that TS falls in latter category. Having said I am a big fan of terminator franchise, I decided to ink this review not to rate but to comment on it fairly..<br/><br/>The first point concerning TS that worths emphasis is that it is not planned as a single movie but first of few others to come, in stead (if you go ahead and check the IMDb page for McG, you will see Terminator 5 ""in development"" stage). Why am I saying this? if you watch TS unaware of this revelation, TS seems like a single incomplete movie, inherently causing some of bad reviews. The mission of this movie was simply bridge the previous ""trilogy"" to upcoming one. This is why we just see some part of story as a result of which certain events are left to be seen for the future. All we saw is the beginning of the end. All we saw was how John Connor began putting pieces together. This is why we don't see an army of Arnold-like terminators because sky-net just began copying the human tissue. We don't see John Connor as a big soldier (the way he has been portrayed in 3 movies) but just a struggling soldier. And more importantly, we don't see huge victory against the machine but just a battle won. So, please be patient..<br/><br/>Let's say that McG decided to follow the footsteps of the idea of sending a terminator to kill John Connor. Don't you think that we have seen enough times? So why to do over? Like in the Saw movies, how many times we have seen some people being trapped and wound up punished for something they did or they didn't? 5, 6 times by now? How many of you are looking forward to new Saw movies wherein the story barely proceeds and just goes around the circle? Thank god, McG did not go down that road. Here, we catch the next step. We see actually the ultimate battle between Skynet and mankind. Don't you think this is better watching the same John Connor-terminator dance for the 4th time? if you ask me, it is...<br/><br/>It may also seem like this movie spare less screen time on John Connor as if he happens to be the forgotten one, in stead of being one. This is because now there are more characters involved and their story becomes as important as John. If you take the first terminator, how many character had significance in the story-line besides Sarah Connor? the same for the second movie. But in the 4th movie, we have a new Marcus character (who has a secret agenda), we see Kate Connor as pregnant woman (a review in the internet says that the baby will play a crucial role in the future) and long-time coming Kyle Reeves, to name few. These characters and their developments are as important as John Connor's as seen here and will be seen in the following movies. Fortunately, McG grafts the new-comers into the movie beautifully in proper dosages. <br/><br/>More importantly, I believe that McG did a great job and we are presented the 4th movie exactly the way it is destined, needed to be. I must also say I was amazed how much this installment respected the previous ones, like the use of Guns 'n Roses song - You could be mine, universally known lines (""I'll be back"" or ""come with me if you wanna live"") and the surprise cameo which blew me away. If you are fanatic of this franchise, you can even see how Connor got the scare in his face (look at him T2 in the scene before the opening credits), as a totally unimportant and minor detail. But to me, this shows a firm evidence of how McG took this project seriously to complement the other movies and even respect them.<br/><br/>Enough said. Just don't pay attention to bad critics floating over the net. If you are not a big fan of terminator, it would be safe to assume that you would been exhausted by now anyway and the odds are that TS won't be so appealing to you. But if you are a fan - like me, you'll appreciate the movie big time..<br/><br/>9/10<br/><br/>PS: As I was enjoying reading a heated discussion over time-traveling and time-loop in terminator movies, I came across a note that virtually claims ""people taking this movie this seriously should see a doctor"". Like (s)he says, let's altogether cease discussing movies. What's next? stop discussing poetry? music? Then, why are we still beating the bushes to unreveal the meaning behind Mona Lisa? Isn't it just a picture of a woman? As far as I am concerned, the movies are art and without art, we wouldn't be much different from these terminators. Just an opinion.."

","i cant help but think that this movie isn't bad like most. most movies r bad because there was something wrong with the script or the casting or the direction.

"j_jefferson55","8","2","4","23 May 2009"," Post-Apocalyptic Hit
","This film does the Terimantor series justice. We are introduced to new and dynamic characters that round out the cast, making Salvation more interesting and dramatic, much more than just some futuristic shoot 'em up. Since the director and writers of Salvation are new to the series, you can expect certain diversions and add-ons here that may annoy die-hard fans.<br/><br/>The movie is set so that a person who has never seen the other three can enjoy it (but to have a complete understanding, it's necessary to see the other movies). The script is well-written, especially for the character Marcus Wright; he's mysterious and conflicted, with a past we never fully understand. All in all, Salvation is an action-packed, well-written movie that all Terminator fanatics must see. The special effects are solid, and the acting, especially Sam Worthington's performance, makes the movie well-worth watching."
"Apologetickid","7","2","4","21 May 2009"," Good action movie. Not up to the ""Terminator"" standard.
","OK, So T2 is my favorite movie of all time, so naturally I was excited to see that a fourth installment was being delivered. The trailer was enough to get me Fandangoing my tickets. And that is just about as far as my delight got. Here's the thing: the movie isn't bad...as an action movie. But the Terminator franchise goes beyond ""action movie"". The Terminator story is sci-fi gold. It's almost as if the writers didn't fully appreciate the mythology of the Terminator series. As far as the film itself goes, the visual effects are well done, and the acting/directing isn't horrible. But the story lacks the mental ""kick-in-the-balls"" that came along with the other Terminators. So much more could have been done with the relationship between John Connor and Kyle Reese. The writers really missed an opportunity to develop a strangely sentimental father/son relationship. I am reluctant to give this movie anything more than 6 stars, but because it is now part of the Terminator canon, I'll throw an extra star in there. See this movie, but don't expect the ground-breaking visuals or mind-bending sci-fi that were present in the previous installments."
"MrGKB","7","2","4","21 May 2009"," As good as one might expect from the director of ""Charlie's Angels,""...
","...Joseph ""McG"" Nichols' entry into the Terminator franchise is a fairly relentless action flick that best serves to establish the apocalyptic firmament of 2018, and set the stage for whatever sequels are intended to move our heroes, John Connor and Kyle Reese, toward their inevitable destinies. To bring things full circle, so to speak, which is, unfortunately, perhaps the fatal weakness in an otherwise mildly serviceable screenplay by co-writers John D. Brancato & Michael Ferris, who brought us ""Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines"" lo, these several years ago. As is the case with all serial stories, and especially those involving time travel and its attendant paradoxes, when you start filling in gaps in an over-arching storyline, you lose a certain amount of dramatic tension, since you know how certain things must turn out in order to maintain the integrity of the story. In ""TS,"" we *know* that John Connor will not die until he hooks up with Kyle Reese. We know Kyle Reese will not die until he goes back into the past to sire John Connor. On the plus side, we also know we're going to encounter one bad-to-the-bone T-800 before the credits roll.<br/><br/>There's plenty of astonishing eye candy along the way, courtesy of ILM and a host of other sfx companies, some at times astounding camera-work by Shane ""Into the Blue"" Hurlbut and Michael ""this is my first big one!"" Fitzgerald--check out the helicopter sequence with Connor's crash landing, wow!--and overall production values reflecting a multi-hundred-million dollar motion picture. Danny ""Oingo-Boingo"" Elfman delivers a score that meshes well with the kinetic mayhem on screen, and two accomplished leads of variable notoriety, Christian ""The Dark Knight"" Bale and Sam ""Avatar"" Worthington, head up an ensemble of human resistance fighters battling them nasty machines to ever-lovin' death. Willing suspension of disbelief is, of course, absolutely required to assuage lingering questions like ""Where do humans get their food and fuel?"" and ""Where are all the maintenance robots?,"" but things move along at such a steady clip that you don't have much time to consider such brain teasers. Besides, you should have already checked your brain at the entrance to the cinema.<br/><br/>""Terminator Salvation"" will never attain the iconic status of the first two films in the franchise, but it manages to hold its own with the unfortunate ""T3:RotM,"" and opens the door to further storytelling. Only time, the box office, and Mr. Bale's temper will tell.<br/><br/>As a Memorial Day weekend wannabe-blockbuster, ""Terminator Salvation"" may not have any brains, but it's got a strong heart. Purists will be distraught, while action junkies will just suck up the bang-bang."

","HBCU247.com writes I should first say, I can't believe this movie is rated PG-13 because from what I saw it looks to be a little on the R-rated sidebut that's just me. This movie is a fresher, hipper installment to the Terminator series with its Ducati-bots, sexier – deadlier T-series (which could be either good or bad), amazing cinematography and graphics, and terrific actors like Christian Bale who made a very convincing Resistance man. Plus, who doesn't like a little eye candy in their movie (I'm referring to Australian-born Sam Worthington). With familiar names such as Kyle Reese (Anton Yelchin) and familiar faces such as the original cyborg assassinyes you remember his lines, ""I'll be back"" and ""Hasta la vista, Baby."" There were a few scenes in the movie that were pretty predictable, but all-in-all this was a highly exhilarating movie. Then there were scenes that made you wonder about the power of choices, whether your decision is based on your environment and how you were brought up or whether it is something more internal-more biological. I'm a fan of Moon Bloodgood (Journeyman, Pathfinder), Common, and Anton Yelchin (Star Trek, Charlie Bartlett) acted well together, but weren't given the best of lineat times it seemed almost corny. But I still stand by that this movie was GREAT as great as the first Terminator!"
"reddiemurf81","8","0","0","5 July 2020"," This is right along the lines of what I wanted to see,,,
","I'll never for the life of me understand why this movie didn't do well at the box office.
I give it at least a 7.8 rating, at least. If not an 8. Was the movie without flaws,, well no. How many movies are without flaws? Not many. There were several spots I thought could've been done a lil better. A few scenes kind of transitioned weirdly,, and when Marcus came out of the pit, covered in mud and yelled up to the sky,,, that was kind of laughable,,, but It's forgivable (after all,, I'm not a filmmaker).
Other than that,,, I don't get what the problem was.<br/><br/>After the ending of T3,, this setting is pretty much where I saw the story going. I was overjoyed to hear that Christian Bale was taking on the role of John Connor (this was after Batman Begins, and TDK). I think he brought a great amount of energy and intensity to the role. I liked Howard getting cast as his wife. She's always great. Most of the remaining cast was fairly unknown to me. I didn't know what to think of Sam Worthington playing a Cyborg/Terminator who thinks he's human,, however after seeing it in the theater, and now again (11 yrs later),, I think his character brought a lot to the story. (Spoiler alert!!) He has no clue that he's part machine until he's involved in an explosion, and loses some skin. Even when John Connor is interrogating him, Marcus swears he has no clue of how he got this way (and he's telling the truth! He was killed by lethal injection in 2003,, then he wakes up in 2018,, that's enough to make anyone lose their minds). Anyways,,,<br/><br/>Without giving everything away,, I'll say a lil of what I thought was great about the moive -<br/><br/>THE SETTING - the atmosphere is very dystopian like.<br/><br/>TERMINATORS - I liked the fact that we see lots of Terminators (several different kinds) and there's no guessing what they are. Close to the end, we do see the T-800 in Arnold covering,, but until then the Terminators are all metal.<br/><br/>The Resistance - John Connor is part of the Resistance,, but he's not in charge of it all. He has a command of a unit of troops,, and when he's not out fighting he reviews tapes his mother made for him.<br/><br/>Like I've said,, this movie is what I wanted to see. I wish they had made at least 1 more following this one (of course,, 2 would've been preferable) with Bale as Connor. I think McG did a great job,,, too bad others didn't.<br/><br/>If you're going to watch this one,, I suggest you watch Terminators 1, 2, and 3 before this. I think Terminator Salvation follows those 3 perfectly. Do not bother viewing Genisys or Dark Fate at the same time (not that they are bad,, they just don't belong with these other movies,,, at least not i the order I just said. If you're going to watch Dark Fate,, then view T1, T2,, then Dark Fate).<br/><br/>Anyways,,, give this movie a chance,,, it really has gotten a bum rap."

","TS is a film that will wow your eyes and ears. It will be a standard for demonstrating the latest high-end home theater systems for several years. Do not, however, go to this film to stimulate the imagination. The plot has many holes patched with barely-there plot devices. I'm reminded of the film Thank You For Smoking when the character Jeff Mengall spoke of Hollywood plot holes getting filled with lines like ""Thank God we invented the... you know, whatever device."" In previous Terminator films, you could always assume that sending anything back in time took a lot of energy and resources - that's why you could accept that there was only one Terminator instead of 2+ working together. In this film, we are made to believe that fighting Skynet is like out-maneuvering a herd of angry elephants with laser beams on their heads.<br/><br/>In all, I gave this film a 7 because it does what a good futuristic action film should do: wows the eyes and ears. Just don't forget to check your disbelief at the door."

","I feel that this movie gets slated more than it should. It is a very flawed movie, but not terrible. Much better than T3 and the atrocious Genysis.<br/><br/>Firstly, Bale seems to get a lot of stick, yet I think he's more believable as an older version of Furlong's Connor than Stahl was.<br/><br/>I like the darker tone in this one, as opposed to the lame jokes thrown into T3 for the sake of it.<br/><br/>The scenes with the T-800 are a joy to watch, as well.<br/><br/>However, like many movies these days, this is full of plot holes and conflicting plot lines, and I think the character of Marcus is absolutely pointless, and like another reviewer stated, it capped all over what James Cameron did. According to the movie, Marcus died in 2003, so I'm assuming he was made part machine while is corpse was still ""fresh"". He's a far superior model of the T-800 which was built later in the timeline, it makes so sense. Even removing his character, the same story could have been told. Same goes for Dr Kogan. No explanation to the character but suddenly she's the face of Skynet? Why her? All we know is that she's a doctor and cancer victim, but she becomes the mother of the Terminators.<br/><br/>All in all, a decent action movie, which could have been better with a bit more thought given to the characters and the plot."

"fernandoschiavi","7","0","0","23 May 2020"," The film has its surprises, but does not bother, as it is respectful of the established chronology, but does not add anything new for the franchise
","After the controversial third film, which insisted on continuing a theoretically closed story in the second film and that brought some incongruities in its script, the duo of screenwriters John Brancato and Michael Ferris are once again responsible for the fourth film in the franchise ""The Terminator"", now under the direction of McG, produced by the Halcyon Company, which bought the rights to C2 in 2007. This is the first to happen after the nuclear holocaust caused by Skynet, with actor Christian Bale as John Connor the future leader of the resistance and Sam Worthington as the cyborg Marcus Wright. The film also features a Kyle Reese from the first ""Terminator"" as a teenager, played by Anton Yelchin, as well as showing the origin of the T-800.<br/><br/>The script, written in four hands by John D. Brancato and Michael Ferris, also responsible for T3, goes to great lengths to maintain mythology, insert elements and especially new robotic creatures and, at the same time, give a personal and global character to the fight against the machines, with the obvious intention of pleasing various types of public and, therefore, perhaps, not pleasing any. ""The Terminator: Salvation"" invests heavily in the post-apocalyptic tone, betting on desolate locations and new types of threats to establish a tone of urgency fundamental to the effectiveness of the story - and thus we soon met several new ""exterminators"" "", From aquatic robots to flying, passing by others that resemble motorcycles and, of course, a gigantic one that seems to be inspired by Transformers. With this, the action becomes practically uninterrupted, replacing the development of characters or even the plot with increasingly elaborate sequences that depend on visual effects and big explosions to work. The writers also add a new character - controversial, but which in theory does not contradict the chronology - who is not just the ""exterminator of the time"": Marcus Wright, a death sentence in 2003 who wakes up in 2018, finds that his bones have turned to metal and want to understand why.<br/><br/>However, he exaggerates himself in the exhibition (a term used to designate how the film gives us essential information about the story) because the directors feel the need to explain to the viewer each of the new exterminators, to create a subplot for Marcus, a dilemma of ""second chance"" ... The amount of implausible things is piling up to the point of unbearable. Starting with the coincidence of Marcus running into Kyle; for Kyle, a boy, to be number one on Skynet's ""wanted"" list; The simple fact that Skynet is after Kyle and John, thus, for free, no longer makes sense, as Skynet would have no way of knowing their future. At the same time, John Connor's bow is missing pieces and what bothers him most: McG made no effort to show why Connor was considered a kind of messiah. The character is revered without any explanation and do not come to say that it is only because he is the son of his mother, as this does not seem enough for the degree of idolatry that he receives throughout the projection.<br/><br/>Primary errors are notorious when using, for example, overexposure as a narrative resource, since, in addition to the introductory sign, it still depends on off-line narration, tapes recorded by Sarah Connor and, even worse, a long explanation provided by Helena Bonham Carter in the third act. As if that were not enough, Brancato and Ferris let absurd holes pass, such as the fact that Kyle drives perfectly although he makes it clear that he never drove a car before (something McG could have circumvented through a few plans that illustrated the boy's unpreparedness) and - infinitely worse - Skynet's refusal to kill Reese after imprisoning him, as this would put an end to the eternal persecution of John Connor.<br/><br/>On top of that, we have Christian Bale who doesn't convince like Connor. The actor has a big problem. As much as they try to turn him into a star, he always ends up overshadowed by others. If in The Dark Knight (2008), even though Batman, all the spotlight went to Heath Ledger's Joker, now it ends up in the background, despite the status of protagonist: Worthington is the highlight, and practically the only one to get some kind of more enthusiastic reaction from the audience. He is the element of surprise, which will account for the best turns and lead the audience to situations that will define the course of the characters. Yelchin, on the other hand, works just like Kyle Reese, especially when he starts speaking the phrases we know from the first film. After all, who doesn't remember ""come with me if you want to live""? Certainly T4 makes several references to pay homage to the first two films as much as possible, but, in doing so, it gets stuck in a pre-determined structure that the script itself tries to detach itself with the introduction of Marcus Wright. However, the premise that guided the previous features remains: in the middle of the biggest dispute with the machines, a life needs to be preserved at all costs. This time it's not Connor's, but his father's, Kyle Reese.<br/><br/>The most important thing to stand out in this continuation is that it messes with affective memories of the franchise and explains what was still a mystery in the previous films. Throughout the initial trilogy, war in the future was shown only in quick flashes, which placed us in the critical situation experienced by humans (especially as shown in the first film in 1984), and further hinted at what that life was like at that time, but without make it totally explicit. This time, we can emerge even more in a story that takes place entirely in the future after the nuclear holocaust and in the midst of the war between humans and machines. We got to know the Human Resistance command center and the bases scattered around the planet, the precarious conditions in which people lived with the scarcity of food and resources, how the attacks against the machines and the rules of that war were organized (avoid leaving at night not to be located by machines that used infrared). In this respect, director McG, photography by Shane Hurlbut and production designer by Martin Laing are effective in portraying that future as bleak and hopeless for humanity. All we see are rubble of buildings and entire cities in ruins denoting the massacre suffered by the human race. The images and makeup are dirty, showing the constant climate of war. The darker photograph further reinforces the tone of loneliness, abandonment and what it is like to live in fear that a machine will discover and exterminate them. Here, the machines also don't use human skin to infiltrate people. The idea of a metal endoskeleton walking and programmed to slaughter humans makes the sight much more threatening.<br/><br/>McG focuses on telling a story about the human being. In a world inhabited by machines, it is precisely in the most crucial moments of the plot that questions concerning man are put to the test. Not just in acts of courage, but in decisions, thoughts and fears. It is precisely in the figure of the mysterious Marcus (Sam Worthington) that these elements are best represented. In a devastated world, staying human is often one of the biggest challenges. Although it lacks the creativity of the sequences conceived by James Cameron in the first two films, this fourth chapter is clearly superior to the third in the ""action"" category. The first action scene involving John Connor (Bale) is quite intense and graphically interesting, with the would-be savior showing off in a very virile way, as expected from the hero who would be Earth's last hope, as Kyle Reese of Biehn in Terminator. Connor steps on the head of the mechanical carcass of power, symbolizing the hierarchical order established between him and his enemies, perhaps at the moment of more intelligence in the script of Michael Ferris and John D. Brancato. The chase of the various robot-killing robots to Marcus and Kyle is sensational, but it happens very early in the film. It is also worth saying that McG, normally a filmmaker unable to have a more ambitious idea, surprises especially in the long shot that, even in the first act, brings Connor into a helicopter, being hit by the shock wave of an explosion, falling with the device and leaving the cabin - all without apparent cuts. And if Danny Elfman's soundtrack (another irregular member of the team) explores the theme composed by Brad Fiedel reasonably well, the sound design of the film is the only really exceptional element of the project, deserving to be recognized in the awards season.<br/><br/>""Terminator: Salvation"" is neither surprising nor thrilling, staying most of the time away from the audience. The good action scenes immediately refer to other equally competent ones (there are sequences that seem to have been removed entirely from any Transformers), the director seems frightened by the responsibility of continuing something created by Cameron himself (who directed the first two films) and even the big cast, which still has names like Helena Bonham Carter, Anton Yelchin, Bryce Dallas Howard and Jane Alexander (four times nominated for an Oscar), cannot create greater empathy. It is better to go far and watch the two features that started this mythology and that, at least, have something to say. The film has its surprises, but all of them are wired from the beginning. It does not bother, as it is respectful of the established chronology, but does not add anything new. And the result, despite all the explosions, running and chasing, is to provoke yawns."

More realistic than the future war scenes in T1 & T2!<br/><br/>Also Bale's acting is good as is everybody else's
and the film had some nice new ideas like the submarine command centre
and some new types of machines used by Skynet.
Also the T-600 was very nice!<br/><br/>I think that the weak point of the film is the story/plot.
Yes, it is going to a new direction which is good,
it's not another copy of T1 or T2,
it feels like a logical continuation of the first 2 films,
we are now at the future war against the machines and see what happens there.
But overall, it feels like a very good episode of a Terminator series..,
not like a sequel of the first movies. We just see how the war is

Half of the movie is about his intentions and if he is good or bad..<br/><br/>I think that a bit more complex story or something more interesting in the story than just a new type of Terminator? again,

","Why all the hate? I have loved the Terminator-Franchise for 30+ years now and I never felt that this was a poor installment or did not feel like Terminator or whatever, quite the opposite: I guess it is safe to say that most people agree that part 2 was the best part, and in my opinion, this is the second best, followed by the first one, than the third and then - with some distance - the sixth, and then there is an even larger stretch and then comes the fifth with ""country girl"" Emilia C. as the otherwise tough Sarah C. and the unlikable Jason C. as an unlikable, unworthy version of John C. . I would definitely rank the excellent Terminator SCC - show (and anything else) before the fifth part, but back to Salvation: perfect story, perfect action, perfect cast (there is Anton Yelchin in it!! And Sam Worthington, and Bryce D. Howard, Helena B.-C. and even a glimpse of Arnie - what more can you ask for?) The characters and story are compatible with the original material/""lore"", but it also has some fresh ideas, is moving, thrilling, exciting. Nothing more to say. Especially after the latest installments the haters should stop bashing this excellent movie, I think."

","While i do rank Terminator: Salvation in last place in the Terminator franchise, this is by no means a bad movie, giving it a 7/10! the movie finally tries to show the post-Judgment Day future war we always longed to see since T1. the machines are perfectly executed, with the T-800 endoskeleton in the film's last act looking amazing - you can hardly tell which parts are CGI the practical effects look so good! the one thing i LOVE about this movie is that the film uses the original approach to making a Terminator film - using mostly practical effects and CGI sparingly, something Genisys and Dark Fate lack a bit. the Harvester machine and Hunter-Killers make my jaw drop everytime! in the middle of the movie John is shown still listening to You Could Be Mine after almost 25 years, i think that is a pretty neat callback to T2!<br/><br/>Christian Bale takes over the role of John Connor, previously portrayed by Nick Stahl as a young adult and Edward Furlong as a child. you really feel the stress and emotions the war has had on him! the late Anton Yelchin is perfectly cast as a teenage Kyle Reese, even looking a bit like a younger Michael Biehn!<br/><br/>my only problems with this film are:
*(minor) problem - the lack of the colon in the title.
*the film's PG-13 rating, rather than being R rated.
*the plot being a bit slow at times.
*the future war in this movie isn't the war-torn landscape with plasma lasers flying through the night. we are rather given a daytime desert landscape. Kyle specifically states in T1 that the machines hunt better at night, but this one takes place mostly during the daytime.<br/><br/>still - the film is an enjoyable one, and i would have loved to see the remaining 2 films of this trilogy come to fruition!"

Christian Bale is really good as John Connor even if he feels abit miscast but hey so was Sam Worthington, i think that's only because i was used to seeing him as Batman or in big weighty dramatic roles but he's still a good solid serious & intense action hero here because he's such an excellent actor, we also have the then ""next big thing"" of the time Sam Worthington who was the lead in James Cameron's sci-fi epic ""Avatar"" & because of him being pushed as the next big star i think he was dropped quickly into big budget blockbuster films such as this Terminator film & the huge fantasy adventure Clash of the Titans & here Mr. Worthington if ok but nothing special as just like his other lead roles he's actually a very bland actor to lead a big movie but Hollywood loved him at that time but his fire very quickly died out & he's mostly stars in DTV flicks now.<br/><br/>""TERMINATOR SALVATION"" is an action packed sci-fi Thriller with excellent special fx & lots of Terminators this time & an Awesome looking apocalyptic landscape, the look is gritty & ""Mad Max"" style, a solid good cast & good music score, i enjoyed this film & it's a good film in the franchise, a big budget sci-fi action popcorn flick with some stunning shots of an apocalyptic landscape & there's a real grittiness to the look & feel."
"classicsoncall","7","0","0","11 January 2020"," ""...what else could you be, if not a machine?""
","It's been too long since I've watched the prior Terminator flicks, and those were viewed out of order so my recollection of the entire mythology is circumspect. The whole time travel concept is enough to give one a headache, and this one ups the ante to an unimaginable degree. If you recall the original film with Arnold, the son of Sarah Connor, that would be John Connor in this story, sent Kyle Reese back in time to prevent the murder of Sarah, his own mother. Didn't Kyle Reese wind up becoming the father of John Connor? So now it's 2018 and Kyle Reese (Anton Yelchin) basically looks like a teenager, and there was an allusion to Kyle being younger than Connor. You see how this all gets too convoluted? And I'm not even trying to keep the dates concerning all the sequels in mind as it becomes nearly impossible.<br/><br/>With that, as a stand alone story, this one is a decent actioner, with cool special effects but limited character development. John Connor's (Christian Bale) admonition to wife Kate (Bryce Dallas Howard) stating ""I'll be back"" isn't nearly as iconic as Schwarzenneger's in ""The Terminator"", and almost seemed forced to allude to the original picture. Sam Worthington was capable as the human/machine, infiltration prototype that Cyberdyne developed who inadvertently brought Connor to Skynet headquarters without meaning to. I liked the character of Blair Williams, and even more the actress's real name, Moon Bloodgood. If that's not one of the coolest names ever, I don't know what is.<br/><br/>Putting all things in perspective, it's probably best to note John Connor's voice over narration as the picture ended. He said that ""There is no fate but what we make"". Which is pretty much what the film makers decide when they put these things together."
"patriciogl10","6","0","0","16 December 2019"," A fairly dim portrayal of a Terminator story.
","What I find interesting and appealing about this film is its tone, regarding both plot and color palette, which defines a more gritty ambience imbued with hopelessness and a distinct dystopian feel.<br/><br/>Sam Worthington contributes with a correct performance, Anton Yelchin is fantastic as a young rebellious Kyle Reese. And that leaves us with Christian Bale delivering John Connor in a deficient and poor manner. I find him inadequate for the role, he failed to transmit anything the character is known for. He has a problem with properly conveying a well-known character convincingly. I will say though, that he is better as John Connor than he is Bruce Wayne/Batman where is performance is truly abysmal.<br/><br/>Besides that and some obvious plot issues, something which affects the majority of Terminator films, Salvation still manages to get pass all that to be seen as an acceptable form of entertainment, a Terminator film with a more distinctive setting and atmosphere, which definitely brings something a bit different to the table."

","I just rewatched this film and enjoyed it a lot more on this second viewing. The performances are great all around. The effects are rather amazing and the plot travels in a lot of directions. Bale delivers a top performance in his part and so does Worthington. There really isn't a bad actor in this film.<br/><br/>This whole movie is action from start to finish and the number of locations make this a captivating ride. It really is jam packed with action, everything from helicopters, to water to desert to air to motorbikes to gunfights to hand to hand fighting. When one considers it all, it's quite an achievement.<br/><br/>The problem I think with this film was that it wasn't what people were expecting after the third movie. It is not a bad film. I think the current 6.5 rating is almost spot on. Considering my all time favourite movies are an eight or a nine, this is good.<br/><br/>The effects and sets and ""creature"" designs are spectacular. I'd say far better than the most modern Dark Fate movie. It has many scenes that could have been done with a lot less but the factory scenes for example are loaded with extra sparks and details. The lighting is noticeably great too. The actual locations are varied and well chosen.<br/><br/>If I had to pick a flaw, the Terminators have a thing for always throwing people instead of killing them more efficiently. And there were Terminators wearing bandanna's and various outfits, which is a bit strange.<br/><br/>There's much more to be said about this piece of entertainment but overall it's a great popcorn sci-fi flick if something from this genre is to your wanting.

","This review contains spoilers.<br/><br/>'Terminator Salvation' is the sequel to Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines. The movie was released in 2009. The fourth installment to the Terminator franchise is directed by McG, written by John Brancato and Michael Ferris, and stars Christian Bale, Sam Worthington, Anton Yelchin, and Moon Bloodgood. The movie takes place after Judgment Day and takes place during the opening years of the war between the Resistance and Skynet.<br/><br/>Terminator Salvation does its best in trying to present the war against the machines in the fourth installment of the movie. This does not make for an excellent movie. The movie meanders along and the promise of the apocalyptic fight with John Connor against the machines. The movie does not offer any satisfying conclusion. It simply presents events and tries to expand the backstory with the Terminator franchise. The ending in this movie resembles a sitcom where the characters are more or less in the same position they were from the start of the movie. This is the biggest detraction on the entire movie.<br/><br/>The action and production in this movie are overall solid. There is a disappointment in the color choices for this movie as any of the futuristic scenes in Terminator 2: Judgment Day do not come into view here. Terminator Salvation is encompassed by brown and light hues from the desert scenes. The dark and blue scenes from Terminator 2: Judgment Day is not present here. It makes for a disappointing experience as it feels like the movie is not fulfilling its promise from the earlier movies.<br/><br/>The characters in this movie are overall solid. John Connor, played by Christian Bale, has the intensity that fans of the series would expect. The casting of John Connor is great and he is easily one of the hallmarks of the movie. Sam Worthington plays Marcus Wright, a human-terminator hybrid. He does an appreciable job but his character had too much screen time. It felt like the movie wanted to have a cinematic universe of Terminators, rather than trying to tell a good stand-alone movie. I felt that the movie should have focused on Marcus Wright and had John Connor in a smaller role if this was what the movie wanted to go for. This puts the movie in a tough position as the movies have always been about the terminators and the Connor family. The movie fails to be both a movie about John Connor and Marcus Wright. They should have done one or the other and not both.<br/><br/>It is hard to recommend Terminator Salvation. The movie has too many flaws even though the action is solid. I would not recommend 'Terminator Salvation'.<br/><br/>Grade: D"

","This is more of a review of why I don't think it worked.<br/><br/>Back in 2005 I was living in New York City, a friend of mine who knew some people in the business discovered a rumor about the ending of the next Terminator movie. <br/><br/>The rumor was John Connor dies and his face is surgically placed on a reprogrammed terminator. They do this so the people don't lose hope in their savior. The terminator(Connor) learns from the tapes his mother left him. He leads the human rebellion to victory. <br/><br/>I believe this to be true. After seeing Salvation I felt odd when the movie ended. I realized I didn't feel connected to Connor at all. We had all watched this character grow through the other movies though I felt no connection to him in this film. I did feel more of a connection with Marcus though. <br/><br/>Then I thought to myself, they focused more on Marcus than Connor in this film. Why? Why would they do this? He's a machine and dies in the end? Connor's supposed to be the hero, the one we take the ride with and it did not feel that way. <br/><br/>I feel this is proof the original script had Connor dying in the end and the terminator we had formed a connection with would take his place. It seems to me the studio did not like that ending and made the switch late in the game and failed to realize the entire movie was based on and leading up to this event and did not work without it. <br/><br/>They couldn't go back and rewrite the entire thing so they just made a few changes, gave us this hacked together movie and took our money. <br/><br/>My question to the writers/Director is, how was Marcus so advanced when he was built in the past? Even if he was built in the time the movie takes place, how is he so advanced when Skynet is just rolling out the T-800? It doesn't make sense. The only thing I could think of is......Marcus was sent back from an even further future. In the end, this movie is a mess."

","You will not recognize the actors, or so little. Even the cameo of Schwarzenegger is computer-generated. The film does not bring much new data. It seems to be mixing time periods, but it does not matter. The machine world has been experimenting a new generation of robots, partly human (brain and heart, etc) and partly machine to infiltrate the resistance. They are capturing human beings now to create that new army of infiltrators. Logical but not revolutionary, my dear Watson, or is it Sherlock Holmes, I was going to say Shakespeare. Then the resistance has been able to devise a signal that can freeze the machines that are always controlled by come kind of wave. Interesting but only experimented at local level. The new thing though is that the only existing hybrid retains enough humanity to be a machine for the machines, and recognizable as such by them, but with a real loyalty to humans to the point of helping John Connor come into the headquarters of Skynet, the network that controls all the machines, liberate the prisoners there, have a final fight with the impersonation of Schwarzenegger, escape with Kyle Reeves, a key to the future and destroy the place, which is a ""given back"" for a ""given gift"" because the military headquarters of the resistance had been destroyed because they tried to send a general air strike on Skynet in San Francisco, a move which was successfully opposed by John Connor and thus did not happen, but the signal these generals had sent to all units had had the effect of being detected by Skynet who had sent their task force to clear the place in one big air strike. This episode, that will have to have a sequel since the salvation is not finished yet and has not reached liberation, ends with the hybrid being, Marcus Wright, giving his human heart to John Connor to save him before John Connors dies of his wounds. That human touch, quite in the style of Jesus giving his life to save humanity is going soft on our emotions and that's its main objective. A few tears please. But all together the story has not advanced a lot, except to prepare an eventual next episode that could be at least the first step towards liberation. But frankly the main danger of humanity today is not machines and an eventual take over from them, which would explain the relative flop of this film. It is more the take over the financial tycoons and traders of Wall Street had been able to perform leading the world nearly to the bottom of the abyss, at least to the brink of it. When I see the anti-machine or anti-technology stand of some in our society particularly among educators, I am amazed. This very week a university professor in education is advising us to take into account as the basis of our reflection the children who only have school at their disposal to acquire school-knowledge. I would like that very acute young man to tell me today what school-knowledge is in the knowledge economy and society, and to point out to me the child (a wolf child I guess, since so far wolves don't have TVs and smart phones) who would have had access to no other source of knowledge than school. These fake social climbing and politically-minded though not politically-correct except among Trotskyites intellectuals were those who refused to use the radio in class, and then who considered television as the killing challenger of school, and now consider that all communication tools have to be banned from schools and universities, first of all smart phones. Yes there are some in our universities who think smart phones are nothing but a means of cheating. This ideology is behind the Terminator series, but it is today very passé, very prehistorical, if history started with the GUIs (Graphical Users Interfaces). A highly considered communication expert I read in some paper lately considers that the technological revolution of our time started in the early 1990s. What an ignoramus. I would have sworn the Internet was first successfully tested between Stanford and Oakland, California, in the fall 1969, and that the first GUI was invented by Apple for its first McIntosh, and then by Microsoft with Windows 3.1, both at the beginning of the 1980s. Why should we be afraid of machines? The Matrix was a lot more positive on the subject, even if the tale needs a human sacrifice, a Savior of sorts to conquer peace with machines and to rebut for a while the engineering mind behind it all, behind all the Mr. Smiths of this world.<br/><br/>Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Paris 8 Saint Denis, University Paris 12 Créteil, CEGID"

Even watching Marcus Wright fight and fix cars and radios. then when he goes to skynet, skynet reads all the knowledge he knows that gives skynet the knowledge not just to find and stop Connor but skills to fight and use human resourceful skills. So what i mean is its got depth like it shuts up those nerds when they ask questions like how does a Terminator know how to fix a car in T-2 and fight 1 on 1 combat with no weapons. you will see a terminator pick up a gun near the end of the film and throw it away knowing it don't need weapons any more. Just have to be a bit open minded. I've seen worse and thought those films were good so i think it this film was brilliant but not in the same brilliance as James Cam Terminators!!. btw if your an Arnie fan like me, i won't worry that he won't be in the next films even if he is cgi, at least he won't look old (and he will ""BE BACK!!"" coz he said in T-3 to John ""you will be Terminated blah blah"" ""but but by who?""

","I couldn't help wondering to myself as I watched this fourth instalment of the Terminator franchise exactly why Christian Bale felt it was a film worth getting all emotional over during it's making. I never listened to his apparently despotic rant at some hapless crew member, but it was something to hear apparently. It would have cast a bad light upon Mr. Bale under any circumstances, but when he carries on like that over a piece of cinematic bubble gum like this you've really got to wonder whether he isn't taking himself a little too seriously.<br/><br/>Bale plays John Connor, leader of the resistance against the robots of Skynet. He learns that Kyle Reese, the man who will eventually travel back in time to save his mother from Arnie Schwarzenneger but who is now just a teenager – this being the bit of time sandwiched between the future and the past (!) – is the number one termination target of Syknet When Reese inevitably gets himself captured, Connor must attempt to delay a planned all-out attack on the headquarters by the resistance to give him time to rescue the boy who will become the man who will save his mother and become his father. Or something.<br/><br/>The fourth instalment bears no resemblance – and only passing relevance – to the first Terminator film, and has more of the look of a Mad Max episode – but with a muddier palette and a surprisingly subdued musical score. We're treated to a whole new army of different types of terminators – hydrobots, moto-terminators, etc – who look suspiciously like they have been added to the mix to give the marketing department some more tie-in toys to push, or to serve as an extended ad for the Playstation spin-off. The pace rarely sags, but the plot lacks imagination and all the film's creativity is confined to the mind-blowing special effects."

While watching, TS seemed like a combination of ""The Road Warrior"", ""Transformers"", ""Escape From New York"" and ""The Matrix"" but is consistent with the thematic continuity of the Terminator series.<br/><br/>Not easily recognizable, Sam Worthington chalks up high marks as John Connor's half man/half machine enemy by programming and ally by his roots in humanity. His performance is loaded with validity, vitality and energy and challenges Bale's characterization of the man destined to save the world from the machines.<br/><br/>Bale is transitive in his portrayal of a modern day J.C., but adequately toughened up to fit into the framework of sophisticated weaponry and gritty close encounters with savage machines and not-so-friendly humans in the scary detritus of decaying old buildings, vehicle skeletons, lifeless trees and barren, unsightly backdrops of war and chaos. In this setting he prevails with strong support from his followers. This is where the symbolism ends.<br/><br/>The message left on tape from his mother spells out a mission wherein he must defy the command hierarchy set on destroying Skynet. But first he must learn to trust the man (or thing) he fears the most in order to save his own father whom he predates by a good twenty years. The elusive Kyle and his child companion, Star, are sought, and nearly lost in a prison accessible only by the T-800 he fears and later emulates.<br/><br/>Command fails to recognize his plea to stand down. Michael Ironside is credible in the role as the seeker of retribution, but his power is undermined by haste as his fool-proof plan backfires into a watery grave. Being cold and calculating is the machine-like trait Conner is determined to countervail with the message about what makes us different. But is defiance a good lesson?<br/><br/>Uncommon for an Indie film, the 200 million budget is exceeded to almost double and clearly sets the stage for what could be a long list of follow-ons.

","Terminator Salvation is the 4th film in the ""Terminator Franchise"" and serves as a direct sequel to the previous three movies - The Terminator (1984), Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991), and Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines (2003). The premise is simple,after Skynet has destroyed much of humanity in a nuclear holocaust, a group of survivors led by John Connor struggles to keep the machines from finishing the job. Not so simple, as the fans know, is the overall story of the franchise which has time traveling as main device.Obviously there are a few paradoxes and every time a new terminator movie is released, things get a bit more complicated,a bit more far-fetched and inconsistencies start to show. I could easily see past that if the only problem of the movie were this minor flaws but that's not the case... The cgi and the special effects are good as expected but the actions scenes in Terminator Salvation are over the top and unrealistic,the main characters get thrown around,beat, they fall from awful highs and nothing serious ever happens to them. I know this is a film, but there has to be a limit ,otherwise it becomes ridiculous and turns into a circus.Regarding the acting, Anton Yelchin was great( as he always is) in the role of the young Kyle Reese and same thing goes for Sam Worthington who played the death row inmate turned into terminator Marcus Wright.Christian Bale on the other hand was a total disaster. He seemed more of a machine then the machines his character was fighting. Unable to convey any kind of emotion, he delivered a truly one-dimensional performance which is kind of a disappointment because he has proofed several times his value as an actor. Overall, I think this film shouldn't have been made. This franchise keeps being revived only because its still bankable when the only reason to do so should be because there's still a story worth telling or a direction worth exploring.<br/><br/>6/10"

I had a feeling that I was going to watch somewhat of a destruction of human's type movie when going into this movie, but that is what to expect with the Terminator movies. You don't know what's going on most of the time tho and end up trying to figure out where this movie fits in with the other Terminators. Bale, last seeing him in ""The Dark Knight"" which he did a superb job in playing John Connor which is a big role for him in this one too which he does a great job with. Also this movie leaves you wondering what happens after this, well hopefully not another movie for the Terminators.<br/><br/>I mean look at Saw, already on it's sixth one and is still some how making death traps even though jigsaw died in the third movie. After only seeing Worthington in this movie you will start to like him I think and he has an upcoming role in hopefully a blockbuster hit movie Avatar which I am looking forward to seeing. Along with great special effects and graphics they have made somewhat of a computer generated face of Schwarzenegger which is done so well that will have you believe that it is him, but he does not talk at all. Anyways, take a look at this one if you liked the other Terminators and you might find this one fun to watch."

","I went into Terminator Salvation with a lot of hope and anticipation and i came out somewhat bemused by the movie itself.<br/><br/>First of all, there were some plot holes i found misleading. If Skynet is constantly monitoring Marcus, and the live feed is being sent back, why didn't they attack John Connor much earlier? They had the firepower, humanity was on their knees, what was stopping them from killing the might man.<br/><br/>Sam Worthington and Anton Yelchin were the only good actors in the film. Christian Bale's performance was what i expected from him. I mean, its obvious he intentionally speaks in that gruff tone. Bryce Dallas Howard pretty much played cohort, and there wasn't enough time for her character to develop, yet alone get us used to her.<br/><br/>6/10 is, in my eyes fair, but not as great as the other terminator movies."

","I would have to say first of all that i wasn't too crazy about Christian bale playing john Connor,john Connor is supposed to be the center of the terminator story but if anything i would say the most inspiring character of the film would be Marcus write played by Sam Worthington. I find Christian bale is a very good actor from what I've seen in the new batman films and shack and equilibrium,but it was hard for me to take hims seriously as john Connor,I found he was being more himself and only felt a real terminator atmosphere more toward the end of the movie,the earlier scenes felt like i was watching a transformers spin off or something,the soundtrack in the first three films were also more enjoyable for me,the intro although was well done,and bring back the famous one liners like,'I'll be back',and 'come with me if you want to live' made light of things,the acting for most characters was fair enough,kyle Reese was very enjoyable but Sam Worthington really did an excellent job,it will never,I mean never be the same without Arnold,(the real Arnold,for all who saw the movie)but it did okay without him,the t-600s where nicely done very freaky looking bulky and bad ass,but the t-800 toward the end of the movie was not the same,it had a darker almost blackish grey coating of metal instead of the slick silvery coating which looked very different,the action scenes were very cool,and the cgi was nice also,i really liked the motor terminators,that was new and unexpected if you ask me,i wish the movie was more original though,i simply didn't have enough of that terminator feel to it.I,m not gonna say it was as good as the first or second obviously,but for a terminator movie that goes outside it's conventional atmosphere and story,it was okay enough."

","Where does this ridiculous British invasion going to end?! You have a British woman playing Sarah Connor on the Sarah Connor Chronicles. I guess it was only a matter of time before you gave the part of John Connor to a Brit as well! You ruined the new Batman movie with this horrid Brit with a lisp, and now you cast him as John Connor in the terminator! Excuse me, but are Sarah & John Connor British or American!? Because the people that are portraying them are certainly not American. Excuse me, for wanting my movies to be realistic! As far as I am concerned the movie makers are taking this British invasion rubbish a bit too far. For me, the worst part is not that Chritian Bale is British, although it is a fair point. The worst is Christian Bale himself. The guy is gross, he has a lisp, and is one of the worst actors I have ever seen in my lifetime. I don't get it. Was it a low budget movie ..or what?! Is the public so easily brainwashed?! Someone says, ""oh, he's cute"", and no one can think for themselves anymore? The guy is horrid! So, okay, suppose we forget that he is a Brit playing the role of an American icon. What does this say about America. We do not have an American good enough to fill the role of the American icon John Connor that supposedly saves the world? So, we get some hideous Brit with a lisp to fill the part? Well, I have lived abroad for some years now, yearning to be back home in America. But if this is what America has become, then I am not sure I ever want to go home. What's next? Hey, why not get some Brit to play the part of John Wayne! We certainly cannot find an American to fit the bill! Wake up people! Smell the coffee, before the Brits take over everything, and there is nothing truly American left! Recently someone told me about a really good series that was running in America, called Moonlight. So, I checked it out. And guess what? The lead female was a Brit playing an American reporter. Well, I guess they couldn't find an American actress good enough for that part either! Seems like everywhere I turn, there is a Brit playing the part of an American. Have we run out of American Actresses/ Actors?! Am I the only one that takes offense to this?! Am I the only one that can see how bad this makes America look?! Well, all I can say is ..I certainly hope not. Have I watched the movie ...you couldn't pay me enough. I do not have to watch it to know it's bad. :-) Chritian Bale is hideous, and a poor excuse for an actor."

","I enjoyed all 3 of the past terminator movies. But Terminator Salvation was so BORING and I didn't enjoy it. This entry did not follow the storyline of the past movies and had way too many characters. Also, there were hardly any terminators in it, and when there was a terminator they were useless and dumb. In this movie there was no tension and drama, it was like watching a cliché action movie. Unlike the other 3 terminator movies which had you on the edge of your seat, wanting to know the end, this terminator movie was not scary and horrific, it was just endless talking, shouting and typical gun shooting. I feel they didn't develop the characters enough, and you didn't know who was who until the end of the movie. The characters were boring and I didn't care who died or survived because they weren't developed enough, I think the producers just made up some unimportant characters and threw them into the terminator movie. Some vital characters didn't appear until three quarters through the movie! The other 3 terminator movies had some comedy, while this movie was just serious through the whole movie, BORING. My last point is that they didn't bring Arnold Schwarzenegger back! Without him the movie was not terminator anymore! Overall this movie was pointless, boring and should've never happened. You may as well watch the past 3 terminator movies or the 5 one that just came out, don't waste your time on terminator salvation."
"Michael_Elliott","Null","4","12","29 May 2009"," This is Judgment Day?
","Terminator Salvation (2009) <br/><br/>** (out of 4) <br/><br/>Fourth film in the series is a crashing halt due to some rather bland direction and an even blander vision of a screenplay. This time the film takes place in 2018, after Judgment Day, and it appears the machines are about to destroy the human race. John Connor (Christian Bale) is still battling the machines as a mysterious man (Sam Worthington) tries to help the young Kyle Reese reach safety. I know a lot of people were going into this film with low expectations but I actually had high ones but they were pretty much letdown by the twenty-minute mark and things really didn't get any better. I would personally argue against the PG-13 rating and I wasn't too thrilled with a certain star not being involved but the biggest problem here was the rather lackluster direction by McG. The entire vision of the post-Judgment Day came as a major disappointment. After hearing about these events in the first three movies I couldn't help but have a ""that's it?"" feeling while watching this movie. Yes, the effects are bigger and there are some newer creations but none of them had a Judgment Day feel to them. You might say the events here are just leading for a bigger fifth film but that doesn't make this one here any better. I found the action scenes to be over the top but to me they were just a bunch of noise without any emotion or punch to them. The only thing that saved this film from being a complete bomb was the final thirty-minutes after a certain twist in the story that I won't ruin. I thought the twist was the first time anything smart actually happened and it's one of the few scenes where it appears some thought and character development was going on. I always enjoy watching Bale but found him to be another disappointment here. I didn't mind his dark and gloomy voice in the two Batman movies but I found it rather annoying here. Sam Worthington is the one who really steals the film here and at times I couldn't help but wish he was playing Connor. Helena Bonham Carter is wasted in her role. There's a cameo here, which was certainly meant to make you cheer but I found it to be very stupid and rather corny. Will I go watch a fifth film? I certainly will but I really hope it's a major improvement over this one."

John Connor (Christian Bale) <br/><br/>If you are reading this review, you probably know more about the Terminator legend than I do, or at least as much because of Arnold Schwarzenegger's role in the original Terminator and the fascination about the relationship between humans and machines. It's 2018, not far from now, and Skynet has the upper hand, not a cellular phone company but the system governing machines that rule the world.<br/><br/>John Connor (Christian Bale) is the leader of the resistance, and we, the audience are asked to suspend our belief about warping time (first Star Trek this summer, now Terminator), where a hero might meet his first officer or dad or Helena Bonham Carter, or a bad reproduction of Arnold. At any rate, director McG and the Catwoman writers have woven into the metal mélange of this sci-fi fantasy allusions to the Holocaust's boxcars of death, Mad Max's tangled landscapes, Apocalypse Now's menacing helicopter missions, and The Wizard of Oz's hopeful heart. Along the way are subtle references to futile wars such as in Iraq and the need for leadership over dictatorship. Terminator tries too much, but, hey, better than not at all or a film like Miss March.<br/><br/>While the film spends precious little time with any theme other than mankind vs. machines, it has non-stop action for a summer blockbuster well worth the time unless you decide to take off for the future, a dicey business at best, as any of this film's heroes can attest. <br/><br/>""I knew it.

","Re-watching the Terminator franchise several times over, I begin to wonder why Salvation got such a bad wrap. It's not perfect by any means, but it had the franchise going in the only logical direction: The future war! Let's be honest, T3 was just a bad rehash of T2. It had a good ending but it really didn't do anything for the series as a whole. Salvation gave us an early look at the war against the machines. We finally got to see a gritty and war-torn world where John Connor was the military figure we kept hearing about.<br/><br/>I didn't feel the movie needed Arnold, and I stand by that. Christian Bale was perfect for the role of John Connor(way better than Nick Stahl or Jason Clarke). The Marcus Wright character was also great, except for the fact he was focused on more than Connor.<br/><br/>After seeing Genysis, I will still continue to count Salvation as the most recent in the franchise. Genysis isn't un-watchable, but again, it was just a rehash of the first 2 films.<br/><br/>I would love to see the franchise be re-evaluated and maybe continued again from Salvation, although I'm sure that won't happen."
"TheLittleSongbird","5","3","8","13 September 2015"," The Terminator franchise continues to stumble with Terminator Salvation
","The first two Terminator films are fantastic films and both are among the best of the action genre. The third film, Rise of the Machines signalled the franchise's decline, but while flawed (mainly down to being unbalanced and too more-of-the-same) is not that bad a film. While Terminator Salvation is better than Terminator Genysis, instead of improving on the problems of Rise of the Machines it continues the stumbling block, not a terrible film, but a disappointing and not too great one, both in comparison to the first two and on its own.<br/><br/>Starting with the good points, Terminator Salvation is a good-looking film, with strikingly atmospheric post-apocalyptic scenery, stylish photography and slick editing that is neither too hurried or static. The special effects are of typically solid quality, some of them even excellent with the exception of some shabby-looking Terminators. Some of the action is very exciting and compellingly choreographed, without causing a headache or inducing a seizure, and the music is haunting and rousing. There are some fun references also to the older films without feeling forced at all, and a couple of performances are good. Coming off best is Anton Yelchin in a fantastically intense but also subtle performance, and while he does have his bland moments Sam Worthington does show some charisma and is not as bland as feared.<br/><br/>On the other hand, while some of the action is pulsating excitement, other action sequences are very loud but also very soulless, and it comes at the expense of any character development, which is skimpy at best, Marcus is the only one that really gets an arc that maintains some interest but even that's not completely attention-grabbing. The script is often awkward in flow, is overly reliant on sloppily written exposition and is too often too heavy-handed, and the story, apart from a reasonably smart twist half an hour before the end, can be convoluted, is more desperate than inventive (doing little with the post-apocalyptic atmosphere) and lacks the dark mystery, suspense and thrills of the first two. Credit is due for it not being more of the same and trying to be different, but one can't help thinking that it was rather too different, other than the characters' names it is basically unrecognisable from before and that might not be a good thing for some, and unfortunately the huge pile of clichés that the film has disallow it from having its own personality or doing anything new.<br/><br/>McG's direction is muddled and unfocused, the pacing generally could have done with more tightness and most of the acting is not that great. Bryce Dallas Howard fares the best of the ladies and does dependably but her limited material is beneath her, while Helena Bonham Carter is forgettable and out of place and Moon Bloodgood is vapid and could easily have been cut from the film and nobody would have noticed. Most disappointing is Christian Bale, he is an actor with a lot of talent but he phones it in and is incredibly stiff in a role that has very little to it other than talking/shouting into speakers and walkie-talkies, it's not just that it's not a good performance and a shameful waste of talent but also because of how badly written the character is. The CGI-ed Arnold Schwarzenegger is nice to see, but is a little clumsily incorporated and unnecessary at the same time.<br/><br/>In conclusion, not a terrible film but instead of being improving on the previous film, despite some good things, the Terminator franchise continues to stumble. 5/10 Bethany Cox"
"alindsay-al","3","3","8","3 July 2015"," A poor cash grab
","I am getting the chance to see terminator genysis tonight so I finally have to review the most recent terminator film and that is terminator salvation. Set in the year 2018 after judgement day, John Connor and the resistance attempt to find a way to stop skynet in the war. While a mysterious criminal called Marcus Wright meets Kyle Reese and they have their own reason to track down Connor. Christian bale was cast as John Connor and this was a complete mixed bag. This performance was pretty close to when he played Batman in the dark knight and sometimes it seems he is just growling and shouting for no reason in this film in his very noticeable batman voice. This does kind of work though for the character of John Connor and there are times when his character is expanded and looked at that works for the film. Now I have never been a fan of Sam Worthington and his character in this film is not a likable guy and he never grew on me once throughout the film and took away from the film. The girl that meets Marcus Wright is a terrible actress and she could and should have been written out of the film because you don't care about their romance and it such an insignificant part of the film. Helena Bonham Carter is in the film and even though she is a key part of the film she is barely in the film and she never got a chance to develop like she should have done. The one pretty good performance in this film is Anton yelchin as Kyle reese, I thought he nailed the damage of the character and the layers that the character should have. The story is just complete garbage and it actually goes quite a way to take away from the other films. The character development just isn't there, there are two stories where they could have easily made it one and a romance that you really just won't care about. The script is utterly terrible also the dialogue is just so dull and ridiculous that really doesn't help these characters. And no the odd reference to the other films does not make good dialogue. There are some fun action scenes that are directed well and look good, but then there are some awful over cgi based action scenes that really hurt the movie. Overall this is another really poor terminator film and I'm really hoping this franchise gets the film it deserves in genesyis."

I don't mind you saying he wasn't good, even though he was great, but next time come up with your own critique and don't use someone else's.

"nithin-dominic-koshy","10","3","8","29 June 2009"," Terminator, yes Salvation, no!
","This review contains spoilers. <br/><br/>Where I come from, a lot of people have seen Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991) before gaining access to the rarely obtainable The Terminator (1984). I had seen bits of T2, but not enough to become familiar with the concept. So my fortune of seeing The Terminator first made me eager to watch the second, and when I did, both the movies went to the list of my childhood favorites. <br/><br/>Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines (2003) was fairly good according to me, although I had wanted more content, not action. And Terminator Salvation what happened, McG? <br/><br/>I remember seeing an interview of director McG, where he had commented on the unnecessary amount of money spent on a film's special effects. He believed in being economical and optimal. He achieved that, but at the cost of the story, the drama and the ideals that the Terminator series stood for. <br/><br/>In order to understand TS, one has to recall the past, the future, or whatever the directors James Cameron and Jonathan Mostow had presented in the earlier installments. <br/><br/>Right now, I am trying to piece the time-lines of all the four movies in a coherent manner. <br/><br/>*** Spoilers Begin Here ***<br/><br/>The year is 2018. Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn in the 1980s, Anton Yelchin in TS), a boy who had grown up in harsh apocalyptic Blade-Runner-The- Matrix-Transformers-like surroundings, was rescued by John Connor (Christian Bale) and Marcus Wright (Sam Worthington) from Skynet, a self-aware Artificial Intelligent system. John does not get to hand over a photograph of his mother Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) to Kyle even after all this.<br/><br/>This is the franchise's backbone, but when it was completely dismissed, a true Terminator fan is bound to be disappointed. <br/><br/>What is landmark about this subplot? Reese (Yelchin) will be infatuated with the woman in the photo. He will also be sent back in time to 1984 to save her from a cybernetic assassin: a Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger). In the process, Reese (Biehn) and Sarah fall in love, and she later becomes pregnant with his son: John Connor. <br/><br/>The next issue is to do with the resistance movement that is given a lot of importance in the previous Terminator outings. John Connor (Michael Edwards in T2, Bale in TS) was spoken of as an extremely inspirational character. He had motivated the surviving human race against the machine tyranny. Kate Brewster, now Connor (Claire Danes in T3, Bryce Dallas Howard in TS), was painstakingly introduced in T3 as well, so one will imagine their presence in TS as potentially magical. <br/><br/>Those who are waiting to see the John Connor as prophesied in past tense statements of characters sent back in time will have to wait more because Christian Bale is not ready yet. It is always up to the Terminator (Schwarzenegger and Roland Kickinger), T-1000 (Robert Patrick), T-X (Kristanna Loken), Marcus Wright and Dr. Serena Kogan (Helena Bonham Carter) to charm the audiences. <br/><br/>Even the small fry Earl Boen gets to shine in the earlier parts, but filmmakers have still not decided what to do with Connor. Anyhow, one saving grace is that Kyle Reese stood the test of time, literally. <br/><br/>What about the lines? Schwarzenegger had a prominent accent, so his ""I'll be back"" was repeated in a different variation in each movie. Biehn's ""Come with me if you want to live"" was done by a different actor in each sequel. ""Talk to the hand"" in Terminator 3 had come about as a surprise, and it remained untouched in Salvation. Yet some questions linger with every release. Who'll be back? Who will go with whom? And who will live? <br/><br/>*** Spoilers End Here *** <br/><br/>Moving on to the technical side, sources say that The Terminator had a budget of $ 6.5 million. So it was only obvious that James Cameron had to place a write-up at the beginning indicating the events. He corrects this in the second part by actually expanding on the futuristic scenes to the extent of revealing a rugged John Connor (Edwards). Judgment Day in every way was a masterpiece. Jonathan Mostow carbon-copied the idea for T3, and there were no complaints. McG could have very well inserted Bale's voice-over to narrate the machine takeover. He could have spent extra time on the introduction of the resistance movement. One simple conversation between the rebels would have done the trick, but that was not meant to be. <br/><br/>Music Composer Brad Fiedel was a pioneer, and Marco Beltrami saluted him by incorporating the famous Terminator soundtrack into the third installment. Danny Elfman, on the other hand, delivers a fair Salvation theme that resembles The Chronicles of Riddick (2004) on some notes. What happened to the master who weaved amazing nuances for Spider-Man (2002, 2004), Hulk (2003), Men in Black (1997) and Batman (1989, 1992)? Only filmmaker Tim Burton gets the best results out of him, so let us not dwell on that. <br/><br/>What is the verdict on Terminator Salvation? The truth is I'm divided. I loved and hated it at the same time. <br/><br/>At the end of the day, this movie reminds me of the bizarre Planet of the Apes franchise spawned after the original 1968 classic. The 2001 remake was pathetic. Strangely, Helena Bonham Carter and Danny Elfman are a part of that cinematic entry too. <br/><br/>One should take a cue from J.J. Abrams whose Star Trek (2009) has a smart screenplay to back up, or cover up, an average storyline. <br/><br/>What did we learn after 11 artistes portrayed the same hero? Too many Connors spoil the franchise."
"SmakethDown638","8","3","8","22 May 2009"," Amazing
","This film was amazing. It had the feel of the chaotic future that we all envisioned. There was some great action, good acting, decent script, lots of nostalgia trips, and an overall great movie. Going into this film, I had a feeling it would be good. My expectations were simple: tons of action and let the story be told with little expectations. So ""critics"" and other reviewers didn't seem to have that. I hate the whole ""well it failed to be like T2."" Why is it when a Terminator is made, people automatically compare to the epic T2? If James Cameron was at the helm, then I can understand that thought process. It's like people are machines and are infiltrated with the thought of ""it's not like T2, must hate."" Another thing that gets on my nerves: everyone claiming there is a lack of character development. For Blair Williams, I understand that statement. However, if people complain about John Connor's character development, then some serious movie studying needs to be done. John Connor was developed in Terminator 1, 2, and 3. He was a rebellious kid, then a reluctant young adult who grows to accept his role in the Terminator Universe. How Bale portrayed him in this movie is what I expected. He was rebellious by going against Ashdown's orders. He was reluctant in that he didn't want to trust a machine. In the end, he unites the people and fights to the death! He becomes their leader. That isn't hard to understand is it? Sam Worthington was awesome. Great performance as he stole the show. People hated the opening scene of Marcus on death row. Why? It's called character development people. You complained about the lack of it and when it occurs here, people turn into hypocrites. MCG did a great job. All 3 films were acknowledged in the storytelling. A famous cameo happened. Sarah Connor's voice is heard. Sarah's picture is shown. Battles and catchphrases make you remember the first 2 films a lot.<br/><br/>One last complaint I can't stand: ""they (the machines) should have killed Reese when they had the easy chance.""Hello, Skynet captures Reese to lure Connor. Marcus' purpose is revealed in this as an infiltrator gathering targets. It is not rocket science. Great movie. Ignore the so-called ""critics."" Ignore the usual illogical haters. Ignore the negativity because this film was a HUGE positive in the series. I love all 4 films and am ready for Terminator 5!"
"btweensunandmoon","5","3","8","21 May 2009"," Very Disappointing Movie
","I think in order to deserve the honor of being known by 3 letters, you have to actually do something notable. Terminator Salvation, or T4, is definitely not that notable achievement for McG. The flaws of this movie are so numerous, it would be difficult to explain all of them with any amount of detail in 5000 words, never-mind the 1000 we are allotted in these reviews. T4 suffers from lack of plot, terrible acting, pretty bad dialog, and last but not least...over dependence on action and CG to carry the movie. If you were to watch the other movies and then this one right after it might fare better. However as a stand alone movie it fails. What makes matters worse is the movie has a very slow start. Truthfully, I nearly walked out of the theater several times during the first 45 minutes. What redeems this movie slightly is the last half which will keep you on the edge of your seat...a little. I do not think Christian Bale was the correct actor for the role of John Connor. His performance was bland and devoid of emotion. It reminded me quite a bit of how he approached the role of Batman, right down to the vocal style. The other actors were forgettable in their performances especially Bryce Dallas Howard who puzzles me with how she still gets acting gigs with lousy job after lousy job. If you are a Terminator fan, see this movie. It has enough entertainment value to last one viewing. However the average moviegoer will not enjoy this movie at all."

Christian bale seems to have been miscast, more or less reprising his role as batman/bruce wayne again. some nice action though, and i'll admit, it was cool to see terminators in the theater again. unfortunately this movie struggled at every turn to shamelessly connect itself with the previous 3 terminators, while at the same time, completely disregarding them. also, special effects were a mixed bag, most times phenomenal, at other points laughable."

","I just got back from the Thursday 12:01AM showing of ""Terminator: Salavation"", the first showing in my area, which was basically Wednesday night. So, you know that I am a fan of the series, having seen the first movie in the theaters, and all of them since, even the last, which I thought was terrible. I also watched Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles, which I had its moments and I thought generally positive of.<br/><br/>I have to say that I was disappointed in the sense that this was not really a movie in my opinion. It was an attempt to keep the Terminator franchise open for more mediocre movies, like a higher than TV quality series. There was a coldness and aloofness to this movie like the writer did not want to go anywhere near the Terminator mythology.<br/><br/>After all these renditions of Terminator, who is John Connor? Christian Bale is as serious and grimacing as Clint Eastwood, but I felt he did not bring much to the role. It was not his fault, I think there was nothing for him to sink his teeth into, because there was no movie here. It was a series of special effect ... the biggest enemy of these kinds of movies is that they are overwhelmed by their special effects.<br/><br/>In this case special effects abounded. Good ones, such as the air battles between the human jets and the terminator hunter-killers - and bad ones, surprisingly the clunk articulation of the Terminators themselves, which except for shininess were no more developed or realistic. Looking at the heads of these things, which we get many chance to do, we only see a fierce looking face, not a fully articulated mouth and jaw which would be needed for a robot to really fool humans in to believing they were real.<br/><br/>There was no mention of the liquid metal Terminator, or of time travel. At the end of the movie this ""adventure"" was spun as a battle in the ongoing war against Skynet. In other words this movie was basically a lot of bang and crash to get people to accept a movie with no heart, no point, and poor character development in the nostalgic hope that they will want to recapture the wonder of the Terminator movies and pay for more mediocrity.<br/><br/>I hate to say it, but I think this is the end for me. Hollywood is cynical and crass, and clueless when it comes to what people like and see in such franchises as Terminator, or Star Trek, or even in the blatantly stupid looking trailer I saw of Robert Downey playing Sherlock Holmes tonight in the theater before the show.<br/><br/>I honestly cannot help but think that this lack of demand for quality and obliviousness to satisfying the audience with a meaningful story that gives them something to think about longer than an explosion is due to a pathology in the American soul brought about by corporatization and commoditization of everything that has plunged us into an alienation from our own mythology and dreams into a continually distracted and manipulated consumer audience who is told what to do think and like."

","Let me start by saying that I didn't expect anything from this film, just that it won't (hopefully) suck. Guess what happened ? IT SUCKS !!! There was literally nothing exciting, thrilling or awesome about this film. When you get to the second half of the film, it looks looks like a Michael Bay film. IT'S THAT BAD !! Now let's the rant: The direction is bad, the script is horrific, the characters are really bad, every time there's action there's always a giant explosion, you couldn't care less about the characters, slow- motion sequences no one asked for, when you get to the second half there's so much action it actually becomes unbearable, stupid one- liners, awful romantic sub-plot, Christian Bale is seriously bad, two of the characters in this movie steal Arnold's two famous lines (Come with me if you want to live, I'll be back), awful shaky cam scenes, there isn't one scene you feel is interesting, there are many characters with missing background, Arnold is actually in this film (but only for the final 15 min of this piece of trash), (SPOILER ALERT) Arnold gets killed in the end, so many cheesy lines and lastly- a terrible ending."

","I had great expectations about this film being a Terminator 1 and 2 movies fan , thinking it would be much better than the mediocre ""Terminator 3"" but I was wrong because T4 is not just bad but it is also very boring.<br/><br/>I didn't like the plot that is more focused in the Marcus character than the one that we all care about which is John Connor, who in this opportunity is played by the wooden Christian Bale (I don't even like him in the Batman movies). I found the action scenes just OK, there was nothing new. The only thing I liked about T4 was the character of Blair Williams (I love her), which reminded me Sarah Connor, even though she has a limited screen time.<br/><br/>It is 2018 and the humanity live in a post apocalyptic world. John Connor is one of the leaders of the Resistance who fights against the machines from the Skynet system, but in this opportunity he will be able to meet his still teenager father Kyle Reese and Marcus a mysterious man who may help him to destroy the Skynet system or maybe not .......<br/><br/>4 starts = Boring"

","I got to see the movie last night.I didn't have much expectations from the movie and I did come out with mixed feelings.I thought the movie was made with an unclear idea.The writing and story is not upto the mark.Its tough to match James Cameron but they fell well short.<br/><br/>The movie doesn't really have a solid base but it was not boring in any means.It's the kind of movie which doesn't give anything to think about once it ends(contrary to what Mcg said) The acting was good.Christian Bale tried too hard and gives a decent performance.Bale gives a lot of credibility to John Connor.It clearly shows that he has done a lot of homework but sometimes, it's just enough if you act normally, which Bale is quite capable of.Sam and Anton were great.I don't know what Common was doing in the movie.Direction by Mcg, was not upto the terminator standards.<br/><br/>Writers have done a very bad job.Skynet looked like a sky tower controlled by some humans.Skynet's human capture zone looked more like a dance bar with inferno and dance lights.I also felt Arnold's CGI appearance was not required and the climax was intentionally made to resemble the previous films.How about some originality guys? <br/><br/>Overall, i feel the producers have gambled with a huge budget but I am sure the movie will be a success outside the US since it will be a fun movie to watch.There is no fear factor due to the PG13 rating.But I guess it should have been R.I give it a 7 out of 10 and i hope the franchise is allowed to Rest in Peace.We don't want another film unless it is made by James Cameron"
"waltham-1","7","3","9","21 May 2009"," Does exactly what is says on the tin
","I think the problem is, when you are going into this kind of movie, are the expectations of it. Nobody had any faith in the idea of McG directing the movie and then we had the trailers and every body wanted to believe it would be immense. It would be an epic. It would be this years The Dark Knight.<br/><br/>But its not. But thats not to say it isn't any good.<br/><br/>Everyone looks at the two original Terminator movies through rose tinted glasses and they are superb films that set new boundaries with film making, and rightly they should stay that way. Terminator 3 was very mixed critics wise but was very much, in many peoples opinion, the end of the franchise. However Salvation, when viewed by itself as a stand alone film, is actually very good.<br/><br/>It has a very gritty, real lighting look about it. Solid performance by all (although Worthington struggles with his American accent) and has some immense action sequences in it and the CGI - although not exactly pushing the boat out - is mixed well with the late Stan Winstons models very well. It is an excellent action film, nothing more. Which is exactly what in many respects the first two were.<br/><br/>This is not Shakespeare, its not Hitchcock or Wells; its a war film about robots hunting and killing humans in the future and when viewed like this (and viewed in a back side comforting 110 minutes) is stands as a good film that excites.<br/><br/>It does not try to copy any of its previous (although one or two traditional lines appear and the ending will raise a smile) but it stands by itself as a contiunation of the Terminator saga and at the end of the day its a damn sight better than the third installment."

","This did not feel like a Terminator movie AT ALL. Just because John Conner is here, and someone else plays a robotic person, or how the REAL Terminator made a brief appearance at the end of the film, does not make this a Terminator movie.

"BA_Harrison","6","2","5","29 July 2016"," Lacking in emotion.
","In a near-future ravaged by robots, resistance fighter John Connor (Christian Bale) searches the post-apocalyptic wasteland for teenager Kyle Reese (Anton Yelchin), the key to mankind's survival. Meanwhile, executed prisoner Marcus Wright (Sam Worthington) inexplicably finds himself both free and alive, caught in the battle against the machines.<br/><br/>There is no doubt that Terminator Salvation is sorely missing Arnold Schwarzenegger's presence, lacking the humour and personality that the Austrian action-star brings to the series. An impressive cast has been assembled to take his place, but they are no match for the man who has defined the franchise. Simply put, Arnold IS The Terminator!<br/><br/>Of course, a decent plot wouldn't have hurt either, but the fourth film fails fans in that department too, with a bland story that involves an executed criminal brought back from the dead for a chance at redemption, a narrative that lacks the efficient simplicity of the first film, nor the mind-bending complexity of the second, falling squarely in mediocre territory, with an over reliance on big-budget CGI set-pieces to drive things forward.<br/><br/>Director McG undeniably handles the action with technical prowess pulling off some stunning visual trickery, and if all you're after is an endless tirade of explosive eye-candy then you'll be more than satisfied, but as a whole the film lacks the emotional charge necessary to successfully reboot the franchise.

","It's 2016, and I just saw Terminator Salvation for the first time. I had heard so many negative comments and reviews about this movie, so I was ready for the disappointment. But I did not get what I expected after all that. It's actually a really good movie! And not only that, but it's a good Terminator movie, I would probably rank it after T2, maybe even before T1. <br/><br/>Here are the things I liked: <br/><br/>1. Christian Bale and Sam Worthington both did a really good job in their roles. <br/><br/>2. I liked the dark and intense tone of the movie. <br/><br/>3. I liked the action and most of the CG. <br/><br/>4. I liked how it was connected to the original movies (T1 and T2) in various ways. <br/><br/>5. They showed us how John Connor and Kyle Reese met; I thought that was a pretty cathartic moment in the movie. <br/><br/>6. They finally showed us how John Connor got the scar on his face. <br/><br/>7. I liked how they included ""You Could Be Mine"" in the movie. That was a funny moment, almost like a comic relief<br/><br/>One thing that comes to my mind that I thought was silly was CG Arnie. That was an unnecessary addition, the movie was good enough without that.<br/><br/>All in all, I was entertained by it. Don't expect an epic, lifechanging Terminator movie, but it's still a solid action/sci-fi film that is worthy of the franchise, definitely more than T3."
"sackingsaddict37","8","2","5","23 June 2014"," Excellent
","First off i just want to say that i have been a huge fan of this franchise my entire life, James Camerons first two films are cinematic gold!!the third installment was an absolute let down, there was no chemistry between these characters what so ever, Schwarzenegger totally slept through the role as the returning machine to protect john connor! In T2 you can feel the emotional attachment John Connor Felt toward the machine, but in 3 there is no indication of the pain he went through losing the machine at the end of T2! When John asks the Machine ""Dont you Remember Me"" And The Machine Replies "" That was a different model number"" And then Connor says "" What, do you guys come off of an assembly line or something?"" The machine says"" yes, something like that"" then he says ""Man im gonna have to re-teach you everything!"" i thought that was very cheap! there was no heart in the film what so ever! Now getting on to ""Salvation"" I personally thought this film was excellent!!They couldn't have predicted the war with the machines any better, they put you right in to the front lines against the machines with john connor leading the way, this is exactly what you were imagining watching the first 3 films, a world of fear, and pain, and unceartainty, and another great thing about this film is how it really exercises you're brain thinking about How Kyle Reese is a teenager and his Son is a thirty something leader of the resistance!! the time travel really makes you think!! Not to mention the awesome action sequences in this film!! I think Bale plays an awesome John Connor, he plays a battle hardened soldier which is exactly what connor is supposed to be in the future! And Sam worthingtons Character as marcus is a perfect addition to the story!! Very well done!!"

"hall895","4","2","5","19 January 2012"," Milking the cash cow
","When last we left this movie franchise Terminator 3, in addition to being a rather terrible movie, had rendered Terminators 1 and 2 completely irrelevant by declaring that Judgement Day and the war with the machines was inevitable. No fate but what we make? Yeah, never mind that. There is a fate and that fate sucks. So here we are in this latest movie, Judgement Day has come and gone, the world is a post-apocalyptic nuclear wasteland and the few humans left struggle in their fight against the machines. Well, if nothing else the few glimpses we got of this war in the previous movies were intriguing. Maybe they could make something out of this. No, they couldn't.<br/><br/>This movie is an example of a terrible idea even more terribly executed. The story begins with John Connor leading an assault on a Skynet base. The base gets blown up real good in a nuclear explosion. Only one person survives. Surprise! The one survivor is John Connor. Convenient. Showing no ill effects from having survived a freaking nuclear explosion Connor goes merrily about his business of being the savior of humankind. Well not so merrily actually as Christian Bale portrays Connor as the most morose, uninspiring ""hero"" anyone's ever seen. Dude's so lame you almost want to root for Skynet. Speaking of Skynet these machines apparently haven't gotten any smarter since the previous movies. They still want to kill John Connor. They still fail miserably at it. This time they have an absurdly convoluted plan involving some Terminator-ish creation of theirs. This creation is Marcus, who when we first meet him is a death row inmate about to be executed in 2003. Then he wakes up fifteen years later and...well, a bunch of nonsense happens.<br/><br/>Anyhow this new character of Marcus could have been intriguing but he got shoved aside when Bale stomped his feet like a petulant little child and insisted he play John Connor. So Connor came to the forefront and boy does the movie suffer for it. The Connor character is a dud. After hearing so much about this great leader and savior when we finally see him in action what a letdown it is. Is it Bale's performance or is it the character himself? Who knows? Whatever it is the character doesn't work. Sam Worthington, playing Marcus, certainly comes across better than Bale does but that's really not saying much. A young Kyle Reese shows up. Anton Yelchin plays that part and he probably does better than anyone else in this mess of a movie. The tough female heroine role this time goes to Moon Bloodgood. Linda Hamilton she ain't. What a horrible, horrible actress. Every time she opens her mouth you cringe. The movie also features an exceedingly pregnant Bryce Dallas Howard who gets absolutely nothing worthwhile to do. Of course the one person the movie most significantly does not feature is Arnold Schwarzenegger. Making a Terminator movie without Arnold? Bad idea. Bad, bad idea. Whatever killing machine Skynet may conjure up it ain't gonna be as cool as Arnold. And heaven knows there are plenty of killing machines, including some giant monstrosities which apparently got lost on their way to the Transformers set. All the show-off visual effects can't hide the fact that the story stinks. And after sitting through this rather awful movie, just when you think it can't possibly get any worse it does. The ending is ludicrously, absurdly, laughably bad. And you can see it coming a mile away too. I hope whoever wrote that ending had their paycheck bounce. Would serve them right. Mind-blowing in its stupidity. It's the final insult in a movie which insults the audience's intelligence as well as insulting the legacy of the first two Terminator movies everyone loved so much. Terminator 3 started this franchise down a slippery slope. This movie drove the franchise off a cliff. But as long as there is money to be milked from the Terminator cash cow you know there are more of these movies to come. Heaven help us."

","Every once in a while, a film emerges from the depths of a studio that is so original, groundbreakingly brilliant and skillfully made that it breaks all previously held conceptions about movie-making. Terminator Salvation is not any of these things. It is not groundbreakingly brilliant or likely to make a mind-blowing impact on the viewer. What it does do is provide a plausible and entertaining sequel to Terminator 2 (I refuse to believe that Terminator 3 exists – what were they thinking?)<br/><br/>The basic plot of Salvation surrounds the character of murderer, Marcus Wright. A meeting with Dr. Serena Kogan (Helena Bonham Carter) before his execution results in Wright donating his body for medical research. Unknowingly, he has donated his corpse to Cyberdene Systems who are responsible for the creation of the Skynet system. Skynet, perceiving humans as a threat to its own existence, sets out to eradicate humanity in an overly clichéd event named Judgement Day. Wright awakens in the year 2018 to discover that he is a cyborg with human organs, thus John Connor (Bale) must decide whether Wright is his enemy or part of the solution to stopping Skynets plans.<br/><br/>Salvation struggles at times to offer a fully coherent storyline and attempts to cover this by exhibiting somewhat deafening sound effects. Aside from this, the plot grows quite rapidly and at times is remarkably clever. The fourth instalment notably does very little to deepen the character of John Connor, rather it makes way for the talents of Sam Worthington as Marcus Wright. While the film lacks a certain finesse in parts, Worthington's acting manages to retain a certain glory, especially when he realises he has been tricked by Dr Kogan (Bonham Carter).<br/><br/>I found Christian Bale unsavoury, an unusual contribution from a normally ingenious actor. After his predicted success in The Dark Knight, Bale has created an expectation and calibre for his successive movies. In Salvation, he does not so much dissappoint as he does lack an expected on-screen presence.<br/><br/>Overall, Terminator Salvation is a plausible and well-conceived sequel to the first two Terminator films. There is a feeling at the end of the film that the franchise is being milked to the very nth degree as John Connor's final transmission to the Human Resistance states that the war is not over. Who knows, perhaps the next instalment will further the impact made by Salvation. In my opinion, the ending of the current release could have been tweaked to bring the franchise to a conclusion rather than leave the door to a possibly disastrous follow-up widely ajar!<br/><br/>All Rights Reserved © Copyright 2009 Michelle Lacey (Michelle Ní Láitheása)."
"chriscrits","1","2","5","22 October 2011"," So bad it hurts
","WARNING SPOILERS!<br/><br/>I had attempted once before to see this movie while on vacation in the hotel room. I paid for it and fell asleep after ten minutes, despite the loud blasting noises coming from the TV. I recently bought the quadrilogy, being a great fan of Terminator I&II, and so gave it another chance. I thought it couldn't be much worse than Terminator III, except for the fact Arnold doesn't play in it. I was wrong. This movie is so bad it physically hurts. There is absolutely no consistency with the earlier Terminator movies. It looks like the bastard child of Mad Max and Mechagodzilla. Where are the plasma weapons? Even the special effects of the original Terminator are better. The other one-star reviews have already addressed the main points, like the clichés, the bad directing, the endless chase scenes, the nonsense script... One thing that particularly hurt me was the ending. The world is at war for many years. All significant tech is controlled by machines. Katherine Brewster is a veterinarian. How in God's name are they going to perform heart transplantation in the middle of the desert????? Oh, I know. By remarkable coincidence, there is no tissue incompatibility. Also, the cyborg heart, which has suffered cardioplegy and was brought back from asystoly by electrocution with high voltage through the skin (where are the burn marks? oh right, they healed) was gifted with such awesome powers in the alternate 2003 that it is in great shape to be transplanted. They also have all necessary equipment in the middle of the desert, including a machine for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and a fully staffed intensive care unit. The major histocompatibility complexes match so great, that no supportive medication, like the high-tech dependent immunosuppressants will be necessary. Also, Dr. Brewster has acquired enough experience through daily practice at a very large heart transplantation center that the procedure is not only a complete success, but John Connor also almost immediately recovers from the 10-hour long operation as if it had been just the sewing of a minor flesh wound. I think I lost about 20 IQ points to that movie. Definitely not recommended at all."
"greywindz","Null","2","5","19 October 2011"," Save us from ""salvation""!
","Some one said, that the best way to write a negative review, is to not write at all. Movies according to me can be broadly classified in two types, thought provoking ones, and essentially timepass stuff...Now people watch this timepass movies for different reasons, primarily, no prize for guessing, to spend off-time. Some movies among them are linked with nostalgia, fond childhood or youth memories. Now among these timepass movies, many are irritating, some are annoying, most are dumb...But I never felt disgusted after watching any movie, like I did, after ""Terminator 4:Salvation"". I thought of not writing about it, but the way it jarred the foundations of my sensitive soul, I couldn't ignore. <br/><br/>These days, one is more and more noticing a trend, of breaking away, and experimenting, among the Directors. We have seen that, in the last couple of Bond movies. While being a non-conformist is good, (am not much of a tradition-ist myself) one should not experiment so much, as to destroy the essential qualities which makes the franchisee, out of the worldly, and different from the others. The raging, immortal, creative fire within the directors, however finds their first victim in the theme musics. Needless to say for those who've watched, they almost raped the theme of the Terminator. The new one was pungent, left a bad taste. But anyways, the directors are gods, we mortals, and it's their creative freedom. Next the post apocalyptic war scene. Remember the first two movies...laser guns and all? Again, experimentation is the key-word. Result, a ""Transformers"" meets ""Black Hawk Down"" meets ""28 Weeks Later"" meets ""War of the Worlds"". Terminators fought with napalm bombs, and yes...bullets. The seemingly indestructible, remorseless, pitiless, merciless, killng machines of the first two movies, destroyed by a couple of single bullet shots fired from an assault rifle, in the first scene by John Connor. Unbelievable!<br/><br/>John Connor, ""the man who taught us to fight"", the iron disciplined leader, with a humane heart. Poof! Just vanished. No traits of the previous confused but strong willed man anymore, this John Connor almost makes a round table conference with his wife, the angelically pretty Bryce Dallas Howard, (perhaps the only good thing in the movie!) before any decision. Grimy, overboiled, Christian Bale, clearly is still not out of his ""Dark Knight"" hangover, same hoarse voice, expressionless face, and needlessly loud acting. They used to do better than that in the 70's Hammer Horror movies!<br/><br/>The Terminator, who was actually supposed to be stern and expressionless, panting, raising eyebrows, twiching and curling lips, and looking among all utterly dumb. Why? Because of the terribly brainy explanation of him having a human heart along with a machine one! His human heart, allows him to grow a stubble! Again...unbelievable! Sam worthington, with a hilarious Australian accent, (Th naymes Morkos Wroight!) is the new T-600. And the Computer generated Arnold's T-800, (or was it real?), almost with a semi-comical expression...it can't get worse than this!<br/><br/>Before ending...some words of advice to the directors, fans, producers and common men like us. A terminator, a James Bond, a John Rambo, or a Rocky Balboa, is/are not just a movie/character. They are cultural icons, reflections of a fondly remembered lost time. Please don't destroy them in the name of creativity. I just wish there is some sort of a movement, a protest, or a website launch, or anything...to stop, what could be best described as cultural Blasphemy..."

The huge car and robot were awesome! 2) I REALLY liked Marcus as a character and Worthington as an actor. I felt this film was really about him, and not connor.<br/><br/>3) Set pieces were impressive What could have been improved: Actually only 2 things. 1) Christian Bale seemed to take away from the main story and the focus on Worthington's character. I just got the impression that there were close ups of him because he is a bigger star than Worthington. The film would have been a little tighter and more focused if Connor's character would have been put in the background (which is what rumor said the original script had).<br/><br/>2) There was absolutely no explanation about Kyle's character and how it fit into the story. Sorry - I saw T1 and T2 eons ago and couldn't for the life of remember why this character was so critical to the plot.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed this - a lot more than I thought I would.<br/><br/>That being said, this is a VERY different Terminator film - it stands out in many ways different than the 'franchise.'

In case you don't know who he is, he's the guy who worked his magic on the latest Batman film ensuring that you saw a ton of stuff fly across the screen but didn't see anything resembling a basic coherent plot. He's worked the same magic with this film. I imagine the planning for this movie went something like this: <br/><br/>Writer: Sure glad to have you on the team Jonathan, got any ideas for this scene? <br/><br/>Jonathan Nolan: Wow! Car goes flying across the screen, then at your face. <br/><br/>Writer: OK, and in terms of a plot? Any ideas?<br/><br/>Jonathan Nolan: Woah!

What about um, there's this cyborg OK? <br/><br/>Writer: Oh, OK go on. <br/><br/>Jonathan Nolan: And it flies across the screen at you.<br/><br/>In terms of writing, plot and depth this film feels like some fan fiction.

","OK, they DO need money, and a franchise like this called for peeling another skin off it.<br/><br/>But even with the massive basic elements, and small portions of ingredients stolen from Mad Max, Matrix, Blade Runner and who know where else, it is just junk food.<br/><br/>Epic Flaw: how on earth could a 10 storey high steel machine sneak behind a wrecked gas station in the middle of the desert so that only a mute girl can 'sense' it's there??? <br/><br/>Question Mark: why 2018?

"premium90","8","2","5","6 June 2009"," This is a good movie! Not as bad as people think!
","First thing first! I do not understand why certain critics have slated this movie and giving it a poor review. One thing people must know that this is a terminator movie and the fourth instalment. Terminator was a classic. Terminator 2 was great! Terminator 3 was OK and was really watchable. And...........terminator salvation continues the general theme.<br/><br/>No point in myself telling you the full story. This film is definitely for the cinema and the near future - bluray.<br/><br/>This movie is rather about Marcus Wright (Sam Worthington) and Kyle Reese. To be honest, John Connor (Christian Bale) plays a small part, although the whole script was re-written.<br/><br/>The question is about, who is Marcus Wright? No point telling you as this is the main intriguing part of the movie. It makes sense after the movie. The story connects all three pre-terminator films perfectly. Good job the whole ending was re-written as if you search the net about the alternative ending - you will be really angry! Anyway, not going to talk and talk as you will be able to get the drift of the story if you search google! This movie is a good action movie with stunning sound and CGI. Even Arnie looks like Arnie! Woo hoo. No way a terminator movie can be without Mr Arnie! Anyway.....great movie! Came home with a buzz after the flicks and will definitely purchase this on bluray in the future. I love the terminator franchise (excluding the TV series) and this does not disappoint! Must see. Let hope the next movie includes Arnie again! Even if he reach 70 years old etc. LOL.<br/><br/>MCG does not disappoint..... Terminator here we come!<br/><br/>MAKE THE NEXT MOVIE!!!!!!!!"

Like glimpses of what we saw with the 1st movie. 3. So many plot flaws I cant even count<br/><br/>Its just like seeing Alien and Aliens, then what do we get for waiting a very very bad 3rd movie. The kind of bad that makes you look up the director and want to send in mail of the worst kind. There are some SE that were good but come on without the rest of it we leave with disdain for the director.

","Well, for those of you who haven't yet seen the movie, I have some advice. Go without any high expectations and you may just be able to sit through the movie without cursing yourself...<br/><br/>As for the movie itself, this is one major disappointment...It had all the right ingredients..good cast, nice story line(the concept at least)and a chance to redeem the franchise after T3... But sadly, Terminator Salvation fails to capitalize on any of these....<br/><br/>The big flaw with this movie is the lack of a central leading villain...there is no one personal BAD terminator that relentlessly pursues you out there...T1 had Mr. Arnie.. T2 had Robert Patrick playing that superb bad ass T1000 liquid metal terminator..<br/><br/>and even T3 had Krista Loken as the TX<br/><br/>Unfortunately, in Terminator Salvation,all you have is Skynet and droves of nameless,faceless and relatively easily expendable terminators... Thats not what the Terminator Franchise is all about people...<br/><br/>Sure, some of you may say that the storyline doesn't allow for a single stellar terminator and some may even point to Marcus Wright( Portrayed brilliantly by Sam Worthington by the way). But thats not it..Within the same storyline you could have had a starring evil terminator...<br/><br/>Christian Bale is another big flaw...This is quite possibly his worst performance to date...He sleepwalks through the role and there is no conviction at all..not even when he says the iconic ""I'll be back""...In fact, he was so completely overshadowed by Sam Worthington that I felt he would have made a much better John Connor.....<br/><br/>To be fair, there are a few scenes in the movie which are genuinely good...but they are few and far between...This is not,I repeat,this is not a worthy successor to the Terminator Franchise...<br/><br/>Casual viewers may like this movie and that may explain to some extent the incomprehensibly high rating this movie has..But for the legions of fans who grew up on the original T1 and T2 that had a certain Mr.Arnie in it, this is one big letdown....<br/><br/>Get back James Cameron and get back Mr. Arnold..If he doesn't want to act, then you have shown us that he can be brought back to the screen with graphics..do it for the whole movie if you have to...<br/><br/>Otherwise, there is no salvation for this franchise and for the droves of hardcore Terminator fans out there....<br/><br/>Go watch this movie if you have nothing much to do over the weekend and if you are not a Terminator fan...Otherwise, its better you stay clear of this one..."
"fosterino","2","2","5","27 May 2009"," huge letdown - a far cry from the Terminator I know
","I am a huge fan of the first 2 terminator movies. I thought the third was pretty lame, especially because the end of terminator 2 makes any sequels impossible, but this takes the cake. I thought this movie was pretty boring actually, and, given my reverence for the originals, kind of off-putting.<br/><br/>The main problem is the plot. To put it plainly, it's not very interesting or exciting. This is probably because the trailers for the movie ruin the big twist that Marcus is actually a robot. Going in, I thought that because they revealed this so casually that it wouldn't have been a major plot event, but in fact it's THE major plot event and it doesn't happen until about two thirds of the way through. While I can normally accept a predictable or weak plot, I will not accept a plot that exists simply as a means to eat up minutes of screen time between action sequences, which is exactly the case here.<br/><br/>A major problem with the movie, in my view, is the way that the action exists within the framework of the movie. There is so much stuff in here that makes absolutely no sense at all. I don't mean this in the way that you might look back at a movie on the drive home - I mean that it obviously doesn't make any immediate sense. I feel like they didn't think things through all the way, and the results undermine the movie's impact. For example, Kyle Reese is apparently number 1 on Skynet's hit list, and when he is herded through a prison line, completely unaware and defenseless, he is identified by a machine and.... put in jail. You would think that ultra-precise evil robots would just kill him, especially because 1 minute before they killed some humans in the same line, but no, he has to be in one location long enough for John Connor to come rescue him. While this adds another half hour in run-time, it sure doesn't case the machines are particularly formidable opponents. <br/><br/>Another sequence that I found particularly amusing/terrible was at the beginning when JC and company need to steal some valuable files from Skynet, so they go down this huge hole in the ground, go through some sewers at the bottom, and find a single computer (because I can really imagine terminators sitting around at a laptop at the bottom of a well, or using a laptop at all), which just HAPPENS to be located directly in front of a prison with human survivors. All of this is unprotected of course, because any self respecting evil computer system that managed to wipe out modern civilization and churns out bad-ass killer robots would OBVIOUSLY do this.<br/><br/>Even beyond these structural/conceptual problems, the action itself is unimaginative. The effects are competent, but not applied creatively and the result is completely forgettable. In Terminator 1 and 2, James Cameron used the technology of the day to create effects that blow me away to this day. In T2, Arnold splits the T-1000's head in half and it instantly reforms in one shot - part of the tension of the movie was that it would keep coming back to hunt them. In this, some humans run from robots and get away, or they shoot them and the robots fall over and the humans get away. Wow! How exciting. There wasn't anything here that impressed me very much, but then again, McG is no James Cameron, that's for sure.<br/><br/>On a side note, there was some fan service in the movie that I recognized and appreciated. However, I have heard ""I'll be back,"" and ""Come with me if you want to live"" enough times in my life, thank you. I laughed out loud when a terribly animated Arnold Schwarzenegger showed up at the climax of the movie for a few seconds, presumably just because the people involved thought it would be cool and dramatic, as opposed to completely hysterical.<br/><br/>As I'm sure you have surmised by now, feel free to skip Terminator Salvation, unless you really, really, really feel the need to hear Christian Bale's batman voice one more time."
"worldpieceprod","4","2","5","27 May 2009"," Turdinator: Full Throttle
","I was excited to see this film since the trailers were excellent and made it out to be something worth seeing. Once the opening credits started, my suspicions began. The opening credits really sucked. The words ""A McG Film"" came up on the screen and the theater burst out into laughter. What kind of douche waffle names himself McG? That wouldn't even be cool if he was black let alone the whitest guy on the planet! Anyway, I can sum this entire movie up like this; A couple of above average action sequences dispersed among several below average action sequences that are over reliant on CGI shaky cam spaz vision, and endless boring cheese-drama scenes that all go on 8 minutes too long where Bale screams every single line of dialog as if everyone in the future were deaf. Plot? Not really, its so stupid you won't care and so predictable you won't need to. The casting of this film is so god awful, it never had a chance of being taken seriously. Its good to know that the post Nuclear Holocaust future will be inhabited by supermodel jet pilots, perfectly trimmed hunks, and everyone will have their hair styled. I hoped this film would reflect the dirty, gritty, future we were given a glimpse of in the first Terminator film. Instead we're given the usual Hollywood apocalypse 90210 crap bogged down in CGI hell. It spends far too much time paying tribute to the other Terminator films and thus never really finds a reason to stand on its own legs. We do get to see Terminators killing and getting killed, and for that it cannot be considered a complete loss, its no Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. However, much like the brief scene of a CGI Arnold we are forced to swallow in the end, this film ends up being a familiar skin on an empty shell. Hopefully someone will go back in time and terminate McG's mother. That would be worth watching."
"lampbizkat","1","2","5","26 May 2009"," Terminator Series: In Need of Salvation.
","It honestly almost makes me want to cry when I see a series I grew up on and idolized from my early youth literally destroyed and crushed by Hollywood's newest group of directors. It happened with the Aliens series and now it has happened with the Terminator series.<br/><br/>The question I asked myself before seeing this movie is why would executives let a director who's only directing credits are some music videos, TV commercials, and Charlies Angels take over one of the most beloved movie franchises? I was hopeful before seeing this movie that McG might pull off an upset. In interviews he seemed very knowledgeable about the series and noted he has and always will be a huge terminator fan so I figured I would give him the benefit of the doubt. After seeing the movie however; it is clear he really has no idea what he is doing.<br/><br/>After watching the film I am wondering if McG has ever seen the first two terminator films. In James Cameron's vision the post-judgment day world is dire. The world has been destroyed by Nuclear war, humans are fighting a daunting battle against an unstoppable army of machines, the skyline is dotted with crumbled sky scrappers, burnt out cars, and over passes coiled in re-bar and twisted metal however; in McG's world the post-judgment day just seems like purgatory. Apparently Skynet cannot really make that many T-600s. You only see a handful of them. I mean there are literally NO machines in this movie. You see a few T-600's and HK's but where is the army of Machine's trying to crush the resistance? McG's version of the post apocalyptic world is a bright sunny day in Arizona and the plot is full of holes. How can the resistance have a huge operating base fully manned with top notch gear and operate A-10 cobras, Ospreys, and helicopters? These require HOURS of maintenance and upkeep, not to mention fuel to keep in the air. The 'resistance' head quarters is on a submarine (sighs), and apparently Skynet only has a sentry gun and a single T-600 guarding its main base. Also I was surprised to learn that veterinarians can perform open heart surgery in the middle of the desert..lol...<br/><br/>Second whoever was the casting director should never be allowed to work again. This movie hosts some of the worst actors to ever share the screen together Sam Worthington and Christian Bale being the exception. The worst being the mute black girl. I mean please tell me what was the point of having her in this film?? She serves no purpose, is completely irrelevant to the story and is just down right annoying. Second Moon Bloodgood is gorgeous but would she really have sparkling white teeth, salon hair, and make up on if there is a never ending war with the Machines? We have yet another rapper trying his hand at acting (Common) and the dreadful Bryce Dallas Howard. They do not even utilize Christian Bale in this movie. He is barely a supporting actor. Where is his character development? That is right..there isn't any.<br/><br/>As many have said McG seems to have attended the Michael Bay/Roland Emmerich school of filming. Just have random things exploding, have a whole bunch of random and implausible chase scenes and totally ignore plot and character development. It is also obvious that McG has no original ideas because every scene he films is borrowed from another movie. It is like he tried to recreate a futuristic version of 'Apocalypse Now' but fails miserably. <br/><br/>The movie is really a strung out music video. A lot of pretty visuals and sound but nothing else there."
"ohiotrain","4","2","5","25 May 2009"," Mama never told me about days like these!
","""Terminator Salvation,"" is a film anticipated for probably over a year now, a fact that quickly undermines it's chances of being well received. But, alright then, the story about the future war between man and machine and John Conner's epic leadership of the brave Human Resistance.<br/><br/>But, it opens with a convicted killer in 2003 going to his execution, and agreeing to give his soon-to-be-dead body over to Cyberdyne Systems, represented by a cancerous Marla from ""Fight Club."" Meanwhile, in the future, Conner is realizing that the future his mother told him about, where the machines mimic humans, may be coming to life. Ah! So Conner must prevent this from happening and thats what our movie is about, right? <br/><br/>Not so much. Instead we end up being focused more on the resurrected convict who may, or may not, be a good guy. And who, may, or may not, himself, be a Terminator. Instead on spending more time following the story of John Conner played by the abrasive, but talented, Christian Bale, we follow some dude we didn't ask for, Marcus Wright, played by a guy we don't know, Sam Worthington. After conveniently going straight to a young Kyle Reese. He begins the slow process of crossing paths with John Conner. The movie seems more concerned about Marcus's plight than with Conner's, who we we thought was the real centerpiece of the story.<br/><br/>Even if you are totally obvious to this huge subplot, you are completely onto the fact that Marcus is himself a robot, or at least a partial robot. Especially seeing as he was executed at the start of the film, and has seemingly awakened unscathed in the future. Yet, for some reason, he seems completely ignorant to the fact. (Despite things like the annoying sound of servos and hydraulics coming from his body in lieu of muscles, or the fact that he now sees in infrared and bits of code... I would guess.) Yet, he continues on with few or any questions. I knew he was a robot. You will know he was robot. How did any of us know that? We were just sitting in the theater.<br/><br/>The next scene(s) involves Kyle, Marcus, an unnamed mute little girl who is their constant traveling companion, and several other Humans who are either killed, or taken hostage, by various Terminator machines. Some fly, some come in motorcycle form, while others are huge and feature gun heads.<br/><br/>At that point, let us admit something here. The inspiration for these designs came not from the previous installments, the mind of James Cameron, Industrial L & M, or even the late Stan Winston, to whom the film is dedicated. Let us be clear on the elephant in the room: obviously, the producers and robot designers here were trying to imitate Michael Bay's Transformers. They were not interested in paying any homage to the better, far more interesting characters from before, but, rather, trying to compete with Bay and to get on the side of your Taco Bell Big Gulp. Shame on them. And somebody needs to call on them for that.<br/><br/>But, I would be lying if I said the action scenes are not fun. At least director McG (Yes, that is what he wants us to call him) had the decency to not copy the Michael Bay formula of assaulting your eyes with such an orgy of explosions and action that you can't make heads or tells of whats going on. Rather, we are allowed to just watch. I appreciate that.<br/><br/>It certainly does what it intends to do here, but begins to fizzle and fall into unbelievable even more as the film progresses. What I don't appreciate is actresses who are too unbelievably attractive to be a soldier in a radiated, post-apocalyptic landscape, and the way too many convenient plot holes.<br/><br/>The film's climax in the Skynet ""central"" factory comes with the most exciting part of the film, followed by tons of disappointments. There's the utterly ridiculous scene where the main computer (?), with the face of Helena Bonham Carter, that just registers of the scale on the goofy meter. We are treated to a shot of a finished T-800 that looks like a young Arnie, only to have our excitement immediately taken away, and a boring fight scene weakly fills-in.<br/><br/>""Terminator: Salvation"" is a sometimes fun movie, but is utterly disappointing. We end up being given a story we didn't ask for, featuring characters we end up not really caring about. It does nothing to pay homage to the previous films other that what may be just tongue-in-cheek. (Would anybody really be listening to Guns n' Roses in the future?) It has countless plot holes, and leaves more questions than answers.<br/><br/>And the overacting is embarrassing. Christian Bale, seemingly a talented man, just tries to hard to go the ""intense"" route to the point that no one can relate to him anymore. And Sam Worthigton pointlessly screams more than Bruce Willis in ""Die Hard."" Robert Patrick as the T-1000, by simply basing his movements on either that of a shark or bald eagle, easily acts circles around these guys. (His reward for the role of the T-1000 was to get sloppy-seconds from David Duchovny, and to fill various go-to villain roles in bad HBO films.) The first two movies were practically iconic, and inspired a long list of knock-offs. But, ""Terminator: Salvation"" ends up sadly looking like the knock-off, and it sets its standard pretty low.<br/><br/>The first two films were practically iconic, including some of the most exciting and dynamic action scenes ever filmed. So, instead of putting down and cash to see this, I would recommend staying in and watching the director's cut of ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day"" and waiting till ""Salvation"" goes straight to the DVD bargain bin.<br/><br/>That's one future I feel safe to predict is very soon."

John Connor isn't the leader of the resistance, Kyle Reese didn't work in camps loading bodies for the machines, and Skynet isn't so much threatening as idiotically incompetent. Also, screws up direct quotes from it's preceding chapters: Sarah Connor's taped speech was obviously meant to be the one she was taping at the end of T1, but the lines in T4 were not the same lines that were on screen in T1.<br/><br/>Blech.

","I'll keep it simple. Like Aliens vs Predator, Terminator Salvation lacked the same heart and story as the originals. It also should have kept the R rating of the first two. I'm sick and tired of these crappy Hollywood remakes with no soul and spirit. Lets see some writers and directors with some balls like Christopher Nolan with Batman who can do something good with any franchise and turn it into cinematic gold.<br/><br/>The acting was dry along with the poor story and writing. The best part of the whole movie was the special effects with that alone not able to save an already bad film. In a sense the world audience pays to keep the Hollywood business alive. As a lover of film, I yearn to get a better return for the money I spend to be entertained. And lately this need is rarely meet beyond the dollar rental at redbox."

","The Terminator legacy is dying... and I say that with the utmost respect. I understand what McG was trying to do - fun summer action blockbuster - and I don't doubt that it will be one. But, it breaks my heart to see the Terminator franchise relegated to a one-trick pony. Terminator 1 and 2 was fun and broke my heart in the same moment. But this has all been lost in the last two movies. The beauty of the initial Cameron movies was the humanity. The struggle that humans had to come to grips with - knowing the full weight of the technological apocalypse, but unable to follow its logical conclusion because of its heartbreaking empathy. Please movie studios, the next Terminator franchise - find your soul - find that one heroic emblem of humanity - whether it be the strong female role fighting for her son (and not the random pregnant lady that shows up every once in a while), whether it be the machine that finds his heart (and i know our new leading terminator was aiming for that - but the trailers showed more humanity than the film), whether it be the son fighting for his mother (not a tape recorder). Don't forget that empathy and love is what ultimately rules the human heart, judgment, wallet, and critique. Bring back the soul into the franchise that has been stripped of it as cybernet stripped us of our humanity."
"eched","7","2","5","23 May 2009"," There is one reason why this film is worth your money, and only one...
","And that one reason is the Arnold guest appearance. I can honestly say I have no idea how they did that. That sure did not look like a CGI face to me and he was entered into the film seamlessly, and the five min that he is in, and terminator beat playing in the back, just made the whole film worth while.<br/><br/>Other then that the action felt like a hit and miss. Some action scenes were grade A, like this action set piece in the water and the ending fight with the T-800, while other action set pieces, like the truck scene, just seemed to drag. Maybe the adds gave to much of that scene away so it couldn't surprise me like it should have.<br/><br/>The other problem I had at least is the humans seemed to be doing to well in this war. The flash forwards in the other films showed them on the brink of death, living off of rats and pure smarts, but in this they had jets and submarines at their finger tips, and because of this I never got the feeling that man kind was a step shy of dieing out.<br/><br/>Still, none the less the characters were well done, and when an action scene does get hit right, it goes out of the park.<br/><br/>The lowest in the series, but still a good part to the series.<br/><br/>PS. The PG-13 doesn't hurt the film at all. All the blood that was needed was in it. Adding any more would have just seemed forced."

","I have always been a huge terminator fan and always thought the future scenes were some great parts in the first and second of the series. So when I found out they were making one that was set during the war and that Christian Bale would be playing John Connor this became the movie that I was most looking forward to for the summer. The movie was going very well but went downhill every minute. There are numerous plot holes throughout the movie where the machines make terrible choices one after another for no reason other than to keep the movie going. This to me is just unimaginative writing. Skynet becomes like the Austin Powers character Dr. Evil, where instead of just destroying John Connor or Kyle Reese, it makes up an elaborate plot to kill them. I wish Skynet had a son like Dr. Evil who would just say ""I have a gun in my room, let me go get it and we'll kill him right here"". I think the cast did the best with what they were given but McG and the writers failed to deliver a great story, but instead just gave us some great special effects to try to overshadow the fact that the plot had more holes than swiss cheese. So in the small hopes that James Cameron might come across this message board PLEASE TAKE THIS SERIES OVER AGAIN, WE NEED YOU."

","Terminator Salvation is currently sitting at 34% on RottenTomatoes.com. I just don't get it. When it comes to films, I am very hard to please. I'd say out of every fifteen movies I see I would only describe one as a 'good' movie, and even less as a 'great' one. But Terminator Salvation suited me just fine. It's engaging, interesting, well-directed, and at moments surprisingly emotional. Of course it pales in comparison to Terminator 1 and 2, but that's James Cameron for you. I found it to be fathoms better than the abomination on film: Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines. Terminator Salvation had incredible visual effects, preferring to film on real sets rather than extensive green screens and using real helicopters and cars over computer generated replacements, and opting to film Animatronics over CG models. The effect is quite endearing as we movie goers have been bombarded with cheesy CG effects since 1995. (I nearly wanted to gouge my eyes out at the giant CG Sandman in Spiderman 3 or CG baby in Children of Men). The story is straightforward, incorporating elements and themes ever so subtly from previous James Cameron films. Overall, I'd say the movie delivers. Definitely worth your admission price. I plan to buy it and add to my Terminator DVD collection (something I have not and will not give the privilege to the steaming pile that was Terminator 3). I'd say the fair score on rotten tomatoes should be a 69%. Maybe with more time and reviewers, the film will get the buzz it deserves."
"dpuczek","Null","2","5","22 May 2009"," Entertaining but Flawed in Many Ways...
","This new Terminator installment falls third in the four movie line up. It plays homage to the first three in a variety of subtle ways, which is good, but fails to provide the ""realism"" inherent in at least the first picture. While the second was truly an action flick, the third was a campy outing not worth mention. Terminator Salvation (TS) tries to play up the futuristic parts we got a taste of in the previous films but doesn't really carry it well enough.<br/><br/>For whatever reason, Arnold's T-8000 in part one could shoot up every cop in the police station, on target. In TS, the T-700 terminators here are armed with friggin miniguns and cannot hit the broadside of a barn. For whatever reason, these T-700's were also designed as 7-foot tall killers which goes against Kyle Reese's description in Terminator of them looking like humans but having rubber skin (""We spotted them easily"").<br/><br/>Sam Worthington is ""okay"" as the new terminator, though a bigger glimpse into his transformation process from executed killer to new terminator would have been nice. We can also do without the burgeoning love affair between the hot female A-10 pilot and Worthington - this felt forced and misplaced in every sense.<br/><br/>I didn't appreciate applying a face to Skynet either - this being Helena Bonham Carter. Skynet is a computer through and through, and it doesn't need to explain its evil ways to one of its creations (Worthington) ala Dr Evil in Austin Powers.<br/><br/>We really have no developed feel for anyone of our characters. Christian Bale doesn't reach the deepness he provided in Batman Begins. In fact, I thought this movie would have been more along those lines but it hardly was. Despite him catching a metal rod through his chest, this bloke survives long enough to talk to people, smile, push a detonator and ultimately accept Worthington's still human heart.<br/><br/>Kyle Reese's first attempt at ever driving a car - this an open-topped jeep - makes him look like a trained professional stunt driver. Worthington should have already been behind the wheel here.<br/><br/>The mute little girl didn't serve much purpose after the mid-way part of the film. Bryce Dallas Howard wasn't much of a presence either.<br/><br/>The giant ""Transformers"" human collecting robot seems misplaced here. Like they needed a towering ""WOW"" factor so they through it in. How can these resistance fighters never sense when this huge beast and it's accompanying dropship are arriving? Why do the resistance fighters operate on the surface in broad daylight with little or no fear of being detected? Where are the Hunter-Killers at this point? Why did they amass a collection of A-10 Thunderbolts, Ospreys and Huey helicopters and no F-22 Raptors or F-15 Eagles? What happened to all of our tanks and artillery systems? Where are the laser rifles we see in Kyle Reese's versions of the future? Bale and his compadres all love using the modern M4 Carbines and sidearms for budgetary purposes I suppose.<br/><br/>Lastly, I feel this film should have gone for the R-rating. The Terminator series is deserving of it. The subject matter requires it whether you like it or not. The future is suppose to be ugly and violent and to go the PG-13 route here does the series a low blow.<br/><br/>This movie could have been something special but it let down the first two in the series while bettering only the third installment. Too bad :/"

Great performances from the majority of the cast, especially Worthington(who outshines a mean, moody Bale),who will soon be a mega star and a rousing soundtrack by Danny Elfman help make this not only a must see Summer blockbuster, but a superb sci-fi/action/horror film in it's own right.<br/><br/>A word of warning, though, the movie is VERY dark.Those looking for the humour of T2 or T3 will be sorely disappointed.This is, after all, a post-apocalypse world we're seeing!

It had real potential, with a great logical extension of prior plotlines that could have elevated the franchise further into new territory. But the entire franchise has been robbed of its soul ever since the 3rd installment. So rather than really exploring all of the many interesting questions raised by the story (as Judgement Day and even the original did so well), what we get is a cheap knockoff that tries to rely on the established lore and world its set in to carry it, but without really working to flesh out that world any further. It seeks to take, and gives nothing back.<br/><br/>All that's left is a hollow shell of what used to be a great story (and could have been again). Ironically, the franchise itself has taken on a life of its own and is now little more than a money-making, well, MACHINE. If you're looking for any kind of humanity, look elsewhere, because Salvation is an empty experience disguised by a cheap facade that half-heartedly attempts to evoke the story the originals."

","I believe it's the third time I'm watching this movie. I'm not familiar with McG's other work, but this one is very impressive - good solid direction (with some original ideas, like the one long take in and out of the helicopter), fantastic almost-flawless CGI and animatronics, excellent sound editing, cinematography, stunts, makeup and score by Elfman. Pretty decent script with some original ideas.<br/><br/>The movie is not without flaws - and it's not ""Terminator 1"" or ""Terminator 2"" - but it's pretty good on its own.<br/><br/>Bryce Dallas Howard (daughter of actor/director Ron Howard) is beautiful but simply a terrible actress.<br/><br/>I don't understand how the awful 'Terminator 3"" is considered better than this one and can't believe that after this wonderful sequel they still haven't greenlighted part 5."

","In 'Terminator: Salvation', the focus is once again on the battle of man vs. machine, but in truth the real fight here is art vs. commerce. In Hollywood, commerce always wins.<br/><br/>Already unnecessary in almost every possible way, hack director McG's 'Salvation' is not unlike the machines that populate its world; Technically impressive, but cold and incapable of an original thought. The story lacks the big, well developed themes that were the foundation of Cameron's two classics, and the cast all seem to be going through the motions, knowing in their hearts that this is nothing more than a simple cash grab.<br/><br/>'Terminator' 1 and 2 serve as an excellent duology.

"OllieSuave-007","6","2","6","18 May 2014"," The Terminator trilogy barely salvaged.
","The fourth film in the Terminator trilogy barely salvaged the series, a story that continues where Skynet has wiped out much of humanity during a nuclear holocaust. However, a group of resistance members led by John Connor (Christian Bale) attempts to to keep the machines from destroying mankind completely by pitting an all-out assault on them.<br/><br/>Fresh off his Dark Night role, it was nice seeing Christian Bale back in action again, pairing up with another action star, Sam Worthington, in which the two I thought make a great team together. There are some intense action and cool special effects that highlight an exciting battle between the Resistance and the Machines. The war-torn atmosphere gives you a dark and somber feeling of Skynet's action which captures the overall desolation and calamity of the incident, but also provides a clear backdrop for the determined Resistance members to carry on their mission. <br/><br/>The plot and story were entertaining mostly, helped by the non-stop action and a nicely assembled cast of characters. But, the script does lack the suspense, drama and dry humor found in the earlier Terminator films with Arnold Schwarzenegger in it. It is basically another simple chapter in the series with no unique storyline; however, I do prefer this film over the Terminator 3 because ***spoiler ahead*** it is not anti-climatic. While the ending does give you a hint that the trilogy continues, there are few plot threads to leave you have hanging thoughts after the credits role. <br/><br/>Overall, Terminator Salvation is a lot of sci-fi action fun that is more entertaining than Terminator 3, but doesn't surpass the quality and captivation of the first two Terminator films. <br/><br/>Grade C+"

","I loved T1. Brilliant movie with a great universe. T2 was good as well, with some new breakthrough effects and still the 'great' acting of Arnold. T3 was an insult to the series and should have been cut down to a 20 minute intro to T4. Ever since I saw Terminator for the first time, I was waiting for a Terminator film that would show us how it was to live after judgement day. When T3 came, everybody thought that they were gonna see bleached skulls with giant robots driving over them and hunting down mankind. Everybody got disappointed.<br/><br/>Terminator Salvation delivers everything we have been waiting for since Kyle Reese had flashbacks to the future in 1984 when the first Terminator was released. This movie has the perfect plot. I don't have to explain it, as everybody who has seen the Terminator movies will know what the plot is. Special effects, acting, screenplay, storyline...

","Hollywood logic: to fight an army of T1000 (too expensive to feature in this movie) you also need an army of shape-shifters. This way Connor and Reese can and should change in time both in size and also the face, after all the human resistance is some sort of Witness Protection System - we've all seen Arnold locate someone by the picture alone. And if Batman changed bodies from one movie to another so does J Connor.<br/><br/>And it keeps getting better and better. At least better than Alice in Wonderland. This is the Candy land. Where you don't have oil extraction facilities, no refineries, yet gas is everywhere. There are no factories around, yet everybody has a high-caliber gun, proper gun training and a little bit of sharp-shooter classes. There are no fields and the land is at least as poisonous as now, yet hunger is unknown. And the resistance is multiplying like rats in order for the machines to kill at that rate. Eh, in this fairy-tale land even terminators seem easier to terminate although they are larger than the models than can travel through time.<br/><br/>Bottom line I guess the only reason why a resistance composed only of half-wits survives is because of outsourcing. That't right, outsourcing. The sensors clearly are calibrated in feet and inches and the software works in centimeters. That would explain for the tracking capabilities of the machines.

"agsconnolly","5","2","6","20 June 2009"," Some great effects, but this isn't Terminator
","As someone who is a big fan of the first two films and certainly not disparaging of the third, naturally I was looking forward to the fourth instalment in the Terminator series. Of course, I had my reservations when I saw it was to be directed by someone with a made-up name whose greatest achievement to date was the Charlie's Angels films, and that the key catalyst of the previous three (Arnold Schwarzenegger) would not feature. And, it seems, those reservations were well founded.<br/><br/>Firstly, let's get some things clear: I like Christian Bale a lot and think he is a superb actor. I also think some of the special effects/CGI in this film are as good as I've seen. And I think the film-makers have been very creative with some of the variances of Terminators and Hunter Killers on show. However, for some reason, Terminator Salvation is scripted as some kind of brain-dead action flick rather than the intriguing science fiction which is prevalent in the first three. Character development is pretty much ditched in favour of cheap story links and lame references to the existing franchise, while the action sequences, whilst entertaining, are rarely fully explained and often interrupt any semblance of plot which might be developing.<br/><br/>Bale himself is intense and tough as the iconic John Connor, but we are told very little about how he went from hiding in a Presidential bunker with Kate Brewster in Terminator 3 to being the god-like leader of the resistance. Speaking of which, the character of Brewster is developed even less, and is purely used as a very superficial love interest for Bale. Similarly confusing is the portrayal of Kyle Reese, here depicted as a scrawny street dweller with a small, mute black child as a sidekick (presumably for tokenism, he has no relevancy to the film whatsoever). Again, we have no real idea how this character became the Kyle Reese we see in the first film, which is surely one of the main objectives of Terminator Salvation - or it should be.<br/><br/>And then there is the character of Marcus Wright, who is essentially the lead role. We see at the beginning of the film that he donated his body to Cyberdyne Systems for research and was eventually re-invented as a prototype for a new type of Terminator. Wright believes himself to be human however - a twist that is never fully explained - and this creates much conflict between himself, the resistance and the enemy Skynet. Whilst it's a reasonable idea, it simply isn't interesting enough to carry the film, and the ludicrous relationship that develops between Wright and a female member of the resistance is alarmingly cheesy.<br/><br/>With regards to the effects, some of these are truly awe-inspiring - particularly a helicopter crash that Bale suffers near the start of the film, and some of the battle scenes involving enormous Hunter Killers. There is a flaw though in the way that the Terminators themselves are depicted. The androids that roam the streets picking off members of the resistance are certainly frightening enough, but do not resemble the T-600 models described by Kyle Reese in the first film, an error which I expect is deliberate to make the newly developed T-800 models (Schwarzenegger's character from the previous films) appear far more advanced and threatening.<br/><br/>But the main problem with this film is that it is not, in any real sense, a Terminator film. All the previous three were synonymous with a chase element, and the near misses that went with it. There is none of that in this film, and it appears as almost a snapshot of the war with Skynet, rather than the beginning or end. Pretty much all the previous threads and possibilities that were created in the franchise have been done away with and a banal plot, a poor script and a frankly nauseating finish have been thrown together together to make an action film for the masses, rather than a satisfactory new chapter for the fans."

","When I first read that another Terminator movie was in the works, this one set after Judgment Day, I was as excited as a kid in the candy store. Yes, T3 wasn't the best of the trilogy, but it at least closed that particular chapter of the series. Thus, I sat in line at the theater Friday night with great anticipation.<br/><br/>Imagine my dismay two hours later when I found myself trying to concoct what the plot of the movie was.<br/><br/>Visually it is spectacular as one would think it would be. Looking beyond that, gaps begin to appear the movies facade which eventually bring the movie crumbling to the ground.<br/><br/>There was little focus on the characters and the overall development which is a disappointment considering the few shining aspects of the film consisted of the performances of Sam Worthington and Anton Yelchin.<br/><br/>Terminator Salvation is the equivalent of a Michael Bay film, full of visual splendor, but falling flat in mental enjoyment. In fact, Bay's films have the further benefit of witty dialogue, an attractive female counterpart and a somewhat enjoyable story. This movie has none of those redeeming aspects.<br/><br/>One also questions the logic behind making Kate Connor pregnant if it is not acknowledged in anyway. Or the fact they pushed that 'The War will end' when anyone familiar with the series knows it goes on for at least another decade.<br/><br/>In essence, the movie is a $200 million, 2 hour setup for a future trilogy. And it is that which is the most disappointing because the overall premise of the movie is entirely brilliant. Actually watching it, though, will leave you nothing but frustrated."

"thewoodmeister","5","1","2","6 November 2019"," Terminator Salvation oh what could have been!
","It's such a shame because on paper this could have worked, and you really want to praise them for trying something new, especially in the absence of Arnold and all the cast we've been familiar with. Christian Bale is the grown up John Connor and is fighting against Skynet. We know this story and it's nice to be finally seeing it, it's starts out strong. We get to see John Connor doing the stuff we've only really heard about or seen glimpses of. We also get to meet a younger Kyle Reese, great casting there too, I also love the scene with the rubber Terminator.<br/><br/>Tonally the film has some of the grit of the original which is welcome to see, we're in a post apocalyptic world and there's definitely a Mad Max vibe. There's some new ideas thrown in here two, with different futuristic machines, the motorcycles were cool as well as the large harvester... I liked that whole scene.<br/><br/>That's the big problem for me with this film, there's some great scenes that are poorly stitched together. Weaving them together is this other story about Marcus Wright, who's a hybrid human Terminator or a Terminator who think he's human or something like that. Sam Worthington turns in a fine performance but there's something missing for me here.<br/><br/>Do we need more exploration of what it means to be human vs a machine? It's certainly in there... or would the whole story be better without this distraction? I'm inclined to go with the latter if I'm honest. This should have been the John Connor becoming the leader of resistance story that we all wanted to see on screen. I guess the filmmakers were worried that might have not been enough and wanted some twists and surprises. I think if they'd have just given us what we wanted we'd have been better off. Then there's the T-800, on screen for 5 seconds and the worst cgi since the Rock in the Scorpion King. That's worth knocking 2 points off alone.<br/><br/>Should you see this movie? Yes, I think it's worth a watch out of interest alone, it certainly stands out from the other Terminator films, but not always for the right reasons. It's a shame as now that Dark Fate has taken us in a different direction, this (and parts of Genisys) are as close as we're ever going to get to the ""John Connor"" future war that we glimpsed in the 1st Terminator."

The post-apocalyptic world is beautifully rendered in grayscale, imparting a sense of doom and gloom. The battles are well-choreographed, and the CG effects commendable. The attack drones are believable, and we've gotten used to the terminators.<br/><br/>Acting's pretty good for a movie that's action-oriented. Christian Bale acquits himself well as the anguished and jaded John Connor, Sam Worthington puts in a commendable performance as the tortured and confused Marcus Wright, and Anton Yelchin is excellent as a young Kyle Reese caught in the middle of a war.<br/><br/>Even though the action seldom lets up and the movie intersperses only short dialogue and development scenes between all the action sequences, I still felt there were some which weren't necessary as they did little for the plot. Why have a topless scene in the rain and introduce sexual tension at that moment? It did nothing for the movie. And some of the dialogue was so cheesy they belonged to the original Terminator movie. You also can't help but wonder at some of the unexplained logic lapses - like how an advanced Skynet can't intercept radio communications or take control of the human's machines. Or how the machines have such lousy aim even with advanced targeting systems and rapid-fire weapons. And I thought only movie humans delayed the death of their number one enemy.<br/><br/>Despite all this, it is still an enjoyable ride as the story unfolds to its conclusion."

Should you have seen any of the previous films, this one takes place primarily in the future, post-judgement day. <br/><br/>However, rather than reference James Cameron's previous efforts, or the dour note of what a post-apocalyptic USA would be, the director chooses a light/bright (somewhat blunt) reflection of the current Afghan landscape and attempts to juxtapose this with the manufacturing plant of the terminators. <br/><br/>All this proves is a complete lack of respect/knowledge of the original -vision of James Cameron - namely a blue-lit, oppressive, violent and futuristic society (they fired lasers after all). All we are presented here with are barren sand lands and occasional bursts of gunshots from the resistance and the terminators; completely contradicting the previous films.<br/><br/>Additionally, the movie tries to introduce a new terminator. Spoilers withstanding, this does not only contradict previous films, but also questions why Skynet produced inferior terminators. <br/><br/>Finally, the entire continuity is destroyed by Skynet knowing who John's father is at the time this takes place. Think about it, if Skynet knew who John Connor's father is, then surely it would have made more sense to kill HIS father/mother rather than John Connor's following the introduction of time travel to the saga.<br/><br/>The more I think about it, the less I like the Terminator saga - give me T1 and T2 only, and I'll be a happy bunny."

","When they announced this sequel, I was so excited! I loved Terminator 1 and 2. I even liked 3, but it was nowhere near the level of the others. Still fun, moved the story along, a great ending with judgment day finally happening.<br/><br/>My excitement grew even more learning that it was set in the future with people like Christian Bale, Sam Worthington, Conrad Buff, Shane Hurlbut, and others helping out. McG was an interesting choice, wasn't too confident about him. Watching the behind the scenes, gave me a little more confidence in him because of his huge passion for the movie.<br/><br/>I finally got to watch the movie and I was conflicted. I loved that it was set in 2018 because it was the future but not the one we were used to. T600s were more popular. There were a few new Terminators in this one that really increased the threat for the remaining humans: hydrobots, aerostats, mototerminators, harvesters. The look and design of this movie was fantastic. I loved the silver tint, the sets, the terminators, the costumes. The action was pretty wild! Connor and co invading the Skynet base in the beginning and the Harvester/mototerminators sequence rocked.<br/><br/>The acting ranged from really good to decent. Anton Yelchin was a fantastic Kyle Reese! I really believed that he was a younger version of Michael Biehn's famous character. Sam Worthington was mysterious, tough, sympathetic, awesome! Wished we knew more about him. Christian Bale was a hardcore John Connor. Definitely a different version than the past few but I liked him. The scene where he sees the prisoners and the speech about his mother (Director's cut) showed his humanity. I also cared when he got tossed around by the Terminator at the end. His voice was similar to Batman's but that didn't bother me that much. Bryce did a pretty good job as Kate but her role wasn't big enough. Her pregnancy was also never addressed, not a good idea. Moon Bloodgood was a tough gal but her acting wasn't really that amazing and her romance with Marcus was silly. There were some sweet nods to the older films that I liked, including a cameo by a cgi/body double Arnold that was pretty neat. Surprise, Helen Bonham Carter was in this and no Tim Burton! She is always wonderful.<br/><br/>Now, this movie was set during the brink, but I never really got a feel for how desperate things were. Not enough suffering and death, especially in the camps. The way Kyle described it was way more intense and scary. There also wasn't enough Resistance vs. Skynet battles. I wished they provided more info on Marcus, addressed Kate's pregnancy, explained how Skynet knew about Kyle Reese, better writing/acting. The score wasn't so bad I thought, considering Danny Elfman scored it. That's not a dig at Danny, just never thought his style would have worked for this kind of movie. Interesting ending, though not the one they originally planned.<br/><br/>I liked Terminator Salvation, the idea/concept, and most of the execution. Some things weren't that great, could have been better, more explanation, maybe some scenes bringing us up to speed from when Judgment day happened and all these years later, but this was a welcome addition for me as it changed up the formula and the setting. I hope the next two planned sequels can improve on this one. Bring on the future war but don't forget about the characters!"
"breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com","8","1","2","31 December 2012"," Better than what people say it is
","Some viewers have bashed director McG for taking on this project. First, for any director that takes on a big franchise, it is a big job. That kind of thing comes with the territory. Being a director is a big job anyway. And because of that, I give a lot of credit to McG who did what he could to make the fourth Terminator installment the best it could be; even without Mr. Schwarzenegger, physically in the picture that is. Believe me, it could have been worse.<br/><br/>Terminator Salvation (2009) takes place after Skynet wiped out more than half of the human population. Christian Bale stars as the prophesized John Connor, leader of the rebel alliance. But before any of this even happens, the story focuses on a less noted individual. Marcus Wright (Sam Worthington) is a wrongly convicted felon and has received the death penalty but is soon reborn for strange reasons several years later during the time of John Connor's leadership.<br/><br/>As Wright looks for answers, he runs into Kyle Reese (Anton Yelchin), John Connor's father, but he doesn't know the significance of that, until later. But when Skynet captures Reese, Wright tags along with Blair Williams (Moon Bloodgood) who brings him to rebel headquarters. Meanwhile, John Connor struggles to convince head of command General Ashdown (Michael Ironside) not to attack Skynet too quickly. As things start to move quicker, these two stories will collide to create some solid entertainment.<br/><br/>McG's ability to display realistic aftermath scenery is downright eerie but convincing. A lot of the sets he used were real, as were the explosions. What I liked best about McG's vision of the future is the difference between all the modified terminators from the past three films and the predecessors used here. The T-600 is terrifyingly massive. What made up for less intelligence, is a big, hulking exoskeleton and a rapid fire minigun. Then there are the moto-terminators with a slick body style, which are carried on the harvester, another gigantic deadly Skynet robot.<br/><br/>The other two Skynet robots that are new to the screen, are the hydrobots and the enlarged H.K.s. What's interesting is to see Skynet's initial ideas come to fruition and to see what their first killing machines looked like and the evolution from the beginning, to the T-X. One the best looking set pieces was the terminator factory. To see the difference between cleansed, sanitized Skynet compared to the grungy, oil-slicked terminator factory shows that Skynet isn't all chrome either.<br/><br/>Danny Elfman's soundtrack to this terminator film is not only better than Beltrami's from 2003 but it's also more involving. Elfman likes to use a lot of strings and brass in his music and that creates a sense of scope of the story. The opening theme is great. The things I didn't enjoy were minimal. I didn't understand why Christian Bale was stuck in Bruce Wayne mode and talked with a scratchy voice. I think he could have come up with some other interpretation for the character. Also the fact that this movie was PG-13 annoyed me. The same went for RoboCop 3 (1993). It should've been kept rated R. the world of John Connor isn't just for teenagers.<br/><br/>Although not many people were fond of McG's look at the latest terminator film, it is still high quality entertainment. The special effects, set pieces and music by Danny Elfman are as fresh as can be."

","I went into this movie with an open mind.""Terminator 3:Rise of The Machines"" was criticized a lot,but it was a good action film,so I had hopes for ""Salvation"".Plus,it should have been good,because the people who made this,seem to have gotten what the people's main problem with ""Rise of The Machines"" was-the tone wasn't serious enough.""Terminator:Salvation"" it seems,tries to keep a serious tone,but that greatly backfires.Why?Because the movie is nothing more than a poorly constructed amalgamation of action clichés.<br/><br/>The characters are painfully underdeveloped.The scenes,where there should have been character development are cut short.It's like,one character starts a conversation,then there is silence,then the scene cut's away.It's like they cut out parts of the scenes.<br/><br/>The next major problem this movie has is the dialog.Sometimes it's written really stupidly,other times it's incredibly cliché.At some points there are awkwardly long pauses and sometimes the scene cuts away for no reason,as I mentioned above.Some of the acting is downright horrible.Although I haven't watched any of the Batman movies,I can tell that Christian Bale seems to have forgotten,that he is not in a Batman film.<br/><br/>The action scenes are inferior to the previous films and the CGI doesn't seem to help much,either.One major disappointment for me,was that there was no distinct villain,as each of the previous films had one.The T-800 appears for about 10 minutes and does pretty much what all the terminators have done until that point.Skynet appears for a brief time and also,it doesn't do much.<br/><br/>The part where Skynet talks to Marcus is actually not that bad and it made me think,that the ending was going to be good,or at least decent,but alas,there was a major plot hole,that ruined it all.How could have the T-800 survived being covered in molten metal.Plus,it's the alloy they make the terminators from,so I assume you require a higher temperature to melt it,than regular steel,but the T-1000 died after getting dropped in molten metal,that was not in the future and it was a more advanced model.To make matters even worse,the movie ends with one of the biggest clichés ever.<br/><br/>""Terminator:Salvation"" lacks any of the qualities of the previous films and was a major disappointment for me."
"PhoenixElite","6","1","2","17 December 2012"," Untapped potential
","I have never been a big fan of the Terminator series. Though I've always admired the inventive story-line (namely in the first two films), the movies themselves have never really appealed to me. I decided to rent Salvation and give it a shot despite the mostly negative reviews I've seen on-site. The result was a fairly high-paced and entertaining film with no real highlights. I believe Salvation had the potential to be great (though admittedly I hold high hopes for most post-apocalyptic films), but it didn't quite exploit it.<br/><br/>The script is mediocre, though not atrocious, with predictable and often banal dialogue. Tributes to previous entries in the Terminator series seemed somewhat strained and incongruous, but otherwise satisfactory. The acting was reasonably good, though Christian Bale's one-dimensional rendering of John Connor was a bit sub-par. Sam Worthington was the sole exception, with a strong and emotional portrayal befitting his character. Moon Bloodgood played her part well, though sometimes the damsel-in-distress cliché clashed with the toughened soldier she attempted to depict. The scenery was great, properly illustrating a spread-out human race trying desperately to resist the growing threat and near-absolute dominance of Skynet.<br/><br/>But alas, Salvation ends up feeling like a missed opportunity. The plot feels contrived and weak, and I often found myself wondering why I felt bored during what were supposed to be action-packed sequences. The fact is, there's barely any suspense in the film to keep up the pace, and if it weren't for Worthington, I honestly wouldn't have minded turning off the film without watching the ending. In the end, Salvation is a film that packed a lot of promise, but ultimately ends up feeling like an entertaining flick which could have been much, much more."
"Bezenby","5","1","2","6 August 2012"," Loads of noise, but don't study the plot!
","I'm a bit hard of thinking, so I was trying to get my head around the whole concept of robots that are programmed not to kill people whom they're supposed to kill by Skynet, who somehow created itself but wants to kill the guy who might destroy them, but somehow created itself in the process. That Skynet must be a really smart programme, because it sure bamboozled me with it's crazy scheme!<br/><br/>Luckily I could get back to mindlessly drooling and watching loads of stuff explode. Just wait till Christian Bale turns up with a jaw set so square you could crack walnuts in it. He's out to save Kyle Reese, and I'll be honest here and say it took a few minutes to remember who he was. That doesn't matter though, because if you start analysing this film, your gonna be really confused. There's loads of robot action to keep you mind off of things, so don't worry too much. <br/><br/>This film isn't all about making grand artistic statements. It just lots of noise and stuff. If you find yourself getting a bit upset about it, then you might want to go back in time and sort yourself out a bit before bleating about what's 'canon' and what not."
"gwnightscream","5","1","2","22 June 2012"," ""Not Bad Sequel!""
","Christian Bale, Sam Worthington, Anton Yelchin, Moon Bloodgood and Bryce Dallas Howard star in this 2009 sci-fi sequel. This sequel takes place in 2018 after a nuclear holocaust due to company, Skynet. John Connor (Bale) is now a soldier in his 30's who leads a group of survivors. After an unsuccessful mission to destroy Skynet, He meets a man who has become a cyborg, Marcus (Worthington) and a couple rebel fighters, Blair (Bloodgood) and Kyle Reese (Yelchin) who is his father. After Kyle is captured by a machine, John and Marcus attempt to rescue him shutting down Skynet and it's deadly machines. Howard plays John's wife and doctor, Kate and Michael Ironside (Top Gun) is also featured. This isn't a bad sequel and Christian is good as John. I still recommend this."
"julia-rabbitts","7","1","2","30 April 2012"," Good and yet something much better could be in there
","Let's start with the basics, if you watch the Terminator movies just for large machines blowing up and smashing other machines then this film is excellent.<br/><br/>But ... if having watched the others you've realised that there is a fascinating study of what is the difference between a man and a machine and what does it truly mean to be the former then I think someone accidentally deleted all the key bits of the script in favour of another explosion.<br/><br/>Christian Bale and Sam Worthington are good actors and both can show emotions beautiful in a restrained, understated sort of way. Here there are really only 2 or 3 scenes where they almost get the chance to explore the deeper meanings, and then the director must have got bored and decided that more than 10 seconds without an explosion was too long.<br/><br/>Marcus's confusion at the beginning is matched by ours, which works well as a way into the film and the interaction with the young Reese is good but please couldn't he have been allowed to react when his part in the plot is explained by Skynet.<br/><br/>And at the end, there is no true explanation of the sacrifice as there is in Terminator 2. It's rather sad really because this could have been so much better."
"matthew-17-721107","8","1","2","8 June 2011"," This did not deserve the criticism it got!
","Why Terminator: Salvation was so criticized is a mystery to me. It's a ripping action film, very well made, strongly acted and surprisingly - McG's direction is slick, fast-paced and very loyal to the franchise. Arnie's presence was not missed - and let's face it, he didn't save Terminator 3 from being corny and soft - in fact he ADDED to it.<br/><br/>Sam Worthington was very impressive as Marcus, and although Conner's role was not very interesting, Bale's performance was solid and delivered with conviction. Perhaps if the story was more layered and there were more 'character' moments the film would've felt deeper. This was why T2 was so memorable, because it had a very deep soul. But SALVATION is a much shorter film - and McG is not Jim Cameron, so it was never going to beat T2.<br/><br/>The action scenes are terrific and exciting with McG showing off his ability to stage long takes instead doing a Michael Bay - CUT, CUT, CUT, CUT - CUT! The whole movie is very gritty and feels realistic - very little green-screen work.<br/><br/>Overall, its not as satisfying as the first 2 Terminator films, but for a fun-filled action fest and a nod to the original films, T4 is a worthy addition to the franchise. I was personally disappointed that McG wasn't going to make the other two Terminator films he had planned.<br/><br/>Such is the power of bad publicity and poor reviews. No wonder I resent the film critics."
"ANGEL-S","6","1","2","16 March 2011"," T2 Clone
","This title comes after massively disappointing T3 sequel, so my expectations were pretty low. I knew it is hard to surpass T2 that was ahead of its time on many levels. The main reason I gave it 6 is because the story structure was a direct copy of T2, as if directors and scriptwriters did not wish to take any risk with the old T2 public, yet they seek to appeal to the new generations at the same time. The story is progressed in the same way T2 does: naked terminator, the scene with clothes, truck and motorcycle, skynet destruction... Only the players and the story are subtly different, and not at all original (already seen for example in Battlestar Galactica 2003 and Matrix). We see some new elements that fill the gap between T2 and present, but again, its all seen in recent movies and TV shows in a much greater detail, so no surprise there. The acting is alright for an action movie, but the characters are there simply to fill a role, there isn't any depth, any insight how they survive without food and water, how they socialize as a primal human need after food (ok, there are some hints for that and the war is going on, people are stretched to the extreme, but still...). It is a very dark movie, much more realistic then any previous sequel, yet, this not a Mad Max. I have to wonder if machines were so superb as presented, it is quite a puzzle how they didn't already won. Not believable in my opinion. SGI is almost perfect, but I come a long way to seek only triangles and textures in a action sci-fi movie to fully entertain me. Something is missing that simply means I won't watch this title again. The trouble with the movie is also a fact that ""the future"" is much, much closer to our present, so that is also a contributing element why the story is not so strong anymore. It will certainly reach to the newer generations to a higher point, but T franchise is in a bit of a crisis for me. I have to add this review comes in a timeframe of Japan earthquake catastrophe; of course it is affected and biased toward idea weather humanity will live long enough to see the judgmenet day with the machines or rather face the end from mother nature itself."
"Turfseer","6","1","2","5 January 2011"," Decently paced but pedestrian sequel to Schwarznegger's more engaging Terminator roles
","I've tried to come up with a reason why so many internet posters are virulently against this film. The best I can come up with is that they're comparing it to the earlier Terminator films starring Arnold Schwarznegger (who they loved) and were simply turned off by the lack of a central antagonist. In some ways, they're right--'Salvation' lacks that one fascinating villain so prominent in the early Terminator sagas. But to claim that this is the 'worst movie' they've ever seen, is way off the mark.<br/><br/>Salvation picks up the story of the fight between the Resistance and Skynet in the year 2018. 'Judgment Day' is long past but it'll be about ten more years before the final victory over Skynet is accomplished. Somehow in this new Terminator, the Resistance has a lot more hardware to work with (helicopters, rocket launchers, etc.) and the chain of command is delineated in much greater detail. Who knew that John Connor actually had a commanding officer? <br/><br/>Probably the best sequence director McG came up with in 'Salvation', is the Giant Terminator attacking the gas station. It's a non-stop, pulsating spectacle which also features a great car chase; watch the Giant Terminator belch out two 'motorcycle terminators' who attempt to chase down the neat little trio of Kyle Reese, the child mute, Star, and part-cyborg Marcus Wright. Wright escapes, but Reese and the kid get chucked into a dumpster, consisting of hostages taken by Skynet. Scenes of a post-apocalyptic holocaust are evoked as the prisoners are packed in like sardines in Skynet's holding pens.<br/><br/>Without the interesting part-man, part-machine character, Marcus Wright, 'Salvation' would be stuck with the interminably boring Christian Bale playing John Connor as a sole protagonist. Bale's performance is akin to Russell Crowe in 'Robin Hood'. Both display no wit or humor and play each part as hard-assed macho men. Boring, boring, boring! After the car chase, the Resistance somehow learns of some kind of electronic signal which might have the potential to destroy their mechanized enemy. Why it never occurs to anyone that this might be a trick on Skynet's part is one of the weaknesses in the Salvation plot. After all, an all-in-one, immediate solution to the Skynet juggernaut comes a little too easy to the commanders of the Resistance. No one seems to suggest that this might be a Trojan Horse type of situation.<br/><br/>We now arrive at Salvation's second main sequence: the capture of Marcus Wright. I can understand the Resistance being awfully paranoid and the fact that Wright himself is unable to recall the circumstances of his early life, but wasn't it obvious that Wright was markedly different than the Terminators who they were familiar with? The real terminators never had a 'conversation' with anyone in the Resistance and were programmed to kill; on the other hand, this Marcus character is being quite sociable with his captors. Even if you buy all the paranoia and the need for the soldiers in the Resistance to cut Wright no slack, certainly Wright's escape and manhunt could have been cut down in the editing room to a more manageable size. The silly chase seems just like filler to me.<br/><br/>Finally, Salvation ends with a whimper. With Connor's blessing, Marcus somehow gets past all of Skynet's security grids and ends up in the main console room. There, a computerized image of the female doctor who stitched him together before 'Judgement Day', reads him the riot act: Marcus actually had a computer chip in his brain that was placed there by Skynet. Marcus was used by Skynet in order to lure John Connor to Skynet's headquarters. Connor came to save his father, Kyle Reese, who Skynet had earlier snatched following the fight at the gas station. Bingo! Marcus simply doesn't want to be part of Skynet's game so he pulls out the computer chip from the back of his head. Whoopee doo! Contrast that with the machinations of the Star Trek Next Generation Crew when they have to figure out how to save Captain Picard from the Borg. Hey, it wasn't so easy to extricate Picard from the collective consciousness of the Borg until Data brilliantly figures out that the command to sleep will do the trick. Nothing like that here! Marcus simply tugs on the strap on the back of his head, and he's free from the diabolical Skynet!<br/><br/>Connor's liberation from the bowels of Skynet also wasn't much of a big deal. The Schwarznegger-like clone is a bit of a surprise, but all he ends up doing is tossing Connor around like a rag doll, instead of crushing him like an ant. And what happened to all the terminators inside headquarters? They've got one machine operational, and it's already 2018! As to Salvation's ending—many purists were appalled that the noble Connor had to be saved by the second light half-Cyborg Marcus Wright via a heart transplant. Given Christian Bale's non-performance, any organ donations from outside the cold-hearted Thespian, can only improve John Connor next time around.<br/><br/>Salvation is certainly a flawed movie. As pointed out before, it lacks a central antagonist and relies on a series of fight scenes with an assortment of killing machines to entertain. It's a hit or miss affair with some battles with the machines more gripping than others. Although Salvation suffers from a lack of originality, the cinematography and editing are well done and the story moves along at a brisk enough pace to keep one's interest. Repeated viewings however, are not really recommended."
"darkknightsiegfrieg","4","1","2","15 December 2010"," What I feel the movie screws up.
","This movies issue is not the time line. The Terminator movies can be changed just based on the line from the very first movie ""there is no fate but what we make."" Arguing the little things like plasma rifles vs. regular rifles seems a bit trivial also. My huge issue with this movie is the feel of the movie. When I heard about this movie I was originally looking forward to the war I got to see in terminator 1 and 2. All of it taking place at night, machines rolling over skulls, and people barely clinging to life. I got a dark and hopeless feel from the original two that I did not get from the 4th. I know that it can be argued that the time-line was changed, however, that does not mean the over all feel of the movies should be changed. (oh, just a personal note, I'm not really a fan of Christian Bale, so him as John Connor bothered me also.)"
"random343343","8","1","2","7 October 2010"," A few holes but overall very good
","As I have said in many reviews, movies will have a hard time living up to expectations. And this movie has enormous expectations put on it. I have seen all the terminators but Terminator 2 was one of the best and I think this toped it. On another note terminator 1 and 3 were a little boring and predictable. Terminator salvation is somewhat a little predictable and has a lot of the classic movie cliché's that we see far too often. This movie has a lot of special effects in it and big budget action scenes.<br/><br/>Some of the character development could have been better and there were parts in the movie that felt like they had no relevance at all and the terminators themselves felt very unintelligent and Robotic and although they are supposed to be robots I would have preferred if they had felt more realistic and believable. This does have some impact on the movie but this is an action movie not a Drama. And it pulls off an amazing job. Keep in mind this is not like the first 3 terminators it is a bit different but I believe it is nice to have something different once in a while 8/10<br/><br/>(10 perfect, 5 not really worth my time, 1 I would rather watch grass grow for 10 hours than watch this movie for 10 minutes)."
"matt_hew","6","1","2","6 September 2010"," Salvation – Hardly.

Unfortunately when the movie was trying to be original you're left with John Connor catching a Harley Davidson Terminator and riding it all the way to Skynet. <br/><br/>Even though Christian Bale is becoming increasingly synonymous with Batman he is a good choice for John Connor – but rather than focus on a man who already knows his future and how he becomes humanity's saviour this movie concentrates on the Terminator hybrid who suffers from a case of moral issues and poor one liners... to add to the cheese he doesn't know he is a Terminator at first... but when he does realise conveniently becomes super strong and a force for good....<br/><br/>The movie is watchable... it just feels as though it was a missed opportunity (especially if this is the first of many) and an opportunity Arnie is probably glad to have missed!"
"ochoamanuel21","8","1","2","30 March 2010"," A good film if you are not a Terminator fan
","When I saw this film on theaters, I thought it was the best film ever since the action in this film is so well directed but after seeing the first two movies and re-visiting this movie on blu-ray, the disappointment kicked in. At first, I really could not grasp what it was, but then it hit me- it really felt as the future in this movie did not felt like Terminator, more like The Road Warrior, and John Connor was not charismatic at all and I really did not care if he became leader or not. The major flaw are the supporting characters, particularly Barnes, Star, and Katherine Brewster. Common cannot emote, particularly the scene when he is told by Connor that his brother is dead. Brewster is just annoying and follows Connor blindly and if Star would not be on the film it would not change, she is an useless mute. These flaws are what makes the film an 8 and not a 10, it is still a good movie but it cannot be compared to the first two masterpieces; however, it is still better than the third one which is just a cheap copy of the second one."
"Movie_Muse_Reviews","6","1","2","16 February 2010"," Entertaining and acceptable, but ironically lacking a strong human element
","The best thing to say about ""Terminator Salvation"" is at least they tried. Between the homage paid to the original films, the non-stop action and a myriad of different writers brought in to make the script as strong as possible, the producers really aspired to reinvigorate the Terminator franchise. ""Salvation"" was not meant to be a cheap attempt to capitalize on the Terminator brand. But not everyone will see it that way because the results stop at ""entertaining."" Despite the thematic cries of why humans will always be better than machines, there isn't heart written into the characters. The new vision is uninspired and flat.<br/><br/>""Salvation"" takes place in the future -- those scenes we only got brief glimpses of during ""Terminator"" and ""T2: Judgement Day."" John Connor (Bale) is the leader of the human resistance living in the post-apocalyptic desert of the Death Valley area. He knows from his mother's tapes that he is to at some point send his father, Kyle Reese (Anton Yelchin) back in time to protect his mother (and ensure his birth and the survival of humanity), but we're far from that. Reese is a teenager at the moment and he's just met Marcus (Sam Worthington) who was sentenced to death in 2003 and is mysteriously alive. They're hoping to meet up with Connor and the resistance, who have just discovered a signal that shuts down the machines and they're hoping to use it on the SkyNet HQ.<br/><br/>This information is enough to generate good action sequences, but it clearly lacks a singular focal character as well as an identifiable antagonist. In the first film it was Arnold and in the second it was T-1000 -- in ""Salvation"" it's just the machines in general. The dynamic of cat and mouse is gone and replaced with mostly mice running from the idea of a cat.<br/><br/>Then there's the fact that this is the first film taking place in the future. Not a bad idea, per se, but McG's strengths lie in action film-making, not envisioning the world Cameron gave us just a taste of in the original films. That world was dark, lonely and no one could be trusted. This film toys around with trust and brings it up only when convenient for suspense purposes. It just throws all the characters in the desert because it looks like a wasteland. It just takes for granted the fact that so many films before it have established what the end of the world might look like (""Mad Max"" the prime example) that it doesn't establish its own rules.<br/><br/>McG's ""Terminator"" is action-packed and constantly moving toward a fairly redeemable climax. The references to the previous films will please die-hard fans of the Terminator universe. The punch is simply not there -- the reason to care about any of the characters other than you knew them once when they were played by different actors and under the direction of a sci-fi genius. It is not an offensive robot-crunching atrocity, but it could use a bit more depth and heart.<br/><br/>~Steven C<br/><br/>Visit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com"
"TxMike","Null","1","2","29 January 2010"," I enjoyed the action as light entertainment, but I don't really know what was going on.
","The day after my wife and I saw this movie, on DVD, we were discussing it. We tried to make sense of the story but we couldn't. For example, why was John Connor's dad a teenager in the future when John was a 30-something adult? Maybe in a different movie he was sent to the future, but I suppose you need to have fairly intimate knowledge of all the Terminator stories to sort all that out.<br/><br/>But ultimately we didn't worry about it. The movie is of course just light, action entertainment. Nothing is to be taken seriously. There is lots of action, and lots of special effects, mostly done very nicely. <br/><br/>In general I like the roles Christian Bale creates, and here he is John Connor. Helena Bonham Carter is Dr. Serena Kogan. Anton Yelchin is Kyle Reese, who in fact is John Connor's biological father. John has to protect Kyle from the terminators otherwise John will never have existed, and the world will not be saved from the machines. <br/><br/>Tense stuff!! <br/><br/>BTW, Bryce Dallas Howard plays Kate Connor. I hadn't seen her in a while, and I found myself wondering if she had a nose job. Her nose seems narrower and more perfect than I remember it. Well, doesn't matter. (PS - I re-watched parts of her earlier movies, ""Lady in the Water"" and ""The Village"" and I believe I was wrong, her nose appears to be the same in all of those. My apologies, Bryce.)"
"Geeky Randy","8","1","2","27 January 2010"," More of an ode than a sequel.
","The story of the future has finally arrived with plenty of references to the previous films, a possible attempt to make up for no returning actors. A film for the fans. John Connor suffered a recast yet again, this time with A-list actor Christian Bale. Only an actor as talented as Bale could be taken seriously as a recast. A more solemn story, but has plenty of spectacular action scenes (though nothing groundbreaking). It is what it is: not a classic, but rather just a Terminator story but it's a great story! McG was able to make this just as dark and nail biting as the first three despite a PG-13 rating.<br/><br/>***½ (out of four)"
"callanvass","8","1","2","27 January 2010"," As a Terminator film, it kinda falls flat. As a blockbuster, it entertained the heck out of me.
","Terminator Salvation was a movie, I was very weary of, for one sole reason, No Arnold. Much to my delight, it managed to pass the time very amiably, and entertain me heavily, for a 100 or so odd minutes. It definitely does not feel like a true Terminator movie, and that did kinda disappoint me, but its so much fun to watch, in the end I didn't really care all that much. There are a few inconsistencies in the film, that hampered the film a little bit, but nothing overly major to where it distracted me. The main quality's Salvation has, is it's entertainment value and the cast. There is so much thrilling action taking place, it really makes you forget about how disappointing it is, due to the lack of Arnold. Having Linda Hamilton do the voice overs for Sarah Connor, was a nice touch, and I also thought it was cool how they planted Arnold's face in the end on the T-800, too bad it wasn't a real cameo. The cast though, is what truly makes this work. If it wasn't for Christian Bale, Anton Yelchin, and Sam Worthington, this film would have been a forgettable action film, in my opinion.<br/><br/>Performances. Christian Bale is the best John Connor yet. He has a few off moments, but for the most part he came through, in a big way. Sam Worthington is excellent as Marcus. His vulnerability, and entering into a realm of unknown, was a treat to watch. Moon Bloodgood is sexy no doubt about that, but she's also a pretty good actress too. Blair doesn't have as much screen time as I'd have like, but she did fine with what she had to do. Helena Bonham Carter receives somewhat top billing, but is rarely in the movie. Anton Yelchin does a fantastic impression of Michael Biehn. For his age, and pressure he had to take over for him, he did an excellent job. Jadagrace is a likable kid actress, go figure!. Her unsureness, and weird quirks were quite cute. Bryce Dallas Howard is mediocre as Kate. She's no Claire Danes, that's for sure. Michael Ironside is a bad ass once more, and about time!.<br/><br/>Bottom line. Terminator Salvation is a very entertaining entry, that I had a good time with. It's disappointing in some cases, but for the most part, I dug every moment. Terminator fans will probably be mixed on how they feel about this movie, but I recommend it highly, for a great night of entertainment.<br/><br/>8/10"

","Terminator Salvation is the 4th episode of the Terminator Franchise. It starts where Rise of the Machines ended and continues the story a couple of years later. <br/><br/>The story is just like the last part kind of obvious and in no way original. But in my opinion it was still much better than the story in Terminator Rise of the Machines which i found very weak. <br/><br/>Salvation does a good job at entertaining but is missing the suspense that Part 1 and 2 of the terminator franchise had. The main reason why i liked this movie was out of curiosity, i wanted to see what the robots from the future looked like and how they operated, the movie does a great job at doing this. <br/><br/>I can recommend this movie to anyone who is interested in seeing an enjoyable action movie with good special effects. If you want an original story and are expecting something completely new from the previous terminator movies, then you will be let down. The movie is just a logical sequel to the first three and nothing more."
"marshy65","9","1","2","4 December 2009"," Well I thought it was good
","I have just watched the film on DVD and what a shame I didn't see it at the cinema....the special effects would have been awesome viewed on a large screen and heard through their sound system.<br/><br/>So the performances weren't Oscar material. They're not meant to be and anyone expecting that seriously needs to reviews their expectations of what they look for in this kind of film. It's good, honest escapism style entertainment and doesn't pretend to be anything other than what it is. There's been a lot of criticism of Christian Bale as John Connor-personally I thought he was pretty good and carried of the role of a resistance leader pretty well. Sam Worthington was probably the best performance as Marcus although we probably all saw the revelation that he was a terminator coming a mile off. I would have liked to have seen more of Kate Connor seeing as she was so important in Terminator 3 and Moon Bloodgood's role could have been developed more. As it was felt these ladies were just there to inject a bit of female presence into the film.<br/><br/>The action scenes and visual effects were brilliant edge of the seat stuff and there were some nice touches during the film such as ""come with me if you want to live"" said by Kyle Reese to Marcus;""I'll be back"" said by John to Kate Connor; Marcus as the terminator who didn't want to be a terminator (his distress at finding out was brilliantly portrayed); and of course the Arnie lookalike terminator towards the end of the film.<br/><br/>To sum up i'd say ""does exactly what it says on the tin""......ie entertain!"
"m_filice87","7","1","2","3 December 2009"," Just watched it on Bluray, and I have to say... it isn't so bad after all
","The only reason why this film did not earn the extra 3 stars, in my opinion, is solely because of the screenplay and the leaked ending. When the dialogue was in play, it wasn't cheesy- which is hard to do. But there just WASN'T ENOUGH! Everybody was/is criticizing McG on his work. And I should admit that I did too. But watching the Director's cut, I really do have to admit that McG did a tremendous job with what he was working with. The visuals of TS are just phenomenal-- he successfully captures a world destroyed by nuclear war and on the brink of losing its humanity. However, he could only do so much with the script he is handed. I say: give him a script penned by, say, James Cameron, Chris/Jon Nolan, Michael Mann, or whoever else that isn't B-class and McG could create an outstanding film.<br/><br/>Additionally, the ending. Yes it was corny only because people ruined it for the writers and director. I, as a hardcore Terminator fan, would have loved it for its irony. The leaked ending was that Marcus wore dead John Connor's skin, and the Resistance went on thinking it was Marcus who died and not John. Marcus- unaware of Kyle being John's father- would have raised Kyle like his younger brother, grooming him to be a good fighter. Kyle would have admired him as his role model. Hence, Marcus/John's skin sends his right hand man back through time to save John Connor's mother. This would have been perfect, yet the leaker ruined it for us fans. I also truly believe that McG and better writers could have SUCCESSFULLY turned this story from John Connor's prophecized leadership to Marcus' true role in the war against the machines. But when it comes down do it, his bosses (producers) hired mediocre writers and were not keen enough on securing information. It is really evident that McG does have a passion for the Terminator franchise.<br/><br/>Sound- superb. Plot- like I said, kind of slow with lack of dialogue, and some parts in the story heavily relied on coincidence and chance. <br/><br/>Blame the producers and writers, not the visual artist. Rehire McG but hire somebody who will give him something worth his salt."
"vladiguy","8","1","2","3 December 2009"," An underrated action movie
","When I came to IMDb to check Salvation's rating, having just watched it at a friend's house, I expected to see a rating in the upper 7's, perhaps even an 8. I thought it was so much better than Terminator 3 that the latter could simply be written off from the franchise altogether. But apparently, if you're to believe the critic on the movie's front page, it's the worst one yet. I couldn't disagree more. This movie is better than Terminator 3, and it's not even close.<br/><br/>As a big Terminator fan, I have always been interested in the events of Judgment Day and the experiences of Kyle Reese and the other survivors of the apocalypse. One reviewer commented that setting the movie in this dismal future is self-defeating because it's like reading the Bible. I completely disagree. This story doesn't end with Arnold Schwarzenegger being lowered into a pit of molten steel; it ends with the destruction of Skynet and freedom for humanity from machines. That's always what Terminator has been about.<br/><br/>One of the great things about this movie is the lack of constant, grating clichés that have destroyed Hollywood film-making over the last ten years. That's not to say everything in the movie is original, but at this point it's a breath of fresh air to watch something as imaginative as Salvation.<br/><br/>For one thing, the atmosphere in the movie is fantastic. Wilted skyscrapers dot the horizon of Los Angeles like dead trees; and the silence as one of the movie's main characters trots through a long-dead town is as frightening as it is misleading.<br/><br/>The terminators in the movie are as creepy as ever--skeleton warriors with terrifying strength and speed. Some seem to wander the ruins of the world hunting for man, their human-like costumes tattered and soiled by months spent in the wilderness. These aren't the shiny new robots of Transformers: they're gritty, mercilessly violent, and feel authentic.<br/><br/>My favorite aspect of the movie is how cleverly it ties into Terminators 1 & 2. It gets down to incredible detail: the resistance fighters, at the beginning of the movie, break into a Skynet laboratory where they discover information about a new terminator, the T-800. This is the model that Arnold played in the first two movies; the synthetic creatures the resistance encounters during Salvation are the older, but somehow more frightening T-600s that don't have flesh or hair. That they are older and less advanced helps to explain why they are more easily defeated and evaded--if only readers would pay attention. Even so, I thought the action was compelling.<br/><br/>The connections don't end there. Somehow, Skynet has learned that Kyle Reese is the father of John Connor, and it is trying to kill him long before he is sent back in time. This struck me as a great hook for Salvation's story.<br/><br/>The resistance movement itself uses older weapons from the 90s to combat Skynet: retired A-10 anti-tank aircraft strike at the supercomputer's killing machines, and human fighters dress themselves in mostly civilian garb, wielding cheap and durable household weapons and AKs, as you would expect any post-apocalyptic army to do. The implication here seems to be that Skynet destroyed most of our military technology with the initial nuclear strike, and it is left to the technology of past generations to supplement the resistance.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the story, for the most part. There were some aspects that could use a lot of improvement--I didn't think John Connor was properly set up as the prophet that he is. I didn't get the feeling that resistance fighters were more loyal to him than their commanders at all, and that's an essential element of the story. Overall, though, I thought it was entertaining and fit very cleanly into the Terminator storyline. Rather than creating entirely new ground, Salvation looks to Terminator 2 and ties together the loose strings. It does a great job.<br/><br/>That said, the movie is not perfect and has its fair share of clichés. But unlike most other movies of this decade, it uses those clichés well, and they are masked by what this movie does best: atmosphere and action. But after watching the abomination that was Terminator 3, and virtually every other science fiction movie to be released in the last ten years, Salvation is a breath of fresh air. It's about time someone made a movie with a little imagination."
"akelias","8","1","2","2 December 2009"," Terminator 4 (Prequel) is different but good.
","OK, I didn't watch the Theatrical cut I just finished the Director's cut so my comments are only to that cut of the film. I have to say I really don't understand some of the negative comments about this being cliché and all the other remarks about this film. First off the Terminator franchise invented many of these clichés you speak of. I mean for god's sakes the franchise is 25 years old. Secondly let us not forget the first three Terminator's were essentially a sci-fi story about people getting chased by an unstoppable foe. There were sub-plots but there really wasn't time to flesh out the characters in any of them. So don't glorify the past movies too much. With that being said I think Salavation had to be different than any of the previous incarnations. It is after all the prequel if you think about it. The world these characters inhabited is the post-apocalyptic post-altered timeline world were machines are in control. It was dramatically different and it had to be. That I think is what made it a good movie it didn't rely on the tired story line it had to reinvent the world and pay homage to the old franchise. I love that this movie showed the first prototype for Cyberdyne's Cybernetic organism. Arnold's version couldn't have been the first. Someone at some point had to invent an original version that wasn't some time traveling copy of the 1984 Terminator. I liked the symmetry of how John Connor fate was still not believed by some even in the post-apocalyptic world, much like his mother was not believed before. Yes, there were a few plot holes here or there but most were related to the continuity mistakes that are always brought up in each film. (All the films had mistakes). However overall this movie reinvented the 'origins' of how all this time traveling came to be and how it has created consortium of paradoxes. I'd like to see a next film that delves into those paradoxes head on."
"axlrhodes","8","1","2","30 November 2009"," Not the disaster i was expecting.
","From the critical mauling this film received in the press i was expecting a bloated,Transformers style experience that would distance me from anything created by James Cameron and leave a huge dent in the pride of a proud franchise however, im glad to say i totally wrong. For all the mud thrown at this film i found it to be an efficient and functional Terminator film that is streets ahead of Jonathan Mostows T3. T3 was bad as it divorced itself from the serious tone set by Camerons films preffering to indulge in self parody and humour wheres as McGs film is much more straight laced and in keeping with the feel of Jim Camerons work. For out and out fans there are some wonderful references and it works as a post apocalyptic war movie.On the whole, a lot better than i was led to believe."
"buggyinthevolvo","7","1","2","27 November 2009"," great action movie but not a real terminator movie.
","I""m not saying this movie is bad or anything, it was a pretty good movie. But it was more like a future sci fi movie not a terminator film. it did not have the flow of the usual terminator feeling and mood. The second problem is that, the plot is very minor until Marcus Wright gets caught by Connor. Then we learn that Kyle Reese who is John Connor s father has been caught by the machines, so john has to save his future father or he wont be born.so at last third part of the film is where it goes into major plot and had some visually amazing action. first 2/3 was fun with successful action scenes but, well, pointless in a way. So this is after the war, so the action scenes of the 2/3 of the film is mild but purely fun. the last third is where it gets exciting and gains that actual terminator 1,2 climax feeling. So a well done film, but it had a lot of problems but they are minor.<br/><br/>decent film, have to watch it in the big screens !"
"Ultimex_Varptuner","7","1","2","24 November 2009"," It's not the end of the world as you know it!
","I truly believe in McG's commitment to the Terminator franchise and to this project. Propelled by the desire, not only to honour the franchise but also to endow his career with the kind of Batman Begins, franchise-revitalising boost that Christian Bale would surely provide, how could this possibly be a bad movie? <br/><br/>Well, in fairness, it isn't. It's a really good picture and a fun way to spend two hours. But, has McG succeeded in taking things back to their gritty roots? Were all his efforts to force his cast and crew to read Cormac McCarthy's 'The Road' in the hope of capturing a truly bleak, unforgiving post-apocalyptic future worthwhile? <br/><br/>Of course not. It's McG and he's a plonker.<br/><br/>Yes, as assured as the cast are, as wonderful as the sets and even to a point, the story are what you basically have here is a bunch of beautifully coiffured and made-up lipstick commandos throwing heroic shapes in a slightly litter-strewn desert while some robots that look a bit like Arnie fire miniguns very, very inaccurately at them.<br/><br/>But what about Skynet? I hear you say. Haven't the machines taken over? Isn't humanity on the bones of it's arse? <br/><br/>Well yes and no. You see,life in McG's future really isn't that bad. Basically, the rule of thumb is: if you see/hear a really loud, silver machine coming towards you, run like f**k. Other than that, you can basically just carry on as normal. The buses don't run anymore but if you have a hunt about there are some pretty nice cars lying around with petrol still in them. So don't worry, okay? <br/><br/>Oh and for all you vain ladies out there, McG's future still has plenty of good hairdressing salons open for business (evidently).<br/><br/>Seriously though, Salvation, apart from it's certificate 12A tameness is spot on. The cast are excellent with a reasonable balance between eye-candy and solid acting and the set pieces are universally thrilling. Although, I should warn my hero Christian Bale that if he plays it any more intense he is going to push himself into self parody.<br/><br/>Salvation for all it's Charlie's Angels in the future-ishness is far superior to Rise of the Machines and personally I feel that an Arnie cameo would have wrecked things as only Arnie in his latter days could. As it stands, his digital appearance is a uniquely thrilling moment that almost makes up for the distance the franchise has travelled from it's dirty, downbeat first instalment.<br/><br/>Provided we make peace with the fact that Hollywood simply doesn't do films like Terminator 1 anymore, then this is as good an action film as any of the current generation.<br/><br/>But don't expect another Batman Begins."

"proterozoic","4","1","2","14 November 2009"," It could have been good.
","Remember when terminators used to be terrifying? The first two films had just one robotic villain apiece - the second one didn't even use firearms! - but both films were soaked in a feeling of panic and dread. The rules were established early on and were stuck to: if a terminator catches you, you're as good as dead. And the characters spent most of the time barely getting away.<br/><br/>But that was 20 years ago. Terminator: Salvation is full of lovely hardware - giant VTOL prisoner transports, 40-foot-tall mega-terminators, assorted hovercraft, and even snakelike marine robots. But here's the thing - if one lone terminator managed to ravage entire SWAT teams point blank in T2, then how do you pit all this deadly new force against a few hardscrabble resistance fighters and end up with a movie that isn't over in 5 minutes? The answer is sadly predictable. <br/><br/>The old terminators were frighteningly fast and intelligent. In T:S, they helpfully clang around and land slow, non-lethal blows until the heroes can get away. It's like watching the notorious slow-mo fistfight between Captain Kirk and the Gorn lizard man. The amateurs in charge of T:S were so in love with their toys that they failed to think about making the match-up between man and machine realistic and interesting.<br/><br/>Here's a quiz: if you're an evil, all-powerful AI, and you have the number one person on your global kill list locked up in a cell, do you a) fill the cell with poison gas and kill him in an instant, or b) send a slow, rumbling robot to open the cell door and spend several minutes throwing him around the facility until he lands near something he can use to defeat you? Yeah, you guessed it.<br/><br/>The whole second half of the movie is a run down the list of villain clichés. The slow and overly-elaborate killing methods. The Talking Killer. The plan that gets explained in detail to the character who's going to stop it in the nick of time. They even included the ultimate, sad cliché of action film - the lone hero who goes into the lion's den to rescue the love interest/dog/cute supporting character, and inevitably succeeds. Remember, this is the heart of Skynet, ostensibly filled with robots that could take on a battalion of soldiers. What suspense could we possibly be talking about at this point? <br/><br/>It gets even dumber in the parts involving Moon Bloodgood's character. There's the hair that doesn't get ruffled after gun battles and mud-slogging escapes; there's the rescue by a strong male companion. There's the blue-white American smile so shiny that instead of storming the Skynet citadel, the Resistance could have just lined their female pilots on the perimeter and burnt the whole place to the ground like Archimedes. Finally, there's the obligatory undressing scene with the obligatory flimsy excuse. Actually, let me correct that. There was no excuse. Bloodgood takes her jacket and bra off and stands there with her breasts solemnly covered, for absolutely no reason! I would be OK with that if they had given us a good close look, but this is a PG-13 movie, so they don't. So that's that.<br/><br/>There was just one good idea in this flat rehash: Sam Worthington's character, who starts out human and is transformed into an unwitting robot slave for the machines. This is shockingly revealed in the middle of the movie - or, if you watch TV, in the trailers for the movie. This is a marketing decision that defies explanation. Why did they think it was a good idea to spoil the only major plot twist in the ads? <br/><br/>A special mention goes to Arnold Schwarzenegger, whose likeness makes a cameo in the form of a terminator specially personalized to kill John Connor. He attempts to do so, again, by grabbing him by the front of his jacket and flinging him in various directions, which, surprisingly, doesn't work. This makes Arnold's terminator officially less dangerous than the cassowary bird of New Guinea, which, despite not having a metallic skeleton, can kill people by disembowelling them with its sharp claws.<br/><br/>There's so much more, but you get the idea. This movie officially completes the parallel between the Terminator, Alien and Batman film series. All three started out as classics, before being euthanized by an atrociously bad fourth installment. So far, only Batman has managed to shake the curse. We wait, patiently."

","At first it seemed like a dumb repetition and a nostalgic rerun (re-iteration) of previous Terminators. Moreover, it seemed like a dumb Video Game imitation, but it turned out to be the deep philosophical movie that explores the fine border between a human thought and behavior (explores the gray areas, ambiguity of language and behavior) and a precision of a robot's logic (black and white). I am a Computer Scientist. And I declare: Amazing movie! The language sciences and a computer science so far have been struggling to find a bridge between ambiguity of human language & behavior AND the robotic black & white logic of machine thinking. Guess what? The author demonstrates the brilliancy of the evolutionary biological development of human ambiguity of language & behavior to ensure the survival of biological species (versus the robotic ""Black And White"" thinking and logic). I do not try to explain or digest anything here. The crux of the movie and of the analysis of ""human psychology vs. machine thinking"" is when John Connor is faced with the decision whether to let the human-like robot go free or to terminate the creature. Powerful demonstration of human ambiguous logic and how it helps us to survive."

","I have to agree with user ""siderite"", who states this as a ""decent"" film. Especially considering my concerns when I heard that McG would be at the helm. I know that there are quite a few people who liked his take on Charlies Angels, but I thought the movies were ... bad and not in a good sense! <br/><br/>But he himself said, that he evolved, plus Christian Bale was set to star in this movie. Apart from the fact, that the real main ""man"" here is Sam Worthington (he is really great and you almost wish he played the John Connor part), Christian Bale lacks any kind of charisma. His John Connor only really is gripping, when he talks over a radio/communication thing. Other than that, you would be forgiven for doubting the whole Connor ""myth"" (see previous movies, if you haven't) that revolves around his person.<br/><br/>Other characters that stay in your memory, is Moon Bloodgood and Anton Yelchin (who also had a role in the J.J.

If he only brought the energy he used when ""assaulting"" (verbally) the DP, it would have helped the movie. But with his rough dark voice, he almost seems like a caricature of his Batman role. It's a shame, but if this and Public Enemies are the movies you see him first, you might get the impression, this isn't really a good actor.

"Superunknovvn","6","1","2","13 June 2009"," ""Terminator"" is not the franchise with the brilliant sequels anymore
","Somewhere in the back of my mind I had this idea that because ""Terminator 2: Judgement Day"" was not only one of the best sequels, but one of the best movies ever, that this would apply for the whole franchise. Well, ""Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines"" pretty much put an end to that thought, but then filmmakers didn't really try to enter new territory with that movie. All they did was to remake ""Terminator 2"" (badly) and tack on a different ending. Now, ""Terminator Salvation"" is where the story could really have moved forward and the quality of the franchise might have picked up again.<br/><br/>Learning that McG of all people would direct this movie, my hopes were pretty much destroyed before I ever saw the trailer for this movie. I mean, who thought that any fan would be happy with that decision? Who saw ""Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle"" and decided this was the guy to direct a ""Terminator""-movie? Hollywood-politics I guess. Then Christian Bale was attached to this project, and at least he's an A-list actor, probably the biggest A-list actor around these days, but then he already is Batman, so why does he have to be John Connor, too?<br/><br/>The foreshadowing wasn't all that promising. I didn't really look for scoop or anything from then on, but went into the cinema unprepared - well, as unprepared as you can be. Of course, some plot points and ""cameo"" surprises had already been revealed to me. What can you do. Anyway, I went into the movie without prejudices and with high hopes. Truth be told, it could have been worse, but it SHOULD have been a much better movie.<br/><br/>""Terminator Salvation"" actually is a new chapter. A completely different movie to its predecessors that took place in our time. Those movies were road movies, edge-of-your-seat-hunts and fights between two opponents. This movie is a futuristic war movie. Suspense had to be replaced by action and explosions, and that premise could only mean that the fourth chapter in the saga would be very, very different.<br/><br/>The most disappointing thing about ""Terminator Salvation"" (what has the title got to do with anything, BTW?) is that it screws around too much. The PG-13 rating harms the movie a lot. These Terminators aren't brutal death machines. They merely push people around and capture them. They're not as focused and threatening as the T-800 and the T-1000 were in parts 1 and 2. The timeline has been f_cked up completely by now. Some plot points lead nowhere, some characters aren't fleshed out (John Connor's wife, Marcus' love interest), others have only vague backstories (what exactly did Marcus do to deserve the death sentence? Who is Helena Bonham Carters character and what are her intentions?) And what's with all these characters anyway? Marcus, Star, the submarine captain? What have these people got to do with the ""Terminator"" canon?<br/><br/>Not everything has been done wrong, though. You can see that scriptwriters really tried to satisfy fans and put in references to previous parts, but it just doesn't work most of the time. These references aren't made with style. They are shoved down our throats, like when the classic theme is used to introduce the T-800. It's almost like a parody bit. ""You Could Be Mine"" by Guns N' Roses is used, too, but instead of putting it to a kickas§-moment, it's just kind of random, as if McG wanted it to be somewhere in the movie, but couldn't be bothered to find a good place for it.<br/><br/>The ending, however, is the biggest problem with ""Terminator Salvation"". Apparently it's the result of numerous last-minute-re-writes. As a viewer you'll be completely confused about what's going on. What was Skynets's plan? What was anybody's plan for that matter? Then there's a fight with a single Terminator (in a factory of Terminators) and a silly climax involving the near death of one character, which feels tacked on and not thought through.<br/><br/>In the end, ""Terminator Salvation"" isn't much better or worse than part 3, but the lukewarm, box office result has shown that this isn't the movie fans have been waiting for. Making two more movies like this one seems pointless. TS may as well be the end of a franchise that once stood out for its one unbelievably great sequel."

","What a silly, silly movie. I wouldn't say i'm disappointed as after reading many reviews prior to seeing the film, i had a good idea of what to expect. But i have to say that at no point were these expectations exceeded. Terminator Salvation is a typical modern-day Hollywood blockbuster; lots of slick action sequences and good-looking young actors with little or no plot to back it up. I find it bemusing that so much money can be spent producing a major film and yet so little be invested in a good screenplay writer! What the hell. The amount of times i shook my head and despaired at how stupid this plot is beggars belief. When i first heard a 4th installment of the Terminator franchise was being worked on - and having seen a few sequence shots - i applauded the spin on the chase-premise and eagerly anticipated a serious futuristic war film. Sadly, T4 is way too dumb, unrealistic and lacking in atmosphere to ever fulfill this. Please tell me someone else wondered how John Connor manages to get back to his feet after being slugged in the chest by a T-800, thrown distance into metal bulkheads etc etc without breaking almost all the bones in his body??? Jesus Christ. How can anyone write this into a script and not think people will question it??? And how come Marcus, albeit in pretty impressive fashion, kicks some human butt in an early scene (but still conventionally) and then later (after we've discovered he's in fact a cyborg) is seen throwing T-800's around??? Why didn't he just use his prosthetic arms to crush the humans earlier??? Why was he struggling with them and how come his punches didn't rip the jaws off of the rednecks he was chinning??? STUPID!! Nobody has even thought about it! OK we'll just forget that bit 'cause he looked human then, but now we know he's a machine he can throw other machines around which probably weigh a metric tonne or something. Idiots. And one more major complaint: i was just about buying all the action stuff in the first half hour until the 100ft super-terminator shows up and starts picking people up and firing laser bolts. Yeah, OK, so we're supposed to believe that in just 9 years time (genius of Skynet or not) we can conceive a machine of that engineering complexity??? McG obviously watched Transformers a few too many times. Ridiculous. <br/><br/>Oh OK at times it's a fun ride but that's it, nothing more. It's just impossible not to compare the 3rd and 4th films to the 1st & 2nd and wonder if Hollywood is actually capable of producing a blockbuster with an intelligent f**king script. We're not impressed by shiny things blowing up anymore. Any film with some money behind it can do that. Think up something realistic and innovative before you continue to ruin classic stories again.<br/><br/>6 out of 10 just for some decent action sequences and occasionally reasonable acting, and a bit of nostalgia thrown in."

","Terminator Salvation is a heart thumping, nerve-shredding and action packed thrill ride and holds a strong eye for invention and story. Basically Terminator Salvation is a mile times better than its predecessor, for which many people thought would be the end of The Terminator franchise, but not for McG. The man who lacks the common decency to have a full name has achieved an epic looking and emotional picture that has re-ignited a franchise and who has positioned himself as an excellent action film director.<br/><br/>Gone is the slick LA of the 20/21st century, replaced with dark underground bunkers and huge robot factory cities. Also gone is the normal endoskelaton chases human story and replaced with a 'men on a mission' adventure. The adventure aspect is as every bit as thrilling as it is enigmatic, which takes McG to more of an accomplished insight into the Terminator universe.<br/><br/>The action is chilling and absolutely extraordinary and breathes a fresh set of light to the story. Unlike other Terminator films of the passed, Terminator Salvation up's the anti and action to beyond the other entries. The only downfall i can comment on is the use of some corny dialogue, but like previous Terminator films they wouldn't work without it.<br/><br/>My verdict overall though is that McG has sparked a new light and interest into the Terminator franchise and is one that gives all the post apocalyptic action fans have been waiting to see."
"djs_sayer","5","1","2","4 June 2009"," Nothing new. Well done. Worth watching?
","Many parts of the film were clinging on the back of the first two terminator movies. The creators felt too strongly that the story would carry itself where my essential problem is how it fits in exactly with the Terminator universe. Everything happens how you expect it to, with nothing new to add, giving the film an unfortunate shallow depth.<br/><br/>The action scenes are excellent, not over the top or too difficult to follow. Even from Charlie's Angels, we kind of understood that McG isn't a bad director, and this film was very fitting for a man of his experience. The musical score wasn't wasted either.<br/><br/>Scripting wasn't bad, it got worse, better, worse and so on, unaided by the actors who didn't seem to understand their characters very well (which I believe was due to poor character development). The more developed characters made up for that and Christian Bale made a great John Connor.<br/><br/>There are movies that are made for passion, and movies made for money. This was for money, and a good one for it. A slip road for a sequel with enough of the story left and enough decent action to move us onwards. Overall, it's a bit of fun. There's no reason to go out of your way to watch this unless that's your interest, but for me, I prefer films that are made for a better reason."
"Baldrick44","6","1","2","4 June 2009"," Hmmm...
","Sequels are a business fraught with difficulty. If you don't have a clear idea where the franchise is going from the start, they often get lost in a myriad of new characters and plot holes. Such is what happened to the Matrix sequels and such is what has happened here in Terminator: Salvation.<br/><br/>It is the Year 2018, and Skynet's Teminator program is wiping out the human population that is left post-Judgement Day. In this war scenario we find John Connor ( Christian Bale )- not the messianic leader yet of the Resistance but a leader of his own pocket of hardened veterans. However his faith in his mission is shaken by the arrival of a new figure- Marcus Wright ( Sam Worthington ) whose own agenda and past will force Connor to form an uneasy alliance with him in order to save Connor's father- Kyle Reece ( Anton Yelchin ).<br/><br/>Terminator Salvation is not a sci fi/action film- but rather a futuristic war movie that doesn't really add up. By making this movie only M rated ( PG-13 if you are in the states ) the war against the machines is reduced to something quite...tame. Terminators no longer are the ruthless killing machines that they once were and instead are quite content tossing people around a lot. The whole idea of a brutal world seems silly as it lacks the brutal bit. Why don't the terminators simply kill the marines instead of tossing them against walls? Why doesn't Skynet simply slaughter the humans as soon as they arrive? To their credit Worthington and Yelchin are quite good in their roles, giving Marcus and Kyle some good scenes together and managing to find something in what is a pretty dull story. Christian Bale on the other hand is waaaay too intense. Every line is delivered with a frown and a grimace and he doesn't seem to get emotional at all- except to yell.<br/><br/>Terminator: Salvation would always get compared to 1,2 & 3- but they've tipped the balance in the machines favour. In doing so the movie doesn't become more interesting, but less."
"Quebec_Dragon","6","1","2","4 June 2009"," Acceptable sequel lacking emotional impact
","Finally, we get a Terminator movie that explores what happens during the actual war between the machines and the humans, a movie taking place during the apocalyptic glimpses seen in previous films. Was it properly exploited? Read on to find out.<br/><br/>The action scenes were decent but were sometimes difficult to follow being victims of shaky camera-itis. Maybe it's just me but I didn't find them very thrilling either except for a few. Props to the helicopter crash scene from the pilot's perspective though. The visual effects were of high quality and the terminators never looked so good with a bigger variety than ever before although I'm still not sure about the moto terminator concept. For what might seem like more primitive terminators (in Los Angeles), please consider that the terminators seen in other films were from farther into the future. The sound effects were quite good especially the thuds from the bigger machines. Storywise, I found the plot had a few great ideas that weren't satisfactorily explored or explained, particularly Marcus' past and why the terminators started taking human prisoners instead of continuing to exterminate them. They didn't show us what actually happened and it felt like a missed opportunity. Certain plot elements didn't seem to make sense at the time and it bugged me throughout. I thought I was being difficult but after reading a few of the lower-rated reviews, I do indeed see there are major plot holes (especially involving Kyle Reese). <br/><br/>More importantly, certain moments lacked the dramatic or emotional impact they should have had. In particular, there's a cool moment near the end I cannot specifically mention where you think to yourself ""holy crap! did they actually do this!"" only to be drastically minimized just afterwards (you thinking, ""how lame"") and then brought back later in a different location when the dramatic impact was already defused. The finale, which should have been heart-wrenching, simply flat-lined on an emotional level. The dialogs were mostly lackluster and seemed to like stating the obvious (Evasive maneuvers!). I liked the characters of Kyle Reese and Marcus and thought they were played well but although Christian Bale was his usual intense self, he didn't portray the quieter moments convincingly. He seemed one-dimensional. <br/><br/>Visually, the colors seemed bleached out making everything look grittier and gloomier. I understand the reason why but I didn't particularly care for it. The production design and settings were OK but weren't particularly original or memorable (nowhere near the skull-covered grounds of previous films). I was also disappointed at the lack of full-scale military engagements between machine and human. The actual ""war"" you might have expected from trailers was not really shown, it was mostly skirmishes or duels. Overall though, it's a good sequel lacking the heart and emotional core of the others. If you've seen the previous films, you'll want to see this, perhaps not worth full price in theaters, but try not to think too hard about logical inconsistencies and to enjoy the action/visual effects for their own sake. If you haven't seen the previous films, you might be lost and I would recommend watching at least one Terminator film before (I would say Terminator 2, the highlight of the series). <br/><br/>Rating: 6 out of 10.

","The largest let-down aspect of this film is that THERE IS NO CHARACTER. You presume your following John Connor but you don't, you are shifted between two characters yet they are barely protagonists and you cannot have a story without a protagonist, and vice versa, period.<br/><br/>The CGI is fantastic but not enough action involving the smaller machines - the common terminators which we love. The lack of real plot is just too hard to dismiss and the end 30 minutes are way too predictable.<br/><br/>I still recommend it, it was quite fun and the machines look pretty awesome (though I'm sure i saw a terminator wearing a bandanna at one point...). Its McG (what a ridiculous title) - you shouldn't be going to see this with high expectations."

","Right of the back, Kids and young audience will LOVE this film, however I am 28, and I was 12 when T2 was released in Denmark. That is to this day the best cinema experience I have ever had. So my expectations to Terminator Salvation was very high, partly because Christian Bale is a franchise saver and partly because it Finally took place in the future. (as T3 should have done).<br/><br/>Unfortunately the story line in Terminator Salvation is weak at best. It's not the least bit original (as T1 and T2 were) and there are no twists and turns that are not totally predictable. The acting is OK, but I was expecting Christian Bale to be perfect for John Conner. He was medium at best.<br/><br/>The CGI was perfect, but the action (and there are LOTS of action) was not nearly as brutal as it should be. Terminators KILL PEOPLE, they don't throw them at a well every time they get their hands on a human. I won't give away the ending, but I will say that the last scene before they ride in to the horsiest like Lucky Luke, is clearly something they thrown together in 2 hours, trying to change the ending, because the original ending had leaked. The monologue ending as all terminator films have had, was totally cliché and poorly done.<br/><br/>The good things in this movie are the action and the CGI. The rest is crap. I gave it 6 because they animated a young Arnold in to it, and some of the homage to the old movies was done well, like the ""you could be mine"" from Guns N Roses on the radio and stuff like that.<br/><br/>Apart from that the film is filled with factually errors. I will name a few here. Warning SPOLERS COMING NOW On an end not I would say, watch this movie if you are less than 20 years of age or like movies like Transformers and The fast and the Furious.<br/><br/>SPOILER 1: Gas on gas station will not blow up or burn. After 6 months gas is no longer flammable and won't be able to run a car.<br/><br/>SPOILER 2: The scene where the computer explains the lame plot to the half man half machine is so stupid and unoriginal. I could not help but think of the South Park episode ""Something Wal-Mart is coming this way"" where the man in wall-mart is showing his different forms. (With a hat and without his jacket etc.) And why give away everything like some stupid James Bond or Scooby Doo villain. If the computer had just STFU they would have won the war.<br/><br/>SPILER 3: (ENDING SPOILER): The last scene with the heart transplant is so stupid it utterly destroys what little quality this script had. You cannot do an outdoor heart transplant, even if they by poor luck had the same blood type and you against all odds had the right equipment for it."

","How does a movie deliver to it's audience? That is the question. Does it rely on breathtaking visuals, back to back action (interspersed with ear splitting audio) that gives you no time to blink, every shot being a fight for survival? Well Terminator Salvation definitely delivers on the aforementioned. If these are your typical expectations of an Action Movie you will have no regrets. <br/><br/>But for the ones who are always seeking meaningful action this movie definitely disappoints. I happen to fall into the class though i warn you this review comes from someone who could write pages worth of appreciation for a movie like Death Race( or any Statham movie for that matter. ""Girls- who's looking for sense anyway?"") Furthermore, I will not go onto say that the story was just an excuse for action. There definitely was a story- where lead characters( that would also include the mute kid- Star) remain mum for a longer part of the reel and you are left with action sequences to build the story. If the writers ever thought they could cover up the inconsistencies with senseless action, well they thought wrong. We can't ignore glaring mistakes in the script. why doesn't sky net just do away with Kyle Reese when his identity is established? If Marcus Wright is indeed identified as one of the terminators, why is he attacked by them? Only to prolong the action you say? Well i rest my case. Almost... Directors/ Writers/all men alike women aren't just fanciful props. Why have such a large cast when you couldn't flesh out characters. However, the show was saved even for all the criticism. Mr. Governor, you did save the ""show"" from sinking with your brief two minute appearance ( not including when your face gets chipped off) which launched me into nostalgia. <br/><br/>The action is definitely worth your money and time and i shall end my review with just that and let the stunts linger!"
"omahonyjason","5","1","2","2 June 2009"," Acting & Story lines as Mechanical as Terminators but Awesome Special Effects
","TERMINATOR SALVATION Director: McG Country: USA Year: 2009 Language: English Runtime: 115 Minutes Rating: 12 A<br/><br/>Welcome to the summer – the weather is gorgeous and the box-office giants are storming our cinema screens. One of the most highly anticipated films of the year and certainly one of the most talked about is TERMINATOR SALVATION, the fourth film in the Terminator saga which first hit our screens a full quarter of a century ago in THE TERMINATOR (1984). It made monumental stars of both Arnold Schwarzenegger and its director, James Cameron. The first went on to become Governor of California while the other went on to make the biggest box-office smash of all time, TITANIC (1997).<br/><br/>TERMINATOR SALVATION arrives in cinemas dragging some serious baggage, courtesy of Christian Bale's infamous, foul mouthed on-set rant in which he eviscerated a lighting technician. If you haven't seen it yet, or rather heard it, you can easily find it on YouTube, and join the upwards of 5 million punters that have tuned in for a listen.<br/><br/>The new film arrives without either Schwarzenegger or Cameron – the best things about the first two movies. The third installment in the franchise was pretty poor and didn't perform anywhere near as spectacularly at the box office. Warner Bros' and Sony Pictures' have taken a gamble in handing control of the latest film to McG, who was responsible for the unintentionally hilarious CHARLIE'S ANGELS (2000) and CHARLIE'S ANGLES: FULL THROTTLE (2003) so it had the potential to be a disaster!<br/><br/>TERMINATOR SALVATION is set in post-apocalyptic 2018, where John Connor (Christian Bale) is the man fated to lead the human resistance against Skynet and its army of Terminators. But the future that Connor was raised to believe in is altered, in part, by the appearance of Marcus Wright (Sam Worthington), a stranger whose last memory is of being on death row. Connor must decide whether Marcus has been sent from the future, or rescued from the past. As Skynet prepares its final onslaught, Connor and Marcus both embark on an odyssey that takes them into the heart of Skynet's operations, where they uncover the terrible secret behind the possible annihilation of mankind.<br/><br/>So how does the movie rate against the earlier films? Unfortunately, it never comes close to scaling the heights of THE TERMINATOR (1984) or TERMINATOR 2 (1991) but it's a far better attempt than the dreadful TERMINATOR 3 (2003).<br/><br/>While the story lines and much of the acting are as robotic as the machines there's no doubting that the filmmakers have pulled out all the stops when it comes to action sequences, awesome visual effects and technically astounding computer graphics. Hell, you can nearly see how the film cost a reputed $200 million! <br/><br/>That being said, if you're hoping for something as brilliant as the first two movies you'll be bitterly disappointed. If, however, you're just looking for a two-hour distraction you'll be pleasantly amused."
"refresh_daemon","6","1","2","30 May 2009"," Thrilling action and ho-hum storytelling; a bit of a disappointment
","At this time of writing, I don't know what the critics are saying about Terminator Salvation, so I'm just going to relay my thoughts about the fourth installment of the Terminator series.<br/><br/>In a departure from previous films, Terminator Salvation is set in the future, after Skynet, an artificial intelligence, wipes out much of humanity. The remaining humans (represented in a very brief montage partway through the movie) are mostly stuck as resistance fighters. John Conner ends up being a bit of a prophet figure (having all his experience with terminators and passed down knowledge about the future from his mother). Along the way, a (and this should be no spoiler) man who was possibly turned into a machine shows up and has to kick some ass as well.<br/><br/>The story really feels by the numbers. It still has a little of that man-machine consideration in the character of Marcus Wright (the inmate turned cyborg), but its very little indeed. Everything moves along just as you'd expect it would. There are no surprises here (unless you're quite oblivious). In some ways, Terminator Salvation is a huge letdown, because there is so much potential in exploring the tensions of being a prophet (instead we get Christian Bale brooding) as well as another look at what makes humanity human (but that conflict seems entirely absent in Marcus and largely absent in anyone but briefly in John Conner). The story also works hard to make sure people don't notice its contrivances, by ratcheting up tension, especially around the characters of Kyle Reese and John Conner (from Terminator), both of whom Skynet had plenty of opportunities to wipe out, but somehow failed to do so. As such, believability was lost in the film for me about halfway through.<br/><br/>There are some cute references in the script to past Terminators, which almost overstay their welcome, and the action and effects were nice, for what they were. But all of it felt a little ho-hum in the end to me. When it was all done, I felt like I'd watched a high-budget but less than average episode of a serialized television series. In some ways, Terminator has taken the opposite approach of the Aliens franchise. Aliens started out a simple and effective space-horror/action (primarily in the first two) and progressively added larger themes and ideas, becoming a big mess along the way. Terminator, on the other hand, had a lot of interesting science fiction ruminations (time-travel, destiny, the nature of humanity) under its gaunt and effective story (primarily in the first two) and then progressively loses all that for increasing action/special effects bluster. Technically, the movie is fine, but I feel that it's lacking the scope that embedded in its potential.<br/><br/>It just doesn't seem to live up to what it could be and fumbles more than a few times to observant viewers. However, in terms of muscular action sequences and special effects, the film delivers and so it does stand as an effective summer blockbuster, great for audiences looking to escape the heat and get a couple thrills. But it's still a notable let down in terms of the legacy and cinematic storytelling. You can pass on this, but it does make for a decent distraction, if that's what you're looking for. 6/10."
"robb6788","6","1","2","27 May 2009"," Disappointing
","I went to see this movie with high hopes. The trailers were very enticing. Looked like it was back to the days of superb film making in action flicks. I was wrong. Not only is Terminator Salvation average it pulls the franchise down a notch or two. It starts off with a very good battle sequence. Bale as John Connor attacks a Skynet outpost. At the outpost we find a new character. Marcus who is a Terminator infiltrator with a twist. He doesn't know he is NOT human. The story goes on from there with Marcus trying to figure out where he fits in and John Connor searches for his father. The main problems with this movie are the story is just a bunch of action scenes featuring the terminators and their vehicles like they were launching a new toy line. They look like they are designed for novelty and as a f/x extravaganza than to serve the purpose of just doing their job to capture or kill humans. There is also a few sequences of John Connor fighting terminators in hand to hand combat. Which is laughable and lessens the intimidation and fear the terminator used instill in previous movies as the perfect killing machine. Overall its not real terrible but its not worth going to see unless its matinée on a rainy day. But Im sure for those who remember the standards cameron set with Terminator and T2 this certainly pales in comparison. Don't believe the hype."
"fanofbatman-1","6","1","2","26 May 2009"," T4: Salvation not the worst Terminator.
","I can safely say that Terminator Salvation isn't the worst Terminator movie: that honor goes to Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines. Rather, this is the second worst Terminator movie. Sam Worthington was really good as Marcus Wright, but most of the other cast had their problems. Anton Yelchin did okay, but he just isn't Kyle Reese. Christian Bale had that irritating Batman grumbling voice going again (muhmuhmah!) and everybody else seemed terrified of sharing the screen with him. This movie packs plenty of thrills, and that's the reason you go to see this type of movie (unless you're a movie critic). The effects are pretty good, especially when compared to X-Men Origins: Wolverine. While this isn't the best movie of the summer and got beaten by Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian at the box office, Terminator Salvation is worth seeing in the theater or waiting for the Director's Cut on DVD and Blu-Ray. The PG-13 rating isn't a problem, but the film could have had more in it had it been Rated R. Thanks for reading this review."

","At last we have the long anticipated fourth installment of the ""Terminator"" franchise. Has it been worth the wait? The answer to that question is one part ""yes"", and one part ""well..maybe"". This one is set after the nuclear war at the end of T3, in the year 2018 to be exact, and the war between humans and the Skynet computer system is going at full-tilt.<br/><br/>There are several different plot lines that don't really come together until the film's third act. The first centers on resistance leader John Connor (Christian Bale), who is involved in planning a major offensive against the machines but is also confronted by the dilemma of how to save the humans held prisoner at the Skynet facility that is to be his target. The second plot line centers on the mysterious Marcus Wright (Sam Robinson) and his journey from the ruins of Los Angeles to the HQ where Connor is based. The third plot introduces us to the teenage Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn's character from the first film) and his adventures with and without Wright. Finally, there is a half-developed love story between Wright and a pilot for the resistance played by Moon Bloodgood.<br/><br/>It is no surprise that the action scenes are what consistently work best in this film, particularly in the first hour and in the climactic battle. Some of the chase scenes are simply breathtakingly exciting and the various machines that the characters have to battle are just awesome. The bleak post-nuclear landscape is strikingly depicted also. The middle part of the film sags quite badly however and the love story between Wright and Bloodgood seems forced and an obstacle to the progress of the bigger plot (which is pretty good otherwise). Another problem is that both Bale and Robinson bring a curious lack of charisma to their characters. It's hard to care about them and they both lack some of the humanity and vulnerability that made the previous films so exciting. All in all, this is a great popcorn movie and well worth seeing on the big screen. However it does not capture quite the same oomph that characterized it's predecessors."

","I walked into Terminator Salvation with an open mind hoping to enjoy this new addition to the Terminator series, but I really did not feel that it delivered as well as it could have. The first problem I had was the pg-13 rating really made it feel like a watered down version of the series. The story was good enough but there is so much jumping around it really doesn't feel like there a lot of character development. As far as explosions and CGI goes this movie delivers well in that category but, the real problem I had with this movie was the choice of actors. I mean why the hell is Common a supporting actor in this movie? Christian Bale has delivered some damn good performances in his time, but I literally burst into hysterics at one point in the movie at him screaming like three words, You'll know what I mean when if you watch it. OK so it was entertaining yes, it better F**king be with that kind of budget, but all I'm trying to say is I found myself laughing and making fun of this movie more than being captivated and absorbed into the experience it was presenting. A fun watch but does not serve justice to the previous Terminator films."

","I'm a big fan of the Terminator movies, so this movie was very disappointing. Sadly i found T4 to be not much more, than a bunch of action sequences and explosions. Which would be fine for a summer action movie, but none of it is exciting or gripping. Terminator 2, was one of the most brilliant Sci-Fi movies of it's time and for all time, because James Cameron combined, a great cast, with a thrilling storyline, and edge of your seat action. Every scene felt important, and you were dying to know how it would end. Sitting through Terminator Salvation, i found myself simply wondering when it would end?? Not caring much about the plot or the characters that were entangled in it.. Christian Bale does a good job in the role of John Conner. He has the charisma and presence of a man you believe could lead soldiers into battle against insurmountable odds, but the plot itself is just not interesting enough for you to really get that involved in his character's, journey. In T1 and T2, the acting, the action, the ultimate journey you were taken on, all flowed so perfectly. That isn't the case in this movie..

","I gotta say that going in to the movie i was skeptical about the film but hell its a terminator. The movie is for sure packed with action. The special effects stand out so much because they are far superior to any of the pseudo action movies that have been out recently. The acting in the movie is good but the movie seemed to be carried by their performances and the FX. There was something lacking though. The story was OK but something was off. I would have to say the direction seemed to be on a novice level. There were moments that could have gotten cut. One of the biggest problems i had with the movie is that this is supposed to be an R rated movie because of the subject matter. Robots killing people for the hell of it in a post apocalyptic world is not a kid friendly movie, so why try to be kid friendly. The third movie got that right at least. Some of the homages paid to the originals are cool. But i think they did over do it at times which always takes away from originality. The movie gets an A for effort but a C- for actual quality."

","Why did they sell the franchise to Warner Bros.? Christian Bale is a terrible selection for John Connor. He doesn't look/act like the John connor depicted in the previous movies at all. And by the way the actual John Connor character was meant to be lame by one leg as shown in Terminator 1, 2, and 3. I was a little disappointed with the loop-holes in Terminator 3, but overall it was a decent enough movie. But this one is pure garbage. I can't believe I wasted my money on this pile of trash.

Sam Worthington did a really good job playing the role of an outsider from named Marcus who is trying to find someone he knew a while back.

"elainew32","5","2","7","22 May 2009"," Disappointing; go see Star Trek instead
","Okay, I was all primed, because I have read that this one is the best one yet; even went to a specific Thursday afternoon showing, because it was going to be shown on the Ultrascreen. Well, I'm beginning to think I'm not cut out for the average 2009 action adventure movie, because it seems like it was too loud and too much destruction and too little of anything else, but, hey, the new Star Trek wasn't this way! It was great and there was a lot of great action, but there was also human drama going on.<br/><br/>The movie starts out in 2003 with a guy, Marcus Wright, who was on death row, and was being persuaded to give his body to science, which he agreed to do, if he could get a kiss from the scientist (played by a bald Helena Bonham Carter). It shows him undergoing his execution by lethal injection, then flashes forward in time to 2018. He comes out of a pit of mud, naked, and resurrected in the midst of the Machine vs. Man war, but appears to be human. Now if you have seen the previews, then you will know that a little later, he has some metal showing on his face, but still proclaims he is human. <br/><br/>The other main part of the story is that Kyle Reese, who will later go back to the past and will actually have sex with Sarah Connor and become John's father, is only a teenager and is also hiding from the machines, and has to be saved so he can go back and create John. Kyle is played by Anton Yelchin, a Russian-born, American raised actor, now 20, who also plays Chekhov in the new Star Trek movie, and very well, I might add; but it is hard to imagine this character being the guy who went back in time to save Sarah Connor; it was a total disconnect for me. That Kyle Reese had a charisma and a presence that is hard to imagine coming out of this guy in his future, but this part of the story didn't get developed; he didn't really do much here except get captured. Marcus Wright has brought the information that Kyle Reese and a whole lot of other humans are captive at the main Skynet headquarters in San Francisco. So both Connor and Wright want to go to San Fran to infiltrate Skynet, Connor, to liberate the humans, and Wright to find out what happened to him, how he ended up here in the future.<br/><br/>During several of the sequences, we see lots of Terminators, of the old T-600 class (the ones like Terminator I), but we also see a new class of machines that looks like they were taken right out of Transformers.. They also have some ships that spot humans, that reminded me of smaller Millennium Falcons out of Star Wars. And there were some cool, crazy motorcycle/driver machines with guns that could really chase people down—the best machine we haven't seen before. All in all, I thought it was fairly entertaining, but in the end I was disappointed that not much was accomplished, and that they left it wide open for a sequel, which I really don't want to see now, because nothing much happened in this one! I guess if John Connor hasn't sent Kyle Reese back in time yet to save his mother from the first Terminator, then this must be early in the time sequence, and a long time away from the finish. . .perfect for dribbling out many more sequels, but basically, not much happens except the introduction of Marcus Wright, who I thought was the most interesting character in this movie. John Connor really didn't do much, a total waste of Christian Bale's talent.<br/><br/>One of the disturbing things was trying to follow the plot, as they kept shifting back and forth between John Connor and Marcus Wright. The two guys, each outfitted in stark looking military garb with short hair and scars and wounds, etc. looked too much alike. After Marcus had the steel showing in his face, it was easier to keep them straight, but I had to see the steel to be sure.<br/><br/>I think you can see that I have mixed feelings about the whole thing, but I'm sure the fans will love it. Even Arnie had personality as a robot by Terminator II (even as we laughed at his Austrian accent!) And in Transformers, the good robots also had personalities, especially ""Bee"", the one that was also Sam Witwicky's car! I don't know, it just left me feeling kind of empty, whereas I loved the new Star Trek so much, I went back and saw it again last night! I expected to be kind of numb to a totally new redone Star Trek, and I expected to love the new Terminator, but it turned out the other way around."

","I don't do it that often, but I went to a theater to watch this movie when it came out. I had fairly high expectations because THE TERMINATOR (1984) and TERMINATOR 2: JUDGMENT DAY (1991) are two of the greatest action movies ever made and have been two of my all-time favorites for many years. The third installment in the series, TERMINATOR 3: RISE OF THE MACHINES (2003), even though not on par with the first two movies in the franchise, was still quite enjoyable. TERMINATOR: SALVATION (2009) however was a major disappointment for me. It's really one of the worst movies (if not THE worst movie) I have ever seen in theater. The plot is ridiculous, there are no likable characters like in the other Terminator movies, and director McG actually managed to get Christian Bale, who usually is a great actor, to deliver a terrible acting performance. Yes, this movies sucks."

"Rishi_B","10","3","15","22 May 2009"," Salvages a lost franchise
","This series was in serious jeopardy after the terrible T3 of 2003. The characters, mythology, and script were mistreated, there was no atmosphere and the film felt like a joke.<br/><br/>This film is the complete opposite of that. This is the first Terminator film that isn't just a rehash of the first. This is also the first Terminator film without Arnold Schwarzenegger's direct involvement. Gone are the cheesy one-liners and chase/escape plot. Instead, we are in the future. 2018. Post-judgment day. The film has been given excessive silver treatment to instill an eerie, apocalyptic feel, and we are instantly drawn into this ugly world.<br/><br/>The cinematography is amazing. Camera-work and framing are top notch and the action never fails to thrill. Some may find fault with the movie's pace; I can't say for certain, but it seems as if there's never more than ten minutes in between action scenes. For an action junkie like myself that's wonderful. For someone who expects more to a movie than thrills, it may be a problem.<br/><br/>But this is not your father's terminator. At least, not completely. Unlike T2 the deeper themes and emotional depth are more or less relegated to the background. When these scenes do appear they work well; Knowledge of the first two films greatly enhances the experience however. Many nods exist toward the characterization of Kyle Reese (played brilliantly by Anton Yelchin) from the first, and the father/son relationship he is engaged in with Christian Bale's John Connor. Determined and wary, Connor is one of the more human characters in the film, as the film serves to explain how and why he captured the Resistance's hearts. ""Fanservice"" may be the term of choice, as dialogue, musical cues, and more all help establish this as a true Terminator film, in line with the first two.<br/><br/>Newcomer Sam Worthington's Marcus Wright has the most intriguing character arc in the film; half of the film's emotional and literary payoffs exist due to his excellent portrayal. Other than these three characters however, most humans in the film are more or less one-note. This is where both the writing and McG's direction are called into question. This is not a James Cameron film; there are bad lines and (consequently) bad delivery. Perhaps a few more takes could have improved the film; there are no bad actors in the film, just intermittent weak performances. Nevertheless, these moments are few and do not hurt the movie to a significant degree.<br/><br/>The worst note is in fact found in the score, as Danny Elfman unfortunately fails to reach the jarring mechanical heights of Brad Fiedel's original work. The iconic drums of the original Terminator theme are retained, but the emotional main chords are nowhere to be found; Instead a similar but less powerful score reminds the audience of the original's greatness, but fails to deliver it. Including the original would have made a world of difference, as this is the lone blemish which serves to separate this film from feeling like a true Terminator.<br/><br/>McG has finally reached credibility as an excellent action director. The few character moments are done well, and the practical and CGI effects are both utilized to the fullest. The vision of an apocalyptic world and a war between man and machine from Cameron's films has been fully realized. Faithful to the past films and also introducing a few new subtle twists, Terminator Salvation offers an engaging watch... as long as you have the heart for it."

Whoever wrote this script, did he watch the other 3 movies before he wrote this disaster? I did like the landscape of the cities, but other than that i thought the story line was terrible, i thought the acting was terrible, the fight scenes with the terminators and humans were pathetic.<br/><br/>The huge terminators were the only thing that was vastly unique, oh and the motorcycles were cool, but other than that i wasn't impressed.<br/><br/>And how does one guy just walk into Skynet? I mean cmon, if it was that easy, the war should of been over along time ago.<br/><br/>John Connor was supposed to be the leader of the resistance, yet he was taking orders from command??? Seems to be he should of been the one in charge of all the other resistance groups instead of just a leader of one resistance group.<br/><br/>I guess maybe i just expected a lot more, maybe i had in my own mind what it would of been like.<br/><br/>This is a typical Hollywood sequel that ignores the art of a classic film and rushes out sequels to capitalize financially on the original films popularity.<br/><br/>Could of been done a lot better in my opinion"

I know, Arnold is not in Salvation, he was too busy being governor of the People's Republic of California. Christian Bale was great as John Conner and Sam Worthington was good as the terminator. Yes, there are some cringe inducing moments where they tried to dial up the 'member berries, but they are easy to overlook. I, for one, enjoyed watching a Terminator that takes place after judgement day when the war between man and machines is on full display.
In the end, yes, it could've been better and this could've been solved by continuing this story line with Christian Bale as John Conner. Salvation is way better than the forgettable T3 and far more superior to the dumpster fire that was Genisys. I really don't have much hope for Dark Fate."

","Have you ever wondered what the private parts of the terminators are hiding, and are these movie characters sexually functional? Even if this did not come to your mind while watching Schwarzenegger in the second and Kristanna Loken in the third film, the series ""Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles "" very clearly insinuates this issue. The creators of the fourth film seem to have succumbed to a decades-long sexual frustration and decided to brutally rape the franchise. If you have not seen this garbage yet, I advise you to suppress curiosity in order to keep this cult franchise in a good memory.<br/><br/>Writers did not have any idea in which direction they will develop the story, and even who are the main protagonists. The movie is two hours of completely meaningless noisy action that does not lead anywhere. The characters are two-dimensional and totally uninteresting, acting mediocre, and even Christian Bale in the role of John Connor does not stand out from mediocrity. John Connor is practically supporting role and Bale's performance is characterless and bored, as if he was forced to play in the movie against his will. Arnold Schwarzenegger's cameo is a pretty insipid and redundant detail, and Helena Bonham Carter appears just briefly.<br/><br/>To avoid being hater who sees only negative things, I have to mention pretty good performance of Sam Worthington in leading role, and the scene in which Bale says legendary ""I'll Be Back"" and then we hear the song from the first movie ""You Could Be Mine"", although pathetic, is quite a successful trick to provoke nostalgia in the audience.

Yeah, I don't hold that against the guy, but the remixes have been pretty funny. I actually do like what they do with this movie. It's mostly how they do something different by having the film set entirely in the future. You could call me a ""Terminator"" fan as I probably love the series as much as anyone else. The best scene is probably when they fight the underwater robots. That shows off true creativity.<br/><br/>I was just kind of disappointed how the climax turned out. It was by no means bad, but I guess with all the tension built up, I was expecting some huge battle between the humans and robots. Instead, it was just two Terminators fighting, which is more or less what we've seen in the other movies. This movie seemed to have the right length. The main problem I have is that it does comes off as rather pointless. It's by no means an awful movie. It just came off as pretty forgettable to me. I guess there's technically nothing that good or bad about it. The other films are better.<br/><br/>I find the third movie to be better than this, which did better with critics. It captured the spirit of the first two movies better. This moves a little slowly at times and the moral is a pretty obvious one.

","While not technically a sequel, this fourth vision of the Terminator universe recaptures the dark, brooding impact of the original film while maintaining character growth and depth. Christian Bale brings a new dimension to John Connor, giving us both the leader we knew he would be, yet the man who is still finding his potential. Sam Worthington is exceptional in the role of Marcus Wright, providing us with another key to the development of the T-800 / T-101 unit we have seen in the past films. Anton Yelchin must have studied Michael Biehn's character very closely. He looks and sounds like a young Kyle Reese, right down to the inflections of his voice. We have a believable setting and characters that we knew in their younger days now developing into the characters we hoped they would be. To no surprise, the Terminator appears in the final scenes of the film, but this time it is a digital version of Arnold Schwarzenegger that is quickly reduced to the skeletal frame. As in the previous films, the final battle occurs in a factory setting, only this time it is in the factory where Skynet is assembling Terminators.

","I really don't understand why this didn't do better. The chief complaint seems to be that it was not like the other 3 films. My response to that is this - How many times can we watch a guy go back in time to save John Connor before it gets old? The 3rd film was clearly just cashing in on the franchise's popularity (though it was still a fun romp). To this film's credit the makers at least had the guts to try something new and take things in a different direction. However, thematically it deals with issues similar to T2 - What makes us human, the sanctity of human life. It even raises the danger of becoming like your enemy, which is very topical these days. My chief complaint is that it only touches on these issues. Otherwise it is a solid addition to the franchise and a solid sci-fi action flick in its own right. Is it better than T2? No. Is it better than T3? By far. The plot is interesting enough and nicely plays around with the alternate timelines concept. It has decent action and acting. Sam Worthington outshines everyone else though by far (Sorry Mr. Bale, I still worship you as a God though, a Batman God). The cinematography is excellent. They really captured the post-apocalyptic vibe with that. The score is good. It creates new themes while still throwing in the classic Terminator theme in here and there. There are some nice homages to the first two films. Accept the fact that there is no time travel in this one and forget it is directed by a guy who calls himself ""McG"" and enjoy it on its own merits."

Helena Bonham Carter explains the Manchurian Situation via a Marlon Jor-El Brando holo-exposition - coincidentally, like a Batman Villain - that no one asked for and would have served her purpose better to have not explained. Bale is a brilliant actor, a chameleon, an artisan; Sam Worthington is a block of sexy wood - and so, like the original films, the coolest role went to the guy who could act the LEAST.<br/><br/>So have they invented time-travel yet? Didn't machines send the Governor back first, forcing John Connor to send Kyle back to stop him? Which would mean MACHINES created time travel. Thanks, Diebold! Humans couldn't find the time to invent it, not with all that hiding and skulking in portable underground labs covered in poo? Trying to tie it all in with canon, Connor narrates at the end that ""the war is just beginning,"" meaning that war Kyle Reese rasps about in THE TERMINATOR, even though the Schwarzenegger Terminator was like a toy soldier compared to the techno design of the Worthingtonator, which was so technologically covert it didn't even know it was a Manchurian Terminator. And like George Lucas's prequel-abominations-with-better-effects, the paradoxes and anomalous plotting of writers John Brancato and Michael Ferris comes back 'round to bite them in the butt.<br/><br/>The irony of SALVATION is that it is continually yammering about ""strong hearts"" delineating humans from machines and ""what it means to be human"" and all manner of poignant story element so obviously cribbed from Screen writing For Dummies - and lacks everything it yammers about.<br/><br/>Bale brings his Batman rasp and boundless temper; Bryce Dallas Howard brings her three unnecessary names and a spunky red coiffure; looking like Billy Bibbit from CUCKOO'S NEST, Anton Yelchin is young Kyle Reese (in one of those many nods to TERMINATOR fans that means nothing to first-time viewers); Moon Bloodgood brings a sexy disposition for metal man meat; Michael Ironside is Bad Guy emeritus; Helena Bonham Carter goes name to name with Bryce Dallas Howard but beats out Howard on looking like a bloodless horse junkie (i.e. like Helena Bonham Carter); and a bodybuilt guy with a face like an Arnold tips another hat to the fanboys.<br/><br/>The production values are as scorching as Bale's temper. There is an amazing unbroken tracking shot 360 degrees around a helicopter in distress, that then tracks INTO the helicopter (John Connor piloting) and stays with the action as the helicopter crashes and lands upside down. John Connor crawls from the wreck and sees a mushroom cloud in the distance, blasted radar dishes littering the foreground and middle background. We know this is all green screen, yet it takes us right into the murderous battle heat of Termytown. Then it gets stupid immediately - as a skeletal Terminator grabs John Connor and throws him. Let me get this straight: this steel-belted Terminator's one directive is to terminate humans, yet having the opportunity to simply clasp its mighty metal claw around Connor's neck from behind and asphyxiate him or snap his neck, it opts to grab him by the shoulder and throw him? <br/><br/>Which proves that McG (the McDirector) has a great grasp of constructing action scenes - but don't let him near your story. Unless you're two bitches who wrote TERMINATOR 3. See how it all comes around and bites us in the butt?"
"lekgolah","8","1","3","22 May 2010"," A throughly entertaining action film from start to finish!
","I watched this film with low expectations. Friends of mine have commented on how bad it was and the fact that it was directed by the person behind Charlie's Angels 2, I had little to look forward to. <br/><br/>However I found the film to be non-stop action with a story that was not perfect but served its purpose. Christian Bale is excellent putting everything he had into the role of John Connor. Sam Worthington also gave a great performance. Its a shame though that the marketing spoils the major plot twist in the film so you already know too much if you have seen the trailers.<br/><br/>The action kept my attention throughout the entire film and there are a lot of action scenes. The CGI and sound effects are really impressive. It shows you how far we have come since The Terminator in terms of effects. Although there is one fight in the rain that did feel clichéd and the film could have done without it. Despite that one scene, the action was always entertaining and the final fight was great to watch without spoiling anything. <br/><br/>Despite a lot of interesting scenes such as early on when Christian Bale jumps into the scene from an aircraft, the film does have its flaws. Most notably Common, who is one of the better rapper-turn-actors as he has some bad dialogue and is only there to increase the amount of recognisable actors involved. I also felt that they could have done more with Michael Ironside's character. Some of the lines from the previous Terminator films are also here (i'll be back) take you out the film.<br/><br/>Die hard fans might not be pleased with everything that happens in the film but for everyone else this is a great action film. A vast improvement over Terminator 3 thanks to great acting, action and a good story."

","TS has been running on a constant loop on one of the movie channels here the past few nights. I've settled in after work and let this spectacle wash over me time after time - so after several viewings let me tell everyone the show is DAZZLING. The action is big and bad and occurs for the most part in broad daylight. You'll be rooting for the team to come through when all seems lost. And of course Connor, Wright, Star, Reece and the gang really let Skynet have it with an explosion that rocks the remnants of the Western Seaboard. The T-600, hydro-bots and of course the 'fusion' Terminator (Marcus Wright) are all excellent additions to the franchise. This is sci-fi at its' finest, folks."
"giuliocc","5","1","3","27 February 2010"," The franchise should be terminated
","No one seems to be able to make a good scifi movie like James Cameron. This interpretation was disappointing because the director McG seemed to draw upon Mad Max, and the relies on an expensive set in the desert for most of this movie. <br/><br/>The plot really has bad flow as does the editing. It chops and changes and makes a few too many assumptions for the audience to follow easily. The lack of depth in the development of the plot makes the movie very hollow in substance as compared to Terminator 1 and 2. I would have thought now that the Terminator franchise is more than 20 years old, that directors do not make the same mistakes.<br/><br/>I am a keen SciFi fan, and found many times wondering how the main characters made their decisions or managed their reasoning. It's a technically driven movie, it seems that the writers and the director didn't sit down and think through the characters more thoroughly. The ending is really disappointing to. There is no ""closure"", and it seems to leave the story open for T5, if anyone dares to have a go. <br/><br/>The terminator series is a meaty subject that should provide any competent director and writer with enough material to create an engaging scifi flick. But don't expect that in this case. <br/><br/>Please Please someone terminate this franchise! Or ask James Cameron to finish it off for good!"
"bentamachan","7","1","3","2 January 2010"," A good time had by all (except Skynet of course)
","Overall...a good movie. I watched on DVD worried that it would be like Star Trek... a disappointment. But it was much better than expected. It had drama, suspense, and enough links into the original stories that you could enjoy it as a continuation (or is it prequel)?<br/><br/>It's a slightly strange movie however in that it deviates slightly (accelerated development of sky-net), and the role of Marcus is a strange secondary story that doesn't really start anywhere, and doesn't really conclude. The ending is a bit pat therefore.<br/><br/>Overall there were some excellent bits in there... but also by the end, you're not exactly knowing John Connor any better than when you started, and as such his struggle at the end is less than thrilling. Also - the question has to be asked? Why did he not seek out Kyle before now? (but that's verging on a spoiler)."
"cslintner","9","1","3","16 December 2009"," Thought it was quite possibly the best of the four.
","I was quite mesmerized with the action and for the most part the acting in this movie. I thought the Marcus character was very well played by Sam Worthington. Marcus is the missing link. We all knew we did it to ourselves from the earlier movies, but the idea that we not only created Skynet, but provided it with the prototype for the Terminator. I disagree with the negative comments I have read about this movie. What were they expecting? The other movies have been saturated with impossible action scenes and bad acting. Terminator 2? Not one good actor. The truck in the storm drain? That's not the point. I was entertained for the entire movie. I can't say that for just any movie."
"Starbuck823","6","1","3","13 December 2009"," Decent film even with its flaws
","OK, so McG did an OK job. I mean, its hard to top James Cameron, especially when both of his Terminator movies had ground breaking affects for the time. I think the problem is that he wasn't able to create the emotional connection that was apparent in the first two. He did a great job in the references to the previous films, and was more true to the JC style of the Terminator, but I'm not sure if it was purely his direction or the writer's fault, but some of the emotional stuff (aka, Marcus romance) was a bit corny.<br/><br/>Christian Bale makes us forget the tragic Conner that was in T3 (thank goodness), and pulls off the character nicely. Worthington did a great job - he showed characteristics of a terminator only when you looked closely. I rather liked Conner's wife (Dallas-Howard) too - they did a good job of making her a bit of a leader with John, rather than just a wife. She was heaps better than Claire Danes, who I found rather insipid in T3. Thumbs up to the kid who played Reese - I think this kid did a great job in creating the younger Reese, and showing us how he becomes the future Reese we have seen.<br/><br/>I'd say that the story is Marcus rather than John Conner. I didn't mind that so much, but I would have liked to see more of the other supporting characters and the life of the post judgment day world. Can't decide if I liked the soundtrack or not. I think it did better when the music was a bit more understated, but when it jumped in all loud and obvious, it actually took away from the scene.<br/><br/>I read that there is another one in the works. I'm hoping it is not a time travel one (I read its a possibility) but rather focuses on the ending of the war, and creating a bit of a conclusion to the story.<br/><br/>Overall, I'd say this is a good movie - doesn't top the original two but is defiantly worthy being part of the Terminator franchise."

","I had heard nothing positive about terminator salvation after its release and avoided it after the debacle that was terminator 3. But..... I was expecting an action driven flick about humans kicking robot ass. The film delivered! this film was a different animal from the first two installments in the franchise, but really to see the same plot again would have put me off entirely. I'm not sure but i think the director is hamburgular's cousin or a strange white rapper, but i don't really care what he directed before, I was sucked in and taken along for the ride.<br/><br/>Thanks for restoring my faith in the business of catching a sequel. oh the ending is contrived and completely nonsensical, but fun all the same! well worth braving the fear!"
"brando647","7","1","3","8 December 2009"," Less Disappointing than RISE OF THE MACHINES
","After revisiting McG's venture into the war against machines, I find I may have been a little too harsh on TERMINATOR SALVATION. I was pretty brutal in my discussions with friends on the movie, but now it doesn't seem nearly as bad. Maybe it's because I've also rewatched WOLVERINE and TRANSFORMERS 2 and realized this wasn't even close to be the worst movie of 2009. In fact, as long as you're just looking for a good action film, this does it's job and manages to entertain (albeit, brainlessly). Continuing the canon of the first three films, the movie finds John Connor (Christian Bale) rising through the ranks of the resistance against the machines, though there are still many doubters toward his ""prophet"" status. Meanwhile, Marcus Wright (Sam Worthington) reawakens after 15 years to discover there's been some major changes, to himself and to society. Together, Connor and Wright must cooperate if they want to rescue a young Kyle Reese (Anton Yelchin) from Skynet before they can alter Connor's history.<br/><br/>As is generally the case with the TERMINATOR franchise, the plot isn't too complicated. In this film, the real stars are the special effects and CGI. Being that the film occurs during the war with Skynet, we're treated to a nice collection of new machines, ranging from the snakelike Hydrobots to the massive Harvester, and of course the T-800s (fresh off the factory line). The effects were incredible and the money was obviously well spent in bringing the war to life. The variety of killer machines make for some great action pieces, particularly Connor's climactic battle against a familiar face. Focus on the action spectacles in the film and I doubt you'll find yourself disappointed in the end.<br/><br/>Christian Bale continues to prove he's got box office power, especially in the summer, as he adds another iconic character to his resume as John Connor. He isn't given much to work with, and he spends the majority of the movie growling, grumbling, or yelling but he's still a welcome addition. Sam Worthington does a fine job and I'm pretty sure, if the trailers hadn't ruined his character's major development before the movie was ever released, his performance would've been that much more impressive as it left the audience wondering ""is he or isn't he?"" before his big reveal in the second act. Rounding out the cast are some shallow, but decent enough supporting performances from Bryce Dallas Howard (replacing Claire Danes in the role as Kate Brewster), Moon Bloodgood being that perfect mix of tough/beautiful as a fighter pilot, and Anton Yelchin who, while he's been in some major roles in STAR TREK and TERMINATOR, still needs some time to grow on me.<br/><br/>In all honestly, this isn't as terrible a movie as it's been made out to be. It's gotten a pretty bad reputation and it bombed at the box office, but as long as you don't go into the film taking it seriously (the plot holes won't let you), you can still find enough entertainment value. If nothing else, at least we can take solace in the fact that it wasn't as lame as TERMINATOR 3."

I know, I know, that was a weird example, but hey, I did warn you that I'm an Aussie. Getting back to this wonderful flick.....Christian Bale, although not my main-man as an Actor, is one of the most talented, diversified and consistent actors today. And to see Our Australian-made Sam Worthington starring beside such talents as Bale, jolted me into realising how good Sam can be. He has been most underrated Internationally thus far, but here in ""DownUnder"" we are certainly aware of his prowess. ""Terminator 4: Salvation"" is by far the BEST of all the Terminator films.....even with Bales' having a shot at Arnies' ""hasta la vista baby"" with his ""I'll be back"".....I enjoyed this film so much.

"thinker1691","9","1","3","4 December 2009"," "" The Ability to love with your heart is the Difference between Humans and Machines ""
","In the center of all things is the human heart, so said the poet. For this fantastic futuristic movie called "" Terminator Salvation "" it is also the thrust of the film. Anyone who has kept up with this expanding series, knows why this story keeps evolving. In this episode we have an adult John Connor (Christian Bale) knee deep in the resistance fight with the growing problem of 'Sky-Net.' Although the characters themselves are a problem for any new audience, it is nevertheless easy to accept that it begins in our day and age with a condemned convict named Marcus Wright (Sam Worthington) about to be executed and ends up in the future as a Cyborg creation at the hands of Dr. Serena Kogan (Helena Bonham Carter). Here he meets Kyle Reese (Anton Yelchin) and thus begins a spinning and often dizzying time-warping vortex which inexorable leads to the future of the world. Regardless if one follows it closely or not, the movie itself provides enough entertainment to keep one glued to the screen. The exciting, drama, and often explosive scenes are so action packed as to wow any audience. The intertwine story of Sara Connors and her futurist family which feuds with unstoppable machines of death is incredible and fun to watch. Much credit is given to the talented cast and their characters as to ensure a great movie. This film is dedicated to the late Stan Winston and therein lies the excellent tribute of a film which is sure to become a sci-fi Classic. ****"

End of war.</li></ul><br/><br/>Seriously - that was the whole premise of the T1-3 movies, so why oh why do we see:<br/><br/><ul><li>Skynet finds Kyle Reese - Skynet transports Kyle Reese to a cost prison in some base - Skynet lures John Connor into said (non-heavily defended base), so they can kill him - Skynet sends one, yes one Terminator to kill John Connor.

I think I am one of the few that also loved the Sarah Connor Chronicles and Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines. I likes T3 simply because it changed everything that we thought we knew about the terminator movies, that we should have seen from the start. I didn't until the end of T3. TSCC was gong to semi fill in the blanks, but not enough people liked it so they canceled it after only two years, less than 30 episodes between the two. But back to the subject: DVD time. Why is Wolverine out, and why are Monsters vs Aliems and Aliens in the Attic and Ice Age 3, all coming out so far before Terminator Salvaton?

"insomniac_rod","9","1","3","6 September 2009"," Definitely, Popcorn Terminator is not a bad thing!
","I had high expectations towards this movie for two reasons: 1) It's a Terminator movie and should follow the basic storyline 2) The cast is strong and the trailer looked great<br/><br/>My expectations were fulfilled to the point that I can say I'm a satisfied Terminator fan.<br/><br/>This time visuals take a leading role and leave substance in the plot on a second level, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. The plot is still interesting and follows perfectly the events of the trilogy while adding a new sense to the Terminator franchise.<br/><br/>Let's keep in mind that this is still a Hollywood film and that means we HAVE to see movie-defining or memorable moments plus some clichéd situation (the old lady taking care of the likable mute girl, the relationship between the robot and the hot sexy girl, the heart doning, for example). But still some moments will become instant classics: the new Termiantor based on Arnold was a moment that literally had me shivering! It was great, I mean, I almost crapped in happiness. <br/><br/>The score is just great and anytime I listen to the trademark Terminator them I get really excited and happy. <br/><br/>The f/x are simply spectacular, I can't remember a movie of this kind with such adrenaline and impressive f/x. The gigant robot chasing, the highway action sequence, the final war, the shootings, the mototerminators, etc. are prime examples of how you can make a visually powerful movie. You won't regret if you get this movie for it's visuals.<br/><br/>Also, on a great plus side, we get a dreadful atmosphere that will make you feel part of the Post-Apocalyptic situation. It feels lonely and you can truly smell death through spectacular settings. Nice work.<br/><br/>McG demonstrates he's a specialist Director in Action. He relies his work on intrepid but solid camera angles and adds his personal POV through some situations. He needs to follow some previous rules established in part 1 and 2 and he does it perfectly. <br/><br/>The acting is top notch. Christian Bale demonstrates he's one of the most talented actors of his generation. The guy truly feels his character! He's just badass, emotive, and delivers a magnificent performance. Sam Worthington is very likable and also delivers a badass performance that is the equilibrium to Bale's. Moon Bloodgood is as hot as her name. Bryce Dalls Howard looks sexy and acts fine when she has the chance. The rest of the cast is just good.<br/><br/>The new characters add a new whole dimension to the series because now we are lead to believe that machines have developed feelings and that we're not better than them on that aspect. Unlike ""Judgement Day"", here the new prototype has renewed feelings and even has the faculty to demonstrate he's a kind robo-human being without knowing it.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a visually stunning experience that completes adequately with an interesting plot and non-stop quality action. <br/><br/>There's a war between humanity and machines and I wanna be a part of it! Bring it on! By far, the most competent blockbuster hit of the year."
"russian_kettle","7","1","3","4 September 2009"," don't follow the crowed
","Now I don't know why people hate this film so much. I happen to be a HUGE terminator fan and know everything about it and I thought that this film wasn't as bad as people say! McG a guy I had no idea who this person was until I heard of this film, of course as soon as I heard about him I looked him up and I differently wasn't impressed with the films that he had made. In fact what films he has made? Because there are barely any on there.<br/><br/>But like every director everyone starts from the bottom, and this was his chance to make his name, and I think he has done a good job on it. He must have been under a lot of pressure about this film being the huge scale of terminator franchise. He did a good job compared to terminator 3. <br/><br/>When I first saw terminator I thought it was so good and then I realised there was a second one, Oh My God! The second one I must have watch 20 30 times and I still watch it, it's so good. When thoughts graphic on the t-1000. So good <br/><br/>Then I heard about a third one I thought to myself, right this is it, this is the one where I can go to my kids and say I was there when that great film came out, what a disappointment. It was alright nowhere near as good as T1 or T2. I'm not going to speak of that film because have no time for it. <br/><br/>Back to the Salvation! <br/><br/>when I walk out the cinema I couldn't get the relief out of me I thought that it was quite good, hell I say it very good, I'm sure there's some fan boy out there reading this going, ""You know nothing William""<br/><br/>Well I do! (Smug face)<br/><br/>It was good OK, I really don't see whets the big problem with this film is apart from Christian's Bale's voice, which I am disappointed in you Bale! ""You're a very good actor Christen stay away from that batman voice!"" I haven't seen public enemy yet but if he hasn't dropped the voice by then I'll kill! <br/><br/>Anyway, the CGI in this film was very good, really good on the Sam Worthington face, and the motor terminator's or whatever their called. So it shows that McG has put a lot of work into this film. Or McG's CGI team did but he put it all together very well<br/><br/>I liked that in this film McG has created some of his own terminators such as the mototerminator. The harvester was very cool and then that's when I though ""that's what you want"" when coming out of a film you want to walk out and go when the harvester came, or when you see the mortorterminator fly under the car that was cool. Which is what you did when you came walking out of T1/ T2 cinema, there something new on both of them , which you had never seen before ! Arnold's T-800 coming out of the fire seeing his robotic body, the T-1000 reforming itself you never had seen that before. I got that from this film!<br/><br/>Sam Worthington who plays Marcus does a really good performance and he kind of steals the show from Christen, when Marcus meets up with Kyle Reese, played by Anton Yelchin does the part so well. There are a few scene where we see Anton plays Kyle so good it was like watching Michael Biehn who played the original Kyle Reese (if you didn't know that stop reading now). <br/><br/>But of course there are down falls, christen Bale being the main one. It was that batman/Bruce Wayne voice which he uses for every American accent, like I said his good actor just needs to get a better/new American voice. There's a bit when Moon Bloodgood, who plays Blair in it, does something really stupid in it and it makes you shout out ""you wouldn't do that!"" So why McG put that in I really don't know! I would say that was a scene that they could have got rid of, or written differently. That's probably why people didn't like it because when you see terminator 1 or 2 you just have no problems with it. There are so many condescending questions in this film, 1 main thing being that in number 1 Kyle Reese tells Sarah Connor they stay hidden during the day and they fight at night? But in this one it's like the opposite? I also think this film would have done a lot better if there wasn't so much advertisement, everywhere you went you would see an advert or a bill bored of terminator salvation and I think people got too hyped for it! While I'm speaking of adverts I think they should have kept the Marcus being a robot out of the trailer making it something to tell your friends. That guy from the trailer is different his not a terminator or is he??? You know it would have been a bit better, my view anyway. <br/><br/>And one big point is, like this review you always remember the bad and not the good. You remember that christen playing the whole angry part again, and Blair doing that stupid thing, or some tiny piece of CGI which wasn't perfected! Remember the good not the bad!<br/><br/>Over all the film was very good film, good CGI, very creative, acting was quite good i.e. Sam Worthington, and compared to Terminator 1 and 2, nowhere near but still very good just not as good as the classic's as per. Go see this film and give it a go!<br/><br/>And remember don't follow the crowed!"

Anyhow, putting that rubbish aside, after finally deciding to go and watch it, and not listening to the rubbish half the idiots on hear chat, i figured lets just go and see for myself. I have to say i was very impressed. i thought the cgi in this movie was on another level and much preferred it to the recent transformers 2 movie. i liked the way each different story line going on in the movie was linked at the end, i thought Christian bale was superb as john conner, and everyone els did a fantastic job on replicating various other characters in the the movie we become so used to in previous terminator movies.

Ably assisted by many others, you get a good and unsentimental action movie which likely sets the scene for more.<br/><br/>The terminator machines are excellent to watch and creative, many a time seeming perfectly real. The settings are apocalyptic and there are a couple of thoughtful moments also.<br/><br/>Give it a try, sit back and enjoy for a great action movie."
"bassfacer","6","1","3","8 August 2009"," A Different Terminator Movie
","Like many, I'm a huge fan of the first 2 Terminator movies. There is no doubt at James Cameron's skilled work at making movies (wish he'd make more). Terminator Salvation succeeds where Termintor 3 fails, in my opinion. The first 2 movies were Cameron's babies, and unfortunately, Terminator 3 was just of a rehash of the first 2 and definitely not done with Cameron's skill, which made it nearly unwatchable.<br/><br/>But, since Terminator 3 was made, and the plot of the war actually happening was opened up, even if the timelines were different, even through all the obvious continuity flaws of the 3rd movie, if a 4th movie were to be made, it would have to be a DIFFERENT movie. This, however, doesn't necessarily mean that it will be a BETTER movie. This film has a different feel and look than the ones before it. It had to be different to show the war. Gone is the time-travel motif of the first 3 movies. There are obvious nods to Mad Max, the recent War of the Worlds, Transformers. As others have said, the acting and script could've been better, but it wasn't terrible. There are some unintentionally corny lines and some predictable moments, especially borrowed from other movies. The Marcus Wright character could've been better written and developed (what exactly did he do to be put on death row?), but I did like the concept of it. There is CG abound, which can be a good thing and a bad thing. CG is becoming more and more realistic. Much more in this film is probably CG than we realize. It makes the movie look more sci-fi than real. Not to mention that it looks like that human technology had advanced after Judgement Day. One of the main continuity flaws I saw was that they never mentioned the ""rubber-skinned"" terminators from the first movie; they just went straight to the Arnie-cyborg (excellent CG cameo, by the way).<br/><br/>Despite its flaws, this movie succeeds in being a post-apocalyptic sci-fi action flick. Even though it doesn't have the skill of the first 2 movies, it's still watchable, especially more watchable than the 3rd movie. The effects and action sequences are top notch. The point of this movie is to have fun watching it. Christian Bale obviously shines. There are also great nods to the first two films. John Connor can still hack into a computer. There is Sarah Connor's (Linda Hamilton's) photo, John listening to his mom's cassette tapes, and even John listening to Guns n Roses.<br/><br/>In the end, even though the script and acting aren't up to par with the previous films, this movie is still fun to watch, not as ridiculous as the 3rd movie, and can still be enjoyed as a popcorn muncher."
"mgayles2005","Null","1","3","20 July 2009"," It took six years to make this film...just think about that.
","Another movie lover named Confused Matthew (you may have heard of him) said something totally on point about ""POTC 3: At Worlds End"". He said that there was no excuse for the film makers to make such a bad sequel when they had all the time, the star power, and the resources to make it good. The same can be said for Terminator: Salvation, an unholy mess of a sequel that begs for James Cameron's help throughout every unwritten, audience insulting minute of it's run time.<br/><br/>Like At Worlds End, the producers, director McG and his screen writers had plenty of time, money and star power to make a tolerable film. But the difference is, they had even more money and more time (six years to be exact). That's enough time to write an entire library of scripts, and it's apparent that they struggled to scribble just one. I imagine it was written with crayons on a napkin moments before being submitted.<br/><br/>The plot is so absent you might as well be watching a documentary on how the film was made, that might be more entertaining. A guy gets executed in 2003, and wakes up in the apocalyptic future, where humanity battles evil robots. He wanders around wondering what the heck is going on, runs into a few resistance fighters, and then John Connor. There is the plot. I couldn't even write a spoiler if I wanted to.<br/><br/>The guy that walks around a lot has a big secret that some evil executive decided to put in the trailer. I guess he forgot that the whole movie is built around the twist. The lesson here future film makers is that you never build a movie around a secret.<br/><br/>After making it pretty clear that there is no plot, the last few minutes are spent trying to make up a plot at the last minute. Like I said before, SIX YEARS TO WRITE ONE. Being a long, plot less, unwritten movie is one thing, but treating the audience like they're stupid is another. This movie earns a spot in action movie hell.<br/><br/>The saving grace is the production values, the CGI robot effects, and one awesome chase scene. If only these things were in a better movie. If only the wasted 200 million dollar budget bought something useful instead of this film, like unemployment checks. Maybe a few of them should go to the producers of this disaster because they're going to need it soon."
"gigan-92","5","1","3","18 July 2009"," Should Not Have Been Released, Really.
","What a disappointment, really. For this film I'm not even going to bother going into details. Whoever this McG is a HORRIBLE director. Where to start, where to start, hmmm.....oh, I know, the complicated plot. Damn, half the time I didn't know what the sh*t was going on and when I did I felt the need to say it was either highly predictable or just plain dumb. To this day I'm still not sure what happened at the terminator base of operations. The characters didn't thrill me at all and I found rather boring really. John Connor's role felt like a bit of an afterthought compared to that cyborg dude, whatever his name was. And oh yeah, WTF?! Christian Bale doing his Batman voice?! I'm starting to think it's a medical condition at this point, seriously. The story simply lacks substance and very little emotion was evoked from this film. The first two, even the third, give off an atmosphere that intrigued and amazed audiences, really giving off several themes actually. Like the endurance of the human soul. The only theme hear is crew's bad writing."
"Leader_Of_The_Sandbox","6","1","3","14 July 2009"," Unfortunately, This is Not Terminator's Salvation Just Yet
","It's not always easy to fill in the shoes of a person(s) that practically revolutionized the art of film-making, in one way or another. Bryan Singer's ""Superman Returns"" was quite awesome, but it wasn't nearly as good as to become the beginning of a whole new series. There was Michael Caton-Jones' ""Basic Instinct 2,"" Ken Finkleman's ""Airplane II,"" and Joe Berlinger's ""Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2,"" all of which weren't even close to the level of success as their predecessors. Even Jonathan Mostow himself tried with ""T3,"" but despite making profits and getting mostly positive critical reception, it was deemed as disappointing because it wasn't on the same level as the first two.<br/><br/>The exceptions are always there. James Cameron's ""Aliens,"" Nicholas Meyer's ""Star Trek II,"" Sylvester Stallone's ""Rocky III,"" Len Wiseman's ""Live Free or Die Hard,"" etc. And then there is ""Terminator Salvation."" Could it be one of those exceptions? Unfortunately, it isn't. . . not even close 'cause it wasn't even better than ""T3.""<br/><br/>PLOT: John Connor, the man fated to be the leader of the Resistance, is trying to find his way to become... well, the leader, of course. The problem is, some people, particularly General Ashdown, doesn't believe in all of the nonsense he's spouting about new T-800s and stuff. Oh, and his wife Kate is with him also, pregnant and just being with him. Meanwhile, Marcus, a former criminal on death row who donated his body to some project by a sick chick, wakes up 15 years in a world filled with much deserts. He's trying to find out what happened and why he's there, while John merely plans and shouts and does nothing interesting.<br/><br/>The main problem with this story is that it's nothing. It's as if the writers slapped it onto the film without any effort. When I heard Paul Haggis, Shawn Ryan, Anthony Zuiker, and Jonathan Nolan were brought in for polishes and rewrites, I literally thought this film would be a hit without a doubt. I mean, with writers like that, how could you make bad film? But trust me, it's bad. For those new to the franchise, the plot doesn't explain and introduce anything. When I watched ""Star Trek,"" I knew nothing about the franchise. That's the beauty of the film; it introduces the franchise to new audiences, while remaining as faithful as possible to its canon. ""TS"" isn't the same.<br/><br/>Furthermore, there are several plot holes and implausible situations (for which suspension of disbelief can't save you from) that are just downright stupid that it's hard not to ignore. On a lighter note, I'm gonna have to say that the entire third act pretty much saved the movie (except for the very end). Arnold appears (it made the fanboy in me squeal), there's this whole big fight that's entertaining, and it's just awesome. So I'll give the film that.<br/><br/>ACTING PERFORMANCES: Thought Christian Bale was badass in ""American Psycho"" and ""Batman Begins."" Well, me too! But not in this film. Bale gives one of his weakest performances in his career. His character is static, which is why he's not needed in the film at all, and he just shouts throughout the film. Get on with it already! Let's see something else!<br/><br/>Sam Worthington, on the other hand, is pretty decent. He's sure the next up and coming actor every studio will be vying for. Other than his accent slipping out of place here and there, his performance is solid and believable. No wonder Cameron hired him for ""Avatar!"" The other great actor was Anton Yelchin as Kyle Reese. I personally wasn't sure about him beforehand, but he was actually great as Kyle. Everyone else, though, was ""Meh.""<br/><br/>ENJOYMENT: Well, as you can tell from my review so far, I am quite disappointed the way the film has turned out. Before the film was released, I was really hyped for it, from the moment Bale was cast to when the negative reviews came in. I was literally addicted to the franchise, catching up on every bit of news I could find.<br/><br/>Bale was cast, the script was rewritten by skilled people, Arnold gave his best blessing, Linda Hamilton contributed to the film, Cameron recommended Worthington to McG, etc. How could the film seriosuly be any worse? (The rating was the only thing that bothered me.) When the reviews came in, I was, like, ""Pshh... I'll judge the film myself."" When I actually saw the film, I was disappointed.<br/><br/>It failed to reach my expectations. It wasn't even better than ""T3."" And I felt it was the weakest of the series, no matter how hard I tried liking it.<br/><br/>REPLAY VALUE: Pending.<br/><br/>OTHER (MUSIC, SPFX, CINEMATOGRAPHY, ETC.): Finally! Here's something to talk about! I liked the music. Danny Elfman did a fine job, at least better than Marco Beltrami. His new theme was good, too. He retained the metallic and emotional themes Brad Fiedel left behind. The special effects are undeniably awesome also. From the complete computer generated Arnold to the amazing explosions, McG sure does know how to film action scenes and use special effects to its full potential. A lot of the credit goes to the late Stan Winston, who did fantastic work.<br/><br/>The cinematography is just as great. Despite the Bale rant, Shane Hurlbut does a nice job. There were no problems with the lighting at all, the long shots were done efficiently, and the film's bleak, post-apocalyptic look fit perfectly. The sets and designs I saw on film were spot on as well.<br/><br/>Verdict: What can I say? As both a stand-alone film and part of the franchise, this film fails at story but achieves in technicality. A near perfect example of style over substance, no? Let's just hope the fifth installment will bring back the credibility this franchise has always been looking for since 1991."

"nikpathak","5","1","3","28 June 2009"," High on action but pathetically low on content!! It surely is ""judgement day"" for terminator series !!
","Well, I am a terminator freak alright but nothing has been impressive enough since T2. The brand ""terminator"" is being eroded with sequels which do not come even light years closer to the T2 mania T3 was almost there in an effort to 'terminate' it but T4 surely did (the director deserves a bow for achieving that!!)<br/><br/>Regarding this flick, it's all action (that's at least we can expect from anything with name ""terminator"" as a prefix or suffix) but no content at all. Nobody knows why humans are fighting machines -the height of which is the resistance itself is not sure whether to go for an attack or not!! McG has totally disappointed with this one. Absolutely no story line – at the end of it nobody in the audience knew anything except that the war is going on and Terminator 5 will be released in due course well guys we don't require a star studded line up and Hollywood's best brains to tell us that much in 2 hours.. The entire 2 hours is being lived on reputation and legacy with nothing but ""past memories"" like ""I'll be back"" ... etc...<br/><br/>Where is the story for this one? Christian Bale as John Connor has disappointed (with no fault of his – he is an excellent actor and films like batman series, The Prestige, Rescue Dawn, American Psycho prove it enough) Machines take 75% of screen time – well I can play a video game if I wanted to see machines in action!! Most surprising of all is how Bale's Connor takes a back seat to the main plot of Wright's redemption (Wright is a 'machine' spy sent by sky-net to destroy human kind. LOL  even this 'cybernetic creature' would have been a better director for content!!). This is not something one would expect from a film that touts the new Batman in its lead role... Why they must keep Kyle safe and send back when judgement day has already happened to save the future!! – Nobody knows this except the great Connor (may be Kyle is sleeping with the director to ""go back""). <br/><br/>The ""Arnie"" touch is missing (he was may be there for 40-50 seconds but could not rescue the sinking ship) you actually laugh when Bale says 'I'll be back' (hehehe – even a dead amoeba can be more convincing than that)<br/><br/>""Terminator"" is the reason why I believe in sci-fi action movies . MCG does not have any right to screw this legacy pronounce him a criminal with a 'red corner notice' and quickly terminate him <br/><br/>Action – 7/10 (you should expect this much at least from a terminator sequel with a 200 million dollar plus budget... thank god there are separate action and visual effects directors than this mule 'MCG') Content – 0/10 Average would come to 3.5/10 --- adding 1 for ""terminator"" brand so effective 4.5(can generously be rounded off to 5)"

","I've grown up watching The Terminator series... I've been a hardcore fan of the James Cameron epics. I've seen T2 at least 10-12 times... oh man, what a classic! But Terminator 3: Rise Of The Machines directed by Jonathan Mostow, which came long ago, was a disappointment. Ditto for McG's 'Terminator Salvation'. <br/><br/>The problem for me first of all is, Terminator can never be the same without Arnie... he immortalized Terminator... he's the best and minus him, Terminator will lack the fun. The second problem is the slow treatment, minus the action, the film hardly has anything that makes you go WOW! In a nutshell, 'Terminator Salvation' is an okay fare at best. <br/><br/>Performances: Bale is good as John Connor. Sam Worthington is impressive. Anton Yelchin, first featured in Star Terk and now Terminator Salvation, this boy is going places. His performance is passable. Bryce Dallas Howard looks angelic and delivers a sincere performance. Helena Bonham Carter is wasted.<br/><br/>On the whole, 'Terminator Salvation' is no where close to its earlier parts. A strictly one time watch!"

","Only one word for this. Disappointing. Maybe expectations were too high, maybe it's hard to make another T2, but then some originality would have been appreciated. Borrowing every single tried & tested method from the first two films (bullets, bazookas, molten lead, freezing... everything has been done before) does not make it a sure shot winner. Neither does the damp squib of a plot. If you haven't seen no 1 & 2 you will probably not even be impressed by John Connor, leader of the resistance, only hope for the humans, blah blah, if it was not for Christian Bale's lovely face it wouldn't have mattered even if John Connor was cut into 50 pieces & fed to mechanical hyenas. Everybody is an accessory in this movie, male lead, female lead, supporting cast, nobody matters, only thing that is good is the camera-work, special effects & the technical shizznit Hollywood is so good at. But then if technicality made good films then we'd see the Resident Evil series screened at Cannes. Verdict: Watch it if you have time to kill. Otherwise give us Christian Bale as Bruce Wayne any day, we'll pass on John Connor.<br/><br/>P.S: I almost forgot, wait for the scene where Arnie Schwarzenegger appears, it's so funny, you'll probably laugh enough to get your ticket-price's worth."

The idioms of the robot assassin entered our culture.<br/><br/>Terminator Salvation seems to believe its true parents were Matrix, I am Legend and War of the Worlds. Much has been made of Bale, and he is part of the films bastardisation.

"timewind","6","1","3","25 June 2009"," Overall review
","Yesterday was the judgment day. I went to see the movie. I want to start with 2 main sentences: 1. Why do you guys spoil such a fantastic chance(s) to do a great movie series/saga? 2. Definitely could be done very much better with the same cast and effects. <br/><br/>No story, just brief links with T1. A very nice, crappy movie about what could be as T4. <br/><br/>Directed: 4/10 Story/Written: 3/10 Cameras: 7/10 Music: 7/10 Visual effects: 7/10 Sound Effects: 6/10 Casting: 7/10 Costume design: 7/10<br/><br/>No Cameron name in full cast&crew list. This had a valuable impact on what has been done. As I mentioned story was very week. First part of the movie you don't understand what's going on at all. During McG's interview he was saying that this not a commercial movie, but I guess it was. Unfortunately 2 series have been spoiled already (3, 4). And I'm sure that next 5th movie will be a sequential crap for 3 and 4 and not back to great T2 level (actually that's what we were expecting from 4). <br/><br/>Marcus Wright - good actor choice, but. What he was doing in this movie? Easy solution for producers? as a glue for pieces of story? or just a ""heart replacement"" for Connor?<br/><br/>What was the movie about is a big question. Connor meets Kyle or what? A lot of time wasted on chasing, etc. Would be very nice to see where they got that sky-net signal decoder. Another glue for story. We see that new machines are strong, smart, cruel. Then Connor successfully sneaking into sky-net heart in SF, meeting only one t600 on his way. Then helicopter waiting so much long in the same place that much quite. And a lot of other very noticeable gaps of this kind! A lot of scenes in the dark that can not see what's really going on...<br/><br/>Once they lost their chance to have Arnold in T3. Now a very short scene with T1 Arnold. Done not good enough! Could be much better! Shooting of the film started on May 5, 2008, I have a feeling that they were hurrying up to finish the movie!<br/><br/>Nice new terminators: T600, T-bikes, etc. Good and realistic visual effects. could be done more. Very nice piece with gigantic terminator then followed by t-bike chase and ending with transporter part. Sound effects also were very realistic and good 3D. Great to bring back Guns'n'Roses track. But they should use the Terminator theme music a little more. <br/><br/>Overall 6 out of 10. Weak. Could and should be done better!"

","The first two sucked you in and didn't let go. Linda Hamilton, Micheal Biehn and Arnold created entertaining characters and you didn't want the films to end.<br/><br/>This 4th entry is mindless, uncreative, schlocky and so over the top. Here Christian Bale is thrown up against walls, beat up and even impaled and still manages to get up and even give a quick nod as he lies on a gurney with a few little wraps of gauze on his chest. Does Hollywood really think we'll buy into this?<br/><br/>This film offers nothing new at all. It's exactly what you think it is. Just watch the first two over again."
"kdude12","3","1","3","12 June 2009"," Even a director with an infantile name can make a good movie; too bad this one didn't
","The Terminator series started with a movie that was intelligent and provocative, despite the fact that it was also an action-packed romp. This latest movie is sadly devoid of any hint of that intelligence. In fact, by watching the four-minute trailer you can see pretty much the whole plot and all the best bits of the movie. A die-hard sci-fi fan won't be able to resist watching this, but I would recommend waiting for the DVD or television release. In that way you will save yourself the frustration of paying good money, you will avoid rewarding such a plodding and dim-witted producer and director, and you will allow yourself to do something else while the movie is lumbering along."

It's been given a 12A but the opening sequence includes an execution by lethal injection! The only tension is whether the character of Marcus is there to defend or kill John Conner - the rest just bowls along without focus, plot, or script, pinching from Transformers, Steve McQueen's motorbike jump in 'The Great Escape' and the smell of napalm in the morning from'Apocalypse Now' amongst others. This is a world where some resistance fighters grub around with tatty trannies,no fuel,little food, and grubby clothing, while the organised resistance fights with head mikes, Apache helicopters, and A10 aircraft, and its pilots wear imitation Gucci! By the way, Skynet Airways does not fly from San Francisco to Bakersfield (where the resistance airforce carries on quite undisturbed), and Marcus' stolen dirty overcoat is flameproof, unlike Arnie's synthetic skin!While the plot where every machine is programmed to kill Conner and Reese on sight, sees the latter locked up in a cell by robots so that he can be rescued by his son! Of course, it's not the machines' fault, it's a rogue human dying of cancer who sets up Judgment Day! Come back Arnie and James Cameron - all is forgiven. The TV series disappeared up its own backside, and this will just trundle along (there are fourteen years still to go before Arnie kills John Conner! While the real disappointment for female fans is the fact that Kate Brewster just moons about as a pregnant earth mother ( presumably Claire Danes took one look at the script and said no with the second word being off!). Good for teenage boys to look and be anaesthetised by violence - you can be thrown around by robots and still walk away with just a scratch!!

","The plot is so poorly thought out it is untrue. Suspending disbelief is one thing, but ignoring all plausibility is another matter.<br/><br/>The main plot of Marcus is pretty lame, but it would be acceptable if it was well played out. All the little things in the film are wrong, amazingly a super intelligent wargames AI is unable to triangulate a radio signal, the dialogue between characters is extremely limited, there is no character development and it gives no indication of any emotional connection with each other, the humans are using technology solutions against a vastly superior technological force, Skynet exhibits an emotional response about a small pointless video screen being destroyed...Again I could still extend my suspension of disbelief past all the little problems if the major elements were OK.<br/><br/>Unfortunately everything about this screams poor writing. The plot is wafer thin and yet the director saw fit to have Skynet explain the plot of the film just before the finale! If you need the villain to explain the plot then you haven't done a good enough job writing the plot in the first place!<br/><br/>Skynet, the ultimate strategy computer, decided that 2 terminators is adequate defence against hundreds of humans?? Skynet is also unable to muster any reinforcements when the aforementioned amazing plan of 2 terminators vs 100+ humans starts to fail.<br/><br/>The ""trap"" Skynet lays is pathetically obvious that I would be surprised if a 3 year old fell for, and even if you did fall for it why would your submarine be blasting out a signal when Skynet appears to be completely inaccessible from the water? I cant imagine that the leaders of the resistance have the cognitive capacity to actually run a submarine!<br/><br/>Again Hollywood fails with its car chase...amazingly the chase scene is even less plausible than Wanted's Dodge Viper vs Delivery van....this time it is super agile motor bikes verses a pickup truck! For some reason it takes ages for these bikes to catch the pickup truck...even relatively slow bikes can hit 60mph in 6 seconds...a relatively sprightly winch laden pickup truck could maybe be looking at 15 seconds...the pickup truck is even travelling in a straight line and hitting obstacles.<br/><br/>And then there's the fight scenes...Terminator 1 and 2 made sense, when Arnie attacked to get some clothes what did he do...he punch straight through the guys stomach... in Terminator 4 for some reason he decides WWE wrestling is the best form of attack. If a super strong robot attacks he will either try to punch clean through the character or crush him, I was waiting for the Terminator to clothesline John Connor it was that silly!<br/><br/>They really should have looked at the script and had a complete re- write!<br/><br/>Basically I have given 4 stars because the robots are cool, explosions are cool but lets face it if it wasn't a terminator film it would be straight to DVD..."

It was top notch from a visual and aural standpoint, apart from the shaky cam during the action, which gets a bit much.<br/><br/>The story was OK... but there was a bunch of problems with it. For one, Skynet was completely, and utterly retarded. Why wouldn't it kill Kyle Reese straight away? And how would it even know he's John Connor's father, unless it had access to the police and hospital videos from T1 and T2? Why was Skynet kidnapping people when it was clearly established in T1 and T2 that its only goal was to destroy humanity? And why did Skynet need big screen monitors? And keyboards? It's a farking computer program! And then why did Skynet have to give a Bond villain speech using Helena Bonham Carter's face? I'm usually OK with retarded stuff in movies. In general I can forgive it, but when it comes from a pedigree like Terminator... I mean, come on. The writing was pretty weak as a whole, but at least there were a bunch of little nods to the previous films that I enjoyed.<br/><br/>Christian Bale seemed to have phoned in his performance. Sam Worthington was pretty good - looks like Hollywood has a new action hero. Go Australia! ;) Anton Yetchin was pretty decent as a young Kyle Reese... BUT - that rapper guy sucked. Moon Bloodgood sucked. The little afro kid sucked. All three characters played by these people were completely and utterly pointless and out of place. Cut them all out and you instantly have a better film. Also, the biggest problem with the casting was Bryce Dallas Howard. Too young, too weak, too pretty and make up laden. She's supposed to be 16 years older than Claire Danes was in 2003, and did not look it at all. She's too young and it made no sense. Overall, the acting was pretty hammy and it shows that McG does not have the ability to get good performances out of his actors. Also, Michael Ironside is cool. Too bad he got such a small role.<br/><br/>Also, although I DID like the look of the post-apocalyptic world... I thought they should have kept it more in line with the look of the future war in the first 2 movies. The sky darkened by nuclear ash, more vicious, relentless Terminators... People just trying to survive. Even T3 got that right when they briefly showed the future war there.<br/><br/>T3 was just a jokey, self-parodying rehash for the most part... BUT... the best parts of T3 were better than the best parts of T4. That said... I did enjoy T4... at least for the action, design, sound and the tiny consistent things they got right. From that standpoint, it was good."

","What made T2:Judgement Day was James Cameron giving you characters (including the cyborg) you cared about, however silly it was. In the original, you were oulling for Reese and Sarah Connor. T3: Rise of the machines knew what it was and Arnold played it for what it was worth, another enjoyable action film. Terminator Salvation is a big budget, CGI driven dark empty shell of a movie. It delivers on action, yes. The bleak atmosphere, the wasteland, the lack of hope, the lack of characters lends itself no color, no substance. We had Transformers 2 years ago and a sequel this year. The effects and action sequences were dazzling in that film. We have seen large robotic things shoot at people before. Even on this level, the film fails to wow you. Christian Bale does his best Steven Seagal with as wooden a John Connor your can get. And while the filmmakers try to give you substance with Sam Worthington, somewhere in the back of your mind you know how the story plays out and you can care less about the outcome of the film. Apart from the action sequence midway through the film for approx. 10 minutes, this film is boring. By the end, you are grateful the credits are rolling. This could have been great with Arnold (once out of office) donning the Ray-Ban's one last time with a creative script. People would have paid to see that. This film is forgettable at best. A major disappointment."

","My brother and I are huge Terminator fans. When I saw the trailer for this, I thought I have got to see it.My brother and I just went to the movies to see it last night. To be honest I was quite disappointed.<br/><br/>It begins with bucket loads of action with no explanation of what's going on. This is rated 12A in the movies. I really don't think a young child is going understand the story of The Terminator franchise if they haven't seen the first 2 movies, which were awesome. The 3rd wasn't so good. Terminator is really aimed at the older audience.<br/><br/>I was impressed with the opening titles, I thought they were very good.<br/><br/>Christian Bale I thought did well as John Connor but the rest of the cast was average. The special effects a lot of the times went way over the top, I was thinking OK calm down with the effects.<br/><br/>The story wasn't brilliant. With Marcus Wright, it is completely obvious that he is a machine because he signed a contract that has the word SKYNET on it. I can't believe that was a twist<br/><br/>The direction and filming was good, but I wish Cameran did it again. I think this one was more aimed at kids not actual Terminator fans.<br/><br/>There were a few goods bits which were good, but they don't really last long. There were quite a lot of ridiculous stunts they you can not survive through, for example Connor is on a helicopter on top of choppy, stormy seas possibly one hundred feet up. He dives off in the sea to get to a sub which is underwater and then cuts to when he's in the sub. Seriously, why did they do that? <br/><br/>Overall it was OK, but not really Terminator. It was more like an action that doesn't use any brain cells with the word Terminator in it. Termintor is an action film with an awesome story and uses a lot of brain cells.<br/><br/>You can go and see by all means. But I would rather wait till the DVD is out to rent. I think a lot of Terminator fans would be more outraged than I was."

","OK T1 Good, T2 Brilliant, T3 Not bad, T4 Nose diving like the HK in it. Right i'm a massive fan of The Terminator, Loved the Sarah Conner Chronicles. The main problem with this film is the director, i swear at some points in it a 4yr was holding that camera. Don't get me wrong, if you wanna watch an action film then rent it on DVD when it comes out. If you wanna watch a Terminator film then watch any of the others.<br/><br/>Script was bad, made Christian Bale look bad and thats quite hard to do. No one in this first stole it for me. Liked the idea of filling in some gaps even if it was some stuff that we didn't care about, eg where Connor got his scar from. The rumor of Arnie being was kinda true. Putting his face on a T800 was a good idea, but it looks really bad. Scorpion King bad. And what is with the chin on the Terminator, it's huge. At least with T3 the Terminators stayed the same as the originals. SFX of T2 still kicks ass.<br/><br/>I think the only person who stood out was Sam Worthington, Mainly coz he got lucky and didn't have to say much. Liked how he behaves like a Terminator from the start even thuo you already know he's one.<br/><br/>Overall the idea was good. We really need James Cameron back. This film could have been soo much better. Instead it's a action film with a franchise badge stuck on it. I know i've slated this film, but this if from a Terminator fan point of view. I really wanted this film to be great."

","I originally wasn't going to comment on this movie, but after seeing some of the higher ratings contained here, I feel that I have to. Saying that this is a good movie if you disregard ""the reality"" ala the previous movies in the franchise, is like saying AIDS would be amazing if it didn't kill you, hurt at all, and everybody won money afterwards. That is not ""the reality"" of the case, neither is it the reality for the movie, TS, whose sole purpose is to exist as just another example of the movie industry shitting all over a good franchise in the hope of making fast bucks. <br/><br/>This 'visual feast' of a movie left me with a crude case of indigestion, as I found myself shovelling through thick layers of cgi looking for traces of believable acting, a good plot and scenes with any real bite. Instead I was greeted with a dud missile, a shaky cam vision of a future that was complete with jocular references to previous titles, wannabe heroism, and a story which is thin, unfilling and exists only as a series of devices in order to lead to more; sweet, sweet cgi etc. etc. <br/><br/>Basically most cinema goers will know what they're in for (and can get the same from the new 'Transformers 2' a few weeks down the road). Is it a rolla' costa ride? Sure. Will you enjoy it? Maybe. Is it a movie that will bring you back once the nostalgia of a cinema viewing has gone? Negative.<br/><br/>Marketable; but in short, forgettable."

In fact, during the film my friend nodded in agreement when I remarked that it almost seemed like someone had cut all of the drama and dialogue from the film so the viewer could watch a montage of over the top action scenes.<br/><br/>It's not the fault of any actor/actress. The performances are good...but there's not much in the way of a story to get into.<br/><br/>McG has made a film that looks good....but that's it. The movie is certainly watchable, but it's easily forgettable. It's not in the same league as T1 or T2. Given the budget and cast, this movie should've been much more.

Christian Bale, a terminator movie, it had all the ingredients for success..<br/><br/>But, after the credits rolled, i walked out of the cinema feeling somewhat, deflated. the friend i was with also felt the same way.<br/><br/>in a way, its hard to put down exactly what was wrong with the movie. the cinematography, CGI was all okay. the acting was also okay.<br/><br/>i think it was generally that the script was a bit poor, the story was also kinda draggy. also, i was expecting a lot more men v terminator epic kind of battles, but apart from a couple of fight scenes, a lot of them were repetitions of previous terminator movies.<br/><br/>as my friend said, all in all, it was very predictable.<br/><br/>the other nagging thing that i had, was the huge number of plot holes in the movie which just didn't ring true.<br/><br/>i mean, they are quite a few years into the way, and they are still able to field aircraft and helicopters (which crash or get blown up regularly)? whats up with that.<br/><br/>and how can skynet allow them to just operate airbases etc like that.<br/><br/>the weapons (and their effectiveness) in this show also don't really make much sense. they seem to be much more effective here with standard carbines, than in the previous terminators... that just didn't make any sense to me.<br/><br/>so apparently we are led to believe, that kyle reese is to be termninated. but, when he is captured, instead of just killing him they put him in lock up? again.. just didn't make any sense with me.<br/><br/>and oh, john connor, can infiltrate an entire skynet base, just by himself, and with an eye taken from a terminator? that was just ridiculous.<br/><br/>finally, the way that they blow up the aircraft on the bridge.. that was also nonsensical and defied the laws of gravity.. i think the director was looking at too many transporter movies when he planned that scene.<br/><br/>all in all, very very disappointed."

","I sat in the theater and kept wondering when I was going to feel moved by anything in it. It never happened. Better than terminator 3, but no where near T2. Where is sky-net? I mean the story Arnold tells in T2 is interesting about the war, and gets into the soul of sky-net. In this film you feel as if Skynet is content to sit in San Francisco and just slowly make machines. Why aren't they attacking? The ending was rather cheesy, with a helicopter easily landing in Sky-nets front yard without so much as a T-600 showing up to say ""Hi."" T2 was the masterpiece, and say what you want, but Arnold and Edward Furlong made that movie awesome. This was totally lacking in the emotion department."
"Markbruinekreeft","3","1","3","29 May 2009"," Succeeds in carefully removing everything that ever made this franchise worth the bother.
","Well, I may not be a dedicated Terminator fan-boy, but I know how I like my unstoppable kill-bots from the future...and this new diet Terminator with extra cheese just doesn't do it for me, sorry. <br/><br/>Apart from most of the action sequences and the new robot designs, just about everything about this film simply didn't work. <br/><br/>The acting was pretty bad, although that may simply be because the dialog and characters were all so badly written. Either way; most characters in this film were either dull, annoying, or kept alternating between the two. In fact, one quarter into the movie, I realized that I'd started to root for the machines. Yes, I was silently cheering on props and CGI robots. That's how unappealing and boring I thought the human characters were.<br/><br/>The plot isn't much to look at either. This film has a running time of about 115 minutes. It doesn't have nearly enough plot to stay interesting that whole time. Even the fairly well executed action scenes that burst onto the screen every now and then can't prevent the flick from becoming just a bit dull halfway through. This is probably mostly because the meager story is chock full of unnecessary filler scenes and is awfully convoluted for a very basic script that gets only very little real storytelling done in nearly two hours. <br/><br/>The reason why I liked the first two Terminator films was that they weren't only well written and slick action thrillers. They actually contained some real character development, and even some philosophical and ethical themes. Nothing of the sort in this film, however. There's a few vague lines about fate. There's some obligatory jabbering about retaining one's humanity in a war against soulless machines. And that's about it in the philosophy department for this flick. <br/><br/>So in short; nothing of real interest in this entire film, not for casual movie goers or for Terminator fans. There are no interesting characters, no really significant revelations about the series' mythos, nothing. The only reason why I think you would want to watch this film is for the okay action sequences. But the obvious drawback of that is that you're going to have to sit through all the boring, dumb slop in between them."
"Jay_Exiomo","6","1","3","27 May 2009"," Cold, calculated machination
","Like a mean killing machine, ""Terminator Salvation"" racks up the action scenes with boisterous gusto, but when tasked to fill in the obligatory narrative, McG's post-apocalyptic saga of John Connor delivers as much heart as a hunk of clunking metal. The third sequel to James Cameron's technophobic sci-fi series goes washed in desaturated tones and gets cheerlessly monotonous as it finds itself full-speeding to 2018, further stretching the ontological paradox between Connor and his father Kyle Reese without any attempt to inject a shred of innovation to John Brancato and Michael Ferris' script.<br/><br/>Fourteen years after the sinister Skynet has eradicated much of humanity in 2004, John (a grim scowling Christian Bale), now leading a group of survivors in their battle against man-killing machines, is bent on using a newly-discovered radio frequency that could shut down Skynet's San Francisco base, while hard-pressed to find Kyle (Anton Yelchin), the member of the resistance who will one day travel back in time to impregnate John's mother, Sarah Connor. Joining them is Marcus Wright (dull Sam Worthington), a convict set to die by lethal injection in 2003 but mysteriously reemerges in 2018 amidst the Armageddon.<br/><br/>Certainly absorbed by Cameron's relentlessly action-packed mythology, McG garishly sprinkles the film with nods to its forbears and achieves it with wildly mixed results -- from Bale's painfully awkward ""I'll be back"" to Yelchin's somewhat amusing ""Come with me if you want to live"" -- that it isn't much of a homage as it is a mere pastiche of catchphrases and trademarks flimsily bound by slam bang action sequences. And stripped of the kind of humor that defined ""The Terminator,"" ""T2,"" and to a lesser extent, ""T3,"" ""Terminator Salvation"" essays in its place a supposed human drama defined by hollow ciphers and superficial drama. The whiz-bang extravaganza and imposing setpieces keep McG's venture into the mix from being a total bust, but just like its array of assembly-line machines, once it pauses from the action and delves into emotions, one can't help but have a feeling of cold, calculated machination."
"Syntax_Terror","5","1","3","22 May 2009"," Terminator: Satisfactory
","Salvation was a satisfactory addition to the Terminator series... yup, you heard it: Satisfactory. We really don't see anything to new or exciting in this sequel. I really feel that Christian Bale fell short of his usual acting prowess that is easily seen in his other films while the real star, Sam Worthington, outshines in his role. not to be left out is Anton Yelchin, who performs Kyle Reese to a tee.<br/><br/>The real letdown is the lack of the true battle and battlefield that we've only got a glimpse of in the previous installments. The resistance survivors seem clueless and destined for picking off from the machines as they bunker down ABOVE ground for easy targeting.<br/><br/>When it all comes down to it, the direction isn't the problem. McG surely does his best and goes the extra mile to make the movie look and sound as good as it does, but the script seems a weekend splurge between two drunken Hollywood hopefuls that are just out to get a paycheck.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong though, I've spent money on worse and I'm not regretting putting down the dough to see this on the big screen, but I definitely won't go back for a second helping."
"Dragonsouls","6","1","3","21 May 2009"," A confused film at times
","I don't know how I'm going to review this film. I should compare it to the others, but I would never compare this film to the three that preceded it. But let me give a brief summary on the first 3 before I review Terminator Salvation.<br/><br/>The first Terminator film was the ultimate mystery chase film. The robot was a mystery, who revealed his true self little by little as his flesh began melting off during the course of the film. The audience just didn't know what to expect until the great finale.<br/><br/>The 2nd Terminator film was as good as action movies get. Real stunts, epic production, and intelligent ideology to compliment the fantastic action and character development. T2 will always stand alone as the best.<br/><br/>The 3rd film was lacking something, but it was very well written and acted. Arnold played the role very well in this film. It was solid, full of great action, even though it didn't have the emotions of T2.<br/><br/>But as for T4 (Salvation)....I'm just at a loss for words. I loved some things, and hated some. First and foremost, the things I liked about it- Atmosphere. Loads of it. Great production for this film, even better than T2. The film was reminding of me some video games I've played such as the Half Life games, and Fallout games. There were some scenes that McG filmed very well, reminding me of Children of Men at times. The sense of chaos was felt in some scenes, and mystery, not knowing if the characters would survive the assault of various machines that could be very sneaky at times, causing me to jump here and there.<br/><br/>Now, the things I hated. Quite simply; the PG-13 rating. The movie started out as a grim tale of survival. And the action was way too unreal. It became too far fetched and took away from the realism.<br/><br/>John Conner. He was a complete waste. Forget Christian Bale's boring performance, it was the way the character was written that sucked. Poor Bale, such a fine actor, stuck in the shoes of a poorly written character. The guy yelled the entire film, whether trying to convince military characters to change their plans, or even in plain conversations, always yelling. And the leadership we all heard about was not evident at all. The guy was just trying to survive like the rest of humanity, there was no leadership besides his ranting on his daily radio show which was as motivating as a speech given by Mayor Bloomberg.<br/><br/>Arnold's cameo. The only time the audience cheered in the theater. For all 10 seconds of it! Thats about it.<br/><br/>The story in general. I'm a Battlestar Galactica fan and to me, this story presented in this film was for kindergarten kids compared to the depth of a series like BSG which has similar messages as Terminator films.<br/><br/>The ending. Not going to spoil anything, but I'm just going to say that it reminded me of the first Terminator, except...the first film scared the hell out of me! 6/10 . Above average production, but the rating hurts it. This franchise belongs in the R category, and if it wasn't for the latest Star Trek film, I'd probably have no more faith in Hollywood anymore."
"Med-Jasta","1","1","4","19 March 2020"," Just stupid...
","Why Christian Bale?! Why?!<br/><br/>The idea of being in the future was great. But instead of following through they tried too hard to make it tie into the old movies.

He can't even keep an American accent for one scene.<br/><br/>This movie was a waste of time, money, energy, resources even the exhaust of the cars and explosions."

"Leofwine_draca","6","1","4","11 November 2016"," Nice change of pace for the series, although this is nothing more than a fun popcorn flick
","Big, bold, brash and flashy. Those are four words you could use to describe this, the fourth film in the TERMINATOR saga, which has arrived in cinemas with a ton of publicity surrounding it. First off, the internet was abuzz when surfers discovered that McG, the director responsible for the execrable CHARLIE'S ANGELS films, had been hired, and then there was all that furore surrounding the leaked audio clip of Christian Bale ranting at some poor technician. In the end, the question is simple: is this a worthy addition to the series? The answer is yes and no. No, because no film in existence will ever be able to reach the heights of the Cameron-directed first two movies in the series, and yes, because this is nearly as effective a popcorn flick as TERMINATOR 3. Both the latter films are similar in that they're straightforward blow-em-up action epics full of effects and stunt work structured around a slim storyline.<br/><br/>Where TERMINATOR SALVATION has the edge over its predecessor purely because the plot isn't just a re-run of the last film's; instead, this is a movie that takes place in a post-apocalyptic future where the world has been decimated by nuclear war. It's not the kind of dark and gritty future seen in the Cameron films, but instead a glossy, effect-filled landscape in which huge robots duke it out with human survivors. It's quite similar to the TRANSFORMERS films in that respect, but the script is far more intelligent – and the cast far better at their jobs.<br/><br/>Christian Bale is one of my favourite actors and he's fine here as John Connor, but his character really takes a back seat. Just as Bale faded into the background when paired with Heath Ledger in THE DARK KNIGHT, here he steps back to allow Aussie newcomer Sam Worthington his fair share of the spotlight. Worthington, in an emotional, multi-layered turn as a death row convict hiding a dark secret that he himself doesn't even realise is very good and has the potential to go far in Hollywood. Of the supporting acts, Moon Bloodgood excels as a tough femme fatale, newcomer Anton Yelchin is excellent as the young and determined Kyle Reese, and Michael Ironside lends much-needed gravitas as a seasoned rebel leader. Only Bryce Dallas Howard and Helena Bonham Carter suffer in what are extraneous roles.<br/><br/>Of course, those looking for substance behind the action won't find much, because TERMINATOR SALVATION is in essence a chase thriller, nothing more, nothing less. It's a string of blistering action set-pieces full of robots blowing people up and people blowing robots up. The CGI effects are for the most part very good indeed, especially the hulking robo-skeletons who blow away the rusty stop-motion of the original 1984 movie, although some of the backgrounds are very obviously non-existent. The scene with the massive people-collecting robot alone is better than the whole of that dratted TRANSFORMERS movie, while a road chase with robo-motorbikes is a fun nod to MAD MAX 2. Speaking of nods, there's a nice line in references to the previous movies, with Linda Hamilton returning for uncredited voice-over work and even Schwarzenegger himself making an appearance, albeit digitally rather than in person. I'm a big fan of action films and TERMINATOR SALVATION ticks all the boxes. I look forward to re-watching it one day to see whether it holds up to repeat scrutiny, but in the main this is an effective, crowd-pleasing popcorn flick that breathes new life into what was previously a dead franchise."

","Greetings from Lithuania.<br/><br/>""Terminator Salvation"" (2009) is a great entertainment. It not equal to first two movies by far, but it is better then 3rd and surely by many moons better then ""Genisys"". <br/><br/>That said ""Terminator Salvation"" delivers goods in terms of entertainment and it does a great job in being a ""Terminator"" movie set in days after Judgement Day. The world is bleak, set design is very good especially in out-door scenes. Special effects are great (i love the bicycles assault scene especially were one spins over the screen - great scene). Robots are crude and not sharply done by purpose, this is early period of after Judgment Day and Skynet doesn't evolved to create sharp models - they are created for purpose, not fore eye candy. Yet. <br/><br/>The only complain about this movie in my opinion was the very end of this movie (after all battles scenes at the camp). Last scenes - they aren't strong and don't leave lasting impressions, but they are not bad by any means. Christian Bale does a descent job, but Sam Worthington gives a superb performance, he is the soul of this movie. McG direction is also solid, he shows us this bleak world. The references to first two movies are great, with lines and characters and etc. <br/><br/>Overall, i always highly enjoyed ""Terminator Salvation"". It is not as good as first two movies, but it shows us this universe in new fashion. I would love to see sequence for this movie MUCH more then a dreadful, not involving and just simply boring ""Genisys"" - ""Terminator Salvation"" delivers what it promises."
"caseynicholson","5","1","4","1 September 2015"," Hard to Get Into
","After watching the first three films in the series, I found ""Terminator: Salvation"" hard to get into. It wasn't a bad movie, really. But it's set in the post-apocalyptic future past Judgment Day, and its treatment of the sci-fi element is so dissimilar to the previous three films that it just made for a very different vibe overall.<br/><br/>Pro's: the casting for Kyle Reese was pretty good, as the guy's voice sounded similar to the actor from the first film. The plot is fair--not terrible, although the entire point of Sam Worthington's character is still a bit strange to me, aside from just being a clever device to add to a somewhat lackluster story.<br/><br/>Con's: John Conner's character is set up as a relative nobody as opposed to the leader of the resistance. Granted, the year is 2018 whereas Conner sends Reese back in time for the first movie in the year 2029, so they were going for a back story to Conner's ascension. Still, he doesn't come across as the strong leader that he's been trained to be. And, as I said above, the whole plot of the movie is just only fair. There's nothing here that makes me feel passionate about the franchise in the way that its predecessors did.<br/><br/>I give it 5/10 stars."
"danielloe","5","1","4","1 July 2015"," A weak installment in a great franchise
","*WARNING MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS* Terminator Salvation has a pretty bad reputation, but I'm a Terminator fan, so I absolutely had to watch it. Well... it's not all bad. I am not against shaking up the formula; eliminating the chase format the first three had all had was a bold move. That's not to say it was necessarily a bad choice, it could've worked, it just... didn't. I did like the decision to show us some of the war with the machines, but unfortunately the war we are shown here is like five years after the start. Seeing John Connor organize a resistance would've been a lot of fun, but instead we just get some generic war stories that involve John Connor (y'know, the leader of the resistance) having to commit mutiny to save his father and subordinate, Kyle Reese. This movie has absolutely none of the fun of the originals, I know Terminator 3 gets heat for tossing in too much comic relief, but at least it didn't take the whole thing so dead seriously. There's no humor to liven up the proceedings, and what's worse, there's no heart or soul to this movie. The whole thing is just so bleak and depressing, and the washed out color scheme only adds to the effect. Well, what about the cast? I was really excited to see Christian Bale as John Connor, but his talents felt really wasted here. He had little more to do than talk in a deep voice and brood. And then finally at the end he got to actually do something, but even then it was all just soulless action, there was no character to it. Who would've though the role of John Connor would be so thankless. Bryce Dallas Howard plays his wife Kate Connor, and she's perhaps the most like able character. I don't know why, she just seems to have so much more soul than the others, because she's never just demoted to blasting Terminators with machine guns. She gets to support John throughout his struggles, and the actress does it well. Of course, we can't forget to mention Sam Worthington's nearly emotionless performance. Yes, he's a Terminator, and he plays the part of an emotionless machine perfectly, but not in a good way. I didn't care about this character, or his totally replaceable girl friend, so the main story of the movie was unrelateable to me. The sub plot with John and Kyle wasn't too bad, I had some interest in that, but the entire Sam Worthington arc was just boring to me. But to be brutally honest, the John Connor story line wasn't even all that good. For one thing, having John not actually be the resistance's leader is pretty lame, and also the entire operation to destroy the machines's stronghold just feels so by the numbers. It's just like someone will say, 'hey, we need to do this!' and then they do it. Next scene! There is almost no time for any character development or any passion to be put into this movie. Well, surely a Terminator movie can at least have some good action right? Let me just say that if you thought Arnie on the crane in Terminator 3 was over the top, you won't last five minutes in this movie. The final battle where John fights the Arnold Terminator was good, but it just kept going on and on and on... Until I just got bored. In a fight involving Christian Bale as John Connor and a CGi recreation of Arnold Schwarzenneger as a Terminator, I got bored. That is actually impressive. I'm sorry to hate on this movie so much, I wanted to like it, but I just couldn't get invested in this movie whatsoever."
"craig-hopton","7","1","4","13 June 2014"," A good effort but where is Arnold Schwarnegger?
","I knew from the outset that Salvation wasn't going to be as good as the first two Terminator movies, purely because Terminator is all about Arnold Scharwenegger and this movie didn't feature him. So I was half expecting Salvation to be a bit of a flop.<br/><br/>I have to admit that it exceeded my expectations. It certainly isn't at the level of the originals, but Christian Bale made this movie work with a great turn as John Conner, and the ""machines"" made up an excellent supporting cast. The inclusion of a half-human half-robot character played by Sam Worthington worked surprisingly well too, and there were decent performances from Moon Bloodgood, Helena Bonham Carter and Anton Yelchin.<br/><br/>Another thing that helped is how closely the writers stuck to the original stories and mythology of the original movies. Terminator Salvation fleshes out things from Terminator 1 and 2 like the relationship between Kyle Rees and John Connor, the development of the Terminator models, and how Sarah Connor recorded advice for John on a Dictaphone.<br/><br/>A good effort. Now let's hope from the next one they bring Schwarzenegger back properly!"
"mrrockey","4","1","4","24 March 2014"," Just Like a Machine, Technically Well Made, but Heartless
","I remember watching Terminator Salvation right when it came out with the film leaving me very cold and empty after watching it. I didn't hate it, didn't love it, it just left me cold. After revisiting this film a few days ago, things haven't changed.<br/><br/>Plot: In 2003, death row inmate Marcus Wright signs his body over to Cyberdyne Systems for medical research after execution. A year later, Skynet becomes self-aware and destroys much of humanity. 14 years later, John Connor discovers human prisoners and schematics for a new type of Terminator yet to be known to him. Meanwhile, Marcus suddenly wakes up and finds himself lost with no idea what happened to him but meets a young Kyle Reese and a mute little girl, Star. After hearing a radio broadcast from John, they go together to try to find him but Kyle and Star end up getting captured by Skynet, so Marcus ends up going instead with a resistance fighter by the name of Blair. But when they get there, Marcus accidentally steps on a mine and gets smoked but survives due to having robot parts inside him, he didn't know he had before.<br/><br/>The first big problem with Terminator Salvation is the story. It seems like the writers have no idea how to progress John's character, or expand the mythology of the Terminator universe. John Connor in this movie basically has NO development whatsoever. All he does is deliver exposition about the plot and occasionally get into an action scene. He basically has no place in this movie's script whatsoever other than that he's John Connor, so the audience expects to see him. The plot itself also feels like filler, without much of a point to the overall outcome of the series. It's like the writers have no idea what to do after T3 so they just said ""Eh, who cares, let's just write a story that has little to no consequence so we can continue to write more of these and make a bajillion dollars."" The best example of this is the 30 minutes of the film where they discover a radio signal that can shut down Skynet's machines but midway through the film, they... never bring it up again. If you want to follow the mythology of the Terminator series, missing this film wouldn't be that big of a deal.<br/><br/>The characters and the actors playing them in this movie are a mixed bag. Christian Bale just plays John Connor as a generic action hero, while speaking in his trademark Batman voice. He doesn't have much personality beyond that, he's just really bland. The only moment where he gets to shine is when he delivers a speech at the end. Marcus is supposed to be the emotional center of the film as he's the character who goes through the biggest arc but the problem is, Marcus is really unlikable. I'm not sure should I blame the script for this, or Sam Worthington's performance but either way, Marcus just came across as a huge douche the way he constantly shouts at people around him for no good reason and generally acting like a prick. I actually wanted to see Arnold rip his heart out, THAT'S how unlikable he was. Moon Bloodgood did a fine job as Blair Williams, even if she looked a little too clean and model-ish to be a soldier. But the best character has to be the young Kyle Reese, played by Anton Yelchin. I really BELIEVED this guy to be the younger version of the hero of the first film, Yelchin did a spectacular job mimicking Biehn's mannerisms but also playing his character differently enough to convince us that he's a younger version.<br/><br/>The tone of the movie is another problem. While I like how much more SERIOUS this film felt when compared to T3, which felt too jokey and almost like a PARODY of Terminator at some points, they also go way too far with it and end up creating a really dull film. No matter what kind of movie you're making, you need moments of humor and emotion in your film to make it feel real but this film just had this constant moody tone to it that made it feel as inhuman as the robots in the film. There's practically never a moment for you to take back and laugh a little and there's not a whole lot of human emotion felt in this film. Compare that to the first two films which, were action-packed movies, but also took time to have some levity and human emotion with scenes like the Terminator learning to smile in T2, or Kyle revealing to Sarah that he came back not because he was ordered, but because of love. Scenes like this make the action more exciting as the story feels real and it connects with the audience on an emotional level as well so when the big car chases DO come in, the audience is genuinely invested as opposed to just ""Explosions! Awesome!""<br/><br/>If there's anything redeeming about the film, it'd be the technicals. The cinematography has a very gritty, greyish look to it that helps sell the despair that the characters are feeling and the special effects are surprisingly convincing. They made good use of both CGI and animatronics for all the different Terminators and the way they blend together is very smooth and seamless. The action feels appropriately gritty and brutal while not showing a whole lot of blood. And props to McG for not using shaky-cam like so many rubbish action directors working today.<br/><br/>Overall, Terminator Salvation just seems confused. The writers seem to have no idea how to continue the story so they just end up creating a filler story. It's a good film on a technical level but it lacks heart. If you just want an action movie, you'll get it. But if want you something more, then keep on looking. 4/10"

","It is understandable why so many films are made with the lucrative 12A/PG 13 certificates in mind, however why on Earth write a script with 12A/PG-13 limitations, when the movie prequels already have high rated certificates! It makes sense to raise the certification from movie to movie as the core audience grows up, and it makes sense to keep the certification the same to capture a younger audience who have the option of seeing early installment on DVD, but it make absolutely no sense to lower the certification every single installment of a franchise! In the case of the Terminator, kids will have to watch the saga backwards as they age, and will have no interest in T-5 the PG, or T-6 the U! What the studio bosses realized was that adults who had dreamed of seeing James Cameron's depiction of the future for decades were going to disappointed with a PG-13 future, and since kids were too young to have legally seen the other films, they were going to have no idea about the various paradoxes so integral to the plot of the terminator universe(e.g. that Kyle Reese by traveling back in time actually fathers Jon Conner, and by the terminator traveling back in time actually leads to the existence of Sky-net), so the makers must have thought there is no way to explain and tie in the plot complexities from all the prequels, into the script in a way that young children will understand. So they try tried to simplify it, I imagine this was the original premise: Evil machines have taken over the world. It is the future. The Machines have set out to ambush Jon Conner leader of humanity, they have kidnapped his father, and sent word of his capture. The machines not wanting Conner to suspect ambush have sent a cyborg, named Marcus to infiltrate the group and relay the news. Marcus appears completely human and believes himself to be so, having had memories implanted of an actual Marcus who lived before the War. Once Marcus realizes himself to be a machine, he goes against his programming and helps with the rescue of Jon's father.<br/><br/>It doesn't sound like too bad a premise, it's fairly straight forward for kids to follow, and poses some interesting questions about humanity, i.e. Are we all product of our memories? However the problem is that it makes absolutely no sense in the overall terminator universe, and presents a massive plot hole. Sky-net does not know that Kyle Reese is Jon Conner's father!!! If it did, rather than set an ambush it would just kill Kyle Reese, and forgo the whole time machine building thing!!! This made the film unwatchable for me. I could forgive that they redesigned the terminators as transformers to appeal to the kids, removed all the violence, blood, and swearing to obtain a PG-13 cert, crow-barred in a love interest story to appeal to the girls, even that the future is no longer populated by the dirty, scarred, and malnourished, but by the immaculately clean, glamorous, athletic, perfect teethed. However by Sky-net renting T-1 and discovering that Kyle Reese is Jon's biological father the whole plot of the first terminator movie becomes worthless! This is unforgivable! 1 Star!!!"
"drpizzi2501","4","1","4","3 January 2013"," Just another boring action film...
","Hi there: <br/><br/>I just saw the movie and I felt so sad about where the terminator saga went that wanted to review it. Getting to it I gave the other reviews a quick read and was surprise to find so much argumentation about military strategy or Skynet's variety of terminators to wipe the human race with. I have given up on the movie so much earlier than all that. And so have done the people who made the movie.<br/><br/>My review is that the movie is plain bad. A terrible script, far to shallow characters, worst dialog and poorly creative action gags that, as all action sequences based on gags and Fx's (both on-set and in post)instead of a good edition, go out of fashion at the end of the week. It has nothing new to add to filming language and cinematography. <br/><br/>The first terminator was a masterpiece of high class cinema language by Cameron, a fine movie that left a deep impression in film history. T2 was a good action megafilm with Arnold(the closest to a robot a human can get), a mean liquid metal robot, motorcycles and the guns n'roses. Who wouldn't love it? The third movie no one will care about and this was a chance to make something good out of all that money and chromakey. The final part at the Skynet headquarters is so so boring... When you resurrect a character at the beginning, you can't kill him at the climax and bring him back to life again to resolve the climax. And then they kill him AGAIN at the ending having him donating his heart twice. Hombre... Please don't make a 5th movie, just release the first two to theaters again, It'll be better.<br/><br/>d.-"
"Bruce722","7","1","4","19 September 2012"," Fits well with the franchise.
","While I didn't think this movie was as good as the first two, I thought it was way better than the 3rd film. The acting was great, the story was well told and tied into the story arc well, and the effects were incredible. It really is impressive to watch all four films over a short period of time. You really appreciate how far the technology has come. I thought they did a great job with the setting and overall feel of the environment. I also thought that the concept of Sam Worthington's character was really interesting and the ""Arnie"" cameo was pretty sweet. There were some things that I wasn't a fan of however. I thought they tried to add too many new little gizmos for Skynet. I also thought the ending seemed a bit weak and almost like an afterthought. They have paraded around the concept through the entire series of your ""fate"" not being set and yet the series is always determined on never wavering from the future laid forth in past films. While the argument can be made for that logic, it can also be made countering it. Lastly, while I thought the casting for Kyle Reese was fantastic, I thought having Bryce Dallas Howard play the role of Kate Connor was a terrible idea. Not only does she look nothing like Claire Danes but she also looks way too young. The timing just doesn't feel authentic at all. Shoot, they could've just used Claire Danes and kept the continuity completely. I doubt she was too busy since she hasn't really been doing anything major. Also, while she would still be young, at least she's a bit older than Howard is and they could've always made her look a little more aged. If you can make a robot look like the spitting image of Arnie, I don't think adding a decade or so to Claire Danes would've been too much of a challenge. Overall though, this was a very good movie and definitely fit into the series well. While they have yet to really show why John Connor is a threat in the first place or to show the resistance make even a dent in Skynet, they at least hinted towards a possible light to end the darkness with the frequency concept. I don't know if they're ever going to make a fifth film or even reboot the franchise which seems to have become the rage these days but if they do neither, at least we can more or less figure out how things unfold from here."

"Samiam3","6","1","4","28 June 2010"," Appropriately action laden and subsequently stupid (but a step up from 3)
","After four entries, I'm afraid Terminator no longer makes sense. The whole time travel thing has gotten so ridiculous that attempting to descibe it hurts my brain. In Terminator, Our hero (Kyle Reese) was sent back from the future by John Connor, to ensure that his mother lived to give birth to him. This is understandable enough, and the Terminator ended up being a fine film.<br/><br/>Now, just imagine taking something like this and making it ten times more convoluted, so much so that it interferes with the plot and degrades the movie. This is exactly what happen in Terminator Salvation. That and bad acting result in a pretty mediocre movie<br/><br/>At least it could have been worse. Terminator Salvation is more than a small step up from the almost unwatchable Terminator 3. It feels like something a bit more fresh, and less like a rehashing of previous entries (which terminator 3 was) The first half of Terminator Salvation is actually pretty good containing plenty of adrenaline without ove4r doing it, but the film doesn't get better, it gets worse. I found myself loosing interest rather quickly, in part because of the growing sense of idiocy, but more importantly, because like so many summer blockbusters, this is ultimitely a shallow enterprise, hard to care for. James Cameron invested some time is giving us characters; this film has cardboard cut outs.<br/><br/>The end result while not terrible (and sometimes very thrilling) does not do enough for me to wanna recommend it."
"hnt_dnl","2","1","4","11 May 2010"," Extremely slow, loud, tedious flick
","If TERMINATOR SALVATION (2009) is not the worst of the Terminator franchise, then I don't know what is! To call this movie ""meandering"" would be a gross understatement. What exactly was this film about? OK, there are 2 basic interconnected plot points, both of which get established early. First is that the Resistance Command (located in a submarine!) has SOMEHOW found a way to control the machines through a short-wave signal. Second is that during the interception of the signal, the Command also found out that Skynet's main targets are high-level soldier John Connor (Christian Bale) and teen-aged freedom fighter Kyle Reese (Anton Yelchin), John's father that he must send back so that he can exist and save humanity.<br/><br/>The FIRST thing I queried was WHEN AND HOW DID SKYNET FIND OUT THAT KYLE IS JOHN'S FATHER?! This was something that only Sarah Connor knew! And John only found out through the tapes she left him (how they were still playable after 34 years is another story!) and there's no way John would stupidly reveal this information...OOPS...He DID halfway through the movie, but NOT at any point before in the previous 3 films was this major factoid revealed...So, again, HOW AND WHEN DID SKYNET FIND OUT?!<br/><br/>Back to the former plot point...Other than in a scene stolen directly from TRANSFORMERS, I don't think the signal was ever used on the Skynet robots! Speaking of that ripped-off TRANSFORMERS scene, there were many such scenes like this that are obvious ripoffs from big summer movies. I'm not talking about standard formulaic tricks that virtually ALL summer action movies employ; I'm talking about DIRECT, BLATANT RIPOFFS! The main offense is that Bale, for some inexplicable reason, used his raspy, annoying Batman voice from THE DARK KNIGHT to enunciate most of John Connor's dialog! It was painful to listen to. To add to it, they had a scene late in the movie where Bale stole one of Skynet's machine-operated motorcycles, then raced down the highway towards Skynet in a moment reminiscent of his racing down the streets of ""Gotham"" in TDK. I think I even heard some of the TDK soundtrack in there somewhere. So TS blatantly ripped from two RECENT summer blockbuster movies, neither of which should even exist in the Terminator universe, and one of which was made just a freakin year before it AND starred TS's main actor! Unbelievable.<br/><br/>TS was obviously meant to be a ""serious"" movie. But it was more of just a downbeat, tiresome experience. I understand that the aftermath of a nuclear apocalypse should be downbeat. Yet everything in the movie felt like a contrivance or a convenience to suit the purposes of the movie. And the surprise revelation late in the movie was a BIG stretch, the genesis of which made no sense. It was really just a silly way to explain away everything, not some slick or brilliant twist. <br/><br/>Actually, Bale shares lead duties with Sam Worthington (who plays holocaust survivor Marcus Wright). While the more experienced Bale is borderline terrible in TS, Worthington gives a decent performance to counter Bale's monosyllabic grunting and theatrics. I found Wright's story more interesting than Connor's in this, but it had too many cliché moments and scenes to be taken seriously. Marcus' story being the primary one needs to be involving, but it is told in a linear, predictable manner with scenes of EVERY character he comes across seeing the ""good"" inside him and eventually trusting him with no real basis or provocation. <br/><br/>Other than the ho-hum dialog, there is random, uninvolving, unexciting action mainly to show off all the different styles of Terminators out there, including one that looks like a Transformer...Yikes! TS is actually more reminiscent of bleak apocalypse movies like the MAD MAX films than it is the TERMINATOR franchise as none of the colorful, nightmare-noirish, futuristic scenes we got a glimpse of in the first 3 movies is evident at all in TS. Just pale, drab-looking daylight scenes. Did they change the future that much in T2?<br/><br/>Including the stars Bale and Worthington, none of the supporting characters leave any kind of real impression, with the exception of Yelchin's good performance as Kyle Reese, the only character that rises above the material. Also, I strangely didn't find that little girl that was with Kyle all the time too annoying; usually, little kids are the death knell of many a good movie (and that includes Edward Furlong's annoying, overrated rendition of John Connor in T2!). But she was apparently mute or either just chose not to speak, so that helped! The two adult female characters Kate Brewster (Bryce Howard) and Blair (Moon Bloodgood) are there OBVIOUSLY just for eye candy! There's even a gratuitous scene where Blair goes topless to seduce Marcus which felt really unnecessary.<br/><br/>In reality, TS doesn't even feel like a Terminator movie at all, just a loud, contrived, humorless summer action movie. TS also has a lot of moments where the heroes (esp. Bale) just yell out, sometimes for no apparent reason! Interestingly, Bale in one of his interviews after TS premiered said that he wanted to do a film that stayed faithful to the Terminator franchise, which was fine, but he went on to say that T1 and T2 were basically great films (won't get many arguments there), but he essentially trashed T3 saying it was unfaithful to the franchise. Guess what, though, Bale?...Contrary to the opinion of way too many so-called Terminator fans, T3 was actually a well-written and acted, provocative, fluid, exciting action movie that WAS faithful to Terminator; and even if it was not faithful to it (I think that it was), it still is a darn entertaining watch DESPITE being labeled a Terminator movie...But the movie that you were hyping and this movie I'm reviewing, TS, is NONE of those things (Terminator flick or not) and a serious contender for worst summer movie of the decade...The irony!"
"e-1529","2","1","4","20 February 2010"," Ewwww
","There are about 3 minutes in terminator 2 'the judgement day' at the beginning of the movie that show the battle against the machines. Probably about 5 minutes in the first one. If you combine those two 'flash forward scenes' you'll get in less than 10 minutes a better movie than this disaster. That alone can tell you my opinion of this movie. You can see that efforts have been made but there's no involvement in the movie, it's dull, unoriginal and uninspiring. The third was already a step down but this is worse in my opinion. Don't watch it, there's no point, it just ruins a series that was already compromised by the 'rise of the machines'."

","Terminator Salvation The Directors Cut. A film I am very impressed with it was everything I hoped for, everything I dream-ed. Full of action and intensity. Sam Worthington is a welcomed fresh face to me this maybe the first film that I have seen him in. His portrayal of Marcus Wright was absolutely off the chain awesome...e. Marcus Wright a death row inmate who gets a second chance at life after he sells his body to science. A man who is as they say comes back more human then human. I guess the cast was told to read the book Do Abdriods Know Their Sheep while they were filming this film. The book Bladerunner is based on. Marcus Wright may be the Protagonist of this movie. It is a toss up between him and John Conner portrayed by Christian Bale. None the less I am impressed with both of these Thespians performances. They say that when a movie is shot correctly the setting is just as important as the leading stars and this film proves that in spades. The film is very post apocalyptic with many surviving people building rival colonies of vigilant thieves. Kind of like the Mad Max or Snake Plisken motion pictures. With all of the destrucion and debree as far as the eye can see, with very little left standing. Only with big giant man killing robots who's soul design is to enslave humanity. The music used in this film was awesome it took me back to the nineties with the track from Guns and Roses as well as Alice In Chains. Back in the day when grunge and alternative rock were the mainstream genre of choice. This film featured one of my favourite and most memorable film moments ever between Sam Worthington and Helena Bonham Carter. The common law Mrs. Tim Burton. Whos presence in this film adds a certain element in my humble opinion. With her resume of dark fairy tales and twisted characters on screen. Need I remind you folks of Fight Club, Sweeney Todd, Mary Shelley's Frankenstien and countless others. Anyways I got a little sidetracked their. The scene happened right at the beginning of the movie were she is playing presumably a cancer patient who asks death row inmate Marcus Wright to sell his body to science. He agrees on one condition that she gives him a kiss. He kisses her and says ""Now I know what death tastes like."" The film critics on At The Movies Ben Lyons and Ben Malcowits gave the theatrical version of this movie very negative reviews. Claiming this movie was unfulfilled trash with no substance. I say how dare you both. I thought this film had plenty of substance and that the films premise and delivery was completely engaging. Perhaps these fellas were just not in this films demographic or perhaps the MPAA and the mother against violence protest groups payed them off."

I also felt the character Blair was a bonus, played by the beautiful Moon Bloodgood, who sizzled on screen from the very first moment.<br/><br/>Christian Bale is without a doubt a great actor, but here he seems to have done this film for the money...His acting is as cold as the machines, no emotions and his voice strangely sounds the same as 'Batman'...<br/><br/>All in all, a good action movie."

","i saw this movie twice this past summer and both time i really enjoyed it. recently a friend asked me about it and said that he didn't see it because he doesn't like Christian bale, i told him the movie was good and that the main character is not really bale but the terminator. i do like bale as an actor but trailers sold this movie on him being the main focus when in the opening credits you become aware of the fact that he is not. my theory on movies is that within the first 10 minutes of a movie you see the main character and generally the first trailers released show more truth about a movie than later one. when this movie released its trailers it was bales voice over but hardly any scenes with him in it (by the way a scene with a terminator coming out of the water behind bale underground was never in the movie but it was in multiple trailers, disappointing) my favorite part of the movie is the fight between bale/Connor and the t-800/animated Arnold. when this scene starts you hear the music start up and the t-800 walk out of smoke showing a young Arnold face, awesome. this movie does seem to have parts not needed like hostel human groups in two different scenes and a drawn out scenes that could have been shorter. one thing that i was hoping to see was a fulls scale battle between the humans and machines, but who knows they have two more movies to make in this trilogy. besides those few things i really enjoyed the movie and recommend this movie to watch in theaters if you still can and as a buy when it comes out on DVD/bluray."

I did like this nods to the previous films although it seems they were just left in to tell viewers that this was a Terminator film.<br/><br/>The ""cameo"" by Arnold was incredible however, seemed a bit rushed and John Connors reaction a little too forced.

","In the future, John Connor leads the human resistance against Skynet, a worldwide force of sentient machines hell-bent on destroying mankind, whom are viewed as mortal enemies. In The Terminator, Arnold Schwarzenegger plays the title role, as a cyborg who has been sent back in time to kill John's mother Sarah Connor; it is believed that eliminating Sarah would prevent John from being born and allow the machines to ""win."" A man named Kyle Reese is also sent back, by the humans, to protect Sarah; he succeeds, hence Skynet's attempt fails, and we find out that Kyle ends up being the father of the unborn John Connor. Terminator 2: Judgement Day focuses on another killing machine, the T-1000, as it is sent back in time to kill John himself as a child, to fulfill the same purpose. Yet again, the machines are met with failure.<br/><br/>Way back when I saw Terminator 2 for the first time, I remember thinking that the storyline was one of the coolest in any of the movies I had seen. That was over 12 years ago, when I hadn't seen many movies to begin with. Even today, T2 stands as one of the best ever; the action, acting, music, and even special effects stand the test of time and still blow me away every instance I watch. The Terminator, which I saw very soon after, filled in all the gaps and then some to a franchise that haunts me to this day. Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines seems to be widely regarded as a critical failure and misstep in the series, a mockery of everything T1 had foretold and T2 had knocked out of the park: the antics of an aged Arnold Schwarzenegger, a ""Terminatrix,"" and a seemingly bad choice of actor for John Connor's character. I couldn't disagree more; Arnie once again rocked, Nick Stahl pulled off a wonderfully believable John Connor, and the twist ending in my mind made for a more than worthy addition to one of my all-time favorite movie series. And then there was the sadly now-defunct Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles TV series, also berated by many fans. I thought it was genius in every regard.<br/><br/>Fast forward to 2009, where director McG has unleashed Terminator Salvation upon the world. I had been looking forward to this film for many months, not only because it's another Terminator movie, but because McG had a trump card: Christian Bale of recent Batman fame as survivalist John Connor. I was absolutely certain that both of these beloved factors combined would make for yet another masterpiece that would be treasured in the Terminator collection. And days after I've seen it, I'm still not ready to determine whether or not it belongs there.<br/><br/>The Terminator series, in my mind, were always more than just action movies. They were foreboding, horrifying windows into the potential dangers of technology and nuclear war. The state of the planet after Judgement Day, the machine-initiated nuclear attack, as illustrated by James Cameron in T1 and T2, was dark, menacing, bleak, and felt frightfully real. Terminator Salvation changes that, not necessarily on purpose, but because the film feels like a repackaging of the first two, wrapped in the pretty red bow of current action movie pap all too common in today's world of short attention spans. Salvation focuses on two main things: John Connor trying to find and save the life of Kyle Reese (who turns out to be his father), and on a man named Marcus who wants revenge on the machines for very different reasons.<br/><br/>Fortunately, Salvation does do one thing very well: keep the viewer on the edge of their seat with tons of action sequences and great special effects. Those expecting another deep, existential, philosophical twist relating to the Terminator mythology however, will be disappointed. This is really the paradoxical thing about Terminator Salvation: I honestly did enjoy the movie. But I can't seem to lump it with the other Terminator movies. Maybe it's Christian Bale, whom I worship; he just plain and simple is not a good John Connor. He acts his tail off, but I can't help but feel that he was brought on board for ""star power."" Maybe it's McG's illustration of the state of the planet; post-Judgement Day is that of a desert wasteland, akin to the most recent movie outages of Resident Evil and Final Fantasy instead of the perpetual blackness and skull-ridden world of James Cameron. Maybe it's the lack of emotive or relatable music short of the five-beat drum pattern synonymous with the Terminator series. The whole thing feels, well, like someone did a Terminator movie just to do a Terminator movie.<br/><br/>Those willing to overlook these nuances, though, are in for a treat. Ripe with action, Salvation rarely lets the action movie reigns loose. Vehicle chases, gun battles, and Terminator versus human hand-to-hand all brings the action part of the movie full circle. Every turn is met with another shootout, another violent combat sequence, or another explosion. The introduction of Marcus's character is a good one, too, adding somewhat of a branch to Connor's ongoing focus, and towards the end of the movie, secrets are revealed relating to Marcus's character that I found quite interesting. In a risky move, Bale's Connor is a full-fledged military leader, both giving orders and taking them, and participates in several action scenes, including the long, final one that also includes a surprise cameo.<br/><br/>As a stand-alone action movie, Terminator Salvation is quite good, but will let down the longtime franchise fan. You'll be entertained, as long as you don't want to leave thinking about where the series will go next. As for me, I'd just as soon watch another season of The Sarah Connor Chronicles, ponder the events surrounding Judgement Day, and out of the corner of my eye see Terminator Salvation sticking out of my DVD collection waiting for a rainy day."

He didn't even take a break he went from one to another) B] Wouldn't the robots locate the source of the signal, realize there are humans manning that radio tower, and blow it up? Like they did at the end when they focused on all the radio signals? Like the entire conclusion of this movie? I guess robots like Alice in Chains. I can't blame em.<br/><br/>C] Maybe it was in the cd player? So lets say that you could possibly fix up a jeep that survived a nuclear fallout. What are you gonna bet that the cd player, or the cd for that matter, would still be in usable condition? I doubt any dust or other debris managed to fit into that hole when a NUCLEAR BLAST OCCURRED. MY cd player skips when i hit a pebble. My cd's don't work if there is so much as a thumb print on the back side.<br/><br/>And it was at this moment that i realized that the helicopter, from the beginning, should have gone down with the nuke cause of the EMP. And then later i realized how absurd it was for the robot facility to have a touch screen access panel that gave the person access to the entire system. If your enemy is a human, why not study them a bit and figure out their weaknesses and utilize their short comings in the design for software security? If humans have 5 senses, why have 2 of those, sight and touch, be anywhere near access to the important files? If your a computer speaking with another computer, why do you need a visual output in modern English? <br/><br/>End Spoiler <br/><br/>Yeah so other then that this movie was pretty terrible. I give it a 4 cause the special effects were absolutely amazing and the robots looked incredibly intimidating. I still wonder why they all had human faces? Oh well. Rent this. Do not buy."

","If you've never watched other 'Terminator' parts and you have no idea what happened before you can follow the history line as well without any problem. The problem is that this TS is connected with others only with names and global situation.<br/><br/>Right at the beginning of the movie we see the ultimate guy who's come from nowhere, who has (as we can see in the very end of the movie) the access to the machines' base. <br/><br/>The weird thing is that there's no more battle with a new version of terminator who came to present time to kill John or Sarah Connor, just a simple war of humans and machines, which we can see in many different movies. <br/><br/>My opinion. Advantages: -a good action movie with good graphics of good quality; Disadvantages: -no more actors from previous' parts; -no connection with previous' parts (just a history line and the main idea - humans vs machines);<br/><br/>As result i would give this movie a 6 just for a total sense, but i won't just because this is the 'Terminator' movie and i find this 4th part just lost and screwed up. So i'd give a 1 for producers' and writers' work.<br/><br/>As a fan of 'Terminator' movies I feel really disappointed. Screwed up. Take your '3'..."

","Mess is what one creates when an extremely successful franchise is striped off its core elements and goes high on firepower. The fourth installment thus comes to you, sans its icon, Arnold Schwarzenegger. Disappointing from the word go, you are left waiting for a coherent thread to evolve in the story. Probably, the lack of imagination has something to do with the absence of James Cameron, who it seems neither blessed nor cursed the idea of this film.<br/><br/>At around 2003, Marcus Wright (Sam Worthington), a convict on a death row agrees to give up his body to medical research. Cut to 2018, John Connor (Christian Bale), is leading his men against a Skynet base where finds the machines researching on developing a Terminator with a human tissue exterior. The mission ends in a blast leaving him the sole survior. Back at the Command, he realizes that his name is No.2 on the Skynet hit list with No.1 being Kyle Reese.<br/><br/>Though at first, Connor doesn't realize the importance of Reese, he soon learns from his mother's tapes that the latter, now still a teenager is the one that Connor would send into the past to protect his mother and to father him. Marcus meanwhile makes contact with downed pilot Blair Williams who brings him to the Resistance base. While treating an injured Marcus, the men realize that he is in fact a Cyborg with a metal endoskeleton sneaking into their base.<br/><br/>Now, John is faced with an uncomfortable situation of distrusting Marcus as he is a machine, and on other, to trust him, as he could be his only chance to rescue Reese from the clutches of Skynet. The climax of the story, not revealed here, is replete with humanoid Terminators, Hunter-Killer hover-crafts, giant human collectors and eel-like Hydrobots with the highlight being the cameo of the CGI of a youngish Schwarzenegger as the freshly developed T-800.<br/><br/>For a fact, most moviegoers have been fans of this franchise for the role portrayed by the muscle-man and to Cameron's imagination of bringing together the concepts of a holocaust, robots taking over the world, time travel, etc as far back as 1984 when the first Terminator hit the screens and when it was reprised in 1992. The third, released in 2003 sorely missed Cameron but somehow managed decent business with Schwarzenegger's presence.<br/><br/>Differing from its predecessors, the movie is not set in the present day but nearly a decade into the future. The well done special effects in shades of grey amplify the hollowness of the future where people eat two day old coyote to survive. Also notable are the rich tributes the makers have paid to its predecessors, including a duel with a severed Terminator, grabbing of shotgun and quotes such as ""I'll be back"" and ""come with me if you want to live"" among others.<br/><br/>Putting comparisons aside, fast paced action is the forte of Terminator Salvation. If mindless shows of firepower, robots, high speed bike chases are your taste, you probably won't regret watching it. However, all of its two hours sum up into nothing more than a video game set in the future. As much as I wanted to deride this disappointing movie, I have still given it a chance with 4 on 10 for its legacy value, thus putting it among the category of 'just average' flicks."

","I literally almost fell asleep in this movie! Terminator 4 was horrible! The whole film was dramatic drivel that fooled everyone to be a high-action pack movie. The whole film had 95 percent drama and 5 percent action. I have to say that Terminator 3 was way better and more intense than this one! Spoiler: Positive: Almost nothing except the audio sound was amazing, especially when things ignite you can feel the rumbling from your chair. That's it! Oh, and you get to see Arnold Schwarznegger or however you spell his name for five minutes IN A COMPUTER-GENERATED FORM! Negative: Oh my gosh, the excessive drama, and the slow-moving from one scene to another! All of us did not come to watch Terminator 4 to know the long explanation about mankind's destruction by the Skynet machines. We already known that from the previous films. The entire film was definitely confusing. Things just pop up out of nowhere, and the film to me felt like being an inescapable maze. The list goes on! It was just dull and unexciting! In the last 30 minutes of film was the point where this film began its series of action and battles! When the human-like machine figured his real fate, the people that created him explains that his purpose was destroying the Resistance and John Connor. This is when Arnold comes in as the Terminator, but instead of ending the film there, the human machine defeats Arnold and risks his life to save John Connor. The film should have ended with Arnold, which will portray that the Terminator kills John Connor, which fulfills the legacy of the Terminator sequels in the previous films. This film fooled me, but let this fool you!"

","This movie was... okay. Nothing much going on here other then some freakin' cool explosions. I have to admit, some of that was pretty neat. A few things were good but only 2 things were great.

His acting was great along with Worthington. Other then those two unknowns to me, the movie was mediocre with some good action sequences and explosions. There was a story... but I don't think it was developed enough (and yes, I have seen all 3 previous Terminators).<br/><br/>See this movie just for the great acting from those two.

"MovieMusings","5","1","4","26 May 2009"," Thumbs down
","I usually don't write ""in reaction"" to seeing a movie, however, on a number of levels, I've come to some clarity on how I feel about Terminator Salvation.<br/><br/>First (and this really helped me to be okay with my hesitation to embrace this film), I left the theater asking myself ""what do I think of this movie, how do I feel?"" and it dawned on me that having to ask is the problem - with previous Terminator movies (yes, even T3), it wasn't hard to decide, based on feeling alone, yeah or nay. The Terminator was just a whole lot of fun in a way previous sci-fi movies hadn't been able to achieve; T2 was a breathtaking statement with remarkably poignant scenes, while at the same time delivering special effects and action that changed things fundamentally; T3 was, for me, provocative, and the more I thought about it, the more I grasped some remarkable things. In all three, how I felt was clear, and I enjoyed them.<br/><br/>Which brings me to my next issue with Terminator Salvation: it fails the ""KISS test"" (""Keep It Simple, Stupid"").<br/><br/>A good comparative to this is with the Star Wars prequel trilogy. The original trilogy was not only groundbreaking, not only an epic saga, but it was simple enough for a kid to get. The prequel trilogy was so complicated it takes real thought for me to figure out all the new characters and plots and conflicts; it became a mess, exactly the opposite of what it originally was.<br/><br/>By the time I arrived at the end of Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines, I got the idea, and even chuckled to myself. I said ""the franchise is complete, we've come full circle. You can't stop the war, we knew that, the terminators came back because they were losing the war."" <br/><br/>But we knew enough - John Conner would lead a resistance, the machines would calculate that they were losing and hatch this crazy plot, going back in time, in a ditch effort to eliminate the source of their demise, the mother of John Conner. But, John Conner would not be killed in the past, our present, so that time would remain in an endless loop where machines neither won out or were prevented from existing at all. And such would be the conundrum of a movie based on the non-entity of time travel.<br/><br/>So, at the end of T3, I had no need for a sequel. While I wanted ""more terminator"", I had a sense of peaceful resolution that ""the story"", such as it was, had been told.<br/><br/>Then I heard a T4 was in the making, and I was really excited. ""Ok,"" I thought, ""so we're going to go into the future and see the world from which Arnold and Robert Patrick came, somewhat as it appeared from Reese's telling in T1."" We had visions of humans scraping to get by, HKs in the black skies and dog-fearing terminators infiltrating human dwellings, eyes like laser sights piercing the squalor...<br/><br/>I thought that we had a simple story to stick to.<br/><br/>Terminator Salvation was anything but. A new main character we knew nothing about, and which was used questionably to advance on the simple story that had somehow manages to engage us for 3 previous films.<br/><br/>Characters who demonstrate no development at all. Very little in the way of endearing emotive connections, no intimacies or anything remotely smacking of the human compassion and conditions for which humans were supposed to be fighting anyway, save for one scene where a woman says she feels a man's warmth, only to find out...well, although I warned there'd be spoilers, when you see it you'll appreciate how odd it was that this be the place and the characters to provide emotion, where in previous it was between Sarah and Reese and Sarah and John and John and the Terminator and Sarah and the Terminator, you know, the main characters.<br/><br/>From what I gathered in that article, the original script wasn't much better.<br/><br/>It seems that, any way you slice it, the original simple story was of such perfection that there was no place to go; which is supported by the fact that both the original script and this dog's breakfast of a re-write both fail monumentally.<br/><br/>Terminator has had such an impact, and set the bar so high, it really was unreasonable to expect that level could be maintained."
"Adorable","5","1","4","26 May 2009"," Decided our fate in a microsecond: another sequel
","What a tragedy this movie represents, squandering as it does an opportunity to not only revive one of the most revered sci fi franchises ever, but take it in a direction fans have long yearned for.<br/><br/>Of course, we saw the disappointment coming, being cynical and jaded, and the Star Trek movie from Bad Robot's J.J Abrams was also a recent indicator. Like the new Terminator, it too has failed to re-ignite the spark of the originals. Plus, both of these movies fail to incorporate as simple a hallmark of excellence as a soundtrack – in the Terminator's case, Brad Fiedel's unmistakable theme for the first two movies doesn't show up at all in the new release. What a sad joke.<br/><br/>It's also a tragedy in light of the excellent build up we got prior to the movie's premier, with very distinct trailers and posters that played well on the theme of a machine-dominated world. Too bad Terminator Salivation quickly turns into Terminator ho hum once you sit down to watch the thing.<br/><br/>The setting is one everyone's been waiting for since 1984. We finally get an entire movie dedicated to the war between surviving humans and Skynet, the head AI behind the machine civilization. Up until now, we only had snippets and glimpses into this war, and getting a better look at it has been a long time coming.<br/><br/>Now, unlike a few others in the blockbuster business, Terminator Salvation doesn't constitute a reboot, it simply plays with the franchise's building blocks a bit, but sticks to tradition well. It opens with a quick description of the machines' war against humanity, just like the first movie did, and has a slew of tributes to the previous movies in store – down to that Guns 'N' Roses song from T2 and a reversed Mack vs. motorcycle chase scene.<br/><br/>All this bodes well for proceedings, but alas amounts to very little – Salvation's another hackneyed actioner, with the same shoddy logic and rather idiotic shortcuts you'd expect to find in a straight to DVD release. This is definitely not your father's Terminator – that one had style AND intellect. And a bunch of memorable one-liners, something totally absent in this PG-13 (ouch) outing.<br/><br/>Christian Bale plays resistance leader John Connor, the man responsible for organizing humanity against the Skynet overlords and their robot armies. This is the first time we felt Bale to be lacking as an actor, ever. The others aren't much better, except Sam Worthington, who's quite brilliant as Marcus Wright, a very unique character that's like a bridge between the warring factions, if you will.<br/><br/>You also get lackluster performances from sexy Moon Bloodgood (8 Below, Street Fighter: Legend of Chun Li), Common and Anton Yelchin (Chekov from Star Trek, incidentally). The story revolves around Skynet trying to fool the resistance and the resistance trying to break Skynet defenses, but in the end it's all for naught and the rushed, often ludicrous conduct of the plot leaves you alternating between yawns and facepalms.<br/><br/>The effects and action are great, the movie certainly deploys an inventive army of evil robots, and the classic hunter-killers never looked this good. That's not enough, though, nor is a CGI Arnold (you call this a cameo?) or a voice-only appearance by Linda Hamilton.<br/><br/>This movie was our chance to pay real tribute to the series, add to the story, reveal what was waiting to be revealed, and play on John Connor's obvious emotional potential. Instead, here's a formulaic number with the requisite wink at a sequel and the impact of an endoskeleton made of Philly cheese."

I also liked the later scenes where he questioned what he was somewhat and eventually rejected what he learned.<br/><br/>John Conner on the other hand was just a (they made me delete the word here)in the entire movie. It was clear the movie was never supposed to be about him and when Bale forced the issue all we got was crap. Then the ending was just awful. Spoiler ahead – When Marcus chose to give up his life for John I was just wanted to walk out. What an awful ending. I mean I expected Marcus to die, and I am OK with that but not to save Conner.

With McG at the helm and a Walt Disney rating, I went in with some low expectations, but what I wasn't ready for was just how bad the story was going to be. Will they ever make a movie where John Connor is the leader of the resistance? I am so tired of waiting to see him lead the charge. I want a film where we are in the future and John is leading the humans and kicking Skynet's robotic butt across the planet. The ""resistance command"" treated John like he was a nothing and I am not interested in seeing that. I want to see the humans fight back under John and win. Also, where were all the cool weapons we saw the resistance use in the flashbacks scenes in the previous films?

","This installment has faults on so many levels that I wish I had those precious 2 hours I spend watching the film back. While some of the visual effects are enjoyable (the only reason I didn't give it a 1 out of 10) the story is paper-thin at best and whether or not you are angered by the fact that the entire Terminator ""storyline"" throughout the first films is basically botched, you will be annoyed by the fact that even in this sci-fi/action film, things happen that just couldn't happen. Fatal injuries become just a scratch, ""plot twists"" are obvious a mile away with heavy foreshadowing, and Skynet is both unimpressive and, frankly, a little stupid.<br/><br/>Fans of the Terminator mythology need to leave their attachment aside while watching this film. The tie-ins and references to the other films are few and very disappointing. After reading the synopsis of the ORIGINAL script on CHUD.com (before McG let Christian Bale re-write it) I can confirm it would have at least been much more interesting."
"tchockythegreat","6","1","4","25 May 2009"," Lacks imagination and could have played to its strengths more
","In Terminator Salvation, director McG creates a stark vision of a future in which a devastated world is filled with killer robots and humans who will do anything to survive. It's visually sublime, at times exciting, and introduces an interesting new character to the series. But while it's a decent part-reboot/part-continuation of the Terminator franchise, not to mention a marked improvement over Jonathan Mostow's forgettable Terminator 3, what keeps it from reaching the upper echelon of quality summer popcorn movies is a lack of fun and a story and characters that could have been beefed up a bit.<br/><br/>The first Terminator film was an old-fashioned low-budget monster movie that nonetheless contained some frighteningly visceral imagery. The second film remains to this day one of the greatest action flicks of all time; groundbreaking film-making on a number of levels. Despite the first two films in the series being worlds apart in some respects, the things they had in common, besides some entertaining action, were interesting characters as well as a sense of fun and innovation. Terminator Salvation, in contrast, is generally lacking in all three of these areas.<br/><br/>The movie opens in the year 2003 with a death-row inmate, Marcus Wright (Sam Worthington) agreeing to release his body to the custody of Cyberdyne Industries for research after his execution. Despite a bit of awkward scripting in this scene, Worthington and Helena Bonham Carter (cameoing as a Cyberdyne researcher dying of cancer) make it work; a demonstration of how talented actors can at times overcome a weak script.<br/><br/>That said, Worthington's Wright is by far the most interesting character in the movie, and the movie fares its best when it makes him the focus, in part due to his character being the closest thing the movie offers to a new wrinkle in the franchise mythology. His interactions with a teenage Kyle Reese (Anton Yelchin), whom he meets while wandering the ruined streets of Los Angeles, periodically inject the movie with some desperately-needed humor. Worthington's low-key, understated performance is pitch-perfect; he is believable as a badass whose mere existence makes him vulnerable, and movie-goers will likely wish that the film would have firmly focused on Wright's struggle to both deal with the reality of the world he awakened to as well as solving the mystery of what exactly happened to him after his ""execution."" In contrast, the activities of the human resistance, led in part by an adult John Connor (Christian Bale), seem strangely tacked-on, fairly aimless up until the point in the film in which Connor and Wright finally cross paths. This is not the fault of the performers; all the actors do as good a job as can be expected for a movie such as this. Bale's Connor is thankfully (for the most part) not the clone of his Batman persona that the trailers at times had suggested it might be. As was the case in Star Trek, Yelchin succeeds in playing the plucky, resourceful teenager. Carter's cameo is fantastic despite it being a bit under-written, and her presence alone makes you wish the writers had done more with the role she was given. But the clear standout is Worthington, in part because his role is the one that is scripted the strongest.<br/><br/>McG's version of the future is fittingly bleak and colorless, and his periodic allusions and homages to the previous Terminator movies are a nice touch. Despite some impressive visuals, however, the viewer will easily detect a lack of imagination in McG's directing job. For example, much of the early action comes off as little more than a hybrid of Mad Max and Transformers (the ""Transforminator"" ridicule many of you have likely heard of by this point is well-deserved), while the climatic battle at the end of the film is almost a shot-for-shot remake of the one at the end of Terminator 2. It's not that the action is never exciting or fun to watch (which it is at times); it's simply not anything you haven't seen before. His pacing during the film's quieter moments is a bit hit-and-miss as well; it will become clear to the viewer that McG can direct action much better than he can drama after seeing how awkward some of the conversations between the characters are.<br/><br/>Enough was entertaining in this film to give me hope that the inevitable fifth Terminator film will be willing to return to the core ideals that made the series a marquee franchise; interesting characters, innovative action, and a sense of fun. For now, we're stuck with just another hunk of over-buttered, seen-it-before summer popcorn that takes itself way too seriously."
"pacrat90","4","1","4","24 May 2009"," Good effects and killer robots make for an average action flick
","The thing is, the Terminator franchise used to be much much more than average. The first Terminator was well acted, exciting, and original. The second Terminator was revolutionary, very exciting, and had an even better story to tell. I didn't bother with the third Terminator, but I can tell that it was a large step down from the first two movies. And now we have...Terminator Salvation. Is it terrible like some viewers have declared vehemently? Not really, but it's a major disappointment. If this had not been a Terminator movie, I probably would have liked it a little better.<br/><br/>To begin with, the story was pretty laughable and riddled with plot holes. I could go into every little one, but the most blatant of these plot holes is at the end when John Connor strolls into SkyNet's headquarters and gets attacked by a grand total of THREE terminators. There was a whole factory of them being made, and yet John Connor only had to fight THREE. Puh-lease. On a related note, why didn't Skynet program Marcus to be an ACTUAL sleeper agent and attack John Connor himself, rather than making him go to all the trouble of luring John into a trap at their headquarters? Has Skynet ever heard of Occum's Razor? Apparently not. Besides being filled with gaping plot holes, it was also a fairly conventional story. Moon Bloodgood's character falling in love with Marcus was not that compelling. John being saved by Marcus in the end was predictable. John ignoring the top brass and saving the prisoners anyway was foolhardy and also predictable.<br/><br/>OK so the story was weak, but Christian Bale was awesome at least... right??? Oh how I wish it were so. I am a huge fan of Bale and I have seen several of his movies, but this is probably the worst performance I've seen from him. He was nowhere near as good an action hero as he was in Batman Begins or even The Dark Knight (where he had a fairly wooden performance, but some good lines). He basically had two modes in this movie: solemn or yelling. Heck the robots probably had more personality than him. Moon Bloodgood as the main heroine was forgettable and didn't fit well in the movie. Helena Bonham Carter had a brief role in the film, but was still not that inspiring as the Doctor (and I guess the incarnation of Skynet later too). Sam Worthington had the best performance in the movie and portrayed the troubled ex-con Marcus pretty well. However, it certainly wasn't good enough to salvage this mess.<br/><br/>Alright alright so who cares if the plot is thin and the acting is bad if the action scenes are intense and exciting? Well the special effects for the robots are certainly top notch. McG DOES know how to direct action sequences at least. The scene with the giant robot with the cage attached to it was particularly fun to watch. Yet, even the action scenes felt more lackluster than they should, and I think I know why. If you don't give a rat's ass what happens to the characters in the story, it doesn't really matter whether they're fried by a giant robot's laser beams or dropped into a river...now does it? Overall, this film could have been so much better. It had a good score by Danny Elfman, some nice nods to the first two movies (I'm looking at you superimposed Ahnald), good special effects, and decent action scenes. It even began somewhat promisingly with the prison scene set in 2003 and the assault on the Skynet base in 2018, but then it quickly degenerated into mindless action and John Connor yelling every other line. What a shame.<br/><br/>Entertainment: 5/10<br/><br/>Quality of Film-making: 3/10"

Had some flaws, have to admit, but it was strong nonetheless. Everything connected and there was definitely an ""aaaah"" moment and of course a ""wow, that rocks"" moment.<br/><br/>Great, with a capital G, acting! Christian Bale and Sam Worthington, the two main protagonists of the movie, put up one good show. The chemistry is just pure solace. Anton Yelchin, at first, I thought could not be the best choice to play Kyle Reese, who from what I remember from T1, was freaking hot. But, the dude actually pulled it quite well.

The next 1 hr and 30 minutes = I had too much terminator, eyes cannot close.<br/><br/>Two disappointing things about this movie. a) the background score, what is up with that. Either there was no score, or it did not make a good impression on me for me to remember how it went! I am disappointed only with that. Hans Zimmer would have been a good choice, no questions asked! b) the ending. sorry, but I was hoping something else entirely. You would know when you see it. But even so, with this ending, the movie still rocked my day!<br/><br/>So, my suggestion would be to catch this movie as quickly as you can! and make sure you learn your Terminator Trivia before doing so.

"CinemaClown","Null","1","5","29 June 2015"," Loud, Intense & Bombastic But Also Downright Stupid, Hollow & Soulless
","Loud, intense & bombastic but also downright stupid, hollow & soulless, Terminator Salvation is the fourth instalment in the franchise that was already a full circle with two films, before it got dented by an unnecessary third chapter. And although this sequel might be the worst of the series so far, it still makes up for a more entertaining flick than Rise of the Machines.<br/><br/>Set 14 years after Judgment Day eradicated much of humanity, Terminator Salvation follows a death row inmate who donated his body for medical research before his execution in 2003 yet happens to be alive in the post-apocalyptic future where he finds himself caught in the war between humans & machines and learns about his upgraded identity after coming face to face with John Connor.<br/><br/>Directed by McG, Terminator Salvation is completely devoid of any sort of substance, has no redeeming value despite salvation in its title & is so full of plot holes that the entirety of the picture is one big facepalm moment. But thanks to its vicious pacing, non-stop action, high-definition photography & volatile atmosphere, it also manages to be a relatively fun, entertaining & less tedious affair than the previous entry.<br/><br/>The bleak, desaturated look of the post-apocalyptic setting is captured in crisp detail, the screenplay is an absolute mess, visual effects is striking for the most part, CGI-laden action is engaging & ridiculous at the same time, its entire premise doesn't even has any reason to exist, character depth is nil, the final twist explaining one character's fate is laughable, and Danny Elfman's score is disappointing for it adds nothing to its story.<br/><br/>Coming to the performances, the cast comprises of Christian Bale, Sam Worthington, Bryce Dallas Howard, Anton Yelchin & Helena Bonham Carter, and everyone is terrible in his or her given roles. Bale hams like never before in the role of John Connor, Worthington does have a few moments to his name, Yelchin takes the role of young Kyle Reese, Dallas Howard is in as Connor's wife & simply exists, and even Bonham Carter chips in with a forgettable input.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, Terminator Salvation is an effects-driven sci-fi actioner that features an entirely different setting compared to its predecessors yet not an ounce of logical storyline. The action in the first act is quite intense & interesting but from there on, it's only a downhill process. Nevertheless, I did have an enjoyable time with the action sequences this film had in store & while it's no better in quality than its equally dull predecessor, it's less frustrating to a considerable extent."

This movie contained more strobe-lights than a rave. I am disappointed that the producers were not sensible enough to provide viewers the courtesy warning that is so often seen on videos with far less stroboscopic effects. It shows a blatant lack of awareness and it looked cheap and pointless anyway-- like overdone slow-motion or bad wire-work, an overabundance of pointless strobes makes a movie feel cheap.<br/><br/>As for a Terminator movie-- it was pretty awful mindless violence but still better than T3 (who remembers that?)

"anarchpatriarch","5","1","5","14 June 2009"," Hardly A Terminator Movie At All
","As a big Terminator fan, I've been waiting for the post-apocalyptic Terminator movie since the first Terminator came out. Even back then, I expected it would be heavily action-based, but would at least keep some of the horror-movie charm that the first Terminator had.<br/><br/>I was mistaken.<br/><br/>Terminator: Salvation is really nothing more than an average summer action flick. Complete with minimal story and little background explanation for newer characters, the only thing that will keep you interested are the fancy explosions and occasional references back to what should be called ""The Original Series,"" because I hardly consider this part of the original trilogy.<br/><br/>The references to The Original Series are one of the few things this movie did well. John Connor's background in his conflicting trusting in the Terminators and being immediately skeptical of ones that claim to be ""on the human's side"" or something to that degree, is very well expressed, even with Christian Bale's angeringly poor depiction of the John Connor we all know and love. I've always figured the future John Connor would be *more* of a military leader than the John Connor we've seen before, but Christian Bale is ridiculous. He seemed to care too much about how loud he could roar and how bad-ass he would appear in the final product. I'm not exaggerating, at least 70% of his lines are screamed. I'm reminded of how his Batman-voice became more of a growl than a human voice.<br/><br/>Overall, the film isn't worth seeing, and it certainly won't be added to my collection of T-DVDs."

"PetrolMan","5","1","5","24 May 2009"," Nothing Special, Not Even Good
","Terminator Salvation is a mediocre and unoriginal film. I sat through the film and wasn't ever bored, but I was also never really enjoying myself. There are simply too many problems with the movie. The story is a poorly thought out mess that develops in an inconsistent way partially because no one ever bothered to really develop the characters.<br/><br/>Marcus Wright is probably the worst character overall. He committed an act of murder that is never described in the movie and is looking for some kind of salvation (yeah, real clever). The problem is that this mysterious past feels like such a terrible clichÃ©. Even worse are all of the incredibly dumb lines talking about second chances. The actor who played Marcus is also terrible considering that his Australian accent appeared during any scene that required the least bit of emotion or volume. Any time the actor couldn't use a flat, steady delivery, he turned into Robo-Aussie.<br/><br/>Christian Bale, who I like, doesn't even deliver a good performance. I blame this more on directing and an overall terrible script than on him, but I can say this is one of his worst performances that I can remember. There is more to say about this, but ultimately the problem is that the characters were never well developed and it shows. The only possible exception is the Kyle Reese character and even that is a stretch.<br/><br/>Another big problem with the movie is that it appears to be a simple mash up of ""cool"" ideas from other movies. The giant robot seems to put out diesel exhaust like in Transformers. The set pieces for the prison camp look like they were stolen from Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome. The Skynet facility with its random flames and central spire seem like they were inspired by The Lord of the Rings' Mordor. Borrowing from other movies is not in itself bad, but the way it was executed was distracting and bothersome.<br/><br/>The same is actually true of the scenes that are inspired by the other Terminator movies. Does another Terminator really have to be burned and frozen? Really? Do you really need to create an almost exact copy of the scene from the first movie showing the Terminator walk up stairs? Does one robot really have crush the chest of another one with a large beam or concrete slab on chains, again? In fairness, these scenes bothered me whereas others might really appreciate them. I simply felt they were done in such hokey ways as to be distracting. All of these scenes just felt they were the product of uninspired, lazy writing and a fan boy mentality. I mean, seriously, another battle in an industrial complex?<br/><br/>I guess to make a long review short, I thought the movie was terribly written. I will never understand why all of Skynet's robots in this movie were bipeds since it is a pretty terrible design and the big robots from the first movie were actually on tank treads. I'll never understand how Marcus and Blair Williams (who is also a terrible character) fall in love so quickly. I will never understand why the writers even bothered trying to kill John Conner and setting up the terrible heart transplant scene. I really don't even know why Arnold's face is in the movie but I will let that one slide.<br/><br/>The movie is decently entertaining if you can shut off your brain and deal with plot holes, poor character development, and terrible writing and directing. I am relatively certain there is probably some fan fiction that is better written than this mess. But, ultimately, the movie is still decently entertaining, so I have to give it a few stars."
"Chris Knipp","6","1","5","22 May 2009"," It's dark and gloomy without Arnold
","It's 25 years since the original 'Terminator,' starring Arnold Schwartzenegger and written and directed by James Cameron, but our memories aren't too dim to recall how much silly loud fun that movie was, in comparison. Arnold and James also teamed up for the slightly less successful but still breathtakingly exciting 'Terminator 2.' Cameron left Arnold to his own devices (or rather another director) for the still less successful, but nonetheless highly profitable and arguably quite entertaining 'Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines,' which heralds the situation chronicled in this still louder and more high tech and more fatalistic 'Terminator' blockbuster, which has had just about all the fun squeezed out of it. What a pity Arnold was too busy struggling with California's hopeless state budget to lend his endearingly wooden charm and outsize body to this movie. The first thing that's wrong with this version is that the machines have no personalities, not even an Austrian weightlifter's.<br/><br/>We have to begin with a sci-fi plot device I can never quite understand: that the hero must enter the past to change things so the future--that is, the present--can turn out the way it is already. Or at least that's how it seems to me. I just find it hard enough living in the present. If anybody can go back and tinker with history, like Dick Cheney, at just about any time, what's the use? But this is the essence of the 'Terminator' franchise: delving back into the past to change things so your side, be it humanity or the evil cyber world, will have an edge.<br/><br/>Throughout the series, humankind has been enslaved by machines. (Now that part I get.) A man named John Connor leads a revolt of the human slaves. How do we know that, if it's changeable? There's always that struggle from one film to the next over going back in time to prevent Connor from being born, or kill him off as a kid, or make sure he is born. This could go on forever; but then franchises are designed that way.<br/><br/>What's equally mystifying in this cool-looking, stylistically distinctive, but relatively more pointless 'Terminator' film, the fourth in the franchise, is that this appears to be at least partly a prequel (maybe any time-travel story is?), but it's also thoroughly post-apocalyptic. The world, which just to keep things convenient let us call Los Angeles, is now a post-nuclear holocaust wasteland of broken metal and minefields. John Connor is Christian Bale. But--and this is another thing I can't quite follow--his dad, Kyle Reese, is among the prisoners, in the youthful form of Anton Yelchin, no longer spouting a Russian accent as in the new 'Star Trek'. And of course Anton has to be protected because the machines are out to kill him, because. . .well, if we know the series, we know why. Couldn't they just kill Christian Bale? Well, they'd like to, but they simply can't, because, well, he's Batman, you know, and he's a real s.o.b. as well.<br/><br/>The ghost in the machine, so to speak (the machine of this rather mechanical sequel) is Marcus Wright (Sam Worthington), a prisoner on death row in the film prelude who signs his body over to Helena Bonham Carter for ""research."" Somehow he pops up fifteen years later, very confused about what he is. A pity the muscular Worthington is rather bland, because he plays a pivotal role either as nemesis or salvation, it's not certain which.<br/><br/>A cyborg gives his heart that Christian Bale may live, which seems rather appropriate given the apparently dysfunctional Bale's rude manners both on screen and off. Bale is relentlessly one-note as the leader in battle against the man-killer machines, and the anticlimactic ending states that the war remains yet to be won. All that's been accomplished is a lot of explosions (set off nicely by the dark, monochromatic visuals) and a lot of ornately bent-up metal, somewhere in what is referred to as Los Angeles. Let's hear it for the explosions (as well as the fires, the detonators, the electro-shocks, the crashes, the monstrous death's-head creatures, and the computer-readout thingies, for this is their film, and they light it up both literally and figuratively against the prevailingly dark and ashen landscape). Nothing else much matters, other than a brief and shining moment when what looks like a naked Arnold does battle with Christian Bale. In the other 'Terminator' movies, especially the first two, there was a lot more human interest. Even the machines were (almost) human, and that made all the difference. All the noise and violence are very well done, but they're not as pretty as 'Star Trek's.' Space makes an even nicer background for a big explosion than a nuclear wasteland."
"prezike","6","1","5","22 May 2009"," More like 'Terminator Salvage Job'
","I came into the theaters on opening night with fairly low expectations after reading some critical reviews - one of which used the term I am borrowing a bit here - calling it 'Terminator Salvage.' I was hoping to be pleasantly surprised, and while the film will surely please some, for many others it may leave you feeling disappointed with this once mighty and critically acclaimed franchise.<br/><br/>The effects and art direction were well done, but that's not saying much for action movies these days, nor is it enough to carry a film if you are interested in more than things blowing up. A strength of the previous Terminator films was that it was a sci-fi series that had a sort of realism that allowed many viewers to buy into the story. Over-the top acting, difficult to fathom plot lines, and things that seem to go against what we learned in previous films make the picture drag. Some actors struggle with the material, and Bale also seems generally as disinterested as he reportedly was before singing on, yelling his way through the film, and doing his an imitation of his voicing of Batman.<br/><br/>Of course, there will be those that will come away enjoying it, but after growing up a huge Terminator fan and seeing it, i was not particularly impressed after the early part of the movie, and i will think for many who once loved this series you may not feel the kind of intense chill and suspense that the machines once portrayed to the audience. Inclusions of the cute, mute child character reminds me of how Jar Jar Binks seemed misplaced in 'The Phantom Menace' and another example of how 'Terminator Salvation' strays from the first two movies, perhaps in pursuit of an even wider audience (which could also explain the PG-13 rating, versus R ratings for the previous 3).<br/><br/>Sadly we get a fairly mediocre and forgettable film that perhaps was not in the right hands, direction wise with McG. 'Terminator Salvation' is not awful, but not worth garnering any kind of significant praise. You know when you are laughing and it's not intentional, unless a film maker wishes to seek cult status for all the wrong reasons (like a movie that people do drugs with in a group to make fun of) this is not a good thing."
"TheMovieDiorama","4","1","6","29 June 2018"," Terminator Salvation does not save the franchise but instead leads it down a dark generic apocalyptic tunnel.
","McG. Really? That was the best director you could obtain to act as your salvation for this franchise? Mc-flipping-G!? Christ. Let me clear something up, Salvation isn't necessarily a bad film. If it wasn't attached to a franchise it would work quite well, but alas it's got the old Terminator name magnetically attracted to the title and so was doomed from the start. Set after 'Judgment Day', John Connor leads the resistance and encounters Marcus, a miraculous survivor who was condemned to a death sentence, who claims that John's past father Kyle Reese is captured by Skynet. Blah blah blah, convoluted convoluted convoluted, makes little to no sense. Ever since the third chapter, the whole paradoxical storyline is illogically derivative that each instalment just adds to the complexity of the plot. Instead of focusing on John Connor, which is clearly the strongest element to this story played aggressively by Bale, we are introduced to Marcus. A character, that was utterly destroyed by the terrible marketing (I mean that trailer...), who's sole purpose is to convey the message of the film. Illustrating the boundary between the end of humanity and the start of artificial intelligence. Good intentions, but executed heavy handedly. Plus, considering he is supposed to be a conflicted personality, my word is he ridiculously uninteresting. Worthington, Yelchin and Bonham Carter all give fine performances, but the expositional script prevent them from shining through the rusty apocalyptic environment. Bleak, dingy and dull, nothing here has life. The action set pieces, again, were fine and completely watchable. The visual effects for the most part are decent, where the sound mixing of robotic noises really elevate the futuristic world. Despite these ""fine"" neutral points, it's a generic film that feels generically generic in all its full genericism. It serves absolutely no purpose other than to consume your time with flashy futuristic action set pieces. Salvation, you've been terminated."

Unfortunately it quickly disappointed, going the way of its predecessors: great CGI, but no plot. It just drifts from one mindless explosion-filled scene to the next.<br/><br/>In keeping with the one-dimensional storyline, the acting is fairly wooden.

I wanted this to be the first decent Cameronless Terminator film and looking back now once McG was thrown into the directors chair I should have preparedy myself for the abomimation that was to be released.<br/><br/>Story Issues: Marcus being more advanced than the yet to be produced T-800 John Connors daddy issues and being married to a redhead Skynet being smart enough to be self aware and rule the world and know Kyle Reese is the key to getting rid of Connor yet let Kyle survive and escape when he is captured and at Skynet HQ. Yet smart enough to let the resistance think that the frequency they have can bring down their network only for it to be a trap and they blow up resistance HQs submarine then making Connor leader of the resistance. The original scripted ending was far superior and from what I've read was changed on account of ""ive smoked too many Marlboros"" Christian Bale.<br/><br/>Characters: John Connors a cock head.Don't yell so much and no doubt 20 years of being told you're the chosen one for mankind will boost anyones ego to god-like<br/><br/>Marcarse-Could've been interesting,shouldn't be there,acts and talks like a robot even before he knows hes one.Guess that comes down to Plankingtons acting chops.<br/><br/>Kyle-Whinge whine whine.Michael Beihn needs to punch you in the throat.<br/><br/>Skynet-Dumbest world ruling super computer ever<br/><br/>Tim Burtons Husband-WHY?<br/><br/>I could go on and on with this but my toilet needs cleaning.

","I sat this one out in the theaters. I heard all the haters cry about it, but knew I'd see it eventually. I finally saw it on my sweet ass Samsung and in BluRay. I really REALLY like this movie. It's much cooler than the last 2 films. I know that, for many a geek, T2 was the equivalent of Star Wars for anyone younger than 14 when T2 released. But I hated that movie then, and my hatred has been justified over time. T2 sucks for the same reasons the last 3 Star Wars films sucked. Garbage dialogue, horrible acting, and the pussification of iconic villains. Directors who ruin their masterpieces should be forced to sponge bathe lepers in Calcutta.<br/><br/>In ""Terminator"", Arnold was terrifying and BRUTAL. In ""T2"" he's a fecking truck- stop t-shirt. He's C3PO with biceps. And if I could go back in time, I'd beat James Cameron with a tire iron for thinking the banter between Arnie and Furlong was hip. It's nothing but insufferable assholery.<br/><br/>But 'Salvation' is down and dirty and the cast is superb. EXCEPT for the moon-faced daughter of Ron Howard. She's awful.

","Lets discuss Mr Dan Elfmans score of this film. The departure from the metallic and iconic score of Brad Fidel was suicidal. Not only does it have nostalgia attached to it, it also is sonically the perfect landscape for a Terminator and judgement day. The strings and the non-signature style make the music of absolutely no consequence, you can't remember it, it has no value. Now Elfman was very effective and industrial on Deconstruction Planet of the Apes and it is a great disappointment that someone so modern and post-futuristic would be so disappointing. To the film which is pretty bland and nonsense from the get go. The little ""Newt"" child seemed very Aliens. Apart from that the film lacks character and realism. Let's be honest you gonna attack Skynet and that is all the defences they have? Come on. 1 single terminator waiting for all of the resistance? Films should take you on a journey this film seems to just unroll in 1 day and is thin and without character. An on that subject there is absolutely no character building, if you haven't seen the series before you cannot attach to anything or anyone. So poor they actually even made Helena look dry. No character has any screen presence and definitely not Sam Worthington or Bryce. So on a casting note the film is pretty whack. But common, ironside, moon and maybe Jadagrace were nice to see. The only thing that makes this film watchable is the constant violence, and it doesn't take a genius to produce on screen violence."

I did, and I wasn't stunned by the story or blown away by the visuals, this time out it had an ugly Hollywood stench surrounding the whole picture. The action set pieces were stupendously boring and aloof. The cast were barely there, figuratively speaking, with Bale giving a half-hearted performance and the incredibly horrible casting of the Kyle Reese character. There were some nice throwbacks to the previous films, the only saving grace in my eyes, and a near brilliant sequence involving Conner, a radio, and a certain Guns and Roses song. My recommendation is if you've seen the other Terminators then this is a nobrainer, but if you haven't I strongly suggest to see T2 and if you become an instant fan, check this one out."

That's not a compliment; some of these Terminators look like Decepticons. <br/><br/>But this is a strictly passable entry in the franchise, one that promises plenty of guns and brooding combat but not very much else. A lot of this movie is mechanical - even Arnold's back via CGI workaround (though I will say they did a decent job rendering him; I was surprised by that).

","This is such a frustrating movie on many levels... where to start?<br/><br/>Its mood/tone is so inconsistent, it basically drops you off halfway through the film. The first half is dark and gritty, and if you're in the right mood, you might actually get quite immersed - at least if not being too nit-picky about smaller plot issues.<br/><br/>But before the final third or so, the filmmakers' childish obsession at dropping a ""cool"" reference to a certain scene in the second film absolutely shatters that tone to pieces. It's the single scene I will always remember this film mostly for, and I'm sure you know what I mean when you see it.<br/><br/>(T3 was goofy, and at least for purists, surely quite disappointing too, but at least its tone was more consistent.

And that's exactly what makes it so frustrating: for far too long into the movie, you're lead to believe that it could at least be decent.<br/><br/>Instead, it's just more ""cool"" references and nonsensical plot advancements from here on, that are all the more glaring now, after the first big one that I talked about. And of course, loads of mindless ""hollywood style"" action, that could be mildly entertaining, if you could build another wall - of indifference towards the film - in time. I couldn't.<br/><br/>All I could think of was how good the film could have been; hundreds of millions spent, with lots of skilled people on board, it still looked and sounded good (mostly), but it was impossible to appreciate, when every second scene just tried to reference or imitate stuff in the earlier classics - poorly, with no respect.<br/><br/>If you've never watched a Terminator movie before, and don't mind a terrible plot that doesn't make sense, if only there's lots of explosions and million-scale CGI, then you might consider TS passable.

","Considering this shares the same writers as the seriously flawed T3, and the questionable choice of relative unknown McG as director, and the questionable neutering of the series' feel via PG-13... it's OK for what it is: a mindless action flick.<br/><br/>There are many truly bad things about the movie, but for me there were also just enough good things to balance those out & leave me entertained. This is not a Terminator film at its core, especially because the terminators don't have the ruthless killing attitude they did in previous films. Instead of punching through a human's chest (T1 & T3), or stabbing someone in the head with its knife arm (T2), the terminators here just throw people around & punch real hard. It's simply not the same type of terror you feel in the earlier movies.<br/><br/>That said, I honestly have to give McG big props for some of the action scenes. The bridge chase and the early assault (and escape) on the Skynet base were very well done and intense. McG's choice to do one-take shots, and the camera panning for full 360 degree views of battles was impressive. Pretty much every scene with Marcus was awesome, thanks to Sam Worthington.<br/><br/>This is overall on par with T3, which hurts to say. T3 was a dull rehash of T2, but was overall decently produced. T4 is a fresh story for the most part, & does have very well done scenes, but then it also has enough cheese & truly awful scenes to make you realize how shoddy some of the production aspects for this must have been.<br/><br/>With a better, more focused script, and no rating restriction, I honestly believe McG really could've made something that respected & would be respected by Terminator fans. As is, this is just an OK action flick with a Terminator influenced side story."
"jboothmillard","3","1","13","30 April 2012"," Terminator: Salvation
","The first two Terminator films are brilliant, the third film stumbled into being almost ridiculous, and as I heard and saw more about this fourth instalment I knew it was going to be terrible, from director McG (Charlie's Angels, Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle). Basically the story opens in 2003 seeing criminal Marcus Wright (Avatar's Sam Worthington) from Longview State Correctional Facility heading for death row, but is convinced by cancer suffering Dr. Serena Kogan (Helena Bonham Carter) to donate his body for her research. Forward to the future, 2018, Judgement Day has happened, the missiles from Skynet launched and most of humanity has been destroyed, but there are survivors of the nuclear fire, including the fated Resistance leader John Connor (Christian Bale). While Skynet are building their army of human killing machines, including the new model Terminator the T-800, Marcus awakes from his coma with no clothes and no knowledge of what is going on, including about himself. Finding clothes he also finds teenager Kyle Reese (Anton Yelchin), who has been listening to the transmissions of Connor for some time and is keen to be part of the Resistance, so they and mute child Star (Jadagrace Berry) journey to find him. John hears about the existence of Reese, who he knows will be his father in the future, or rather in the past when he travels to 1984, and meanwhile he also offers to destroy a signal that may shut down the machines. John gets some help from his wife Kate (Bryce Dallas Howard) and downed pilot Blair Williams (Moon Bloodgood), but General Ashdown (Michael Ironside) is ignoring the fact that Connor will be the one to lead the war against the machines. Marcus eventually crosses paths with John, and he is shocked to discover that he is a machine, but he is a new type of machine with a soul and his own mind, yet John believes he is just like all the other machines and wants to destroy them. When Kyle gets kidnapped along with many survivors by the Skynet aircrafts, and they find the location of the signal transmitter, John and Marcus do eventually trust each other and go on the mission that could change the future. Also starring rapper Common as Barnes, Jane Alexander as Virginia and Ivan G'Vera as General Losenko. I should mention first that this film probably got more press for the events on set, when Bale was voice recorded going bonkers and losing his temper with a lighting man/director of photography while filming a scene, with lots of swearing and threats, but he apologised and the film was finished. Anyway, Bale does alright shouting his orders and fighting the computer generated Arnold Schwarzenegger, Worthington does give the much more interesting performance as the machine with a conscience and a heart (literally), the special effects are fine, but the Terminators look shabby, and there are some reasonably engaging action sequences, but you just feel like it is nearly same old same old, you may only titter at the catchphrases ""I'll be back"" and ""Come with me if you want to live"" too, a disappointing science-fiction action thriller. Adequate!"

"one9eighty","8","0","1","12 February 2020"," oooh, a prequel sequel, or is it a sequel prequel?
","In the grand scheme of Terminator films this is a weird one, possibly because it isn't an out and out rehash of a time travelling story as suggested in the 3 previous films. To start off with we witness a death row convict, Marcus Wright, being put to death. He wakes up and find that everything is different. He's in a wasteland and machines seem to be killing off all traces of humanity they find. He helps and befriends a couple of kids, one of them a young Kyle Reece (who you may know from the first Terminator film becomes the father of John Conner after he goes back in time). The kids are captured for termination leading Marcus to search for them. He ends up running into a resistance fighter who convinces him to go and meet the leader of the resistance, John Conner. An accident occurs which shows everybody that Marcus isn't quite what he thought he was - spoiler, he a half-man half-robot hybrid. Meanwhile, the resistance have a new weapon in their arsenal, a radio signal which can turn machines off - if it truly works then the resistance could bring Skynet down for good.<br/><br/>Despite the negativity in reviews, I really enjoyed this film, more than Terminator 3 in fact. It's a good addition to the franchise and it looks at things in a new way rather than rehashing old stories. This film sets itself in the future, which the antics of the previous films were fighting against. It's dark and its bleak, humanity is indeed on its last legs - if you have ever played the Fallout video games, it's that kind of a landscape. The film as a whole feels like what the first Terminator film promised the future would be like. There is an element of trying to ""save the present to save the past which saves the future which helps the present"" (don't get too confused), but it's done in a way that works out and adds to cannon. The cast all do a fine job, albeit my biggest criticism is casting Christian Bale as John Connor which I found a little off putting at times - frankly I'd have been happier with an unknown playing this role, but Bale still delivers a good performance. Sam Worthington is central vehicle to the film and was happy to follow his story and actions, I found him to be an emotive and compelling character in the film. While T3 almost parodies itself by continually nodding to previous films, this treats itself as an action film and doesn't try to be tongue in cheek, which works. There is a moment for the Arnie loyalists - and it's done a tasteful way which makes the T800 series seem like the baddest of the bad Terminator units there is.<br/><br/>I thoroughly enjoyed this outing and feel that this is more deserved of a place in the Terminator franchise than the previous T3 film. For me, this gets 8 out of 10."

","I have no qualms in saying that I have a soft spot for Terminator Salvation. T3, Genisys and, to a lesser extent, Dark Fate, all basically trod the same ground that the first two (undoubtedly brilliant) films did. What Salvation tried to do was progress the series, and, if the sequels had ever been made, take it to its logical conclusion. For that I applaud the film.<br/><br/>That's not to say that I bury my head in the sand and ignore the naysayers. Yes, the film has its flaws. For me though the good certainly outweighs the bad. If you've seen some of the Terminator films and you're not sure whether to watch Salvation I wholeheartedly recommend it. As much for what it tried to do as for what it did do right.<br/><br/>Ultimately though history will remember Salvation for its mixed reviews, no matter how epic I think the other two films in the planned (and never filmed) trilogy would have been."

With a decent but simple story and some good action scenes and a good twist at the end of the movie. This movie is not as good as other installments but still alot of fun.<br/><br/>The main problems I have is I was a little dissapointed with the future that we got I was expecting better and something more like the openings to the first two movie's but this just looks like a typical war film and I know its suppose to be a different Timeline but it's still a little disappointing.<br/><br/>I'm also not a fan of some of the machines in this one like Terminator motorbikes is a bit to much and cheesy for my taste.<br/><br/>Also apart from Christian Bale and Sam Worthington the performances are a little mediocre for a Terminator movie and sometimes it stands out.<br/><br/>However its still a fun movie with decent action and OK acting mainly from Christian Bale and Sam Worthington.
I really like Marcus Wright he is a great addition to Terminator and his story is really interesting and John Conner is OK in the movie.<br/><br/>The twist ending is very cool the idea of Skynet being the one who gave them the signal and set all this up as a trap using Marcus to kill John Conner was a great twist and felt like Terminator in my opinion.<br/><br/>Verdict 7/10 a fun film that I enjoy just have issues with.

","'Terminator Salvation (2009)' just about works as a sequel, despite having some timeline issues here and there, to the previous entries in the 'Terminator' series. However, it sort of feels inconsequential, almost like an anecdote from the oft-mentioned 'future war', and comes across as quite 'pointless', I suppose, because of it. It's also just really dull, not only in its narrative but also in its aesthetics. Whereas every prior glimpse of this time-period has been of a neon-infused, purple-tinted, now retro-future hell-scape, this flick opts to depict a generic, barren, almost 'Transformers (2007)'-esque wasteland shaded solely in dusty browns and rusty greys. It's not an inherently bad look, but the combination of stale style with spiritless substance makes for a generally bland experience. This extends to, essentially, every aspect. Even Christian Bale, a normally world-class actor, somehow manages to turn in a performance less inspired than both Edward Furlong and Nick Stahl. He's not exactly second-rate, just rather pedestrian. It doesn't help that the only range the screenplay affords is that of volume. Neither does the fact that the piece can't decide who it wants the protagonist to be. It starts out as, of course, series regular John Connor but it then shifts to a new character, Marcus, whose true nature is at the heart of the thing's only real theming. By the finale, the movie is so thoroughly confused as to who the 'hero' is supposed to be that no-one really emerges on top. Look, the feature isn't terrible. It begins to explore some interesting ideas, is decently directed and has a few enjoyable action scenes. It's just incredibly uninteresting, generally, and lacks any real drive, to boot. It's not a bad idea for an extension to the franchise, but it's a relatively poorly executed one. 5/10"

Five years after I made the bad decision to buy this movie new on DVD, I watched it again. You can guess it is a cheap movie when the settings are mostly very dark and show little except destruction. Now I know that Christian Bale can act as I enjoyed his performances in Treasure Island and 3:10 To Yuma but I despise every Batman movie. It is my opinion that Christian Bale did NO acting in Terminator Salvation and I think there was very limited acting in Terminator Salvation. My favorite two performances in Terminator Salvation are by Moon Bloodgood as Blair Williams and Jadagrace as Star. I forced myself to watch the entire movie. Well, that will be the last time. I totally disagree with the way the plot is written. This movie makes John Connor look like some total failure of a person who couldn't lead a cockroach. Sam Worthington gives a bit better performance as Marcus Wright the executed man who comes back as a man-machine. But this performance is still fractured.

Sam Worthington gets the role very nice and he is a delight to watch, hot hot, but Christian Bale is like the comic version of all Terminators until now, I think for a parody he would have been a good choice but for this part it was a rather weak choice. I tell you when he says ""I'll be back "" you cant stop laughing. Its like awkward, so out of place that it takes all the serious action that was happening until then out of your mind and makes it comedy like.<br/><br/>Watching this I can tell that The one from 84 and 91 there are Oscar material, the rest are just shallow copies. But thank God that at least this movie had Sam W and Christian Bale they saved the movie just for being present cos the roles and the action are just so weak. I think Sam W is thinking watching this movie ""what the heck was I thinking?"".<br/><br/>Another tip, hold one for the first hour cos i was close to stop and go to sleep but I kept hoping that Sam W aka MArcus will kiss the girl. That basically kept me going. :) And again, John Connor, oh my god, do robots with their high IQ really die to defend him??? he's like totally useless, you do more stuff and get things happen when the robots intervene. <br/><br/>So I give the movie a 3, but because Bale and Sam are there I give it a 4. :)"

","With the thunderous premiere of Terminator 5 two years ago, I decided to embark on a summer sit-down action, temporary trips and murderous robots.<br/><br/>Watching the five films, I proceed to issue a verdict on this saga: it is definitely dead in the strictly artistic speaking. Without its original creator (James Cameron) each new entry has been digging a pit even deeper. And right now it's a franchise prostituted to the extreme. Even Cameron himself had to resort to Terminator 2 to save his ass against the failure of ""Abyss"" (1989).<br/><br/>Terminator Salvation is not a bad movie, in fact. Has very well focused parts and overwhelming scenes. It only has one glue ... That has nothing to do with the atmosphere and tone of the first two deliveries. There is too much light here, the T-600 is in short supply, and the massive battles between humans and cyborgs, (as in the flashbacks of the first and second films) are of cardboard: too much light for a postapocalyptic story. It ends up being a kind of western mixed with Matrix, War of the Worlds and Transformers. Desert, desert and more desert. Nothing of cities annihilated with tons of skeletons and gigantic machines lurking the battlefield to the few humans who dare to face them.<br/><br/>This film was conceived to finish to throw to a lousy actor, (Sam Worthington) and to give bait to a Christian Bale that does not strike like John Connor. In itself, this movie is not Terminator. If it was conceived as an independent film and with its own personality, I would consider it a good movie. But Terminator only has the title. The BSO, composed by Danny Elfman is horrible, nothing to do with the Brad Friedel classic.<br/><br/>In short, a pity. It will remain as a rarity more within the Frankenstein that is in itself the whole saga.<br/><br/>-Terminator 1: the best of all. With few means, an immediate classic was achieved. -Terminator 2: Great movie, superlative level but below the first delivery. -Teminator 3: Gar-bage. It brings nothing and is a decaffeinated reheat of the second delivery. -Terminator 4: Is this Terminator? -Terminator 5: for some abhorrent, for others, without being a wonder at least retrieved something from the original Temrinator."

As a thrill ride, Terminator Salvation delivers, with awesome spectacle and intense action, as well as some nice narrative tie-ins to the original trilogy (I especially liked young Kyle Reese). It effectively captures the post-apocalyptic world hinted at in the original three. That said, I feel that the Director's cut, said to contain 20 minutes of cut material, will do much to flesh out the story and characters and give the film more of the emotional weight that gave James Cameron's first two films such surprising punch.<br/><br/>Christian Bale effectively makes an awesome G.I. Joe, but the character of John Conner has such dramatic potential that it's sad to see him so underwritten here. Bale is more than equal to the task as an actor if given the screenplay (forget Batman, if you want to see this man really act, watch his incredibly nuanced performance as the meek and humble rancher of quiet integrity in 3:10 to Yuma).

There were no cooldudes here.<br/><br/>The story sure can pass as something interesting, but the fact most people didn't see it because Arnold wasn't in it proves that it sucks still nonetheless. I'm not going to lie, you will be actually kind of drawn in when you sit there and watch it. If you can follow it. But without Schwarzenegger, it isn't a story.

Kyle Reese looked like a pansy, John Connor is more annoying than anything (and no, I'm not hating Christian Bale for his anger episode with that camera guy that was leaked on the net, this is separate) because he behaves too much like a 2010 ""policeman"" who thinks hes in CSI or Law and Order.

","Set in 2018, this fourth film in the 'Terminator' franchise takes place entirely in the post-apocalyptic future as only ever talked about in the previous three installments. The plot has John Connor trying to finally find Kyle Reese (who he is yet to ever meet), while Reese tries to survive on his own, helped out in part by a mysterious stranger, played by Sam Worthington. While the secret behind Worthington's identity is always obvious from the get-go, the film successfully plays on ambiguities as to where his loyalties lie. He also gets some great personality crisis scenes late in the piece. With such a unique and original plot, 'Terminator Salvation' gets full points for not just imitating its predecessors, but through neglecting the formula of the original films, the results are less immersive overall. The film sorely lacks the chase thriller plotting of the earlier movies where everything is about surviving a nonstop killing machine who nobody else believes is really from the future. There are several lulls in the action and without an actor as charismatic as Arnold Schwarzenegger in a key role, the non-action scenes simply lack oomph. The whole muted colour scheme also comes off as a heavyhanded way of showing that the future is miserable, though the heart symbolism at the end takes the cake for lack of subtlety. If not a definite success, 'Salvation' is at least daring different at all times. It is also admittedly interesting to see the war against the machines in action; it is more a case that the war on its own is problematic when it comes to sustaining a feature length film."

There is just somethings you can't do and not having Arnold Schwarzenegger in the Terminator series is one of them<br/><br/>Pretty much the film drive on special effects which are cool and impressive but these days special effects can only go so far when it doesn't have a story or anything else worth noting about this film.<br/><br/>It just a shame that this film has to take something that was always better the way it was but no they had to really damage what made the series a fun one to watch.<br/><br/>The plot is unbelievable pretty much couldn't hold my interest also the acting in this film is off the wall so much of a disappointed that they didn't even make the characters believable and they pick some talented actors for the film<br/><br/>Just not for a fan of the Terminator series and really a disappointed and it felt like they insulted the history of the Terminator <br/><br/>I give Terminator Salvation an 2 out of 10"

","If this were a stand alone movie, it wouldn't be that bad. The problem is it isn't, it is a movie that attempts to pick up the mantle of the Terminator series and carry it forward. The problem is the movie is attempting to change the very essence of the franchise mid-stream.<br/><br/>The original Terminator film came out in 1984, at a time when Hollywood was suspicious of science and progress. E.T. was released the same year and science was hardly a friend of our little buddy in that film.<br/><br/>The premise was simple, mankind eventually creates a sophisticated AI that ultimately turns on us. It represented the best of Sci-Fi storytelling and it continued through the blockbuster T2 and the palatable wrap-up of the pre-Skynet phase of storytelling in T3.<br/><br/>To reprise the series post-Skynet should have been a slam dunk. John Connor is no longer the future commaneder, he is in command, and is taking the fight to the machines.<br/><br/>However, for some inexplicable reason, most of this film is spent not carrying forward the story, but completely changing the tenor of it, hard to do 4 films into a franchise.<br/><br/>So this movie is about a mostly machine, yet still human cyborg walking the earth for no apparent reason. I guess he is supposed to represent the glory that can come about when man and technology are married together. Of course that idea is the complete antithesis of the message of the early Terminator films.<br/><br/>Our cyborg quickly finds he is a target of the machines and also a target of the humans. Yet he redeems himself by using his machine self to rescue John Connor by rescuing his future father and John Connor. In other words, the machine becomes the hero. <br/><br/>You could argue this was the same thing that happened in T2 when Arnold comes back as a good Terminator to protect John. However, there was clear human intervention to make that Terminator good AI.<br/><br/>We are left in the dark through this entire movie as to what the intent of the scientist (played by Helen Bonham Carter) was in creating this cyborg. <br/><br/>So at the end, the machine is the hero, the machine saved John Connor, and it is a story of the redemption of a single machine amidst a war being raged against humanity by all other machines.<br/><br/>So in short, it makes no sense, and because of that performed poorly at the box office and likely denied Terminator fans a conclusive 5th film in the franchise showing the ultimate victory for humanity.<br/><br/>So best of luck rebooting this series as anyone under 30 likely has no idea what it is supposed to be about any more."

","I never wanted another Terminator movie after the disappointing 'Rise of the Machines'. It would have needed great directorial and writing skills to make the story of a protector and terminator sent back in time entertaining to watch again. But unlike anything like that the premise of this one is interesting, set in 2018 after events of Judgement Day with an ongoing Man vs Machine war. When I saw name of Christian Bale in the cast I got excited. The movies opening credits are similar to the original 'The Terminator' with an upgraded version of the original theme with solid sound effects, wow more excitement. But alas! All this excitement gets washed down so badly between the opening and closing credits.<br/><br/>Okay firstly film is barely focused, I didn't not understand what was the ultimate goal it was trying to achieve. Sam Worthington's character Marcus was very enigmatic and just doesn't fit into the Terminator universe already established by the first 3 films. With almost whole story centered around the great leader 'John Connor' speculated in the franchise is barely given such greatness. Christian Bale was tries his best with John Connor, the character the script fails to put in spotlight. Even though this John was more leader-like than Nick Stahl's in T3 still his actions had lack of motivation. It was all pale and boring. The post apocalyptic environment created is nice but it falls short on the fearful touch. I know the T-800s were not created yet but come'on there was a lack of terrifying bad-ass terminator. The HKs weren't quite dreadful and I don't know from where suddenly a that huge Transformer like robot came out of nowhere. The moto-terminators were cool though. Also the first half where Marcus meets up with Kyle Reese felt like just existed to induce some action and so that later Marcus can tell Connor later that he had met Kyle Reese. At least Terminator 3 had some cheesy humor and thrilling chases but there were no laughs here. Yes, its post-apocalyptic setting that doesn't mean the humans don't loosen up a bit. The legendary 'I'll Back' statement gets another go and my god it felt so forced. Arnold not being cast is acceptable considering the premise of the film, but the usage CGI Arnold instead of what could have been a nice special appearance was simply pathetic and cringe-worthy.<br/><br/>Okay, the movie gets many things wrong still it was a honest attempt with the post-apocalyptic setting and plot instead of recycling the same time-traveling terminator chase plot. The sound effects were really great if not original. Also same goes to CGI. Technically it is much better than T3. The duo of Kyle Reese and Star was really lovable but unfortunately gets very less screen- time. The movie has lot explosions and boom blast action. Despite all that the story is not very bad as the recent Transformer movies, if they had involved Kyle Resse a bit more it would have been very nice.Terminator Salvation can be considered as a flawed spin-off try.<br/><br/>RATING: [2/5]"

","Sadly after spending a few months really anticipating the release of this movie, I give it kudos for trying something different. But ultimately condemn it for lacking the charm, or aesthetic look of it's previous titles.<br/><br/>I give praise to Sam Worthington for giving us a half-formed character, even though he comes off a bit forced there's definitely a likability to be had. But Christian Bale's John Connor dialogue makes him come off as an utter meat head, that means a waste of talent from a very renowned actor. Taunting us with both a CGI Arnold (Ok my face lit up at that scene), and the horrible demise of Brad Fiedel's solid ""Terminator"" theme. It's clear that giving the Terminator franchise to ""McG"" (""Charlie's Angels""), was clearly not the direction for the franchise to go in.<br/><br/>Final Verdict: It's visuals are distinctive, though it sets itself apart from previous outings. The Terminator franchise is built upon these aspects, and draw us in considerably well for a series that has done nothing but follow the same formula since it's conception back in 1984. Sadly there is no salvation here. 3/10.<br/><br/>Duh Duh duh duh duh, Duh Duh duh duh duh."

","""Im open to all those things, if its True Lies, Terminator, a well-made Terminator the last one was awful. It tried hard, not that they didn't try, the acting and everything. It missed the boat."" – Arnold Schwarzenegger on Terminator 4.<br/><br/>This review contains spoilers (if that's even possible)<br/><br/>First of all, who the heck is McG? No one knows. He directs TV series, and one other movie. McG itself sounds like a terminator. At what point did the film makers look at his filmography and decide ""Yes. Yes, this is the man we need to direct a movie as important as Terminator 4″?<br/><br/>If you are a die-hard Terminator fan, watch this movie expecting to be disappointed you will still be disappointed.<br/><br/>I've seen all of the terminator movies. The original was fantastic, and the second only expanded on the brilliance of the first. T3 was pretty damn poor but no where near as crap as this installment.<br/><br/>The atmosphere that James Cameron and Stan Winston had created for the first 2 films in the franchise was really cool. I think that was the key component along with consistency and approach that gave the Terminator film it's unique style and attractiveness. It's metallic-blue overlay, infused with creepy whines of music and heart pounding edge of your seat suspense was what really created this secondary reality if not for only an hour long. It made us have a connection to these characters. A sense of believability in what was really going on. But it was those elements that were able to harness the inner workings of this dark dreamland. In essence the first two Terminators were projected nightmares in a sense, as if you were running and running, but no how fast you ran, the shadowy figure on your toes just keeps closing in. THAT is what made those films so captivating.<br/><br/>Within 10 minutes of the title shot, this movie fired off one of THE BIGGEST Clichés IN WESTERN FILM. ""It's too quiet in here (dramatic pause) It's like they're waiting for us"" Seriously now! Is this the best writing that Hollywood can come up with? If this was an attempt at humour it failed just like the rest of this movie.<br/><br/>Giant Robots!!! Loud noises!!! Almost all of the battle sequences in this movie played out like a stylized ripoff of Transformers. There were big walking robots, big robot sound effects, big robot guns and aircraft, big robots riding the robot aircraft, motorcycle robots, robots that launched other robots from their feet They even had little stabby robots that swam around in the water. And they all looked like something out of a cheesy mecha flick. All glossy and pointy looking. These are not the cold, machined gun metal designs that set this series apart from all the others. The dark, nightmare vision from the future in T1 and 2 is nowhere to be seen; it's been replaced by some dumpy-looking CGI plain landscape.<br/><br/>The informative and useful character development that occurred in the first two films have been replaced by chase scenes in order to show how 'cool' our heroes are. Because of this, we end up carring about none of them. Even John Coner. He's just so dull. The dialouge is terrible. So terrible, in fact, that it becomes funny. At one point in the movie our human/terminator hybrid hero turns on a caset or something that plays some cheesy music ( that coincidently just so happens to be the same music that Marcus' late brother likes) to which Kyle Reese asks ""What's that?"" He is never told, but five minutes later refers to the mysterious phenomenon as music. There's also an exeptionally cringeworthy camp fire scene that I can't be bothered to trash. This is just a minor plot hole compared to numerous others. I mean, why couldn't Skynet just kill Reese instead of engaging in an overly complicated plan to use him to lure Conner INTO THEIR BASE so that they can unlease a naked CGI Arnie (which was a real slap in the face for fans), who just happens to be a new brand of ""Throwanators"". These machines, rather than crush puny humans in an instant, decide to throw them around the place. These are nothing compared to the bandana-wearing, trigger-happy Fattynators, who take pride in shooting their own feet."

","The whole thing is an uninspired mess and makes for a very poor 25th anniversary present for ""Terminator"" fans. McG is just not a good director. Arnold Schwarzenegger's absence leaves a void that isn't filled. As I said in my ""Terminator 2"" review, he isn't a very good actor but he still makes for an entertaining one in his own way. Plus his deficiencies were more than made up for by the strong supporting cast, particularly in the first two films. In contrast, the cast of this film is generally rather poor. Christian Bale's ""shout acting"" is not just bad but very irritating and really quite laughable and his ""badass"" voice isn't much better. Sam Huntington, Bryce Dallas Howard, Moon Bloodgood and Common are all either bad or make no impression whatsoever. Anton Yelchin - who actually bears a passing resemblance to Michael Biehn - is better but not by much. None of the characters really have any personalities. As in the marginally better ""Planet of the Apes"" (2001), the strongest cast member is Helena Bonham Carter but she's in it for all of five minutes. Michael Ironside and Jane Alexander deserved more screen time as well. I really appreciated Linda Hamilton's voice only cameo as Sarah. However, I think that they missed a trick in not bringing back Earl Boen, the only actor besides Arnie to appear in all of the first three films, as Dr. Silberman.<br/><br/>Again like ""Planet of the Apes"" (2001), the script had some interesting ideas - Skynet being aware of John Connor and Kyle Reese's importance due to the influence of its own time travelling Terminators from the future, John finally meeting his much younger father, Marcus not realising that he is a hybrid and Skynet taking on a human face to communicate with him - but it seemed like a first draft rather than the finished product. I quite liked the idea of linking into the original film but it wasn't very well executed. I felt that it was the sort of thing that would have been better dealt with it in a tie-in novel or comic book rather than in a film 25 years after the fact. Continuity can sometimes be a double-edged sword in that respect as you don't want to remind people of better films when they're watching your bad one. The fight with the T-800 prototype and Arnie's ""digital cameo"" was definitely my favourite part of the film but even that's not great. <br/><br/>In spite of my many problems with this film, I'm still looking forward to the fifth one ""Terminator: Genisys"" (in spite of its stupid title) as it seems to be taking a ""back to basics"" approach with Arnie back in the saddle and, seemingly, the return of time travel to the series with the casting of the 27-year-old Emilia Clarke as Sarah."

To add to this the film has no resolution, conveniently leaving the franchise open to expansion. I am actually OK with giving the film 1 star. The only saving grace if it can be called such is the acting of Sam Worthington as Frankenstein's Robot! He puts in a solid performance which in no way is enough to save this disastrous catastrophe.<br/><br/>I loved The Terminator, LOVED T2, Tolerated T3 despite its many short comings but T4 lost the plot, figuratively and literally.<br/><br/>Not Worth watching."
"JoeP123","7","0","1","8 March 2014"," A ""modern"" version of about 10 minutes of film.
","Terminator Salvation is at least, in its simplest sense, an interesting film, and one that is certainly, and very, watchable. It is created from, in a tonal sense, about 10-15 minutes of footage from the classic original Terminator. That is all the viewers of the Terminator films (not the series which I never viewed) have really seen of the war in the future. It was dark, bleak, only really seen at night and consisted of a feeble human race fighting against a larger robot race. Yet, Terminator Salvation is a film that is set entirely in this world. And it is an amazing world to behold. If the entire review was just about the world shown - or hell, just about the experience of watching it, then this film would be an instant classic. It changes up the world seen previously, yet portrays it, in a way, exactly how Terminator explained it to be - hell. But we can't just look at it by the world, we have to sum it by all of its parts. And some are pretty faulty. For example, it was written by the writers of the excellent David Fincher movie ""The Game"". They also wrote the not so excellent ""Catwoman"". Yeah. The story is good, but leaves a huge amount to be desired. The acting is good, but just good. Not excellent. People talk, and are believable, but only just believable enough to pass. The set pieces are pretty incredible at points, and provide some good, tense action. Plus, the film itself is super entertaining on a basic brain-switching-off level. It has many good points, and a few bad. It isn't perfect, but lets be fair, it wasn't meant to be. Hell, the guy's name is ""McG"". He wasn't here to make a statement about life and machines and what makes us human or any of that, and if he was, that was a failure. He was here to entertain and man oh man did he get that right. If you're stubborn and cannot flex your views on Terminator and what you think it ""should"" be based on the first two amazing movies, then you won't like this movie. But you knew that. But if you go in with an open mind, then maybe, just maybe, you might even enjoy yourself."

","Terminator fans has been doubting director McG into directing the latest Terminator film, where the focus of the film this time isn't really about the Terminators much although there were a hell bunch of them out there. The focus is more on the human race. Their struggle of winning the war. Purpose to live and exist. Director McG has never direct anything serious so far.<br/><br/>Well, this time he proves what's best and he's capable of doing to please the audiences and fans. Bale as John Connor reminds me of his role in 3:10 to Yuma where he acts alongside Russell Crowe. But Bale's portrayal in this film with Sam Worthington as Marcus Wright is a little awkward when I saw Marcus being held captive and still believes he's human; that is when John Connor's interrogation having that Batman's voice in Dark Knight with Joker.<br/><br/>Anton Yelchin as the young Kyle Reese; this Reese has the every knowledge of being taught by Marcus Wright where we will recall some parts being shown in The Terminator. The part where Marcus tight a rope around the rifle was shown in the first Terminator film when he battle the T-800 to protect Sarah Connor. Yelchin delivers the character very interesting and there are still a little comedy in him. Perhaps Reese was still a teenager.<br/><br/>Then there's this scene where the Hydrobots jumps onto Connor's face as it wriggles to kill him. Don't you think it's one of James Cameron's cameo item? Doesn't it reminds you of face-hugger in Aliens?"

","Terminator Salvation is my second favorite movie of this series. I like it because it actually tells the story of the war between humans and machines, or at least a little part of that war. However, I was a little upset that John Connor (Christian Bale) was not the leader of the human resistance, just a unit leader, but by the end of this installment that will be rectified.<br/><br/>The special effects and graphics are very good. The fight scenes are pretty awesome. The script and plot are very good. I like that the scars on John Connor's face we have come to see on all the actors who have played him are explained.<br/><br/>According to IMDb.com fans have given Terminator Salvation an average score of 6.7 stars. I actually give Terminator Salvation 9 stars, I couldn't wait for the war between humans and machines to be depicted. That is why this is my second favorite of these movies. Perhaps the scores have been so low because time-travel wasn't a part of the script, or was it? How did Marcus Wright (Sam Worthington) die in 2003 and wake up in 2018?<br/><br/>There are many great scenes in this movie that I liked, however, I will only describe three (as usual).<br/><br/>My first favorite scene is when Marcus meets Kyle Reese (Anton Yelchin) and Star (Jadagrace). It's a little sparse as far as action or speaking go, but it is the first time we see Kyle as a teenager. And really it is the first time we have seen this character since the first movie. Although, there was a scene in T2 that didn't make it to the theatrical version where Kyle comes to Sarah in a dream.<br/><br/>The next favorite scene is when Marcus escapes from John Connor's resistance compound. He is helped by Blair Williams (Moon Bloodgood). He has to escape in order to rescue Star and Kyle, but really he has to escape because it has been discovered that he is a Cyborg. But he is not like the Terminators we have come to know. Marcus has a human mind and heart, but everything else is robotic. John Connor goes against everything he believes in in order to save his father, Kyle; John lets Marcus go hoping that Marcus can help save Kyle.<br/><br/>The last favorite scene is when Marcus gives John his heart. Marcus had been a convicted murderer in 2003, and was sentenced to death by lethal injection; which was carried out. However, he was revived by CRS aka Skynet, to infiltrate the resistance. But, Marcus redeems himself, both as a human and a machine by giving John his heart. I believe this is where the salvation comes in. Marcus is the salvation of everything; he helps save Kyle, he helps save John, and he ultimately helps save the resistance.<br/><br/>I almost forgot. Kate Connor (nee Brewster) is played by Bryce Dallas Howard. Bryce is Ron Howard's daughter. I think this was a great casting choice. I have liked everything that I have seen her in. It doesn't hurt that she is a redhead, which is my favorite hair color. Or, more accurately, she is usually a redhead.<br/><br/>These are my thoughts on this damn good movie. What do you think?"
"gabthum-1","6","0","3","16 July 2013"," Slightly better than ""Terminator 3"", but that's not saying much.
","I have mixed feelings after watching ""Terminator Salvation"". Well, I do enjoy the movie, but overall it feels very different when compared to James Cameron's modern classics.<br/><br/>The movie features more robots and bigger explosions than the previous installments. I am very impressed with the action scenes as they are very well done. The movie uses a lot of practical effects instead of CGI, and this makes the action feel more realistic. I'm also glad that the movie features cameo appearances by Linda Hamilton's voice and Arnold Schwarzenegger's face as references to the previous installments.<br/><br/>However, I am a little disappointed that the story focuses more on Marcus Wright instead of John Connor. The movie does not explore how Connor evolves into the saviour of mankind and why his men are so loyal to him. Instead, the movie shows how Wright, a death row inmate, is given a second chance to redeem himself. Geez!<br/><br/>IMHO, the Terminator saga ended with the conclusion of ""Terminator 2"", but Hollywood just had to milk the cow dry. As much as I am impressed with the production designs and action scenes, ""Terminator Salvation"" is just not as good as the first two installments. However, it is slightly better than ""Terminator 3: Rise Of The Machines"", but that's not saying much."
"antonjsw1","8","0","1","14 July 2013"," Very enjoyable and respectful sequel marred by a rushed ending
","McG continues to show maturation as a director, with a very worthy follow up to his excellent We Are Marshall drama. Terminator Salvation is an excellent entry in the series. While still not on a level of the seminal Terminator, it is right up there with T2, and on many levels is more entertaining and interesting than the very good T3. However, like T2, and unlike T3 and the original Terminator, a really good film is marred by overtly abrupt and unsatisfying ending, that Salvation's case misses a great opportunity to do something really bold and daring with the film's coda, and instead comes out as a rushed cop-out due to the producers' aversion to trying something truly original. <br/><br/>Having said that, the film opens at a real clip, and the film never flags pace wise (a failing of the middle of T2) but with a wider span of characters in this story compared with previous outings, some characters have relatively little time to establish themselves in the fast moving plot. Bale is, as usual good value, and plays his character well in a surprisingly understated manner. However, it is interesting that the character's aversion to authority comes across well in this film, something seen throughout both T2 and T3. In fact, the casting of Bale is a better choice than Nick Stahl from the previous film. Other characters give good value in nothing more than glorified cameo's are Michael Ironside, Common and Bryce Dallas Howard. Helen Bonham Carter is very good in an interesting and pivotal, if brief role. However the most interesting characters in this film are Moon Bloodgood's Blair Williams, an idealistic pilot; Anton Yelchin in great form as a young Kyle Reese, and Sam Worthington, who steals the show as the mysterious Marcus Wright. These three characters are the best in the film as they come across as the most human and emotional characters, and I found me being drawn to them more than other performances. <br/><br/>The overall story is quite clever and interesting, and plays very well on the audience's prior knowledge of the story. The Marcus Wright character, whose actual identity can be deduced by the audience fairly quickly, is nevertheless a compelling character and is fabulously well realised by Sam Worthington (one can see why James Cameron and Russell Crowe recommended him to director McG) as the character tries to make sense of what is going on around him. In fact, the character's behaviour draws an interesting parallel with the Sarah Connor/Terminator character development from T2. While Sarah Connors character is trying to become ruthless and driven like a Terminator, the Terminator itself is on a journey of learning what it is to be human. Marcus Wright clearly has a streak of humanity in him, and is driven by a need for redemption through trying to locate Kyle Reese and Star (a mute companion to Kyle Reese well played by youngster Jadagrace). His humanity and this drive for redemption and caring for humanity's fate strengthens during the film, and is an interesting contrast with the more unemotional, single-minded , logical and world weary demeanour of Bale's Connor. <br/><br/>Unfortunately the downside of the plot is, like T2 a rushed and contrived ending. While the action climax at the end of the film is exciting and entirely appropriate, the film's coda missed a fantastic opportunity to do something really bold and daring. In my view, the John Connor character should have had a more terminal fate, and that what would have been really interesting would be for Marcus Wright to have, in some way, taken on the identity/role of John Connor, and this would have made an interesting 'second chance' for the Wright character. It would certainly have allowed the film to go in an interesting direction, as the actual ending is, in my view, a cop-out to conventionalism. This mars what was up to that point a terrific film. In terms of the look of the film, director McG goes for a 'Mad Max' type dystopia, which is a refreshing look for this franchise and works well. Shane Hurlbut, who had worked with McG on We Are Marshall, gives the film a stylish and slightly washed out look, and certainly the action scenes are very well handled, with a good balance between high quality ILM digital effects, and in-camera animatronics and special effects by the Stan Winston Studio and Kerner Optical. Martin Laing's production design in first rate, as is long time James Cameron and Oscar Winning editing by Conrad Buff. Danny Elfman's score is highly effective and creates an impressive mood. McG marshals everything with style and panache, and the film zips by brilliantly up until the final coda, when it falls slightly apart in having this rushed and boring ending.<br/><br/>In summary, an excellent science fiction film that falls just short of greatness down to a rushed and unsatisfying ending."

","Despite all the critique this movie gets, there is very little wrong with it. The action is fun and the story line is interesting for the two hours you invest in it. It is well directed and casted although the story builds mostly around the character of Marcus Wright and not one of John Connor. McG does a good job at keeping this film separate enough from the original T1-T2 story arc, although the new pale grungy colour scheme might not satisfy all of the movie goers. The only real gripe I share with other critics is that it is not Terminator 2. Whereas T1 & T2 are an undeniable classic that I watched over a dozen of times, Terminator Salvation will not blow your mind, but you will have a good time watching it."

","Folks, the fan boys were wrong.<br/><br/>First, different director. FYI, Cameron was dragged into the second one by Arnie and co, and don't even bring up the third installment. So really, you can only hold James Cameron responsible for the first entry into the series. Don't believe me, read the articles on how many times the rights have changed companies for this series, and what they originally sold for! That being said, if I didn't recognize McG's proficiency as a directer, I do now.<br/><br/>The tone and setting of the movie are grainy, beige, post-apocalyptic, dystopian world after Judgement Day. Judgement Day has occurred, but on a different time frame thanks to the previous events of the past movies changing the course of history. This time, we see the world as it would be after those events, including the persecution and enslavement of humanity by the entity known as Skynet. Characters in the film reflect this world, wearing clothes from consignment, military garb, etc. T models, HKs, along with a slew of new robotic baddies, and even the famed T-600s make their way into the film, all thanks to the creative mind and final entry of the historically significant Stan Winston, appearing in probably his last cameo before his passing. And all those robots look as bad-ass as anything else Stan's development team has come up with. While the film may not have the same blue hue that Terminator and T2 had, it definitely has it's own saturation and faded feel to it.<br/><br/>Sound is straight Terminator. Danny Elfman is back, including the five notes everybody remembers. This time, terminators make clenching sound when turning and moving, something distinct and unfortunately not reproducible in text for a review. Explosions, lows, and metal clashes sound like they should. Between Bale and Worthington there's plenty of screaming to get your inner aggro on; I think the development team's talent recruitment purposefully selected these two for yelling beyond their recommendations from directors. All in all, it sounds like the franchise should.<br/><br/>Talent in this movie is big. Even without Arnold's on-screen presence, there's enough drama and nuance delivered by the main cast to keep people in-thralled. Even Jadagrace grows on you, in-sort of a Newt-esque style, despite delivering no dialog. (If you don't know who the ""Newt"" is I'm referring to, go watch some movies.) Sam and Christian keep things very manly and in constant control over their respective situations, even during conflict between each other. The new girls to the series, Moon Bloodgood and Bryce Dallas Howard, are both dramatic and very hot. The chemistry between Sam and Moon is especially hot, and it's a shame they didn't deliver a little more relationship time between the two. Common makes for a solid sidekick, but sadly this installment follows Hollywood's formula for sticking black men in second, or just straight killing them off early, *SPOILER* as is the case for Terry Crews, who we see dead for three seconds in the first eight minutes of the film. *END SPOILER* (If that ruined or spoiled anything for you, your an idiot.) Lastly, Anton Yelchin could be a dead ringer for Micheal Beihn in the near future. Not only did he nail Kyle Reese's mannerisms from the first film, a combination of the make-up department and genetics made him look exactly how a younger Micheal Beihn would have looked. Linda Hamilton returns for an uncredited voice over.<br/><br/>The plot is all over the place, and for good reason. We don't know what's going on until towards the middle and end of the movie, even though there's plenty of throwback's, familiar narrative, and plot devices to allude to what's really happening. That's all I can say without ruining things for people who haven't watched yet. Like all installments of the franchise, the characters are either traveling to a destination for an operative, or in hot pursuit by (a) terminator(s). The fundamental why is answered later on. Pacing is solid, we have high and low intensity moments all through out. At no time will you watch the clock, I promise you. I did of course watch the Director's Cut, which does have several more moments of glorious near R-rated cinematography. Live action sequences are fairly long and well spliced together, during a particular sequence, the cameramen had to chase after Moon and Sam for several minutes under stunt fire! Or so it seems from the superb cut job. There is no longer a mother son, nor father son relationship between characters. Instead we get heterosexual lover and bromance dramas popping up.<br/><br/>Now, pundits against this movie are idiots. Minor canonical imperfections aside, this entry gave us something old and a lot more new. Throwbacks are all over the place, from lines, to stunts, to events, to returning actors, characters, and even creators. Remember this movie went through over five re-writes before it was shot, and the rights to the series have been sold more times than provinces in South Africa. Even after all that, Sam Worthington was recommended by Cameron when contacted by McG, Stan Winston came back to make more movie magic, Danny Elfman returned for the score, Linda Hamilton for the sheer iconic flair, and even another unmentioned actor found their way into production. The T-600s and 800s look impressive, and despite one intentionally shooting it's foot, they come off menacing. All the other baddies deliver quick dosages of wanton carnage at the blink of an eye, reinforcing the ""kill or be killed"" attitude of the series. Even the climaxes of battles, while being very much throwback driven, have awesome and unpredictable outcomes. The angst against this movie is purely nostalgia driven, and nothing more. I also loved the first movie, and had every toy from the line-up when T2 came out back in 1991.<br/><br/>Superb flick, and I'd recommend it if you haven't seen or rented it yet."
"Al_The_Strange","8","0","2","4 February 2013"," ""What is it that makes us human?""
","The first two Terminator films hinted at the frightening post-nuclear-war future, overrun by SkyNet and its army of machines. Terminator 3 showed how it came to pass. Finally, in 2009, Terminator: Salvation would be the first film to show the actual future wars of the franchise in full.<br/><br/>To be frank, my first impression was not the best. I took issue with Christian Bale's aggressive take on John Connor, and the film's focus on Marcus Wright (Sam Worthington) as the main character. To say nothing of the actual plot, which seems like a mad rush to slap John, Marcus, and Kyle Reese together, just because destiny says they have to.<br/><br/>On repeat viewings, I learned to accept the film as it is. This is still an action-driven film, and the action does not disappoint. It does a decent job of showing planes and soldiers clashing with SkyNet's terminators, Goliaths, and hunter-killers in some modestly epic war scenes. The chase scene between the tow truck, the giant terminator, the motorbike terminators, and the giant HK is a thrilling piece of work. The final confrontations in the SkyNet factory are pretty cool. The pacing is high most of the time, and the film overall is appropriately gritty, dark, and intense.<br/><br/>The story doesn't really progress the franchise much, aside from uniting the characters we know and love together, and showing a little more insight on the future war. Its biggest contribution is in introducing Marcus as a character, who comes to represent a larger theme that puts the movie into a thrilling new context: the film overall asks the question, what does it mean to be human? Through a series of dramatic twists, the film reaches a decently profound conclusion.<br/><br/>The film looks good, with solid photography and quality editing. There are a lot of great looking shots throughout. Acting is not bad at all: even though I found it hard to accept Christian Bale's performance as John Connor (thanks largely to Bale's supposed outburst during the film's shooting, and his previous portrayal as Batman), I realized that he is doing his best to match up with Edward Furlong's character in T2, and he does so with an appropriate level of nuance and aggression. Sam Worthington is surprisingly excellent in his role. Anton Yelchin is not bad as Kyle Reese, but could have used more scenes. Writing overall is pretty good. This production has decent sets, props, costumes, and special effects. Music is good.<br/><br/>I'd recommend this as a rental.<br/><br/>4/5 (Entertainment: Good | Story: Good | Film: Good)"

","Good movie, but this film ain't gonna save Terminator franchise.<br/><br/>I think sometimes Hollywood and the directors are so worried about make something than they never be worried if they most do it! Whoever Salvation is a good movie, good action, nice cast (not the better, not the worst), Chritian Bale make a good roll as Connor, And some parts than are really nice, like a taco, but still have many bad and illogical parts. Is a better movie than the third, but is far far away to be a classic like the first two. Anyway there something disturbing me, as i say the movie is not good enough for make we have the certainly that the the next part of terminator gonna be a really good movie because no nobody knows nothing about the way terminator gonna take."
"Death-2-trolls","6","0","1","7 December 2011"," Not bad, but nothing new
","We all know Terminator, with Arnold there is nothing short of action, explosions, and shotguns. In each of the beginning intro of the first three terminator movies, we get to see a little action from the future war where the future is bleak and dark. Now with the fourth Terminator, we get to see that, but does it have the Cameron touch to it? I have to say the movie isn't that bad, but machines that we see such as the Hunter killer tanks and jets are not of the design of what we would come to expect. I'm surprised they didn't used any of those terminator designs from the technical books that we see in the comic stores.<br/><br/>Acting the part, I'm expecting none of the actors from the first three terminator movies will be doing any parts. Arnold does show his face but the face from the 80's movie of his younger self though. Otherwise, acting is fine, just don't expect any Oscar tear jerker.<br/><br/>As for the storyline, well the movie seems to be just a little part of that of the supposedly three trilogy that McG is supposed to offer. However I think most terminator fans will expect too much and this movie offers just a little of the storyline. Was this movie needed? Probably no, but it is fun to watch, but also more to fun to imagine in our heads of how a prequel is suppose to be.<br/><br/>No drama relations in this one like how the second movie was with Sarah Conor and her son. If I were God, the third terminator was not needed and too bad it should have ended that way and make this movie a prequel. Other then that, a good Saturday night movie."
"swedzin","6","0","3","11 September 2011"," One, big roller coaster ride, but not a Terminator...
","By roller coaster ride, I meant - it is very entertaining film. And that's all. But, still it is better than Terminator 3 (2003). While Terminator 3 was presented as one big joke, this film returned him on serious path. Now, finally we got the story in inevitable future, that was cool. We get to see human fighting machines, that was cool. We get to some new things and that was cool. The plot itself is nothing special, now honestly, the entire story is, well, pretty good, but, it could be a lot better. Directed by Joseph McGinty Nichol, or as he was credited as McG, sounds like a gangster rapper to me. He did a fine job, but, I guess the only thing he did was pulling out the Terminator from Terminator 3 parody and just brush it off and release it again to just... simply wander off somewhere. The story is concentrated on John Connor (who is not a leader of the humans yet in this film, which is bad, he was supposed to be a leader, but most of the films are showing these promised heroes and young, dumb, relentless characters that still can't be a leader) played by Christian Bale. Bale did a good job as Connor, good job and he needs to find young Kyle Reese here and save him. A little bit too much I think, when Kyle could be a member of his fighting party already. Now, there's a second leading character Marcus Wright (Sam Worthington) who came into the future to find John Connor... I promise, no more spoiling here. And there it goes... one big ride meant to connect these two characters. Forget that! Give me war! <br/><br/>Other actors as Bryce Dallas Howard, Moon Bloodgood, Helena Bonham Carter, Antoan Yelchin and Common did a good job. Hell, we also had a honor and privilege to see Jane Alexander in a smaller part and Michael Ironside (yeah with his cool voice) as one of the Connor's commanders. And Linda Hamilton's voice. That was cool. Actors were OK. <br/><br/>Now, CGI, special effects, those were good, no complaints and grievances there. We get to see some new machines here, some new Terminator endoskeletons and of course Hydrobots and Motor-Terminators. Motor-Terminators? What's new? Now, that was funny. Also loved Danny Elfman's score.<br/><br/>Overall, nothing special, just on the right path again. Watch it and enjoy."
"c-term-93-814297","9","0","4","29 June 2011"," This Terminator is certainly ""Salvation"",,,
","My favourite franchise was the Terminator series, as a young kid, ""THE TERMINATOR"" and ""T2"" were like my ""Star Wars"" for the new generation. I adored them that much because of some really thoughtful stories fleshed out in the films... And T3? Well, it was very good but it wasn't awesome like the first two, it turned very unsettling when it went too far with the comedic bits,(like Batman Forever for a reason) It really bothered me, most of my enjoyment to the film. Yes, the previous films had a sense of humour but humour that actually makes sense, obviously! T3; nonsensical humour in a bad way. <br/><br/>In 2009, fans have TERMINATOR SALVATION, The new addition to the series. Right now in this review I'm writing, I absolutely love this movie. It was back to the great thoughtful story, the Star Wars vibe I felt with the first movies and Salvation certainly looks amazing, dark and gritty like what the original Terminator had captured on screen. I can certainly understand what people are talking about the gripes of Salvation and I don't agree on most of them. I only agree that Christian Bale's not-so stellar performance could've been better but I forgive him.(My genuine apologies, Mr. Bale)But this film brings true salvation to the Terminator series, nonetheless! This movie is a lot better than T3: Rise of Machines, that is for sure... And it excels tremendously! One of the best films of the franchise so far. Certainly worthy to the original Terminator and T2: Judgment Day... I rate it, a ""9.0"" for being such an absolutely awesome movie!"
"IllusionOfLife","8","0","6","27 June 2011"," Imperfect, but Not Nearly as Bad as People Treat It.
","Terminator Salvation Rating: B <br/><br/>WARNING: Review may contain minor spoilers but I promise not to include anything you can't already see in the trailers. <br/><br/>Terminator Salvation is set in the year 2018 after a computer defense system known as Skynet launched a Nuclear attack on the human race. The humans that survived banded together to form a resistance in the war against the machines, one of these humans is John Connor, the man who in another future led man kind to a great defeat against Skynet and the machines. However in this film he's just another member of the resistance who has to take orders from not as qualified command officers. Also another man by the name of Marcus Wright shows up and has apparently no idea what has happened over the last 14 years, he meets up with Kyle Reese, the guy who ends up going back in time and becoming John Connors father. And without getting into spoilers everything else you need to know is that there are a bunch of robots and explosions. <br/><br/>So I went into Terminator Salvation with fairly high expectations, it was my most anticipated movie of the summer and I didn't want to be let down as I was with last years most- anticipated (Indiana Jones and Lucas' Alien Fetish). With that being said I was overall pleased with the way Salvation turned out. By no means was it an incredible accomplishment or a movie that would redefine Sci-Fi and action movies, but for a summer pop-corn movie it doesn't let you down. There are some great action sequences especially during the second half of the film, and it knows how to have fun without being silly like T3. <br/><br/>On the negative side however, the plot during the first act was trying to accomplish too much. There were two or three separate story threads that we had to follow at any given time and instead of working together it felt like they were competing for screen time. The stories were important to tell but the way they were presented was non-intuitive and slightly frustrating, however when the stories met up during the second act things got much better very quickly. Now they could focus on one plot line and give it all the attention it deserved. Another negative aspect is that many of the performances were very mediocre, especially with Sam Worthington's character struggling with an American accent and at times seemingly forgetting to act. <br/><br/>The effects and the action sequences in this film were great, this is definitely a movie that makes the nerd inside of all of us cheer out in joy. The battle scene with the T-800 is especially amazing. McG definitely knows how to direct a cool action movie, now he just needs to focus on making sure that each story point gets the same treatment, even if that means slimming a few down. <br/><br/>This movie was by no means on par with the ground breaking T2, but it was also a very different type of movie and thus requires a different mind-set going into it. If you expect a smart Sci-Fi action drama on the same level as Judgement Day than you'll be disappointed but if you can enjoy a movie with robots and explosions with a fairly good story to tie it together than you'll enjoy this. Star Trek is still my favorite movie of the year so far, but that being said I was pleased with this movie and I can't wait to see McG improve upon Salvation with the rest of the series."
"KineticSeoul","7","0","3","8 May 2011"," Has it's flaws, but still underrated and is worthy to be part of the ""Terminator"" franchise
","While all the previous movie takes place before the machines takeover and it's mostly all before the nuclear holocaust. This movie takes place during the main war with humans against the machines. The set pieces and design of the scenery is done very well, in fact it's entertaining to just watch the scenery in this which takes place in a apocalyptic land. It basically looks like a future war zone so it fits the plot almost perfectly. Although Christian Bale got made fun of because of his sort of Batman like voice, overall he did a great job playing the role of John Connor. He fit the role of the leader of the resistance and fit the image as well. Plus it was cool to see John Connor's potential the previous movies in this franchise kept talking about. Sam Worthington was just okay, I guess. The cameo appearance is meant to shock the audience and probably wanted the a applause out of them, because it's a scene for the fans but it just wasn't that effective. The plot also deviates from the previous movies a bit, but that didn't really effect the movie much. Maybe fans of the first two movies might be a bit disappointed with this movie, but overall this is a highly entertaining movie. And got my attention from beginning to end with it's action sequences. The camera work/special effects are top notch in this for 2009 as well. Unlike the previous Terminator movies, this one is mostly about the war in the future with the resistance fighting off the machines for their survival. When it all comes down to it, this is far from being a bad movie. In fact it's worthy to be part of the franchise for the most part. Maybe it can get better if Arnold reprise his role as the main character in the next sequel.<br/><br/>7.7/10"
"rdbrown-zeteo","7","0","1","5 February 2011"," I like it more the more I watch it.
","Before I go anywhere with this review... note that my spoiler warning was just to let you know there may be a spoiler in my review... you may read my review and not find anything spoiled information... or you may.<br/><br/>First of all... I understand all of the negatives towards this movie... it has a few week spots... but they are not too weak for me not to enjoy the movie. It was good... but could have been incredible. John Conner's character seems to fade behind the other guy's character. So basically, characterization could have been better. You get to know the characters... but not well enough to truly feel anything for them, with the exception of Kyle and Story... The ""terminator""s character was well played I think. Also, Kate needed a bigger part. I wish there had been more between conner and Kate's relationship together. Another thing I thought would have been good would have been to include some things depicting the terror that the people face and live through... more attacks from the machines against humans... where the humans actually suffered or witnessed loved ones die as they were able to escape... I wish I had been a part of the scripting party, I would have thrown that idea into the pot. You may not agree with me. IN the movie.. you can see that conner is struggling with something... but not entirely sure as to what that is. What is conflicting him? Well, the death of Kyle Reese, something about trying to find answers from his mother's tapes... etc. His character just isn't as strong in this movie as in the other movies. Next, the last fight scenes with the Arnold T-800. There was something about the older movies where the machine seemed to be more real... in that they were more rigid... and not too CGI. WHen the machines chased Sarah, Kyle, John... etc... around... it was scary, freak'n intense! But in this movie... the CGI made it seem not as real and took away that very factor or being scary. THe machine got tossed around a lot like it was a cardboard box and didn't seem too strong and hard to kill as in the first two movies. <br/><br/>And the last thing was that through-out the whole movie... and even the moments of Conner's mistrust of the ""new terminator"" (I can't remember his name), he apparently forgot about the fact that a Terminator had saved his life several times in the past. There was not mention of it except for at the beginning of the film - and it was not really mentioned. I thought that there needed to be something in conversation or a reflection on the fact that a machine did protect him. <br/><br/>I honestly think they should make another one. At least one that includes and explains in more detail the events leading Conner to sending Kyle into the past to save his mother... only after learning of Skynet's new creation... ""time travel"" and plan to send a machine into the past to kill his mother and ultimately win the war. <br/><br/>If they do, boy... that would be the perfect end to the series... I don't even have to explain why.<br/><br/>Apart from the weak spots. It is a very entertaining movie... the characters are still interesting enough to keep you liking the movie. The action is great. The Effects are very good... and too good at the end fight scene... like I mentioned. But... I own the movie... and I still watch it from time to time. Its not a flop, or a terrible movie. It's just weak in a few places that would have made it an incredible movie!"

","Picking up from the scrap metal inspired dregs of its predecessor, which left a bitter aftertaste, Salvation is grantable of being a vast step up from that. As a 4th instalment though, it is the Indiana Jones of 2009. Not being tragic enough to be a Shakespeare play (like the latter's abysmal finale), or the zesty jumpstart sought after, which at least ditches the shackles of its formulaic overtone that lost its voice after 3.<br/><br/>Migrating the series to the less traditional, but frequently seen apocalypse of 2018 the man vs. machines battle wages on with John Connor (welcomingly replaced by Christian Bale) being the core source of hope, basically replicating the whole Zion affray and Neo worship with several tweaks.<br/><br/>McG has done well for himself, showing he's more than just a fan who wanted to direct (direction in Charlie's Angels = near nought), but someone who understands the origins of the series that were mentioned in 1 and 2, like the Clone Wars were in Star Wars.<br/><br/>Now it seems the laser beams, crumbling architecture and global deterioration have been revamped for a more modern age though still maintaining some of the essence Cameron introduced to the audience briefly in his future depiction. It doesn't produce the unwanted runt of a litter that could have been an Emmerich and Bay combined mishap, but borrows heavily from others and coats 99% of film in CGI; making it as humane as its metal protagonists.<br/><br/>Carpet swept fakeries alike, it suits the film greatly and while it priorities visuals more than script it vastly boosts better all-round performances. If it bartered with emotions more then it might have been the offspring fans hoped for, but Terminator was never about sentiment was it?"
"leplatypus","4","0","3","20 November 2010"," If you can read this, you are among the rebellion (TV)
","Actually, i think this franchise is maybe the only one (with at least 4 movies) that I have seen continuously (From 1 to 4). Unfortunately, it's not the best.<br/><br/>The first Terminator was excellent, the second was good but not original, the third was an unnecessary crap and this final element is better than its predecessor but faraway from the Cameron's movies.<br/><br/>The choice for the future setting is a good (and logic) idea and some sequences are great: the opening battles, the devastated LA, the isolated gas station are really visions that we waited for. On the other hand, the addition of green filter is not welcomed because it's such a lazy trick: Those rebels (and machines) see their world without it thus why can't the audience? <br/><br/>Second, I really like the trip to Skynet, this is to say, inside the ""monster"". For John Connor, it's the most dangerous place in the world but he goes there and he gives us thrills! It's again a good idea to see what the machines do to humans and the built-in line of the T-800 (with a good surprise too!). However, we got again the melting iron background for the battle and that's enough! <br/><br/>Third, the script is hard to understand: I don't remember the previous movies so well to know if we know if John Connor is winning the war after all and above all, how? But here, his only big mission is to meet and save Kyle Reese, his future father. It's a bit disappointing, in so far as, his only help is a human/machine breed who (that) isn't really convincing (Sam Worhthington).<br/><br/>In conclusion, except a few good minutes, the movie isn't the definitive Terminator story. For those who look for it, read the Robocop/Terminator comics by Frank Miller and Simonson because they really understand what those characters means!"

The movie isn't bad, it's watchable. There is good actors. But it also has a lame plot and isn't able to create a good believably story. Because the lame plot ruins its atmosphere. Alas. Many right things have been said by other commentators. I point just one total cliché that is most annoying for me. I'm saying about heart giving thing. The act of sacrifice, that was used in previous series, because of good plot which organic part it was, worked, was true and believable. In this movie it seems completely false, stupid and melodramatic. The authors trying convince us that there is a total war for survival of entire human race. And there is no donor-heart for dying leader (no cadavers, no severely injured in the permanent battle, no wishful donation from disabled man or woman, unfit for active service), except one from the allied cyborg with full human identity who one costs half of the whole resistance? And they dump him just for heart? Are you kidding? Or it's morally OK for director and the main auditory because he has too much artificial implants and couldn't be considered as pure blood citizen anymore and henceforth may be dead, nobody cares (the usual popular chauvinistic motive about second rate people in American movies)? «They killed Kenny!

Some obvious issues are slight and forgivable: - A rebel fighting force would not be using fixed runway aircraft such as the A-10 Warthog, such long runway installations would be easy targets for the machines and all would have been destroyed in the first minutes of the war.

","I like it! Yes, the original movie, bringing a new idea to the screen had more impact, Arnie's role was iconic, and the movie remains one of my top ten faves of all time.<br/><br/>Yes, T2 was let down by some overly cutesy PG-13-ness that complicated the simplicity of the of the 'terminator', that which was designed purely to kill. Knee-capping doesn't cut it, and the cringe-worthy thumbs up at the end was truly stomach churning, but it was still a good movie in its own right, and added lots of good stuff - not the least of which was stomping effects that still look good today. I still wish they'd gone with their original idea which was to have Arnie play a double role.<br/><br/>T3 was indeed pants by comparison, and whilst the T3 bad terminator did address one major technical issue in the construction (i.e. where's the T-1000's sodding memory chip, electrical system, power source, etc.?), it still failed to explain how the machine got through the time displacement equipment that was a: only able to transfer the T-101 because it was covered in living tissue, and neither it nor Kyle could bring weapons as they aren't living or cybernetic and b: destroyed after the T-101 went through to prevent any further messing with the timeline, at a point when the humans had apparently won, according to Kyle. I keep a copy though - despite its shortcomings it has its moments, and I do love a good old terminator punch up.<br/><br/>Which brings us to this movie. Finally. I thought Christian Bale was a great choice for John Conner, and the 'bad guy that wasn't' being a further experimentation of a cybernetic organism brings us back into line with the first movie - a little. At this stage, it's too late to bring the story back to the simplicity of the original, so ignore the issues with the time line which can, sort of, in a way, be explained anyway - remember this is a different version of the future ('one possible future' - as Kyle explains in the first movie). So let's just take it as it is.<br/><br/>It's a good romp, a new twist to the terminator plot, and another dose of terminator smackdown that's easy to enjoy. I liked the new machines - remembering that the T-101's etc. were designed as infiltration units and thus human-sized, if I were building a machine that's designed to kick ass without the need to infiltrate, I'd go large as well, and have multiple machines interconnect, to split off as the occasion demands - this is efficient. Those who whinge that it's 'just a copy of transformers', well, no, not really - but both are views of advanced, futuristic, intelligent robots, so why shouldn't there be a similarity? I thought the characters were good, but the only one I really connected with was Marcus Wright. I would have liked some more time to see the personalities of the characters and their relationships at the expense of some of the special effects and chase scenes.<br/><br/>I liked the 'halfway there' approach to the vision of the future we were given in the original, where humans use plasma rifles - clearly technology taken from the machines. It makes sense that at this stage they would be using the remnants of existing military hardware to form a rebellion. I also liked that John Connor wasn't in charge - that would be far too flat a storyline.<br/><br/>I think T4 felt like an introduction to new characters that will be developed later. It's not perfect, but it manages quite well in recovery of the plot lines from T2 and T3 and establishes a firm base for future movies to build on. It was entertaining (developing the plot in unexpected ways, robo-bashing aplenty, cool special effects that we've come to expect from this series tempered with honest to goodness action) and thought provoking. Is it original? Of course not - it's the fourth movie in a series dealing with a plot that was spelled out in 1984, and it can't deviate too far from that and remain a terminator movie.<br/><br/>I had low expectations, thinking it would follow the downward spiral of the last two movies, but I was pleasantly surprised. It's not going to make it into my top ten, but it's still a good example of the genre, a couple of hours well spent. Fingers crossed, we're all set for a brilliant Terminator 5."
"Shakor77","4","0","2","4 April 2010"," A sad disappointment
","When I first heard the brilliant Christian Bale would star in this movie I was so excited but for the first time, that I can remember, Christian Bale disappoints me.<br/><br/>But to be honest it is not just Christian Bales lackluster performance. This whole movie is a mess of special effects and incoherent and silly story. I mean, this is the movie where we would supposed to see the genius of John Connor and how he shows the humans how to fight the machines but the little glimpse of that is not shown byt the Connor character but by another one. That same one that in the first Terminator movie praised Connor to be such a genius. Makes no sense.<br/><br/>And that is probably where the biggest flaw in this movie lies. I expected this movie to get back on track after setting the dark atmosphere of the first Terminator movie. Instead it is just another, stupid action flick which is almost as terrible as Terminator 3.<br/><br/>Stay away from this one. It is not worthy of the Terminator name and it is certainly not worthy such a great actor like Christian Bale. Lets just hope the next one isn't as bad as this one."

","I enjoyed Terminator: Salvation for what is was: an exciting, decently-acted (could have actually been better, in my opinion, considering the quality of actors that are Christian Bale and Sam Worthington), action-filled Terminator movie. While not as enjoyable as T2, Terminator: Salvation tells an intriguing story that draws on elements of the first 2 Terminator movies stylishly.<br/><br/>The most intriguing aspect of 'Salvation' is the story it tells of Marcus Wright, a convicted murderer who is given a second chance at redemption. Marcus Wright's subtly powerful performance (well, not so subtle at some points, but overall...) is the best thing about the movie. Recommended for fans of the action genre, and extremely recommended for fans of the Terminator series of movies. This movie far exceeds T3 in every aspect."

","I liked Terminator 3. it was a fun action flick with some pretty nice action despite it was, well, a bit brainless. And action wise I liked McG's Charlies Angels movies as well despite they were even more brainless. So that in mind I don't have any reason to desperately hate Terminator Salavation as some hardcore James Cameron fans do.<br/><br/>So good things first. The special effects are good. The big robots, the small robots, flying and swimming robots look vicious and deadly. And that's it I think. Oh, the main cast does good with the material they're given. It always amazes me when actors can give even the most silliest lines with a serious face.<br/><br/>McG doesn't manage to get the movie going at any point of the story. Action scenes, while good looking, lack intensity and feel like they are out of steam. Then there's too many ""close calls"" for the main characters and that too gets boring quite quickly as well the fact, that I hardly connected to any of the characters.<br/><br/>Maybe it was the script or maybe it's McG's skills, I don't know. The whole movie felt like the makers didn't really know what they were doing with the material they had. The tone of the movie was very matter of fact serious, but it is filled with scenes that feel a bit goofy, despite they didn't make me laugh. They just feel odd in the mix, as if they had taken certain things just a bit further they'd made a flat out parody.<br/><br/>I can't really recommend T:S, but it's not the worst movie I've seen in my life."

","With the exception of a few interesting action scenes, and decent acting by Christian Bale, there's not much new in TERMINATOR SALVATION. The only exception is that we're fully immersed in the post-apocalyptic world and not time-traveling into the past ... which is why it got four stars from me instead of one or two.<br/><br/>I do love Christian Bale's acting chops. He is, to me, the complete action hero. His DARK KNIGHT performance cemented that. But you need more to make a good movie, and Terminator Salvation fails to give us a new (or even interesting) storyline. What's more alarming is that rumors are circulating that a Terminator 5 film is being considered. Oh boy. Perhaps it's time to lay this series to rest. I'm not saying that T5 will be bad, but if the track record for this series remains unchanged, then we won't be in for a highly successful sequel.<br/><br/>If you're familiar at all with any of the other three Terminator movies, you're aware of John Connor (played here by Christian Bale), the quintessential hero against the thinking machines; machines that have brought mankind to near extinction. In T4 we stay firmly in the future, fighting the crazed machine-made mankillers (with the exception of a brief stint in the present that rapidly moves us forward) and discovering that Marcus Wright (Sam Worthington, AVATAR) – a man from the past awakened in the future – has become a weapon for the machines by being an unawares accomplice in trying to eradicate the human population. When his true identity as a machine is finally revealed, it is as much a surprise to him as to the ""humans."" With the help of a young and feisty Kyle Reece (Anton Yelchin, STAR TREK), Marcus fights his way through the machines and into the safety of the humans. Here we see him battle with the knowledge of his new internal, metallic identity, and throw himself into the war. But who's side is he really on? This is ""The Big Question"" that the audience is supposed to ponder but, to no one's surprise, the embittered and oft-conflicted anti-hero makes ""The Right Choice."" <br/><br/>In addition to being a cliché, the movie even reinvents a scene from T2 in which a Terminator gets frozen and tries to break free. Been there. Done that. Let's move on people! <br/><br/>The final word I have on this film is that it really doesn't do what it should, which is to show us a great story about characters we've come to know through cinema. But instead, we got a rehashing of old themes with a bit of action eye-candy. Not much to it, really."

","Not since Daniel Craig pulled on his tuxedo in Casino Royale, or even when Joel Schumacher put nipples on the Bat-suit has there been such a backlash from fans over the creative decisions of their beloved franchises. Articles, websites and Facebooks pages where exhausted when the news came through that the director with the world's most ridiculous name was to helm the latest installment in the Terminator saga. Yes, McG (Joseph McGinty), fresh from the ""success"" of Charlie's Angels, was handed the job of steering the saga through its inevitable next chapter: post-Judgment Day. The war against the machines, only hinted at in the previous installments, but tantalisingly shown enough to make its audience want more, to see how Skynet evolved into the dominant ""species"" on the planet. And yet, now that we have it, it's slightly unsatisfying.<br/><br/>McG had talked a good game prior to Terminator Salvation's release, whetting our appetites with images of a bleak world, promising a dark, uncompromising war movie that would mirror the tone of The Dark Knight, now considered a cornerstone for franchise rebirths, as well as its successful concoction of character-driven story and dark, broody imagery, which is fast becoming common place. In addition, he had secured ""The Greatest Actor of his Generation"" in Christian Bale as prophesied Resistance head-honcho John Connor, who despite his initial rejection, jumped on board after another Dark Knight alum, screenwriter Jonathan Nolan, re-wrote the script to beef up Connor's involvement, which was minimal at best in earlier drafts. So, all set it seemed for another successful franchise reboot. Well, not quite.<br/><br/>Scribed, somewhat surprisingly by Terminator 3 writers John Brancato and Michael Ferris (also responsible for Catwoman), Salvation's biggest problem is focus. What should have been a story of Connor's emergence as human saviour, and all the burdens that come with it, are sidelined in favour of a redemption tale, centered on Sam Worthington's Marcus Wright. Previously seen on Death Row in 2003, just before T3's rescheduled Judgment Day, Marcus agrees to lend his body to science before biting the bullet, unaware of just exactly who it is going to (I won't say who if you haven't seen it, but I give you two guesses!) Waking up in 2018, Marcus soon finds himself integrating with both Connor, and a young resistance fighter named Kyle Reese (the excellent Anton Yelchin), all of them trying desperately to destroy Skynet and save mankind from further annihilation.<br/><br/>Worthington's is superb, his performance full of strength and burly charm, but his whole story arc feels slightly contrived, serving more as plot puller-along than anything more substantial, a problem that runs through the entire movie. Brancato and Ferris' script lacks the emotional depth and poignant core that we have come to love about the franchise, with its human story always at the forefront rather than the action, Instead the writers load the screen with some overblown and over elaborate action, as well as numerous monolithic machines in a tale more akin to Michael Bay's vacuous Transformers films than Cameron's original vision. Even Bale gets little chance to shine; his Connor is more spoilt brat than leader, leaving no room for him to exert his normal devoted self, a talent that would have served the character beautifully if he had been allowed. Despite this, and his ridiculous insistence on growling throughout, Bale is so naturally magnetic that he could read the Yellow Pages for two hours and still be as watchable as ever.<br/><br/>McG too does a fine job, exercises some of his Charlie's Angels demons by delivering some entertaining set-pieces (the Bale/helicopter scene and the films big cameo moment stand out), as well producing some wonderfully stark imagery (helped by the now infamous DoP Shane Hurbult), doing just enough with the story to keep the doubters at bay. Whether he gets another crack at the whip is another story.<br/><br/>Perhaps I'm just too big a fan of Cameron's films that I would have more negative regardless of who took over the franchise, but there are still great Terminator stories to be told. The Sarah Connor Chronicles, for example, which despite its cancellation, is the closest we may ever get to the franchise continuing in Cameron's original vision, with its successful marriage of story and depth, as well as excitement. At best, Salvation, while entertaining and fun in places, is on the whole a wasted opportunity, What should have been a film about man's struggle to survive against insurmountable odds, as well as Connor's rise to leader, becomes just another load-em-up, blow-em-up blockbuster, with lots of block and buster, but lacks invention and guile, as well as emotional punch, two things its siblings, and ""template"" The Dark Knight had in spades. This, sadly, isn't quiet the future James Cameron had told me about."

","This film is not as bad as many say. It's biggest strengths are be the pretty solid production quality and the cinematography. Latter really has it's moments. Also, the movie features a surprisingly dark tone which I can usually only dream about regarding other blockbusters. refreshing. Unfortunately this barely saves the movie from the incontinent script, that seemingly no one had found a way to really handle. Instead the director and the actors (very noticeable on Bale who's still playing Batman) just seem to roll along with it, efficiently working towards their paycheck. They are doing an OK job by the way, given the conditions of course. We actually do have professional people here. So things happen, it looks good, it feels alright, let's ignore the plot holes but then towards the finale this whole thing becomes more and more dull and in the end it just declares itself absolutely pointless considering the big picture, pushing the movie into TV spin off terethory, which I found borderline criminal. Was this really the story of how John Connor got a new heart? <br/><br/>I seems that there's not too much more juice left in the Terminator lemon. Please, dear producers, have some foresight and invest in some new epic sagas. With platitudinous Star Wars needing to be resurrected for the third time soon, we're running out of so much as a dead horse to beat."

","James Cameron's vision of the Terminator series was a very epic and revolutionary films. The first film, he gives you his vision of a dark and distant future and shows you something that you had never seen before. The second film, instead of him remaking the first film at a greater scale (a bigger one if I might add), he gives you something that you never seen before, the birth of CGI.<br/><br/>The third on the other hand, is a remake of the second one but even at a bigger scale. The film wasn't really epic and revolutionary as the first two and the only thing that was significant was the ending.<br/><br/>Salvation almost gives back the audience what the series deserves. The acting by Christian Bale and Sam Worthington were excellent and they dominated the film.

","Having missed seeing this movie during its short run at the cinema (the phrase 'tanked at the box office' applies here) I was looking forward to its release on DVD.<br/><br/>I had little idea what the plot was about, except from the trailer they had already spoiled the part where Sam Worthington's character achieved a level of self-awareness. If he was a cyborg, how didn't he notice that he had Terminator-vision, with the red filter, annoying pop-ups and targeting/tagging of everything in sight?<br/><br/>I watched the 'extended version' and was entertained. It was not your formula Terminator film (task-focussed killing machine gets sent back from future, lone good-guy follows, explosions ensue) but gave us a different type of story that I found interesting.<br/><br/>I thought the film lacked humour and the poignant moments we enjoyed in T2 (especially the director's cut). The saddest part of the whole movie was discovering that Stan Winston died last year. (If you are a sci-fi newbie you may have to Google him or search him on IMDb.) A must-see is the DVD special feature - Reforging the Future. I don't think Stan would have been disappointed in the way his work had been carried on. I gained an appreciation for the amount of effort that had gone into producing this movie, especially in the art direction and visual effects departments.<br/><br/>Regarding the film itself, there is little to add to the litany of 'I didn't care about the characters enough' and 'Christian Bale yelled too much' complaints. Seriously folks, this is just a movie, and who goes to a Terminator film for the emotional experience??? I go expecting stuff to get blown up, and for Terminators to do their job and kill people. Stuff did get blown up, but what happened to the killing? PG-13, that's what! Helena Bonham Carter was perfectly cast as a creepy doctor from Cyberdyne, while a curly-haired little girl was an unnecessary inclusion.<br/><br/>I hear that the script was rewritten during filming at the insistence of Christian Bale. There's your Salvation right there. Without that, it would have really bombed and then no more Terminator movies. (Just second-rate made-for-TV stuff with Summer Glau.) As it turned out, T4 Salvation just broke even, and may make some extra $$ if you rent or buy the DVD.<br/><br/>The question to be answered by any review is 'Should I see this movie?' and when? The answers are: if you enjoy a Terminator film, yes. Rent the standard DVD version and wait till you have upgraded your home theatre before you buy the Blu-ray disc for your collection.<br/><br/>And if you think you have wasted your hard-earned dollars, don't blame me. Blame McG and the writers. Then sell your copy on eBay."

","This sequel (or should it be prequel?) to the Terminator series is the worst of them all. And I don't write worst because it's bad, because the film in itself is nearly great, I write bad because it doesn't live up to it's predecessors ambitions and that is what it's all about in an x-installment of a series specially so challenging and defiant as Terminator.<br/><br/>Director McG mostly known for his appearances in the film industry as a producer (Charlie's Angels) is given, in my opinion, an overwhelming task, to make a great action flick related at some level with the Terminator franchise. But at what level? Because this postapocalyptic scenario with merciless indestructible robots and desperate on the break of extinction humans just isn't there. Here everything is more settled, with human beings roaming over the Earth just being careful not to cross paths with a Terminator and battles in which you come to ask yourself how can Skynet be so bad at annihilating the human race with all the resources and technology at her disposal. Even in one scene it's the own robots that are escaping from humans chased by a couple of prewar A-10s! Yeah, we are truly super-humans, bright and strong, went it comes to do with desperate suicidal situations. But well, everything here can be forgiven for the main cause, the action (ACTION! ACTION! ACTION!) and that is what McG is so good at if you can forget about the story. MCG as truly shown to everybody that he can do great action. He's really good at it. The problem is he is not all that good in all.<br/><br/>Then comes the plot, who said the story isn't important in action films? Excuse me sir, but this is not just a mid-summer night evasion, it's THE action-sci-fi series. Through the series we came to see compelling characters and heart touching moments alongside with intelligent issues to discuss of when coming out of the cinema. Yet everything here has changed. The two first introductory scenes starring Sam Worthington are truly revealing charged with beautiful Christian symbols, though i'm not Christian, implying the arrival of a savior in an apocalytical era. And from here, everything goes loose, specially the characters as there is no real story apart the one you're thinking out in your head, trying to figure how it will end up while watching the film, that will be surely better than the original one.<br/><br/>Is John Connor (Christian Bale) there? In some sort. He does all the shouting and tries of his best to save the day. Impressive. Thanks a lot and remember John, you are the Resistance, don't forget those words as you will seem as a mute without them. Is Kate Connor there? Yeah but she's pregnant so she won't boder a lot with the action. She's just pregnant and that's it, it's the only thing you need to know even if she appears more than usual in front of the camera. And who's Barnes? Oh yeah, that's the wanna-be lieutenant always stucked to Connor who will give is life for him but not in a biblical sense. Cool hum? Oh, and the hot girl, Blair Williams so charming and yet so cold, she seems even to be brighter and more fully realized than the rest. Sam Worthington – Marcus Wright – is maybe the most interesting character of the whole, but not because the script writer had a bit of imagination left but just because he is supposed to be the key to everything. And yet he fails, and that is what makes fail the story, if there is at least one or two characters that make advance the story with a touching ending this movie could have been easily much better than what it is right now.<br/><br/>I'm terribly sorry if this review as exceeded itself a bit, but hey, it's Terminator, you can write about it in one paragraph. Thanks a lot for you interest and watch the film with an open mind, it's reasonably good, really."

It has the ""millenial touch"" as I like to call it (but well executed)...that divergent break from 90s film-making. In response to the lack of characterization: If every city around me has been nuked, I'm constantly being hunted, and I'm eating table scraps (or not at all) to live off of, my personality is not going to be very colorful. This is the human holocaust...not much to smile about. The world created here is fairly accurate and truthful to the franchise...with some creative license to create additional machines. The CGI is mindblowingly good...to the point that you know it has to be CGI, but can't really tell in the majority of the scenes. There is a plot, its pretty good and original to some extent...and it is interesting. Yes performances are a little flat, but to me, the immersive (majorly immersive) world created here takes care of the rest. My bar is high, I have to give it a 7.

She's given absolutely nothing to do. It is Worthington (Marcus) and Bloodgood who have real characters to work with. I agree with some who are tried of the terminators trying to do 'retroactive abortions' on John Connor; enough!.

","There are a lot of people who say that this movie was a complete disgrace to the franchise, but I will have to kinda disagree. I mean it was obviously not perfect, but it will entertain. It's definitely not as bad as some reviews here say it is. Now let's start with the bad aspects of the film. Firstly, there were parts of the movie where the pacing was a bit slow. Also, they tried to link back to the previous movies, like when Kyle Reese used the rather famous line ""Come with me if you want to live"". But you kinda have to expect this from some Hollywood blockbusters these days. The final thing that I found bad about this movie is the dialogue, because the dialogue didn't really meet my expectations. Okay, enough with the bad aspects. Let's get into the good aspects of the movie. Firstly, the action were pretty damn awesome. I'm pretty sure some people might disagree with me on this, but I think it was rather well done. Although some scenes were a bit too loud and noise, it still provided good special effects. So to conclude, this movie is a good action movie that has it's flaws. Although there are some flaws to this movie, the action sequences easily makes up for it. It definitely has its problems, but I still recommend it for a rental. Thanks for reading!"

","When I first heard that McG was going to be helming the Terminator franchise, I vowed never to watch it again. How could the man responsible for the Charlie's Angels movies possibly handle The Terminator? However, after seeing some impressive previews, I decided to take the risk and watch it.<br/><br/>I was pleasantly surprised.<br/><br/>Terminator Salvation does a lot of things right. It shows us the apocalyptic world we have been longing to see for a quarter of a century. The atmosphere is great, kind of crossing the Terminator franchise with Mad Max.<br/><br/>There are several brilliant action sequences in the film, from a Terminator motor bike chase to an impressive mine field fight scene. The story does away with the time travel aspect, something that was becoming strained in the series, and introduces an interesting premise of a Terminator being chased rather than a human.<br/><br/>The problem in this film lies in the characters. They are completely bland and underdeveloped. John Connor, the most important character in the series, takes a back seat role, and Sam Worthington's character seems to accept waking up in a post-apocalyptic world way too easily. Actors such as Common and Bryce Dallas Howard seem to have completely pointless roles in the movie, and seem to be only there to offer John Connor occasional words of advice.<br/><br/>The only character that seems to survive the film is Anton Yelchin's role as Kyle Reese. Yelchin does a fantastic job portraying a younger version of the character, and you can truly see him developing into the character we met in the original movie.<br/><br/>Had this film been 30 minutes long, and with a little more character development, it could have been right up there with the first two movies.<br/><br/>Shame."

","If you compare this to Terminator 2 then you will feel disappointed, but if you look at it as just an action film in its own right then you won't mind it so much. I was under the impression that their would be some character development in this film since they got talented actors Christian Bale and Bryce Dallas Howard to appear in this film. Turns out that was just a trick, we don't get to see them do any acting, they might as well have just had cardboard cut outs.<br/><br/>Sam Worthington proves that he deserves to be thrust into the action spotlight, he has Avatar and Clash of the Titans coming up as well. Within a years time this almost unknown actor will have appeared in three huge movies. I first saw him in this independent Australian film called Somersault and thought he was pretty decent in that. He holds Terminator Salvation together, if they had gotten a suck actor to play his part this film would have crumbled.<br/><br/>There wasn't much originality within the construction of a futuristic society, looked similar to a number of other crappy futuristic movies.

But you have to look at it from a different perspective.The first two were totally different movies is comparison with this one.The setting and mood were completely different. ""The Terminator"" was a thriller/horror movie, and ""Judgement Day"" was an action movie ultimately.Both were set in the past. ""Salvation"" on the other hand,is an apocalyptic war film.

OK, he won't win an Oscar, but give the guy some credit, he went into this film with criticism bouncing in from all sides, and I think he did a good job, especially in the action scenes.<br/><br/>Negatives:<br/><br/>1) Too short. The film could have been about 10-15 minutes longer, and these extra minutes should have been used to expand character development. <br/><br/>2) Characters. There was too many all at once, and there was no clear definition of who was the main character, for ten minutes it was John Connor, then for the next ten it was Marcus.Maybe it meant to be like that, I don't know. <br/><br/>3) The PG-13 rating. OK, so the studio wanted to allow younger audiences to be able to see this film,fair enough, it was obviously about the money anyway. But still, why have a Terminator if they are not....em Terminating? A bit more blood and graphic death would have changed many people's overall view I think.<br/><br/>Overall, a well made film that gives a good insight into the future of the Terminator universe. Hopefully, for the next film, the film-makers will go that extra step further and bump up the rating to an R, and correct the issues I have stated. Recommended for fans of Sci-fi. 8/10"

","After just recently been watching this film, I tuned in to IMDb to check the reviews as I'd like to do. In my opinion this film isn't quite as bad as many other seem to think.<br/><br/>From most stand points, film no 4 in the series can't compare to the first 2. However, I liked this more than T3.<br/><br/>The positive things are parts of the scenery which are like the futuristic wasteland and things like design and retrospective Terminator ""feeling"". In my belief, this is crucial for a good sci fi film. Also there's somewhat a real interesting religious analogy (intentional or not).<br/><br/>There are numerous of flaws (logic and otherwise). One thing I can't understand is the U.S. way of constantly needing to specify year/date etc. This is one certain thing you could leave out of a science fiction film.<br/><br/>To sum up, I wouldn't really recommend this film to other than fans of Terminator films or mindless nonsense action lovers. But who am I to decide - make up your own mind."

","Now, I'm not going to lie about my experience with this film series, and will admit that I never saw a Terminator film. But that doesn't help any. One of the only characters I actually cared about was the person called Marcus Wright, with whom the film started. It was a very interesting character with how he came to be, and such, and how he was revealed. So we come to know that the ancestor of John Connor has been lost in some wasteland near L.A. by accident, and a few people go to look for him. That's all good, and the film steadily progresses. Later in the film John Connor reveals himself to be an absolute asshole towards Marcus by torturing him incredibly, practically erasing the need to be sympathetic to Johnny. What John Connor did in this film to some people, only a villain would do. And yet he's regarded as the hero of this flick? I was disgusted by the ending of this flick precisely because John Connor, in this film, was such a cruel man pretending to care about others. I won't spend any more words on this, and just call it: Terminator: Injustice. Seriously. If the previous Terminator movies are anything like this, I won't even bother to watch those."

But he failed to see that we may come out of the theater with too many questions on the given answers.

","Few minor spoilers ------------------<br/><br/>Just saw it around 30 minutes ago and must say that it was not as bad as the critics etc. said it was.<br/><br/>Good Parts first ---------------- First of all the action, CGI & stunts, were well done and believable. The movie had a very real feel to it, a bit like The Dark Knight. The post judgment day world was not forced on us, we could feel it by the look and atmosphere of the movie's environment.<br/><br/>There were many references to the first 3 installments + an encounter with a very important T-101 / T-800.<br/><br/>Overall acting was good though a bit wooden sometimes. But i guess John Conner & the other survivors have so much on his mind that they have to be played with little or no emotion. <br/><br/>OK now two the bad parts ------------------------<br/><br/>I did not like how the infiltrator was able to have so much free will, being a programable machine i mean.<br/><br/>The plot could have been better and the interactions between the various characters had a certain ham handedness to it.<br/><br/>It was too easy to get into and out of Cybernet HQ, i mean isn't the technology supposed to be cutting edge, out there.<br/><br/>There were some plot holes and unexplained things etc.<br/><br/>OK Final Word --------------<br/><br/>Not as bad as Wolverine (That one sucked big time) Not as bad as Transformers 2 (Only redeeming factor was tits/ass + some good CGI Robt on Robt action) Not as bad as T3 (Don't get me started on that one, but i liked the flower sun shades)<br/><br/>Have fun and enjoy and wait for AVATAR<br/><br/>By the way guys if you liked my review watch ""The man from earth"" you may like it."

","The movie is bad.. very bad.<br/><br/>I looked to the heavens.. I said Arnold would have to leave that stupid job he has now and come save this Terminator thing.<br/><br/>The movie starts with potential. And that potential is never realized. Some parts are effin stupid and make no sense, have no coherence.<br/><br/>I always loved Terminator because it was manly. Full stop. Terminator Salvation throws in two cute girls in the middle of the effing movie, doing cute shite.. and their hair is well done all the time, the men on the other hand look like shite.<br/><br/>The Terminators apparently die very easily in the future. Except this one weird Terminator created by some shid hole.. he thinks he's a human or some cont, has a heart. Blah..<br/><br/>When the terminators are whipping out bullets at the little gay characters running away, apparently all 100 rounds fired miss. Even when the resistance was firing at the weird terminator created by a cont hole and the cute girl that betrayed the resistance (and was eventually let off the hook, and was making herself a cute ass); the resistance only managed to hit her once in the leg.<br/><br/>The terminators suffered brain damage somewhere along the lines. They stopped killing people. The people themselves were always aiming at one another.. the terminators were slow, and apparently a human can block a cuff from one of them.<br/><br/>Animals that eat people can do a better job at finding where the Resistance is than these machines. When they were about to test this signal and blew up something(to get a terminator's attention).. when this plane terminator came it somehow couldn't locate John Connor and Common who had his facial hair well done.<br/><br/>When on the other hand, they were blowing up shite to catch the half human, half terminator cont hole.. the machines were busy eating ice-cream to notice. I like the movie 300 because it is manly and doesn't have cute bitches trying to be effing cute. I don't know what d' eff happen to T-Salvation.<br/><br/>There is a part at the end when another cute bitch is talking to the half human, half terminator cont hole explaining to him whats up.. and I haven't heard such cheesy crap in a long time.

"aydinkuru","5","0","2","7 July 2009"," This doesn't deserve more then Terminator 3.
","First of all, the movie was far away from the Terminator theme. It didn't have the same feeling of Terminator Trilogy. However, thats not why I vote so low. The movie had serious storyline problems and a lot of advertisement.<br/><br/>Here are the problems of the story: -T-600 is supposed to be the keeper who should make sure that no human can get away from Skynet territories. But they can't spot anything that doesn't move. Remember that Marcus and Kyle faced a T600 and saved thereselfs by not moving. Didn't make sense to me. -A major problem here; Terminator:Salvation is the future of the characters of The Terminator Trigoly. In T:S, Kyle Reese is 19-20 years old. In T1, he's 29-30 years old, or even more. The problem is that Skynet has researched the T-800 when Kyle was 20 years old, but why they where using T-800 for a very important terminating mission? Haven't they researched anything in 10 years? Or they update Terminators every 10 year? If so, why they researched to T-600 in only 10 years? Doesn't make sense at all. -Why there are only 3 terminators inside the major Skynet Industruis? Is Skynet vulnerable to any attack to its base? -Who are those Rebbelion commanders anyway? Isn't John Connor supposed to lead the army of Rebbelion to victory?<br/><br/>Anyway, the movie wasn't good. It surely will not join a Terminator Quatrology."
"overcranked","6","0","2","6 July 2009"," Expectations were low, so I enjoyed it
","When a movie series exceeds a trilogy I tend to become leery of each film that comes out. It can become far to easy to pump out a script with a predictable formula that Hollywood knows will work to get butts in the seats. It is an unfortunate part of the movie business, but it is after all a business. Because of this I was doing my best to refrain from getting overly excited about Terminator Salvation. Helping me to restrain my anticipation was the simple fact that McG was directing it. I mean seriously? You call yourself ""McG"" and wonder why Hollywood doesn't take you seriously? However, that's an entirely different post. So, thanks to the specter of McG, and the fact that the third installment of the Terminator franchise was not so great, I kept my expectations down and did my best to not be too excited. I think this was an effective method to use in this case because it made the movie that much more enjoyable.<br/><br/>We pick up the Terminator story in the year 2018, and the war between Skynet and mankind has been raging ever since Judgment Day. Over the last three films we've been seeing the same story: A Terminator is sent back in time to kill John/Sarah Connor and a protector is sent back to protect them from the Terminator. I think it is to the credit of this movie that they strayed from that format and gave us a more original take on the struggle between the Connor family and Skynet. This time around John Connor, played by Christian Bale (The Dark Knight, The Machinist, American Psycho), is being dubbed a false prophet by the leaders of the human resistance, but is being looked to as a rallying figure for the rest of humanity. In his life long struggle with Skynet Connor has come to know his enemy, but his enemy has also come to understand that their methods in the past have failed.<br/><br/>This movie also introduces a new character Marcus Wright, played by Sam Worthington (Hart's War, The Great Raid), Marcus is an ex-con who somehow has been brought back to life after being executed prior to Judgment Day. I was unsure of how I felt about Marcus, but as the movie worn on it became obvious that he was stealing the show in this film. Yes, Christian Bale is a talented actor and I enjoy his work, but while his performance is what I would expect of an older, war-hardened John Connor, Marcus steals every scene he's in.<br/><br/>Overall I think Terminator Salvation overcame the third installment in the series, and has setup Terminator for another entertaining three films. There's enough here for old fans to enjoy the film like references to the previous films that go beyond the, ""I'll be back"" and ""Come with me if you want to live"" lines. There hare many more subtle nods to the previous films that any die hard fan will recognize. For new fans it's simple enough of a story that they won't be lost, but interesting enough to get them to wonder, ""why is it that John Connor has been fighting these machines since he was born?"" and go catch up on the story. I think that Terminator Salvation proved that it is possible to make an entertaining movie without throwing the same old schlock at audiences.<br/><br/>Written by Josh for www.overcranked.net"
"grsnider3","6","0","2","6 July 2009"," Decent Matinée Movie.... But NOT a $10 movie
","I am a big fan of the Terminator movies (T-2 my favorite) and greatly anticipated (along with many others, I'm sure) this new sequel. Lucky for me, I was able to see the movie at a matinée price, which helped ease the minor disappointment. The new casting looked very interesting - especially with Christian Bale as John Conner. So I was very intrigued by the prospects the film brought. Then the movie started. For those of you who haven't seen it yet, PLEASE MAKE SURE YOU LISTEN VERY CAREFULLY to the duologue at the beginning. Stop munching on your popcorn during the first 5-10 minutes, because you have to deal with Helena Bohnam Carter whispering key info. The opening of the movie is very confusing and is not really revealed until much later - what actually happened. Director, McG does an adequate job giving us newer and more deadly Machines - some of the effects are pretty cool. But you gotta wonder that after the smackdown of some of the characters in the film and the beating that they took, how they even managed not to be seriously injured. An average Joe, like you and me, would be in ICU after some of the whoopings provided by the Machines - or just plain dead. The actors in this rendition are attractive - especially Bryce Howard (you could fall in love with those eyes!) and the actor playing Marcus does a nice job. Bale doesn't quite live up to expectations after his superior BatMan. Overall, the movie gets 6 stars from me. Not bad. But not a great sequel. One last reminder, ... listen closely to the duologue. Throughout the movie, the actors love to whisper their lines."
"marc242","6","0","2","5 July 2009"," Solid, but (sadly) not brilliant.
","Alright then. I had pretty high hopes for this one, it is definitely not as bad as everyone said (T3 is much much worse). Technically it is certainly above the crop of most summer blockbusters, but cuts away a lot of needed storyline and character development to make room for pure spectacle.<br/><br/>Visually it takes a lot of inspiration from MAD MAX and BLACK HAWK DOWN, which sets it apart from its (Jim Camerons') Origins. Gone is the familiar steely blue and red illuminated imagery, the cold chrome of the Terminators is replaced by a rusty and soot-covered look. It certainly looks very raw and crude, which is fitting for such a post-apocalyptic setting, but the grit is reserved only for the overall look of the film, everything else is well within the confines of its PG-13 rating. The kid-friendly rating means: Violent scenes seem truncated, and the threat by Skynets' Terminators is mellowed down to a degree that is not tolerable anymore. Granted, Jim Camerons original movies were decidedly NOT a Gorefest, but he used the very few violent scenes very artfully. These scenes underlined the menace of these unstoppable killing machines from the future, this feeling of dread is almost gone in the latest installment of the franchise.<br/><br/>The Structure of T4 is a bit disjointed in the first third of the movie. It constantly jumps between the parallel running story lines of Marcus Wright and John Connor. Its certainly not a good thing to have two leading men in one movie, and it shows. I heard that the original draft of T4 had only Marcus Wright as the main man, and John Connor as an unseen Presence off-screen. That would have been the wiser choice, as the constant struggling between the two leads does hurt the movie. Both Christian Bale and Sam Worthington are good actors, but they should have been ""seperated"", at least for this one. <br/><br/>A word on Christian Bales performance: Some reviewers said that Bale was ""overacting"", but I think this is not entirely true. When he does his speeches, its certainly chuckle-inducing as the almost Shakespearian tone of some of his lines is a bit corny. (""Devil hands have been busy""). I think he is more effective in his action parts,when he only has to deliver short and snazzy lines. Then he is really good. When you see him argue with Michael Ironside, screaming into the radio, this is more like it. <br/><br/>Another thing is the soundtrack. I'm sorry, but I think Danny Elfman was simply the wrong choice for this project. His refusal (?) to include the famous Terminator Theme by Brad Fiedel is simply unforgivable. Apart from this omission, the soundtrack lacks a certain oomph , it feels like temp music throughout. I listened to it 3-4 Times, but there was simply nothing out of the ordinary. The opening theme is not bad, but it does not sound like Elfman put a lot of work into it. This continues a trend of mediocre Elfman scores, and I have a feeling that he has lost his touch somehow. He is in unfamiliar territory, and it shows. <br/><br/>Overall, TERMINATOR SALVATION is a solid, but definitely not flawless entry into the Series. It has many problems in the story department, and I have a distinct feeling that the upcoming ""Director's Cut"" will be somewhat better. As I heard there were about 30-40 Minutes cut away from the movie. Of course, a longer version does not mean it will be better by default, but I am very curious what was cut, and if it helps to make the storyline a bit more logical."

","As this picture is part of a franchise its hard not to think back to previous films but with Terminator 3 being a disappointment I didn't expect much from this either. The film in general was so-so, Christian Bale's John Connor sparked no relation to previous portrayals, instead what we saw was a cold and distant Connor. I never thought it would have been a good idea to base a Terminator film solely on the aftermath of Judgement day as with just small snippets of it in the first films it managed to keep a certain mystery which added to the appeal of the story. The character 'Marcus Wright' played by Sam Worthington is what kept this movie fueled enough to last the duration. The only thing that interests me about this film is that its basically a prequel set in the future. 'Yelchin' was good as 'Kyle Reese' but the nostalgia just didn't seem to hit me the way it should have. This story is done and if any other installment is released I would do my best to avoid it."

But it was a total waste of money, Terminator Salvation is the worst terminator movie ever. It is a bad, very bad sequel of the iconic terminator series. Only the guest appearance of Arnold later in the film made me remember this was a sequel to the terminator series, rest nothing in the movie notches up to the mark.Even the series' famous dialog, ""I'll be back"" is wasted in the movie by using it in a very weak scene.<br/><br/>There's no absolutely depth in the story, it just doesn't engross you.<br/><br/>To me, Terminator Salvation is like just another nameless action movie. Only the name of this movie connects it to the previous terminator movies.<br/><br/>Just like many other sequels to some celebrated films, Terminator Salvation has also succumbed to hype and pressure.<br/><br/>I am a big fan of the terminator series, but I was deeply disappointed on seeing this one, it looks like someone who has no understanding of what a good movie is has made this film."

","So this one has absolutely NO humor in it at all, and maybe that's what felt ""off"" to me about it - it's just so thoroughly dark, bleak and plodding throughout, with even the action scenes having this weirdly dank feeling about them. This is a very foreign, detached movie, with characters you barely know due to changes in actors and new ones that you're not given time to be accustomed to, what with the generally pulverizing pace of the film, and I'm not sure that's a good thing, because this film is just so hard to really get into because of it. It never relents and gives you time to care about the characters like the old ones did; you're just supposed to accept who they are and be swept up in the ride. It doesn't even feel like a Terminator film a lot of the time, which is a big point against it - with some alterations, this could just be another random action epic. It seems stunted and incomplete.<br/><br/>I do like the settings though, they were very, very well crafted. This entire film looked GREAT, that is for sure. The action was loud and in your face at all times, sometimes flat-out overwhelming the viewer, but always being really flashy and over the top. They aren't very captivating, though.<br/><br/>Really, though, the ending DID leave me disappointed, being way too cliché and half-cocked for me to really feel inspired by it, especially after seeing the other movies so recently..."
"yankeeskins","6","0","3","23 June 2009"," not bad, but not great
","The main problem with this movie is the story and lack of character development. The director isn't sure who should be the ""star"" of the movie: connor or the machine. For some reason, the director chose not to inform us of what connor did which would explain why he is no longer the leader of the resistance. and you really don't get a good backstory on the machine. the story hops back and forth between both the machine and connor and never develops both. And honestly, none of the characters were really developed. also, like most have already posted, you see how the ending is going to play out 10 mins before we get there.<br/><br/>I will say that the action is OK (i would have liked to see tons more machines) but the sound is AWESOME. this could be a DVD buy just for the sound alone. probably won't be good for those who live in apartments.<br/><br/>Lastly, to all the Bale haters.....get over yourselves. If you see how intensly he played the role you would think you would understand why he had the outburst. but no, you just want to slobber over all other bloggers who want to make a name for themselves. he delivered a great performance given the material he was provided to work with."

","...be sure to wear a gadget in your hair. Marcus Wright does, and although it can't save him, it helps him to die later rather than sooner. Much like some flowers might have gotten you into Haight Ashbury back in the day, the control chip at the back of his head gets him into Skynet central. Hippies and robots, they're not so different after all. Okay, perhaps ""Salvation"" isn't the best part of the series. Perhaps the series wasn't all that great to begin with. Taken at face value, this isn't a bad movie at all. Given all the paradoxes and pitfalls time travel can bring, the plot is a lot less messy than I expected. In fact, it almost works better as a stand-alone road movie than as a save-the-world sequel. Despite one or two bouts of nostalgia, Arnold is only a distant memory. This is really more ""Salvation"" than ""Terminator"". As an apocalyptic road movie, it shares the genes of younger stock like ""28 Days Later"", ""Resident Evil Extinction"", or ""Reign of Fire"". In fact, Christian Bale's gruff John Connor feels like a darker version of Quinn Abercromby, Bale's character in ""Reign of Fire"". CSI's Moon Goodblood, as Blair Williams, makes a very handsome sidekick in her form-fitting rebel suit. But the stars of ""Salvation"" are the twin Robobikes that drop from the giant Terminator's knees. You never see them coming until they're right behind you.

","Let's face it, Terminator: Salvation was not a movie that needed to happen. In a world now plagued by over-embellished and drawn out franchises, Terminator was not a franchise that needed another sequel. But, this movie was made anyways; and it served its purpose: to make money. This movie was different than how I thought it would be going into it. I don't know exactly what I expected, but what I expected was something a little more well done than this. It wasn't bad. However, and I told this to everyone who asked how it was, it was missing something. It focused so hard and getting the audience to say ""Wow, that was cool-looking"" that if forgot to make the audience say, ""Wow, this is a good movie. It was entertaining, but not necessarily enjoyable. <br/><br/>The six stars are for the action, special effects, and cinematography. The action was good, and when combined with the state-of-the-art special visual and sound effects and compelling cinematography McG and the Terminator crew managed to produced some decent and engaging action sequences. Everyone loves vehicle scenes, and the chase scene between the service truck and the auto-terminators was one of my favorite scenes in the movie. Also, Worthington and Yeltsin gave fairly acceptable performances. <br/><br/>Of course, there are four stars that aren't there. The story was a little loose; and the scene progression and editing were slightly uncomfortable at times. Christian Bale didn't do stellar. I couldn't see him as John Connor before seeing the movie, and don't see him as Connor even after seeing it. I don't think he was the right choice, and that opinion isn't entirely based on his uncalled-for outrage on the set. He just didn't go great. His over-theatricality made him even less believable in the role than he already was. Bale's John Connor voice was somewhere in between Bruce Wayne and Batman: the character I think most in the audience still see him as. <br/><br/>However, these things seemed to not hold my attention for long while watching it. This is after all an action film and the action does help the movie stay alive. Without it though, I don't think the movie would be as good. But some good things were there, which is why I gave Terminator: Salvation a 6 instead of a 5. T2 was something special. Terminator: Salvation was nothing special. It's just a movie.

","Just before the premiere I watched all three parts so I could refresh my memories. It's clear that T2 set the bar very high and I wasn't expecting much from this movie. It was actually the first terminator movie I saw on the big screen. The action scenes were great, and I liked the idea of more ""human"" terminator, which flows like a trend line in all terminator movies (especially T2). The movie was fast-paced and action packed, as a sci-fi flick should be in 2009. The soundtrack was OK. But there was something missing. And no - it wasn't Arnold, nevertheless they really got a star from me with his CGI appearance. It was obvious that the director had payed attention to details from the past movies and we even got to know how John Connor got his scar. I really wanted to see the dark doomy scenarios from the previous movies - nuclear winter and stuff you know. Maybe this is because T4 takes place in the beginning of the war, who knows. The real disappointment for me was the cast, and especially Cristian Bale. Don't get me wrong - I can't act better so I shouldn't be criticizing. He did a great performance in the Dark Knight and obviously tried really hard for the part of John Connor. It's just he doesn't fit in that role. I heard that Arnold was first offered the Kyle Reese character but he chose to be the Terminator, and given his modest acting capabilities he actually chose the part that fits him best. Bale just can't be John Connor. Even Leonardo Di Caprio would have fitted better (although he always dies in the end). Now back to the idea of the ""human"" cyborg - come on - that heart thing was a bit too much. Let's teleport Einstein from the past and transplant his brain into Connor's head then, should we?<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong - I actually liked the movie and enjoyed watching it a lot.

","The movie has obvious influences from Matrix and Apocalypse Now but it's certainly very far from their quality standards. Compared to its predecessors, it is aimed at a younger audience, not in the sense that it is a bloodless story but violence is definitely less strong - with almost no cussing and many scenes conceived much more from a ""PlayStation"" point of view. The first part is a decent stuff, with action coming fast; the tension slows with the introduction of Marcus's improbable alliance with Blair Williams, a character not that suitable. The rest of the cast gives good performances, Anton Yelchin in particular being very good as Kyle Reese. But the thing is that the lead character Christian Bale leaves a bit to be desired, reminding Batman all the time (wasn't it another film?). Nevertheless I'd say that the biggest difference between this and the earlier Terminator flicks is its lacking of a sense of danger. Arnold Schwarzenegger and Robert Patrick got to be believable when menacing the human race as the unstoppable machines. On the contrary in this story, aside from the continuous and numerous references to the earlier films, the threat doesn't seem incisive."

I am yet to see a film of Bale's that I haven't either been shocked or compelled by but this film just felt a little unfinished.<br/><br/>Bale was excellent not that he could do much with Connor's character having already been completely mapped out by the previous 2 films and the action sequences were amazing. The only section where the CGI seemed to stand out was when John Connor rides away on a terminator-motorbike.<br/><br/>The rest of the actors were fine, no complaints really and I was even surprised by the directing. Even though McG is new school, he lets the action sequences flow like the good old school directors such as Cameron and Scott with none of the horrible chopping featured in Bay's films like Transformers that annoys the hell out of me and makes it hard to see what the hell is actually happening! The big problem with this film is the story, or lack of one. The writers have written a seemingly central and very important character into this already mapped out storyline which has no mention or connection to the other films.<br/><br/>This whole story and idea just seemed unnecessary to me when they could have had a similar but better storyline by setting it approximately 5 years later on without the addition of these extra invented and implausible characters. They could have and should have written about the friendship between Connor and Reese and the daily struggle to survive with the story perhaps ending when Connor sends Reese back in time to become his father! Anyways, go and see it because it is worth seeing... It could have and should have been so much more though!"

","I walked out of terminator salvation with more questions than i had begun in with. I walked in wondering whether despite the general critique of the film (which seems quite divided) would i re-live some of the emotions i had had when i first saw terminator 1 and to a lesser degree 2 and of course 2 reloaded with some old gov as a terminator. Well the answer i came up with was sort of. Should i pick the film apart from the football field size plot holes which have all been discussed here. I.E if i were sky-net i would make a couple more robots in one of my major production facilities to maybe kill humans if they some how climb in through the front door etc etc. or should i just enjoy the film loud in full surround with stuff blowing up everywhere and some good special effects thrown in for good measure (except glassy eyed Arnie T-800) Well i guess i enjoy both, there are many independent cinemas out there showing wonderful and confronting stories of old and new for my creative and analytical mind to watch. There are also many multiplexes out there with gigantic screens, insane sound systems and films with enough brain numbing SFX sequences to keep me coming back grabbing my medium popcorn and munching on some not so good for my smarts film<br/><br/>all in all i had a good time with Terminator Salvation, as long as i don't think too hard about it."

","Finally – we got to see “The Future” of the terminator franchise and to tell you frankly – I think the flashback from the T1 and T2 tell you a whole lot more than this movie. Though this ain’t that bad of movie but seriously, the story and the plots are just plain and lifeless. <br/><br/>For me this would have been just another man versus cyborg flick if it weren’t for the Terminator name. There isn’t much of anything really that make this movie to think about, but more of the question that came after having seen it. The story ain’t that confusing but there is a whole lot more explanation to do in the next film because this film didn’t quite make much sense. Don’t seem like a vital point of the “future” to be told but letting us know that John rescue his father.<br/><br/>The tone of the film change quite a lot from the original since almost every scene is shot in the broad day light and in the desert, taking away a lot of darkness of the movie in my account. Remind me of Resident Evil: Apocalypse. But at least they explain why every battle has to fight in daylight.<br/><br/>Anyway I thought the movie started out pretty alright, I like the part when John fought with T-600, and the score when well with the timing, but after that it felt so ordinary. As for the casting, I thought many of them didn’t quite do the job, C. Bale was not much of a John Conner, Sam was OK – but not so convincing Terminator, Bryce didn’t do anything at all, I think only Anton is only the only one to look out for. Also it was accompany by the weird and wooden dialogue and awkward situation. But apart from that McG did quite alright with his direction skill.<br/><br/>Beside from complains (mostly on how the story developed – I don’t really care how much error it made) the movie is more or less fun to watch. There are load of action sequence – involve almost everything man vs. man, man vs. Terminator, Terminator vs. Terminator and so on.<br/><br/>Oh and almost forget – the CGI is actually pretty good over here, Arnold face tracing technology is pretty darn convincing (though for few moment), but I’m impress.<br/><br/>Overall it would be pretty alright if you watch the movie for what it is, but if you’re a hardcore fan of the franchise (then you would have known that it was over with T2 – J. Cameron said it himself) you would be more on the disappointed side. <br/><br/>Season To Watch: It is “The Future”, we always wanted to see what the future is like!!!<br/><br/>Reason Not To: Judgment day don’t really existed, it was save in T2.<br/><br/>Rating: 6/10 (Grade: C+)"

","As a Terminator fan, I am divided. On one hand, it was undeniably pulse-quickening to finally witness the full rage of the war against the machines depicted with such brutal intensity. The action and the effects were just spectacular, and even though the design of the new robots obviously borrowed from other movies such as Matrix and Transformers, they were still pretty cool. Full marks to McG for the visuals and the direction of the action sequences. But on the other hand, I could not possibly forgive the veritable avalanche of trailer-truck-sized plot holes, which not only disrupt the internal logic of the film itself, but also severely contradict the previous films of the saga, particularly the first one, so close to my heart. Therefore, even though I really wanted to like it, ultimately I cannot approve this installment. Others not as concerned with the canon as myself might not be so bothered..."
"greenpower","6","0","1","12 June 2009"," Enjoyable movie ... if you don't think about it too much.
","This is my second review in IMDb. The first one was on Indiana Jones 4 (what a let down) so you can already guess how disappointed I am with the new Terminator sequel (also the 4th installment curiously or not)<br/><br/>The bottom line is that this movie fails to deliver to the most demanding fans in some of its aspects. Let me first summarize the good and the bad: Effects: Very Good (faces, robots, explosions, flying vehicles. Good job ILM!) Directing: Good (Refereshing new perspectives given at some shots e.g. the first helicopter scene is astonishing) Acting: Average to Good Script: Mediocre to Average Sound: Average Music: Average<br/><br/>As many reviews already talk about the effects and the actors performance I'll discuss what I think is the biggest problem with this movie: the script/plot<br/><br/>(Spoilers ahead) There are many issues already identified but I'll stick with what I think is the central flaw of the movie plot logic. Stay with me.<br/><br/>#1 How does Skynet knows Kyle Reese is John Conner's Father? (Solved): Skynet does indeed know that. Confirmed by McG himself in Screenrant/MTV ""T4 Plot Hole"" interview. #2 Why does not Skynet kill Kyle Reese at first opportunity if he's so important to John and all mankind's hope and just decides to use him as bait to lure John Conner to the base? And if Kyle is the key for the future of Mankind why hasn't John tried to find him earlier? (Not Solved) #3 A: From Skynet perspective: John seems to be far a more important target than Kyle. Skynet knows about this but John fails to understand that by putting his life in jeopardy to rescue Kyle? (the sentient AI is more intelligent than the human plot thing?) #3 B: From John Conner perspective: Kyle is the key for mankind's hope so he decides to put an halt to the entire human plan to destroy the skynet base at last minute to rescue Kyle. But what is the main reason Kyle is so important that John is so desperate to set him free anyway? Could it be that if Kyle dies than he (John) dies also (automatically?) since Kyle is his father and so John dies? And bye-bye to the only guy that could save mankind? If this hypothesis is correct and you're agreeing with it than why does not Skynet just kill Kyle Reese in the first place. I just don't get it. 4# The only plausible explanation I can think of to sort this apparent plot hole, but way out there, is that from Skynet perspective it would not be sufficient to kill Kyle and it needed both the ""Father"" and the ""Son"" to end the thing once and for all for good. Kyle would not return to the past to generate John (for an alternative parallel universe) and the great John Conner of the present would die also (in this time-line universe) which would end the war right there in full favor for Skynet. This expeculation of mine cannot be proved, I mean why killing Kyle would not be sufficient? On the other hand the only hope for John Conner would be to take both their asses out of the Skynet complex alive so that he can send Kyle back to be his ""Father"" (again) for a happy ""alternative"" universe. Why risk John's neck in the first place if humans would at least win in the current timeline?<br/><br/>This sort of mess happens because time travel paradoxes cannot be understood and because they are, most likely, not possible/real in a first place. This is only a film, but plot holes tend to ruin films and entire franchises to hardcore fans due to bad story telling (look what happened to the Matrix franchise with the third installment).<br/><br/>I'm not saying the movie is bad I'm just saying to please make movies that tell a coherent story that we can ""buy"". This is a lesson to T5, please learn."

","Great Effects, Nice Action, Decent Acting, and pretty awesome feel while watching, go see it.<br/><br/>This Contains as Much Spoilers as the Trailers.There For Blame them.<br/><br/>I am a Big fan of the original Terminator Movies, and was so excited when they announced that they where going to show the future they warn us about. But...... They had to take a lot into consideration. In the story (although not really mentioned in the movie) from all the failed attempts to stop John Connor from being conceived/born, then assassination at age 14. As Well as the Marcus Wright signing over his body to Cyberdyne in 2003. It Managed to make Skynet, Speed up, and create the beloved T-1000 Terminator Models (With Human Similarities) Which is what Schwarzenegger was. So they Used that and then made the movie set in 2018, instead of 2029 where we were warned about before.<br/><br/>But My biggest Problem was with Psychological Issues with The connection between John Connor, and Kyle Reese (John's Father) Who was about 18 Years old in the film. This is a few years before he is sent back to 1984 to tell Sarah That she is the Mother of John Connor, and we later find out he is the father of John. The Problem is that John in 2018 Knows That Kyle is his father, and attempts to save him and keep him alive remembering ""This is the Man that Bang's my mother"". Honestly How Could you stay serious while trying to save a man that in a few months is going to have sex with his mom. And then be the one to send him back.... I think John would need therapy.<br/><br/>SERIOUSLY! WATCH IT IF YOU LIKED THE ORIGINAL OR JUST LOOKING FOR ACTION. It won't make as much sense if you don't know the first film, but trust me, even that couldn't really save the plot."

","It is very difficult to properly evaluate the fourth part, but it is definitely NOT the good old Arnie' s vehicle- he does pop up for a brief moment though! - and one of the essential Sci-fi movies ever . Its brightest side is undoubtedly the scenery ,i.e. the movie takes place in the future when the nuclear war has devastated almost everything, and more or less unconnected bands of humans are roaming this radioactive wasteland in the veritable Mad Max fashion , thus becoming easy prey for all kinds of robotic enemies , from very flexible ˝ biker ˝ ones , to some sort of nasty looking quasi-fish entities ,to 'HQs' and my favorite ones , namely giant human harvesters. But , and this is its main flaw, you barely get to see the standard T-800, and only one T-600 that soon gets hilariously whacked off , and where are the waves of aforementioned T-800s that we are so familiar with from previous installments anyway ? And , secondly, humans have not fared so poorly , possessing choppers , Thunderbolt planes, an intact and quite a modern and fully operational airport and ,yes, even a sub ,acting as their headquarters! Nuclear destruction would look much more thorough and terrifying, as is depicted in other Terminators! Acting is rather average, and the only one standing out is H.B. Carter as a Cyberdine-Skynet scientist with a secret , and if there is to be a sequel to this , I expect her in a leading role!Briefly, visually stunning , thanks to ILM and Stan Winston Studios, otherwise too much Sarah Connor Chronicles , it should have been branded 18 , as this is NOT your standard Saturday afternoon TV fare!<br/><br/>!"

"ladyophelia101-1","5","0","2","8 June 2009"," A Terminator by Any Other Name or Milking the Cash Cow
","A few thoughts before going ahead with this Terminator Salvation review I hated T3... With a fiery vengeance. I hate the fact that the writers disregarded timeline stuff from the first two movies, and generally thought the writing was plain lazy. But the ending took me by surprise. Nothing about Terminator Salvation will take you by surprise. The future that Terminator Salvation shows us is disappointing. It looks not nearly as horrific as the first movie was able to make it look (at a fraction of the budget of this movie). And John Connor? Not only is he not the leader of the resistance but he's not even the lead in this movie. He's very much a side character. We see him doing stuff but the story isn't even about him. Bryce Dallas Howard is plainly wasted in this movie. Unless you recently watched the third movie, you may not even have a clue who she's supposed to be. <br/><br/>Instead Terminator Salvation focuses on a teenage Kyle Reese- a fact that is forced on the audience by the movie airing the tape that Sarah records at the very end of the movie- except that it isn't the same recording. Instead it's re-recorded with a line that's not in the original, emphasizing that Kyle is a teenager. I might also add that these re-recorded tapes have not even one tenth of the emotion that James Cameron was able to create. So how do they explain the altered tapes? Well, actually, they don't, which again stinks of lazy writing. The movie follows Reese as he is suddenly pursued by Terminators. Why? Because he's the number one most wanted. But how could that be? There's absolutely no record of Kyle Reese being related to John Connor. More lazy writing. <br/><br/>The other major character focus is named Marcus played by Sam Worthington, a man who finds out he's really a machine. A fact which is mentioned in the very first scene of the movie. Marcus' story pretty much is along the lines of a man who thinks he's still a man, only to find out he's a machine and is saved (with very little explanation) by a woman who has most likely spent her life fighting the machines. I won't reveal any other ""spoilers"" except to see that if you are even half awake during the movie, you'll have guessed most of the plot before it even happens. <br/><br/>So what can I say that was good? Very little actually. It wasn't a terrible movie exactly, it just didn't really engage me. Sure there were some interesting Terminators, but too many plot holes. Why would John waste his ammo shooting a Terminator when he knows that his little hand gun won't do any good? And why does a Terminator-bike have a set up so that a human can ride it? <br/><br/>Overall this movie leaves me with a feeling of ""what's the point?""? Like a lot of useless reboots and sequels lately (I'm talking to you, Star Trek!) I didn't feel like there was any point to this movie. I didn't need to see a young Kyle Reese, and frankly, Michael Biehn's Kyle Reese gave us enough tantalizing descriptions that I didn't need to see the Future War either. Whilst James Cameron's first two movies gave us exciting movies with groundbreaking special effects it also gave us thoughts about the future, about nuclear war, and about love. This movie had none of those things going for it. This one was just milking the cash cow. Read more reviews at Inter-Galaxy Portal."
"Red_Flag","4","0","2","8 June 2009"," Hasta La Vista Baby
","He promised he'd be back, and four movies on the Terminator franchise is starting to look rusty. Will it be worth going back for another look into the future, or is it hasta la vista baby for this series? From what we saw in the trailer it's clear that this isn't your average Terminator movies. While the first three were primarily chase movies in which our protagonists were forced to escape and oncoming Terminator. Here it's a full frontal battle movie, everything you remember from the opening sequence of the original movies with the grown John Conner, that is this movie. With one major difference. The originals gave us a sense of envy, Conner was a person given little screen time, very screen time we longed for. Here were given it and I almost feel selfish in saying, we really didn't need this. Bale is the main problem, as much as I love Batman, I feel erroneous to even be saying this but, Christian Bale is atrocious in this movie. It's almost as if it's Bale playing Batman playing John Conner, his excessive tone that makes the movie hard to take serious, even for a Terminator film.<br/><br/>Call me jaded but the reason the first films work so wells is because of their pacing, they create a sense of pathos to begin with only to release hell upon our protagonists, and here the pace is near gone. Playing like your average video game rip off its nothing more than one looming set piece to the other. Don't get me wrong the film looks incredible and McG creates a formidable vision of the future with survival the main priority. Unfortunately any sense of trepidation is tarnished by dreadful one lines that feel out of place in the grand scheme of things, the supporting cast do an admirable job of keeping the foundations of the film upright, Sam Worthington giving and impressive attempt and managing to resonate where other do not, if I didn't know any better I would have had him take Bales place as Conner, but that's just me.Though competent in its B-movie way, Terminator Salvation lacks the humour, heart-tugging moments and visual pleasure that made the first two movies of the series modern pop masterpieces.<br/><br/>Set in post-apocalyptic 2018, John Connor is the man fated to lead the human resistance against Skynet and its army of Terminators. But the future Connor was raised to believe in is altered in part by the appearance of Marcus Wright, a stranger whose last memory is of being on death row. Connor must decide whether Marcus has been sent from the future, or rescued from the past. As Skynet prepares its final onslaught, Connor and Marcus both embark on an odyssey that takes them into the heart of Skynet's operations, where they uncover the terrible secret behind the possible annihilation of mankind. The story is typical fare, including several Terminator time-loops that give the film purpose but no real goal. With no antagonist to fear the film feels pointless, and with a protagonist that you're unable to relate to it acts emotionless. Untimely leading to an unbalanced film. Granted this is a film director by McG, (Charlie's Angels) and for a McG film you get everything you're expected to, the battle scenes are exciting and stimulating while the final 20 minutes a untouchable run that acts as the films strongest point. None of which really matter when taken into context. Sure we get to see everything we came there to see but It all happens in the last 20 minutes and trust me it's a long excruciating wait tarnished with disastrous plot holes, some of the worst dialogue of the summer and character that are so underdeveloped that it would shame that of ""Wolverine"" Change was inevitable—the established Terminator formula has been squeezed dry in FOX's prime-time The Sarah Conner Chronicles. But among the many things junked in McG's chop-shop is the notion of pleasure: The director describes cutting that ""gratuitous moment of a girl taking her top off in an action picture"" (God forbid) to get a franchise-first PG-13. He does, however, begin his film with the hook of Worthington clammily kissing a vampire-complexioned, bald-pated Helena Bonham Carter. Bale, doing the ""Grrr"" voice, is a lesson in how clenched effort does not equal effect. What's remarkable about his leaked freakout—mostly embarrassing in revealing a director who can't Alpha up on his set—is that it's over a performance in McG's ""Terminator Salvation."" Did the dude sweat this much over Reign of Fire? Verdict: Stylish but shallow, action-packed but without ever being exciting, Terminator Salvation is a movie that looked amazing as a trailer, but doesn't stand up as a 115 minute film. Bales performance is one note and shockingly dismal and it's obvious that this Terminator is showing some rust. The movie suffers from an inevitable tedium, which can best be summarized as: bang-bang-bang; pow, pow; fireball, fireball; ka-boom! It neither adds to nor subtracts from the mythology. And with Judgment Day upon us, there's no more tension, nothing compelling left to explore. By the time Arnie shows up your mind is already made up. For my overall review I give Terminator Salvation 2/5."
"TheHande","6","0","1","8 June 2009"," Okay action flick, but less than I expected...
","With Terminator Salvation the film franchise now moves away from time-travel to deal with the battle with the machines from the more relevant viewpoint. While the post-apocalyptic world of the fourth Terminator movie has its charm it wears out quickly after which we're left with a very standard type of action movie.<br/><br/>The character of Marcus Wright was clearly the focus of the film and while he was interesting enough on his own as the film reaches its final act it begins to dawn that he is in the movie to serve a very obvious purpose. Neither John Connor nor Kyle Reese stand out as great characters. Christian Bale and Anton Yelchin have faces fit for big action-movies but as characters they unfortunately fall to the sidelines.<br/><br/>Aside the action-scenes the most fun I had while watching the movie was spotting references to the old Terminator movies. The problem with this is also the main problem of the film itself, it's not the first tree movies. I'm a fan of the first one so it's hard to be objective but certainly this movie didn't exceed its excellence. The second one isn't my favorite but I thought it and the third movie out shined this one for over-all entertainment value.<br/><br/>Terminator Salvation is definitely a good movie on its own but as a continuation of the legacy of the Terminator film-series it falls short of its predecessors and becomes just another chapter, not an epic."
"richnieh","6","0","2","8 June 2009"," Above average movie at best.
","It has been a long wait for me for this movie and as successful as its predecessors, I believe his movie had earned a lot of fan base. Now, I have to say I feel disappointed with this movie. Don't get me wrong, it is a good movie with a lot of actions. However, that is about it. The actors did a OK job but the movie did not provide them a lot of material to act. The special effect was brilliant but so as a lot of other Hollywood action/fiction movies. We all know what we are looking for is not the great acting and the so many movies possess great special effect and honest to say, it is getting old.<br/><br/>I don't think the acting job in TDK was as good as everyone says other than Heath Ledger's joker. Its special effect is great but it is just easier to show off when you have big robots running around. However, TDK is so much more enjoyable than T4. The main reason is the storyline. T4's storyline is very poor. It is OK to assume everyone coming to watch the movie already know the story but there are some details still need to be explained. I am not going to give spoilers but it has been long time I think the movie was too short. It simply focused on the actions too much and the whole movie was not only rushed. They were messy and confusing at some point. Well, the whole story was probably too simple to get confused but writers can do a lot more to make this movie much more enjoyable.<br/><br/>In terminator 1 and 2, actions and special effect was top of the league back in their time, but most importantly, the story was attractive and viewers wanted to see the end and feel touched. T3 loses the touch and basically loses originality as well. T4 creates a new era for terminator series but the story was just too poorly construct. The focus on the movie was wrong, at least for me, I went to cinema to watch the story involving with the robots, not the robots.<br/><br/>The movie had no urgency, no thrill, little excitement because of all the money invested in the special effect. It is sad to say, merely above average movie. I hope T5, T6 will take my advice and contains a much better story or I don't see this successful series continues its success any more."

Why would that terminator not kill him right off, just twist Connors head off, or rip his heart out like the terminator in Camerons The Terminator? Why would Skynet explain all to Marcus the hybrid, just to irritate and agitate him, when he had served his purpose?

","OK! Where do I start, and my inability to provide a starting point should give you some idea of this film. I had hoped for so much after the farce that was Terminator 3, unfortunately it never materialised. It will go down in history for me as one of those films that had all the best bits in the trailer! Let's look at one significant part of the film, it is obvious by the end of the film that the Resistance have yet to perfect the ability or know how to send a Terminator (I'll called them T or T's from now on) back to prevent the killing of John Connor's mother or indeed John Connor himself. I might add here that I wish he had done at the end of T-2 then we wouldn't have been privy to Christian Bale's performance, I was unsure if he was the right choice when it surfaced he would get the JC role, his portrayal proved it. Now I agree it is a hard, complex role to cast but for me it was just Bruce Wayne without the cheesy voice and complete lack of personality. As such and in tune with The Dark Knight he was blown off the screen by a supporting cast member, just as Heath Ledger took the credit there, Sam Worthington (aka Marcus) stole the show here. Anyway back to my point, remember I said they haven't yet realised the ability to send Terminators back, and if you cast your mind back to the end of T-2, ""Arnie's"" T killed himself by lowering himself into a vat of molten metal. Therefore in the fight scene with ""Arnie"", (for me a cheesy throwback and homage to the first two films) toward the end of this scene, when he is smothered again in molten metal he survives and continues to chase JC. A mistake if ever there was one, surely these T's are not as technologically advanced, a fact enforced with the lack of T-1000's as in T-2 and T-3. Then we have the surly media broadcasts by JC, what a farce, it mentions at the start that he may be a ""false"" hope yet everyone believes in him, no detractors and no challengers to his so called leadership. The film takes too long to get going, given SKYNETS dominance JC manages to infiltrate their headquarters far too easily, only for us to be told in a final ""speech"" that the war carries on??? So it wasn't the HQ then? Or was it? Anyway we now know it has been left open for another film, unfortunately! I thought this one would make up for the ludicrous T-3, it was better I will say that but James Cameron will either be sat there laughing saying that's why I stopped at T-2, or crying in disbelief at what they have done to his creation. Kate Connor spends the film remaining totally clean, well groomed and in perfect makeup, she obviously had secret knowledge of the only mall that had survived and had an endless supply of Max Factor – Moon Goodblood did well as Blair and Anton Yelchin gave a creditable performance as Kyle. The action takes a while to get going but when it does it is well paced and dramatic – as you would expect – but overall I must say I was hugely disappointed, the potential was there to make an absolute blockbuster, what they have done is created another weak film in the franchise. But money talks and I am sure T-5 will be there surely because it will bring in money"

","As a fan of the Terminator series I was extremely interested to see this film, even though I was disappointed that they were going to do a terminator movie without Arnold being the lead. He IS The Terminator, and no man can replace him. Then they revealed that Christian ""Hey I'm in every damn movie they make these days"" Bale was going to be John Connor. What was wrong with Nick Stahl? Okay, maybe he lacks the charisma and character to play the harsh military leader that Connor should be, but why did they have to pick Bale? And yeah, he tried to speak with this weird voice that just remained me of the ridiculous voice of the new Batman. I mean, Bale doesn't have this stupid voice in real life, so why to include it in this film also? <br/><br/>But yeah, the action is good, even though it was much more CGI than it was in the earlier movies, which made it stale. I felt like watching a new Transformers flick, where there really is no breaks from the action, which really hurts the story. I think they could have had a great story involving the questions of what is humanity and what differs us from the machine, but instead we had all this CGI-action, which really was not as awesome as it was in T3 for example. Also a BIG minus for them to spoil and exploit one of the only twists in this movie in all the trailers. WHY did they do it? I just can't understand.<br/><br/>Other thing that I find very stupid is the amount of different terminators. There were at least 7 different type of terminators roaming around, and for some reason it reminded me of Pokémon. You know, gotta catch em' all and stuff like that. In the previous films, there were just T800's and the larger war-machines in the future, and then the special liquid types, put in this future there were terminator robots that made no god damn sense. And the weapons... where were the laser rifles and all that cool stuff they showed us in the little flashbacks (and forwards) of the previous movies? No, they were not there.<br/><br/>Actually the entire feeling of despair that was present in the flashbacks of the first movie is not there. They were not fighting for their lives every goddamn second as they should have been. It feels like the resistance is kicking ass with nearly zero casualties. That is the mood of this film. It is not as dark and desperate as it should have been, and that is a great minus. It does not make you care for their fight, as really it feels like Skynet is the weaker one.<br/><br/>Now I would have rated this 5/10 without the few little - but still so awesome - tributes to the previous movies. They made me cheer in the theater.<br/><br/>And you got to give bonus for Anton Yelchin. I thought this kid was crap because of his bad work in Star Trek, but he was actually the best actor in this entire movie.<br/><br/>If you want brainless action like Tranformers, go watch this movie. If you want great action AND awesome story like the first and second movie, stay away. I think the now-canceled TV-series Sarah Connor Chronicles was much better than this for a Terminator fan."
"stephen_cage","5","0","1","6 June 2009"," Terminator Salvation
","In Terminator Salvation; the usual plot guidelines which followed T1, T2 and T3 are put completely put to one side, and instead, the story revolves around the fight against the machines (terminators) that is only briefly described in the other three films. Though incredibly impressive on the eyes, with what feels like multiple explosions every five minuets, the films seems to lack any of the charm and brilliance of what Terminator 1 offered, or indeed T2 or T3.<br/><br/>Though the picture does contain the occasional plot twist to keep you entertained (especially towards the finale) but seems very lacking in depth in terms of plot advancement, and tends to only bring the story forward in action sequences rather than dialogue. Another irritating aspect is that although T1 and T2 may feel dated in terms of effects, they both still contain exciting and suspenseful story lines and action scenes. Though Terminator Salvation offers incredible special effects, the action itself is dull and lacks some kind of... umph... which the others managed to keep.<br/><br/>On the brighter side however, there's some good dramatic acting from Sam Worthington, who plays resistance soldier Marcus Wright. This especially brought to light towards the centre of the film in an interesting subtle plot twist. Saddly, this moment is overshadowed at the end with some nice sickly cheesy quotes as the helicopters fly of into sunset being what seems like and endless stream of explosions... ahh well.<br/><br/>All in all, Terminator Salvations potentially could have a lot to offer, if only it had a more resolute plot which griped viewers more, rather than leave them to goggle at the many explosions TS has to offer. I would not bother wasting your time and money on a film such as Terminator Salvation; even X-Men Origins - Wolverine is more watchable."
"killsomeone","4","0","2","6 June 2009"," No fate but what MCG makes
","With the legacy of the original terminator trilogy to uphold, everyone knew this was no easy task. Unfortunately, everyone was right.<br/><br/>I felt this film lacked something. That something was the fact it felt like it wasn't a sequel to the other terminators, it was a completely different film, adapted from the basic original idea. This may be the goal MCG was striving to achieve, to re-invent the franchise, to give it a new start, new life, but i felt it was redone to extremes. New terminators, vehicles and characters make up this film. From ridiculous ""flying saucer"" terminators to a John Connor that has no resemblance to anything we or James Cameron would invision, i feel the franchise has not been redone, but terminated.<br/><br/>Many new characters, that have little overall importance at all, take up valuable screen time we could be watching of plot holes being filled in or breathtaking non-cgi stunts. There is one example i would like to highlight. The character of the commander, safe in his submarine has little or no importance to anything, you feel like you want some money back just for seeing him on screen.<br/><br/>Unfilled plot holes crater this film. I feel many of the decent ideas put forward are not explained or revealed at all, they are just simply forgotten about. Also there is no resemblance to the original future, invisioned by James Cameron and co, but a dreary dull grey cityscape to ruin your hopes of the neon blue warfare of the classic films.<br/><br/>I feel also that the film has very little strings for a sequel to attatch to, it just seems to end, taking with it the all secrets you want to know. I think the script feels rushed, like they sat down and said ""war"" ""big stunts"" ""new ideas"" ""trilogy"" and had to scrabble something together quick. It feels like nothing was properly thought through, that there is no story, just a tale of what happens in the future.<br/><br/>To the credit of the film, i thought a few ideas were great, they were on the right tracks, but much CGI and classic Hollywood ""tough war-voices"" ruined it for me. I loved some of the new machines, but again they looked shabby due to lazy CGI. Even some key bare metal terminator scenes are done with rather crumby CGI which ruins the tension and interest of the moment, leaving you unastounded. Action films like this are made to leave you astounded, jaw-dropped, scared sh**less. Unfortunately i only felt this once in the entire film and that was right at the start, which made you want more. Unfortunately there was no more to come and you will leave feeling bitter.<br/><br/>I have loved the Terminator franchise since i saw them when i was a small boy, and i have looked forward to this film from the second i left the cinema of Terminator 3. I feel 6 long years of excitement and anticipation were evaporated in Terminator Salvation. I don't feel anger, pity or remorse by seeing this film, i just feel disappointed."
"theatrejake","6","0","1","5 June 2009"," Hollywood: Make movies, please, not franchises.
","There is no ""may contain"" - here be spoilers aplenty!<br/><br/>Looking beyond the abilities of McG, Christian Bale, and others who helped make this film possible, the major flaw is not the movie itself- it is our new passion for franchises, not films. For those who have seen this latest installment, ask yourself what kind of movie this could have been if they would have ended it without leaving room for sequels.<br/><br/>Time travel movies allow filmmakers to play around with the story so that you can see what happens at the end before the beginning if you like. In the Terminator world, we knew how it ends in the first movie - Reese says that the resistance wins, they'd crushed Skynet. Killing Connor in the future doesn't matter, so they send machines back to destroy him via his mother. So we know where we are heading. The last scene in the Terminator franchise should be sending Kyle through the time machine.<br/><br/>But if we do that at the end of this movie, it's all over, no more films. And we all know that to run a franchise into the ground, we need at least 2 or 3 really bad box office returns for sequels before we're giving up on it. No wonder Cameron said he was through - I'm surprised he did a second one, really.<br/><br/>We end this movie with Connor ""still fighting the resistance""? Good thing he added that Skynet is global, so there's more work to do. But Ironside says we destroy Skynet, the war is over. I guess he needed to say ""the war is over (in California)."" Why not cut out the really bad ending (and the equally bad alternate ending- A Connor suit? No thanks) and write a movie that is a true homage to the first ones. Make it cyclic. And do it in one movie. It's possible, really. In fact, the end and the beginning of the franchise was already written in the first movie. All you have to do is fill in the middle. <br/><br/>That being said, if they make more, I'll see them. If not in the theaters, eventually. So instead of paying for one, I will have to pay for 2 or more. It's sad that we can't just make one movie anymore."
"paul_vromen","6","0","1","5 June 2009"," Decent looking, lacks punch
","Like many other it seems, I did not have stellar expectations of this fourth outing in the Terminator franchise. The first two films, each in their own way, are cutting-edge sci-fi blockbusters which have set a standard for this series that has not been met since.<br/><br/>The problem with this fourth movie is that it seemingly lacks the sense of urgency that made the first two films (especially the first one) so great. Sure director McG has played around with the style of the film, as he comes up with exquisitely shot action scenes and a very convincing post-apocalyptic depiction of L.A.. But even though these elements are in place, and the film itself looks suitably worn (McG apparently left the film reels to deteriorate in the sun for said effect), it doesn't give off the feeling that the stakes are high.<br/><br/>The last act of the film is plagued by typical Hollywood clichés. Even though the final action scene is still mildly engaging, it never becomes ""edge of your seat"" material.<br/><br/>The dialogue isn't anything stellar either, and the cherished references to the older films are a bit too forced for my liking. That said, the acting is mostly OK. Sam Worthington does a great job of portraying Marcus Wright, however, and easily outperforms Bale who resorts to his usual tough-guy shtick.<br/><br/>As a summer action flick this is decent stuff, even though fans will probably be left wanting."

In fact this actually makes terminator 3 seem awesome. Christian Bale as an actor has got a lot more roles than he deserves in my opinion & this being one of them. Highlight of the movie was definitely Sam Worthington as Marcus Wright, personally i think his was by far the best performance throughout the whole feature. My ranking for this is 6.5 /10.

","In a desolate future overrun with killer robots, two men fight separate battles. One of them has a mysterious destiny, and the other has a mysterious past...<br/><br/>Dreadful dialogue, too many war movie clichés, a lack of story and a boring visual style drag this one down towards mediocrity. But there are things to enjoy. There are a couple of good performances, a couple of good action sequences and - if you forget the first two Terminator movies - you will enjoy this fast-moving summer blockbuster.<br/><br/>The movie opens with stirring lines like ""it's too quiet"" and ""don't point a gun unless you intend to use it"" and continues in that vein for two hours. You are better off not listening when the characters speak because it will make you laugh. So will many of the set-ups and situations. The hero has a hard ass commanding officer who ignores him and reprimands him, there's a mute child running around looking alternatively cute/scared, there's a woman who lays it all on the line for true love, there's a big sacrifice at the end and stuff like that.<br/><br/>Story-wise the split narrative does a great job of keeping the viewer interested. When the Christian Bale storyline gets boring (as it frequently does), the tale returns to Sam Worthington and we are interested again. Worthington has a better story, a better character and gives a much better performance. Bale is relentlessly boring and his character does nothing. He spends a lot of time sitting brooding (while listening to his mother's voice on cassette) and when he does make decisions they are frustratingly bad ones. This is John Connor, huh? Since 1984 we have been told of this great leader. The writers appear to have forgotten that fact or are incapable of delivering a script that will demonstrate his abilities. A hero who sits for hours squinting at a tape recorder and then runs full tilt into a trap does not inspire confidence. Idiot.<br/><br/>Then there is the greyness of everything. Everything is grey and dusty in this movie. Even flickering flames appear to be grey! It's all a bit much.<br/><br/>Worthington and Moon Bloodgood are the highlights of the film. Both have interesting characters to play. Yes, their story arcs are predictable, but - thanks to the performances - I cared and enjoyed. In fact, had this been their story (with no reference to Terminator/John Connor) this would have been a much more enjoyable film.<br/><br/>In terms of actions there is lots to enjoy. Killer robots (small, medium and large) run rampant, there are chases on the land and in the air, and there are fights in the water, in the dusty grime and in sleek futuristic hallways. There isn't much downtime between action sequences and McG manages to put a neat visual twist on a couple of them (I really like the helicopter crash).<br/><br/>Even with all the stuff that was bad/awful/disappointing I can honestly say I enjoyed the film as a whole. It's not epic like former Terminator movies, and it's not clever/deep like the TV series, but it's not an entirely bad way to spend two hours if you like to see things blowing up.<br/><br/>Grade: B http://yetanotherfilmreviewblog.blogspot.com"
"johnnyboyz","5","0","2","5 June 2009"," Disappointing and somewhat underwhelming addition to a franchise that many, though excluding myself, exclaimed was dead anyway.
","I think a certain degree of trepidation hit everyone when it was announced the director of the two Charlie's Angels films would be at the helm for a PG-13 (12A in Britain) Terminator film that was going to go down new roads and take place in the future, during the actual war between man and machine. It has since come to my attention that the writers of this project worked on the 2004 film Catwoman, which should really be a further nail in the coffin before you've even walked in. I do not think Terminator Salvation is quite as bad as either of these prior projects, which suggests a certain progression in both the filmmakers and writers' body of work, but all that counts for just about nothing when we realise this is the Terminator franchise we're talking about here, and whoever's decision it was to opt for these people to execute these ideas, must now come to terms with the fact it was a bad one.<br/><br/>If you know anything about the Terminator films, you'll know it is all about bodies – hard bodied cyborgs learning to become more humane and learning the values of human life; twinned with the soft bodied, deliberately introduced as rather pathetic, everyday-woman who learns of her fate and hardens up to become a fighter; a soldier and a mother. They are additionally about the coming to terms with technology and modernity co-existing in our contemporary world, and the struggles we face in being able to control what is essentially an arms race as these weapons are developed and developed some more. This addition, sadly, lacks any continuation of said study.<br/><br/>Terminator Salvation is a bad film, those that say otherwise are, I think, allowing the fact it's a Temrinator film complete with a few mildly interesting action scenes, to blind them somewhat. But it's that 'annoying' bad you sometimes get with projects you go in really wanting to like. Some may even compare the experience to 1999's Episode 1 of the Star Wars saga. Initially, Terminator Salvation is told on two separate equilibriums. The first sees a cold-blooded criminal named Marcus Wright (Worthington) sign away his body to Cyberdyne Systems prior to execution, in 2003. Upon the happening of Judgment Day and the resurrection of Marcus, complete with his half human-half robotic body, he bumps into a young Kyle Reese, played by a Russian actor named Anton Yelchin. Events transpire that put Reese in mortal danger and force Marcus into meeting up with the man of the hour; the supposed saviour: John Connor (Bale).<br/><br/>Prior to all this, Connor is heading various missions with members of the resistance in fully fuelled choppers and jet aircrafts; the sort that sees a few members die here and there, but nobody particularly important. Connor lives with a few significant members of the resistance; his wife Kate (Dallas Howard); an African-American soldier named Barnes (Common) and a feisty young woman whose study of a hard-bodied female soldier sees her glow on the screen, clad in a zip up tracksuit, whilst submitting to male charm in a false and disappointing manner that is crudely fast-tracked when a male agent saves her from potential rape. Her name is Blair Williams (Bloodgood).<br/><br/>Director McG's heart isn't with this project. It seems we've come to a point in which entire projects are re-written and changed just prior to production because certain story developments and ideas are 'leaked' to the rest of the world. This is not an individual's vision; it is a studio's vision to deliver an experience that no one is expecting – and when people are expecting it, it is removed and changed and re-submitted; for sake people might not pay their money if they know what will transpire. The film attempts to open up a plot that the humans hope will culminate in the destruction of the machines; a plan that revolves around the idea that ""Every machine has an off switch, let's find Skynet's"". This is introduced by a certain General Ashdown (Ironside), a man that states, after finding a low frequency noise that deactivates the machines, that the humans can win this war with this tool. Trouble is, we all walk in knowing there are planned sequels so there is never really any tension as to whether this plan will work – clearly it won't, and sure enough, a development opens up towards the end that told me I was correct in my feeling vacant.<br/><br/>The final act is completely phoned in, what with a descent into the baddies' lair, crudely put across via lazy iconography consisting of towering, grey chimneys and large vents that inexplicably shoot out fireballs at random intervals. The film transpires into a pretty basic one-on-one showdown in which metal rods, electric cables and tanks of molten steel are readily available – McG has no awareness of space during these scenes and as a consequence, it is horridly put together. Getting there is a chore; McG rips off Spielberg's War of the Worlds with large, hulking, bleeping robots that collect humans in cages for selected further use but gives us a few new, if rather dull, Terminator motorcycles plus reconnaissance bots that look a bit like Frisbees. Where the franchise goes from here, I don't know. All that can be done is the documentation of how Kyle got sent back to 1984 or how the development and production of the T-1000 model came about. These ideas are nothing but mere visualisations of previously unseen events and will offer nothing bar a 'kick' as we see what we've never seen before effectively play out – I ask you: for what? The franchise may not be Terminated just yet, but it's on a bumpy old road to some sort of ruin."

But then imagine what it's like watching someone play it for two hours, not the worst experience in the world but certainly not hugely entertaining. Basically if you like watching your friends play Fallout 3 and Mortal Combat-style beat-em-ups then you will like watching Terminator Salvation. If you're looking for plot, reason or reality then you will be disappointed. I mean c'mon - a heart transplant in the middle of the California badlands in the open air with no tissue typing, no ICU - that's not stretching credibility, it's ripping it to shreds. Plus points?

"provenelk","6","0","2","3 June 2009"," Average at best but definitely unworthy
","First of all, i just wanted to say that McG is an awful director. What credit this film does have is tarnished by his amateur and naive style of film making. Pointlessly long shots, and horrible cuts ruin scenes that otherwise look great (special effects wise). I have a feeling that what ever crack pots at the studio were thinking when they hired this guy, they spat on the franchise, and especially the original 2 terminator films.<br/><br/>Aside from McSh*#t, the script is in places great, and in places awful. And the predictability and ""cheese"" of the plot is unforgivable, some parts made me cringe in my seat. This is largely the same with the sound editing. The aspect which defined Terminator 2 is also at times fantastic (the prisoner collector robots) but at times flacid and weak (no metallic/industrial sounds linked with the terminators).<br/><br/>Overall i think the worst point is that there's no definitive ""bad guy"" apart from really skynet itself. I can see what McShit was trying to do by not, but stuffing a terminator film full of messages instead of having a badass terminator is just pretentious.<br/><br/>On positive notes the special effects are amazing, and the action sequences are pretty fun and exciting. Also the acting is pretty much spot on, apart from Bloodmoon. The guy who plays Reese was surprisingly good.<br/><br/>Overall this film is average, but you cant shake the feeling that it was just an opportunity to cash in which becomes all too apparent in certain parts, and having just seen TS and coming home to find T2 on TV, really highlighted my feelings about this movie. I think if they Had attached a more experienced (and lets be honest not a crap one) director than maybe this film would have earnt its place in the franchise.<br/><br/>Worth watching?

John Connor (a super serious Christian Bale) is now in charge of the resistance, and a new breed of terminators built from combining humans with computers is under development.

Am I repeating myself? Thus the plot outlined in the four Terminator movies has finally come full circle (literally) like a dog chasing its tail.<br/><br/>""Salvation"" is flashy and well made, but there's also something humorless and dogged about it in comparison to the earlier movies. There's none of the tongue-in-cheek humor, and McG can't stage action scenes as well as James Cameron. There's lots of nifty special effects on display here, but nothing you haven't seen before. The actors don't seem to be having much fun, and the Terminators themselves don't play a very large role, which means the plot of this installment is much less compelling than its predecessors. It also easily has the cheesiest and dumbest ending of the series, or of any number of other movies I've seen recently, for that matter.<br/><br/>And for the life of me, I still can't figure out how John Connor ends up being older than his own dad, who he spends most of this film trying to protect.

SHE only believed in him.<br/><br/>SHE was in love with him, so she formulated a plan to help him escape. she let him go and they ran outside the hq, they were greeted by bullets and bombs. she was captured by john's men and dwight somehow escaped to the river. john went to him and they chitchatted. dwight convinced john that he knew reese, that he was taken by the terminators and locked in their hq. he promised him he would locate reese and help john get reese out from the skype, he could do that because he was a terminator himself, so it was easy for him to enter and manipulate skype. john let him go, giving him a device so they could contact each other.<br/><br/>dwight penetrated through skype, went to the master bedroom and the computer told him about what he was, how he was made, etc. he was made to be a terminator, something they (who the f are they) created to (what?) impress humans. he also learned that the signal they-john's team- found on one of skype's hqs was a custom-designed device meant to trace the main hq of human. at the same time of his acquiring the truth, the humans main hq was visited by a strong terminator and annihilated the place.<br/><br/>meanwhile, john was outside the skype waiting for dwight's text message as to where reese was. finally he received what he wanted and immediately entered skype using high-techniqued overriding device to open the gate. he managed to be invincible and reached the main building. dwight chose a path, either to be human or a machine, he chose to be the weaker form, human penetrated the mothercomputer and stopped some terminators, then smashed the screen with a table.<br/><br/>he went to search for john who was being battered by a terminator. john somehow managed to get away from the machine and went to free the prisoners, including reese. he found the nuclear-potions room and wired the chemicals with explosives. the machine reached him and they fought. he was about to be killed, thanks to dwight, he was able to put a fight with the machine until they killed it. they made it outside skype, the planes were waiting for them and they evacuated the place. set the explosives to fire and watched skype went to ashes.<br/><br/>reese was john's father, they stared at each other when they saw each one. his father was younger at that time, one of them was from another time, either john was from the future of reese was from the past.<br/><br/>john's heart was failing because of the injury he received from the fight with the terminator dwight offered his heart to john, stating that.

","Terminator Salvation has some of the ingredients for a real slam bang action flick, the outstanding production design, the creepy robots, and a director who does not rely on shaky cam (finally). I think the late Stan Winston would be proud of the endoskeleton designs. One of my friends said ""they're so creepy"" in the middle of the film. It begins on the right note, with a fantastic action scene that shows off the state of California after the nuclear war. John Connor uncovers the plans for the T-800, a welcome nod to the earlier films. The film is about two men, John Connor and a new character named Marcus Wright. Connor is not the leader of the resistance, at least not yet, but he has become a prophet of sorts with a large following due to his accurate predictions of what Skynet will do in the future. The human resistance has a new technology that could defeat Skynet for good. In the meantime, Marcus Wright awakens from a deep sleep. (Minor Spoiler from movie trailer up ahead) Anybody who saw the trailer knows Marcus is a cyborg who was not programmed to know he is a cyborg. His story is basically about him traveling California to figure out what the heck is going on. He has no knowledge of the war against the machines. His path crosses John Connor's after he befriends Connor's father, Kyle Reese, who has been captured by Skynet.<br/><br/>This doesn't sound like a bad plot, but unfortunately it does not generate enough excitement or suspense. It just seems to wander from scene to scene without much direction, but plenty of action. Salvation has some problems with its plot that are found in many action movies. I won't go into too much detail so as not to reveal spoilers, but they basically amount to the scenes in James Bond movies where the villain passes up a golden opportunity to kill James Bond just to deliver a monologue. Skynet's master villain scheme does not make any sense. The film also borrows from contemporary Spielberg films. I caught the Transformers connection but one of my friends noted a similarity to War of the Worlds. The Terminators carry prisoners to their camps in a sequence reminiscent of the scene from WOTW where Tom Cruise and his daughter were carried in the belly of that walking Alien vehicle. I thought a future war story would be a welcome change from the standard plot formula of the last two films, but it ends up being a bit of a routine in its own way.<br/><br/>What really killed the film for me though was the wooden characters. Christian Bale gives an intense action hero performance, but he did not have much to work with. John Connor is just a supporting character even though the series has always been about the Connor family. This might surprise or even confuse some. Sam Worthington gives a good performance as Marcus Wright, but he's just too much of a cliché for me to find him that interesting. I couldn't help but wonder ""why are we following this guy around?"" Maybe my Terminator fan boy bias made me more interested in John Connor. The original script for Salvation was all about Marcus Wright and Kyle Reese, and John Connor only had a minor role. Christian Bale was offered the role of Wright but he was more interested in John Connor, so the role was expanded. I can understand Bale's point. I don't think I would have liked the original concept for the film either, but once a creative tug-of-war begins it is usually a recipe for disaster unless the director has a clear vision of what he/she wants. Unfortunately I don't think McG was that director. The film doesn't seem to know who the main character is. In the final product, Marcus Wright and John Connor were not developed well enough. I don't think they even established who Bryce Dallas Howard's character was (Katherine Brewster from T3- John Connor's wife). Star Trek was able to overcome its plot holes with fun, interesting characters. Terminator's lack of good characters only makes the problems with the plot more apparent.<br/><br/>*Minor Spoiler* I must commend the CGI they used to paste 1980's Arnold's face onto a bodybuilder's body. I have read a few criticisms of it but heck, I thought it was the best part of the movie!"

","Greetings again from the darkness. Can't quite put my finger on it. Amazing action and terrific special effects, stunning sound and a decent story that compliments the previous installments ... but still something is missing.<br/><br/>First off, the casting is very odd throughout - Christian Bale as John Connor, Sam Worthington (in place of first choice Josh Brolin), bland Bryce Dallas Howard (replacing Claire Danes), Helena Bonham Carter (seriously??), Jane Alexander (in an action film??), and Common (with a competent scowl). Best choice is Anton Yelchin as Kyle Reese. Mr. Yelchin is having a nice summer with Terminator and Star Trek (where he is even better).<br/><br/>Next, director McG is an odd choice. Which of the Charlie's Angels films qualified him for this? Actually, most of his work is decent, but his work with the actors left much to be desired.<br/><br/>Thirdly, why the heck is Sam Worthington on screen more than Christian Bale? Just a wild guess, but I suppose there was quite a disparity in their paychecks!<br/><br/>Can't help but get a kick out the tie-ins to previous installment - Linda Hamilton's voice on tape, re-treads of famous lines and even CGI Arnold making an appearance. The machinery and effects continue to amaze, but this time the humans just don't hold up."

","The year is 2018; the setting is a bleak, post-apocalyptic world that has been ravaged by an ongoing war between humans and the deadly machine empire Skynet. John Connor is a scrappy and resourceful survivor who's prophesized as the chosen warrior to lead the resistance and defeat the machine empire, but in order to do so he's going to have to live long enough to find and protect Kyle Reese. The threat of annihilation grows with each passing day, but Connor finds help from an unlikely source. What could've been a worthy addition to the Terminator franchise is unfortunately weakened by unappealing characters, uninspired performances, lazy dialogue, and shaky direction that fails to add any real tension to its numerous action scenes. Shows signs of life with an exciting finale, but the film seems to be lacking a certain spark and would have benefited from stronger acting. Bale—strangely—is fairly cardboard as the heroic leader, but not even his best performance could make up for all of the film's shortcomings. **"
"freaky_dave","6","0","1","30 May 2009"," Slightly disappointed with this (Spoilers only if you haven't seen Terminator 3)
","I was a little unhappy with Salvation for a few reasons, but there were some good things about the movie. THe action scenes were top notch. THe special effects had a gritty look, probably to give us the look of a world destroyed and overrun with machines, and that was a good thing as well. T4 is definitely a wonderful action epic, and Sam Worthington gives a good performance, but I still felt underwhelmed by the movie for the simple fact that the story had little substance. The other actors besides Worthington were rather shallow as well. <br/><br/>Let's talk about the story first and why it was weak. I get that the world has ended, and the first three films gave us a lot of plot leading up to this. WHat I would've liked T4 to do was give us more of a story about Worthington's character and how he came to be what he is. I also would've liked to see a little back story that led to the point where JOhn COnnor (Bale) ends up being when we first see him is this bleak future. If you remember the ending in T3 the world was destroyed while COnnor and his girlfriend were saved in a bunker. T4 starts off with COnnor already pretty famous, as if he'd been doing this for years. What happened between T3 and the time before the events in T4? I would've liked to see more of this and maybe a little less special effects. The new Star Trek did this well. <br/><br/>Now onto the acting. As I said above, with the exception of WOrthington, the rest of the acting was shallow and disappointing. Bale does not escape criticism here. He does a lot of shouting, but little else. THere's an excellent fight sequence involving him and a Terminator at the end, but nothing else he does really stands out. After Dark Knight, and his turn in other films, I know he can do better. Anton Yelchin plays Kyle Reese. Some people like his acting here, but like Bale, he did a lot of shouting and not much else. I liked his character in Star Trek a lot more. THe real hero of this film is Sam Worthington as Marcus Wright. A character who has some of his own secrets, and brings a lot to the table with his performance here.<br/><br/>Good action scenes and good special effects are all to be found in T4. However if you're looking for a story of some kind and a little better acting from more than just one character, well you will be disappointed. Otherwise, knock yourself out."

","I have been highly anticipating the new film T4...but was somewhat disappointed..it was slow and repetitive..""I am John Connor and YOU are the resistance..."" and ""What's your name?...Kyle Reese..."" OK, I know who John Connor and Kyle Reese are..but get to the point..Obviously John Connor is in search of his father...w/o him, John cannot exist..but if you recall in the first film...Reese returned back in time with a polaroid of Conor's mother...in T4, the photo was barely intact.It is apparent that the old Reese has no idea that he is John's father...but in T4..it got too close for comfort..There were also editing errors like when Marcus and Blair get attacked from nowhere..made no sense..and then costume change errors...Anyway, I do agree that Marcus (Worthington) was the lead character and should be recognized as such over Bale, especially during Golden Globes and Academy Awards...Bales' character had no substance...By the way, if the Resistance had the signals to destroy the transports, then why didn't HQ just use it to destroy Skynet, rather than risking human lives, as well as preventing its sub HQ from getting destroyed.."
"SeanDTheFilmMaker","5","0","2","28 May 2009"," very hard to say, there's something wrong with it.
","OK I like movies with effects, action and etc. But sometimes the story needs to work. This story didn't work. TERMINATOR 1 machines go back in time to kill John Conner's mother, then in Terminator 2 they come to kill john conner, then in Terminator 3 they kind of had given up and went after John's fellow soldiers until they accidentally ran across John conner. All of which makes sense, right? But it has been assumed that since this horrible thing will happen in the future which is what sold us on that the whole time travel thing was possible. Kind of like how we went to Jupiter in 2001 ....right right right! But in this film they hadn't even approached the time travel deal yet the war is seemingly really close to ending. Seemed like a stretch here as they cant find gas but yet they can travel through time.<br/><br/>Second plot hole, and a fairly obvious one. The Terminators needed to look like skeletons in order to pass for humans. In this movie they, oh I don't know , kept forgetting to put the skin on or something. Which to me tells me that they weren't even trying to pass them off for human, so there is no point. Even then it seemed like an odd decision to make as far as infiltrating goes as all they need are metal detectors. I cant even get through airport metal detector with 25 cents in my pocket.<br/><br/>Now all of these fairly obvious points aside, which includes the time travel issue of changing a future not made yet severely alters the circumstance. Kind of like someone telling you that you will die at age 80 so you live more dangerously and get killed prematurely cause you let your guard down.<br/><br/>Again, that aside, it needed to be fun. In all of the other movies they had some element of fun and even humor. I mean come on the ""Talk to the hand"" in terminator three was hilarious! This had nothing, just grim to grimmer. Even Shindlers list had moments of levity. Considering that this was about war, thats usually where comedy suddenly appears. IE: Fullmetal jacket, Saving private Ryan, and etc all have moments of levity.<br/><br/>Then next part on this list of issues would probably be the transformer influence on the bigger machines. Yep, while they didn't disguise themselves as, how did young John put it ""A pack of cigarettes"", they did have the transformer sound. Hard to type or even describe but was for a moment some other people and even myself was saying ""wait a minute!"" which meant I wasn't the only one who noticed.<br/><br/>Though I will give it this one, Bale and the other fella did a good job. The cinematographer gave it a good feel, editing was excellent, and music was not to shabby except for the opening. I think what it was was the fact that the new Star trek surprised my expectations completely and is a hard act to follow. So depends on your mood too. One movie shows an optimistic view of the future and the other one is a more pessimistic view. And right now we can use a little more optimism."

","Movies that include a lot of CGI look stupid.<br/><br/>There, I said it.<br/><br/>It's one thing to use CGI to enhance a shot, or to add in something more or less impossible to replicate with normal special effects, but when I see a CGI ship colliding into a CGI bridge, resulting in a CGI explosion, all set in front of a CGI background, I just think: ""It's amazing how much effort they went through to bore me."" It's like Transformers, the latest Indiana Jones, Wolverine, all the new Star Wars, the last two Matrix movies, and so many others: it's just not convincing! There's no point in the movie where I'm lost in the drama and moment, because I'm well aware at all times that these are simply high tech cartoons. (although I did like Transformers and Crystal Skull, just not for the special effects) Without any really likable characters, a serious plot, and the undeniable fact that John Conner has to survive, I'd call this movie all but worthless.<br/><br/>What makes it worse is the fact that Star Trek, that came out right before it, was magnificent, and the CGI was mostly used in the space scenes (where it was relatively effective), and the rest of the movie was based upon a strong plot and great character development.<br/><br/>In contrast, Terminator: Salvation is high priced garbage."
"Scatterpulse","6","0","1","28 May 2009"," Meh
","I have to say, I found this film a little puzzling. The first thing that struck me as a little bizarre is the immense stupidity of the machines; they can apparently be ambushed with little more than a boom box lying in the middle of the road, and it took Skynet a freaking eternity to finally try to kill Kyle. I mean seriously--if killing Kyle was all it would take to end the human resistance, why in the bloody pus-spewing hell didn't the plethora of machines that came into contact with him just grind him into a bloody paste? It boggled my mind a bit. I was expecting to see a truly chilling tale of cold, calculating machines, not just a bunch of skeletal drones throwing themselves around uselessly. Also, Skynet struck me as behaving very emotionally for a supposedly ""cold"" and ""calculating"" entity.<br/><br/>Another thing that left me scratching my head was the character of Star. Throughout the film it's hinted at that she has a sort of sixth sense concerning the machines, but it's never explained and winds up looking like a lazy deus ex machina move.<br/><br/>And the cheese...oh my. As soon as Kate states that John's heart is too weak to withstand his injuries, it becomes painfully obvious that Marcus is going to donate his own. The movie up until that scene won't stop bashing the viewer over the head with the fact that his heart is human. Also, pretty much from the first moment Marcus was introduced, I thought ""oh, he's a machine"". I mean...he fixes all kinds of machines, he's practically bullet-proof, and he somehow takes on a Terminator scout by hurling a tire iron at it, while speeding down a highway, while the scout is zipping all over the place. He's a machine. It's never a mystery. The movie plays out the revelation of this fact as though it's some huge plot twist, but I was just left scratching my head.<br/><br/>And, frankly, the whole ""machine with a soul"" theme has been done so very many times before (and much better). In fact, it was done in the second Terminator movie. Do we really need to see this again? Really? Well, all my griping and bashing aside, this is actually a pretty enjoyable movie overall. Yes it's predictable, occasionally cheesy, and the machines are idiots, but the action sequences actually leave you believing that the characters are in real danger. The CGI is also really good; there wasn't a single moment in the movie where I was distracted by being struck by a really bad or just awkward CGI effect. The acting is great, the cinematography is great, etc. etc. Also, the big reveal about how John's entry into Skynet's sanctum was orchestrated through the beginning makes a lot of the incompetence of the machines early on in the film a little easier to swallow.<br/><br/>And seriously--who didn't love seeing Arnold again?"
"mp234003","3","0","3","27 May 2009"," Not happy
","Before I begin my comments on Terminator Salvation, I want to rant a little about the fundamental Terminator series flaw that this movie resurrected in my mind. I never understood how John Connor can send his father back in time to create him. In order for Connor to do this he would have to exist prior to sending his father back. But hey, it's just a movie right? Anyway, I thought this movie sucked. The special effects were pretty good but as they say, you can't polish a turd. The story was awful and I didn't care at all about any of the characters. Christian Bale's voice was comical at times and all Marcus Knight did was scream. James Cameron must be sad to see what has happened to this franchise. The first two films were tight and straight to the point. Dark and exciting. The last two have seemed muddled and boring, particularly this one. I also couldn't help but laugh at CG Arnold. I laughed out load way too often during this movie."
"Apemangalore","5","0","1","25 May 2009"," An occasionally fun, but ultimately unnecessary, sequel
","Admitedly, it wasn't until just weeks ago when I decided to watch the first two entries in the Terminator series. I thoroughly enjoyed the first film, with its terrific action, compelling story, and solid performances. Judgment Day instantly became one of my top 20 favorite movies of all time, expanding upon everything that made part one such an engaging film. Now, going into Terminator Salvation, I wasn't interested in whether or not it would top the first two films; what I received was a fun but ultimately unnecessary entry.<br/><br/>Much like this month's Wolverine (and, frankly, the majority of all other summer blockbusters), I found Terminator Salvation to be little more than an action film. However, unlike Fox's X-Men prequel, nearly every bit of the action in Salvation is spectacular. Rather than relying on the frenetic shaky-cam ""technique"" that has plagued so many recent action films, the camera observes what's going on.<br/><br/>The acting is, overall, decent. Sam Worthington is especially great as Marcus Wright, and Anton Yelchin (or ""Chekov from Star Trek"") does a solid job, surprisingly, portraying the young Kyle Reese. Now, despite being a terrific actor, I never bought Christian Bale as man's only hope. He's not a very compelling voice on the radio, to be honest, and what heroic deed he accomplishes to inspire so many people is never really shown. In fact, it almost felt as though John Connor was, dare I say, shoehorned into this movie, as the plot mostly seems to center around Marcus and his struggle. As a result, there is next to no character development from anybody (again, aside from Marcus), and the movie simply goes from set-piece to set-piece.<br/><br/>Despite being an unnecessary entry in the series, Terminator Salvation is entertaining. The action sequences are terrific and most of the performances are solid. However, there isn't much for these actors to work with, as the characters they're portraying are severely underdeveloped. Whereas the first two Terminators strived to be so much more, Salvation proves to be nothing more, and nothing less, than a straight-forward action flick."
"juras_avis","6","0","2","25 May 2009"," Some thoughts - Good action, lacks everything else
","Quick thoughts: T4 is stripped of interesting characters, nuanced dialog, fresh quotes, subtext that we loved in T1/ T2, and given a hefty dose of excellent action and fanboy service. Characters are rather flat (lacking basic depth and progressive development throughout the story arch), performances--especially Bale's--were monotone, and the dialog is reduced to simplistic declamations. However the excellent action scenes certainly saved this otherwise mediocre film. It is a loud, fun movie that is dumber than T3, so be sure to just turn off your brain when watching T4 to enjoy it for what it is.<br/><br/>Specific problems: T4 could have also used more gore: e.g., while humans were at the death camp, you never really see how they were disposed of. Since I didn't care for the characters due to lackluster performances and one-dimensionality, I had no real empathy for them. Had they shown specifically how people were killed, those segments would have been far more intense, and I certainly would have felt some concern for the characters.<br/><br/>The cuts to give the film a PG-13 rating also hurt the logic of one particular scene. *POSSIBLE SPOILER ALERT* Pay attention when the female pilot Blair starts to remove her top to treat her wounds. One moment she is with Marcus, and he then walks off. The very next moment she is surrounded by three other men who said ""We were watching you!"" before they try to rape her. OK, so they were watching Blair converse with her big, muscular friend Marcus who just walked away a moment ago? *END SPOILER ALERT* I believe director McG said that he removed some footage of Blair topless and treating her wounds, and you can certainly tell. The transition from Blair and Marcus to Blair vs. her would-be rapists is too jarring; it needed some filler so we could at least get a sense that time had passed from when Marcus left to when the attackers arrived. <br/><br/>Also one other thing--T4 doesn't really respect its audience at all as it spells out its themes for you at the end. Worse yet, the film spoon feeds you a summary of the plot during its climax which had me fidgeting around in my seat, just waiting for the exposition to end.<br/><br/>Probably the greatest disappointment I had in T4 was that T1 and T2's nightmarish vision of the future were both far more disturbing and memorable than that found in T4.<br/><br/>All in all, T4 was saved by its excellent action and CG effects. I recommend seeing it at a matinée."

","I've been disappointed going into summer blockbusters. Just last year the fourth Indiana Jones film was released and left me a little downtrodden, but not completely miserable. Lest we forget the catastrophe that was Spider-Man 3. I shudder at the mention of this film. What a flop! That said, I would have to place this film up there with summer let downs. Not a huge let down like spidey did, but it was more so than Indy.<br/><br/>The film starts with the execution of death row inmate Marcus Wright (Sam Worthington), whose character will come back later on. Jump several years later to 2018. A time when Skynet has completely taken over the world, unleashing a plethora of human killing machines. The survivors are a part of the Resistance. Christian Bale play John Connor, the so- called prophet of the Resistance whose whole existence has been linked to this great war.<br/><br/>Marcus comes back and meets up with Kyle Reese (Anton Yelchin), who will eventually go back in time to become the father of John Connor (this is explained early on, as well as in the original Terminator movie). He is taken prisoner as Marcus meets up with Blair Williams (Moon Bloodgood), a Resistance fighter pilot who had to ditch during an air battle. The two try to make it back to Connor.<br/><br/>The majority of the film is filled with endless and often needless action, showing off an arsenal of special effects from stunt driving to explosions and of course, CGI. As cool and shiny as some of the effects are, it takes away from the flow of the story. Fight scenes interrupt the plot too often and we are left there sitting, watching bullets fly and barrels blow up.<br/><br/>Director McG, whose work includes both Charlie's Angels movies, We Are Marshall, and assorted music videos. The likely choice to direct such a bold and incredibly large scale project would be this man. To his credit, he didn't do a terrible job. It wasn't a great job, but he was not the reason behind this movie failing to meet the hype. He put several hero shots of Bale that are so obvious and unnecessary.<br/><br/>The blame rests partly on the acting. Worthington plays a solid character who should have been developed more. He also goes in and out of his Australian accent a bit too much. Bale puts on a lackluster performance, being too cold and heartless, instead of heroic like he has been told he would be. There is also a big credit given to Common in the opening credits. He plays a minor character and to add onto that, he doesn't play it well. It's just a face and a name with little acting going on. He was much better in Ridley Scott's American Gangster.<br/><br/>The writing took a nose dive from the beginning. Quick one-liners and on the nose dialogue take away from the film far too often. Too many lines from the previous Terminator films are used in painfully obvious ways (the audience, myself included, couldn't hold it together for ""I''ll be back."") It was dull, tacky, and lacked the passion of the first too films.<br/><br/>One scene in particular made me feel like I was watching a stunt spectacular. There were explosions, bullets flying through the air, and a motorcycle jump that was completely unnecessary.<br/><br/>There is a lot wrong with this film obviously. The technology used by the machines seems far more advanced than in the other films, but I don't think it's that far into the future because Kyle Reese is only a teenager. How is it that the terminators can withstand molten metal, a point that clearly made in Terminator 2? There are so many things that don't add up from a technology and history standpoint. If this film were placed on a timeline with the others, parts wouldn't add up. It was very rushed.<br/><br/>There are some good things, I guess. Danny Elfman did a fine job with the score. He is pretty reliable for big budget films, especially with Tim Burton. This type is film isn't usually what he works with. I guess great composers can meet just about any task. Other bright spots are Yelchin's performance (not great, but solid), and some of the camera work/CGI shots are impressive. Nothing like Transformers, but definitely enjoyable.<br/><br/>I guess after the recorded rant that was leaked involving Christian Bale and a crew member was a bad omen for this film. It will still gross a lot of money but I don't think it will reach epic proportions. At least I hope not. I'm pulling for Disney's Up to take the number one spot next week."

The first 1 hour and 30 minutes of the movie was horrible! So bad that I really wanted to walk out of the theater. It was clear that McG had no idea what he was doing, the script was bad, the acting was really really bad. It was so cheesy that it made the film so unbelievable you didn't care. The only saving grace of the film was Christian Bale. Without him, this film would be a total disaster. Terminator Salvation did not stay true to its franchise name and does not even compare to Cameron's T2. The editing made the story seem so long and choppy. The terminators did not seem scary, there was no fear driving the film. The CGI was the best part, but without substance in the film, there was no point in watching it.

The starlet/cyborg love story, the 'Star' character and Bale seeming lost during most of his scenes drag this film down near the cheese level of an 'Independence Day'.

Between multiple helicopter crashes and being fragged through the mid-section by a Terminator, the s.o.b. just couldn't be stopped. This really prevented me from investing in his character's storyline. I never felt he was in danger.<br/><br/>We seasoned moviegoers do realize that Hollywood will cast the widest net to bring in the most viewers. This will always lead to the hero being overplayed to appeal to the main target audience. Just once though, it would be nice to have a more vulnerable hero when the character is supposed to be a ""mortal human type"".<br/><br/>Still I enjoyed most of the character portrayals in this show. And am totally in agreement with comments regarding Sam Worthington's performance -- very memorable-- and dynamic to boot.<br/><br/>My summary: Negatives- No sense of dread or impending doom as so well captured in T1 & T2; Hero lead portrayed with near superhero tendencies; An over-abundance of explosions; The ""one man does it all"" syndrome as portrayed by Conner's in the last third of the show; and far too many homages to other flicks. Positives- Excellent production values; Cgi was handled with care; Never tired of seeing Terminators in all forms; a performance from Worthington that should put the movie industry on notice; and lastly, some very memorable images throughout the show. I would even say that I could view this movie multiple times, so I enjoyed it more than not. That's my two cents folks."
