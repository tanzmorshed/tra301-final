"bob the moo","Null","41","51","21 May 2002"," Clichéd, but better than I expected it to be
","When Sara's mother is killed in a car accident she comes to live in a predominately black area in Chicago.  She is befriended by black Chenille and starts to fall for her brother Derek.  Derek teaches her the latest hip-hop dances to help her fit in and together they begin to fall for each other.  However a white girl seeing a clever black man is never going to be popular and the couple must overcome many obstacles to see their dreams and be true to themselves.<br/><br/>Did someone say `a black Dirty Dancing?'  Essentially that's what this is, although the story is naturally a bit more urban than that film.  The story is about overcoming to reach your dreams, and it does it quite well  better than I expected.  The love story is nice without being too romanticised. The obstacles are the usual things in an `urban' film  the challenge of mixed race relationships, the temptation to back up your crew instead of getting out etc.  These are quite cliched but are still well done.<br/><br/>My main problem came with the strength of black culture in the filmnot every black person (even in a poor area) talks like a gangstaand not everyone says `aiiiirite'  and why did Sara only become accepted when she started to imitate black culture and speak in that way.  It may be realistic, but I felt that Sara should have been allowed to be herself rather than be seen to be assimilated into the hip-hop culture (I don't mean that she shouldn't have got involved with the scene  but did she have to lose part of herself to get there?).  However these are minor side issues that many people won't even think about.<br/><br/>The cast are good for MTV teens.  Julia Stiles is cool and Thomas is cute and charming.  The rest of the cast fall into so many black stereotypes  we have gangsta friend, baby mothers galore, useless baby father, jealous bitchy ex-girlfriends etc.  However they are just what you expect so I wasn't too upset.  Fredro Starr was cool as Malakai  even if the character was just one big hood cliché.<br/><br/>The soundtrack is hot and the dance scenes are sexy  I wish I could do it! They are much more enjoyable than Dirty Dancing's scenes  although some day this will feel dated too!  Overall I expected another piece of MTV teen tat, but I was pleasantly surprised by a story that, despite being ridden with clichés, is actually very involving and enjoyable."
"AKS-6","5","21","29","28 April 2001"," Too clichéd to be really interesting
","[This comment contains SPOILERS!]<br/><br/>The main problem with Save the Last Dance is that it is too clichéd. We've been there, done that several times before. Also, some scenes were very embarrassing because they were so silly. E.g. when Sara is auditioning and Derek runs up on stage. Oh please... The same point could have been made in a more subtle way. Having said that, though, I must say that the film was also very entertaining, the music was great and the acting was more than just okay, especially Julia Stiles was impressive. (5/10)"
"stefaffi","10","40","61","20 February 2001"," A very touching story, with some good points
","I really wanted to see this movie, I like Julia Stiles in her other movies (Down to You, 10 Things I Hate About You) and think that she is a very talented actress.  I was not disappointed.<br/><br/>As for this movie... I am very impressed.  I feel that Julia portrayed very real emotion and reactions to losing her mother, and placing the blame for losing her mother firmly on herself is the reaction that most people would have in that circumstance.  The train scene in the beginning sets a very good foundation for the rest of the movie, and it goes from there.  To those who would say that her acting is overdone, I say put yourself in those shoes: you've lost your Mom, best friend, confidante, and the foundation your entire world rests on, and think how it would affect you.<br/><br/>There are some parts of the movie that are slightly cliched.. dancing as she walks under the L - we saw Jennifer Grey dance her way up a flight of stairs in ""Dirty Dancing"" - but then again, not much in life hasn't been done before, so I don't count that against it.  Even Nikki is a believable character - I know there were quite a few like her when I was in high school! While it seems improbable that Sara would instantly fit in with her new crowd, it is made believable by Stile's portrayal of Sara as a slightly self-conscious, but not shy person, who will take a person at face value while still believing in the inherent good of people in general.  The match with Derek is natural, since they share these traits.<br/><br/>There are a few unbelievable parts - the empty studio (complete with barre) that she practices in with Derek, Steps, Sarah offering to walk the 5 blocks home alone, Sara dancing ballet (not that she didn't dance well, just that Stiles body is not standard for classical ballet) but all in all, I feel that this is a very touching movie, and would recommend it to everyone female, even my Grandmother (the language may be shocking, but she was in the Army, I know she's heard worse :)"

","Okay, so it won't bring home a little golden guy. . .it's from MTV Films for crying out loud.  But who says everything has to?  I will say this; this movie actually had a little more substance than what I walked in expecting. I went to the theater on opening night with 5 girlfriends expecting to hear some good music and see some good choreography and scenery of Chicago--a city I dearly love.  I got all of that.  But I also got a glimpse of broken homes, the dynamic between a father and daughter who don't know each other, friends who've gone by the wayside that you still don't want to let go of, I could say more.  Oh, and the thing that really still pisses people off though it's 2001. . .interracial relationships.  I'm not saying the plot isn't a little rehashed, but there's not a whole lot that's new out there. No, it's not a great film--I give it a B, but I'd see it again.  In fact I did see it again with another set of friends on Saturday night.  All in all, I saw this movie with 10 friends of varying sex, age and race and all of us liked it.  I think that's a pretty good showing."
"robyn_mallia","Null","37","61","20 February 2001"," Breaking down the barriers of racism.
","This movie does what few movies over the past year or so have been able to do. It takes you to a place which actually exists and it takes real issues head on. Julia Stiles and Sean Patrick Thomas give real performances they do not come off as ""cardboard"" characters but as real human beings. The plot was simple enough to be good, it didn't require you having a past knowledge of the world of dance but yet didn't rule you out if you weren't black with a bunch of ""black talk"". This movie talks to teens. We are able to understand the pressures that surround us, the music we listen to, and just our world. Sure, you have your typical characters but what movie doesn't. Go see the film and then make up your mind. It is one of my favourite new films for the past few years."
"qwho","Null","49","88","8 July 2004"," only my new favorite movie!
","I just finished watching this terrific movie, I had always meant to see it but somehow never got around to it. This time when I came across it in the video store and saw that Julia Stiles was in it, I had to get it. I did not know who she was when the movie was released, but have since enjoyed her in Mona Lisa Smile and the Prince and Me and couldn't wait to see her in this film. <br/><br/>This was the best work I have seen her do to this point. It was so much better than I expected, based on the meager 6.1 stars it received overall on IMDb...Julia was wonderful in it, as was Sean Patrick Thomas. Their chemistry was terrific and the story was riveting and the dancing awesome (both the ballet and the dancing throughout the movie.) I don't know how much of the dancing Julia actually did, but all of it was beautifully done.<br/><br/>The film was sweet, touching and violent, and worked in all aspects. The rest of the casting was very good too, all the performances were terrific.<br/><br/>I will buy it on DVD asap...it was that good! I think it will be enjoyed by men and women, I can't wait to have my teenage son see it. Truly a must see!"
"Skippy-60","7","12","18","13 January 2001"," Slammin'? Kinda....
","Let's get one thing straight.  Teen movies are starting to get unbearable. So it is a relief when something like ""Save the Last Dance"" comes along and offers something up that's just a little off of redundancy.  There seems to be a lot going on here, with the main characters dealing with everything from death of loved ones to single parenthood to racial issues.  You don't see THAT often in teen movies!  But what it really comes down to is DANCE! Julia Stiles plays a former ballet dancer whose dreams are self-imposingly dashed by a tragic event, and the rest of the movie is about her re-chasing her dream in totally different circumstances than what she's used to (mainly: being the only white girl in a rough Chicago all-black neighbourhood).  The movie does touch upon a lot of issues, as previously mentioned, but none of them are explored enough to give  the film a lot of substance.  What does make the film somewhat enjoyable is the dance sequences and the performances.  There seems to be a real chemistry between Stiles (who's great in everything she does!) and Sean Patrick Thomas, who is really talented!  I've only seen him in supporting roles, but this film shows he can be a leading man.  The scene stealer award goes to Kerry Washington, who is so much fun in every one of her scenes.  I hope to see a lot more of her in the future.  IN A NUTSHELL:  It's good to see a teen film that deals with more issues than just prom dates, and it will make you think, but it's not deep enough to be more than just a ""dance"" movie in the same vain as ""Centre Stage"" and ""Dirty Dancing"", culminating in long dance routine by Stiles, and when the routine is over, everything is resolved. Are all the issues REALLY resolved?  Only in Hollywood!! Skippy's Rating: 7/10"
"segacs","3","14","23","12 August 2006"," Trite and poorly written
","This movie is a sort of updated Romeo and Juliet- meets- Dirty Dancing, and attempts to take on the complex issues surrounding racism and stereotypes while showcasing some fun dancing. Unfortunately, it fails on every level, thanks to a poor script that allows this movie to lapse into the many stereotypes it was hoping to dispel.<br/><br/>The two leads - Julia Stiles and Sean Patrick Thomas - do what they can, but nobody could sell this drivel. The writing is cringe-worthy in many, many spots. At times, even the actors seem to be unable to believe that they're actually require to say some of the things that they say. Everyone in the film besides the leads speaks in the sort of ""gansta"" talk that seems like a Hollywood/MTV notion of how kids really speak. Then there are the clichés: the teenage mothers, the drive-by shootings, the drug dealers and pretty much everything else you could think of.<br/><br/>Even the dancing - the film's supposed highlight - is poorly shot, so you don't get to see the sequences properly. Stiles insisted on doing all her own ballet, rather than using a body double - an admirable sentiment, perhaps, but someone should've noticed that it made the whole subplot of her being good enough to audition for Julliard rather unbelievable when she's shown stumbling over even simple steps. The dance scenes at the club were so chopped up that the audience is denied even the simple pleasure of some great dance scenes to break up this saccharine, eye-rolling plot.<br/><br/>Save The Last Dance could never have been a truly excellent movie, but it could have at least been fun and entertaining. But the writing was so terrible, it doesn't even achieve this goal."
"fred112371","2","14","23","22 October 2004"," really corny
","Lame script, bad directing. The school scenes were so unrealistic -- c'mon, on her very first day at school a black girl completely befriends her out of nowhere and treats her like she's her best friend, even sticking up for her to every other girl in school. Couldn't they at least have set it up better, where Sarah does something to gain her trust, or her friend has a white parent, or anything interesting? Something besides no reason or charity work.<br/><br/>The scenes where they practiced dancing in the empty school room, they were so stupid it was embarrassing to watch. And practicing how to sit? She's white, not a guy. The club dancing scenes, also ridiculous and hard to watch. Show me someone in the room making a comment or something. Wasn't the point of this movie to make a statement about racial tension and acceptance? She hardly had any real problems that weren't easily avoided. Even the eventual ""fight"" with her boyfriend lasted only 2 minutes and was reconciled for no particular reason.<br/><br/>And too often I always notice Stiles acting, if you know what I mean, which isn't a good thing. Like in a high school play.<br/><br/>The scene in the ER waiting room with her friend going off on her, that was about the only good dramatic scene. And even that was a cliché quote (""black girls don't have enough good black men anymore"") that I've heard many times before on TV and movies.<br/><br/>Sarah's constant ""I don't want to talk about it"" about her boycotting dancing and about her mother...cliché like a bad sitcom. Ooh, but then she overcomes it all in the end, with the help of her boyfriend...how surprising.<br/><br/>This was really painful to watch. I gave it a 2 because I've seen a lot worse movies. The script and filming must have been put together really quickly because it seemed like there wasn't much imagination behind it. I actually thought going into it that there would be some interesting viewpoints or more hard-hitting scenes. I guess I forgot it was an MTV movie."
"andyscott77","Null","18","31","30 January 2002"," Run away guys!
","Aside from being about 40 minutes TOO LONG, this movie was filled with the usual tripe that some people label ""issues"".  These ""issues"" have been done ad nauseum, and really didn't need to be dealt with again.  The actors put in a couple of decent scenes, but the movie on a whole is boring, and was filled with ""I'm soooo depressed... let's dance!"" to paraphrase.  Save your time, save your money and rent something else.  This film fails on so many levels.  Julia Styles is way too melodramatic and the gang scenes are very forced and sterotyped.  Even the ""romantic hero"", Sean Patrick Thomas puts on the bad boy hat for about two scenes, and then runs to Julliard to cheer on his girlfriend.  A ballet dancing gang member.  Right.  It just doesn't work.  The girlfriend might enjoy this one for a rental for the so called romantic story, but it holds no entertainment value as far as the plot or acting is concerned.<br/><br/>Rent Finding Forrester.  You'll get alot more out of it."

This movie is stupid. It plays on all the lame stereotypes this society has put on us, and plays on the whole ""forbidden"" race issue. This movie makes me sick in my stomach.<br/><br/>Don't get your life lessons from Hollywood. If you think this movie makes any sort of positive point you need to get a life."

","Promos for Save the last Dance have been running for quite a while now and everytime i would see one i would go. ""i have to see this movie"", but naother part of me was going ""but what if this is just another teen film"". I went with my initial instinct and saw the movie and i'm glad i did. This film is so much more than just a teen film. in fact i saw a lot of adults in the audience when i saw it. Save the Last Dance really makes you think about some of the issues that are addressed in the film.<br/><br/>The plot revolves around Sara Johnson(Julia Stiles) who moves to a very bad part of Chicago with her dad after her mom is killed in a car accident. her mom is killed during this accident while trying to rush to see sara try out for Julliard. Sara is so heart borken by this event that she holds off on dance. When she arrives to chicago she attends a mostly black highschool and has to learn to fit in. She meets Chenille(Kerry Washington) who shows her the ropes and how to get around in school. She also meets her brother Derek(Sean Patrick Thomas)who had a shaddy past but now has dreams of going to georgetown and becoming a doctor. Soon they all begin to hang out and go to this hip hop club called steps. Soon derek is showing sara how to dance like them and she picks up on it pretty quickly. soon they meet afterschool and practice and he learns that she once did ballet and that passion for dance soon turns into a romance for the both of them. problems arise when this interacial pairing is put to the test on many occasions.<br/><br/>The acting by everyone is pretty good but it's the chemistry of the 2 leads that carry the film. Julia Stiles is a very talented actress who is really breaking out in the industry and i hope more adult work comes her way that will trully test her talent. Sean Patrick Thomas is also good as Derek. he has a very low key charisma and fascinating screen prescence. when these 2 are together however the film becomes so much better because their chemistry is so strong that you honestly want them to be together. The Acting by the supporting cast, especially fredro starr and Kerry Washington is also good.<br/><br/>The music and Dancing are a real highlight. the hip hop scenes are very fun and energetic and one of the best aspects of the film. also the scenes where derek is tryng to teach sara how to dance is when the film is at its best..<br/><br/>I really recommend this film because it was very enjoyable and shouldn't be written off as just naother teen flick. check it out. B+"
"alissaroode","Null","5","7","18 February 2001"," People Liked this movie???!
","**maybe spoilers**<br/><br/>I can't believe the number of positive reviews i have seen for this tragic excuse for a movie. OK, maybe it's not that bad, but at the very best, it is mediocre.<br/><br/>It boasts some grand overacting from the normally very likeable Julia Stiles, an oversimplistic plot, and to top it all off, eveyr actor in the film seems bored with their stereotypical character. There is no chemistry between any of the characters, even the hatred between Stiles' character Sara and her 'nemesis' Nikki, seems forced and tired. The dancing in uninspired (except for the big finale scene at the end).<br/><br/>The pace is slow, and most of the story telling techniques used are stale and obvious. The characters are flat and worthless, for example Derek's friend Malaki, whom Derek says 'has a good heart'. This 'good heart' is nowhere in evidence in this movie, because he is played as a standard ""bad guy"" with absolutely no redeeming qualities. It is impossible for the viewer to understand why the bright, intelligent, and kind Derek would remain loyal to his jerk of a friend. What does any of this have to do with the plot of a dancer struggling to get along in a new world? Nothing. That's another of the problems with Save The Last Dance: there are too many sub plots that are not dealt with in an interesting and entertaining way. Instead of weaving the sub plots together to create a coherent story, the sub plots are cut and pasted crudely so that it looks like this: Sara moves to the ghetto, must try to fit in; Sara doesn't like her dad; Sara makes friends with Chenille; Sara falls for Derek; Sara learns how to be hip hop; Derek must choose between Sara and the evil Malaki; Sara gives up on everything; Sara tries again; Sara makes friends with her dad; Sara triumphs over all her difficulties with one astounding blow. The end. There is very little correlation between different aspects of the plot, leaving me the audience feeling bored and hollow.<br/><br/>This is not a good movie. It does not realistically show life. It is not inspiring (becuase it is uninspired). It is vaguely entertaining, but don't have high expectations. I went in thinking it would be energetic and funky, and left yawning and wanting to go to bed and forget that i saw it. Wait for the video... don't waste the cash on the big screen... it's not worth it."

For me, it was interesting mostly because of the dancing (fusion of hip-hop and ballet). There's some interesting performances, even if the editing is there to show the dancefloor moves to a perfection that might not have actually been achieved by Julia Stiles.

","It's very rare that a film comes along that's truly worthless but 'Save the Last Dance' is most certainly it. Thomas Carter has created a film full of embarrassing black stereotypes. We have the males; 'gangstas' and guys trying to forget their criminal pasts (if you are a black male in this movie, than you MUST have some form of criminal past) and the women, who are crack-ho's or single mothers. Enter Julia Stiles prissy little white ballerina who has daddy-issues but being white, is the only decent person with a squeaky clean past. The only way black people will accept her, is if she alters her ballerina classical training by embracing r'n'b or gyrating on the dance floor to hip-hop. She must also learn to talk like she is auditioning for a female version of 'Malibu's Most Wanted', although sadly this is no comedy. This might on a good day be considered a forgivable piece of film-making but add to this dialogue written by a retarded child (a look at the 'bitch' argument in the school gym drives this point home) and you have a film that's both poorly made and offencive. The soothing thing is this predictable bland nonsense is most audiences will get what exactly what they need to reinforce black and white stereotypes....the disturbing thing is it's popularity and acceptance as a 'feel good harmless film'. In an ideal world this would be banned...or better still not made at all. Fortunatly later attempts at this, like the recent 'Take the Lead' handle this subject with a little more competency."

","Throughout history there has been hardships for African Americans. Slavery, human rights, discrimination, and racism have been very obvious problems for them. Although they have gained their human rights and slavery has been abolished, discrimination and racism are still around in the twenty-first century. Within the romantic drama Save The Last Dance directed by Thomas Carter, 2001, it lets its viewers see and recognize what people are still like to this day when dealing with different races such as white and black. <br/><br/>Within this movie the main character Sara wants to be a ballerina. Her mother died in a car accident on her way to see her perform, in attempt to get into Sara Lawrence University. She had to move in with her father who is a struggling musician and live in a rundown apartment, in Chicago. Sara's new school is mainly of African American descent and she is the minority. She makes friends with a girl named Chenille and starts adopt some things that Chenille does in order to fit in. <br/><br/>Chenille has a brother Derek. Derek and Sara fall in love and it is hard for them because they get a lot of problems just because they are in interracial couple. Sara and Derek both get into fights defending themselves from their peers and friends. The explanation for Chenille to Sara about why she shouldn't be with Derek was because she was white. She said that since Sara was white, she was taking one of the only good men left for the black woman. This is complete discrimination against Sara, even thought Chenille is her best friend there in Chicago.<br/><br/>. Sara who grew up in the southwest, was not used to this ghetto Chicago area. She was taught how to dance like everyone else, and started to listen to the same music as they did, so she would fit in and have a good time. Her best friend from home doesn't think it's even possibly for Sara to find a guy down where she is because no one is white. She asks questions such as, ""Have you seen anyone get shot yet?"" Such questions and statements show that the low class status of this neighborhood is discriminated against. <br/><br/>Save The Last Dance portrays the discrimination that still going on during this day and age. Gun fights, death, clubs, music, romance, tragedy, dancing, and racism are all present within this movie. The lower class Chicago area shows how dangerous things can be. The events that happen between the Sara and Derek and other events within this movie truly show how America is still discriminatory towards people."

","Yet another bad movie pushing a Hollywood favourite agenda and claiming to be doing something ""new and unique"". This time it's yet another dishing served up by the interracial crowd and targeted to poor defenseless teenagers. Julia Stile's character, after the untimely death of her mother is in a state of mourning and confusion of her life. Soon thereafter she is ""dogged"" by a black man looking to take advantage of her situation. The movie makers try to suggest he is heroic. His behaviour is nothing short of predatorial. Soon Julia Stiles is engaged in unprotected sex with one of America's greatest risk categories for HIV and other STDs. But this is to be ignored. Apparently if someone, anyone, shows interest in the docile Stiles, they are to be applauded. Or, more appropriately, if anyone is to push a distraught teenager into a interracial relationship they are heroic.<br/><br/>The movie follows the pattern of previous interracial propaganda movies such as ""Guess Who's Coming to Dinner"" and ""Sayonaro"". Anyone that doesn't understand or fully support the relationship is ""evil"" and anyone who does is ""a good person."" Tired second rate movie making to be sure. Please turn off your brain when going to this one and act like a cheerleader with an IQ of zero is what the directors require. A father who loves his daughter should never serve her up to a predator and encourage immoral behaviour. Yet, watch and see.<br/><br/>Good movie making requires balance and full development of characters. This one doesn't try in the least.

","I can understand folks getting into this movie's story and characters (though even on those counts, I don't give this terribly high marks). Unfortunately, for anyone really interested in the serious dance aspects, it will be a disappointment. Ms. Stiles does not look like a talented, advanced dance student. There is clumsy, obvious use of a dance double, mixed in with shots of Ms. Stiles that should never have made it into the final cut (or they should have been kept to face only, not revealing her obviously non-dancer form); worse still is when they actually have her trying to carry a lot of the dance sequence, as during her audition for Juilliard. Actually, that whole sequence, including the lines and behavior of the teachers running the audition, is pretty ridiculous and unauthentic. And the dance that she performs for the audition is dreadful, although we're obviously supposed to view it as a triumph of rebellious artistry. In real life, that dancer would have pretty much no chance of being admitted to Juilliard's dance program. Hard to believe the movie-makers couldn't even manage to spell ""Juilliard"" correctly on the placard set up to indicate the location of the auditions.<br/><br/>Watch this movie for the story and some mildly interesting young actors; as far as the dance sequences go, be prepared to strenuously exercise your ""suspension of disbelief"" muscles."

","Possibly the worst movie Julia Stiles has ever made.  She's not bad in the movie, although she could have been better, and even more to the point, they probably could have casted someone better than her in it.<br/><br/>The script should have been looked over a few more times before they actually went into production, and the plot was so distressing and horrible, that I wanted to cry because of what a bad movie this was. Sean Patrick Thomas, was really good and I thought that he did do a very convincing job in the film (but on the other hand, how hard was his character?).  Stiles really needs to find better work than this.  I really didn't like the transformation her character made from the beginning of the movie to the end of it.  To me, she got worse not better by the end of the film, and she was supposed to seem 'helped'?<br/><br/>I give the movie a 3.5 out of 10.  Some good scenes, boring parts with dancing, horrible script, trashy sexual sequences and not at all very realistic.  But...if you like to watch freak dancing, be my guest.

Julia Stiles plays a suburban girl who moves to Chicago and must prove herself worthy to her new surroundings. The way she does this is by learning how to dance in a different way she's used to. This movie's interracial love story was filled with such irrelevant teen drama that it made me sick. The so called ""sad"" scenes in the movie were worthless time crunchers, and the movie's attempt at motivating young suburban white girls (who have never even talked to a black person in their entire life) to shake their stuff when they go to their teenybopper dance clubs is complete bullsh*t.

","I had no real information about the film's story, i.e. I didn't realise it was about ballet before hip hop dancing, but it was when I saw the scene spoofed in Scary Movie 2 that I really got into it more. Basically Sara Johnson (The Bourne Trilogy and 10 Things I Hate About You's Julia Stiles) was once an aspiring ballet dancer, but her dream to become a professional was cut short by the death of her mother, and since she has moved in with her father Roy (Terry Kinney). He lives in a predominantly Black neighbourhood, and she has to be transferred to a new school where she is one of the few White students. She finds a friend with small-time ghetto girl Chenille Reynolds (The Last King of Scotland's Kerry Washington), and later she gets to see Sara's ballet ability. Later after starting a friendship with Chenille's brother Derek (Cruel Intentions' Sean Patrick Thomas), he teaches her how her ballet skills can be put to use for an audition (the one she could have had if not for her mother's death). In a really cool scene he teaches some small cool moves, like the spoof in Scary Movie 2, and as time goes by, she gains more and more hip hop moves till she has a routine for the judges. There is the small quarrel between Sara and Derek before this audition happens, but she sticks it out, they make up, and she makes a very good impression with the judges mixing ballet with a bit of hip hop. Also starring Fredro Starr as Malakai, Bianca Lawson as Nikki, Vince Green as Snookie and Garland Whitt as Kenny. Stiles and Thomas are attractive leads, the dance sequences, especially the all important audition are fun to watch, and the soundtrack (including songs from Fatman Scoop, Ice Cube and Blaqout) is very good, and not too much sentimentality to sour the film, a crowd-pleasing dance/music film.

","Julia Stiles is an immensely talented actress, but a very poor dancer. An inherent flaw then, before we even begin. She doesn't look or move like a dancer, and appears seriously out of place in a hip-hop club. Director Thomas Carter has a string of successful TV shows to his name, and sadly this supposed 'movie' screams 'TV' from every angle. It just doesn't have any depth, and boasts a seriously dodgy 'TV drama-style' score. It skirts right around some interesting and important social & economic issues, preferring instead to attempt to create an illusion of hip-hop, street-gang cool - which it fails miserably to succeed with. Far too wishy-washy, almost apologetic in handling potentially gritty situations. When actors of the calibre of Stiles, Thomas, Lawson, Kinney etc etc are wasted in this manner, it is nothing short of a travesty."

","Save the last Dance is one of many dance movies, released in 2001, directed by Thomas Charter. The movie is about a ballerina who is forced to move to the streets of Chicago with her dad when her mom unexpectedly dies. She as though she doesnt fit because shes the schools only ""white girl."" Along the way she meets friends who teach her the art of hip hop dance, which eventually helps her accomplish her dream of going to Juilliard to study dance.<br/><br/>First, Sara (Julia Stiles) is introduced on a train on her way to Chicago, while shes riding she has flashbacks about the day she found out that her mother was killed in a car accident. She soon arrives at her dad's apartment in the ""hood"" of, she doesn't know that well since her mother and father divorced when she was a child. Sara has to sleep in the living room because the second bedroom was under construction. The next day Sara arrives at her new school and has a bit of a culture shock when she realizes that she is the only person at the school who was not of color. Sara starts off to a rocky start when shes get into a debate with her new love interest Derek (Sean Patrick).<br/><br/>Next, Sara gets invited to a club night by her new friend, Chenille (Kerry Washington), also Derek's little sister. When they arrive at the party Sara sees Derek and they both try to start off on another foot. At the party the dance and have fun but are rudely interrupted when Derek gets into a fight while helping his best friend, Malakai (Fredro Starr). This leads to Derek walking Sara home and them ending the night off with a kiss. Sara continues to get used to her new home while Derek gives her lessons on hip hop dancing.<br/><br/>Finally, Sara and Derek start their new relationship while Sara and her father try to rekindle theirs. Derek helps Sara prepare for her audition for Juilliard, and Sara begins to feel at home in Chicago. In the final scene of the movie Sara kills her audition at Juilliard by incorporating her newly learned hip hop moves with her ballae. The movies ends with Sara, Chenelle, Derek and a couple of other friends celebrating at the club where they first started.<br/><br/>This was one of the first major films for Julia Stiles, in fact this is the first film that i've ever seen her play in. All of the acting throughout the film seems very genuine, I think that the whole audience could forget that these actors are acting! Sean Patrick, who plays Derek seems very at home in the films set in Chicago. In fact this is not the only film that he has been in that takes place in Chicago. He plays in each of Ice Cubes Barber Shop which set in Chicago. Kerry Washington who plays Chenille in the film seems just a little bit off. Only because i've never seen her play the role of anyone who isn't sophisticated and proper. So its different to see her play the role of a teen mom from the South side of Chicago.<br/><br/>I think the main message that the film is trying to get across is that sometimes when bad things happen, better things are to come. Sara's mom died, and because of that she had to move to Chicago to live her dad. In the beginning she thought it was worse idea ever, and that her experince was going to be hell. But because of that she met new friends, or as she would say the love of her life. She got to rekindle her relationship with her dad, and she got to make her deceased mother proud by accomplishing her dream of going to Juilliard."

"cale-14","4","3","6","9 September 2007"," Save the Last Dance
","As an actress/dancer in training, I found this movie to be what so many others have adequately dubbed it: a poorly made film with glaring stereotypes. In this near-copy of Dirty Dancing, the acting by Julia Stiles is nothing short of atrocious, full of indication and melodrama, rather than real, in-the-moment expression. Stereotypes abound, with ""gangsta"" lingo and some of the most ridiculous ""fight scenes"" (i.e., the gym)I have ever seen.<br/><br/>As others have commented, the Juilliard School audition was so unbelievable I found it an insult to performers and to the establishment. The name on the placard was spelled wrong, Sara's dance was mediocre at best, and the event of a ""second chance"" at a major audition is something that simply would not happen. The added lack of credibility came from Derek's impromptu run onto the stage-and the judges' campy response. At a university audition, an interruption like Derek's likely would have ruined any chance of being accepted, and under no circumstances would there have been a sweet ""let's give closure"" response like: ""Welcome to Juilliard."" <br/><br/>The stereotypes, as many have mentioned, do more to hurt this film than to communicate its real message. It is unfortunate, in a film so intent on breaking down racial barriers, that the filmmakers chose to go to the extremist sides of both cultures, serving only to further ingrain those biases in the minds of viewers. Even more discouraging is the subtle message that is presented by Stiles-that to be accepted you must conform to those around you, even if that means going against your personal feelings or beliefs. At the beginning of the movie, Stiles obviously has her own way of dressing and behaving-by the end, she has become a sort of crossover Barbie doll, a Caucasian playing dress-up in an urban world-a choice made in direct conflict with her character's personality. So much of the film goes into emphasizing Sara's strength and independence-and yet we find that independence strangely lacking with regard to things that truly matter-leaving her a big talker, but one who manages to slink into a corner whenever trouble arises. (note: scenes where Derek's old girlfriend ""steals"" Derek on the dance floor, and the ""confrontation"" in the gym with the ex.)<br/><br/>Overall, this movie was poorly acted and hardly credible. Although there are some tender moments, the agonizing pace and predictability of the movie make it little more than a throwaway summer flick. A waste of time for avid moviegoers and a joke to dedicated performers."

This one's for all those white teens who long to be Black For a Night and want to be reassured that black teens are Funny When They're Randy, and all those black teens who want to show off how great they dance. Julia Stiles gives her all, as usual, but with material and direction this tepid she ends up seeming more irritated than anything else, even before the obligatory slo-mo leap into her lover's arms. Sean Patrick Thomas is by turns thrilling and smarmy in a plot that requires him to be too many different people at once (and shouldn't actors be banned from using three generic first names? Sean Patrick Thomas, Robert Sean Leonard, Neil Patrick Harris--how are we supposed to tell them apart, besides that one of them played Doogie Howser?)That prize of a supporting actor Terry Kinney goes to waste in an enigmatically boring role. And whatever happened to black directors who were searching for their own style rather than content with imitating after-school specials?"

"jpt27","Null","3","6","2 January 2002"," Hilariously, spectacularly, cringingly bad
","Warning : contains spoilers, and damning criticism.<br/><br/>Save the Last Dance had me Save Up my Best Cusswords until I could leave the cinema and scream, partly with laughter and partly with shellshocked disbelief about how bad the film was.<br/><br/>First of all : the plot. A white girl (Julia Stiles) and a black man (Sean Patrick Thomas) develop a relationship. Why does this have to be such an issue? Sure, it's not one that's tackled in cinema very often, but due to a good reason: it's not interesting enough to hold up a film for 110 minutes, unless the acting is superb and the metaphorical/symbolic play is also well integrated. I bet you can guess how well Save the Last Dance accomplishes this. The story is so cliched that I found myself hedging predictions every quarter hour and smiling when they came up. Okay - so Sara has a big dance contest coming up. Oh my! She has suddenly split with her boyfriend the night before. Will she dance badly for the first half, and then will her boyfriend show up and transform the performance to an Olympic gold for the second half? Imagine an entire film full of this standard of storytelling direness and you're coming close.<br/><br/>The acting is about as good as it could be for two B-listers who look as though they are embarrassed to be there and are trying to secure their next role between takes. There is no heartfelt interaction between the leads, and incidentally, doesn't Sean Patrick Thomas look about five years too old for the role?<br/><br/>The moral of the film is cringingly condascending. It seems to be: Drugs are bad kids so don't take drugs, and gangs are bad kids so don't be in gangs. If you want to see a film that actually says something intelligent about a difficult issue watch Traffic. I am reminded of another film which tried to take on this entire black/white/gangs/drugs issue, Dangerous Minds, which also was an unwatchable disaster.<br/><br/>The characters are unintentionally racist. The black characters are Derek, with his criminal background, and his buddy Malakai who wears a big puffy jacket, backwards baseball cap and excessive jewellery, and drives round the 'hood fighting turf wars and pulling off drivebys. Why don't they just call the character Negro Jim and have him live in a wooden shack in Alabama, playing his banjo on the porch and shouting ""Woman! Where's ma fried chicken."" I'm sorry, but racial stereotyping to this degree is unacceptable in such a modern film. Did anybody else actually feel insulted?<br/><br/>
What had me rolling in the aisles with laughter was the final dance scene at the end, where Sara is trying to get into some academy or other. The sequence goes on for a good five minutes and yet is entirely composed of around three hundred tiny, tiny clips about a half second long. Usually they show one arm movement, one leg movement, perhaps a half twirl, etc. I soon realised why it was filmed in this bizarre way - the actress, Julia Stiles, obviously could not dance for toffee (WHY CHOOSE HER FOR A FILM ABOUT DANCING?) and so they had to film the entire sequence in carefully coached one-second takes and laboriously edit it all together so it would play in time to the music. It all gives one flat, unemotive, lacklustre dance routine. May I remind you that the dance sequences were supposed to be the selling point of this film.<br/><br/>The other selling point is meant to be the soundtrack. I'm not going to quote the entire 'Why You Shouldn't Have Contemporary Hits In Films' macro but I will ask this: When was the last time a chart hit enhanced a film? I like to keep my music and my film separate. I also like to keep my face and my vomit bag separate, which is why I give this film two stars out of ten (at least it's short) and give it my Least Recommended Film of 2000 trophy."

","I gave this 6/10 because it was quite slow moving. The saving grace was Julia Stiles performance, especially in the audition scene at the end. However if you are 15-25 , and like hip hop, then it would be worth an 8/10.<br/><br/>I am not a hip hop fan, nor particularly like the music. However just as 20 years ago similar theme films-cultural conflict & generation gap films like Flashdance & Dirty Dancing, and before that Saturday Night Fever, would have appealed to late teens early 20's going out on dates, then this is a similar feel good date film.<br/><br/>The dance scenes in the night club were very ordinary. The lead characters were lost, and scarcely highlighted, unlike those other films were the lead characters performed at length on own with lots of floor space.<br/><br/>As I said the saving grace was Julia Stiles and her dance audition performance at the end.<br/><br/>Boston Public The previous evening I watched an episode of Boston Public, and the school scenes, character development, story lines , a lot better than Save The last Dance.<br/><br/>Flashdance I am sure as Flashdance stood out so 20 years later still watchable, so will this film.

"lincbertelli9","6","3","7","30 September 2005"," Last Dance Saved... Just
","Dance films are a genre not often touched by filmmakers, possibly because of their limited target audience. With the exception of musicals, which revolve more around singing than dancing, this genre hasn't provided too many highlights. Sure, we have seen highlights with 'Saturday Night Fever' and 'Dirty Dancing', but when Thomas Carter attempted to resurrect a genre lying down to rot, he didn't quite create a film up there to rival the greats.<br/><br/>Carter has created a dance film although the overriding genre in the film is romantic drama. The film revolves around Sara (Julia Stiles) a white, well-off teenage girl who is forced to move to a stereotypical black neighbourhood in Chicago following her mother's passing in a car accident. She there meets Chenille (Kerry Washington), a black teenage girl and soon falls for Chenille's brother Derek (Sean Patrick Thomas). The viewers are able to see the struggles Sara goes through to fit in to this neighbourhood where she is a different race, skin colour, gender and class to the other important characters in the film, as well as trying to achieve her dream of being accepted into the lucrative dance school Julliard.<br/><br/>Stiles, Washington and Thomas do a very good job in this film and it is refreshing to see such solid performances from actors not quite up there with Hollywood's A-List. It is relieving to see no comedic errors from the cast of 'Save The Last Dance', although at one point, Derek's efforts at motivating Sara are almost laughable as he attempts to sound positive and confident.<br/><br/>When you delve deeper into 'Save The Last Dance', it becomes evident which themes Carter was trying to portray his beliefs on to us viewers. Through the character Sara, we are able to see Carter's beliefs on race, gender and class and the struggles and exclusions you can face when you don't fit into the dominant and expected stereotype of the society you are living in. Sara is of a different race, gender and class to the majority of the other characters in the film and as a result, she tries to change herself to be included with, and fit into the society she has moved to in Chicago. Sara's actions do not auger well with the film's motto of 'The Only Person You Need To Be Is Yourself'. Sara almost completely contradicts this and humiliates the tag-line.<br/><br/>In conclusion, I found 'Save The Last Dance' to be enjoyable to watch and I was impressed with the quality of performances displayed from actors not in Hollywood's top group. The film however, did not break any new ground and despite Carter's best effort to resurrect the dance film, this effort will not go down as one of the greats. If you are a movie buff who will watch anything you can lay your hands on, this will be a great film to add to your collection of viewed films. If you only watch films every now and then, I wouldn't recommend rushing out and getting it as your weekly video as there will probably be something better. Still, 'Save The Last Dance' was a good film and I would rate it a 3 out of 5."
"rbverhoef","7","3","7","8 August 2003"," Hip-hop Stiles
","'Save the Last Dance' is an enjoyable movie. It has a set-up that we have seen so many times, but after a while little surprises pop up. It is funny too. The movie is about a white girl Sara (Julia Stiles) who once liked ballet and a black guy Derek (Sean Patrick Thomas) who likes hip-hop music. Sara just moved to Chicago to live with her father Roy (Terry Kinney). Her mother died in a car crash. She was on her way to see an audition of Sara, and therefor she thinks it his her fault her mother died. In Chicago she goes to a school with mainly black people. This is where she meets Chenille (Kerry Washington) and her brother, Derek. On a party she tries to dance with Derek on hip-hop music but it isn't really her style. Derek wants to teach her how to dance and after a while they are falling in love with each other.<br/><br/>Although all this sounds very familiar there a things here you wouldn't expect. Or you would expect them but they just don't happen. Example: there is a scene with Derek and Sara, in her house, where Sara's father is not supposed to be home for a while. You expect certain things to happen, you probably know what I mean, but it never does happen. Also, the characters feel more like real people than you normally see in a movie like this. They have real emotions and they can think for themselves. There are very funny moments too, the scenes where Sara starts her hip-hop training are great. I am not a big fan of the hip-hop music but in this movie it was pretty good, just because of the images with it.<br/><br/>Of course there are some familiar and expected points in the movie. Sara has to pick up her ballet again and Derek has a criminal friend who is not a big fan of Sara. These things is what you expect in a movie like this. But normally you see only this kind of things and I was glad to see that 'Save the Last Dance' didn't settle for them. There was one thing that bothered me. Julia Stiles and Sean Patrick Thomas give very good performances, but where Stiles was really young, Thomas was already in his thirties. He was good, but there must have been a younger actor more suitable for the job. Despite this little thing it is a very enjoyable and entertaining movie, with some intelligence as well."

The skinny, very paleskinned Julia Stiles fit optimally into her role, I especially liked it how good she was able to express her troubles with her mothers death. I liked the acting of everybody else in this movie, too. I'm not able to judge how good or bad the dancing was, but at least it was not too bad.<br/><br/>In the sum, it was a very nice movie, better than I had thought, but it was as decent as I had thought.

","The first time I'd seen this film was at a theatre in Los Angeles. Went with friends who were looking to see dance or Sean Patrick Thomas or Julia Stiles or both. The audience was mix of fans of the main actors & others who were fans of of hip hop or ballet or the joy of dance or romance or curious folks like me. The whole audience fell in love with the wonderful dancing, the relationships, the visceral fight of friends to be friends. We humans too often don't bother to fight to treasure & preserve the gift of true friends. The dance, the mix of classic ballet & hiphop was joyous. The bigotry against certain economic & interracial friendships are still inherent in our all too often class & bigoted based culture. True then & now. There is a lot of truth in this film. Of hardship due to personal loss, of economic & racial divide, of the lack of acceptance & freedom to live your gifted talent for all to see. Young people who aren't the desired shade or grade, that aren't given a free ride or those that do have that free ride but don't conform to the separatism our divided culture seems to demand, have a more difficult struggle. I adore this film. You may not. I do know that it should be seen."

","Save the Last Dance (2001): Dir: Thomas Carter / Cast: Julia Stiles, Sean Patrick Thomas, Kerry Washington, Terry Kinney, Bianca Lawson: Recycled drivel about the differences in cultures and styles. Title regards the ability to not give up on what is important. Too bad the screenwriter didn't do the same. Julia Stiles plays a student who used to be a dancer but after her mother died in a car accident on her way to an audition she has since left that passion. She gets settled in with her father and goes to an urban school where most of the students are black. Director Thomas Carter does a fine job with a screenplay laden with obvious clichés but it is a far cry from his wasted efforts with Metro. Stiles is a wonderful performer but she is basically following a laid out track that will end where we know it. Sean Patrick Thomas is the black male she becomes involved with whom encourages her to continue dancing. Kerry Washington plays her best friend who happens to be Thomas's sister. She is a mother dealing with an irresponsible father to her baby. Terry Kinney as Stiles's father is one note at best. Bianca Lawson plays Thomas's ex-girlfriend whose role predictably has her starting a confrontation with Stiles and just plainly being a pain in the ass. Its theme regarding interracial relationships is weighted under familiarity. Save your money as oppose to the last dance with this drivel. Score: 2 / 10"
"marlyly","6","2","4","4 October 2008"," All dance films seem to follow the exact same formula, but this one stands out as one of the best
","I think the title pretty much sums up what I'm going to say in this review. I finally got around to watching 'Save the Last Dance', becoming quite tired of the 'How can you not have seen 'Save the Last Dance', it's the best dance film out there!' comments each time the film came up in conversation. And yes, I enjoyed it, it was a good, entertaining film, but it definitely was not one of the greatest things ever created and I don't think it deserves quite as much hype as it receives.<br/><br/>The story line has become a cliché by now, girl and boy become romantically involved against a backdrop of dancing. I think that this was one of the first dance films of it's kind though, and you can almost feel that throughout the movie - it feels fresh and original, not like a carbon copy of an already done and dusted formula (such as 'How She Move' felt). Also, I think it's important to mention how influential this film was in encouraging more dance films to be made, some of them rather good too, like Step Up 1 + 2, Take the Lead, etc. However, by now the formula wears thin, and has been done too many times, so even whilst this film was one of the first in it's genre, a viewer watching this for the first time these days already knows what will happen at the end less than 10 minutes into the film, and that's definitely a let down (though, it's hardly a fault that the movie could have prevented, without foresight).<br/><br/>The dancing is not the greatest I have ever seen in this genre of film, that would have to go, hands down, to the street-dancing in Step Up 2 (and I do believe that the ballet in Step Up 1 probably deserves second place) but it is good enough for the film, and definitely not the worse I have seen. In fact, Sara's final dance may be one of my favourite routines ever seen on film. I was very surprised to discover Julia Stiles was such a capable, and very skilled ballet dancer - her dancing impressed me far more than her acting in this film (which, although wasn't necessarily bad, was more of her same old style - it's as if she plays the same person in each role, who just happens to be in a completely new situation each time). Kerry Washington also impressed me as the confident, mouthy, and good at heart Chenille and I believe Sean Patrick Thomas also deserves a mention as Derek, as does Fedro Starr as Malakai.<br/><br/>Overall, I did like this film, it was fast paced, intelligent, easy watching, and a welcome change to the recent films I have been watching lately which all feel much slower, and emotionally heavy. However, the plot gives this film it's limitations, and although for it's genre it is up there with the best, it's not a film that I would say deserves to be forever remembered in film history. But that again, there are only a few that do."
"laiks","2","2","4","8 October 2006"," not convincing
","Although, I am a huge fan of dance-movies, this one was not even close to the top. First, there lead-role's actress was not appropriate for the movie. She was not convincing  she did not show the attitude, no feelings (happiness, sadness). And what about her hairstyle? The best of it was, when she had the shirt around her hair. The improvement must be done in women casting, because men were real! They showed how the acting is done, how to show hate, friendship and love. And the best of all about them is that they could dance. The best of girl dancers was Nikki, though she did not have to dance a lot. Returning again to the lead-actress, her last dance was not convincing. I mean, where were emotions? Where was the passion? Where was the relief that the dance was going well? No facial expressions, no feelings what so ever. No difference between the obligated dance and her chosen one.<br/><br/>Thus, if you are fan of dance-movies, you should watch it for the sake of your portfolio. Otherwise, there are plenty of better movies out there about the theme."

","Spoilers Herein.<br/><br/>My two young actresses to watch are Kate Winslet and the girl here, Julia Stiles. I first saw her as Ophelia, and was stunned. So I followed her to a silly teenage movie and saw some confidence and charm. This is an ordinary film for children in every way except for her. <br/><br/>But Kate and Julia couldn't be more different: Winslet is more disciplined, internal. Stiles doesn't have that, and may never. She is external -- wearing her role on her body rather than projecting it from within. Thus, her intent cannot be projected from scene to scene. But so many people `acting' in `real' life today carry their own personality on the outside anyway: that to me is what characterizes HipHop. So her style (sorry!) fits this story. We'll have to see if this is the careful planning of an intelligent actress (and her coach), or exuberant, undisciplined talent.<br/><br/>But at least here -- where that exuberance colors outside the lines -- is an honest manner of acting that I find really refreshing, and risky. Her carriage is like a young Sigourney Weaver, but is carried with more grace. She does most of the dancing here (which is not world class) but the real dancing is when she isn't.<br/><br/>Strangely, of all the possibilities that a moving camera offers in filming dance, the dance sequences here are filmed rather conventionally. This is MTV creativity?<br/><br/>But some MTV guy is hip, and wrote in a decorated box of `remembrances' to mirror that from her 45 rpm carrying case in `Hamlet.'<br/><br/>As an aside, the lead black male receives admittance to Georgetown, presumably on merit. It would have been better (have fit the story better) to have named a school that doesn't hire illiterate ghetto kids to play sports for their amusement."

The movie is like a 2-hour long music video that's played on MTV 24/7! Julia Stiles and Sean Patrick Thomas have absolutely no chemistry! I couldn't believe those two could fall in love. Almost all the actors seem to overact; I cannot think of anyone who seemed at ease with his/her role, except maybe that girl who played Derrek's sister. And Julia Stiles has got to be one of the more overrated actress. I can't tell the difference between Sara and her character in ""Down To You"".<br/><br/>
""Save The Last Dance"" tries so hard to be hip, it's sad. Every single line the actors are made to say just TOTALLY scream, ""HEY LOOK AT THEM! THEY'RE COOL! YOU SHOULD BE LIKE THAT TOO!"" ""Save The Last Dance"" takes itself way too seriously. And what a bad thing to do, considering there isn't even a bloody PLOT! I think it's great that it tries to address the racism issue, but I'm sorry, it failed terribly. Like someone else has said it has too many sub-plots and too many ideas to raise until it gets lost in them and the result?

These two main charactors are good role models for teens, because they are color blind and look for the best in everyone and are focused on the long run and academics."

","As I look at others negative comments it makes me sad that they would waste their time destroying it and putting down such a great movie. ""Save the Last Dance"" is one of my favorite movies-on a personal note-and it hit home for me in so many ways. The music, the story line, the beginning, middle, and end in every way touched all my emotions. Going to see this movie I expected another teenage flick with a cool, mellow story, but I walked out of the theater-3 times-each time with such an uplifting sense. It shows that anyone can do anything that they put their mind to, be yourself, and things do happen for a reason.The drama, romance, musical, and teenage aspect of this movie just was totally ""kick ass."" I could go on and on about the brillance of this movie, but won't and would just like to say: for the ""know it all"" critics out there who put this movie down and ""speak for all of us""; Just save it and let us enjoy this wonderfully, inspirational, entertaining movie."

","The movie is about dancing first.  In the production notes it was indicated that it has been a long time since a movie like a Flashdance or DirtyDancing was made.  And those movies did well.<br/><br/>And while this movie did touch on a lot of racial issues and never really addressed them fully I wasn't too disappointed about it.  I never thought the character of Sarah acted outside herself.  I never thought she was trying to be black (even some may have thought that).<br/><br/>I liked the movie for realness of Sarah and Derrick relationship.  It did seem like a genuine attraction and not a physical attraction in which a lot of people get caught up in.  And the dancing and music was off the hook  I never thought this movie was meant to address the racial issues but to make people more aware of them."

"RResende","Null","1","2","2 October 2008"," external ballet
","This is a teen movie. This means it works under strict formulas, ruled by market and by what the big bosses of Hollywood think teenagers want. There is a big contradiction behind the majority of these teens movies.: In most cases (this is no exception) these films tell stories of people who try to outdo themselves. These characters try to make special things, to get over the underdeveloped environments (socially, culturally, economically) from which they come from. So, ordinary people trying to reach special goals, trying to be special people. But than, all these films are perfectly ordinary, made massively, one copying the other, with absolutely nothing special beyond any of them. This one doesn't totally enter that kind of film for one redeeming element, but it practically does it.<br/><br/>Here, the female character is someone whose attempt to grab her personal dreams led her (in her view) to a personal downfall, her male match is someone who fits perfectly the stereotype i described above. The matching of one against the other and the conflict this generates is mildly interesting, though not enough to take the film out of its vulgarity. The redeeming element is how dance is used to illustrate this contradiction. Ballet vs hip-hop, internal vs external forms of expression. I frankly thought Julia Stiles didn't go well in this part. She was strangely stiff and uneasy. She has a sober way of acting, but here it sounds like if she wasn't quite sure of how to express, like if she couldn't ""dance"". Yet the idea of placing dance as a displayer of characters attitudes towards their reality and what happened/may happen to them was interesting. The overall product was quite flawed.<br/><br/>My opinion: 2/5 interesting concept<br/><br/>http://www.7eyes.wordpress.com"
"casey_choas66","Null","1","2","2 January 2003"," **1/2 out of 5
","Saying that this film is a musical would be like saying Fight Club was a kung fu flick. When this film first hit the street I didn't think there would be anyway that it could be taken seriously. But it became a huge surprise hit and raked in big bucks at the box office. So now, years after its release I decided to see what all the fuss was about, I didn't find much. We open the film with a truly heart-breaking scene of Sara riding on a train while she flashes back to her mom's death when driving to her ballet addition. This scene hit me hard. It was very sad but yet had a sense of reality in it that couldn't be ignored. The rest was downhill from there. Sara then moves in with her dad. He lives in a run down neighbourhood full of sex, drugs and violence. I guess you could say it came from a scene right out of Boyz N' the Hood (easily the most powerful blacksplotion film ever made). This helps to unfold the rest of the film. If you think I have short changed you on the plot description I will certainly agree that I have. You may be interested in what happens to here once she moves, what kind of troubles does she meet up with along the way and mostly what does any of this have to do with dancing? I would love to answer all those questions in this review but that would be impossible. You see after that opening scene this film takes so many different turns and plot twists that it is almost impossible to follow and even harder to care about. There is something new presented in every scene and dropped just a quickly in the next. I criticized 8 Mile for doing this as well but the difference is that 8 Mile stayed to one basic story, it just didn't developed anything within the context of that story to be interesting. This film jumps all over the place and instead of having one solid message it tries to preach about to many different things. We hear about the bad relationship between a father, the shattered dreams, the blaming of ones self for the death of a loved one, teen parenting, reaching out to achieve your goals, not caring about what other people think about you, racial barriers and a message about gang violence. Still wondering what all this has to do with dancing? The answer is nothing. The dancing is only thrown in as a way to disguise the fact that this film never had a clue where it is going and has even less of one about where it will end up. Filmmakers knew this film was geared toward teenagers so it seems like all they are doing is throwing a story about dancing to cover up the fact that this film does not flow together at all. The best example is when Sara first sees Derek she thinks he is a complete jerk. The next time we see the two on screen together they have instantly fallen in love with each other. We are given no explanation as to their feeling for each other or how they grew to be this way, it just simple happened. Almost all the other subject matter presented follows this same pattern. But the film does work in talking about the racial barriers between blacks and whites. Even though the love story between Sara and Derek didn't do a thing for the film it was nice to see that it wasn't looked on as a conventional relationship and that a lot of people do look down on these types of things. Also the messages about violence and knowing when to walk away were very effective for me, the problem is that they weren't dealt upon enough or didn't fit into the story. If films makers wanted to make a film about violence they should have made one about violence and stick to that. There are so many things going on in here I found myself more interesting in what was going on in the world around them than the actual characters themselves. In fact I didn't feel for any characters in this film at all. Watching the characters in this film is like watching a horror film like the Candayman and seeing that very same hook handed killer in a slapstick comedy. Different characters are needed to suit different environments but. Sara and Derek always seem to be at the heart of everything that is going on. Their moods never change with the flow of the film. It seemed that whenever they would have a romantic moment the film would instantly switch into suspense mode but the audience is still left with the feeling of romance. Don't get me wrong, the acting is not bad. Julia Stiles is a very talented young actress who I can see big things for in the future. He holds this whole film together because she allows her emotions to change freely from scene to scene and is able to show all the pain she is going through but also allows us to get into the lighter side of her life. Sean Patrick Thomas on the other had is not suited for this role. The whole time I was watching him I could only think of how much this film could have benefited if that part was given to someone like Mekhi Phifer. Hey if he could keep 8 Mile from falling apart I'm sure he could do the same for this film. Another thing that bothers me about this film is its tag line "" The Only Person You Need To Be Is Yourself."" Nowhere in the film is that presented at all. Sara goes into her new environment as a smart intelligent type. She then conforms to the ways of her black friends in order for her to be accepted. The character we see at the start of this film is not the same one we see at the end and that bothered me, especially considering all the film trailers depicted a girl having to face her past in order to become her present. Maybe that is talked about in the film, and maybe teen girls will be able to buy into that. But after seeing plot hole after plot hole I found that message nowhere within the film (I guess whoever was in charge of marketing did a good job, it must have been the same people who did it for 8 Mile). I am yet again going to compare this film to 8 Mile because I feel both are sending out terrible messages. Both seem to be saying that in order to be excepted by the public you have to be someone/something that you aren't. This is most notable in the last scene (the dance audition) but I am not going to give the ending away so you're going to have to figure that one out yourself. It is nice to see that MTV is trying to say something with the films they put out. I don't know about anyone else but I didn't find any deep, life changing messages in Joe's Apartment or Dead Man on Campus, but they are going about it totally wrong. They have tried to put a message from a film like Boyz... into a film that will be marketable to teens. Maybe if MTV were more worried about what is being into the film and not how they will sell it we may have had a winner on our hands, but because of its candy coated theories and watered down statements it doesn't come close to hitting the mark."

The soundtrack of this movie is lamentable, Sean Patrick Thomas is a terrible teeny-bopper actor, and is overall a pathetic human being.

","I'd heard a lot about this movie, so I expected it to be pretty good... but I was very disappointed. The only thing I really enjoyed about this movie was the soundtrack, which had some great hip hop and r'n'b songs on it, and the dancing was fun to watch. I found the plot a little too mixed up for my tastes - the movie tried to cover a lot of issues (a white girl fitting into a black neighbourhood, lack of opportunities for people living in such a neighbourhood, bi-racial relationships, being a teenage single mother and the death of a parent) but I felt it just skimmed over them briefly as sub-plots to try and add some substance to a pretty thin story. I found the whole movie a rather unsatisfactory affair, with nothing really being resolved apart from the movie's ""heroine"", Sara, being accepted at top dance school Julliard. The acting wasn't bad, but I felt Julia Stiles was miscast as Sara - she didn't seem very comfortable with the role, and appeared rather stiff. There also seemed to be a complete lack of chemistry between her and Derek, her on-screen boyfriend, which, if it had existed may have made up for some of the movie's other shortcomings. Overall, a very schmaltzy, cliched affair with no real substance or anything (except for the soundtrack) worthy of merit. A huge disappointment."

(and I realize the irony of being hurtful and mean-spirited towards a movie when I say I'm not a judgemental person, but hey, this movie deserves it in spades).<br/><br/>MTV, perhaps one of television's lowest forms of entertainment (should I actually call it entertainment?), produces a new, hip movie for the teenage crowd. One with ""slammin"" dancing, insightful (ha!) looks into interracial relationships and, well, if you can't tell that I'm being sarcastic, you need to go bang your head on the driveway.<br/><br/>Where to start? I shouldn't even be giving this wretched excuse for a movie the time of day, but seeing as just about every lame-brained teen across the friggin' United States and the world beyond have given this movie their weak thumbs up and seal of approval, I just have to ask, why?<br/><br/>A white girl moves to a black majority town, and, through a series of painful, shmaltzy and MTV contrivances, learns to be black from her new, hip, black boyfriend, who also teaches the girl the true lesson of life (never give up on your dreams - ugh), and the art of hip hop dance. Oy.<br/><br/>To insinuate this girl made it into Julliard is downright insulting, as there are tons of dancers out there much better than her hippin' and a hoppin' who struggle just to make it to a community college! But hey, this is MTV for ya, and I never said anyone there had the brains to write a *real* story.<br/><br/>What irked me the most about this dough-headed movie was the plot. I'd like to see a movie where a black girl moves to a white town and learns to be white. The opening of the movie would draw black rights activists a mile long, saying that it could even be made in this PC day and age.<br/><br/>I'm going off track, but rightfully so... This movie gives me a headache just to think about it, so I'll go and say, don't waste your time, money or energy seeing this garbage when there are real movies out there, like Traffic, Unbreakable and Snatch, ironically three movies that never made it to the number one spot, whilst this one did.

More like Oliansky's The Competition (1980) in somber tones regarding a piano competition than Glaser's The Cutting Edge (1992) with its more lighter, syrupy romance drama regarding an ice skating competition. The emotional knot with Stile's character's mother's dream is a humbling and strong theme that resonates throughout the movie.<br/><br/>There is plenty of creative and artful moves more so than in The Cutting Edge. Add the fascinating yet more subdued culture clashes reminiscent of The Princess Diaries (2001), Save The Last Dance offers a satisfying and entertaining experience worth the time and money."

"oOoBarracuda","8","1","3","30 November 2016"," Save the Last Dance
","Save the Last Dance is a film I can put on anytime, regardless of my mood, and enjoy it. The Thomas Carter film from 2001, is not a light film by any means, dealing with race relations and the death of a young girl's mother and her drive to overcome the associated guilt she feels as responsible for her mother's death. Starring Julia Stiles and Sean Patrick Thomas, Save the Last Dance is one I enjoy because its subject matter never loses its relevance, and the human emotions are presented in a very real way affecting the audiences with every viewing. <br/><br/>Sara Johnson (Julia Stiles), has always dreamed of being a ballerina, her mother has always been wholly supportive of her dreams, which is why it was so important to Sara that her mother was present at her audition for Julliard. Her mother, a florist with an incredibly busy schedule and informs Sara that she will be unable to attend her audition. Sara is devastated and begs her mother to adjust her schedule and be there for her big moment. Her mother is unable to turn her down and commits to being there. As Sara begins her audition, she is saddened to not see her mother in the audience and goes on unsuccessfully to complete her audition. A trooper informs Sara after her audition that her mother has been killed in an accident. Sara drops to the floor in despair, and her life is uprooted. Sara now has to move to be with a father she barely knows who has been absent most of her life and resume in a high school in an impoverished urban area of town. Sara has lived a homogeneous existence up to this point in her life and hasn't experienced much diversity so her new school and address are an incredible culture shock for her. After a tough adjustment, Sara is finally befriended by Chenille (Kerry Washington) who takes her under her wing, introducing her to friends at school and taking her to the hot dance club where a majority of students spend their free time. Sara also meets Chenille's brother Derek, a smart young man who must overcome the negative influences of the friends he surrounds himself with so he can better his life and attend Georgetown University. Derek decides to teach Sara the kind of dancing she will need to blend in at the dance club, and the two quickly fall in love. Throughout their union, Derek discovers the passion and talent Sara has for ballet and works with her to encourage her to resume her passion and audition for Julliard again. Sara is reluctant, as she feels she cannot make such a big step without her mother, but the confidence Derek bestows upon her may be the final push she needs to succeed. In a time and place in which interracial relationships are not looked upon highly, Derek and Sara must decide if their love for one another is worth overcoming the many stumbling blocks their relationship faces. <br/><br/>Julia Stiles plays the complicated emotionally charged part of Sara quite well. Sean Patrick Thomas just exudes charisma each moment he is on-screen and shares an infectious chemistry with Stiles. Kerry Washington drives the story quite well, proving that she was just as brilliant of an actress we know her to be now 15 years ago. The score and choreography are spellbinding and takes up most of the film, while simultaneously driving a beautiful story. Oftentimes, in a teen dancing movie, the plot is neglected for the dancing, but that problem does not occur in Save the Last Dance, thankfully. While it does not enjoy much critical acclaim, I found the film an enjoyable narrative dealing with tough issues as suppressed guilt and interracial relationships in a meaningful and powerful way."

I found the latter part interesting because it is relatively uncommon to see in movies and I thought that part in the movie worked very well. As for the dancing, it's not too bad and the choreography is halfway decent. <br/><br/>Thomas Carter's film is about a girl named Sara who dreams to be a ballerina are shattered when an unfortunate family tragedy occurs and she is forced to move to the other side of town, where the town is predominantly black.

","Um, what is with the burning trash cans? My friends and I are sitting here cracking up over the ridiculous number of flaming trash cans seen every time anyone steps outside. We're in Chicago right now, and in the past three years of living on the south side, we have yet to see any trash cans on fire. So, what the heck? Was this a director's joke? Also, this movie generally reads like a health class lecture. Kids, don't get pregnant before you can pay for your baby, and don't play with guns. Obviously, these are important, serious issues, but this movie kind of makes them seem ridiculous. <br/><br/>By the way, I can't think of much else to say, but apparently I have to write a novella about this movie. So, in conclusion, the trash cans are absurd and distracting, and unrealistically portray life in the city."
"lloyd_lynne","8","1","3","6 March 2006"," The Great Dance
","In this review I choose Save the Last Dance. The message I received from this film review is never give up on dreams, also stay true to others. Once decided on what life may bring,just go for it and never give up. Sara Johnson (Julia Stiles), a regular student in high school, dreams of becoming a ballerina. While Sara is performing, her mother has a horrible car accident and dies. In that moment Sara's dream came crashing down, until she moved with her father (Terry Kinney) on the south side of Chicago. Sara's dream started to become true once again when she meets Derek Reynolds (Sean Patrick Thomas) and his sister Chenille (Kerry Washington). Sara's impression is when things get rough she backs down. Derek was the real way of life. Those two characters came together as a couple who went through everything together, the good and bad. I really enjoyed the dancing at the club, the different moves people may come up with and the way they move their body. Having to go from one town to another would be difficult to do, but Sara did it really great. Going from a place where everybody was similar and then going to a town that was totally different form of style. Derek and Sara face their biggest challenges in life.<br/><br/>This film is a very interesting, and director Thomas Carter cast the film towards the younger crowd. Carter was demonstrating to the general public, dreams may come true and some aren't meant to come true for that person. Experience the place, time, good, or bad thing do happen. Individuals may trust people in this world and then can't trust anybody for a second. Friends may also say things, right or wrong, that isn't meant to come out. Having enough friends is the most important action in this film strip."
"sarinamaxje","10","1","3","26 February 2006"," I love this movie!
","I absolutely love Save The Last Dance! Everything about it is great. The plot, the actors and the music, everything works. The plot is both romantic and exciting. It's a good combination of love, dance and drama. The story of a white girl and a black boy coming together really appeals to me. Also the fact that Derek (Sean Patrick Thmoas) has helped Sara (Julia Stiles) to regain the confidence to start doing ballet again is very moving. I think Julia Stiles and Sean Patrick Thomas work very well together. What I especially love about Save The Last Dance is the soundtrack. My favourite song is ""U Know What's Up"" by Donnel Jones. Another great track is Be Faithful by Fatman Scoop, Crooklyn Cran and Faith Evans. When you see this movie and when you listen to the soundtrack, you just want to dance."

","I am so grateful for this forum, so that I may express my intense appreciation for this wonderful movie. I thought the portrayal of maintaining a inter-racial relationship, particularly under the pressure so prevalent in the teen years, was brilliantly done. Julia Styles is truly one of my favorite actress...and I am 48 years old! My 25 year old daughter recently bought me the soundtrack because I am crazy about the music accompanying the movie. I love it...it even plays in my head while falling asleep. A true classic.<br/><br/>What has happened to Sean Patrick Thomas?

Because It shows that everyone can make something of him self. My favorite scene is when Derek chose Sara over Malakai. That means that he really loves her an i like such films.

The emotion she portrays at losing her mother is so heart-wrenching, and you completely feel for her, whether you have faced a loss before, or not.<br/><br/>Sean Patrick Thomas was amazing too, and seemed so confident in his role, and the support Derek was for Sara is beautiful.<br/><br/>The movies been criticised about the dancing, but think of it this way - none of the cast were chosen for their dance ability, but for their acting ability - and they chose right.<br/><br/>It addresses some important issues in this movie, too, and ones that we can take away with us. About dreams, the differences that shouldn't be between us, dealing with loss....all tie into be a wonderful movie."

","I think Save the Last Dance addresses each issue it attempts very very well, including racism, self confidence or lack thereof, friendship, jealousy, hatred.. everything is wonderful. I also think Stiles and Thomas have wonderfully underrated chemistry which makes the film in that it shows each's hesitation in falling in love. Granted, I wasn't thrilled by some of the acting, but I do think the important parts are portrayed wonderfully. I was able to relate to this film, because I wish to have a career in dance, but there is a lot of opposition to that, and I also have a boyfriend who most people think is not right for me because we move in different circles. I'm fifteen, and I think that, while this movie isn't for everyone, it is a fantastic movie for many people."

Derek and Sara did a good thing by sticking together through the hard times. Derek did a good job of teaching Sara to dance. I think that Sara shouldn't of started that fight with Nicky.

","This film is not about dancing, or a white girl in a black person world... It's about an interracial relationship between Sara and Derek. Sara is played by Julia Stiles who stared in Ten things I hate About You, a teen adaption of Shakespears: Tamping of the Shrew. You can't compare the two movies, other than the fact that both of them were well liked by critics, while still being classified as ""teen movies.""<br/><br/>Stiles has what it takes to be a star in hollywood. If one thing that this movie proves, it's that Stiles will go on to bigger and better things (or atleast so I hope).<br/><br/>I have read a few reviews knocking the dialogue in the film as being simple. I thought that it was better in that way because most teen movies contain teens with quirky smart talk that never happens in real life.<br/><br/>The movie starts off simple and leads you on a journey with many twists that you don't expect. <br/><br/>Pete's Movie Rating (out of 10): 7"

This wandering, simple-minded slice of life flick doesn't show us anything new and does a poor job of showing us old stuff.

"shade_78","Null","1","3","10 April 2001"," Suffused with energy, it's everything a dance movie should be!
","Yes the film is cliched, from the new kid - new town - stand out and prove yourself scenario (footloose) to the 'you can do anything if you want it enough' (any film you care to mention) theme, it has been done and done again. But there are only 8 storylines on which to make a film so they are bound to get rehashed and good films aren't simply about originality, they're about strong performances, exciting photography, absorbing storylines and disparate elements that work together and as a whole connect with the audience. Save the Last Dance knows that it's been done before, but it also knows it's genre and it just goes there. It has a fantastic soundtrack, a wonderful sense of humour, plenty of drama and above all, wicked dance sequences. What made films like 'Flashdance' so unbearably dull was the fact that not only could the lead not dance particularly well but the dance style was so dull. Hip Hop is so fresh and innovative, it has a pulse, and even though every talentless new manufactured pop group tries their very best to dance to jump on the bandwagon, it's probably been as long as the 1980's 'Breakdance' since we last had the opportunity to see black dance represented properly. Who knows if Julia Stiles can dance but she certainly does a good impression, Sean Patrick Thomas easily makes up for anything she lacks and they are surrounded by such a strong cast that the film can't help but sparkle with the same energy that colours hip hop. Not everybody is going to like this film, but then teenage dance movies have always been a niche market; but if carefree, wonderfully choreographed dance extravaganzas are what you're into then your money could not be better spent. Grease, Dirty Dancing, Saturday Night Fever: you know that feeling when you leave the cinema buoyed up and ready to dance all night? Well this film is up there with the best of them."

","Sara loses her mother and with it her desire to dance.  She is forced to move from her predominantly white home to live with her father in the rougher part of Chicago.  Her first day at her new, predominantly black High School sees her meet Derek in class.  They do not get along immediately, but she becomes friends with his sister Chenille and she learns that Derek is a brilliant student and is going to medical college when he graduates.  They start to date although this does not go down well with everyone, Derek dating a white girl is not popular within his black neighbourhood.  This film explores prejudice from both sides of the community.  Derek helps Sara to get back to the dance that she loves after the death of her mother and helps her with her free dance piece for her Julliard audition.  Despite a rough ride they stay together.  A good film, that shows the black and the white communities from a less stereotyped view point.  Both Stiles and Thomas give credible performances."

I think the relationship between Sarah (Julia Stiles) and Derek (Sean Patrick Thomas) is so touching and so real.  Sarah's struggle to go on dancing *and* defend her relationship with Derek is one of the best I've seen in any movie.  The dancing is beautiful as well.

It also shows the audience to stand up to your 'friends' and not to succumb to peer pressure e.g. when derrick refused to help Kai in his gang drive by shooting. <br/><br/>Although this film may be cheesy in the sense that they both get into their dream uni's and end up together it gives you hope that things will get better if you have a unhappy life."
"HelenMary","7","1","4","18 January 2013"," formulaic but uplifting, with attitude... aaaa'iiiight?? ;-)
","Nothing in this film is original, you've seen it a dozen times, but this is more than an oddball in the new-school romcom with dance thrown in. This one is more adult, it deals with real issues and it deals with them in a not very glamorous manner ie it doesn't mince it's words. This I like. The music is good, the dancing is good and so is the script. For the life of me I struggle to see Sean Patrick Thomas (SPT) without a feather 'duster' in his hand wearing silky boxers (Cruel Intentions - le Chevalier Raphael Danceny character), which to be fair isn't a crying shame on the mind's eye, but in this he is good; convincing as the ghetto boy who wants out and gets out, and who can dance! Then comes the problem. I don't particularly admire Julia Stiles as an actress, she doesn't have enough range of facial expressions and always looks sort grumpy, blank, and reading off a cheat-sheet, so I just didn't ""get"" her in this - although I did like her in Ten Things I Hate About You, and she wasn't bad per se it was just that whilst impressed that she clearly did her own dancing, I didn't see passion or feeling and that took the shine off for me. Kerry Washington was notably good as Derek's (SPT) teen-mum sister, and I really liked the quiet understated performance of Terry Kinney, Sara's estranged father. Save the Last Dance balances the emotions in the film well, and in parts it does get a bit emotional as it deals with despair, bereavement, confusion, fear, jealously, anger and loyalty, joy, exuberance, acceptance and a sort of redemption.<br/><br/>People with interest in hip-hop should like the tunes and dancing in this, and there's enough of it, with a ballet fusion, and it's the mix of drama, romance, dance, music and realism that makes this film more than the sum of it's parts, for target-audience-teens or adults. It's not just another teen movie, this has attitude!"
"stevechica-920","9","1","4","12 February 2012"," Worth a second look
","This movie is so under-rated. No, it may not be the most original storyline, but it contains so much more than a story about a girl who dances, and meets a guy that dances. It's about a girl who's trying to find her way in a life that suddenly gets turned right on its head. She loses her mom, her best friend and her biggest supporter, blaming herself for the accident that kills her mom. That amount of guilt would make anyone give up their dream, and Sarah is no different. She doesn't feel like she deserves to be happy anymore, like she should feel guilty for doing what she's always dreamed of doing, because of what happened. She's forced to live with a father she barely knows, and becomes part of a society she doesn't understand and doesn't fit into. And then comes Derek, the first person that cares enough to dig through the walls Sarah's built around herself. He's the first person to understand where she's coming from, and he helps her meld her world with his. It's a great movie. I've loved it since the first time I watched it--people shouldn't write it off so much. There's meat beneath the seemingly superficial salad on the surface."
"les6969","7","1","4","1 October 2009"," Great Film
","I have seen this film in DVD shops for ages but figured it was just a chick flick so never bothered to buy it even when it went to under £3.00 Then it came on one of the movie channels so I decided to give it a try. Now I am going to buy it next time I see it. This is a very good film, well acted by everyone and with a story that covers some difficult subjects very well indeed. I thought that Julia Styles was perfect and looked very awkward when she first started dancing hip hop but became believable just as she would have done learning from scratch a new dance form. I thought her ballet was less convincing and it even looked like there was a double in there at times. But over all an excellent film and well worth a watch."

","Julia Stiles again (as in ""10 things I hate...). While she wouldn't actually be my first choice in a dance flick, I don't think she's the wrong one. Whereas Jessica Alba in Honey -> just wrong! Too cute, no emotional depth, but that's a different story altogether. But reminds us how difficult it is, to make a music/dance movie, that actually has some story to it.<br/><br/>Most of the movies, just lay their weight on the dance scenes. And while those are fun to watch, you can't but think that you are watching a pretty long (and therefor boring) music video. The drama and the acting do elevate this one above some other efforts, but it's still not perfect. Well to me it isn't, so if you like this type of movies, you might enjoy it even more than I did."

"vposhell","8","1","4","5 December 2008"," English Comp. Move Review
","Dancing can be defined as movements done in accordance with an accompanying sound or music. Still, dancing is a limitless universal language. Being able to relate and connect to a movie requires not only a good script but a rational way to put film right into the watchers' hearts. In the movie ""Save the Last Dance"", literary, theatric, and cinematic techniques combine to enhance the message and understanding of the movie. Set in the city of Chicago the main character, Sara, embarks on a journey in a world completely different from the one she knew, getting back to who she is by overcoming hardship. She gives up dancing after her mother dies in a hurry to make it to Sarah's Julliard audition. The new school Sara attends is gritty and underprivileged emphasizing its inner city features. Another set is Sara's father's house, which she has to move too. It is decrepit and greatly contrasts to her previous sheltered and secure life. The tone is the story is sad and cathartic. The theme indulges in this tone because it is about following dreams and overcoming adversity. One grows to credit and trust Sara, allowing one to agree with Sara's judgments or views of others. The hip-hop club that Sara and her new friends always flee to clearly foreshadows the return to her passion for Ballet. One of the prime symbols is falling during a dance. Each time Sara falls during a dance piece a significant event occurs. As Sara dances her mother dies. As Sara trips, her anger overwhelms her dream. When Sara finally masters her dance the fact that she does not fall is significant to her growth not only as a dancer but as a person. One first meets Sara in dark clothes, which reflects her inner isolation. Also, her simple clothes suggest her ""simple"" lifestyle and detachment from the hard lives others live. The boys in the gritty inner city school are recognizable in their over-sized coats and baggy pants. The girls wear ""bling"" and flashy pants. When another troublemaker of the story enters, her makeup and clothing is dark. The acting itself it realistic and not overdone. When students share their stories about their hardships, their expressions and sometimes tears seem genuine. Costumes are kept modern for realistic purposes. Props are used minimally in this story, which reinforces the focus on the lives of the kids, thus not distracting the viewer from the messages. It is the cinematic elements that make the movie unique. Opening with eye-level angles and close ups on Sara's face, one meets Sara as she goes through a transition from security to estrangement. Dark and wintery lighting give the effect of sadness, guilt, and apprehension. The movie opens with dark blues, greys, and whites. As flashbacks of happiness occur, one notices the transition from dark to bright clothes and brighter lighting. To show where a character stands in comparison to his or her environment, medium and long shots are used often. The camera moves in a long shot when the movie watcher meets Derek, the future lover and guide to Sara. This definitely makes him stand out and highlights his interest in intelligence in contrast to his classmates. Long shots are used when one meets most of the other characters, including Malakai, the antagonist of the story. Importantly, music is greatly and effectively used. The music plays when there is sadness. Piano solos and string symphony cue when Sara is reminiscing. The music undoubtedly carries the story. It emphasizes sadness, strength, moving forward, and guilt. One major chord can pull a heartstring and such riffs and pitches effectively enhance the emotion."

","This is my wife's favourite movie of all time. I watched it with trepidation, but to my surprise I enjoyed it and actually consider it to be a well-made movie. I should keep my comments about this movie, but I think it is worthy of note that this title has led to many copycat movies which all seem to have the same story... girl meets boy, girl and boy both have problems but overcome them through their love of dancing. You could view this genre very cynically for that reason, but I genuinely think that 'Save The Last Dance' was at least original at the time. The characters are real, the acting is solid and the music is well chosen. You can enjoy this film even if you don't enjoy hip-hop."

","*Save The Last SPOILER* <br/><br/>Young Sarah (Julia Stiles), who wanted above everything to enter into Julliard, decides to give up her dream after her mother dies in a car accident while coming to see her at a tryout.<br/><br/>She also has to leave the quiet little town she lived in and move to Chicago, to live with her father (Terry Kinney).<br/><br/>She ends up living with him in a 'not so good' part of town, where she is enrolled in a high school where most students (and teachers) are African-American.<br/><br/>She manages to make some friends, though, like the spunky Chenille (Kerry Washington), and even to find someone to love; Derek (Sean Patrick Thomas), Chenille's brother.<br/><br/>But as we all know, 'the course of true love (and to the Julliard) ne'er runs smooth'; the racist mentality of some (black) people, or the wannabe gangsta Malakai (Fredro Starr), are some of the obstacles this couple will have to face, in order to reach a well-deserved happy end...<br/><br/>Curiously, despite being a typical teen-romance movie, 'Save The Last Dance' manages to be entertaining, involving and sweet, without anyone risking to go into diabetic coma, or roll his eyes at blatant romanticism or dumb things done by the characters, whichever comes first, becoming therefore the exception to Teen Romance Movies Rule N°1 -Melodramatic crap.<br/><br/>Save The Last Dance: 7/10."
"xxitalianxx","Null","1","4","9 May 2006"," Save the Last Dance
","The movie Save the Last Dance, directed by Thomas Carter was a break through for black and white couples. This movie was about a white girl named Sara Johnson who fell for a black boy named Derek Reynolds. Sara originally lived in the Midwest until the death of her mother. She was then forced to move in with her father Roy who she really didn't consider to be her dad. <br/><br/>Being the only white girl in a black community she felt very out of place in school and not too safe walking around the streets at night. She met Chenille Reynolds who we eventually figure out is Derek's sister. Chenille welcomes her and makes her feel at home. She introduces Sara to some of her friends and everything seems to be going fine.<br/><br/>Even though she seemed to have made friends it doesn't mean people technically agree with her having feelings with a black boy. At first Derek and Sara didn't get along then they started to hang out and dance together. This is when she started to fall for him. One scene that sticks out in my mind was when Sara and Derek were on the train together and the old lady kept starring at them. She was disgusted to see an interracial couple. In her days it wasn't fine to see that, today in the 21st century it is more normal but still not to accepting. <br/><br/>Another scene that showed someone cared that they were together was at the club. One time was with Derek's ex-girlfriend Nikki. Derek and Sara were dancing and Nikki got jealous and told Sara off saying just because she is white she thinks can come and take what's hers hence Derek. <br/><br/>Despite what everyone else thought they were in love. They only cared about each other and those who didn't mind them being together. They were both splitting and going their different ways when they movie was over. Derek going off to medical school and Sara being accepted to Julliard, we will never know what ends up happening to them unless they make another movie. Whatever does happen though will work out for the best of them I feel."

","this was an excellent film.. the best hip hop film of all time definitely.. a feel good film which will have you totally glued to the screen from start to finish. Julia Stiles (10 things i hate about you)and Sean Patrick Thomas(Barbershop) worked so well in this movie creating great chemistry and doing the script great justice. I was pleasantly surprised by the actual script, the dance industry was portrayed in a realistic light and it showed racial issues which people are faced with still but also the streets and violience, choosing whether or not to make the right decision - binary opposition. Its one to watch on a great night in which will make you laugh and cry at the same time!!"

","I saw the movie, not once, not twice, but more than 6 times..! I love it..! <br/><br/>It's so natural. It's something everybody could happen..No, of course not to be so good in ballet, but to lose your mother. And I think everybody blames someone for that.. It's the way she deals with it that makes the movie beautiful, and of course the love between her and Derrek!!<br/><br/>I don't know how it is in America, how you accept love between a black and white person. But what I do know that here in the Neterlands it's not well accepted by everybody. I personally don't have any problems with it. It think this movie shows many people that love doesn't have a colour.. Maybe this movie helps, every help is welcome..<br/><br/>Greets Amarins"

","Sara Johnson gave up on her dream to become the Prima Ballerina. after her mother died, she moved to Chicago, to her father's place and tried to move on her life there. however, life was not easier as she expected it to be. she feels out of place as an only white girl in their school and her classmates are much tougher. followed by this smart, handsome black guy, Sara learns to hit more steps and learns what she's really born to be: a ballerina. Derek helps her move on and decided to give her talent another try and signed for an audition in Julliard...things are different when Derek and Sara are together....why don't you check the film out as i can't give you all details really....<br/><br/>actually, NEVER believe George Parker (the guy who wrote a comment on this film just above me) as he's a guy and he probably doesn't appreciate a good quality movie like Save the Last Dance. he might be right that this movie is most likely to be appreciated by teen females but hey! i will recommend it to anyone as it's a really good film. it gives us it's inner point that whoever you are or whatever you've gone through, you will always achieve what you've always wanted to achieve in life and it tells us to never give up our dreams just because someone in our life has gone because if you're born to be a dancer (for example), that's what you are going to be. you'll grow with it. it will always be you.<br/><br/>so, get a move on!"

","I've watched this film a thousand times, and each time it's more enjoyable.<br/><br/>The actors fit into the character roles excellently, and make the film 100% believable.<br/><br/>The choreography is excently put together. <br/><br/>The plot is fantastic, and a well written script makes this film exactly what it is - excellent.<br/><br/>For a Friday/Saturday night in, curling up on the sofa with a hotchoclate in one hand and a tub of ice cream in the other, this is definitely the movie for you."
"Oskado","10","1","4","4 September 2004"," A fine film, though mislabeled
","I personally liked this film and found the script intelligent. However, it is NOT a ""dance"" film. The two lead characters share several interests, the absolute least of which is dance - the foremost of which is survival, or coping to the environment. To me, it brought back memories of coping in the South Bronx, the south sixties in Chicago and in a warehouse district of Port of Spain - all places where I had wonderful experiences with unforgettable people but never without a degree of tension or apprehension. <br/><br/>On the other hand, I lived years in Brooklyn and saw absolutely zero within Saturday Night Fever that connected to my reality. I've never been able to stand Westside Story, for the glib way in which it eclipses hugely complex social issues behind a song-and-dance Romeo and Juliet story - and the way in which ""the enemy"" is wildly oversimplified, reduced to two, coherent gangs - when in fact muggers and killers appear anywhere - on the sidewalk ahead of you or in the next doorway or alley. In this film, I shared a sense of relief each time our lead characters arrived home alive. Yet the subject is not violence, nor shock - it's despite all I've said, an upbeat and humanistic film with a happy ending.<br/><br/>The ""Save the Last Dance"" title doubtless lured many who like the Dirty Dancing-SNF genre into watching, and I can understand their disappointment. This film is a vignette of life in a largely black neighborhood and of people who have both friendly and dangerous sides to them. There is a minimum of violence, virtually no offensive language, some great role models, no ""sex"" and is viewable by practically all ages."

","The first time i watched Save the last dance was when it was on TV last week, i heard that it was a good film so i decided to watch it and I'm glad i did as it was so good! I loved it so much that i decided to buy it on DVD and to get the soundtrack but as it had just been on TV it was sold out on DVD so i couldn't buy it anywhere until the other day! So finally i have brought the brilliant soundtrack which i'm listening to now and the amazing film on DVD + video which i have just watched! (again) I love the whole story lines and the characters especially Sean Patrick Thomas who is so FIT and he is the perfect man to play Derek! :) I loved the dancing, music, story and the characters in Save the last dance! Save the last dance is the type of movie i like, i also like Dirty Dancing + Coyote Ugly which i find are quite similar to Save the last dance! I am very glad that i finally watched this movie because it was really fun to watch and it has made me sing along to it and sometimes even dance! I would recommend this movie to anyone! Watch it, you will love it! J"

","I think that the film is excellent, showing what it is like for a white person in a black dominated area. The dancing is great, especially when they mix ballet with hip hop.<br/><br/>Julia Stiles does a brilliant job, so does Sean Patrick Thomas.<br/><br/>The way it shows what it is like for a black person a nd a white person to go out in a black dominated area is brilliant. It shoes that it is not just white people who are racist to blacks but the other way round to, when racist comments are said to Sarah (Julia Stiles character).<br/><br/>It show the bad side of life the shooting and the good side of life Derek trying ti get in to college and that not everyone is the same."

","I thought this was a great movie. It outlined a lot of troubles going on and how people are so prejudice. Maybe if people would open there eyes and see that this is one world with people and its not seperated anymore in two there wouldn't be as many crimes. This movie showed what goes on between black and whites and how other people need to just stay out of business that doesn't concern them. Save the Last Dance was just a great movie which gave insight on how people handle situations differently. After this movie was made my dad started looking at things different. I don't know if it helped much, but he isn't as bad now. Maybe other people have opened up more to and I'm glad that this could be a possible reason for that."
"wishful_goddess","6","1","5","14 July 2009"," A Guilty Pleasure
","Okay, okay, okay, I know. It's clichéd and predictable, the writing isn't fantastic (in fact, some of the lines are quite embarrassingly corny) and the acting barely squidges above adequate.<br/><br/>But...but...but...I friggin' love this movie. For a dance movie, I've seen a lot worse (Havana Nights, anybody?) and for plot-line, it's not the first of it's kind, but it certainly has an edge to it that keeps you interested, and certainly isn't a pitch lower than other, similar films (8 Mile).<br/><br/>The music is a stand out part, it's very, very good throughout, and many of the dancing scenes, particularly Sara's final audition and Derek giving her dancing lessons, are very entertaining and fun to watch. I especially love how believably jerky and unsteady Sara is on her feet during Derek's first lesson, and it really gave it some substance as I could totally imagine myself in that situation, feeling really ""dorky"" and unsure. It definitely gives the viewer the feeling that it's possible to cross racial ""red tape"" and attempt things they've never tried before.<br/><br/>I think, and I know some other reviewers disagree here, that the racial tension of putting a Caucasian girl into a situation where she is the subject of scorn from African-American individuals is refreshing and interesting to watch. While it's appreciated that Blacks have been oppressed and treated unfairly, it's nice to see a film that takes a look at it from another direction, in this day and age, in this culture and in this generation of students. I think it was also given with a grain of salt (I didn't forget that annoying yappy white girlfriend of Sara's who constantly wants to pray and can't comprehend that Sara might date an African-American.) <br/><br/>All in all, I recognise that it's not Citizen Kane or Trainspotting or anything, but it is a guilty little pleasure. It's a fun, relaxing and interesting storyline with characters that you can easily care about, stereotypical though they may be. It's not a perfect model, but if you just want to listen to some great music, watch some amazing choreography, and maybe tear up a little bit, this movie's got all the right moves."

Firstly, The black guy, Sean Patrick Thomas was not a criminal he just lived in a rough neighbourhood. He had ambitions to become a Paediatrician.
Secondly I believe people took dislike to this film because it was a black on white thing. Get over yourselves it's a movie. In this day and age people mix and that's a fact.

"zardoz-13","7","0","3","22 February 2008"," Good Performances in a feel-good movie with contrived situations
","""Save the Last Dance"" is a fish-out-of-water fable about 17-year old white bread wannabe ballet dancer Sara Johnson (Julia Stiles of ""The Bourne Ultimatum"") who loses her mom in a tragic car accident and finds her world turned upside down when she has to join her estranged father, jazz musician Roy Johnson (Terry Kinney of ""Oxygen""), in Chicago and attend a predominantly African-American high school.<br/><br/>The contrived but well-intentioned Duane Adler & Cheryl Edwards screenplay severely strains credibility because it propels an outsider into a predicament that nobody in their right mind would countenance, even Sara's loser father. Sara is literally the only Caucasian girl in the entire school, at least the only one that we can relate to in a meaningful way. Yes, several other white girls attend the school, but we catch only a glimpse of them during lunch. Sara has to move in with her father in his cramped, decrepit inner-city apartment because her mom died in an accident on the way to watch her daughter audition for the prestigious Julliard Dance Academy. Love starved Sara blames herself for her mother's death and renounces ballet until she becomes involved with a bright African-American high school student, Derek Reynolds (Sean Patrick Thomas of ""Dracula 2000""), that attracts her attention during her first day of classes when they argue about Truman Capote in their literature class. Eventually, Sara and Derek become an item, much to the chagrin of Derek's jealous ex-girlfriend Nikki (Bianca Lawson of ""Primary Colors"") and Derek's sister Chenille (Kerry Washington of ""Mr. & Mrs. Smith"") who resents Sara as a white girl intruding into places that she shouldn't be.<br/><br/>Chenille feels like Sara is a persona non grata taking advantage of her lily white skin to pull a black man out of his culture. Chenille and Sara have an on-and-off friendship and Chenille's problem with Sara grows out of her own lousy relationship with her boyfriend/out-of-wedlock father to her illegitimate child who refuses to take responsibility for his part in their own relationship. Meanwhile, Derek has problems with his own circle of friends, principally his supposed 'boy' Malakia (shaven headed Fredro Starr of ""Torque"") who once took the rap for him years earlier. This theme of one friend taking the fall for another in a crime is as old as the James Cagney & Pat O'Brien crime thriller ""Angels with Dirty Faces."" Later, when Derek realizes how much Sara means to him and how little Malakia does with his criminal shenanigans, Derek abandons Malakia and focuses entirely on Sara. Indeed, Derek nurtures Sara, teaches her the basics of hip-hop dancing, and becomes intimate enough with her that she shares her dream of being a ballerina.<br/><br/>At the same time that all of his drama is transpiring, Sara has to deal with her father; Roy realizes that he hasn't been a role model for her himself. Derek is unlike his other black friends because he aspires to get out of the ghetto and move on to bigger and better things, namely, he wants to attend Georgetown University and become a pediatrician.<br/><br/>""Save the Last Dance"" is a teen romance with a protagonist Sara who doesn't realize how different that she is from all her other friends in a largely black high school. She has a run-in with Nikki that lands them both in detention. She gets to experience first-hand the disadvantages that blacks contend with in the ghetto, especially when Chenille has to wait for hours at a clinic for an appointment with her son. During these scenes some semblance of racial tension and the problems that blacks deal with come out of the Adler & Edwards script. Thomas stages a couple of drive-by shootings and the African-Americans rant about respect and trade lead with other blacks. ""Save the Last Dance"" confines most of the racial tension to the background. Not surprisingly, there is a happy ending, but things as well as actors change in the straight-to-video sequel. Good performances by Stiles and Thomas bolster this above-average but clichéd opus."

"b015422","4","0","2","14 April 2006"," I miss it!
","Now, I am a huge fan of dance movies. However, this movie for some reason doesn't do it for me.<br/><br/>I'm not someone who's going to say that it sucks, but i'm going to explain why It doesn't work for me. <br/><br/>Overall, a dance movie doesn't need a huge storyline. There are exceptions of course. Still, It doesn't matter if it's predictable, as long as you can see what you came for: The Dancing! If I like the dancing, then I like the movie, simple as that. (Flashdance is a wonderful example). Here's where the movie already failed for me. I'm not saying that the dancing is bad, as a matter of It's quite good! Not that it's revolutionary or something, but it's good. Then what is wrong with it?<br/><br/>""There is not enough dancing"" <br/><br/>Really, Sarah (Julia Stiles) wants to become a professional ballet dancer. Now, I do ballet myself (I'm no pro thought) so it's really a sensitive something for me. If she loves it so much, then why the heck don't we ever get to see it? We only get these tiny glimpses of it. Now, don't get me wrong, what we see of it is good but we don't see enough of it. <br/><br/>Maybe this movie was supposed to be with very little ballet and they decided to make it complete with hip hop. Now, I have never ever done hip hop myself, so it's a lot less sensitive (and familiar) to me. But I even thought that there was still not enough of it. putting classic ballet in it would make a nice contrast with modern hip hop, it seems as if the movie makers thought that the world no longer likes ballet.<br/><br/>Now, what to do when there's not enough dancing: turn to the story which I thought was utterly ridiculous, very clichéd and extremely predictable. Instead of a nice dance sequences that will leave you dancing after wards we only get stupid dialog.<br/><br/>Maybe it had very deep characters like in Fame No, the characters where way too stereotyped: predictable from the beginning to the end. Even the good cast (yes, overall they're good) can't bring them out well.<br/><br/>What I especially miss, absolutely most of all (This is implied at all the latest dance movies, not just this one in particular) is the energy and the enthusiasm. What makes Footloose so good? The fact that it appeals trough great modern music enthusiastic actors and so on. Even the dark Flashdance had and I find it missing in today's dance movies which is a total shame.<br/><br/>Okay, I have been criticizing this movie all the time, just what exactly is good about this movie? The music is well done and fits everything well.The acting? I've stated it before: is overall quite well, nothing Oscar awarding but well done.<br/><br/>In the final end, I can't resist a dance movie. At some point I actually like it: But next time I watch it I will turn of the sound and read a book in the meantime. When i take a peak and see some dancing I""ll definitely watch."

My favorite scenes were Stepps and Sara and Derek kissing. Before I saw the movie, I hated hip hop, but now I don't mind it. On a scale of 1-10, I give this movie a 14. It was great that Sara didn't give up her dream just because her mom died in the car accident. She definitely broadened her horizons and became more sure of herself. I saw the movie on cable the first time. After I rented it and loved it, I bought it and can't stop watching it. I love TV shows and movies with interracial couples, especially ""Guess Who's Coming To Dinner"". Save The Last Dance is one of my favorite movies. I even loved Sean Patrick Thomas. I can't wait to rent his Barbershops movies. I also can't wait to rent Julia Stiles other movies."

","I could watch this movie over and over! The character development between the two main characters is brilliant and the racial prejudice that comes with it is shown clearly through out. You can feel the chemistry between them both and the way they connect through their different talents in music is excellent culminating in the beautiful dance at the end, which I think was also a metaphor for their relationship. Overall maybe the older generation may not appreciate this film and Julia Stiles has shown better acting skills than this however she does pull it off and it is still a remarkable film that brings me to tears every time!"
"philip_vanderveken","6","0","2","3 June 2005"," A typical teenage chick flick
","Sometimes, just by reading the title of the movie, you already know that you will not get an original or extraordinary movie to see. But then again, how many movies do fit that description? Not too many and that's why I gave this movie a try. I hoped that, even though it wouldn't be any special, it still would be worth giving a try...<br/><br/>The movie tells the story of Sara, a typical white young girl who dreams of becoming a ballerina and who is supported in that dream by her mother. But when her mother dies in a tragic car accident, her dream is suddenly over. She is convinced that she caused her mother's death because if she didn't have to do that audition, her mother wouldn't have been on that road at that moment. Because she has no-one to take care of her, she moves to her father in Chicago, which she doesn't know at all and who lives in the ghetto. Communication with him goes difficult and to make things worse she gets transferred to a new school where she is about the only white person. Still she is able to make some friends and she even finds a boy to fall in love with, but racism and jealousy are never far away. Despite all those difficulties, they'll fight to make something of their lives and together they will reach their goals...<br/><br/>As I already said and after reading such a resume you know it too: there can be no doubt that this will not be a very original movie. Still I wasn't prepared to see so many corny clichés in less than two hours time. From the first minute on, you already know exactly where this movie will go to, only to see later on that you were completely right. The director has opened a huge can with all the possible clichés and magic formulas Hollywood has to offer for movies in this genre and used about every possible one of them. White girl on ballet, mom dies, she doesn't know her dad or anyone where she moves to, she goes living in a tough neighborhood and falls in love with a black kid, a lot of racism and jealousy from all sides, they believe in each other and will make something of their lives... Is there any possible cliché that they haven't used? I don't think so.<br/><br/>Still, there was something positive to be noticed as well. The acting for instance wasn't bad. I'm not saying Julia Stiles did an excellent job, but it was OK. She reminded me a bit of Leelee Sobieski for who I guess this could have been a typical role. They are about the same age, look a bit the same and Sobieski plays the same kind of roles, so if the makers had switched them in the middle of the movie, I might not even have seen the difference. Whether that is a good thing or not, I leave up to you. The other actors like Sean Patrick Thomas, Kerry Washington, Fredro Starr... were all about the same: nothing exceptional, but not bad either.<br/><br/>If there is one scene that I'll remember and that certainly is worth mentioning than it must be the combination of the ballet audition with the drive-by shooting, almost at the end of the movie. The contrast between these two worlds, the combination of that classical music with that hard urban life show perhaps best what the makers wanted us to see: their love for each other saves them and makes sure they will make something of their lives. The rest of the scenes isn't spectacular, original or even worth mentioning.<br/><br/>All in all this is just a typical teenage chick flick. I'm sure they will love it, but I wasn't too happy about it. I'm not saying it was a complete waste of my time, but it had nothing to offer why I would ever want to see it again. I give it a 5.5/10."

","Save the last dance is a great combination of hot music and drama. It has a great cast both Julia stiles and Sean Patrick Thoma's do a great job as the leading roles.

This film is mainly about young people following their dreams and dealing with the heartache of falling in love when the odds are stacked against them. If you like coyote ugly, honey or dirty dancing this is the film for you. It also has a fantastic soundtrack well worth a listen if you are in to Hip hop! It may not be to everyones taste but i loved it."

","I saw this movie for the first time the other day. I thought it was pretty good after watching it for awhile. Julia Stiles is a good actress. I will look for more of her movies in the future. This love story was a kind of behind the scenes type of thing when the boyfriend gets accepted to Georgetown to get a degree and get away from the inner city. However, there's the girlfriend, played by Stiles that comes from the Midwest and gets in the inner city. So you have the ""opposites attract"" type of thing going on. I like that idea. I also liked the part where they get into each other's music and culture. We can learn a lot from each other if we really put our minds to it. I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone."

The first kiss between Derek and Sara was very tender and sweet and the ""love scene"" was left to your imagination.<br/><br/>Usually the guy makes the first move but in this scene Sara made the move when she told Derek that her father was at work and would not be home all night. Personally I wish the scene would have gone a little farther but it was in good taste. It had a variety of issues and a lot of good dancing. Sean and Julie made a cute couple and played the scenes well together. Sean is sooooo handsome."

Of course the script placed the actors in ""cliche'd"" story lines but there are few stories of any kind that don't.

","First of all I like to confess that I'm not a fan of hip-hop myself, I never was. When I sat to watch this movie in a TV channel I knew nothing of its premises, whether it had hiphop, or it is produced by Mtv etc. The local TV listing pointed it out as a 'drama' and that's all. But in the end, somehow the movie got me like itself. Not only for its mild simplicity in story, direction, acting and screenplay, but also for its use of hip-hop. The main theme of the story is a clichÃ©, indeed. But the presentation is unique. Anti-racism is the movie's main theme, so is fusion in classical and popular music as well. This movie has romance, tension, sad moments, serious sequences... and amusingly to offer a surprise relief in all these seriousness, there comes hip-hop.<br/><br/>Julia Stiles acted quite well, though I don't know if she used a stunt double during the shots of ballet dancing, because they were not good. Other than that, even during hip-hop dance scenes, she was good to watch. Sean Patrick Thomas, whose career I did not follow was very interesting. I got surprised to find out later that he was 31 when this movie is shot. He looked so original indeed. Rest of the cast offered a decent performance as well.<br/><br/>In the end, I liked the show. It is better for Mtv to produce such movies more, since we tend to hail pop culture very easily. To blend that with such serious theme is still quite unique. 7/10"

Dangers of an inner-city schools are acknowledged, not cheesily dramatized. The interracial relationship between Sara and Derek is met with tension, instead of the usual ""minorities must conform to the whites!"" crap that Hollywood consistently pulls. The couple is continually forced to face with the very real problems of two different ethnic backgrounds being together.<br/><br/>This movie is far more intelligent than most high school-based settings, yet at the same time, it's definitely a feel-good movie, the type you watch when you simply want to have a good time and know you'll be in a good mood when the movie ends. Sara's interaction with Derek during their dance practices are amusing, the music is beautiful and has a good beat (ESPECIALLY Sara's second audition piece, I think it's the theme to StLD)and the dancing is pleasing to the eye.

To do this, she must move from her middle class white world to urban Chicago, where her blond hair and ballet training do little to help her blend in with her new peers.<br/><br/>But Sara is no wallflower, and finds a place for herself in her new school and community. Here, too, dance plays an important part of life, and in learning how to ""speak"" the physical language of hip hop dance, Sara is befriended by Derek Reynolds (Sean Patrick Thomas). Despite the pressures from their peers, Sara and Derek find themselves drawn to each other, and help each other grow.<br/><br/>While I feel that this movie glosses over many of the problems Sara would have faced in her situation, it's a passable teen romance, and tries to have a message. How successful this message will be at reaching its target audience is dubious, but the movie will probably be enjoyed for its music and dance sequences, and for its humor."

"Apostle","8","0","2","16 February 2001"," Finally, an MTV movie worth watching!
","After a few years of really, REALLY bad movie making, MTV finally strikes gold with this movie. Look for Sean Patrick Thomas to star in many more motion pictures, as he really holds his own here. Derek, played by Sean Patrick, is basically the glue that holds the relationships together, all while fighting his own demons of self doubt. The character of Sara, played by Julia Stiles, plays her part the way it should be played. Shy at first, because she gets ripped from the only home she ever really knew and then thrust into an inner city Chicago high school as one of possibly three other white kids which you never see. But she also defends herself verbally with anyone that gives her any static. <br/><br/>At first I was a little disappointed with all the racial stereotypes. Inner city Chicago school loaded with black students, so obviously there has to be security at the door. Plenty of hip-hop and smack running in the cafeteria and, of course, the air of drugs, weapons, and drive bys. However, as the film progressed, I started to wonder if that isn't what really drives the movie forward. In one of the sub-plots,  Derek tries to get his best friend Maliki out of the gang scene that seems to be holding him back. Without the inner city stereotypes, it would be a pointless for Derek to try and change Maliki. <br/><br/>What makes this movie as good as it was is the fact that you wanted to like everyone in the movie, and you hope that everything will turn out alright for everyone in it at the end. (With the possible exception of Nikki, who spends the entire movie trying to split up Derek and Sara.) The part of Sara's father was well written and performed. He spent what little movie time he had trying to be the father he knew he should have been, and is less concerned about Sara and Derek than most. <br/><br/>All in all, this movie was very well written and performed. Look for Stiles and Thomas to go far in their acting career. If they are as good with big name stars as they are with each other, I'm sure that we'll see alot more of both of them.<br/><br/>Grade: A-"

However, I ended up seeing this with a friend because it was the last movie playing and we really didn't want to go home.  It was actually fairly decent.  I'm not saying it was great or even good, but it sneaked in as passable.  The acting is fairly decent and the script treated some issues that normally would be glossed over with respect.

Yes the movie was romantic but even stupid people can tell that from the previews. So if you don't like romantic movies then don't see it and shut up.

"ravenlll","8","0","1","3 February 2001"," EXCELLENT and MEANINGFUL MOVIE
","I really enjoyed this film.  Sean Patrick Thomas and Julia Stiles were wonderful in this movie which combined dancing, the reality of interracial relationships, and following your dreams.<br/><br/>I felt the depiction of Sara moving to inner city Chicago was fairly real. She attends a high school wherein she is only one of about 10 white students.  She is open-minded enough to want to make friends and finds herself being taken under Chenille's wing.  She find out that Derek, a boy she has already exchanged verbal sparring with, is Chenille's brother.<br/><br/>Sara and Derek find that they have some things in common, mostly that they have dreams that they aren't sure they can achieve.  Through their friendship, they ultimately learn that you can do, or be, whatever you want if you just put your mind to it and work hard.  Sara and Derek are color-blind and fall in love based upon a deep respect and admiration for one another.<br/><br/>However, all is not roses.  They face negativity from most of Derek's family and friends.  They don't understand how Derek can be with a ""white"" woman, and accuse Sara of ""stealing"" one of the few *good* black men left.  They have to make a decision.  Are they in it together?  Are they strong enough to work towards their goals and be in a relationship?  Can they get past that everyone else thinks they should not be together?<br/><br/>
This movie contains phat dance scenes, a phat soundtrack, laughs, tears (I cried three times), some positive moral decisions (as well as a few negative), and most of all hope.<br/><br/>I would recommend this movie to anyone over the age of 16."
"jchan","10","0","1","3 February 2001"," Great chemistry, entertainment, and emotion!
","I thought Save the Last Dance was wonderful.  I never cry at movies, but this one made me cry 3 times.  The chemistry between Julia Stiles (played Sara) and Sean Patrick Thomas (played Derek) was incredible and absolutely believable.  You could FEEL the attraction between them, and they draw you into the story.  There were scenes where you could just see that not only were they playing the emotional and physical role but the intelligence and thought of the role as well.  I've also been a big fan of choreographer Fatima, and she does a great job in all those dramatic, fun, and complex dance scenes. Others who commented that sending a ""white girl"" into a Chicago high school to become ""black"" in two days was unrealistic missed the entire focus of the movie.  First of all, Sara didn't become ""black.""  The whole emphasis was that she was white and others had problems with the interracial couple. It was completely realistic because some people in our society still can't get past two people of different races dating.  Another aspect that was very realistic was the fact that the students in this high school dominated by African-Americans didn't drop and gasp because of ""the new white girl invading their territory.""  It showed that they had better things to deal with. I enjoyed the whole experience this movie brought forth.  I rated it a 10 out of 10 because not only did it entertain and bring out emotions in me, but it was realistic and tackled a problem that is still prominent in society today."

","At first when one of my friends said that they wanted to go to see ""Save the Last Dance"", I thought that it would be another one of those stupid romantic dramas with no point to it. However, there was something different about this one. Oh it was another romantic drama and you can argue about whether there is a point to it or not, but based only on entertainment quality, this movie is a winner. There are many good qualities about this movie so basically everyone who buys a ticket is going to enjoy it. If you are into romance they have that covered and thensome, if you are into hip hop music/dancing this movie is full of it, if you are into action you will love the gang scenes, and if you are just looking for a good 100 minutes, you will also love it.<br/><br/>The basic plot is this, Sarah, an aspiring ballet dancer from the suburbs played by Julia Stiles (10 things I hate about you), must move in with her dead beat father in the inner city of Chicago after a family tragedy. There she is thrown into an entirely different culture where she eventually meets Derek, the romantic interest played by Sean Patrick Thomas (cruel intentions). He teaches her to dance hip-hop, they hook up, feel the heat from their friends due to the race factor, and I won't tell the end. That may sound corny but for some reason it is extremely entertaining.Anyway, if you are looking for a good, not deep movie, see ""Save the Last Dance"". ********* (9 of 10 stars)"

","I confess, I was wary of this movie. After 'Down to You', (which I absolutely hated!!), I didn't want to go see another Julia Stiles movie. But the great acting from Stiles in '10 things I hate about you' convinced me to give her another chance. I am so glad I did so.<br/><br/>A friend of mine told me that this movie was more about race than dancing, so I was prepared for that. And boy, was he right! I loved the growing relationship between Sarah and Derek. I thought they played each scene perfectly with the exception of the break-up scene. I think she showed perfect emotion when going over her past with Derek.<br/><br/>Who wouldn't fall for him by the way. He does right, (for the most part), he's sweet, kind, and accepts change well. He was smart, and loyal. The scene in which Derek tries to convince Malachi to do the right thing was great! Way to go, Derek!<br/><br/>I was uncomfortable with the language, and can't even imagine that anyone would take their young children to this film. The fact that they took premarital sex as a given, and that they drank as if it was 'the thing to do' even though they were all underage for such things was disconcerting to me. That may make me a prude or square or throwback or whatever, but these things should NOT be commonplace, and should NOT be taken for granted.<br/><br/>All in all, a great flick for 16 and older!"

Going back and forth between three different scenes that occurred at three different times was a very good choice from the director's part. Very artistic and it set the tone of the movie nicely.  The social issues dealt with in the movie were not treated with careless hollywood perspective.  It could have been deeper, but for the purpose of the target audience, it was dealt with care and respect.  It is not your typical Teen movie, and I truly enjoyed it.

","I'm a 48 year old woman who enjoyed watching Save The Last Dance because I thought it portrayed a beautiful relationship between the lead characters. It showed them struggling with maintaining a focus on future goals while living in the ghetto and to the extent that they were successful in doing this, I think the movie shows it is possible to strive for the stars and believe in yourself, even if it seems unlikely your dreams will come true. I think the movie also showed the difficulties in trying to have a relationship that is interracial. The characters grow to love each other, and once they fall in love, the differences in their race no longer matter to them, but, as in the real world, those differences still matter to those around them and they have to come to terms with that fact in order to move on. I think the movie also realistically portrayed ghetto life, in terms of the pressure to belong to a gang and get involved in criminal activity. I also liked the depiction of the relationship between Sara and her father, which starts out being nil and slowly starts to grow."

I would see this movie over and over again! Teens can appreciate it because it incorporates everything we love i.e. clubs, music, dancing, and relationships. Older people may have a problem getting into a movie that is not aimed at their demographic and you shouldn't slam a movie just because you are too old to get into it. So my advice for those over 30 would be for you to wait for John Travolta to do a movie on inter-racial relationships and I am sure you'd like it!"

Facts presented:  if you screw around, you may get pregnant and the guy isn't likely to stay around....if you fool with drugs you will end up in jail or dead....if you do well in school (even in a ghetto school) there is a future in college....black/white matters to some, but it shouldn't.....

","The two leads are adorable.  They look like real people.  (As opposed to Jennifer Beals and Michael Nouri in ""Flashdance.""   Do people who look like that really weld?)  At times, I'd think of ""Billy Elliot"" when Stiles was going through her ""awkward"" dance phase.  (This isn't a bad thing.)  The ""thug-friend"" subplot was unnecessary and detracted from the dance, coming-of-age stuff.  And where was all the hip-hop music?  ""Romeo is Dead"" seemed to have more.  It's better than ""Flashdance"" but, because it has regular people in the leads, it's not nearly as sexy.  No scene that comes close to Beal taking off her bra from under her sweat top.  Still it's a great film for its audience (which, scary enough, were toddlers when ""Flashdance"" hit) and a pretty okay film for the rest of us."

The dance sequences also do very little to save the film.  They are few and far between. And as dance sequences go, they are lacking in intensity and aren't all that much to look at.  Despite all this, it wasn't hard to sit back and enjoy the movie for what it had to offer.   It is an entertaining formula afterall."

","I really enjoyed this movie. The trailer was misleading, I thought it was going to be another Centre Stage (which was a cute movie) but it had a lot more substance than that. Julia Stiles played the role of Sarah really well, she brought a lot of emotion to it and you could see the vacant looks when she thought of her mom, and the looks of pain when she talked about her. Sean Patrick Thomas pulled off his role well too as he seemed a diverse character, able to be the promising med student to be and a street-wise semi-thug at the same time. He balanced the two very well. The comedy added to the movie and tackled some very prominent issues for us nowadays, interracial dating and the death of a loved one as well as peer pressure and teen moms. I thought the depiction was excellent and can hardly wait to get it on DVD."

","i entered this film very skeptical. being a teenage boy, the previews for this film portrayed it as your classic chick flick with a lot of airheaded twenty-year olds playing adolescent kids. i was presently suprised to see that this film was more than that. the scripting, the dancing, and the movie was all done very well and way beyond normal mtv standards (i try to forget movies like ""bevis and butthead do america"" or ""the wood"" even exist). Sean Patrick Thomas was great in the male lead, very calm and cool, i think we will see him again soon. although this film was suprisingly good, it still managed to throw african-americans into a stereotypical environment. unless you are a genius heading for georgetown, your only hopes are to be a drugdealer, and gangbanger, or an unwed mother going nowhere. i felt that it still portrayed the black society as one that in uneducated and unwanted.<br/><br/>all in all, i did end up enjoying this film and it is a great date movie, but the stereotypes behind the dancing are still difficult to see past."

","When I went to go see Save the Last Dance it's opening night, I was skeptic about the plot of this film.  White girl goes to urban city  where she is a minority in the school that is mostly black, she meets a guy whom teaches her the fundamentals of hip hop dancing and they fall heads over heel over each other while many on-lookers disapprove the interracial aspect of their relationship.  This film could have easily fallen into the many cliche's found in high school aged drama's being  made today - but it doesn't, it's smarter! To me the character's depicted here are much more developed then in other teen romances (ex: She's all that, Here on Earth) The story probes deeper into the lives of the individual characters.  The film is sold as a romance flick, which it is, but it also presents the diffrent lives of each of the players - all of whom we come to care about.  Julia Stiles shines in her role as Sarah, I first saw her in the teen flick ""Ten Thing's I Hate About you""  and eversince then she has become a rising star.  Don't be suprise if in a couple of years when she finds the right script she'll be standing on the stage of Shrine Auditorium making her Oscar acceptance speech. Sean Patrick Thomas is dashing and charming as  Dereck, by the end of the film we all wish that he was our boyfriend.  On top of that the dancing was the icing on top of the cake for me.  Sure there wasn't as many dance numbers as there was in ""Center Stage"" but we get to see Sarah and Dereck court each other while sharing there common love of dance - not to mention those scenes are very funny. The film sort of reminds me of that classic ""Dirty Dancing"" only I like Save the Last Dance WAY better then it. Some may disagree, but I figure I'm 16 this film is My generation, I know the songs, I know the dance - I can relate better. All in all see this film because it is not the usual teen romance flick, it is a clever story filled with a great actors.  *If you need more proof STLD is the number 1 movie for this weekend! Bumping cast away to number 2!  Word of mouth for this movie is great, it already made 24 mill exceeding it's cost of 13 mill!*"

","Yea, it is 2001 - no HAL or flying cars, but a really cool (sorry, slammin) film.  Yes - it was the only guy with tattoos in this upposed teen heart strings jerker, and dammit it was modern, mature, real, and also a fun time. ""I would never put a cap in your ass."" has never sounded so romatic (this is not being sarcastic).  This story of interracial love is funny for the fact that the problem the two lovers have is being too color blind while the whole world is not.  I remember a date way back on 92 with a slammin A. Cain - and someone yelled at us.  There are not a lot of punches pulled - but headlong head butts to the topic of inter racial love.  The point of white women stealing the good black men - ? one world or two very different worlds ? - does being yourself also include your color.  The audience I saw it with - 99% white (including my off color self) - was looking at everything big and small.  This movie hits strings you wouldn't notice unless you see it with an audience (this a must see in a theatre). In 2001, we are not anywhere near Jupiter - but much closer to home worlds are colliding nicely."

"Jack the Ripper1888","Null","0","2","19 April 2002"," Touching, sad and unexpectedly violent.
","This movie was a very good one. Julia Stiles delivers another outstanding performance as Sara, a girl who is sent to live with her father on the South Side of Chicago, where she is forced to give up the one thing that makes her happy: dancing. Until she meets Derek (Sean Patrick Thomas) who helps her in life and dance. Sara must struggle to form and keep a relationship with Derek before outside forces and racism break them apart. So, like I said, this movie was good. In fact, great. One hell of a movie this is.*SPOILERS* There was a lot of violence that I wasn't expecting to see in a Drama Romance movie. It shows basically how a black man lives and what their lives are like. How they think and how they act. Fredro Starr was a real bad@$$. He shows how a real mean thug actually acts. They act all cool and nasty and walk around with their big poofy jackets and use slang language all the time (I ain't saying that's bad, I do it all the time and I'm a white person). The rap in this movie was good too. I love rap. The ending was the best part of the movie, showing us what is happening to all of the film's central characters at one time. I thought that maybe Terry Kinney could have been a little better. But maybe not. He did a good job as being the father who didn't know how to please his daughter until the one time he does. There really isn't much else to say about this movie, except that it was great. Touching at some times and a little bad (mean bad, not terrible bad) at some times. If you're a woman and are easily touched by parts of a movie, then watch this because you will most likely cry. SAVE THE LAST DANCE: 5/5."

","I was expecting more of a dance movie; a updated version of Flashdance.  I'm glad I didn't get a modern Flashdance.  In a way I was a little disappointed at the lack of dance. While the movie revolved around it, you get very little full, put together dance scene. But I love Sarah's dance at the end. Very modern, very edgy.  Julia Stiles did a wonderful job with a very hard role physically.  Which leads me to ask if she ever was a real dancer?  The one thing that I was very happy to see was an interracial couple.  It's sad to say that in this day and age that's brave; but it is and the film makers do a wonderful job with it.  Having grown up in the suburbs of the greatest city in the world, Chicago (yes, I'm playing favorites) but having family in the inner city ghetto's, the Chicago portrayed is a very accurate picture.  Which is sad.  But it's still the greatest place in the world. Overall, I enjoyed this movie for what it was, a fun movie.  If I get a chance to see it again I will and will defiantly be going dancing after.  :-)"

","I did not expect to enjoy the film as much as I did, being classified as a romance/dance film. However the underplayed romance and minimal dance left alot of room for the drama of the characters to evolve.  A confronting tearjerker which I felt did not slip into too many cliches, and seemed more real to me than alot of Hollywood ""teen"" movies.  I liked the fact that it was set in a gritty neighbourhood in Chicago, people were poor, had problems and were trying to cope, but these issues were not overdramatised.  It was a nice change from the white middle-class affluence portrayed in most Hollywood films.  This film has SOUL."
"cellist","Null","0","2","30 March 2002"," Save the Last Dance - not just about race...
","Okay - the husband is out of town, so I get to rent chick flicks for the next couple of weeks.  I enjoy dancing - so this seemed like a natural.  I must say that I liked it, but not because it made a ""social statement"" about interracial relations.  Most of the reviews on this page seem to highlight the lack of character development, the cardboard stereotyping, and the lackluster romance between the two leads.  THIS IS BECAUSE THE MOVIE IS REALLY ABOUT THE FEMALE LEAD.  It is about what it takes to be a performer. As a professional cellist, I was pleased that this examination of why people succeed was handled with such care.  The male lead was just there to be the ""angel"" on the girl's shoulder.  There was not a future for them, if he was going to Georgetown and she to Julliard.<br/><br/>The guy had already succeeded in fighting his own fight for acceptance, and was admitted to a great college.  This movie was about him showing the girl that you have to quit feeling sorry for yourself and get out and take control of your own destiny!  That is what performing is all about!  The best scene, and the one that was most true to life, was when the two of them attend the ballet.  The thing that you want to do for the rest of your life SHOULD make you feel like the girl did as she watched the dancers on stage. I was even pleased to see that beautiful modern ""pas de deux"" at the end of the Joffrey show, because it made a statement by showing dancing that was just as close (and clothing that is more revealing) but socially acceptable.<br/><br/>All of the dialogue relating to this central theme was intense, well thought out, and it is obvious that it really came from the heart of the author who penned it.  I think that the true measure of this movie is that you could make the same movie using a white guy, instead of the black male lead, and the central theme would be EXACTLY the same, - the movie would still exist.<br/><br/>The rest of the movie (the romance, the dancing scenes, the gang stereotyping, the ""evil"" girl) is JUST goofy window dressing.  Of course, I would have preferred that the writer be allowed to explore this theme more, and that the subplots not be corny or overdone, but, hey, what are you going to do?  Enjoy this movie - I give it 6/10 stars."
"Aeris4ever","Null","0","2","28 February 2002"," A bundle of issues, wrapped nicely for teens
","I finally broke down and saw this movie the other night and was surprised at how much I disliked it.  First off, I'm past my teens, but I did dance for a long time growing up, so this film looked interesting.  But if you're looking for a dance film, the abysmal ""Center Stage"" is a better choice. What you'll get with ""Save The Last Dance"" is an over-dramatized lesson on urban city life.  Every issue you can imagine is thrown into this movie, but none of them are focused on nearly enough, making them worthless in the end. Yeah, we learn that Nikki is upset at Sara for stealing all the good black men.  And we learn about teenage motherhood.  But none of them are developed enough.  Why is Nikki all happy at the end while watching Sara dance?  Did I miss something?  <br/><br/>Sean Patrick Thomas was very good, I'll admit, but his character was too sweet to be real.  Julia Stiles is a bit too strong of a personality here. Sara is a strange character, I can't explain why.  Chenille was cute, but the actress looked 10 years too old for the role.  The minor characters were walking stereotypes, especially Malakai.  I'd give the best actor award to the guy who played Sara's father.  He was the most real of all the characters.<br/><br/>The dancing sequences weren't captivating at all.  The camera angles change constantly to hype the audience, but they just annoyed me.  Obviously, Julia had a pointe-double, and I couldn't stand the camera switching between the two.  It really killed any intensity that Julia's final dance might have had.  I wouldn't really call this a ""dance movie"".  It's more of an urban movie disguised as a dance movie to lure in middle-class, white, teenaged girls.  Too bad the movie shows black, city life in such a negative way."

As a black women, I'm glad some of the issues were addressed.  It is a fact that some black women have a problem with interracial dating (black men/white women).

"hmarcy","8","0","2","30 October 2001"," A very watchable `feel good' movie with an old plot
","There is no chance of giving the plot away on this one.  This has been done in `Flashdance', `Ballroom' and more than 50 movies going back to `A star is Born' and `Babes on Broadway' but this version has enough going for it that the predictability of the main plot becomes less unimportant when the entire movie is taken in as a whole.  <br/><br/>I found this movie very watchable due to the various sub-plots and character development that give this movie a very rich texture that allows you to overlook the numerous flaws.  The major change in this movie, from those mentioned above, is the interracial love affair that develops around the training of the novice (played stiffly by Julia Stiles) to become a talented dancer.  The sub-plots about peer pressure of a black man (played very well by Sean Patrick Thomas) going with a while girl, the acceptance of the family taken from the black point-of-view and the rivalry of an old girl friend (the very attractive Bianca Lawson) all add to this texture.  The most interesting character development was the relationship with the lead character's best friend (played very well by Fredro Starr).  A choice has to be made between supporting his old way of life as part of the neighborhood crew with measuring a friend by how he stands by you on the street and the future he has by being a good student with an opportunity to become a doctor.  This was, I thought, done very well with care and sensitivity to the characters involved.<br/><br/>This sensitivity carried over into other sub plots but as a whole the move was done with an atmosphere to be politically correct in the depiction of the school and life in the Ghetto in Chicago.  I'm sure this was softened to take in a wider audience but it was handled well and didn't detract from the movie.  This a good `feel good' movie to watch some night with your `significant other' over soda pop and a slice of pizza."

It has an urban setting, and the consequences of not ""getting with the program and dancing all night long"" are more deadly, but it fits right in, nonetheless.<br/><br/>And of movies of that genre, it's pretty darn good.

Not only did I like it, but three of my friends that have seen it really enjoyed it too.  I give this movie a 10!!"
"BHorrorWriter","Null","0","2","5 September 2001"," Touching
","To say that this movie breaks down the barriers that Racism has built over the last, 4-500 years would be a lie.  To say this was a very touching, poignant movie that really only skimmed the surface of bi-racial couples, would be true.<br/><br/>I was very impressed with this movie.  The acting was excellent, with the exception of a few characters.  The scenes were beautiful, and the dancing was superb.  Julia Stiles delivers and excellent performance as a white girl thrown into the more ""ghetto"" parts of chicago.  Being maybe 1 of 5 white kids in her new school, she attempts to befriends and black girl that gave her a little help her first day.  They become friends, and the story develops from there.<br/><br/>From finding herself again, to find love with a young black man, Derek (Shawn patrick thomas), and rediscovering her talent of ballet.  Sara, (stiles) becomes a regular in the middle of the mess surrounding the seedy parts of chicago.  Conflict with gangsta's, a fight with Derek's ex, are all building blocks leading to a wonderful conclusion, which I felt was much better than what my wife has predicted.  She was expecting Derek to go with Malikai, and something bad would happen.  I was hoping he didn't, and i was relieved to see the way the movie ended.<br/><br/>I normally don't root for characters like this in movies.  I am more a horror genre vet, but i was very pleased with this film, and would like to see more like it.<br/><br/>Racism is a disease that is destroying all races.  Not just black and white. Until we realize that we are all on this planet: one planet, as one race...we will forever fight each other.  We, black, white, hispanic, etc have to stand up to the adversity that we face.  I am white, and i am disgusted to know what kind of past we (white people) used to live.  I am from the south, and I am sure my ancestors were racist, or kept slaves (my grandfather is a huge bigot).  I dissassociate myself from that negativity.<br/><br/>Color should only be seen in ART, not life.  Fight to end Racism!<br/><br/>9 out of 10"

"TxMike","Null","0","3","8 August 2001"," Very nice study of modern inner-city race relations.
","SPOILERS - ""Save The Last Dance"" is about race relations. Older movies often explored this in the form of a black male (To Sir With Love, etc) into a predominantly white setting. This film does the opposite, transporting a very white and blonde female high school senior from the East into an almost all-black Chicago inner-city school. Although Sara (Julia Stiles) is not at all intimidated by the new setting, she is definitely a fish out of water, needing to learn a new language of slang, a new way of dressing, a new way of hip-hop dancing, and learning to deal with jealousy as she befriends Derek (Sean Patrick Thomas), the good-looking and college-bound black senior. As Sara finds out, in the black culture such upstanding young men are highly prized and young black women resent their being lured away for the pool by young white women.<br/><br/>The director of ""Save The Last Dance"" is a black man, Thomas Carter, who over the years has directed a few other movies, but a larger number of high-profile TV series. Among his goals for this film was to make it as true to current life as possible, and in viewing it I believe he has achieved this. A distraction was the obvious age discrepancies of some of the actors. For example, high school senior ""Derek"" was played by a 30-year-old actor, and several of the other high-schoolers appeared between 25 and 30.<br/><br/>
As the story starts, Sara is living with her mother, studying ballet, and auditioning for Juliard. She earlier pleaded with busy mom to be there for support.  Mom was not there, Sara botches her modern dance routine, later finds out that mom died in a car wreck while trying to make it to the try-out. Distraught, Sara blames herself and her dance interest, and vows to give up ballet. Moving to Chicago to live with her estranged dad, a local jazz trumpeter, attends the local public school.  Among the friends she makes is Derek, who teaches her to dance hip-hop, encourages her to take up ballet again, and the two develop a teen love relationship.<br/><br/>In the end, Sara gets another chance with a Juliard audition in Chicago, and finds she will be accepted. Derek yearns to be a doctor, a pediatrician, also finds he is accepted at Georgetown. Derek's friend, Malakai, shrugs off good advice, gets in trouble again, is carted off by the cops. Derek's high school sister has a young child, about 2 yrs, and battles with the father over his obligations. Thus this film touches on a number of real issues in modern teen life. <br/><br/>The DVD has a number of very interesting extra features, including comments by the director and several of the actors, plus a few deleted scenes which fill in a couple of ""holes"" in the script. Overall a very worthwhile film that faces the difficult issues of black/white race relations head on, but in a positive way."

","the movie ""save the last dance"" was a terrific movie but a little underacted. the  whole movie put together was great but julia stiles performance as a bad-ass,wasnt too believable. when she said she would be dancing circles around him,she didnt sound too realistic. i thought this movie was great,the only disappointment was that the two didn't end up together,he goes to georgetown and she goes to julliard. it leaves to the imagination of,did they get back together after school or did they part as friends. all in all,i though this was a good movie with a killer music and and an eye opening look at racism. it also shows the relationships of a divorced father and his daughter and her leaving everything she ever knew to live with a stranger.i thought the portrayal of this unsure father and scared and confused daughter was fabulous. all together i recommend this movie! either with your friends or with your boyfriend,you will have to rent this movie!"

I really like Stiles, but this romantic drama needs more than the manic scenes at the dance club. Drive-by shootings are shown as a matter of fact and nothing out of the ordinary. Sean Patrick Thomas is interesting. Kerry Washington and Bianca Lawson are very easy on the eye. If you are not into hip-hop, you will not enjoy this film much.

We often see stories just like this devolve into cliches, but Save the Last Dance manages to mesh them into lives of people that we can see in our own lives.<br/><br/>The acting was on par with many of my all time favorites, not because the actors were huge names, but because the characters came off the screen as real and not one-sided.<br/><br/>Give this movie a chance."

Yeah, there are cliches, but the best thing about this film is how uplifting it is.  It's about dreams and love and loss and finding the way through to lift yourself up to that place.  Julia Stiles (who I can't stand) was actually good in this film.  Mekhi was great (as per usual) and the rest of the cast were all good too.<br/><br/>But... it's the dancing.  The dancing is what makes it special.  No, it's not like watching the Turning Point or White Nights, but it reminds one how both music and dancing are the common language of the world and when you watch this movie, the dancing to the music lifts your soul a little higher.<br/><br/>A fun movie - definitely not The Hours, but great for it's genre."

","Although as a 30 year old male I am clearly not the target audience for this chick flick, it did have a couple of redeeming qualities.  While the plot held very little of interest, it was great to see a film which looked like it had been planned in advance rather than shot spontaneously.  The dialogue may have been mostly cliched and the acting robotic, but pronunciation was good.  Some critics have already pointed out that the dancing was lack-lustre, but at least noone fell over.<br/><br/>Overall, the film makers did manage to get the basics of this film down, and I think there may be some potential for crew who were not directly involved with the weak directing, lousy acting, poor script-writing and disappointing choreography.  Lighting and costuming, for example, were totally adequate."

It gave me some things to think about because I dance ballet and hip-hop and happen to know a dancers life can be tough.

","I saw the trailer for this film and thought oh, great another American teen guilt ridden angst film, but I believe in giving every film a chance and i have to say, I'm glad I did with this one.  At the start Julia Stiles is the stereotypical teenager in the way that she requires everyone to be at her beck and call.  Slowly throughout the film we see her beginning to develop as a character and learn several important life lessons.<br/><br/>But the thing that shocked me most about this film was that it wasn't really about dance.  This is the story about a young white girl trying to come to terms with the loss of her mother.  While coping with being at a new school that is predominately black and trying to rebuild a relationship with her father who was missing from most of her life.  To make things harder on her she falls in love with a gorgeous black student, who just happens to be one of the smartest kids in the school. The path of true love doesn't always run smoothly though and she finds herself isolated for not ""sticking to her own kind"".<br/><br/>I really have to praise the entire cast of this film they handle some very delicate issues on race relations very well and showed the audience that you can achieve anything if you want it badly enough."

If it had remained as such I would have happily sent it to the bottom end of my list with Bicentennial Man and Days Of Thunder. Luckily for it, me, and the group of friends that had dragged me along, it did actually pick up. While not actually doing anything new, Save The Last Dance comes across quite well. The characters are relatively believable, while the two leads suit each other. The dance scenes are well choreographed. OK, so it is a bit slushy throughout, but Save The Last Dance is the kind of film you'd get out if you wanted a nice, untaxing chick-flick."
"richjedi","Null","0","2","19 April 2001"," A compromise between previous comments
","Having seen the movie, one of the first things I wanted to do when I got to work the morning after was to comment here how much I enjoyed it. But first, of course, I read everyone else's comments.<br/><br/>As far as I can see, most everyone has got it half right.<br/><br/>The dance scenes are beautiful, and according to interview, Stiles did them all except for the pointe sections.<br/><br/>The soundtrack is mainstream.  There's a couple of wicked tracks on there, but - no - it's not dead original and there's nothing we haven't heard before.<br/><br/>The acting is standard.  The characters are stereotypes, and both the leads obviously knew this far enough in advance to fax their acting in, and make plans to do something better with the day.  I don't know who accused Stiles of being over-emotional, but I for one thought that her emotional outpour after watching the ballet was poorly acted.  Thomas was fortunate enough to go the entire film without having to act a scene beyond your stereotypical Intelligent, Forward-Thinking, Get-out-of-the-Ghetto Black Teen, and so had no such opportunity to display poor acting.<br/><br/>The plot is standard.  It doesn't reveal any depth, it doesn't address race issues in any new ways - but why should it? The film is selling itself as a teen dance movie; the message of tolerance is a bonus that unfortunately still needs to be communicated to millions, so we shouldn't criticise the film for putting it in, even as an afterthought.<br/><br/>This film is _not_ the best movie I've ever seen, and I only hope that people who've said that do so because they haven't seen many movies.  But equally, it isn't a complete waste of money.  I'm a big advocate of seeing a movie for what it is - entertainment.  ""Save the Last Dance"" sells itself on the dance scenes and on the young, attractive and talented people in it. They may not get a chance to show their talent, but they go through the motions, piecing together the dance sequences with a plot we've all heard before.<br/><br/>Plenty of people have noted that this film shows how Stiles is en route to stardom. I disagree.  Having seen ""Ten Things..."", I desperately wanted to see more of her, and this was one of the reasons I saw ""Last Dance"". Unfortunately, it seems from the rash of trailers that Stiles is in, she's fallen into the trap of believing any part is a good part at this point in her career.  Let's just hope that career lasts long enough to shadow the less laudable roles she's taking at the moment.<br/><br/>In Summary: don't expect too much.  The film addresses familiar issues in a mildly different context to normal, has a catchy soundtrack, and some truly enjoyable dance scenes [choreographic influences ranging from Bourne to Breakbeat - has to be impressive]. Just go see the film expecting a Teen Dance flick, and you'll enjoy it."

Stiles is a great actress and Thomas really connected with his character. He was a recognizable character on many fronts and I liked that. Washington was great as Chenille and certainly made the part hers. Fredro Star tends to play these characters alot and it's getting tedious because I know he's not really like that. Play something else. His acting seems forced and it messes with Thomas' acting when they're together. The plot was awesome as was the choreography.

"KerryW","Null","0","2","30 March 2001"," Another Predictable Teen Flick
","Since the advent of the MTV age, Hollywood has been obsessed with films aimed at the teen generation. A disjointed love story mixed with a half-decent soundtrack has always been a recipe for success amongst America's youth. Julia Stiles (Ten Things I Hate About You) is just one of the young starlets who have been moulded into a stereotypical teen actress and her role as Sara in Save The Last Dance is no different.<br/><br/>Keen ballet dancer Sara has been forced to move to Chicago to stay with her father after the death of her mum back in the mid-west. In a predominantly black school, she finds solace through tough but clever student, Derek (Patrick Thomas). As the pair become closer through their love of dancing, the racial tension grows with Derek's jealous ex (Bianca Lawson) singling out Sara. Derek fares little better as his best friend Malakai (Fredro Starr) also decides a white-black combination simply doesn't fit.<br/><br/>Julia Stiles is used to a Shakespearean theme after the remakes of Othello (O), The Taming of the Shrew (Ten Things I Hate About You) and Hamlet. She remains on familiar ground here as Save The Last Dance is essentially a cross between Romeo and Juliet and Dirty Dancing. The main problem simply lies with the predictability of it all: it's all been seen and done before.<br/><br/>The dance scenes are for the most part well choreographed, although the constant cutting of the director does become annoying. The script flows neatly too, but again some scenes spoil the whole balance. Sara's dance scene in the all-black club with everyone cheering is reminiscent and just as ridiculous as Sylvester Stallone being cheered by the Russians in Rocky 4.<br/><br/>Similarly the girl's cat-fight is as tame as a Frank Bruno bout, yet Sara ends up looking like she's gone twelve rounds with Tyson. It simply doesn't wash.<br/><br/>Save The Last Dance is a reasonable film with a decent soundtrack, but if you're looking for something with substance that might surprise you then you're not going to find it here.<br/><br/>The biggest tragedy of them all is that Julia Stiles is a genuinely good actress. Her only problem is that she's stuck in the same mould as Kirsten Dunst and Natalie Portman and until she can find that role to define her it looks as if she's going to be stuck in conventional teen flicks like this.<br/><br/>6/10<br/><br/>Kerry Wilkinson"
