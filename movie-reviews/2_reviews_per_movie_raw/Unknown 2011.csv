","Multiple people have compared this to Neeson's 2008 release of ""Taken."" Both have a similar concept; Liam goes on a fast-paced journey to retrieve something special that has been taken from him. This time it is not his daughter; it is his mind. Unlike ""Taken,"" ""Unknown"" is more of a suspense mystery than an action flick.

Good suspense— the sound mixers must've had a kick in adding emphasis on sound effects to startle the audience. The one thing I will note is that Liam Neeson is really showing his age. This is not necessarily a bad thing; on the contrary, it helps his character out. It gets tiresome that Hollywood always uses the generic 30-something year old actor with smashing abs who is tossed into a terrible situation. It is nice to see an aging actor play an upper middle-aged man who has perhaps lost his mind while running away from people trying to kill him. <br/><br/>My rating: ***/****"

","This may be a spoiler for you, so read no further unless you have seen the film and can understand what I am talking about. Typically, a patient with a head injury and memory loss has primarily short-term memory loss, while retaining long-term (which is how he knows him name, for instance, and whether he is actually married). This man's memory loss is the opposite - he knows his (phony) name, insists that he is married to his fellow spy, which he is not, but does not remember what his real occupation is and the bad things he has done in the past. Works for the plot, but is medically inaccurate. I also question why his journal, which must have been in his pocket when he went into the river, looks only slightly water-damaged, and the ink isn't smudged at all. Please!"
"classicalsteve","7","132","164","26 February 2011"," Finely Constructed Thriller Which Keeps You Guessing All the Way: Sort of Robert Ludlum Meets To Tell the Truth
","I guess if you really want to put an American in a harsh situation, have him lose his memory in a foreign country. For Americans that's probably the closest thing to Hell on Earth, right up there with being denied Monday Night Football in Hi-Def. (Just kidding) A few films have similar premises of an American being a fish out of his own waters: ""the Bourne Identity"", ""Frantic"", and ""Seven Days Seven Nights"". Hollywood is also replete with stories about people either losing their memories or simply being ""lost"" inside a political situation because of forces beyond their control, such as ""the Changeling"", Hitchcock's ""Spellbound"", ""the Truman Show""; even ""Total Recall"" and ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" have similarities.<br/><br/>The one element that saves these movies is the premise of the main character being in essentially a ""no win situation"". Despite how contrived or ""unrealistic"" the whole plot is, if the character is interesting enough, and the situation compelling enough, then you tend to run with it. Part of the fun is learning the greater story along with the character. It may have become a rather over-used plot devise, but it tends to work, in part because pieces of the puzzle can be thrown at the character without him understanding what it means.<br/><br/>""Unknown"" falls into this category of a character being trapped in a situation he does not completely understand, and the story is told almost entirely from the his point of view. After a near-death experience in Berlin, an American wakes up in a hospital room and his only knowledge is that he is Dr Martin Harris and he was there for a Biotech conference. But he has lost his identification along the way, and no one seems to believe him. He even returns to the hotel where he was supposed to be staying and finds his wife. Except his wife not only denies him but appears to be married to a man also by the name of Dr Martin Harris. Will the real Martin Harris please stand up? Starts to ring of a suspense version of the old television show ""To Tell the Truth"" where three people would claim they were the same person, and panelists would try to figure out who was the ""real"" person.<br/><br/>I don't see ""and the nominees for Best Actor are Liam Neeson for Uknown"" in the near future, but at the same time it really is Neeson who makes the entire film work. His honesty as an actor delivers a performance right on the money that kept me on the edge of my seat most of the way, to the point where I really wanted to know how he would get out of this. I never quite fell out of my chair, the way I did when I saw the original ""the Bourne Identity"" with Richard Chamberlain, but ""Unknown"" is first-rate entertainment of the escapist variety.<br/><br/>The two leading ladies also keep the entertainment level high, particularly January Jones (of Mad Men fame) who plays against type, as the loyal wife turned traitor. And Diane Kruger as a Bosnian refugee who is working in Berlin to eventually get her immigration papers reluctantly befriends Neeson and becomes an integral part of the plot. Roger Ebert in his review points out that a lot of things are too coincidental. Yeah...it's a suspense/action movie. So what else is new? If there's anything I can say about ""Unknown"" is you'll never find yourself looking at your watch, which is pretty high praise these days."
"g-bodyl","8","27","31","25 January 2013"," Crafty Thriller!
","Liam Neeson is turning into quite an action star these days despite his advancing age. After starring in the surprise action hit Taken, Liam tries his hand at another similar movie except with a much fewer body count. Unknown is a crafty little thriller set in international lands and is much better than I expected it to be. I thought this would be almost like a sequel to Taken but what I got was a tense, smartly-written thriller.<br/><br/>This film is about a husband, Dr. Martin Harris and a wife, Liz who travels to Germany because of a press conference. After suffering in an accident, Martin wakes up to find out his whole world is turned upside down when he finds out his wife does not recognize him and an impostor has taken his place. Now, he has to face many challenges if he is to get things back to normal.<br/><br/>Liam Neeson is making a name for himself as an action star. He was pretty good to watch in this movie. The supporting cast led by January Jones, Diane Kruger, and Frank Langella is really good as well.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a tense thriller which is way better than the release date it had would suggest. This movie was slow at times and it reminded me greatly of Harrison Ford's Frantic, but despite some clichés, the cast and some tense moments rose this film above mediocrity. I rate this film 8/10."
"yris2002","7","88","114","28 February 2011"," Involving and well interpreted action-thriller
","The movie sounds intriguing since from the beginning and keeps its sense of mystery and intrigue till the end: this is a good quality, once reminding Hitchcock's thrillers, with the difference that in ""Unknown"" the thrilling aspect cannot be separated from the frenzy typical of action movies. The result is an entertaining, involving pic, never losing its strong and quick rhythm and letting the viewer staying attached to the screen till the end. Set in a depressing Berlin covered by snow, always marked by the sad signs of a more or less distant past, a good photography gets to capture the overall gloomy atmosphere of the story and the mystery of a character whose vicissitudes seem as much incomprehensible as much needing some resolution, and an effective final twist as well. Liam Neeson plays skillfully, although not always sufficiently expressive, he gets to convey the sense of void of someone looking for some identity. A stand-out performance is offered by Bruno Ganz and also Diane Kruger supports Neeson quite well. Certainly not a masterpiece, but worth the ticket."

","Anyone who has watched Liam Neeson's movies have grown accustom to a character that is always thrown into absurd situations but can still somehow use wit, power and skills to get himself out. Unknown offers the same formula but it still works. This movie caught my attention from the get go. I enjoy how Liam is believable in these roles and you forget that he's getting up there in age, if anything, he makes it seem like this is what any man his age is capable of. He is awaken from a coma to discover that his identity has been taken by someone else. Worst yet, his wife doesn't seem to recognize him. With the help of the woman that saved his life, in a country that is not his home, Liam seeks about to prove himself. This movie is action packed and keeps you on the edge while you try to figure out what is going on. And I feel the ending does not disappoint. Enjoyable, entertaining, action packed and thrilling!"
"andybac","8","124","178","18 February 2011"," It's all in the ending
","An effective thriller with a good twist in the ending. Not since The Sixth Sense has a movie given me such a surprise at its ending. Liam Nieson keeps your attention fixed on the action throughout the movie, although some of his lines did not match the scenes or his character. If someone is trying to kill you, maybe some emotion would be shown. The car accident at the beginning is very realistic and makes Liams amnesia credible. The car chase scenes in the movie will also keep the action buffs happy, although the black car driven by the assassin is a bit too corny to believe . Bruno Ganz as an aging former Stasi agent gives a stand-out performance and Diane Kruger supports Nieson without the usual Hollywood theme of girl following for hero. Maybe its because Nieson is old enough to be her father. This film is no masterpiece but if your looking for a couple of hours entertainment with an interesting ending this will fit the bill."

The intriguing story seems to have flaws, but when the mystery is solved, everything has an explanation. Everything works in the thriller: performances, cinematography, music score and specially the twist. <br/><br/>The fifty-nine year-old Liam Neeson is impressively youthful and fits perfectly to the role of a man that loses part of his recollections, and the gorgeous Diane Kruger is excellent as usual. Despite their difference of ages, they are are convincing as a couple. My vote is eight.<br/><br/>Title (Brazil): ""Desconhecido"" (""Unknown"")"
"CryptoGuy","7","42","58","22 February 2011"," Bourne Again
","Unknown is good, but not great. It's worth a go at the theatre, but if you're expecting Taken, prepare for disappointment.<br/><br/>Liam Neeson is on top, giving a spotless performance. He is becoming more iconic and, therefore, his characters are starting to look the same. Not a bad thing if you're an actor (because you'll get more work and more money), but it can get tiresome for the audience. Fortunately, I'm not one of them. I enjoy Neeson in just about everything I see him in. Good for me and good for him as I'm sure the majority of movie-goers would agree.<br/><br/>Unknown is all three Bourne movies tied up in one. It's great for those that don't have the patience for a long wrap-up. There is a lot of detective work and very little action; however, when there is action, it is good, including a hair-raising car chase. The ending is weak, but hey, it's Hollywood. When was the last time you saw a great ending? Unknown is worth 8-9 bucks. Just be glad there isn't a 3D version for you to pay $15 for."
"socrates99","9","133","201","18 February 2011"," Not a bad action/drama - a good time at the movies
","It's one thing to be told not to think too hard about what you're about to see, it's another to be helped enormously in that task by a skilled director employing equally skilled actors. All the principals here are in top notch form and, though I enjoy trying to measure how much license was taken by a screenplay, this film never once made me feel cheated or resentful.<br/><br/>Is it a brilliant film? Probably not, but it's devilishly entertaining. The action scenes here are matched by the quiet drama scenes and that's unusual. I don't really think either sex can really claim it entirely.<br/><br/>The director's done a very good job of creating the right mood and telling the story in such a way that the actors can do their work, unimpeded by unrealistic run ups to their scenes. This movie made me feel as if I've just visited Berlin much more effectively than any other European based movie I can think of and that alone is worth the price of admission."

","This movie would have felt more original before Jason Bourne hit the screen, but we already have one black-op operative with amnesia out there. I truly wonder if anyone mentioned the similarities when this being proposed. Granted, there is a good plot twist when he is told who and what he is, but smart people would have noticed something wrong when he drives like a professional, and fights as if he'd been trained to. Just like Bourne. I did not find very many original concepts in this movie, and once I make the comparison to JB (sorry, I mean Bourne, not James Bond or Jack Bauer ... JB is just a good set of initials for this sort of thing I guess!) - I kept thinking that there was more ingenuity in the Bourne movies, and a lot more investment in character development. This movie is watchable. ... Barely. And I have no desire to watch it again."

","I wanted to love this film, as I'm a big fan of Liam Neeson.<br/><br/>This was a pretty good movie. It was overall enjoyable to watch, and it had good twists to the story. It was action packed, and as such Neeson delivers. January Jones is, unfortunately, a terribly cold actress and is the same character as all of her other films. I do like Diane Kruger though, and she was fairly charming in this.<br/><br/>I enjoyed watching it. It's a good weekend, sit-down-and-enjoy thrill movie, as one would expect from its description. It is by no means a movie I'd recommend for its artistic merit, but it definitely delivers in the traditional thrill-seeker movie. The plot is pretty good as well, and well executed."

The plot of ""Unknown"" is the latter, and Dr. Martin Harris (Neeson) attempts to investigate why someone (Aiden Quinn) is now Dr. Martin Harris and with his wife (January Jones). To do this, Harris must first find the taxi driver who saved his life (Kruger). Meanwhile, he desperately tries to reach a professor (Frank Langella) back at his college who can verify his identity.<br/><br/>This type of film, when done well, as this one was, moves quickly and has lots of actions in order to cover up the plot holes. There usually are some, but if the film is good, one doesn't mind. I have to say I really enjoyed this film, filmed mostly in and around Berlin. Good performances, very exciting, a couple of dandy car chases, and a neat twist. Highly recommended."
"BeneCumb","8","11","14","16 December 2012"," An elegant thriller, with several unpredictable twists
","This century has seen Liam Neeson in real leading roles, when his character ""permeates"" the whole movie and is strong and quick-witted. Taken 1 and 2 are best known, Unknown has - for some reason or another - remained in their shadow. In my opinion, the script of the latter is much stronger, has more twists-turns and unpredictable moments - me being a fan and active viewer of crime thrillers could not guess what kind of background could Neeson's character Dr. Martin Harris really have. Sequence of the events is logical and chases are visually enjoyable. The ending in general is predictable, apart from the very last scene.<br/><br/>Well, all the cast is excellent, not only Liam Neeson; Diane Kruger and Bruno Ganz are the supporting actors more time on screen and they are really good.

"bob-lambert","1","114","200","6 March 2011"," Absolute Rubbish
","An average story with some limited potential, but ruined by Liam Neeson's wooden acting, and ruined even more by some ridiculous script and plot elements. The lack of common sense displayed by any of the characters is even worse than in Taken, if such a thing is possible. I don't want to totally spoil the plot in case you still decide to watch this film, but let me give you three examples:<br/><br/>1. Neeson's character fights a man who attacks him, and eventually the man is overcome. Just before the assailant dies, Neeson bangs him against the floor demanding to know who he is, and who sent him. The man dies, saying nothing. Now, any normal person would go through the dead man's pockets for ID or for any other clue as to his purpose or identity. Equally, given his lack of cash at the time, you would expect Neeson simply to grab the dead man's wallet. You would also expect him to take the man's gun - after all his equally vicious partner is still armed and at large. What does Neeson's character do? Grab a notebook (essential to the plot, but he didn't know it at the time), then run away. Unknown 1 - Common Sense 0<br/><br/>2. Neeson and his female companion escape in a borrowed Taxi - a Mercedes saloon. The second armed assailant follows in a much larger and faster Mercedes 4x4. Ignore the ridiculous sound effects as Neeson repeatedly changes gear (note to sound effects: Mercedes saloon taxis do not have gearchange mechanisms that sound like Nascar sequential boxes). It is clear that the assailant's car is quicker and heavier, yet Neeson continues to try to outdrag him and barge him off the road. At no point does he do the obvious thing - let the man get slightly ahead (so Neeson's car is in his blind spot), then brake hard and take the assailant by surprise by turning left / right / U-turning, not even when the assailant is on the opposite side of the road, or behind a set of pillars where he couldn't react quickly even if he spotted the braking manoeuvre. Unknown 2 - Common Sense 0<br/><br/>3. Neeson's character retrieves a briefcase that contains documents vital to the plot, and to his identity. He has spent most of the film looking for this information, yet having found it what does he do? Set about proving his case? Call the investigator working for him to let him know? Go to the Authorities? Put the passport safely in his inside pocket, and lock the rest of the documents in his briefcase then put it in a safe place? No. In spite of being chased, shot at, and set up by various people, and in spite of still having no idea who the good guys and bad guys might be, or how many of them there are, or how to identify them, he sits at a table in a café, alternately waving his passport around or gazing at it for a few minutes, with the briefcase open and in full view on a chair beside him, inviting any passing bad guy to take and destroy the passport and the rest of the documents and other evidence. Unknown 3 - Common Sense 0<br/><br/>This is just the tip of the iceberg. The whole script is littered with scenes where any sensible person would have done almost entirely the opposite of what Neeson's character does. I'm not talking about suspension of disbelief for the basic plot (which I'm broadly quite happy with - after all, it's fiction for the purpose of entertainment), but characters who just do stupid things. What's more annoying is that the plot would have worked just as well if the characters had done sensible things - the stupid actions weren't vital to any of the key plot elements.<br/><br/>A waste of an afternoon. If it had been on TV I'd have turned it off and done the washing up instead."
"valrogm","1","57","98","31 March 2011"," A failed suspense film with an awful plot
","A good suspense film is supposed to keep to you guessing till the end. And when the explanation comes, you're supposed to remember several clues and go ""Ohhhhhh. I can't believe I didn't notice that"", as was done very well in The Sixth Sense. Unknown failed on both counts.<br/><br/>After a short while into the film it becomes abundantly clear that Neeson's character isn't Martin Harris and his wife isn't who she claims to be either. Not only does the other guy have documents with photos proving his identity, his wife - under no coercion - also denies knowing him. But we are shown at the beginning of the film that Liz is his wife. These two facts made it obvious that neither person was who they claimed to be. If Neeson's character was Martin Harris, why would the other guy have photos and why would Liz - his wife of 5 years - deny knowing him? If Liz were his wife, why would she deny him under no coercion, even after we are shown that she's his wife in the beginning? Neeson's character's tired line ""I am Martin Harris!!"" re-used for over an hour only succeed in provoking a groaning in the audience - ""We already know that you're not Martin Harris. Move on, please"". That really should not happen in a suspense film - the audience should not have a better understanding of the world than the characters themselves.<br/><br/>As for the ending, they could have pretty much substituted anything else, and the movie would have been the same. I didn't feel that there was any buildup of clues culminating in the ending. It was completely separate from the rest of the movie.<br/><br/>The plot was also weird and many of the characters did the exact opposite of what you would realistically expect. Take the ex-secret's service agent Bruno, for example. Knowing that an assassin was coming for him, why didn't he lay a trap for him? He didn't have to run (that was such a lame excuse). He could have simply fired 6 bullets through the door the moment the assassin rang the bell. Is that so hard to think of, Mr. experienced know-it-all ex-spy?? <br/><br/>Gina's character also didn't seem plausible. She's supposed to be a semi-literate illegal immigrant. Yet she acts like a veteran secret agent or commando. She kills two notorious assassins by just knocking them off a bridge with a car, in a scene that appeared to have been ripped off from a Laurel and Hardy comedy.<br/><br/>What about the deadly assassin - invented in the last few minutes of the film? Sure, he might have thought that he was just a professor, but even if he were not psychologically confident in combat, he should have been in incredible physical shape. I would have expected him to kick those guys' ass in such an efficient manner that it surprised him. I would have also expected flashbacks of his having killed people before while he was defending himself.<br/><br/>I thought it was a very weak plot device that he could only get flashbacks of those false memories and not a single true memory of having been an assassin.<br/><br/>Sure, there were some great actors in the film - especially Neeson and Jurgen. But having good actors can't save a movie that has a very bad script like this one. Disappointing 1/10."

","As far as the movie goes, it was OK, we have Diane Kruger with a Russian accent, we have Liam Neeson being Liam Neeson. But this idea has been done before way better. Anyone remember 'Total Recall'? This movie was like that, but lamer. I gave this movie such a poor rating because by the half of it I knew, as well as my boyfriend, what was going to happen. So, if the plot doesn't hold any surprises, plus it recycles an old idea hopping that no one will remember and the action scenes are pretty weak(not to mention few, all involving taxis), then I say it is not worth watching...at the cinema anyway. And I also have a problem with the unnecessary killing of bystanders, which most of the times simply doesn't make sense(the bed guys kill anyone they meet but somehow they hesitate when it comes to Diane Kruger's character)."

In Unknown, he wanders through the almost entire length of the movie thinking he's a Doctor.

I don't mind meeting a movie halfway...but really now...<br/><br/>-The cab driver who rescues Neesom from her cab as it sinks in a river is an illegal alien.

Right.<br/><br/><ul><li>Those contrivances are nothing compared to the garbage the viewer is asked to believe as this movie rolls on. The whole sinister plot to get close enough to a scientist so they can kill him without looking like they killed him is absurd. The same group that puts these complex assassinations together apparently are bumbling idiots when it comes to offing old dudes with memory loss issues.</li></ul><br/><br/>-To sum up the utter stupidity. it's revealed that Neesom is actually a highly trained killer with multiple identities. Yet after (finally) being tasered into submission and thrown into a van, what happens next? The bad guys simply execute Neesom and all the people who tried to kill him for the previous 2 hours get a good chewing out, right?<br/><br/>Wrong.<br/><br/>For some reason, they take him to a parking garage, where it's explained to him that his bumped head is putting their stupid year-long plan in danger, and so we're gonna have to kill you now. But first, let's take some more time to beat the crap out of Liam for a few more minutes, before actually killing him by drug overdose, so the death will appear accidental. ??????????????????????????????????<br/><br/>This of course gives his new partner just enough time to track him down, because the bad guys parked just close enough to the edge of the parking garage for her to spot them as she glanced up on the way by.

I'm glad that I changed my mind because this movie had me on the edge of my seat for almost the entire two hours.<br/><br/>The gloomy, mysterious setting of wintertime Berlin engages the viewer from the film's first moments. The film is a bit heavy on action-focused scenes, but the intriguing characters are easy to follow nonetheless. Liam Neeson and Diane Kruger give excellent performances. Some may call the ending predictable, but I found it quite surprising. I have read some reviews which are critical of the fact that the entire assassination scheme is planned around a botanist who has developed a new type of hybrid corn. Personally, I think this element enhances the film by making it relevant to a contemporary social and biological concern. Not only does the film highlight the issue of world hunger, but it also references illegal immigration and the attitudes of legal citizens toward aliens. Overall, Unknown is a great thriller which served its purpose of providing high-quality entertainment. For all these reasons, I would consider seeing this movie a second time prior to the DVD release.<br/><br/>However, a few issues may prove disappointing or puzzling for some viewers. Neeson's character is confused by the numbers written in his book throughout the entire movie. Then suddenly, he is able to determine that they form a ""simple code."" He still doesn't know what the code means, so how does he know that he has interpreted it correctly? This was my first thought, but once the viewer discovers that he is a trained assassin, it makes more sense that he would suddenly regain decoding skills that he presumably forgot following the accident at the beginning of the film.<br/><br/>Another issue is that the man who attempts to kill Neeson in the hospital does so by injecting a lethal substance into a slow-drip intravenous line. This makes no sense, considering that he broke the necks of two nurses with his own hands just to gain access to Neeson. At such a slow drip rate and with the obvious diffusion of the lethal chemical into a bag of saline solution, the IV drip could have taken 30 minutes to an hour to kill him, depending upon the type of substance. Why kill him so slowly? <br/><br/>Neeson's conversion from heartless assassin to hero will be unbelievable for some viewers. Perhaps the filmmakers want us to assume that Neeson's true, good nature is finally able to emerge after the accident has wiped his former life from his mind. If this is the case, I think the film offers an admirable narrative of redemption, commenting on humanity's ability to do good once the path to good becomes clear. But since many people do not hold this positive view of humanity, the point may be harder for some viewers to see.<br/><br/>I would recommend this movie to anyone seeking an entertaining thriller with substantial plot twists. Don't go into this movie expecting it to be 100% realistic. Enjoy it for what it is, and judge for yourself."
"jmcginn174","4","19","30","16 June 2011"," It's simply not a good movie.
","Warning there might be some spoilers ahead. I haven't seen a movie in just about two months since Tron Legacy. There wasn't anything that interested me until UNKNOWN. It looked like it would be a good action/suspense movie but I was wrong. I'll be blunt this movie was pretty boring. It's kind of reminds me of The American with George Clooney. It had potential but failed to rise above ordinary to bad.<br/><br/>The story follows Dr. Martin Harris(Liam Neeson) and Elizabeth Harris(January Jones) who have arrived in Berlin for a conference. Things are going well for them until Martin gets into a accident. When he awakes he finds out there's someone else has taken over his life and impersonating him. Things go from bad to worse when he tries to prove who he is. The overall story isn't very good a plot to assassinate someone at the conference. The intriguing part is Martin. Is he really Martin Harris or is the other Martin the real one. The payoff worked well when you find out who he really is. The problem with the story is the pacing and the editing of the story. How many minutes were wasted with Martin just wandering the streets. I mean it must have been ten minutes. Then there was the action which was few an far between and outside of one good scene was bad. Then there was the ending which planned sucked.<br/><br/>The acting was what hurt the movie the most. All the lead actors seemed to be on autopilot through this movie. Liam Neeson did a OK job. There were times he did a great job and there were others he seemed to be on autopilot. Aidan Quinn and January Jones seemed like zombies. The only one of the leads that showed any real emotion was Diana Kruger(Gina). Because of the bad acting you or at least I ended up not caring one bit about any of them. Oh one of them died all well who cares and you move one. The actor who stole the show and the film was a supporting actor. His name is Bruno Ganz. I had never heard of him before. He plays Ernst Jürgen a ex Stasi(The East German State Security) officer. His character is the most intriguing and surprisingly the most likable. Ernst is also in the best scene in the movie. Where he is at his home with Rodney Cole(Frank Langella). This two veteran actors do a superb job but again Bruno is the one that shines. To be honest I wish the made the movie about his character.<br/><br/>Now back to the action that was hard to find. The fight scenes weren't very well done. The climax in a hotel was done terribly. Maybe the director wanted to rely on the mystery and suspense but those two weren't good enough make this a good movie. I don't mind movies with out a long of action but when there is it had better be good. The only really great action scene in the near midway part of the film where there is a car chase in the streets of Berlin which I thought was really well done.<br/><br/>As for directing by Jaume Collet-Serra was bad. Which I guess shouldn't be surprising once I found out who he was and what he directed before. He's only directed four movies and the only one I know about or seen is the god awful HOUSE OF WAX. I wish the movie studio had found someone else to direct this movie maybe then it would have been better.<br/><br/>Overall a below average to bad action/suspense movie that I'd skip if I were you."
"wildphoenix960","9","45","80","18 February 2011"," Good thriller, but don't go in expecting more than Taken.
","Movie was great, but I think a few things fell a little short.<br/><br/>Like another reviewer, dialog did not match up with what was going on at some parts. Not that it made or break the movie. Especially one part where he says, ""I remember how to kill you"". Which is said on the trailer of the movie, then he says a-hole after it and it becomes sometimes notttttt so cool to say and kinda made me want to laugh.<br/><br/>Action was great for when it happened, which was NOT the whole movie as somebody else said in their review. It starts kind of slow, but builds up towards middle/ending. Expected a little more from the ending because previous action scenes were better, but it was still good.<br/><br/>Probably one of the few things I did not like about this movie was the camera work. During fast paced scenes and some action scenes it was kinda all over and was hard to follow the characters. The action that I did catch was great though.<br/><br/>It has more of a story and big twist than Taken. Though there is going to be a Taken 2, I would suggest just comparing this to Bournes a little more with a fighting style of Taken. Good movie and worth the money. 8/10 because I only see myself watching it a few times on DVD (same with Taken and Bourne)."
"rstrachwitz","1","62","115","6 March 2011"," Don't believe the good reviews
","One of the most embarrassing, painful and boring movies within the last decade. Zero suspense. Awful script. Talking heads with dialogue making no sense at all (Gretchen: He's finding people). It starts with the question: how can a super-killer-agent be stupid enough to forget his suitcase at the airport? and it ends with the question: how can a director and his producers be brainless enough to expect that people haven't seen Total Recall and Bourne Identity to make this movie as predictable as a Mickey-Mouse-comic. Don't believe whatever good reviews you might have read. You'll want your money back after having wasted the first ten minutes with this terrible mistake."

","Beforehand I didnt expect anything from this movie, I just wanted to watch a B-movie, with lots of action and thrills, to keep me awake. But I got more than I expected, and although I was sleepy when I started watching it, I was wide awake midway through. This is just another one of those unmistakable well made Liam Neeson thrillers.<br/><br/>If you liked the Liam Neeson Taken series then you will surely love this movie as well. It' s fast, suspenseful and with lots of slick and cool looking photography and editing. I mention these technical details, because lots of action movies just dont get it right when it comes to fastpaced action photography. This one does.<br/><br/>Liam Neeson travels abroad with his wife for business. He gets into a car accident by himself and when he wakes up in a hospital, someone else has taken his identity.This story might sound ridiculous, and for sure, it is a bit of a ridiculous story, but it is executed in such a way that is still quite suspenseful and captivating.<br/><br/>There are many resemblances with the Bourne movies. Memory loss, being chased by assasins in foreign countries (Germany), fast action sequences and lots of suspense. It is a really decent action thriller, which the fans of this genre will surely have a good time with. It is a bit better than the average action movie, although dont expect originality either..."

"rmax304823","5","10","15","26 November 2011"," Indelicate Stitching.
","Every time one of these characters suffers a trauma and can't recall his true identity -- whether it's Matt Damon in ""The Bourne Identity"" or Geena Davis in ""The Long Kiss Goodnight"" -- they always discover in the end that they are amnesic assassins. Inevitably they're assassins. They never wake up to find that they used to be bus boys in a restaurant or gas station attendants on the night shift. They're always skilled killers.<br/><br/>It's no surprise that that's what happens to Liam Neeson in this action-filled and thoroughly routine thriller.<br/><br/>The writers, the director, and everyone else associated with this production have a lot to answer for because the central idea of questionable identity is itself so packed with resonance. Who among us hasn't asked himself, ""Who the hell am I really?"" But that's the genre. It has its cachet. More than that, though, is the generic form itself: the person who finds himself adrift, a stranger in a strange land, where the people have queer customs and don't speak the same language and nobody understands what you say or, if they understand, can't bring themselves to believe it, as in Roman Polanski's ""Frantic"", a much better film despite its absurdity. That's the glorious summit. A guy who doesn't know who he is, in a place in which he doesn't know his way around. I once found myself in that position -- trying to locate a toilet in a huge hotel in an exotic land, and it was no picnic, let me tell you.<br/><br/>This is one cliché cobbled together with every other cliché the writers could think of. The goal is strictly commercial. ""Art"" is somebody's name.<br/><br/>We have -- spectacularly -- an urban car chase for a change. The cutting is instantaneous. The night-time streets are crowded with traffic (but not enough to impede the speeding cars), slippery, and glistening with neon reflections. The horns of terrified innocent motorists blare and dwindle with the Doppler effect. Look out -- there's a trolley coming! Shots of the hero's twisted face last a fraction of a second. One car tries to bump the other off the street at high speed. A sedan slides into a 180 degree turn. One of them hits a pile of garbage and does a half twist in the air before landing on its roof and sliding to a halt amid a shower of fake sparks.<br/><br/>Why go on? Well, one more thing that always bamboozles me because it violates one of Newton's laws. In desperation, Neeson grabs up a sliver of broken mirror and plunges it into the villain's neck without its doing any damage to his hand. It's like seeing one fighter decking another by bumping foreheads.<br/><br/>I kind of like Liam Neeson. His drooping nose begins in the middle of his forehead and he looms over everyone else on the streets of Berlin. (He would loom even more gigantically if it were Tokyo.) I enjoyed his Russian companion too. She's not staggeringly beautiful but Russian accents sound so compellingly fragile in women. Neesom's ""wife"", on the other hand, can't really act believably but doesn't have to. No one has ever looked more elegant and cool and blond in a black backless dress.<br/><br/>Best performance award -- envelope, please -- Frank Langella. From a handsome Lothario in the 60s he's turned into a marvelous character actor. He's the only person in the film who gives a truly convincing performance, but Bruno Ganz as a sympathetic botanist isn't far behind. Langella gets the best lines too, though the writers don't spare him the clichés either. Best One-Way Ticket To Purgatory -- Flavio Labiano, the cinematographer, for yet another ghoulish green action movie. Any more of this and I'll have to ask the nurse for Dramamine."

The couple are there to assassinate a scientist who has developed a new crop of corn that would possibly be able to end world hunger. However, this is not revealed until late in the film.<br/><br/>Neeson's character wakes up in a Berlin hospital after having just woke up from the wreck induced coma. Forgetting who he is, he believes that he is Dr. Martin Harris; which is is his cover to execute the CIA plan. He is convinced that his partner is in fact his real wife as their fictionalized back story becomes reality for him. Further into the film, people begin attempting to murder him. It is obvious that because he has the ability to compromise the assassination plan, people want him dead.<br/><br/>He teams up Gina (Kruger), the taxi driver from the crash, in order to fight those who wish him harm. Once he starts to recover some of his lost thoughts, the assassination plan comes back to the man's memory. He decides that it is necessary to try to stop the assassination attempt. After much exciting action packed scenes; he does all of this successfully, leaving this film to end on a happy note.<br/><br/>In all truthfulness, the viewer must completely abandon all sense of logic for this movie to be enjoyed. Sure, there is an amazing twist in the film once it is realized who Neeson's character really is and; of course, the trailers for the film give the viewer a completely different preconceived idea.

","An ingenious script that echoes concepts, plotting, pace and intrigue from mysteries such as Nowhere Man, Frantic and The Bourne Identity. Once again, Liam Neeson shows his prowess in choosing projects of high interest and executes a performance that connects well with his audience.<br/><br/>To put this in context, mystery thrillers are very hard to pull off anymore. Filmmakers must create layers of mysteries that the audience cannot easily second guess, peel them back one by one to reveal answers that themselves sometimes turn into mysteries later, and resolve all of them in 2 hours without seeming contrived or obvious. To make it more challenging, the characters must be empathetic, the action sequences satisfying, the pace agreeable, the dialog convincing, and the setting compelling.<br/><br/>Director Jaume Collet-Serra has pulled it off again, following on the heels of another successful thriller, Orphan.

"chrisalsop1213","Null","39","81","14 March 2011"," Pretty damn subpar for a 30 million dollar movie
","First off, what a brutal title. I mean c'mon. There's at least 5 other films prior to this that have already used it... what happened to at least trying to be original? I went in to this movie kinda stoked because I really dug Neeson's last film Taken. But within the first 5 mins I knew this film was already in trouble. First off, both Neeson's character and the cab driver forget to take Neeson's briefcase off the luggage dolly. Really????!!! So beyond obvious but whatever, I'll go with it. Then as Neeson races back to retrieve it, he can't get a cell phone signal while trying to call his wife??????!!!!!! He's in the middle of Berlin for Christ sake!!!! He's not on some backwoods road or out in the middle of nowhere. C'MON!!!! Throughout the movie, things like this continue to happen. The acting is so rigid. Neeson ain't that great and the chick playing his wife is horrible. The action is few and far between and the actual story is frustrating to watch. Everything was so subpar. The only decent part of the film was the young girl who helps out Neeson. She actually kicks way more ass than he does. He's actually pretty useless. There is also an unintentionally hilarious scene where Neeson and the guy who has assumed his identity rattle off identical sentences simultaneously. The theater was laughing while poor Liam was trying to be serious. I just paid $11 for this crap. Was it the worst movie I've ever seen? No. but considering it's a film with a 30 million dollar budget... then it could be up there."

At this point I was divided as to what is going on. Is this a Twilight Zone where a guy goes to an alternate reality? Maybe a ""Dark City"" experiment. Is this an elaborate hoax? If so why is his wife a part of it? Maybe they decided to remake Hauser's Memory (am I showing my age?)

","Judging by the poster and the plot synopsis this movie seemed like a cash-in on the success of ""Taken"" (even more so than ""Taken 2""), but I was surprised by the different style and the fact that Neeson is slightly less implausibly bad-ass. He's just an average guy that tries to prove everybody is framing him, he doesn't do much fighting but it isn't required to keep the compelling plot interesting. The story is genuinely well-crafted and gives you a conclusion that you don't see coming from miles away (unless you're amazing at that type of thing). Oh, and Bruno ""hey, isn't that Hitler from Der Untergang?"" Ganz is in this, a highly underrated actor that effortlessly adds a bit of class to any movie he's in.

It was as usual fun to watch the so-called bad people get what was coming to them. A great story of redemption and at asking the question do we ever really know who we are deep down inside or is it all a trick of the mind.

","Jason Bourne meets Harrison Ford in ""Frantic"". Maybe that was the pitch though I doubt Polanski's '88 thriller would ring many bells with today's Hollywood green lighters. ""Unknown"" Liam Neeson is quoted as saying (IMDB) ""Acting is invigorating. But I don't analyse it too much. It's like a dog smelling where it's going to do its toilet in the morning."" Judging by this and other recent performances Mr Neeson will produce ordure at will. Diane Kruger has a brave stab at the beautiful-but-complex European babe so excellently portrayed by Emmanuelle Seigner and Franka Potente in the films mentioned earlier, but is let down badly by the stale material, laughable plot and the appallingly wooden acting of her main man, not to mention the sub-Sweeney awfulness of the baddies. But perhaps the most shocking waste here is the talent of Bruno Ganz and Frank Langella. Having to watch Bruno go through some truly terrible exposition when explaining to dimwitted Neeson what the Stasi was - ""you mean the East German secret police??"" - I had to shed a tear for this star of Wings of Desire. As for Langella, a man who gave a masterclass performance in Polanski's much underrated Ninth Gate, the best thing that can be said about him is how he wore his raincoat.<br/><br/>I can understand why older actors are keen to keep going and even getting caught up in nonsense like this for a hip young Spanish director of music videos might seem flattering and rejuvenating but it is a poor day for movie lovers when they are required to turn in work like this.<br/><br/>As for the subject of amnesia, it has boundless possibilities, even within the confines of a commercial thriller. But ""Unknown"" is not the answer and unknown is what this film will be on supermarket discount shelves in a few short months."

I put it on my Netflix queue and just received it in the mail the other day.<br/><br/>I finally got around to watching it and I have to say...I'm not sure why I even thought this looked interesting.

","I guess anyone deprived of his identity would feel shocked and be willing to do anything to get his life back. In Unknown there is a lot of passivity all around from Martin Harris (Liam Neeson). I do not know if the book was better at this but on the big screen you spend more time waiting with the protagonist than watching him actually fighting to solve the issue.<br/><br/>You get a sense of despair but it is a mainstream movie so this development is minimal and entirely left to Liam Neeson's acting skills - which have been stretched to the point where you may have grown tired of with all the Taken-like flimsy thrillers that do rely on him to flesh up dumb archetypes.<br/><br/>There is a bunch of fine actors here but the movie is totally uninteresting. The storyline only gets us from a first part where we have no clue about the solution to the final part where everything is gradually exposed - without Martin Harris ever fighting for any part, everything is just thrown at him 'ex machina', in due time.<br/><br/>And worst of all the solution is boring, it feels like a plot written by a 12 year old, and doesn't look any better in moving pictures. Non-stop by the same star/director team is equally unimpressive, with the same loose script approach that quickly undermine the potential for suspense and tense action."

","Unknown is a stylish, atmospheric film, yet it is not particularly memorable. It has a pretty effective opening, setting up an intriguing mystery for which the plot of this movie is based around.<br/><br/>The film boasts a fantastic cast including supporting roles for veterans Frank Langella and Bruno Ganz. Both actors are the best aspects of the movie and would have been nice to have seen more from them. Liam Neeson is a very entertaining screen presence as usual. He is a reliable lead and is enjoyable to watch. January Jones has the look of a classic Hitchcockian blonde, but unfortunately, she has very little to do.<br/><br/>While the movie is filled with these great actors, the characters they play are pretty standard. They lacked any real depth, as did the film itself. While Neeson and co-star Diane Kruger are never unlikeable, there is an emotional distance between their characters and the audience.<br/><br/>The tone of this movie is sombre, yet the plot is quite silly. It also features some over the top action, which didn't fit with this tone, including scenes in which Kruger's taxi driver fights against professionally trained bodyguards.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a solid thriller. It is well made and features an interesting central mystery. Unfortunately, it is unremarkable and not very rewatchable."

","I just don't buy the things that is happening in the movie. What I mean is that he gets hit in the head and get amnesia, only remembering some things, things so he think he is the character that he is acting. This seems to convenient to me. How can he remember just that. The thing also about that is it seems that they had not played their rolls for that long of a time. All the memories he has to begin with has nothing to do with his ""roll"". That begs the question, what do he remember? He cant remember himself teaching or having any moment at home with his wife because he has never done that in his roll. For that matter the other members of his crew act very strange during all this. They don't contact him or try to explain to him the situation in any way. They even almost hit him with their cat at one moment. They even try to kill him. Then their leader says that he his the person he plays likes that is things that happens. How? He has never really played his roll. Its lucky that they had a reserve for his roll, and that his how I know he never really has played his roll, because no one knows how he looks like.<br/><br/>Then we can look at this organizations plan to begin with. They want a scientists research and then kill him so they will be the only ones with it, so they can sell it I think. Why do they need to kill him? He most likely has his research in other locations. If not he is stupid. Anyway it seems important that no one knows that he was the target and his research was stolen. This complex plan comes down to that They know that the scientist never would leave his research and always carries his computer with him. They will then convince him to leave it in the wardrobe. Then they will use some kind of USP WiFi on his computer to steal the research. This part of the plan I think is ridicules and is based on a lot of assumptions which might not work. It is just luck that they succeed with that part and that seems so random when the rest of the very complicated plan(which to me seems you could solve much easier) is so though out."

Liam is a rock (not The Rock) in the lead, now thoroughly established as a main man in the action movie business, and he has excellent support from Frank Langella, Diane Kruger and January Jones, but it is Bruno Ganz who steals the show in terms of acting chops as a former Stasi officer, indeed the short scene that he shares with Langella is the film's most tense and poignant, superb acting. There's something of the feel of Roman Polanski's 'Frantic' in the perilous pursuit through a European capital, although this is a grittier affair and probably the better for it. Not to be confused with 'Taken' which is a completely different animal."

There are car chases, people jumping back and forth, quite a number of dead people etc... Of course none of this makes any sense whatsoever. You could poke thousand holes per minute if you were so inclined. But, to what purpose? The filmmakers didn't lie nor misrepresent themselves. It is what it is. Liam Neeson, a very talented actor, suffers from the same ailment that any reluctant action hero does. Too busy running and ducking to act.

","It's really hard for me to dislike a Liam Neeson movie. He has an incredible knack for raising an otherwise crappy movie to a fairly enjoyable movie. This is definitely the case with this movie.<br/><br/>Unknown doesn't really have a lot else going for it. It's one of those thrillers that you know has some twist that they're just waiting to reveal, and you know these movies only use about four different twists so it's pretty easy to figure it out. And even though you already sort of know the plot, it's really hard to follow. You'll find yourself asking what's going on constantly because it's not always clear what the characters are trying to do or why they're trying to do it. I know that that's sort of to be expected in a thriller, but not when you're trying to figure out why the guy trying to unravel the mystery is making a phone call.<br/><br/>Even after you figure out what's going on, you realize that the whole plot is full of holes. There's a scene at the end where Liam Neeson is fighting an assassin and gets hit on the head thus restoring his memories(because that's how concussions work, right?). The big twists explained earlier is that Liam Neeson was actually a spy trying to kill a scientist so he can steal his formula for crops that can grow anywhere(this plot point has it's own set of holes, that I don't need to address here). So, Liam Neeson got his memories back and he uses it to remember his assassin training to kill the assassin that was sent in to replace him. But if Liam Neeson got his memories back, wouldn't he go back to a state of wanting to kill the scientist? Wouldn't he remember why he was going to kill him in the first place? I can accept a shoddy story for some movies, but not a thriller that's based around a mystery. It needs to make sense, but this one just doesn't.<br/><br/>But, at least it looks nice and of course, it has Liam Neeson"

","The title to this review is actually a compliment. ""The Bourne Identity"" was a great thriller with a younger cast while ""Unknown"" is a great thriller with an older cast. Both provide a good story involving a case of amnesia.<br/><br/>I will always stand by my initial reaction from two years ago when I first saw ""Taken."" I felt a bit taken or at least that my money had been taken. Liam Neeson is a fine actor, who at that time, I felt should be more of a dramatic fellow rather than an action guy. I am now taking into consideration his action scenes from ""Star Wars Episode I"" and ""The A-Team"" and feel that he can hold his own with the action movies.<br/><br/>""Unknown"" begins with Dr. Martin Harris (played by Liam Neeson) and his much younger wife, Elizabeth (played by January Jones) landing in Berlin for a conference where Martin is scheduled to give a speech. They are about to check into their hotel when Martin realizes that he forgot his briefcase. He jumps into a cab without telling his wife. On the way back to the airport to retrieve his misplaced briefcase, there is an accident where he ends up hitting his head and is in a coma for four days.<br/><br/>After Martin awakens, he finds that his wife is still attending the conference but Martin has been replaced by another man (played by Aidan Quinn). Martin (the one played by Neeson) along with audience is confused on what is happening here. He has no way to prove who he is while the imposter has all the correct paper work to prove that he is the real Dr. Harris. It becomes frustrating to be a part of this because logic tells you that the real Dr. Harris is Neeson and not Quinn.<br/><br/>The story evolves when Quinn and Neeson are unintentionally synchronizing their dialogue trying to explain who the real Dr. Harris is to another character. It's quite humorous, as it is intended to be. Through this clever story line, the audience is being drawn in closer while Neeson's character is being chased around the city by a mystery man who looks very German. I don't know if it is possible to look ""very"" German but this guy did a good job at looking the part.<br/><br/>After some running around and a car chase with Martin's (Neeson) new found co-conspirator, Gina (played by Diane Kruger), he ends up asking for assistance from an ex- East Berlin Secret Police officer (the story does take a page from the ""Blatant Coincidence Playbook"" but the audience accepts it and moves on with the story). Once the Secret Police are involved, the story goes a little deeper into why Dr. Harris was in Berlin in the first place.<br/><br/>The film finally climaxes where all is revealed on why all of this happening. Aside from a few minor plot holes (such as - why didn't Martin use the Internet more to prove who he was?) we are given the answer on why Neeson's character was ""Unknown"" and why it all makes sense.<br/><br/>Should you see this movie? Yes, it's a good European thriller that will keep you engaged throughout the entire film. There is a car chase that seems tacked on to give the audience a jolt from all of the spoken dialogue. If you liked any of the ""Bourne"" movies with their European settings and action sequences, chances are this film will entertain you."

","This movie was...what's the word?... Awful! The plot made no sense at all. Even if you are able to suspend all belief on what someone might remember or forget due to an accident, there is no way that the plot needed to be made so convoluted. In the process of trying to be clever, it only created laughable holes in the logic and continuity of the film. <br/><br/>Why go to so much trouble to try to get to the goal stated at the end of the movie when earlier, the hero(?) walked right into the the university lab and could have obtained the same information without any of the events that took up most of the movie? I guess they needed some justification for car chases, knife fights, and double-crossing bad guys. This movie was not worth the time of a talented actor like Liam Neeson. I guess he needed the money but that doesn't mean you should waste yours. Give this one a pass (even on DVD)."

","If you liked the movie ""Taken""(2008) with Liam Neeson as a former CIA operative saving his daughter in France from the mafia that kidnaps the girls and forced them into prostitution, you should like the new movie Unknown (2011) with Neeson in the title role of an American scientist, Dr. Martin Harris, who arrived with his young beautiful wife Beth (January Jones) in Berlin to give a speech on the biotechnology summit. Just minutes after arrival, Dr. Harris fell into a coma as a result of a car accident and after four days of coma awaking in a Berlin hospital, he found out that no one, including his own wife does not recognize him, and that his identity and his all life was taken by another person with the same name. If you are a fan of Neeson - the film should appeal to you. Neeson has tremendous screen presence and charisma. Looks like age is no obstacle to him. The cast also includes two beautiful actresses, January Jones and Diane Kruger. The scene between two veteran actors, Bruno Ganz and Frank Langella elevates the film above its genre. If you are a fan of the twisted thriller / mystery / action / suspense, and not just one but double or even triple twists and turns, you should not read this but run and watch the movie. :) Seriously, it is exciting, gripping and suspenseful film. It seemed predictable in the beginning but it surprised me with its revelations in the final part. I think the first film in what may become the series, ""Leam Neeson's dangerous adventures in Europe"", Taken is better because I truly rooted for Bryan/Neeson. Taken's twists and turns concerned more the identities of the ""bad guys"", and as questionable Bryan's actions were, I always wanted him to succeed and find his daughter before it was too late. Unknown is morally ambiguous. I think the title is very appropriate with the constant developments of the character as his memory of the events before his accident began coming back but the movie's got too many holes in the plot to make as convincing case for Dr. Harris as it was for Bryan Mills. <br/><br/>**********Major Spoilers. Don't read if you did not see the film. ******<br/><br/>Unknown makes you think that perhaps bumping one's head and felling into coma could actually help to clear the head in reality and to cure the very dangerous terrorists by changing their outlook completely. Unknown also suggests that no matter how carefully and thoroughly you plan the major secret operation, thinking that you predicted and backed up everything and everybody, there is always something you'd overlook or simply could not fathom. <br/><br/>*******End of Spoilers************************************************* <br/><br/>As its predecessor Taken, Unknown is enjoyable action/thrillers/mystery. Its plot may not be original -Frantic/Fugitive/Total Recall/Bourne Identity and last year's Shutter Island inevitably come to mind but good acting, Neeson's likability, fast and furious car chase and crash scenes and plenty twists and turns however implausible they are, made Unknown a lot of fun for me to watch in the theater last night. <br/><br/>In addition, the film can be recorded in the Guinness Book of Records for the number of deadly car crushes one character was involved in."

"JackCerf","2","11","22","21 February 2011"," Dull and Disappointing
","MAJOR SPOILER<br/><br/>A good ""why is this happening to me"" thriller, like North By Northwest or Frantic, is Kafka with a happy ending. A hero the audience can identify with gets caught up by mistake in a conspiracy he can't understand, but he ultimately figures it out, overcomes it, and gets his life back (along with the girl). Unknown doesn't work because the the normal life ""Martin Fletcher"" has been struggling to get back to is an illusion. He's not a guy like us or an innocent victim. He's killer scum, just one of the villains suffering from traumatic amnesia, who has become a loose end the conspiracy has to tidy up. The ""wife"" he thinks he loves is just one of the conspirators. Once we find that out, who cares about the McGuffin? Fletcher's efforts in the last third of the film to thwart the conspiracy are partly just petulance at his employer and partly the lingering effect of his delusion.<br/><br/>And there's a fundamental problem with the conspirators' diabolical plan to kill a scientist while making it look like collateral damage from the assassination of someone else. Prominent scientists in the same field may not know each other personally, but they know each other's work and reputation. ""Martin Fletcher"" couldn't just suddenly appear a year ago as the kind of professional colleague that the target victim would know and deal with.<br/><br/>Neeson does the best he can with this material. January Jones is a block of wood, and I suspect that much of her performance wound up in the trim barrel because she couldn't carry off her character's more forceful aspects. There are many egregious lapses in logic and continuity, starting with the fact that the US Embassy would have a duty officer available over the Thanksgiving weekend and ending with the seamless insertion of Diane Kruger's picture into Jones's fake Canadian passport at the end. The only redeeming feature is Bruno Ganz, and his scene with Langella is a bizarre bit of nostalgia for the supposed chivalry of Cold War spies.<br/><br/>Not even worth Netflix."

The weakest point: after it was explained to us what was really going on, I thought Neeson's character's motivation to do what he did was pretty far-fetched.<br/><br/>As for the action, is anyone else getting sick of the way fight scenes are shot nowadays? It's just one fraction-of-a-second cut on top of another: a close-up shot of someone swinging, a close-up of someone ducking, someone crashing through something, jumping off something, blah blah blah. This disconnected, quick-cut, patch-it-together-in-the- editing style looks like a sloppy way to avoid actually choreographing a fight scene, and it seems to be in almost every action movie anymore. It's even worse on the big screen. I find it nauseating and tiresome."

It's supposed to be action, but it was so laughable that it was more a comedy than anything else. Only read this after the movie. A few examples: - An assassin ""forgets"" his most important briefcase, because his ""wife"" tells him to get into the car. yeah right - He falls into a river with his valuable book, later on, no smeared ink, but a very readable book is produced. - The taxi driver, walks away, after having been in like 4C water like nearly frozen, without any police or ambulance taking care of her??? - After the MRI scan, he tries to reach the scissors in the nurses pocket, it is clear that he can't reach it, he'd somehow have to dislocate his shoulder to stretch his arm far enough, and even if he'd reach it, they would drop on the floor, because he cant curl his finger around them. - also funny, how in lots of action movies, the main characters have a car accident or lets say various, really bad ones, like the car flipping on the roof at high speed, and then they just get out and walk away... lol - The film is very predictable. When Diane Krueger wants to leave Liam, I said to my wife, she'll give back the watch. 10 seconds later... here take this its too heavy lol. - the ex spy just lets himself get killed, even though he noticed that the guy on the phone was a phoney. - Both Liam and Diane are excellent car drivers (diane is supposed to be some waitress), she even kills 3 assassins :)) - What a coincidence, the suitcase falls out of the van, just before it gets pushed of the parking lot building. and vans don't explode just because they drop a few metres lol. - And why would a scientist who has soooo important information leave his laptop to a blonde lady he has never met, no matter how charming she's supposed to be, if he has revolutionary information on his laptop. scientists are usually more interested in knowledge than in women ;) - Also the last fighting scene is pretty funny, he suddenly remembers some more things about his life before and probably fighting, but he doesn't change his technique of fighting, he just hits the other guy about 3 times harder, why did he fight like a douche before? :) <br/><br/>Those are a few of the things that come to mind, when I review this movie. There's probably some more. I have to say, I live in a German speaking country, and the German language was well inserted into the movie. Liam and Diane are likable as well as the elderly stasi guy, just a shame, they had such a bad plot to act out. As many have mentioned, its a try hard copy of the Bourne Identity, only that the Bourne trilogy is more credible."

","What makes this a weak movie is all the little and big things that didn't make a whole lot of sense.<br/><br/>1. At the beginning, the briefcase is left at the airport accidentally which makes sense if Neeson is a normal Joe, but this is his important lecture, so there's no way he'd leave it at the airport. But once we know his secret, it makes even less sense.<br/><br/>2. When he does find out that he left the briefcase, his wife is like 40 feet away, a normal person would tell his wife in person that he left the suitcase at the airport and he would go and get it. In the movie, he leaves unexpectedly and tries to call her and of course gets no cell reception -- false suspense. <br/><br/>3. At the first car chase, the taxi girl should be driving -- she knows the streets and has clocked multiple miles driving vs Neeson. Why does Neeson drive? Because he's the star. <br/><br/>4. It's Thanksgiving and a Sunday -- which is impossible. This was the rationale for not being able to contact the US Embassy and his buddy in the US. How convenient. <br/><br/>5. After all those dead bodies in the hospital, don't you think the police would believe his story about a conspiracy? You'd think Neeson would go to the police after that. <br/><br/>6. The Stasi agent seemed to give up too easily. Doesn't he have any friends he can hide out with? He knew what was coming, so he could have left. I was actually waiting for him to show the airport photo to Cole and have Cole deny that the man at the airport was Martin Harris. <br/><br/>7. Having Neeson recover the briefcase at the airport. Um, those super spies with massive resources and lots of fake ids can't recover one briefcase from an airport lost and found? The movie makers wanted this so Neeson would have access to fake ids. <br/><br/>8. After breaking multiple necks and multiple car crashes, they have to stage an accidental overdose for Neeson? WTF, just shoot him in the head and dump his body. The mission is not low profile anymore. <br/><br/>9. The head spy dies with his eyes closed to prove that he's a bad ass and resigned himself to death. Ugh. I would at least prefer that his eyes remained open. <br/><br/>10. Movie amnesia. Two knocks on the head restores lost memories. That is so wrong and so stereotypical. Not only that, but early on, he fights incompetently until he recovers his memory. His driving skills were superb though. They should take a lesson from Bourne Identity which seemed more realistic."

The car chase were really top mixed with some product placements. The action scenes have also been executed on a very high level. The cinematography seemed too much displaced and could have been better. Anyway, congratulations to all the stuff. This is another example how thrillers of nowadays should be made. I could really feel the atmosphere of Berlin and it is a nice city to visit once. 6,5/10 Don't miss TAKEN."

","...or at the least rarely watched, this faux-Hitchcockian thriller helmed by Jaume ""House of Wax"" Collet-Sera, with a script by two writers of no renown from a novel by an author of somewhat greater reputation, simply cannot transcend the weakness of its premise or the flimsiness of its characters. Act One trades on contemporary fears of identity theft, Act Two sends our hero and his gal sidekick (Diane ""Inglorious Basterds"" Kruger) in search of answers, and Act Three unleashes a trick ending that fairly well beggars the imagination as well as all credulity. Leading man Liam ""all kinds of movies"" Neeson does what he can with the material, but none of it stretches his chops, and all sorts of other name actors take their paychecks as well, with the only genuine standout being Bruno ""Downfall"" Ganz as an ex-Stasi agent conveniently brought into the nonsensical fray. All in all, it's mindless entertainment of a very pedestrian sort, and makes me think that Collet-Sera's upcoming live-action version of ""Akira"" will be a disappointment.

","Dr. Martin Harris (Neeson) goes back to the airport to retrieve his brief case while Elizabeth (Jones) his wife checks into the hotel in Berlin, Germany. On the way to the airport, he is in a car accident, leaves the hospital and goes to his wife who says she doesn't know who he is and her husband (Quinn), the other Dr. Martin Harris, is right there beside her and he can prove he is the real Dr. Martin Harris. Confused? Hey, we all were.<br/><br/>I don't think you will figure this one out. But, I will tell you one thing to help: there was a snippet of a conversation between the Martin we know and Elizabeth that may tell you what is going on ..but only somewhat  and not all. I cannot relate that snippet to you for then you would knowwell, almost know, but not all. Now, after watching the movie, I remembered that snippet and that should have told me something, but it didn't at the time. But, now that snippet makes sense. Of course, you just might stumble onto that snippet. HA! <br/><br/>Wait a minute, there were two snippets. Two. OMG.<br/><br/>I don't believe you will know ""all"" before ""all"" is revealed near the end of the movie, but anything is possible. Hey, I'm pulling for you. <br/><br/>When I did find out the truth of ""all"" it took me by surprise. I had no clue. Along with very good suspense, and tension throughout and not knowing what was going on, I'd say this was a terrific thriller. No, it is better than that, it is a terrific mystery thriller. <br/><br/>I kept thinking, like the Martin we know, as to how he can prove he is who he says he is. You may do the same. I was as lost as the Martin we know. You may be too. Like I said, there is mystery to all of this. And, isn't it about time we had a little mystery in these thrillers? Good job. No, terrific job. <br/><br/>I don't think CGI was used as the car stunts looked too real for me. They were fantastic. You think you've seen car chases? Not like this one.

","Unknown<br/><br/>""That he may discover the worlds inside love,"" a quote displayed in Unknown, insignificant to the movie just as Dr. Martin Harris (Liam Neelson) is in this film. Directed in 2011, by Jaume Collet-Serra (House of Wax, Orphan), Unknown follows the story of a Botanist, who travels to Berlin with his wife (January Jones) in order to attend a convention, though the excursion gets short-lived when Dr. Harris gets into an accident, inducing him to a Coma and wakes up to find out his identity has been stolen. Filled with unpredictable yet foreseeable events, this plot twisting thriller uses technique and symbolism known as the Dutch tilt/oblique angle and foreshadowing.<br/><br/>Even though the movie is shot in Berlin, Germany director Jaume Collet-Serra uses the Dutch tilt thrice in this film, to enhance the psychological tension in all three scenes. The first scene expresses the confusion Dr. Harris is feeling when his wife doesn't ""know"" who he is, the handling of the Dutch tilt in this scene suggests the disorientation of reality that he is facing. A subsequent scene in the film unfolds a picture that the alleged Dr. Harris presents to Liam Neelson's character, to show proof that he is the ""real"" Dr. Martin Harris. Neelson's figure views the photograph, the Dutch tilt is slightly used to add the emotional effect of shock, and lead Neelson's character to faint. The last use of the Dutch tilt comes in a scene when Dr. Harris (Neelson) is drugged by an unidentified man, when Harris escapes his confines he starts to make his approach out of the hospital. What I like most about this specific scene, is as Harris hurriedly stumbles his way to freedom, the Dutch tilt is used to show the drowsiness caused by the drugs inserted in him. <br/><br/>The technique used to emphasize psychological distortion is well used, just as exceptional as the symbolic meanings in the film. Looking carefully, most thrillers and plot twisting movies throw in a bit of symbolism to allow the audience to play around with what could happen later in the film. Whether the symbolism is the setting of season or a certain object in the film that could lead to foreshadowing. The season in Unknown is Winter, the season of death, which allows the audience to guess that a certain type of death or killing will be arising in later events. Matching the season is the white and light blue tone of color the film uses to apprehend the dull lifeless setting of the confused Dr. Harris. One aspect of foreshadowing is actually in the first ten minutes of the film, when a close-up of Dr. Harris' briefcase is shown alone in a luggage carrier, to suggest that he left his briefcase at the airport and will go back and attempt to reclaim his belonging, in which he does.<br/><br/>Captivating and mind twisting in every aspect, Unknown is an eye absorbing original thriller that everyone should witness, especially if looking for a brain twister. Liam Neelson. yet again, gives a vigorous performance leeching off of his hit movie Taken. Neelson may have a hard time trying to find his daughter and identity, but in the end it won't be hard to find this movie on DVD.<br/><br/><ul><li>Marcel Urena</li></ul><br/><br/>3.5/5"

The streets of Berlin may never have looked better, the actors in it, probably have though.<br/><br/>There might be a surprise or two hidden somewhere in the very ridiculous plot, but the cardboard cutouts (also called characters) may give you a had time caring.

The plot would stall for 30 minutes and then in literally 1 minute it would accelerate forward, without any logical explanation for the current events.<br/><br/>Also, the camera shots seemed like the camera man was having a seizure during fight scenes. The characters would begin to fight, and then the camera would shake so fast that the screen would blur, and all of the sudden the fight is over for some reason.<br/><br/>Thirdly, Liam Neeson used more Jedi mind-tricks on people than in Star Wars: Episode 1. I found that quite humorous.<br/><br/>This movie had a great idea. But failed, in every way. The actors stopped acting halfway through the movie, the camera shots were poor, and the plot was extremely extremely slow, and then someone would hit the gas, and the story would fly, and then brake again.<br/><br/>Rated a 2.

","I have read most of the reviews and agree with all the ones that rate this to be a bad movie. The plot, which has been described numerous times by reviewers, is full of holes and too unbelievable to make a good thriller out of it. My biggest pet-peeve with this film, however, is that the director/writer (and whoever else) did not consider that there are people who actually know Berlin very well. To have the taxi driver (played by Diane Kruger) pick up Neeson's character from the Adlon Hotel, which is in the center of Berlin (near the Brandenburg Gate) and drive southeast to the Oberbaum-Bridge to get to Tegel Airport (which is in the NORTHWEST - totally opposite direction), is utterly ridiculous. I guess they needed a river for the accident scene, and there are no rivers near Tegel Airport. The Oberbaum-Bridge is spectacular and the Spree river is perfect for the scene. The other big blunder is the address of Bruno Ganz' character who lives on Liebenstrasse Allee. What a joke! Anyone who speaks German (like me) knows it's either Liebenstrasse or Lieben Allee (both of which are fictitious). It's like saying John Smith lives on Broadway Street Boulevard (duh!). This movie is full of cheap thrills, like car chases and fights where the bad guys must lose. All these actors are wasted in this movie. I had high expectations for this film because the trailer looked really good. Nothing good about this Hollywood crap..."

","I am now thinking that you cannot lose when putting your hard earned cash down on a movie starring Liam Neeson! When he first started doing leads in flicks i was only used to his character work and so i unfairly labelled him. He seems to bring it every time much like Harrison Ford used to ( I often compare the two, not looks wise but just their choices are very similar when it comes to their choices in dramatic thriller scripts. Jaume Collet-Serra has the directing duties here (known for Orphan, House Of Wax) and he brings us the story of one man's plight to restore his identity amongst many obstacles. Apon arriving in Berlin Germany, Dr. Martin Harris (Neeson) and his wife Liz (January Jones) go to check into a hotel, just as they are entering the hotel, Martin acknowledges the fact that his briefcase with all his passports and various items of importance has been left behind at the airport without notifying Liz of the fact he jumps into a cab in a rush effort to return to the airport to collect it. Along the way there the cab he is in becomes involved in a accident. Dr. Harris is rushed to the hospital where he awakes 4 days later with a splitting headache but all the same he rushes out of the hospital in a bid to get back to his (who by now should be dealing in 3 degrees of hysteria) He arrives back at the hotel only to have his wife not know who he is and she is accompanied by another man Dr. Martin Harris! Will the real Dr Harris stand up seems to be the basis to this storyline as we spend the rest of the time as Liam Tries to prove he is who he is. Another flick featuring loads of plot twists and turns. I am beginning to slowly fall in love with Hollywood again"

","There's lots to love about this film....brisk tempo, exotic intrigue, fleet-footed action sequences...the best of which were displayed in many of my favorite films of this genre: the Bourne trilogy, The Fugitive, etc.<br/><br/>The Unknown is propelled forward quite effortlessly by these elements...until, surprisingly, then end. Has anyone experienced that moment in a commercial flight when the smooth, intense acceleration of lift-off and ascent subtly disengages to settle in for level flight? That's usually the point when people (those not jaded by excessive air travel, that is!) break out their books, iPads, Air Malls...the moment when the thrill is gone. I felt something of that shift watching Unknown draw to a close. The coveted ""unpredictable plot twist"" just didn't deliver me through that sling-shot feeling which so gripped me in movies that expertly employed the device in the past (I'll never forget my gaping jaw in The Sixth Sense...totally, blissfully blind-sided). I remember looking at my wife, after the big revelation (no, I won't spoil) with a look that said...""I'm not feeling it"" Could we be at that unhappy moment, ladies and gentlemen? The tipping point when unpredictable plot twists have gone through their permutations...to the point that they have simply become predictable? A very sad day, indeed, if that is the case.<br/><br/>Perhaps the new unpredictable plot twist will be....no plot twist at all."

","Neeson plays Martin Harris who is visiting Berlin for a convention. After waking up from a coma resulting from a car crash, someone else seems to have taken his identity. 'Unknown' suffers terribly from a most clumsily written screenplay and appallingly wooden acting from just about everyone in the film. The story itself is utterly ridiculous and presents itself through the use of computer generated turns of plot with a car chase here and a fist fight there exactly on queue. The fact that Harris finds an attractive young female to aid his quest to find out what is happening to him, redefines this particular movie cliché. I hope someone finds the time to reprogram the software responsible for this nonsense or to decompile it altogether."

Although I saw one professional reviewer who thought the car chases were great, my girlfriend and I thought there were too many, that they were too long, and that they were so unbelievable that it was hard to be excited by them. As a minor example of a plot flaw, how could there possibly be such long car chases in a busy major city with no police in sight. Regarding the acting, January Jones can't -- she's a wooden post.

"DTKinetic","8","7","16","19 February 2011"," More Suspense Element than Taken
","Okay, we all know we can compare this to Taken. Same actor: Liam Neeson. Near the same location: Eastern Europe. Similar plot as far as rescuing/redeeming a person/persona. Yet, there are enough differences in this movie to make the experience stand out from Taken. <br/><br/>First off, Taken is more of a ""go-get-em action/thriller"", and during that experience you were confident in Liam's ability to pummel through every obstacle that got in his way. Unknown is more of a dark suspense. It has good action, but it is scattered and mostly contains mystery, questionable phenomena, and thought-provoking circumstances as your entertainment.Here I (and probably other viewers) felt less certain about Liam's capabilities mainly because he is playing DEFENSE instead of OFFENSE, plus with the aid of the identity context itself. Liam certainly doesn't feel invincible here. There are many tense, close-call type situations that don't necessarily involve fighting and jumping onto a boat.<br/><br/>Also, the plot of Taken is almost as straightforward as it could get, finding his daughter through one witness, one trafficker one locale at a time. Don't get me wrong, Taken was fun, but as soon as Unknown really settles in, it feels as if there are three or so antagonists/enemies at the same time and therefore provokes many more questions that you want answered. I have to give credit to the use of multiple characters who were quite unpredictable, by the end when you look back to the beginning and see all that's transpired you feel like NONE of the characters were who they used to be. Last note, the photography was satisfying. Throughout the film it has a dreary/overcast/stormy type of feel that emphasizes the tension and downward motion of Liam Neeson's feelings towards his sanity. <br/><br/>With respect to Taken, overall it's a chilling, twisty, and enjoyable experience."

I had great expectations going in as I have enjoyed Liam Neeson's movies in the past and his performance here was consistent with past work. I enjoyed the acting, the plot twists, and the action but by the end I felt cheated because this film was a blatant piece of anti-capitalist political propaganda where the good people are political progressives and the bad people are in the service of large corporations which, by extension, makes the corporations evil as well (it is never clear whether the bad folks work for American corporations or for international corporations). The plot would have worked just as well if the script-writers and producers had chosen to not make it political but we all make choices that are meaningful to us.<br/><br/>There has been much discussion as to when various moviegoers have figured out the plot of this film and so I will weigh in with my experience. I figured out the plot (all except who the evil folks were behind it all because there was no basis for inferring culpability until it is stated at the end) about two-thirds or three-quarters through the movie; just before the former Stasi officer finishes fixing himself a special cup of coffee.<br/><br/>Would I recommend that someone else go see the film?

In this one Liam plays a man who awakens from a four day coma, after a freak automobile accident, and finds another man has taken his place. No one believes who he really is, including his wife. The film was directed by Jaume Collet-Serra (who also directed the popular well made horror films 'ORPHAN' and the 2005 remake of 'HOUSE OF WAX') and written by Oliver Butcher and Stephen Cornwell. It's adapted from a French novel titled 'Out of My Head'. The film is an interesting and suspenseful thriller and Liam once again makes an engaging action hero lead.<br/><br/>Neeson plays Dr. Martin Harris, who's visiting Berlin with his wife Liz (January Jones) for a biotechnology summit. As the movie opens the two arrive at their hotel when Martin realizes he forgot his briefcase at the airport. He takes a cab back to get it when the delivery truck they're following loses a refrigerator and the cab driver (Diane Kruger) drives off a bridge in order to avoid crashing into it. He survives the crash thanks to the cab driver, Gina, but falls into a coma for four days as a result of it. Upon awaking he returns to the hotel and finds another man (Aidan Quinn) is claiming to be him and even Liz goes along with the charade. Alone with no ID, money or help Martin sets out to prove his true identity and unmask the culprits as well as their motives. He finds help from a reluctant Gina and a private investigator (Bruno Ganz) but soon realizes he, as well as they, are in grave danger.<br/><br/>The film was marketed as another no holds barred 'TAKEN' type action film but this is more of a suspense thriller and doesn't have quite as much action. The action it does have is pretty spectacular though, including some amazing car chases. Neeson doesn't do as much hand to hand combat as his other popular action role but he's still quite good and a decent action presence. The supporting cast is all more than adequate and Kruger and Jones (two of my favorites) are both stunningly beautiful like always. The story is involving and very fast paced, it's pretty unbelievable at times (including a pretty far fetched twist) but for the most part it works. The directing is nicely fitting and efficiently stylized. It might not be quite as good as some fans might have been expecting as Neeson's action followup to 'TAKEN' but it's a decent action thriller all the same.<br/><br/>Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrH0mjY9QTY"

"zaisjr","8","2","3","28 February 2013"," Another thriller that keeps you on the edge of your seat!
","Unknown is one of those movies that takes you in one direction for a long time only to completely throw you off track near the end. I was worried at first because I thought this movie was a ripoff of ""Lady Vanishing"". But this film takes the mystery of the main character to another level.<br/><br/>While this movie has an interesting plot and keeps you on the edge of your seat, it isn't flawless. What keeps this movie from getting a 9 or 10 for a score is that it does have some moments that are quite unrealistic. This isn't always a big deal in thrillers like Unknown, but this movie actually has a sense of realism that is spoiled now and then.<br/><br/>What helps to carry this movie is the strong acting and resulting strong character of Ernst Jurgen (played by the great Bruno Ganz). His performance stands out and helps carry this film.<br/><br/>Unknown is a thriller with enough turns to keep you intrigued while helping you forget any of the movie's deficiencies."
"Hitchcoc","4","2","3","22 January 2013"," Way Too Much Suspension of Disbelief
","I have to admit that I'm not as critical as some when it comes to willing suspension of disbelief. I know by their natures that movies are borderline fantasy anyway. You are asked into a plot that if not contrived by the writer/director, there would be no sustainable plot. That is, we are asked to leave everyday life to engage in the exploits of a group of fictional characters. Putting that aside, the circumstances we are asked to buy into are so fragile that even the slightest mistake will bring this house of cards tumbling onto the table. I admit I was manipulated and prodded here and there, but it reached a point where I felt if they said Liam Neeson's character had disguised himself as a duck, I would have to say, ""That makes sense."" So much is based on so many tenuous circumstances that we are left stunned by the arrogance of the script. I'm sure some will buy into this if they don't think too much. That's fine, but I suspect that for most this doesn't pass muster. I like the actors in this movie. I'm sure they did the best they can, but it's the story that doesn't stand up. See this at your own risk."

Basic plot is written and directed really well, with interesting turnovers through movie and unexpected twist at the end.

Chemistry between actors work well, story is dynamic. <br/><br/>Liam Neeson is excellent, he is very balanced, trying not to step so hard, but also not to turn his acting into stereotype action heroes. Beautiful, but still so naturally looking, Diane Kruger surprised me, she was solid, but the usage of her German accent made her appearance a bit wooden to me. Other actor were also on a professional level, so I can say that I pretty liked the crew.

","A man awakens from a coma, only to discover that someone has taken on his identity and that no one, (not even his wife), believes him. With the help of a young woman, he sets out to prove who he is.<br/><br/>Liam Neeson. Aka, the man. Despite his older age, he can still kick butt in movies, especially giving us a great performance. We've seen him show his vengeance in Taken, while showing a different side in the Grey, so I thought he would give us another great performance in Unknown... The movie's premise HAS been used before, yes, fact. It sounds a little like Bourne, but something about it makes you know there's going to be a twist to set it all together. The movie's acting was good. Liam Neeson, although a great actor, doesn't seem to use body language much. He tends to talk but never shows much emotion while he does it. That is, in fact, the only complaint I can give the movie, except for the cliché plot. Everybody else did a pretty good job, and no one should be labeled a bad actor in this. I liked the director's filming style. He uses lush cinematography and good sound editing to bring it all together. Obviously the film wouldn't mean anything if there wasn't a twist. The thing about the twist is, I've heard it before. I didn't expect it BUT other movies have used this same technique on how to wrap the film up. The twist was good though, so I'm not exactly complaining. If I were to give the movie another complaint it would've been the CGI. They seemed a bit too highly editing to make it realistic BUT I give kudos to the director for at least trying. All in all, I would recommend this film. It's entertaining, fast-paced, and keeps you guessing until the end. The performances from every actor gives into the experience, and there is some badass action sequences. Although the premise has been used before, and even the twist, it's a great addition to the genre. 8/10."

","Like they say...If you enjoyed Taken, then you will enjoy this movie. The trailer left me highly intrigued to see this movie as I thought the storyline would have to include a rather good twist in order to make this movie successful. I thought it was great from start to finish and of course, Liam Neeson makes this movie. From the beginning, it gets the audience involved and then leaves them blank with so many unanswered questions in a highly interesting way, just leaving you glued to the screen to see how it all uncovers. When the movie get's started, it kind of almost leaves you confused just as much as the character which was brilliant as it really puts you in Liam Neesons' shoes. The film does indeed get the audience to ask 'What the possible twist could be?' as there is no hint or suggestion that it would be a typical solution. We follow Neeson, uncovering the answers to all the audience's questions and I must say that I was impressed with the storyline behind 'Unknown'. I thought it was very unique and was definitely directed in the best way. The script was very well written, capturing the atmosphere in the scenes perfectly. All characters were cast well and definitely had the right 'look' for their roles. Highly action packed from start to finish, Many twists and character roles leave you with an unexpected surprise which really adds the element of excitement to the film. The audience in some parts may think that they know how this story is going to play out...but more twists pop up leaving the audience highly engaged. I did think that the ending to this movie would be far fetched and typical. But no, really well done and definitely gets audience appreciation. Thumbs up, highly watchable and highly recommended."

"ghasl1","2","2","3","27 January 2012"," Don't Judge a Movie by its Actors
","First off when I found out the movie had Liam Neeson I thought it would guarantee some action and have suspenseful story like Bourne or Taken. Well just like a book I judged by the cover, the rating in IMDb and the synopsis I thought this is so cool the character is going to beat some people looking for answers to find out who he is along the way, was I mistakenly mislead.<br/><br/>First off Liam Neeson aka 'Who Am I' loses memory bumps his head against the taxi window because of a colliding refrigerator (I know sounds silly), reclaims his memory with the help of a taxi driver who just had to be a stereotypical bad female driver who drives over the bridge into the river instead of just stopping the car. Liam Neeson finds out that he was suppose to kill a scientist who can bring world hunger to an end but how does he do it he plants a bomb to wipe out the whole building and make it collateral damage just to kill this one guy who has no protection. There wouldn't be a story if he just shot the scientist and let that be the end of it, but no it has to be elaborate because..well there is no reason the movie is just bad to begin with. Anyway when he regains his memory he doesn't go through with it.<br/><br/>In short the script would of lasted few mins but was stretched out to go for over an hour. There's not much to say because its poorly made, the dialogue is bad, story unintelligent, 5 villains are not that threatening and died straight away without uttering a last word or what their intentions were. If you see this movie its like a sparkler when it fizzles out you say ""that's it?"" and you're left disappointed."
"axlrhodes","7","2","3","28 December 2011"," Highly functional thriller with a 'Frantic' feel.
","While i'd hardly leap out of my seat to see much of Jaume Collet-Serra's back catalogue (Goal II, House Of Wax remake), i have to say he has turned in a highly functional, and always engaging modern day thriller with 'Unknown'. Liam Neeson seems to now find himself at home as the '50 something' action hero, and his performance is suitably 'Frantic' which is another film that springs immediately to mind in the early stages. Neeson is supported well by an impressive cast featuring Diane Kruger,January Jones and two heavyweight actors in the shape of Bruno Ganz and Frank Langella. While you never quite feel the goosebumps brought on by 'Taken', there's still enough thrills,spills and twists to fill up the running time, and things never at any point drag."

","If one reads the story line you might think, oh, just an other story of mistaken identity. But the story develops in so much more as just that. Although it does not go very deep into the actual why, the root cause is a partial mystery and actually not that important, it does keep you interested in the movie the whole time. You simply just don't know, you might think you know, but, you won't. The characters are well played, even the extra's. With a Liam Neeson you can expect a quality character, a solid performance, a worthy main character. The car chase scenes and the violence in the movie is for the most part very believable. Accidents, and the cars are very maimed, not much in the way of Hollywood style nonsense explosions, jumping cars and stuff like that. No, believable action. The setting, Berlin, lends itself well for interesting background, we should see more of such movies set in proper European cities with style, history, substance. The actual outcome is rather surprising although the very end of the movie is not very strong. During the movie there are some moments from which you think ""they could have made more out of it, more thrillery"". However, see my score, a 9, it is still so very worth watching and I am sure that in the future I will watch it again."
"Enchorde","7","2","3","1 November 2011"," Thriller that keeps you on the edge
","A good thriller with some decent action in it. The plot is based upon a very unnerving and unpleasant idea that after waking up from a serious accident someone has taken your place. That is what happens to Martin Harris, his own wife doesn't recognize him and there is another man in his place. He has no way to prove his identity and even the family photos seem to suggest he is crazy, as the new man is in them, not Martin. Something is indeed very wrong, Martin has just no idea how wrong.<br/><br/>The idea is unnerving, but at the same time thrilling and kept me on the edge. It felt like if I missed one moment I could miss something crucial, something that could turn the entire movie around. Just how a thriller should feel. And indeed, there is a twist, quite a major one, so it pays to keep attention.<br/><br/>Liam Neeson and Diane Kruger are both very good accomplished actors and they do well, but there is no real spark between them in this movie. It just doesn't feel quite right. Unfortunately. And I had hoped the character Ernst Jürgen, the most sympathetic old Stasi agent, if there ever were one, could have played a larger role.<br/><br/>In all it is a very good thriller. But it there is some spark missing to put it among the best.<br/><br/>7/10"

","Thirty minutes into the movie and it'll be almost impossible not to start thinking about how it might end, like with most conspiracy theorists everyone will think they know the answer but most will be wrong. <br/><br/>Yes, the movie might be similar in many ways to many others because of the winter European atmosphere and the ""guy against the world"" feeling, but it keeps a good balance between the unrealistic things that you normally watch in an action movie and a plot that is both interesting and believable. <br/><br/>If you add a great leading actor and two stunning actresses to the story, it makes perfect sense that the difference between the gross and the budget is of more than 100 million dollars."

","It's Unknown how many people actually saw this good movie. Ha – sorry.<br/><br/>Let's officially begin with: I liked this movie. Sure, it's comparable to Taken, but beyond the lead star, Liam Neeson and that it's an American/international thriller, they couldn't be further apart. It's tight (under two hours,) the suspense builds all the way to the closing credits and it's beautifully shot.<br/><br/>While attending a conference in Berlin, Dr. Martin Harris (Neeson) and wifey Elizabeth (January Jones) an accident leaves Martin in a coma. When he does awake from the coma – oooh, that's not part of the suspense, but I'm glad you were on your toes – his wife doesn't recognize him. Worse, there's another Dr. Martin Harris!<br/><br/>He may be wrong himself about who he is, due to the head injury he suffered when his cab went into the water. Only the (of course, beautiful female) cab driver, Gina, (Diane Kruger) can help him rediscover his roots and why people are trying to, wait for itkill him!<br/><br/>The movie plays out on that premise and Martin has to put the pieces together, just as the audience until the finale revolutions.<br/><br/>It's not perfect, in fact, for the most part, it seems soamateurish. I'm referring to the reasons behind everyone's motivations and the number of players involved. It felt like a sophomoric project, as if the writers had completed their initial independent film and they're on their way. Perhaps, they will besome day.<br/><br/>It is very light entertainment with some good action scenes – but DO NOT let the advertisements fool you: (again) this is NOT Taken, this is NOT action-packed. In fact, despite what the movie is, I really did want his Bryan Mills (From Taken) to show his stuff and kick butt. Alas, it's not that movie."
"estebangonzalez10","5","2","3","18 June 2011"," An Unknown Liam Neeson
","¨Do you know what it feels like to become insane? It's a war between being told who you are and knowing who you are. Which do you think wins?¨ I really wanted to like this movie after watching Liam Neeson single handedly conquer Europe in Taken, and I had my hopes up for another one of his one-titled-European-action-thriller films. Unknown however is no Taken. Neeson plays kind of an opposite character this time because he spends most of the time confused and helpless while in Taken he was always smooth and in control of the situation. He was sort of a James Bond, while in Unknown he is more of a Jason Bourne, although way less gifted. This film was directed by Spanish filmmaker, Jaume Collet-Serra (Orphan and House of Wax) and at some points during so many twists and turns I think he loses the direction. I really didn't see the twists coming and thought the movie would take a completely different turn, but each time I thought the movie was going to go a certain way the film caught me by surprise again. For this I have to give the film credit, but the problem for me is that I didn't really like the path Collet decided to take. Liam Neeson is a great actor, but I enjoy him much more when he is in control of the situation. There is something about him that just exhales confidence. Unknown is based on Didier Van Cauwelaert's novel: Out of My Head, and it was adapted by relatively unknown screenwriters Oliver Butcher and Stephen Cornwell. I don't know how the story played out in the novel, but in the screenplay some of the dialogue felt a bit forced, and some situations felt unbelievable.<br/><br/>The movie opens as Dr. Martin Harris (Liam Neeson) arrives at Berlin along with his wife, Elizabeth (January Jones). He's travelled for a very important scientific conference, and plans out his schedule in Berlin while taking a taxi to the hotel. Once there he realizes that he has left a briefcase in the airport so takes a taxi back before getting a chance to tell his wife where he's heading. On the way to the airport he has an accident and the taxi ends up running off a bridge and landing in the water. Martin bumps his head and is saved by the taxi driver, Gina (Diane Kruger). He awakens from a coma after four days and is surprised his wife isn't by his side. Doctors say that he wasn't carrying any identification so that they couldn't contact any family members. The first thing he does is go back to the hotel and look for Liz, but once there he finds her with another man claiming to be Martin Harris (Aidan Quinn). Liz says she doesn't know who this man is and security officials escort him out of the hotel. Martin is still dizzy and confused, but he is sure of his identity and will stop at nothing to prove he is the real Martin Harris. He searches for Gina to see if she can help him and together they begin to work with a former East German spy named Ernst Jurgen (Bruno Ganz) who is willing to help Martin by looking at every particular detail of his situation. The movie then takes several unexpected twists.<br/><br/>Frank Langella also has a secondary role as Rodney Cole, a long time friend of Martin who could point out he is the real Martin, but who can't be located. It's always a plus to have someone like Langella in a secondary role because they can bring so much to a movie, but in this particular case he goes by unnoticed. He only serves the purpose of revealing to the audience an important twist the film will take. I thought that entire scene was totally unbelievable. I really enjoy suspenseful thrillers, but I just wasn't pleased with this one because the pace of the film was to slow and the ending just didn't pay off for me. I don't have a problem with slow films as long as the wait pays off at the ending, but in this case it didn't. I was disappointed because I really like Liam Neeson and consider him to be among the best actors in the industry, but this just wasn't the right movie for him. He was meant to play cool characters in control of their own destiny. I really missed the Neeson from Taken who destroyed entire cities in search of his daughter. In Unknown he is just lost, confused, and less scary. Unknown isn't a terrible movie, it has its moments and had me hooked for a while. It's better than Jaume's debut film House of Wax, but it's still far from being a great film.<br/><br/>http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/"
"gimili3979","4","1","1","12 April 2020"," Unknown is what the movie is
","Unknown is not your usual Liam Neeson action movie. In many ways it is not an action movie at all. A man goes to Berlin with his wife, but ends up being involved in a serious car accident that leaves him with a memory problem. Much of the film is spent with the man trying to remember.<br/><br/>Unlike the movie, Taken, where you have a simple plot with easy action, this movie tends to feel a lot longer than it is, mainly because the plot is elusive. This movie never felt like a Liam Neeson action movie, even with the action scenes. Liam Neeson plays Dr. Martin Harris. Dr. Harris gets help from a German cab driver named Gina, played by Diane Kruger. I think you know a German accent is bad when throughout the film you are constantly thinking the actress has a very bad German accent. This film tries too hard with the wrong actors playing the wrong roles. I think it is the first Liam Neeson film that I kept checking the time. Usually they fly by.<br/><br/>The movies, Taken, The Commuter, Non-Stop, are all better Liam Neeson movies because the roles are more suited to his style. This film is more of a mystery thriller and while it does have some action scenes, there are not enough to carry the film and the actors in order to make it a good movie worth seeing. Like the bad German accent, this film tries too hard to be something it is not.<br/><br/>This was the first Liam Neeson film I struggled to get through to the end. Not enough action and a convoluted plot line make this a hard film to recommend."

"ryklinker","7","1","1","16 December 2014"," Following a car accident that left him in a coma, a man awakens to find that his identity has been stolen, and no one believes that he is who he says he is
","An American couple arrives in Berlin, and they take a taxi to their hotel. The man is Martin Harris, a biologist in town to attend a summit that intends to unveil a revolutionary type of crop to end world hunger. As his wife goes to check in, Martin realizes that they have left a briefcase at the airport and decides to go back. On the cab ride to the airport, the car in front of them loses control, and the taxi swerves into the bridge wall, crashes through, and shoots out into the river. Four days later, Martin wakes up in a hospital room, and he has lost part of his memory, only aware of his name and his wife's. With no form of identification on him, and no idea where his wife is, he has no way to confirm his existence. After seeing the summit on the news, Martin remembers and goes to the hotel. He sees his wife, and as he goes to approach her, he is stopped by security. He tells the guards his name, and they say he has already come in. Martin presses past the desk and he sees a man with his wife. Furiously questioning the stranger, Martin is shown that this man has a driver's license stating the name Martin Harris, his picture with other scientists, and the wife denies any recognition of Martin. Confused and bewildered, Martin desperately searches for a way to prove his identity, and to find out why his wife denies that he is her husband. <br/><br/>The ""lost memory/who am I?"" idea is very common in the movie world, and it has become somewhat tiresome to see how much it is used. The most notable success of this concept can be found in the Bourne trilogy, and it was vastly successful in both the box office and pop culture. While this film is not nearly as good as The Bourne Identity (2001) or its sequels, it is not quite as bad as others that have appeared on the big screen. This film was made in 2011, and lead actor Liam Neeson had recently come off of a major success in 2008's Taken, a film about an ex-CIA agent who goes to save his daughter who has been kidnapped while on a trip in Europe. After the success of the film, Neeson showed that he could be an action star, and this film wanted to use that new identity (no joke intended). In comparison to Taken, this film lacks the patriarchal emotion and desire for the daughter's safety, and so it lacks the universal element that was the driving force in Taken. In addition, the acting around Neeson is not quite as good. Though January Jones and Diane Kruger do their best, Jones lacks the emotion, and Kruger lacks the likability needed for her character. Though this film is not meant to be completely realistic, there were a few times where the plot was given a little boost in order for the end result to occur. In this day and age, who doesn't have their driver's license, phone, or (when traveling abroad) passport in his or her nearest reach? Though this film didn't quite live up to my expectations, I did like it some aspects. The editing was great, the cinematography has an intriguing tint to it, and the action sequences are very good. Though his performance surely wasn't worthy of any serious critical acclaim, Neeson does a good job with his character. Lastly, this film has a twist ending. I personally love a twist when it is executed well, and though it is not nearly as good as the Usual Suspects, Fight Club, or The Sixth Sense, this film's unforeseen conclusion is pulled off reasonably well. Without the critical eye, this film is a good thriller, and it is worthy of some attention.<br/><br/>www.sportsandcelluloid,blogspot.com"

","UNKNOWN, another one of recent action star Liam Neeson's winter season offerings, is fairly entertaining, but also very implausible. Liam Neeson plays Martin Harris, a scientist who is attending a biotech conference in Berlin with his wife. Or is he? After an accident, he is left with no identification and no proof of who he is, and everyone is claiming they don't know him. He then proceeds to find out who he is. This type of mystery/thriller has been done before, although perhaps not as slickly as this one. The movie ERASED, starring Aaron Eckhart comes to mind, although that pales in comparison to this in terms of just about everything. Liam Neeson once again shows that he makes a capable, if unexpected, action star and he also has the acting chops to give it some weight. January Jones as his wife, however, is practically a non-entity. She practically sleepwalks through her limited role and doesn't really give off anything resembling human emotion, although that might have been on purpose. To accurately describe my reasoning would delve into spoiler territory, so I'll just leave it at that. Diane Kruger also gave a good performance as an immigrant taxi driver who helps out Liam Neeson's character. Aside from him, she's given the most screen time and is given a nice back story, to boot. Rounding out the cast are Bruno Ganz and Frank Langella. Although neither one of them had a lot of screen time (one might say they were underutilized), they did own the few scenes they were in. In terms of technical quality, the film was decent. There was a fair amount of hand-held camera-work, but none of it was too ""shaky"" and the fight scenes were comprehensible. There was even a couple good car chases. There was also some nice on-location shooting in Berlin, although the visual palette of the film didn't really bring out anything spectacular. Narrative-wise, the film is preposterous but still fun. There was a couple of moments where I laughed out loud due to how ridiculous things were, but overall I just accepted that the whole premise was far-fetched and went with it. Now, being mostly a dumb action movie, you wouldn't expect it to have much in the way of pertinent themes or sociopolitical commentary, but they did manage to shoehorn some in via Bruno Ganz's character, a former Stasi agent and a Saudi prince who is bankrolling a GMO project. Nothing too deep is said, but it was nice that they acknowledged that these things exist. As a whole, the movie is OK. It moves along at a good pace and is never boring. Still, discerning moviegoers would be justified in skipping it if they don't like this brand of action movie."

So, he discharges himself from the hospital and rushes over to the hotel to discover there is somebody else there who claims to be Dr Harris, and his wife has no idea who he is. Thus the adventure begins.<br/><br/>As you wander through this movie your mind is constantly trying to come to a rational explanation as to what is going on. I thought that it must involve clones or something, but that just did not sit right since it was clear that this was not a science-fiction movie, despite the movie revolving around a bio-genetics conference that Dr Harris is attending.<br/><br/>The main theme behind this movie is identity. Who are we truly, and what is it that defines who we are. It is certainly not our name, since others can have the same name as ourselves, but be vastly different. Is it a case of identity theft? Unlikely because Dr Harris' wife does not recognise him, despite him remembering their honeymoon. Is it our friends, or our occupation, that defines us? Not entirely, since Dr Harris' wife does not recognise him, and the other Dr Harris appears to be as much of an expert in the field as the protagonist does.<br/><br/>As I said, I do not want to give away too much about this movie because it is a really good thriller, and in the end everything is explained in a rational and logical manner.

Jaume Collet-Serra's thriller begins with an interesting premise: the film has a good sense of place, making intelligent use of the Berlin locations, with a fine feel for languages. Liam Neeson turns in a good performance as the central character, supported by Diane Kruger as his Bosnian sidekick, who has an unfortunate tendency to be involved in serious car-crashes. However UNKNOWN loses its way as the action unfolds. What started off as an interesting character-study soon becomes a conventional slap-bang-wallop actioner, with numerous car chases, fast cutting and implausible plotting.

The action is genuinely exciting and there are plot twists coming think and fast so that we never fully know what is going on until the end. Liam Nielson puts in a good performance as Dr Jones and Diana Kruger is good as Gina although it is Bruno Ganz who really steals the show as Jürgen.

"sergei-voivod","5","1","1","2 January 2013"," The plot twist is what kills it
","Unknown starts off as an okay suspenseful thriller that builds up the mystery throughout the majority of its length, reminding of Fincher's The Game at times. But then, out of nowhere, comes Dracula, and basically he and Neeson reenact the infamous DOOM: Repercussions Of Evil conversation:<br/><br/>Neeson: No! I must kill the demons! <br/><br/>Langella: No, John (well, Martin. Or more specifically, NOT Martin). You ARE the demons!<br/><br/>This twist is so tired, unoriginal and downright banal that it tones the whole experience down. One of the opening titles says that this movie is based on some book. Well, my guess is this book is called 'The Bourne Identity, As Retold For Schoolchildren' or something like that. It's not a bad thing, though, as the first Bourne novel was too overwritten and boring as sin, but I digress. Second thing I didn't like is that Gina, Neeson's sidekick, is mostly responsible for all the action, excluding the final showdown with 'another Martin Harris'. She is the one who murders literally ALL the assassins sent after Neeson, only leaving a bland and uninteresting guy for him to show off his re-acquired hardcore fighting skills. Now, the hotel explosion and following final fight were awesome, even with the fact that I was totally uninterested in the villain. And there came the third thing that made me yawn: Neeson and Gina get new IDs, smile at each other, and everything's fine and dandy. Why don't make him kill her instead, as she was an unwanted witness? That would be surprising, that twist wouldn't be as tired.<br/><br/>Despite these three points, Unknown is actually okay and doesn't seem like a waste of time. Neeson is above decent, that German ex-spy is plain great, and Langella is totally not bad either. The female leads are okay, too, and I actually liked J. Jones more for being such a chameleon in a dress. Overall, it's an entertaining movie, but wounded by cliché and lazy writing."

Diane Kruger's performance was flat and Liam Neeson was his usual squinty eyed man-on-a-mission. Before I was keyed in to what was actually going on, all I could think about was Sandra Bullock's 1995 movie, The Net. Since the moment I was finally clued in to what the real story was, I've been plagued by the idea that I've seen this exact story line before but I can't for the life of me remember if it was another movie, a TV show, or even a book I read once. All in all, I felt like I'd seen the whole thing before and the weak twist at the end wasn't enough.<br/><br/>Bottom line: I'd watch it if I didn't have anything else to do and it was on TV."

Langella, we are led to believe, heads a crack unit of black-ops agents who are so good their very existence has yet to be proved.<br/><br/>With that information now available, we start to backtrack to the beginning of the action and are expected to believe that these crack agents (a) forgot their briefcase at the airport, the one containing all their IDs and money (b) decided to go back and get it without telling his colleague what he was doing (and why not just PHONE the airport and have it sent to the hotel?) (c) had the foresight to have a back-up in place for their male agent, but neglected to have a back-up for the female agent (d) sent an agent to the hospital to kill one of his own in a way that would not raise suspicion i.e. injecting something into his drip - and yet the same assassin kills two hospital employees by breaking their necks, which might raise some suspicion... (e) has another of their top agents put herself in front of a bomb because of some half-cocked notion that her photo will connect her to said bomb...<br/><br/>The incongruities pile up to sink this film faster than Neeson's second taxi.

Another man has taken his identity, his wife seems to have become part of the plot or maybe she is forced to be one, a lot of people try to kill him, and whoever helps him is in mortal danger and does not survive much time on the screen. All this happens in a frozen Berlin in winter, and is filmed with a blueish filter that creates a metallic light atmosphere that just increases the anxiety. Acting is exact, Liam Neeson will not get another Oscar nomination for this role but he succeeds to make us care for him and so does Diane Kruger in the role of the woman who helps him, to find her life blown-up together with her flat in the action.<br/><br/>This is the fourth film of director Jaume Collet-Serra, whose first film, a piece of horror name House of Wax I also enjoyed. He proves here that he understands the rules of the genre and can make well-paced and efficient movies. The quality of the film comes however first of all from the quality of the script - Unknown is simply brilliantly written, the terrorism and Cold War sequels intrigue reminding Le Carre's novels provides a logical explanation which put for me every event in place in a story of lost memory and identity that could belong to the Bourne series. My preferred critics were wrong this time."
"Leofwine_draca","5","1","1","26 August 2012"," Familiar mish-mash
","UNKNOWN is one of those silly films which rehashes the same themes and plots of other, better movies in an attempt to make some money, instead of thinking up new, original concepts. At first glance, this seems to be a slightly supernatural thriller about a man being haunted by his own doppelganger, bringing to mind the Roger Moore flick THE MAN WHO HAUNTED HIMSELF. Having just watched the movie, it failed to fulfil any of my expectations and turned out to be a rather unappetising mix of three rather more recent films.<br/><br/>The film it most obviously recalls is TAKEN, the top-notch action flick which reinvented Neeson as an action star. Neeson's trapped in Europe again, fending off various bad guys, although this is far from being an action movie; the fight scenes, unlike those in TAKEN, aren't up to much. Then there are the plot twists and turns, and the whole amnesic storyline which brings THE BOURNE IDENTITY to mind. Thematically, though, I was most reminded of the excellent Roman Polanski thriller FRANTIC, which saw Harrison Ford searching for his missing wife in Paris.<br/><br/>UNKNOWN has a familiar look and feel to its storyline and few things that take place during the running time will come as a real surprise. Neeson is sleepwalking through his role, and Diane Kruger has very little to do, but both of their performances look masterful in comparison to January Jones' excruciating turn as Neeson's wife – seriously, who told this woman she could act? Aidan Quinn pops up in a minor role which makes you wonder what happened to him, and Frank Langella is in the movie even less. The excellent Bruno Ganz has pretty much the same type of mentor/support role as he did in THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE remake.<br/><br/>Despite being superficially entertaining during its running time, in the end UNKNOWN fails because of the sheer ludicrous nature of its plot. It holds the attention while you watch, but soon afterwards you sit back and realise that most of the the story is based on contrivance and coincidence. As such, it's certainly not a film you'll be in any hurry to watch a second time around."
"jturnbull-398-395794","7","1","1","3 July 2012"," Worth a look
","There are some similarities between Neeson's characters in Unknown and Taken but the plots are quite different.<br/><br/>I was taken by the sheer horror that one would feel if you lost your identity, wife, money etc. Some might say this is silly but for much of the film it works. We know something is going on but what, and why? As the movie nears its end it starts to unravel a bit and becomes transparent a little to early. The settings in Berlin are terrific, and the atmosphere suitably chilly.<br/><br/>This is a popcorn muncher but it is very well done, certainly way better than Taken. And there are no brain dead teenage girls in it.<br/><br/>Recommended."
"hg_b1","7","5","12","18 February 2011"," It's an action thriller
","We went in apprehensive because the first review gave it 1 star. First let me say that this was a good action thriller in the same way Die-hard was made. Instead of American car crashes the Germans were behind these this time and they were quite good too. The main character lands with his wife in Berlin to attend a conference and when a attaché case is forgotten, he quickly runs back to get to the airport to retrieve it. Unfortunately this is were things go wrong because a crash in his taxi makes him end up in a nearby river unconscious. When he wakes up in a hospital without identification or memory; things go array. Diane Kruger portraits a role similar to Franka Potente in the 'Bourne Identity'. She's an asset to the hero and helps him along the way of finding his identity. There are bad guys in this too and the meshing of their evil deeds with our hero trying to stay alive keeps one on the edge of the seat. We weren't bored during the film that's for sure. Several people here commented on other movies that contained similar plots yet believe me this movie can stand on its own. Like the Fugitive the main character goes through different episodes and just gets out of a dilemma in time. The film was made in Berlin and it shows nothing but a dreary city during the winter months and that certainly set the mood. If anyone believes that graffiti is an American product, they will quickly realize that Berlin is saturated with such horrible art too. I suppose all big cities suffer from this. The characters all play their roles well and that's what counts too. It's difficult writing about such a subject without giving too much away. The bottom line is that this film has not failed on sheer entertainment and that is... what it is all about. Yes, it's unrealistic yet what isn't these days when characters must navigate through ordeals and come out of them unscathed. Hey, it's not Eat, Pray..Love, okay... So I say take your popcorn (skip the butter) and enjoy a wild ride through Berlin."
"DICK STEEL","9","4","9","26 February 2011"," A Nutshell Review: Unknown
","One good turn deserves another. Liam Neeson is like fine wine and gets better with age. He's pushing 60, but that doesn't mean he cannot kick ass, which he did to perfection as an ex black ops hunting down his daughter and her abductors through the streets of Paris. In Unknown, he plays Dr Martin Harris, a researcher invited to a bio-technology congress in Berlin, only to find his identification papers missing, getting involved in a near fatal accident, and if his week has not been great, culminates in having his wife no longer recognizing him, and acknowledging another as the husband/himself instead. Talk about a major identity crisis and theft!<br/><br/>Based on the novel Out of My Head by Didier Van Cauwelaert, this Euro-thriller directed by Jaume Collet-Serra uses plenty of familiar plot elements of such mystery thrillers, but turn them completely on their heads that they are still able to provide the necessary thrills and spills complete with twists and turns that makes this one heck of an intelligent film, albeit with some minor loopholes. But don't let that detract you from what seemed like an update of The Fugitive, with the protagonist on a constant run from those who want him dead, while at the same time assembling bits and pieces of information that can be used to prove his innocence, or in this case, identity.<br/><br/>Identity theft has always fascinated, and I suppose one should be of some value, be it social stature or credit, for someone to try and impersonate you, more easily online than in person, given our connectivity these days, where photographs, websites and social media networks probably serving as that double edged sword in having our identities proved, or stolen. Neeson's Martin Harris finds to his amazement that his closest kin in a foreign land would want to pretend not to know him, and the set up for the mystery here is of course the presence of someone (Aidan Quinn) who purports to be the same person, leading one to wonder how far does the conspiracy go, and to what value and involvement is Martin Harris up against.<br/><br/>I believe Liam Neeson can probably now sleepwalk through roles like this one, with his size giving him that physical edge in fisticuffs, those deep facial lines adding that sense of intellect and gravitas, and that iconic, booming voice that just screams authority. Aiding his character is Diane Kruger as Gina the illegal immigrant part time taxi driver who had picked up Dr. Martin Harris early in the film, and found herself, her passenger and her cab plunge into a river no thanks to an accident, and being on the wrong side of things, stuck in the same conspiracy that Harris is trying to unravel.<br/><br/>For fans of the German film Downfall, or that of the well-spoofed clip of Hitler ranting in his bunker, will find Bruno Ganz no stranger. As Ernst Jurgen the one time East German military intelligence who hears of Harris' far fetched story and had piqued his interest, perhaps amongst all the scenes in the film, the one involving Ganz opposite Frank Langella is my favourite from the film, that goes to show that the elderly have enough between them to hold the film through a critical scene, hinting of danger throughout yet never necessitating big action sequences to steal everyone's thunder.<br/><br/>And credit of course goes to the director who kept the pace quick, the story tight, and containing enough action - the car chase sequence was impressively designed so kudos to the stunt team for pulling it off - to keep it engaging for an audience. Collet-Serra's filmography is very mixed at best, responsible for the horror film House of Wax, the footballing drama Goal II, and another psychological thriller Orphan, that will put this effort of his as probably the best one yet. Granted there is a huge parallel with one of the more contemporary spy thrillers in the last decade, but to mention that by name will blunt one's enjoyment at not knowing just what may pop up.<br/><br/>For fans of Taken, this is a worthy follow up, perhaps not as much action as the former, but definitely as engaging from a story perspective. Highly recommended!"
"Robert_duder","9","4","9","21 February 2011"," An absolutely amazing Popcorn flick!! Best release of the year thus far!!
","I think Liam Neeson gained a whole new following with the release of mainstream action flick Taken. Unknown is most definitely marketed and presented with Taken in mind and as good as Taken was Unknown buries it!! This is the true heart of popcorn theatre flicks. If the sole purpose of movies is to entertain this one smashes it out of the park. Unknown is the perfect blend of the Bourne films, and Taken with a great story, solid thrills, great car chases, European scenery and a terrific mystery that ties up all the loose hands with an outstanding twist at the end. For the most part I kept thinking that the solution to the mystery would be anti-climatic or leave gaping plot holes and imagine my surprise and happiness when I was wrong and the ending was fantastic! It isn't the best acting, it isn't a brilliant artsy piece but it is the most entertaining movie I have seen in 2011 and there is nothing wrong with that!! <br/><br/>One of the hardest working men in Hollywood Liam Neeson is becoming an enormous star force. He is very versatile and it turns out he is a great action star. Best of all he always seems very down to earth and makes a great underdog who always comes out swinging. Neeson is almost the same character from Taken but that's okay too because he is easy to watch and his intensity is perfect. Diane Kruger is Neeson's unwilling partner in the mystery and she is good too. They have good chemistry although it is never a romantic feeling chemistry. She has the intensity required in her role to keep up with Neeson and that's no easy task. January Jones is an old fashion Hollywood beauty but that doesn't make for a good actress. I'm not saying she's bad in her role but she certainly doesn't have the same level of quality as some of the other cast members. Her and Neeson look silly together as a couple, Neeson is bordering on being one of those old actors they always put with much younger hotter women. Maybe its Jones' character that doesn't give her a lot of depth but either way she isn't the best part of the cast. Aidan Quinn has a small but vital role that is quite good as the mystery man who takes Neeson's identity. The fight between the two of them at the end if downright excellent. Frank Langella has a very small cameo role but his presence is well received. Swiss actor Bruno Ganz is also very good in a quiet subtle role as Private Investigator Ernst Jürgen.<br/><br/>Jaume Collet-Serra seems to be a studio director and hasn't had a lot of experience to his name. However, he did direct the absolutely outstanding horror flick Orphan and now this. Normally I purposely point to the lack of experience in a film making team but this one is a big exception. Collet-Serra, and the writing team of Stephen Cornwell, and Oliver Butcher have very few credits to their name but they pull this one off flawlessly and this should do great things for their mainstream careers. Whether you love action, mystery or thriller this film should not be missed!! This is one to have in your permanent collection and will impress anyone who simply loves movies!! 9.5/10"

","(I made up the above quote by the way)<br/><br/>This is a preposterous movie and I have never seen one more-so. It is that way by design, with the sole purpose to exasperate the viewer for much of its run-time, then wipe the confusion and anger away with late reveal. And upon learning the ""twist"", the viewer is supposed to feel the relief of understanding. <br/><br/>All well and good, but if you view the film a second time, in full knowledge of the twist, you will still be shocked at the series of outrageous events and strange coincidences that drive the premise.<br/><br/>I just can't abide a movie, based nominally in the ""real world"", that requires so much suspension of disbelief. I will close this mini-review with the most minor example: Liam Neeson explains to a scientist (paraphrasing from memory), ""When I was 10 years, I told my father I wanted to be a botanist."" That is not an example of a plot hole, because it inconsequential to the plot. But it is the least plausible sentence ever uttered on film."

About half an hour into this, I realized that it was mostly a suspense thriller. It worked very well, the acting was good(expect January Jones, more details later), the suspense was there, and it unraveled at a good pace.<br/><br/>However, the closer this film came to ending, the more it fell apart. The clichés started coming in and Liam Neeson turned into Rambo. The movie built up so much suspense and most of it was wasted. Oddly enough, during the climax, the movie turned into what it was advertised as: an action film. How was the action? Meh. There's a good car chase scene and some stupid shaky-cam fighting. Liam Neeson saying cheesy one-liners also comes off as very cheesy. Next years Razzie awards should give worst actress to January Jones for her robotic performance here. Some people say ""the part needed it"" Haha... No. Even when she should show emotion, she doesn't, the Terminator showed more emotion.<br/><br/>Despite the cheesy climax, I still think the film is worth a watch. There is definitely a good thriller during the first hour."

Some parts (especially when Dr. Martin Harris finds his ""wife"" at the hotel for the first time after the accident) I thought such actors could do better. Only to realize at the end that I was too quick to judge.

","This movie was boring and unoriginal. No thrilling climax, no suspense, crappy fight and action scenes, and altogether very predictable. I would describe it as an amateur movie with a plot that has been used a hundred times before. It's more or less a movie which was made after a novel written by a first-time author who had no real ideas of their own and no experience in captivating an audience. I vote it a 2/10 for lack of originality and plot; the 2 comes from 1-Liam and 2-Diane. Good actors. That's about it. If it was anyone else, I probably would have shut it off 2/3 of the way through because I didn't care enough to watch the rest. Better luck next time."

","Unknown plays like a mix of Hitchcock, Frantic and the Bourne movies, with none of the zest or intelligence of any of those it mimics. For a while it comes off as a decent action film, with pretty dull actors and a none-too-new story. However the further it goes along the further it falls apart. In it's final act it degrades into complete madness, with a twist that drags the entire film down into pure stupidity and an event that had me laughing harder than any ""serious"" ever should. One of the more unfortunate films I've seen in recent years, with no real logic or interest to it whatsoever. As someone who got a real kick out of Taken, this was quite the surprise for Neeson's next big action thriller. It felt like he was sleepwalking through it and the whole thing felt absolutely stupid, for lack of a better word."
"Likes_Ninjas90","6","14","53","15 February 2011"," Unknown was the wrong title. This is a film about identity loss and yet it includes a checklist of familiar scenarios and set pieces from a dozen other action films
","Dr. Martin Harris (Liam Neeson) and his wife Elizabeth (January Jones) fly into Berlin as he is going to attend a biotechnology conference with a colleague. As his wife tries checking into their hotel, Martin notices that one of his bags is missing. He takes a cab to go back and retrieve the bag. The taxi enters a crash and Martin is left unconscious, only to be saved by the driver, Gina (Diane Kruger). When Martin wakes up from a coma he sets out to find his wife. He discovers her at the bio conference but she claims that she does not know him and that another man (Aidan Quinn) is married to her and is the real Martin Harris. Martin sets out to reclaim his identity by tracking down Gina, who is now working as a waitress. He also employs the help of Ernst Jürgen (Bruno Ganz), who used to be a Stasi officer in East Germany. He specialises in tracking down people and Harris uses this skill to try and contact his friend Rodney Cole (Frank Langella) back in the USA. <br/><br/>Unknown was the wrong title. This is a film about identity loss and yet it includes a checklist of familiar scenarios and set pieces from a dozen other action films. The film commences intriguingly enough, mostly because of the slick, classical direction of Jaume Collet-Serra. He's icily photographed film on location in Berlin and the omission of the shaky camera in these opening exchanges allows for smoother control. With this isolated and grey Cold War-like feel, it is hard not to be mildly drawn in by a curious, if familiar, premise. The early intensity at least makes it interesting to see how the film will unravel. Unfortunately a lot of suspense is undone by some routine dialogue of the 'that man is pretending to be me' kind and some surprisingly flat revelations. Judging from the accent of the German doctor who aids Martin, I was expecting some crazed German mind games. But there's too much Bourne here and a silly finale owes more than a little to the superior Salt from last year. The two writers credited to the screenplay were unimaginative enough to even include a digital readout bomb that needs to be disarmed. In between, there are some tired car chases and fist fights, chaotically edited, with the shaky cam and rapid cutting rearing their ugly heads. Any subtext relating to the submissive identities of migrants runs second to clichés like black four wheel drives and trained assassins. <br/><br/>Liam Neeson is an experienced and decorated performer so it's problematic that he's still in Taken-mode. With a gruff American accent and one expression on his face, glum, he lends himself to a tough but highly monotonous performance. Nearly sixty-years-old, what is Neeson's interest in choosing these action roles and bit parts? Even he cannot bring credibility to embarrassing lines like, 'I haven't forgotten how to kill you asshole'. It's Neeson's movie and yet his character is surprisingly underwritten, mostly to mask the final plot twist. More appealing support is provided by Diane Kruger (from Inglorious Basterds) and Bruno Ganz (Downfall). He has some of the best lines in the film, like when he describes his cigarette flavour as killing more Russians than Stalin and he brings some tension and ambiguity to the plot. The talents of Langella are just wasted though because he arrives very late in the film, with the sole intent of explaining the film's denouement. The film is not as primitive or as offensive as Taken, it is occasionally intense and involving, but even Dr. Martin would have trouble escaping the nostalgia."

It is ludicrous, at times incoherent, and only second in the personal hall of infamy for incredulous nonsense to the all-time worst in that category, ""2012"".<br/><br/>In 2012 you had a protagonist who could escape mere building collapses by flying through them, with the help of his wife's new husband who had no real previous flight experience. He could outrun crevices which in real-life move just under sonic speed on land, by driving on the neighbor's lawn.<br/><br/>In ""Unknown"", a film by an unknown writer and director, with big name leads, you have a supposed master spy who starts this whole mess of a movie by forgetting his super secret assassin spy briefcase. Is it irony or absurdity when a great actor in Frank Langella deadpans to Liam Neeson, ""you were my best agent"". I guess that doubt would enter anyone's mind if they left top secret plans in a briefcase you wouldn't forget, if you were a super spy assassin, in the cart at the airport.<br/><br/>It only gets worse from there.<br/><br/>When is the next Jason Bourne movie? That is fiction which plays out as realistic. ""Unknown"" is pure wait for cable tripe."
"Osteoperosis","1","5","15","26 February 2011"," Not bad, but disappointing
","OK, before you get mad because I gave it a 1, let me explain. This movie is decent. It is exciting in parts, the story is almost intriguing, Liam Neeson is the man, and I at least had a good time, but for me there wasn't enough incentive to spend $8 and I honestly wish I had waited for the Netflix release.<br/><br/>I heard this movie compared to Taken multiple times but let me assure anyone who is trying to decide... this is not nearly as good as Taken. Taken didn't try to be something it wasn't. It had a very clear and simple plot used very efficiently to make one intense and unrelenting action scene after the next.<br/><br/>Unknown is not that movie. It tries to be suspenseful, dramatic, thrilling, and intriguing but leaves much to be desired. Its hard to explain without specifics but the main problem I had is that the story touched on so many character development possibilities but basically does nothing with them. A few very important character transitions happen without even a discussion as to why. When the twist finally showed up I thought it was interesting but it didn't change anything for Liam's character. It was like there were 3 or 4 scenes in the original movie where the character had to deal with a ""love interest"" problem, an ""identity"" problem, and a final ""declaration of purpose"" but they decided to cut them out to get to the end quicker. It just kind of rolls on while leaving out the character's real struggles in order to finish the story. And honestly, it may be because I wasn't very attached to the characters, but the twist was a little silly. You may have a different opinion but that's just how I felt about it. Liam Neeson did a great job as always, Diane Kruger was probably the most interesting character (but again with many possibilities left unexplored) but she did a fantastic job... and she's really hot.<br/><br/>Now don't think I can't appreciate a simple movie. I love Micheal Bay films. He keeps his character development to an absolute minimum, just enough to keep the audience interested between explosions. What disappointed me about this movie is it seemed to really want to be intriguing, intelligent, and thought-provoking but falls short of the mark. <br/><br/>Overall, the best assessment I can give is that the movie was extremely mediocre but could have been great. The reason I gave it a 1 is not because I'm mad at the movie but because when I looked up the reviews it had a 7.9 which is VERY misleading. This is a solid 6."

While oversees, Harris is involved in a traffic accident and gets banged around a bit. When he comes to, his memory is a bit scrambled and his entire identity is seemingly stolen.<br/><br/>To put it bluntly, this film is bad in pretty much every aspect, but three really stand out:<br/><br/>First off, Hollywood suckers us in by capitalizing on Neeson's ""Taken"" persona, only this time throwing in January Jones (of Mad Men fame) as eye candy. No new character ground is trod whatsoever.<br/><br/>Second, the plot is almost a carbon-copy of the Jason Bourne series, only much less intriguing and reeking again of capitalizing on an already-done idea.<br/><br/>Finally, and this is the truly sad part, this movie actually has a decent mystery revealed towards the end. However, the rest of the movie is so drab that you won't care about the ""big reveal"" when it does arrive.<br/><br/>Basically, here is how I look at ""Unknown"": It tries to channel ""Taken"", instead rips off ""Bourne"", and ends up far too close to the dismal ""Edge of Darkness"".

","Woa. I'm worried about the people who think this was a well-scripted, -acted or -directed feature, or who found the action scenes in any way convincing. Wrong! This flick is a DUD! Just about passable for those brain-dead evenings when you can't converse yet aren't ready for sleep, killing time between long-haul flights in airport hotels, or creating mood lighting if all your lamps happen to be broken.<br/><br/>You definitely don't need to think too hard or try to follow the plot or anything like that because there's precious little rhyme or reason to this ridiculous goose chase! So feel free to fall asleep whenever you get bored, rewind or fast forward and watch the film from random points... heck, you can even switch language settings and view it in Dutch. (Or if you are in fact Dutch then try to pick a language you don't know, like Mandarin.) It really doesn't matter and the movie won't make any more or less sense either way. This is a stoopid film that fails spectacularly at trying to build tension in the way of the Bourne Trilogy or about a million other movies that work the ""did I just hit my head or am I an elite trained assassin?"" genre. But unlike either the Bourne films or Memento, another film that successfully toys with the conundrum of memory and identity, this movie - the title of which I've already deliberately forgotten - never, ever, ever, makes the viewer curious or hungry to solve the riddle.<br/><br/>It's just boring and dumb and despite the stellar-sounding cast, the performances are mostly atrociously stilted. A surprisingly convincing Diane Kruger wipes the floor with the rest of the cast. But before we start polishing statuettes: it's not hard to look like a great actress when you're acting opposite a Liam Neeson who displays all the emotional range of a Thunderbirds puppet in the role of a supposedly distraught hit-target in a foreign land. The scene in the art museum with his ""wife"" is jaw-droppingly devoid of any believable emotions, even once you take the double-crossing storyline into consideration. When you consider Neeson's recent personal tragedy in real life, regarding the untimely death of his wife, it seems perverse that he chose this role and even stranger that he gave it such a wooden delivery. The truly uninspired script is only partly to blame.<br/><br/>There are so many holes in the lazy excuse for a plot that it's not even worth dignifying it by puzzling over them. But purely for amusement's sake, and just in case you do find yourself at some airport Hilton with 2 hours to murder, here are a couple of questions you might enjoy pondering while half-watching this tripe: who does anyone work for and what are their goals?; how does a guy with no ID or bank card, who's lost all his luggage in a foreign country have limitless and mysterious access to large wads of cash on demand and a mobile phone whenever he needs one? <br/><br/>This film has no suspense, no sexual chemistry, unexciting and over-choreographed car chases, and unintentionally hilarious dialogue: would a high-ranking diplomat's wife really offer a Saudi prince a martini as soon as he entered the room? <br/><br/>It also has weird casting in the supporting roles. I swear the Sheikh is one of the Wayans brothers in a Halloween costume while Frank Langella is more undead than when he played Dracula all those years ago. January Jones is as artificial and unbelievable as her tampon-brand sounding name: a wind-up Barbie doll. Even once you get that she's SUPPOSED to be a soulless automaton, it's still hard to forgive a performance that would have seemed amateurish in a high school play. Meanwhile Sebastian Koch, so excellent in ""The Lives of Others"", wanders around this set with an anxious look on his face that seems to say 'I hope the cheque clears.' The director is so bad I'm gonna do him a favour and not even mention his name, simultaneously sparing me the effort of going to look it up. Best forgotten.<br/><br/>However, I gave the movie a 5 and not a 0 for this reason: should you be at all interested in a career in film and/or film criticism, this film (oh yeah, I just remembered the title, ""Unknown"" - how apt) makes an excellent study into that hard-to-define territory of when something just isn't working.<br/><br/>So many times during this movie I found myself thinking stuff like: ""why..?.what is it about this chase scene that's so terrible and wrong...plenty of chase scenes are improbable so it's not just that....what is it about this bit of dialogue here that seems so cheezy and fake..?.lots of movie characters say things they wouldn't say in real life..why is it bothering me that we're supposed to buy Diane Kruger being hot for Liam Neeson..? .plenty of grey goats get down with fresh fillies in popular films..."" <br/><br/>And on that note, let me conclude thusly: <br/><br/>if you find yourself a-hankerin' for a film about an almost-over-the-hill-but-still-kinda-handsome American guy being rescued from vague dangers and a boring medical conference in a European capital by a sexy girl with a cute accent roughly his daughter's age, with whom he then runs through various underworld and club settings whilst evading the baddies, then I suggest skipping ""Unknown"" and instead watching Roman Polanski's ""Frantic"" from 1988, starring Harrison Ford as the Liam Neeson character and Emanuelle Seigneur as Diane Kruger.<br/><br/>To be honest, that's not a very good film either. But it's a whole helluva lot more substantial than this lint."

","Neeson as always, gives us a good performance - supporting characters are average to good with some thugs being B film quality. The photography is pretty bad, dark places designed to give you a feeling of suffocation or claustrophobia, blurred action designed to give you a feel of movement but all combines for just poor cinematography (imo) Gets draggy and boring in the earlier stages of the film but the action picks up midway with some scenes being longer than needed to make a point. Chases and fights too long but good action otherwise.<br/><br/>Good mystery line that I thought could have been played on much much better with better screen writing but overall, a good way to kill a few hours if you have absolutely nothing better to do - certainly not a waste of time if you've already watched everything else on your ""need to see"" list.

It's to be judged on the basis of how wild the ride is that gets you to the finish, and by that standard this movie works pretty well. There's a lot of mystery, pretty much right off the top, there are people getting killed all over the place and there are two pretty wild car chases through the streets of Berlin. When you add to that a pretty solid cast led by Liam Neeson, you end up with a pretty good and exciting story - a fantasy, certainly, but suspenseful and mysterious, which is what the movie was intended to be.<br/><br/>Neeson heads the cast as Dr. Martin Harris, a botanist in Berlin to attend a Conference at which a new strain of corn is to be revealed - one that's resistant to drought and other natural blights and that will help end the world food shortage. But things go wrong from the beginning. He gets into a car accident, ends up in a coma, and when he wakes up no one - not even his wife (played by an actress named January Jones) - remembers who he is, or believes he's Dr. Martin Harris - and in fact there's another Dr. Martin Harris who's taken his place who everyone accepts as THE Dr. Martin Harris. The mystery around his identity takes a lot of twists and turns and keeps the viewer guessing until the mystery is revealed, ultimately leading up to the climax of the movie: a foiled assassination attempt.<br/><br/>It's a decent movie; a fun movie to watch. It's not to be taken too seriously. It's to be looked at for its entertainment value in the action/suspense genre. From that perspective, it holds up pretty well. (7/10)"

","The one thing successful starring actors have in common is their ability to turn down project they don't have to do and pick the ones they instinctively know will satisfy them on an artistic level. This is not something I'm making up; James Lipton, host of 'Inside The Actors Studio', usually asks that to his guests in one way or another. The answers most often replied are along the lines of this review's first sentence. Liam Neeson is one of those actors who knows how to pick' em. Just glance at his filmography; it speaks volume. I decided to watch this movie solely on the basis of him having a starring role; I have not yet been disappointed by any of the projects he's been a part of.<br/><br/>Furthermore, Neeson varies his roles. Carl Anderson, the deaf-mute accused man in ""Suspect"", Peyton Westlake /Darkman in ""Darkman"", Oskar Schindler in ""Schindler's List"", Dr. Jerome Lovell in ""Nell"", Valjean in ""Les Misérables"", Alfred Kinsey in ""Kinsey"", Carver in ""Seraphin Falls"", Hannibal Smith in ""The A-Team"" and Bryan Mills in ""Taken"", to name just a few of the diverse characters he's played in his 84 movies (in 32 years).<br/><br/>I enjoyed the movie because it was a thriller like thrillers ought to be; the pace is sometimes fast, sometimes slower with a new twist as the changes in pace occur. Anyone who claims the story is predictable, speaks of a different movie and has sniffed too much crazy glue. Key to a good thriller like this one is that you think the hero is screwed but he's not; twenty minutes later, he's screwed again, but he's not. Then, when you think he's about to get himself unscrewed one more time, he falls deeper into trouble; oh yeah he's fu##d for sure this time You get my point.<br/><br/>The movie also has a supporting cast that would make any lead proud; a star shines more brightly with the likes of Diane Kruger, Aidan Quinn and Frank Langella. The director's previous project is one that I watched on a movie channel in recent months; I had not bothered to look up who it was but I think I'll remember Jaume Collet-Serra from now on."

","i recently watched source code, limitless, and unknown which i will make a review for each of them. all these movies have something in common i feel the directors try to rush they don't take enough time to explain the complicated concepts and events in which is crucial to understand the movies, they also do not shed enough light on key role characters, in addition the dialog is often vague in which the viewer is not clear on whats happening, in a nutshell the storytelling in all three movies is plain CRAPPY (Unknown not so much), i cant help but feel that most directors are attempting to imitate Christopher Nolan style which i despise (making fairly complicating ideas into hugely complicated through his very bad direction and storytelling and even dialog. in limitless and source code specifically very little information is provided keeping the viewer thinking in order to fill the illogical gaping holes in the technicality of the story and the complicated events revolving around the main character leaving the viewer thinking logically of what or why just happened instead of just enjoying the moment. and this what i don't recognize in older movies i don't feel the movie is an outline or a summary of a longer movie, and i don't feel the compression of the development of incidences during the movie.<br/><br/>---Unknown--- as i gave it a good rating because the negative points never really ruined the experience for me as most movies do, my negative point is the director did not shed enough light and developing the secondary characters, i am talking mainly about Rodney Cole, the part where the German x-spy killed himself and the dealogue between them is not fully explained, and i just feel this part doesn't fit perfectly in the movie, they just put it to add some time and event. i specifically feel that those small important details are crammed in a way which it makes the movie less understandable. like how did the x-spy know martins real past when he said ""what if he remembers everything?"".i cant help but feel this movie is just scene after scene after scene not really interconnected with each other, this may be the most efficient way to shoot a movie but makes the movie less valuable than it potentially is, movies nowadays don't have this heaviness/richness that the good old ones had. and how did the martin Harris-es know the password (i mean the number code itself) to Bressler's work? and what operating system in the world are the using it seems its all the same software in all the movies, id die to use that instead of windows ;)"

How the main character remember passwords, numbers,, details but can not remember anything else about his past like his address in America for proving who really he is? 3. We live in society! We have many ways to prove who really we are! Why the main character does not visit the embassy? Usually this is the first place we go in troubles on board!

"whistlerspa","6","2","4","6 June 2011"," A mixed bag but entertaining
","Liam Neeson plays well ... Liam Neeson most of the time in his films and is always this tortured character wrestling with inner turmoils of one sort or another. I saw echoes of past work like Taken, Afterlife and even Love Actually creeping into his portrayal here. That may be a little unfair as he has played some great roles over the years but he did seem to be a little on auto-pilot for most of this one.<br/><br/>That being said I enjoyed the film, and I can always watch Diane Kruger, who is usually worthy in anything she's in (I forgive the terrible Eastern European accent is it?). As Neeson's leading lady in this film the chemistry didn't seem quite right though, and they seemed awkward in their scenes together unfortunately.<br/><br/>The story is initially intriguing and puzzling and keeps you guessing. A doctor and his wife arrive for a conference in Berlin - where he is due to speak at a Biotechnology conference. He leaves his briefcase at the airport and rushes back for it leaving his wife at the hotel. The taxi he's in, driven by Kruger, has an accident and he's comatose after she saves his life. When he wakes up he finds that another man (Aidan Quinn) has stolen his identity and his wife appears to be going along with it. What is going on and why? He tracks Kruger down and enlists her help to find the answers. Bruno Ganz is also roped in as an ex KGB spy now turned PI, and he embarrassingly overacts in his part.<br/><br/>About half way through I began to have suspicions regarding Neeson's character whose actions contradicted his apparent persona and this meant that I worked out the twist ending fairly comfortably with time to spare.<br/><br/>The hoods were suitably sinister but easily disposable, and seemed to wait for their fates however in the action scenes. Quinn (who worked well with Neeson in Michael Collins) was largely wasted in this though with way to little to do. I would have liked to have seen his part larger.<br/><br/>However as said this film entertained and was worth the watch in my opinion."

Because it kept me guessing until just the same spot that ""Total Recall"" did. When he finds out that he's not really who he thinks he is, you pretty much know where it's going to go from there.

","I thought this movie would have a big 'twist' but having seen the whole Bourne trilogy plus the original Bourne Identity, as well as Nowhere Man, this movie seemed incredibly derivative. It's pretty much just a big long chase, with a little twist which you totally see coming if you've seen anything along this line before, and maybe even if you haven't. Lots and lots of long drawn out car chasing. Villains always on their heels. Lots of fighting. It also kind of reminded me of another movie of Leeson - i.e., Taken, which is also one big long chase. So between the plot being so derivative, and the similarities with Taken, this just didn't have much new or interesting for me. Also, while the lost/stolen identity plot worked well in earlier works along these lines, it really seemed out of touch with current information technology, which made it even easier to figure out the 'twist' than it would otherwise have been."

When walking into the theater to watch this movie, I was at least hoping a movie that is in the level of Liam Neeson's past movie ""Taken"". Since the trailer to this movie looked sort of similar and all and even the main character seemed a bit similar. But it did not meet my expectation, and the friend I dragged to see the movie was constantly moving in his chair, checking his phone and taking a deep breath a few times. What I wanted was a simple action movie that has enough flare to be worth seeing in theaters. If it was paced a bit faster and had a bit more better action sequences and connected better and quicker, it might have not been as boring. But the thing is this movie is dull in a lot of parts, it wants to intrigue the audience with the mystery of what is really going on but it just doesn't really work all that well. The movie tries to focus more on the plot and mystery but it's all so darn dull most of the time and didn't really care what happened. The execution isn't even all that clever and relies way to much on amnesia in a very stupid manner, you will see when you watch the movie. Overall, it's a pretty disappointing movie.

","There's not a lot one can say about this without giving away the plot surprises. It started out reminding me of other Hitchcock 'hommages' like FRANTIC or Liam Neeson's own TAKEN. The fact that Neeson's character here loses his memory in a near-drowning inevitably recalls THE BOURNE IDENTITY, and the parallels with the Bourne movies were soon coming thick and fast: urban car chases (good stunt work or CGI?), the girl (Diane Kruger) who saves our hero more than once, the treacherous people supposedly on Neeson's side. And Neeson's character develops along similar lines to Jason B.<br/><br/>This is one of those films that you find yourself picking holes in as soon as you're out of the cinema. ""Why didn't he/she do/say that?"" The answer tends to be: ""Because the movie would have only lasted 10/20/30 minutes."" So: pacey and twisting, yes. But also, contrived and derivative. Entertaining enough while you're watching it, but really no more ""meat content"" than a Jean-Claude Van Damme vehicle. Not in the same class as the Bourne Trilogy: Matt Damon retains his title."

","The lessons I learned after watching this movie - one: never leave your briefcase at the airport. Two: Mercedes-Benz makes damn sturdy taxis. Three: Liam Neeson continues to be a badass even when he's nearly 60.<br/><br/>""Unknown"" is mostly a mystery thriller - Liam Neeson's character awakens from his coma after an accident to find out that someone else has taken his identity - and nobody believes him. The plot weaves through the streets of Berlin and some shady characters - with the all too typical thriller lesson of not trusting anyone.<br/><br/>The film is briskly paced, there are slow moments but every 10 minutes there's an action sequence liven up the film, and it's especially during the last half of the film that the action sequences pile up after another. The action is fast and brutal for a PG-13 movie, and is shot quite clearly without annoying shaky camera for the most part, especially during the car chase scenes, while the fluid editing completes the job by adequately pacing the film to be fast or slow if necessary.<br/><br/>And then there's Neeson. Here he is surrounded by both old and new familiar faces. There's Aidan Quinn and Frank Langella as the people with mysterious vibes, and then there's Diane Kruger and January Jones as the lovely-looking ladies but yet there's something not quite right about both of them. German actors Bruno Ganz (""Downfall"") and Sebastian Koch (""The Lives of Others"") round out the impressive supporting cast, with Ganz commanding the screen every time he appears. But it is Neeson, his age becoming more visible as the years pass, still giving a high- energy and determined performance that becomes the heart of the film and thus cements him as an (late-blooming) action hero/star of this generation. He is believable in the fight scenes, and his humble charisma gets the audience firmly on his side.<br/><br/>And yet this film has its ups and downs. On the positive note, Jaume Collet-Serra's direction keeps the actors focused and the action intense, with the cinematography of Berlin showing both its glamorous and gritty side, what with its blueish hue and whatnot. John Ottman and Alexander Rudd provide a tense music score to the action. On the negative side, some parts had me suspending my disbelief in certain scenes. There is a twist at the end of the movie which I admit did not really see coming, but it wasn't exactly original as I've seen this plot device done in another movie before.<br/><br/>But overall, it's a very solid thriller. It gripped my attention from start to finish, and it kept me guessing on many occasions. It too, made me think a bit about the bad guys - how smart and terrifying their methods are to get what they want at the expense of other innocents. Will this win any Oscars, no. Will Liam Neeson fans love it, I guess so. Will this entertain, definitely. I wouldn't mind watching this again if I had the time and company.<br/><br/>P.S. This would make a great advert for Mercedes Benz cabs in Germany.<br/><br/>Overall value: 66/100"
"ced_yuen","Null","2","4","10 March 2011"," Completely different to Taken
","Since 'Unknown' was announced, the internet has been abuzz with talk of it being another 'Taken', a film responsible for re-branding Liam Neeson as an action-man of sorts. And why not? 'Taken' received a lot of positivity for its high-octane, no-bullshit action and gained Neeson a whole new following, begging for more.<br/><br/>Comparisons are inevitable, considering the way that 'Unknown' has been marketed. Trailers show Neeson once again in a predicament, rampaging his way through another European city. The marketing team might as well have made posters for Taken 2 given the (intentional) lack of originality. The problem is, 'Unknown' is not that film. With the exception of a few surface similarities, the two films are entirely different.<br/><br/>During a visit to Berlin, Dr. Martin Harris (Neeson) has a traffic accident that puts him in a coma. When he returns to normal life, nobody believes he is who he is. His wife (January Jones) doesn't recognise him, and to make things worse, another man has taken his place, doing his work and living his life. With the help of an illegal immigrant (Diane Kruger), he sets out to reclaim his identity.<br/><br/>'Unknown' has much more in common with the mystery thrillers of the '60s than it does with the action-heavy 'Taken'. Characters stumble from one incident to another and the emphasis is on the mood rather than on the adrenaline. The occasional bit of violence and the one car chase do not drive the story, but add to it. While Neeson played a lethal predator in 'Taken', as Martin Harris he is a normal man, disturbed and puzzled by his predicament as anyone would be. As a result, his character feels much more vulnerable, which allows a much more realistic sense of threat.<br/><br/>The first half of the film capitalises on this. As Harris' world is turned upside-down, it is uncertain whether he is brain-damaged from his accident, or if there really is a conspiracy against him. Does hearing footsteps behind you mean that you're being followed? When those footsteps quicken, does it mean that you're being chased, or is it just somebody trying to catch a train? Director Jaume Collet-Serra creates a real sense of persecution and does a great job of blurring the line between paranoia and reality.<br/><br/>The rest of the film is less remarkable. The writing gets a little too imaginative for the serious tone established, and stretches plausibility almost to breaking point. The questions asked in the first half of the film are answered with too much exposition, and loose ends are tied up too hastily. What started off with a huge amount of potential ends up as a by-the-numbers mix of thriller clichés. These things don't derail the movie, but it certainly is a pity.<br/><br/>Liam Neeson is as watchable as always, and despite playing tough guys in 'Taken' and 'The A- Team' he plays the victim here without any problems. Diane Kruger, forever playing supporting characters, gets more to do here, which is a good thing. January Jones and Frank Langella, however, are wasted in limited roles with little screen time.<br/><br/>'Unknown' certainly has problems, but they don't make the film any less enjoyable. Its interesting premise and its mostly-capable execution keep it just above the average popcorn fodder. There are plot-holes you need to ignore, and you probably won't remember much of it afterwards, but it will entertain you while it lasts."

The rich professor must be helped by a poor illegal immigrant girl and the bad boys seem always to be perfectly organized and chase the haunted without pity. The usual car chases and execution scenes underline the lack of originality of the movie. The only thing that distinguishes this movie from many others is the fact that it takes place in Berlin and that many well known and promising German actors got a few roles in this movie and take their chances to convince a larger public. As I happen to be from Germany, I found it interesting to see such a polished psycho thriller take place at famous and infamous locations of the German capital and the movie gives a very little glimpse at the culture of this city by showing its beautiful and ugly sides. This movie creates a certain wanders lust to go and discover the city and makes a good publicity for the country.<br/><br/>After all, once you accepted the weak and ripped off story, you really get well entertained and see a solid acting and nice shooting places.

He was at that time outside at the main entrance of the hotel, looking for the missing suitcase. Why didn't he ask to see also the observing cameras of the entrance with the cars? I cannot imagine that there are no cameras outside the main entrance. For me. if there are such unlogic things happening at the beginning of a movie, that's a no go to continue, just wasted time."

","Unknown stars (Liam Neeson) who after the success of Taken one and two started appearing in more action movies and even in a couple of fantasy action movies like Clash of the Titans but most of Neeson's roles after Taken would end up being him playing a character very similar to his character in Taken a quiet, brooding, secret agent type character that he's now pretty much type casted as and over the years he has stared in multiple movies that have tried to recapture his performance in Taken and sadly these movies are nowhere near as good.<br/><br/>Unknowns story is simular to the movie (The Bourne Identity) A man gets into an accident and forgets who he is and what happened to him the only difference in this movie is that Neeson's character thinks he knows who he is but discovers that another man has taken his identity, his wife, and is living his life even his wife doesn't recognise him so he sets out to find out what happened to him in the car accident and tries to prove he is the man he claims to be and that the other man claiming to be him is an imposter he meets a woman along the way who helps him they evade assassin's while trying to discover his real identity while different in some aspects this movie is pretty much just The Bourne Identity with Liam Neeson instead of Matt Damon it's very predictable and unoriginal.<br/><br/>The first fifty minutes of the movie are very slow repeating the same situation over and over of Neeson's character trying to convince people he is who he says he is and when the movie finally does get into some action it's very boring and isn't worth the build up to it at all.<br/><br/>This isn't a bad movie by any means but it's your standard copy and paste Action/Thriller with your standard Liam Neeson performance the story is interesting enough I guess but it's like the movie The Sixth Sense in the way that once you know the twist the whole movie becomes forgettable and pointless watching again because there's nothing to build up to anymore.<br/><br/>I recommend watching this movie if your a fan of Liam Neeson's acting and you enjoyed the Taken movies but just don't expect anything special or even memorable it's just a two hour time waster that will end up sitting on your DVD shelf for years because you forgot you even own it."

","Another one in the collection of Liam Neeson movies that many would fail to distinguish, but yet, would still watch every single one of them again if they can, since all of his movies are action packed and fun to watch. This one also has a pretty good plot that evolves in ways you would not expect, plus the action takes place in Europe, which makes it even more fun. An interesting ending to say the least, lefting us craving for more Neeson action in his next movie."

"filipemanuelneto","7","0","0","23 May 2020"," It entertains and even surprises, but it has some difficult flaws.
","Personally, I liked this movie. It starts well, with an American academic who arrives in Berlin with his wife, and everything seems fine until an accident happens. When he wakes up in the hospital, he finds that no one knows who he is and he has no documents. Worse: someone is using his identity and living his life out there.<br/><br/>The script has good premises and I felt that it fulfils what it promises. The film is full of suspense and good action scenes and will certainly satisfy those who came in search of an intense thriller with few dead moments. In between, there are several twists and turns that help to keep our interest and to maintain the film rolling. The most complicated will be to consider the story credible enough, but if the audience is willing to give the film a chance by forgetting this difficult point, the film can make up for it.<br/><br/>The cast does a good job. Liam Neeson is good and does an excellent job, but the fact is that he is making a kind of character in which he feels comfortable, so he does not surprise us. Diane Kruger is the most striking female character with a particularly good performance. Bruno Ganz, in his first work that I saw after ""Downfall"", is very good at and adds a lot of quality to the film. On the other hand, Frank Langhella is good but has little screen time, January Jones does nothing special and Aidan Quinn is uninteresting. The interaction between actors is uneven and some dialogues sound theatrical.<br/><br/>Technically, the film is quite solid. It has a good cinematography and was very well filmed, using the light and shadow to intensify the suspense and create atmosphere. Expertly directed by Jaume Collet-Serra, it has well-done action scenes, very decent special, visual and sound effects and a post-production work that was generally well done. Not being free of flaws or minor problems, I think its a film that delivers what it promises and can really entertain the audience."

Of these, Spellbound is of course the best (because Hitchcock), but Mirage is my favorite. This move is fairly obviously a reimagining of Mirage, so much so that I was surprised not to see it credited.<br/><br/>The movie works well and is very watchable, though just a hair worse in every way than the earlier movie. For example, Liam Neeson and Diane Kruger are great as the two main characters, but Gregory Peck and Diane Baker were better. Bruno Ganz is wonderful Ernst Jürgen, but the private detective role was played by the inimitable Walter Matthau in the original. And baddie Olivier Schneider in this movie is practically forgettable, while Jack Weston, usually a comic actor, was full of screen-grabbing menace whenever he appeared in Mirage.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen Mirage, see that one first or instead, unless modern effects are more important to you than first-rate directing, screenwriting, and acting. If you *have* seen Mirage, and enjoyed it, then you'll like this one too. The plot is just enough different that it won't be *completely* predictable."

","I've been loving the rise of Liam Neeson the Action star & he's made some really excellent films like the Taken Trilogy & Non-stop & A walk among the Tombstones & Run all Night & The Grey & Unknown, he's become an aging action legend in his own right.
Neeson gives another solid performance here as a man with a lost memory stuck in a wintery Berlin trying to find out why his wife is saying she doesn't know him after he turns up a few days later with no memory except of her & his own name & has to piece together what the hell is going on?
Unknown is a Classy Mystery Thriller that's filmed in a grim & sickly green that makes everything feel off & looks very grimy & urban gritty, also the dead of winter & snowy setting of Berlin add a cold icey atmosphere to this Clever Mystery that is expertly Directed by Jaume Collet-Serra, who also directed Liam Neeson in other excellent Thrillers Non-Stop, Run All Night & The Commuter, so he's a top suspenseful Director who brings out the best Thriller performance from the ageing rugged Neeson, abit of a dream team.
Apart from the good cinematography & tone of this movie it's also got a nice suspense-driven music score & a good little supporting cast with January Jones, Diane Kruger, Aidan Quinn & Frank Langella.
If you enjoy a good solid & exciting Mystery Thriller & like a good Neeson film than Unknown is definitely gonna satisfy.
I love Thriller's & love Neeson flicks so i totally enjoyed this entertaining Thriller that could've easily of been made in the 1990's as a slick Thriller with someone like Michael Douglas for example & that's kinda comforting that this type of straight forward action Thriller is still getting made in these over-blown mega-budget & c.g.i obsessed days of movies.
Unknown is a fun, Mystery popcorn Thriller that's perfect for a Saturday night."

","Directed by Jaume Collet-Serra. Starring Liam Neeson, Diane Kruger, Bruno Ganz, January Jones, Frank Langella, Aidan Quinn, Rainer Bock, Sebastian Koch, Karl Markovics. (PG-13)<br/><br/>Neeson travels to Germany with his wife (a wooden Jones) and ends up in a coma after a car crash, but after waking up a few days later, no one--wife included--recognizes him or believes he is who he claims to be. Mystery thriller relies on its twists (and the suspension of disbelief required to get there) as well as Neeson's dependable presence--he even gets to ""plausibly"" play both an ordinary, exasperated innocent and a formidable action hero. The secret becomes far easier to guess once Langella shows up; he and ex-Stasi agent Ganz possess a weary wisdom that nicely contrasts the slick but formulaic filmmaking. The sort of gimmicky suspenser that demands interest just to figure out what's going on, even as it becomes clearer with every passing minute and complication that it's going to be a letdown. Reminiscent of Roman Polanski's underappreciated ""Frantic,"" which was also built out of contrivances and plot holes, but they were minuscule compared to the ones here.<br/><br/>55/100"

As a few reviewers have said, don't watch it expecting something as good as ""Taken"" just watch it as a good mystery thriller.

","'Unknown' won't be everybody's cup of tea, something that is clear from reading the reviews and the mixed critical reception for it. It did have good potential, with an idea that although very familiar seemed interesting and the always watchable (and more often than not very good) Liam Neeson is enough to peak anyone's interest.<br/><br/>Potential that wasn't quite lived up to fully. Enough of 'Unknown' does work, or at least to me it did (not everybody will agree and that's fine by me), but also from personal opinion what could have been a pretty good film turned out to be an above average but uneven one that could have done much more with what it had. It entertains and intrigues, but doesn't wow. <br/><br/>Mostly 'Unknown' is a good looking film. the cinematography is slick and stylish, that and the suitably bleak setting often adding to the atmosphere created, and the lighting is moody and neither garish or drab. Editing is mostly tight. It's nicely scored, not intrusive but having presence, and the direction is solid.<br/><br/>There is enough taut suspense and fun to keep one gripped and a few interesting twists. The action excites and the more dramatic scenes don't fall into the trap of losing momentum. Liam Neeson is likeable and commanding, while charming Diane Kruger and an immensely engaging Bruno Ganz as the most interesting character fare best of the rest of the cast. Frank Langhella similarly makes his mark, although his role is small. <br/><br/>Sadly, there are exceptions to the acting, with Aidan Quinn blandly uncharismatic in his role. Worse is January Jones, playing her character as too much of the frostiest ice queen which to me seemed a wildly inappropriate approach to her character. The characters generally are pretty sketchy and too much of the dialogue is hammy and vague. <br/><br/>While enough of the film grips, it does get preposterous, credibility-straining and less clear in story in the later stages up until the final twist and ending that is neither clever, original or satisfying. In the busier moments, the photography/editing tended to go wayward and look rushed rather than the controlled and slick film most of the film has. <br/><br/>In summary, decent if unexceptional film that's worth staying known. 6/10 Bethany Cox"
"ChristianLeFeuvre","8","0","0","23 May 2017"," A solid and entertaining thriller
","'Unknown' is about a man named Dr Martin Harris who's on a trip to Berlin for a conference with his wife Elizabeth. When they arrive at their hotel he notices there's a mix-up over a missing case and while travelling back to the airport he's involved in a terrible car accident. When he comes out of the resulting 4 day coma, he has lost fragments of his memory but remembers who he is, is definite of his identity, but when he reunites with his wife she claims not to know him or recognise him in any way and after a heated confrontation she introduces a man she insists is Dr Martin Harris (played by Aidan Quinn), and he even has identification, and photos with Elizabeth, to prove it. Now with everything to do with what he thought was his life seemingly replaced with something, or someone else, and stuck in Berlin without identification papers, it's a race to discover what is going on and for him to get his life back. It's a solid thriller, and has some really good moments and the director does keep the action moving along at a good pace. Liam Neeson is really good, as is Diane Kruger who plays Gina, the taxi driver who was also involved in the accident and is the only one Neeson can rely on for help. There are some good action scenes and a great car chase and the eventual twist at the end of the film is cleverly done too. I will say, I didn't think January Jones, who played Elizabeth, did a very good job in this film, her performance is pretty weak. Also, this film does have a couple of slow parts in the middle, and a couple of extra characters that I didn't feel were particularly necessary either, and there were times while watching this I was reminded of the movie ""Frantic"", in which Harrison Ford played a doctor attending a convention in Paris with his wife. In that movie, the wrong briefcase was picked up at the airport, Ford stepped into the hotel shower, and when he stepped out, he found his wife had vanished. Apart from that comparison, 'Unknown' is a fun and entertaining film. In my opinion it's not as good as 'Taken', but Liam Neeson does make it much better than it could have been."
"jrarichards","8","0","0","19 March 2017"," Stylish thriller that holds its own pretty well
","While the stunts, chases, fights and so on that pepper Jaume Collet-Serra's ""Unknown"" seem at times to push credibility to and beyond its limits, it transpires that they do not do so quite as much as we at first think, for this complex thriller story mostly hangs together well enough, if one is patient enough to wait for the twist in the tale to appear. There have been no shortage of ""respectable guy goes to a foreign city and forgets who he is"" kind of movies, and they are mostly worth a watch. But here an extremely intricate setup is involved, and mostly it's interesting and fun to see how it can possibly all work out...<br/><br/>With that, a lot hangs on how credible Liam Neeson can seem as Dr Martin Harris ... and not Dr Martin Harris. Mostly Neeson seems up to the job, but if his character is to reform, the love and support of a good woman (at last) is a necessity, and a lovely (in every sense) Diane Kruger here comes over very well indeed as ""Gina"", an immigrant from somewhere to the east whose non-legal status in Berlin has given her some of the experience needed to ""keep up"" when Harris's life gets VERY complicated. Two other huge presences in the film are a spellbindingly-good Bruno Ganz as an ex-Stasi man (where we of course know that there can never be such a thing as an ex-Stasi man), and Frank Langella, who - as usual - puts in a great performance, this time as the coolly-likable-yet-horrible Rodney Cole.<br/><br/>For me, a further star of the film is the (to me quite familiar) city of Berlin itself - tamed maybe, compared with its former status, but still giving the impression that anything just might happen there. Playing a key role is the Hotel Adlon Kempinski, just a stone's throw from the Brandenburg Gate, which has seen it's fair share of history (though what we see now is mostly the 1997 rebuild). There are plenty of other settings too, sumptuous or downmarket, and all help contribute to the tangible atmosphere that does quite a lot to make up for other, occasionally over-the-top elements.<br/><br/>Overall, then, an intriguing and satisfying watch with a couple of very good parts well played to savour."

","Liam Neeson has a very particular set of skills and instead of using them to save his family, this time he's using them to save himself. Dr. Martin Harris (Neeson) has gone to Berlin, with his wife, for a medical conference, when an accident has left him in a coma. Upon awaking, no one knows who he is, not even his wife, but worse than that, there is another person walking around claiming to be Martin Harris. I don't know about you, but after three Taken movies and a handful of similar film, all starring Liam Neeson, playing the same type of character in the same type of situations, I've gotten pretty tired of him and his particular set of skills. At least the Taken movies moved at a reasonable pace and had more than a narrow focus, the same can't be said for Unknown. Parts of this film are as slow as can be, featuring Neeson and company sitting around talking about what could be going on and what to do before they show them doing it. They story is also so narrowly focused, that it leaves little flexibility for anything else. This film is as serious as it gets, it is a hundred percent focused on the story at all times, and Liam Neeson is as dry as the banks of the Colorado River. The chase scenes were cool, the conspiracy around everything was well written, but all in all this film feels very long and moves way too slowly for an action thriller, not to mention, I think I speak for everyone when I say we've had more than enough of Liam Neeson in these type of films."

","REVIEW CONTAINS minor SPOILERS<br/><br/>The movie is about an American professor called Dr Martin Harris (Liam Neeson) who goes to Germany with his wife for some important conference talk about agriculture and corn. While he is checking into the hotel, he suddenly realises he forgot his brief case and passport at the airport. He quickly rushes out the door and flags down a taxi. While on the way to the airport, the taxi crashes into a river. He is knocked out but the (I think the character's French) female taxi driver called Gina (Diane Kruger) saves him. When Martin Harris wakes up in a German hospital, he finds that another man has taken his identity. Even his wife doesn't recognise him. With the help of Gina and one of her old Nazi contacts, they slowly uncover the truth. To tell you more would be to spoil the movie, but let's just say you rethink what small part of the movie you saw before the car crash, and - minor spoilers incoming - unnecessarily. This bothered me after I saw the movie, I really would have liked to see lies or very specific things that are only noticeable on a second viewing in the first scene. But you don't need to watch the movie twice to realise that there was nothing hidden in the first scene, because the plot simply didn't allow it. For me that was the biggest let-down with this movie. All the trickery took place after you knew there was trickery going on. This made the movie have less replay value than a movie like Inception or especially Memento. For me at least, I went into this movie thinking it was going to be one thing but it delivered only half that, and the other half fell into another category. What I'm saying there is not that Unknown was a half hearted movie, but it was only half in the category of what I expected it would be fully in.<br/><br/>Liam Neeson performed about as well as in Non-Stop, which is typical Liam Neeson. The real stand out performance was by Diane Kruger who played Gina. I hadn't really noticed Diane in any other movies but in Unknown she really did a good job.<br/><br/>In conclusion, this is basically your typical Liam Neeson movie with really good supporting cast. I personally liked Non-Stop (awesome movie) better but this movie did have it's own charms too.<br/><br/>Would recommend if you're a Liam Neeson fan or someone who has watched too many Christopher Nolan movies and wants to be disappointed with the plot."

After waking from a 4-day coma, he soon discovers that someone has apparently taken his identity, and no one - not even his wife - believes that he is the real Dr. Martin Harris.<br/><br/>This film has it all....great action, suspense, mystery, and a good couple of twists along the way just to keep it even more interesting (especially the main twist at the end). Are some of the scenes unrealistic? Of course. Are they ridiculous, though? Definitely not. There's a difference between unrealistic and unrealistically ridiculous and Unknown falls into the former with these scenes. The thing is, this is an Action/Thriller....if you want pure realism & true to life then watch a Documentary. You get exactly what you pay for with Unknown.<br/><br/>Apart from a few dialogue moments here and there, the film is well written, and even though it's not the most original of story's, it is still more than capable of holding it's own for pure entertainment value. You will notice that Unknown bears huge resemblances to The Bourne Identity (and even Taken to a certain extent), but this shouldn't put you off enjoying what is an enjoyable Action/Thriller.<br/><br/>The cast all do fantastic jobs with their characters as well, from Neeson, Kruger, Jones, and Quinn all great in the main starring roles, to Olivier Schneider and Stipe Erceg as Smith & Jones (no, not THOSE Smith & Jones), who bring such a menace to their characters that you find yourself routing for the ""good guys"" that little bit more.<br/><br/>Unknown is definitely one to watch, so watch it and enjoy it."

"krachtm","6","0","0","5 August 2012"," Derivative movie that pushes suspension of disbelief
","Unknown is not a bad movie. However, the good parts are generally stolen from other movies, and it can be somewhat distracting to constantly be thinking to yourself, ""They stole this from Frantic"" or ""They stole this from Total Recall"". Ostensibly a thriller, it veers from action to thriller to psychological thriller and back to action. With a skilled director, I think this could have been handled a bit better -- or entirely avoided. Thriller fans, who are expecting more realism than action fans, have less tolerance for over-the-top, unrealistic plot lines and stunts that characterize action movies. Also, with the classic 80s and 90s action stars starting to push 60, it's getting a bit more difficult to believe that they're fighting off assassins and seducing 30 year old women. Liam Neeson does a credible job, but I think a younger actor would have been better.<br/><br/>If you're looking for an over-the-top action/thriller hybrid, you could do much worse. It's well-made and has a pretty good cast. I found this movie to push my suspension of disbelief to the breaking point, while being derivative of several classic action and thriller movies. If these issues don't bother you, then I'd recommend Unknown."

"bob the moo","Null","0","0","17 August 2011"," Solid thriller with solid mystery but lacks desperation and claustrophobia in the delivery
","It is a familiar scenario in films to find an ordinary man pulled into a crime bigger than him and unable to turn to the authorities. Hitchcock did it several times (39 Steps, Lady Vanishes, North by Northwest), Johnny Depp did it in Nick of Time and now Liam Neeson gets a run at it. The plot here sees him in Berlin when a car accident puts him in a coma for a few days. When he comes to (without ID) his wife seems to not know him and indeed already has a husband of his name, and who also has full knowledge of everything he claims to know as well. Starting to believe maybe he is crazy, he rapidly learns he is not whenever someone tries to kill him.<br/><br/>Having already punched and kicked his way across most of Paris in Taken, here we get a less action-orientated film in Berlin and the outcome is not quite as fun as Taken although it is a bit more engaging in terms of plot and ideas. The viewer is held pretty well by events on the screen and most of us will have hoped for at least a semi-decent solution to the mystery. Personally I didn't see the solution coming and, although a bit so-so, it was still good enough to do the job and kinda make sense within the internal logic of the film. However since the solution is reasonable simple (comparatively) and comes quickly, the film does spend a lot of time hanging around in the mystery, doing not too much till the solution comes. There are chases and fights but where the film fails is a sense of the world collapsing around Harris. He doesn't quite have the desperation that Harrison Ford had in Frantic (for example) and it is less engaging and exciting as a result.<br/><br/>It still goes through the motions though and some of it is enjoyable as a basic thriller but the sense of losing everything and being desperate to get to the bottom of it all is only ever spoken – not really ever felt. The direction from Collet-Serra is part of it; everything looks professional and money has been spent but he doesn't find the claustrophobia that he needed to find in his scenes and, when it comes down to what the film needed him to do, he is by the numbers, letting the plot do the telling, not his camera. Neeson is a solid oak again – he doesn't have a lot of flair but considering he is 60 next year he convinces in the action roles he has had recently; he cannot find his character's panic though, which is a shame. Kruger is solid in support, as is Jones and Quinn. I liked Quinn here as he had a good character and played it well (but will he ever get away from the YouTube thing?). Langella is a nice bit of casting as he does have a presence naturally.<br/><br/>Overall Unknown is a solid thriller that goes by the numbers, provides the solid solution it had to find and gets out with car chases and guns in its wake. It lacks a real delivery that would have made it great though; it is delivered without any great sense of what it is doing and the director never gets the desperation and claustrophobia that the mystery really could have done with to engage the viewer. It is OK to watch, but watching was all I was doing."

","You're married, have been for a long time. You love your missus.<br/><br/>She loves you.<br/><br/>You go on a working holiday to another country, to attend a conference where you are a key note speaker. It should be a gold star day for you. The wife is by your side beaming But there's a hitch. The taxi ride from the airport to the hotel. Luggage missing. Important luggage. Your notes for the trip and your ID.<br/><br/>Upon realisation you immediately hail another taxi and head back And so begins Unknown, Liam Neeson's second attempt at a action in recent years. Without Taken a few years back, Unknown wouldn't exist, in fact this is the sort of script that Jean-Claude Van Damme would've been all over in the 90s, hardly wide release stuff.<br/><br/>But Taken hit big. So here we – and Mr Neeson – are.<br/><br/>Neeson is Dr Martin Harris, when he realises that he has left essential information at the airport taxi rank he doesn't even bother to inform wife Liz (January Jones) that he is heading back for it. He hails the first cab which happens to be driven by Gina (Diane Kruger) and heads back to the airport. But a major traffic accident that ends with Harris nearly dying and him being dragged from icy waters by Gina is the real spanner in the works.<br/><br/>Harris wakes from his coma four days later. No-one is there to welcome him beside hospital staff. Harris also has no ID, so he checks himself out and heads to the hotel and the gala welcome summit to re-introduce himself and assure everyone that he is OK.<br/><br/>At least that's the plan. No-one – not even Liz – recognises him as Dr Martin Harris, and why would they when another Dr Martin Harris is already there!?! After some obvious confusion on ex-coma Harris' behalf and a brief plea the hotel staff look into the situation, using the internet and Harris ""2's"" ID documents and side with the new guy.<br/><br/>Neeson-Harris is sent back to the hospital to 'get his head right'. He has no ID, minimal cash, no-one in his corner and no idea what the hell is going on. So he decides to get to the bottom of the situation,and with the aid of an elderly German private investigator he tries to piece together his life, starting with taxi driver Gina (Diane Kruger: Who looks a lot like January Jones to me) who ends up accompanying Neeson-Harris for much of his search.<br/><br/>We've seen this film before, and often it is better than Unknown turns out to be. The Long Kiss Goodnight was more trashy fun, and of course the Bourne films were some of the better action films of the last decade.<br/><br/>We can see from the poster where Neeson is holding a pistol that this won't end up a Finding Nemo or Sweet Home Alabama clone, so we know a certain element of violence is inevitable. And there is some action, violence and fatalities, some at the hands of Neeson-Harris himself. But the character lacks the skills of the lead in Taken (aside from being able to drive at top speed through and against heavy traffic on icy roads in a German city!). In Unknown Dr Harris is actually surprised when people die in front of him! Unknown ends up to be mildly intriguing for a while; 'Is he nuts?' 'Is it a complicated conspiracy?' 'Identity theft?' 'An inexplicable mistake?' You guess and second guess for a few minutes but once the answer finally is lazily delivered to you during what Syndrome from The Incredibles would term a 'monologue' you immediately start counting down to the credits.<br/><br/>Once the film concludes and you run through the events with the benefit of hindsight even though the plot hangs together alright it still isn't that satisfying a film, but Neeson as always gives his all and lends a little class to what should by rights be a straight to DVD affair. He obviously likes this action stuff, and strangely enough he's very good at it.<br/><br/>Final Rating – 5.5 / 10. A couple of good moments but Neeson fails to replicate the success of Taken. (I know I mentioned Taken too much: I just love me some Taken.) One last thought: Why do 'top secret' bugs, tracking devices and the like all need blinking lights to draw attention to themselves? Standing out and drawing attention would seem to be non-ideal choice for cladestine, low key equipment."

","""Unknown"" is a somewhat Hitchcockian film about a man who suddenly finds himself caught up in a web of intrigue and pitted against a gang of shady characters in a locale unfamiliar to him – in this case, Berlin; the intrigue involves clever complications ensuing from the muddling of both his memory and identity after a traffic accident and subsequent coma. Too much time is wasted on loud and complicated car chases which cause vast destruction of property, not to mention injuries to humans, all of which surely would have dominated the local headlines for days had they ever actually taken place, but here serve only to inject momentary adrenaline into an unoriginal situation; also we are treated to tightly edited but still unconvincing bouts of hand-to-hand combat from which the contenders emerge without lingering wounds. <br/><br/>""Unknown"" benefits greatly from the presence of those very good actors Liam Neeson, Aidan Quinn, Bruno Ganz, Sebastian Koch and Frank Langella, all of whom are given strong roles. The females (January Jones, Diane Kruger) are presented less interestingly.

","OK, some said it's similar to (Frantic - 1988). Others said it's a complete rip-off from (The Bourne Identity - 2002). And I see that it looks like a better remake of a TV movie, starring (Alec Baldwin), named (Second Nature - 2003)!<br/><br/>Well, to be fair, it has elements that apparently have been dealt with many times lately. However, it holds up nicely. The movie is a good thriller from start to finish. Only the storyline of the old detective, and how it ended, that was a bit forced (I still wonder about the link that led his killer to him!), and the never understood point about how the 2 leads came up with new passports at the last scene? (Liam Nieson) is an action star who wasn't discovered as such until his late fifties. But that has a lovely side since there aren't many action starts, from that category, in Hollywood of today, unless (Harrison Ford); who's not a favorite of mine, while (Nieson) is. (Diane Kruger) proved that she's an actress, not just a pretty girl like she was in (Troy - 2004). The directing is fine; it kept me thrilled. The action sequences are catchy, especially the car chase; being the movie's highest moment. And the cinematography was enjoyable and artistic, with green and dark blue image. I loved particularly that taste of gray ice in some parts; it embodied perfectly the case of coldness that the lead faced during the first 2 acts; which leads to the subject that did interest me the most in (Unknown).<br/><br/>We have a lead that doesn't have an identity, doesn't remember his history, and doesn't have a faith in any human. Add to that, being chased by killers, as if it isn't enough to kill his past and presence, so his future is marked for death as well. It's a dark image for the human of today, living with no name or memory, no love or trust, no peace or home. Therefore, he's always strange in strange land. This sense of pressing, cruel and lasting alienation is so sensed in the list of movies with the same ""unknown"" theme. Although they mostly dealt with it in the format of the spy action thriller, but its melancholic master crises is unmistakable, and its being as frequent in the past decades must mirror an origin in the factual life. It's some reading for the modern age's world, which pushes us to forget everything since it is all horrible, meeting the ultimate fate of being killed or killer, and disappointing the search for the most important question at all: Who Am I? which is - and don't consider it a coincidence - another movie, starring (Jackie Chan), from 1998, about a spy who lost his memory, and wants desperately to not be a stranger, choosing - in the same time - to do the right thing lastly!<br/><br/>Winning knowing yourself can't be happened while you're alone. However, in the awfully cold circumstances that we live, you find yourself forcibly away and alone. Otherwise, you don't have a choice but to be a spy, who lives - at best - many lies after the other, lost in many foreign streets and faces, not enjoying anything real in his life except death. Ahh, we need a lot of carriage to love / do the right thing these days. See how underneath a thriller like that a lot of things, related to you and your life, boil. It's solely a reason to be attracted to such a movie, else being well made."

During the cab ride to retrieve it, his taxi is involved in an accident that leaves him in a coma. When he wakes up three days later, he finds that his wife doesn't know who he is and he had been replaced by another man (Aidan Quinn) claiming to be him. He begins to think he's gone mad until he is nearly captured and killed. With the assistance of the taxi driver Gina (Diane Kruger), he begins to piece his memory back together and tugging at a thread of a vast conspiracy.<br/><br/>""Unknown"" has been unfairly branded as ""Taken 2"" when in reality the two are hardly similar beyond their star and European setting. Don't get me wrong, I quite like ""Taken."" I consider it to be one of the more enjoyable film experiences of 2009, a guilty pleasure if you will. But I have to be honest, it's an absurd movie. Actually, ""absurd"" might be putting it lightly. ""Taken"" is like ""24"" on steroids and that is saying something because as much as I love Jack Bauer (favorite TV character from an hour long drama/action ever), he is nothing if not absurd. <br/><br/>""Unknown"", on the other hand, is a much more reasonable action-thriller, comparatively speaking. The film does an excellent job of keeping you guessing and refusing to allow you to get comfortable with one idea or another. You know Harris isn't insane because the film opens with him and his wife together but you start to wonder if perhaps he created all of that in his mind. When it becomes apparent that he really isn't nuts, you start working to piece together how anyone could pull a conspiracy of this magnitude off such a short period of time. And when the gears of the final twists and turns begin to whirl into motion, you're not sure exactly what's going to happen but you know it's going to be big. Throughout all of this, Harris serves as the voice of the audience. He wonders aloud throughout his searching and asks the questions that I myself was asking while sitting in my easy chair. As confused as we might be watching the mess unfold, it's no more confused than Harris is himself and it is this element that allows it to truly excel.<br/><br/>The actors that surround Neeson all range from marginally mediocre to half way decent and that at times can create an issue or two. In particular, Jones comes off as hollow and one note, just like everything else she's ever been in. But ""Unknown"" starts and ends with Neeson which is a pretty darn good bedrock on which to build a film's foundation. He's always been an excellent actor but in the last few years it seems that he's figured out how to make himself more approachable and therefore more enjoyable to watch. He plays characters that you root for no matter what and that's an underrated talent in Hollywood. He makes bad films pretty good and pretty good films very good. ""Unknown"" is the latter; the concept and subsequent twists would make a solid film regardless but Neeson sells his part wonderfully and pushes the movie to new heights.<br/><br/>Check out my site: www.thesoapboxoffice.blogspot.com"

But everything starts falling apart very quickly, with the film disintegrating into a poorly-mapped, messy and unexplained movie that struggles to even give us a shred of substance as to why we should care what happens to Neeson. Massive plot elements are explained away with one facile line of dialogue after another -- it's as if the screenwriter was trying to pump this one out so fast he would forget what he had already written. In fact, the entire premise of this film is so loosely put together that it's hard to take seriously at all.

Bad script, terribly directed. Most people gave it a shot including me expecting a ""Taken"" however it is nothing like ""Taken"". UNKNOWN is literarily unknown because the movie has no identity, stupid plot, old school kinda hints which made the suspense so dull and amateur. Diane Kruger fake accent was so bad, and poor January Jones- What happened to her? Random cast with no cohesiveness whatsoever. The ending was horrendous. I wouldn't watch it even if it was for free.

","Unknown (2011)<br/><br/>If you don't mind implausibility on a platter, and lots of formula stuff packed into a modern day Berlin thriller, you might just like this movie. It's well made, in physical terms, and the acting is good if nothing distractingly good.<br/><br/>But boy do you have to look the other way time and again as the actors do ridiculous things. Even when the biggie (huge) twist occurs partway through, it doesn't change the unreasonable behavior of many of the leads, both on the good side and the bad. And most of it was avoidable, maybe just a matter of expedience to get to the next creepy moment, or the next fistfight (there are a couple of doozies), or the next car chase (there is an epic pair of those, too).<br/><br/>I like Liam Neeson the way you might like a lonely neighbor for Thanksgiving. He's warm and a gentle guy, sort of big and sort of handsome and totally regular. I don't think he's an amazing actor, for sure, but he holds his own as a seeming biotech research whiz going to an international conference. At first the leading woman in his life is his wife, but that doesn't last long, and the real star as his female counterpart is pan-Euro, German born actress Diane Kruger, who is sharp and excellent. Oddly, she plays an illegal immigrant who isn't German at all, and pulls it off completely.<br/><br/>You might compare this movie to any number of recent international intrigue movies, but this one has at its core a particular kind of brain washing, or memory lapse, that is an echo of Jason Bourne (and a bit more believable, in a way, since Neeson doesn't play a superhero in any sense). It also has a resemblance to a recent Liam Neeson movie, ""Taken,"" where he again plays the disgruntled everyman on the warpath for justice against his dignity (his daughter was kidnapped in that one). <br/><br/>I did mention, though that the movie patently absurd. I'll give one example at the start--he forgets his briefcase at the airport and realizes this at the hotel and instead of just popping his head in the door to tell his wife he's going back to get it, he just hails a cab and is gone. Then, in the cab, there is no cell service. In downtown Berlin. Okay, it's a conspiracy, and they've tampered with his phone and his wife is really a double-agent plant and so it's all logical. Except not quite. You'll see.<br/><br/>But because it's so implausible, you do give up worrying about it being at all true and just go for the fantasy, like maybe ""Minority Report"" gets away with by just setting it a bit in the future. ""Unknown,"" with its wishy-washy title, is hard to hate, because it's fast and fun, but it's hard to especially like or admire, either. That much is known."

Neeson thinks he might just be going crazy from the coma, but then the bad guys spoil that thought by trying to kill him. <br/><br/>Why are the bad guys trying to kill him? I was wondering that too. Why did the wife not remember him or, maybe, PRETENDING to not remember him? I didn't know and I waited for the movie's explanation. When it is revealed (and yes it is revealed), it was so contrived that I sat livid in my seat. The third act to this movie was such a mess and the explanations given to what was really going on made this almost a completely different movie. Why did they go this route? Were the writers stuck on where to go with this concept? It sure seemed like it. Writer's Block can sometimes be a hindrance to the overall writing process that it would effect the total outcome to your film. I'm surprised the actors went with it as there are some good performances to be had in this. <br/><br/>I'd rather see Taken again before seeing this one. It wasn't a horrible film as the action scenes were top notch. I didn't care for some of the jump cuts in the fighting scenes as I couldn't tell what was going on. But with some truly nasty villains and heart pumping chase scenes, it was at least entertaining. Now Liam, go make Taken 2!"

","At the time that I am writing this, this movie has 72.7% 10/10 out of 687 votes. Together with a trailer that looked to me like it could be more than just a joyride, I expected that this would be a more meaningful movie starring Liam Neeson and not another ""Taken"". Unfortunately for me, that expectation was wrong.<br/><br/>If you go in expecting a nice ride with a couple of twists somewhat similar to ""Taken"", you'll get what you want. But if you expect more... no such luck. How the story is wrapped up is pure cliché and the movie even includes that seemingly never-ending car chase that had at least me yawning. It would have been great if ""Unknown"" would have actually dealt more in-depth with the terror of memory loss and identity theft and other possible developments I will not go into because I don't want to spoil anything. There are some interesting twists in the movie but they're of the mainstream kind, not the thoughtful one.<br/><br/>Being a native German speaker, what was very impressive to me about this movie was how the creators did not shy away from plastering ""Unknown"" with German details. A decent amount of subtitles, a huge amount of papers/signs/etc. in German on screen throughout the movie - this definitely does not feel like it could have been filmed anywhere else. Although thanks to CG it may well have been. Still, basically every scene reminds you that you're not in that average-city that so many movies seem to play in.<br/><br/>Overall, an impressively done film that is simply lacking substance and there were one or two visual effects that looked inadequate for a production of this category. As I argued in the beginning - it is all about what you expect/want from ""Unknown""."

The characters literally did the complete opposite of what most sane, rational people would do in their shoes and we don't have ""super spy assassin"" skills! In one scene Neeson and the woman escape 2 assassins coming to kill them in her apt. They kill one of them and run out of the apartment building (it's about 4 stories tall). They get in a taxi and speed off. At this moment the 2nd assassin is in her apartment 4 stories up watching them out a window speed away in the taxi. Mind you, they are in the car and gone and he is 4 stories up in the apartment... next scene they appear to only be a few blocks away and somehow the assassin comes out of nowhere and slams his car into theirs! Come on! He got all the way down 4 stories, into his car and was able to loop around in front of them to t-bone them from the right at an intersection?!

","An American couple arrive at Berlin for a summit on biochemistry; there is peculiar atmosphere, a suitcase left behind.

Is it going to be some cheap Face/Off clone except without the actual face change? Is it going to rip off The Game, some other film about the hero a hapless pawn in shady conspiracies? <br/><br/>It gets worse as you keep watching. More exasperatingly implausible, downright stupid. Bruno Ganz shows up and, of course, he rattles off about the shame of Nazi heritage to a stranger he met just two minutes ago. He is completely wasted, as is Frank Langella. Liam Neeson - who, for some reason, I keep thinking as the Randolph Scott of our times, with the benign face and rugged demeanor - mostly coasts through this. With Taken, he at least seemed to be mildly interested in the role of the avenging father.<br/><br/>So, it's basically bottom-of-the-barrel patchwork stuff with some sheen of professionalism (read safe, pedestrian, unimaginative), a slot-filler for the multiplex while catchier stuff awaits release.

","Whilst originally my friends and I were going to watch ""The Resident,"" the theatre workers wouldn't allow us in because we didn't have ID, even though it was a 15. So we settled for ""Unknown"" just for the fact that Liam Neeson voices Aslan in Narnia and the synopsis in the movie sounded interesting.<br/><br/>The film started off very well with well executed camera shots and little details that tie in to the movie and Liam Neeson does a very convincing job acting as Michael Harris. There wasn't a point in the movie where the movie felt slow and sluggish; everything flowed nicely.<br/><br/>Whilst the plot is linear, there are quite a lot of flashbacks in the movie which gives it an Inception-esque like feel, where at the end of it all you go ""ahh, I get it now."" The movie does a good job confusing the viewers but then making them understand the story right at the end.<br/><br/>The storyline itself is excellent, however, some people might be able to predict it before the ending. Even if you did guess the ending, the satisfaction is still there at the end for actually understanding it.<br/><br/>Try not to take any bathroom breaks though because almost all of the movie is important and to miss any of it will hinder how much you understand the story.<br/><br/>The camera angles and special effects are very good. The fire is convincing and the car chase scenes are well executed. I was quite tense throughout the film, sat up in my seat in anticipation.<br/><br/>Don't be put off by it's 12A (UK) rating. This movie should have been a 15. It has quite a lot of sexual humour in it.

","The first half hour of this film is excellent. Somewhat Hitchcockian in theme and atmosphere, the film focuses on Dr. Martin Smith, in Berlin with his wife for a biotechnology conference where he's a presenter. But his briefcase is left at the airport; he goes back for it...and there the fun begins.<br/><br/>In many ways this movie reminded me of the Harrison Ford film ""Frantic,"" in which Ford played a doctor visiting Paris to attend a conference. After checking in to his hotel, he loses his wife. Did he even have a wife? With everyone so skeptical of him, he has to investigate her all by himself, at some point picking up a young hottie who gets drawn into helping him. <br/><br/>Unknown is the same thing, only different. The problem in in the second act where the story should be developed...convincingly. There are a number of twists, but they pop up too late and too abruptly so you end up guffawing at them. Despite those flaws, I did find it entertaining in spots and wouldn't mind watching it again...on DVD. <br/><br/>Considerable acting talent was employed in this film. Liam Neeson, Bruno Ganz, and Frank Langella are la creme de la creme. I'm sure both Langella & Ganz knew the script was entirely working, but, hey, a payday is a payday. <br/><br/>Taken, by comparison, is a superior movie. This film is like Frantic, the Bourne Identity, and the Long Kiss Goodnight all rolled together but not blended very well."
"Michael_Elliott","Null","3","10","16 March 2011"," Nice Thriller But the Ending Doesn't Quite Work
","Unknown (2011) <br/><br/>*** (out of 4) <br/><br/>Fairly entertaining thriller has Liam Neeson playing Dr. Martin Harris who travels to Germany with his wife (January Jones) as he's about to give a speech on biotechnology. Martin forgets a piece of luggage so he heads back to the airport but along the way his cab wrecks and he's knocked out. When he wakes up he has no memory of who he is but bits and pieces slowly start to come back. When he's able to reach his wife she says she has no idea who he is so Martin must try and figure out who he is and why his wife says she doesn't know him. UNKNOWN isn't a masterpiece and it's not going to be confused with a Hitchcock film but if you don't mind a nice little ""B"" picture then it offers up enough entertainment. I think what makes the film work so well is that you've got an actor of the caliber of Neeson who can make you believe things even when the screenplay starts to become a tad bit silly. Neeson is really getting good at playing in these types of movies and while this one here doesn't reach the levels of TAKEN he still makes it good enough for a viewing. I thought Neeson did a very good job during the scenes where he's struggling to remember who he is. This part of the screenplay allows for the acting to tell the story and Neeson does very well with it. The first hour or so is mostly story driven as we don't get any lousy action scenes and for the most part you're zipping along with Neeson trying to figure everything out. Many will remember Diane Kruger from Tarantino's INGLOURIOUS BASERDS but she delivers a very good performance here as the taxi driver who helps Martin try to figure out his past. Neeson and Kruger have some nice chemistry together and they make for a fun team. It was nice seeing Aidan Quinn again as he adds nice support as the man claiming to be Martin. Bruno Ganz nearly steals the film as a German investigator who believes Martin is telling the truth and sets out to help him. Frank Langella appears late in the film so you should know what that means. For the first hour the film is pretty much a roller coaster ride with a story that works very well because it keeps you guessing and there are enough good twists and turns to keep you interested. With about a half hour left we start getting into some rather silly action sequences and before long the brain turns itself off. I will admit that I was guessing up to the very end and I didn't see the final twist coming but at the same time I found the explanation of everything to be rather weak. It's a nice twist but in this type of film it's best not to feel cheated but I did to a point. With that said, the first hour is so good and the cast in such fine form that it makes the film worth seeing."

","The movie has a promising beginning, a mysterious middle, and a let-down of an ending. I wanted to enjoy the movie, and I wasn't trying to poke holes in the plot, but here are the questions that popped into my head as I was watching: 1: If the guys trying to ""take out"" Dr. Martin were highly skilled assassins, why then were they killing nurses and taxi drivers unnecessarily like common thugs? 2: How did Jurgen figure out that Frank Langella's character was coming to kill him? Also, how did Jurgen figure out the twist with the briefcase? 3: Why was this group hired to steal a formula for hybrid corn? If it was simply because the people who hired them wanted to profit off of the formula, it seems that it could have been done in a much less elaborate fashion (but then why make a movie, I suppose). 4: Since when is ""sudden acquisition of morals"" a side-effect of major head trauma? 5: Why does trained assassin Frank Langella run and hide in a van until he ultimately falls to his death? I have many more questions as to why the writers/director/producers decided that this story was ready for public consumption, but then again, maybe I'm just being too cynical."

","Despite what some critics say, this is not anywhere near as good as Liam Neeson's action/thriller from last year, TAKEN. This film takes a long time to get going and, unfortunately, when it finally does we don't care all that much because Neeson's character remains essentially an unknown and the plot twist renders him somewhat unsympathetic. In fact, ""the twist"" really left me cold. I no longer felt emotionally concerned with Neeson's character beyond wanting him to succeed in order to prevent innocent people from being hurt.<br/><br/>Although Neeson is good, Bruno Ganz steals the show as an ex-Stasi (East German secret police) officer turned private investigator who tries to help Neeson's amnesiac character find out why someone's impersonating him. Diana Kruger is OK, too, but it's laughable to believe someone who looks like her (she played Helen of Troy for heaven's sake!) would be a taxi driver in Berlin, even if she were an illegal immigrant. All told, this is a fairly run-of-the-mill action thriller."

Yes, there are some major plot holes, but when you have an original film coming out of Hollywood (even if it is based on a novel) it's a treat, so why moan, especially when it's produced with panache from Joel silver.<br/><br/>If you cross 'frantic' and very loosely 'the sixth day' you end up with unknown.<br/><br/>Neeson is as good as ever, and i have a feeling now that he will be in a lot more films where he becomes a man on a mission.

What I saw was a lame concoction of the bourne identity, the saint, and taken, put together in a blender, with a sprinkle of predictable, and a whole bunch of lame acting. Don't get me wrong, Liam played his role very well, but the whole plot around him was too recycled and the dialog was mundane. January Jones acted exactly the same as she does in Mad Men, in which I think she plays the cold, naive, clueless wife role very well. Well, it doesn't work in all shows or movies, Jan. And Diane Kruger, whom I actually like, was also disappointing, and her case was not helped with the weakness of the dialog she had. Then there is your typical cheap thriller movies plot holes, characters that add little to no value, and unnecessary long ""you're going to die"" scenes. <br/><br/>If you have nothing to do on an evening, and you happen to be in the theater, and you're in the mood to NOT think, and there is nothing else to watch, then I guess this movie is watchable.

","**Spoiler Alert** This review is definitely not intended for people who have not seen this movie. Furthermore, other reviewers (300 of them) have already discussed the merits and flaws associated with this movie. The purpose of this review is to point out the presence of a hidden (or not so hidden) message behind most thrillers or action movies. Having watched hundreds of such movies, I would say that at least 90% of them have a left-leaning slant. Since ""Unknown"" has been compared by several reviewers to ""The Bourne Identity"", I will briefly discuss these two movies (which I both enjoyed by the way). <br/><br/>The obvious message behind the latter is that the CIA is a ruthless organization which, knowingly or unknowingly, allows the assassination of foreign nationals and, if necessary, its own operatives. The message behind ""Unknown"" is less obvious. After all, the movie was made during a different U.S. administration. The intended victim of the assassination was described in the movie as a German ""liberal"" whose purpose was to provide easy access to food throughout the world. In contrast, the hired assassins were all American. It was left unclear who had hired them, but it was definitely not a liberal organization (neither governmental nor nongovernmental).<br/><br/>In my opinion, it's very unfortunate that movie viewers are subjected to this type of nonsense when they are trying to relax and forget about politics."

","It is no doubt exciting and intense, and Liam Neeson is as fantastic as ever in the spy-kick butt-ery role. The twist is nifty but after that is spoiled it feels like there isn't much left to the audience to make them wonder what could happen next. <br/><br/>Despite that, I love the noire film style and the gritty Berlin exterior, and the action scenes are crazy and brutal. <br/><br/>This is a smart thriller with shades of very good film making thrown in. <br/><br/>It's not the best thriller, but kudos for finally making and darned fun and entertaining one."
"cat_ranchero","7","1","2","20 January 2013"," Does what it says on the tin...
","Very well made with some very slick editing keeping the pace pretty high all the way through. It did feel a little like a travelogue in parts, giving us all the iconic views of Berlin whenever the plot brings the action outside. To be fair though, there are a few seedier parts of the city shown as well. All the main cast played their parts well with Liam Neeson and Diane Kruger standing out. I also enjoyed the performance of Bruno Ganz as the ageing former Stazi agent and it was nice to see Frank Langella as Martin's old colleague, Rodney Cole. Over all, a decent watch that doesn't really break any new ground but does what it says on the tin (and I can't knock it for that).<br/><br/>SteelMonster's verdict: RECOMMENDED<br/><br/>My score: 7.0/10.<br/><br/>You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster."
"jbecket","10","1","2","2 June 2012"," Brilliant script
","A very satisfying thriller with a brilliant script full of misdirection taking us along for the ride noticing little inconsistencies and oddities and then at the end a total surprise ending makes all those questions fall neatly into place. For me it was the script that put it way above the normal fare and then all the elements were well executed. And it's always fun with a thriller for an audience to be taken to a foreign locale and in this case seeing much of the city of Berlin from the heights to the depths. Our total sympathies lie with the Liam Neeson character who is trying to establish his identity and the very people he knows so well refuse to acknowledge that they know him. And the ending managed to work out to everyone's satisfaction, most of all the audience. A good example of the thriller genre with the complexity modern audiences demand. A much more interesting movie than TAKEN which was a linear recover my daughter story."

","The first best thing about this film is the actors and the special effects- they did a really good job on those. I have always been a fan of Liam Neeson and his performance. The guy always delivers. However I fear that despite the good acting Unknown would work for Liam Neeson just as Catwoman worked for Halle Berry.<br/><br/>The second best thing about the movie is that it will create the self confidence in future wannabe screen writers, that they can create something much more original. It is so predictable. Things start to unravel with a few words just as the characters walk out of the airport. At the time when Liam Neeson meets the second ""Martin"" everything falls into place and your every guess will hit the mark, almost as if you have written it yourself. Back when The Manchurian Candidate came out things seemed interesting. Then came The Bourne failure- granted with quite a few nice special effects. The idea that a self-manchurian-ation is possible, although original, should be better left alone in the hands of writers who are not too eager to do their own research. It is my guess that the brain-washed-spy flicks will be over with Unknown.... Oh wait! I guessed wrong- The Bourne Legacy is coming out in summer 2012. Now that should be good!"

"johnnyfry2","8","1","2","30 January 2012"," Manner in which they portrayed Stasi agent
","I liked the movie, it was enjoyable and although it may seem far fetched the business of spooks and spies is not surprisingly immoral and shocking so anything is possible.<br/><br/>I am not here to discuss the movie because I did enjoy it. However, I did want to mention my dismay with the manner in which they portrayed the Stasi agent (Ernst Jurgen?). When he realizes he is going to be killed he takes the ""honourable path"" by committing suicide. This, after giving a tender speech about how he is a throw back, a man who was proud in his skill in his former calling and thus, unknown to the assassin sent to kill him, he commits suicide.<br/><br/>As someone who has read two very powerful non-fiction books about the Stasi (The File and Stasiland) I was slightly offended by the characterization of this man. Although we do not know if he was a foreign operative when he worked for Stasi or a domestic spook, there is enough historical evidence to suggest how vile, immoral and damaging this agency was to the East German people. Many died in their fight for democracy in that former Communist state, many died or disappeared at the hands of the Stasi for trying to climb the wall to freedom, or for simply not buying into the ""Party"" line.<br/><br/>I understand the purpose of this character, I also understand that the Stasi are renowned for their skill in the spy craft (an almost obsessive desire for control and persecution of their fellow countrymen, to the detriment and suffering of its citizens). However, the viewer was almost driven to respect for this man; as if he came with a badge of honour for his former work, when in reality, most Stasi agents feared for their own lives after the fall of the Berlin wall because the citizens who were persecuted under them were so upset with the suffering they experienced at the hands of these monsters.<br/><br/>I know it is just a movie. I just wish the writers/directors/producers, whomever would have considered the historical context of these agents. I am guessing suicide would be too courageous an option to explore for a true Stasi agent. They were by most accounts, though not all , bullies and willing oppressors.<br/><br/>Just my two cents for what it is worth. All in all a great movie. Thanks for your time. Let me know if you agree or not (for all those spy buffs or historians out there)."

","Unknown is not the worst film i have seen this year but certainly not the best.To be honest the endless comparisons with 'Taken' were very misleading going into the film.The only thing i found similar between the two films were its European setting.Its not original in the slightest,man loses memory,runs around a bit,gets paranoid,forgets how to act etc. I like Neeson but he seems bored in this film.Frank Langella is wasted once again in what could have been a great role,a scene where he confronts an East German spy with riddled dialogue is plain boring. <br/><br/>I was expecting a fast-paced suspenseful thriller but was left disappointed,only because of the misleading one word reviews on the DVD case.

Great performances and though I never say this - great locations. I don't know why, they just fit the story perfectly.<br/><br/>It was a movie with a taste of Bourne Identity to it, but better.<br/><br/>In the end, it left me with only one question, one that I can only wave off as, ""Well, there wouldn't have been a movie if that hadn't happened.""<br/><br/>Rent, buy or otherwise see this movie, you'll love it."

","My wife and I very much enjoyed this film. We we're hoping it would entertain us as much as Liam Neeson's earlier movie called ""Taken."" In fact, I thought this is a better movie than Taken. There was nothing predictable about it. The movie leaves you hanging on the edge of your seat from beginning to end. It didn't seem like a cheap action flick either. It seemed well made, like a high budget film. I think Neeson plays these roles very well. The strong, mysterious, sophisticated characters. Much like the type of roles that Harrison Ford played in his hay day. Will definitely be on the lookout for a next Neeson film because we truly enjoyed this."

","Comparisons with Taken, Liam Neeson's action tour de force, are both apt and improper. This is much more of a thriller, where a doctor wakes from a coma to find that only he believes who he is. Thanks to how the film start, so does the audience and the script smartly makes you doubt the main character after a while.<br/><br/>But this is not a mystery film and it soon cranks up the dials, converting into a pseudo-action movie that is just on the border of believable. A lot of this goes to Neeson, whose worst talent as an actor is to fake an American accent. His best, though, is his screen presence and ability to take the audience along. Give him a well-paced script and he does brilliantly. And here he does brilliantly. Even if you see the twist coming, you'll enjoy the ride."

","Liam Neeson does not understand why his wife (January Jones, on vacation from MAD MEN) pretends she does not know him, or why everyone is being so nasty to him, but he is mostly peeved that someone else has stolen his identity and is posing as him with his own wife! That is enough to annoy anyone. January Jones is as icy as in the latter episodes of MAD MEN, and one would not want to mess with her. Neeson has lost much of his memory as a result of bumping his head when the taxi he was in went off a bridge and into a river. He keeps trying to tell people that he is Dr. Martin Harris, a scientist. We already know this because that's who he was at the beginning of the film. However, he has lost his passport and all his personal papers, and cannot prove his identity. Then people want to kill him, so he is on the run. He finds the young woman who had been driving the taxi when it went off the bridge, an illegal immigrant (they are in Berlin, capital of the Fourth Reich, of which Greece, Ireland and Portugal have now become colonies, as you may have noticed), but she is wary of being exposed and he has to chase her. She is excellently played by Diane Kruger, with nervous intensity. A German nurse who tries to help Neeson is murdered by some vicious hit-men. But before she died she gave Neeson the name and address of a man who might help him, saying that 'he is an expert at finding people'. This man, played by a somewhat aged Bruno Ganz ('ganz' means 'entire', and Ganz has always been entirely a star), turns out to be a former Stasi officer. He helps Neeson but ends up having to take a cyanide pill when about to be tortured by an emissary from America's 'Section 15', an assassination bureau. Is a Saudi prince about to be blown up by a bomb? Is a new breed of corn resistant to disease about to be announced at the conference which is going to ruin the future of Monsanto? (Monsanto is not named, or there would be more than Section 15 on the rampage.) And then there is 'the other Dr. Martin Harris', menacingly played by Aidan Quinn, who is now living with Neeson's wife in the very suite, the Eisenhower Suite, in the Hotel Adlon where Neeson was supposed to be. How dare he pretend to be Neeson, as he simply does not have the profile for it (and who else does have that profile?). One of the most menacing of all the performances is by Frank Langella as Rodney Cole. There is plenty of intrigue here for everyone. The action is fast but not so fast you can't keep up. That is, if you have the stamina and can take it, as this film is extraordinarily harrowing. It is a first-rate bone-shaking thriller, and not to be seen when you are on your own or suffering from any form of identity crisis. The film was directed by the Spaniard, Jaume Collet-Serra, who directed ORPHAN (2009)."

","***SPOILERS*** In what looks like a combination of two Harrison Ford thrillers ""The Fugitive, and "" Frantic"" Liam Neeson plays Biotech, who specializes in plant life, professor Martin Harris who in a matter of days loose not only his identify but but his pretty blond wife Elizabeth, January Jones, as well.<br/><br/>Attending a biotechnology summit at the Adlon Hotel in downtown Berlin Harris notices that he left his briefcase and all his papers and document at the Berlin airport and takes a taxi there to retrieve it. With the taxi involved in a smash up on the Berlin Bidge Harris is rescued by the cab driver Gina, Diane Kruger, who takes off before the police arrives! As we soon learn Gina is an illegal immigrant from Bosnia and fears that she may be deported back there if the police find out about her status in the country.<br/><br/>It's at the hospital that Harris coming out of a coma senses that something isn't right in finding out from the Berlin Police Department that his wife Elizabeth never filed a missing person report on him with him being hospitalized for four days! All that with him as well as the hospital staff, in that Harris didn't have any identification on him, not being able to contact her! It's later when Harris taking off against his doctors orders arrives at the Adlon Hotel to see his wife that he finds her with another man , Aidan Quinn, who claims to be her husband Martin Harris!<br/><br/>In an effort to find out who he is Harris, or whoever he is, tries to track down the cab driver Gina who by getting involved with him ends up putting her life on the line! In that Harris is now targeted for elimination by these two hit-men Smith & Jones, Oliver Schneider & Stipe Erceg, since despite his amnesia he knows too much about what's really going to happen at the biotechnology summit that he and Elizeabth are to attend. It was at the hospital that nurse Gretchen Erfurt, Eva Lobau, tipped Harris off to where to get help in finding himself by getting in touch with her good friend former East German intelligence agent Ernst Jurgen, Bruno Ganz. As it later turned out both Nurse Erfurt and Mr. Jurgen ended up losing their lives in trying to help Harris find out just who he is which in fact was by far the biggest mystery in the entire movie!<br/><br/>***SPOILERS*** Liam Neeson looked very uncomfortable playing a brainy botanically professor Martin Harris but really got into stride when he took off the gloves and started kicking butt all over Berlin in him finally finding out that he was in fact a plant, figuratively not literally, together with his old lady Elizabeth put into the biotechnology summit to assassinate Prof. Leo Bessler, Sebastian Koch. It's Prof. Bessler who had invented this new crop,that can grown in any kind of weather or environment, that will put the world's food conglomerates out of business! What's even more shocking to Harris is that he together with Elizabeth was the one who planted the bomb at the hotel some three months earlier to go off just when Prof. Bressler was to give his speech in making his new wonder crop available to the world's nations at no charge! This was to eliminate hunger as well as eliminating the profits of the major food conglomerates who are behind the plot to murder him and everyone else at the summit!<br/><br/>Getting down to the business at hand Martin with his memory now completely recovered goes after those who are out to spoil the party, the biotechnology summit, by exposing both Harris, the impostor, and his phony wife Elizabeth who together with their boss master spy and assassin Rodney Coal, Frank Langella, are out to turn it into a German version of 9/11. We have two exciting car chases as well as a confrontation between Harris and Harris at the Adlon Hotel with the bomb that Harris planted there that's set to go off at any moment. In the end Harris after taking care of business, Rodney Coal & his hoods, takes off for Canada with Gina who saved his life more then once in the movie where they can get away from all the dangerous spy and assassination business that they found themselves involved in Berlin."

The script piles on one unbelievable thing after another for so long that by the time you ever get to the moment where he makes the first reconnection with his life, you no longer care. It just looks silly for so long that it destroys any interest you might have had at all, which wasn't much. I like the reviewer's remark elsewhere about the plot depending on stupid things one after the other: both Martin and the cab driver leave his (passport containing!!) briefcase on the luggage cart at the airport (they try to make it work by having the wife interrupt Martin during loading, but it's lame anyway); Martin is briefly unable to get a cellphone signal on the way to the Berlin airport. Right.<br/><br/>Oh yes, and the ending is a sore-thumb obvious setup for the two characters to spend another movie going after the bastards who killed her family in Bosnia. You see, her family was murdered, Liam used to be a bad-ass, but now he's a good guy, but with all that know-how.

I think that Neeson to seriously review his attitude and provide a heartfelt apology to the Albanians and other nations that he has offended with negative stereotypes. Need we remind him of the negative stereotypes that have followed Irish men and women for centuries and which have played a negative role in the creation of positive relationships and positive role models.

It rarely feels like your watching something filmed in a studio with a green-screen. The story also does a good job of leaving you hanging. Just when you think you know what's going on, there's another twist. Even when a character tells you what's going on, you're not sure if the character is lying. Something like a Philip K. Dick story without the sci-fi (OK, there's a little sci-fi).<br/><br/>About the only real thing wrong with it are the car chases and bombs (actually labeled plastic explosive - if you're going to oversimplify that much, you should at least add some humor/insight to it by putting a logo/brand name on it of an actual military contractor).

","I saw many clips of this on television in small trailers, so I knew a little about the premise, but of course I had to see it all, from director Jaume Collet-Serra (House of Wax, Orphan). Basically American Bio-technologist Dr. Martin Harris (Liam Neeson) arrives in Berlin with beautiful wife Elizabeth (January Jones) to attend the Biotechnology Submit, but they have some luggage missing at the hotel. Taking a taxi to go back to the airport, he and his driver Gina (Inglorious Basterds' Diane Kruger) have an accident, falling off a bridge and crashing into the river, she rescues him but disappears from the scene. Martin regains consciousness after spending four days in a coma, he has suffered temporary amnesia, but he remembers who he is, his wife and the purpose of his visit. Leaving the hospital immediately he gets security to find his wife, but she appears not to recognise him and another man, Martin B (Aidan Quinn), in fact she is deliberately refusing to identify him. Martin realises his identity has been stolen, his only hope to is to find the taxi driver, the only witness, to help prove who he is, but she for a while refuses as she is worried he will force her out of the country. He also finds Ernst Jürgen (Downfall's Bruno Ganz) who is an expert in ""finding"" people, of course at the same time there are men trying to find and seemingly kill Martin, including Rodney Cole (Frank Langella). The big plot is to assassinate Prince Shada visiting the country, and after eventually realising he is not really Dr. Martin Harris, but a professional hit-man assigned to this job, he does everything with his newfound conscience to prevent this plan, and the end he seems to disappear with Gina. Also starring Sebastian Koch as Professor Leo Bressler, Karl Markovics as Dr. Farge, Stipe Erceg as Jones and Rainer Bock as Herr Strauss. It is a similar style of role as he played in Taken, but Neeson is good being confused and aggressive in moments, the supporting cast members, including Kruger and Ganz, get their moments too, there are small slow downs and the stolen identity plot is a little up and down in parts, imitating Bourne or something, but overall it's not a bad conspiracy style thriller. Worth watching!"

","Even with some relatively decent car chase/street scenes and an intriguing premise of one ""losing his mind"", Unknown felt generic to me.<br/><br/>Liam Neeson (Taken, Schindler's List, Chloe) is in Berlin for a conference with his wife January Jones (X-Men: First Class, ""Mad Men"", Bandits). As she is checking into their hotel, he realizes a bag was left at the airport and he returns to get it ... only to be in an automobile accident which leaves him comatose for four days. When he awakens, he is not who he believed/remembers himself to be.<br/><br/>Stranded in a foreign city with only his cab driver (Diane Kruger - Troy, Inglourious Basterds, National Treasure) ""remembering him"", he sets out to discover why his past is so secretive and how come he vividly remembers ONLY portions of it. As his wife no longer knows who he is, her husband (now played by Aidan Quinn -- Michael Collins, Jonah Hex, Legends of the Fall) has his name but isn't HIM! Neeson finds himself working against all odds to figure out the mystery behind himself.<br/><br/>While there is nothing technically wrong with Unknown, there just isn't anything spectacular about it either. The plot grows and builds and bit-by-bit our ""hero"" puts all of the pieces back together again (think Memento ... only not in reverse and not as good). That the cast was so nice to look at and the film had such a frenzied pace in a foreign locale, Unknown reminded me of the 1988 Harrison Ford flick, Frantic.<br/><br/>Without giving too much of it away, it is easy to say that Unknown is as generic as it's name. All pieced together it comes out as a new film; but taken apart piece-by-piece one can see what Unknown shares with every other known suspense/thriller of mistaken identity Hollywood has ever given us. It is fine (and better than many) ... just don't expect anything shockingly new or original with Unknown."
"GenXer","7","1","3","3 July 2011"," Major plot hole and cheesy politics tarnish an otherwise great effort
","Watching this movie was an unusual experience. I began by expecting it to be a long Twilight Zone episode. Then I was turned off by what seemed to be a contrived and overly artsy narrative, then I got confused. By the time I started coming out confusion, about three quarters into the movie, I was at the edge of my seat. And through it all, I was mesmerized by Diane Krueger.<br/><br/>This is an ambitious movie that's trying to be an old-fashioned, hard-hitting, thought-provoking, espionage thriller. And it comes damn close to hitting its mark. Unfortunately, it falters on two key points.<br/><br/>First, it is impossible to forge an identity as a university faculty. And it's even more impossible (?) to fake a university. The story loses all of its credibility on this point alone.<br/><br/>Second, it all at the end gets reduced to a reactionary Hollywood left-wing piece of hysterical propaganda aimed at the evil Corporate America. Enough already! <br/><br/>This director has a real talent for bringing out the charisma in his actors. Diane Krueger and Bruno Ganz stood out for me, but I was impressed with everyone's performance. They were all natural, believable, and likable.<br/><br/>At the very least, I hope this kicks off a trend in Hollywood that will replace this silly infatuation with sequels, remakes, and reboots.<br/><br/>Thanks for the attempt."

","A briefcase felt on a luggage cart at the airport, is the cause of setting this thriller in motion. Dr. Martin Harris and his wife, arriving in Berlin for a biochemical convention, are staying at the famous Adlon Hotel in the city. As Martin notices the missing piece of luggage, he takes a taxi back to the airport to claim it, without even having the chance to tell Mrs. Harris he is going back. On the way, the taxi, trying to avoid a falling object, plunges into the river, but miraculously saved by the woman taxi driver.<br/><br/>Martin Harris' troubles begin right away. Taken to a hospital in a coma, he shows signs of suffering from temporary memory loss on the fourth day, when he awakens. Unknown to him, there are people that are interested in getting to him before he can get to the famous convention. A big chase for Martin Harris begins all over Berlin. To his amazement, Dr. Harris, going back to the Adlon, finds out there is another Martin Harris that has an interest in derailing the convention in a daring move that the real Martin helped set up months earlier.<br/><br/>Jaume Collet-Serra, the director, gives the audience an entertaining and fast moving thriller, even though it might not make complete sense, but it is a non stopping ride, at that. The film is based on a French novel by Didier Van Cauwelaert, which was released as ""Out of My Head"". The adaptation is by Oliver Butcher and Stephen Cornwell. On the plus side, the excitement of the various chases through the streets of Berlin are well staged. The final sequence at the Adlon is an amazing achievement. Mr. Collet-Serra shows a visual style for this genre, even though the screenplay reminds us of other films that came before this one.<br/><br/>Liam Neeson has found himself a new persona as an action hero at this point of his career, no doubt because of his good work in ""Taken"". As a hero, he shows vulnerability instead of muscle. Diane Kruger appears as the Bosnian taxi driver who has her own problems, living illegally in Germany. One of the best things in the film is the casting of the supporting roles. The great Bruno Ganz turns as a former member of the hated East German Stasi, now working as a private investigator. Frank Langella does a wonderful appearance as the man who trains people to be assassins. January Jones has a small part as the wife of Martin. Sebastian Koch also shows as Prof. Bressler, the man holding something the bad guys want.<br/><br/>Flavio Labiano's photographs Berlin in autumn colors, even snow, taking the viewer to see some famous landmarks. The musical score is by John Ottman and Alexander Rudd."

And now he must find some connection to his real self and to prove himself. It's not so easy at it seems as even he is confused over the reality and what could be unreal due to his accident injuries. But soon he realizes that there is a daring mystery behind his lost ID.<br/><br/>Unknown is nothing equal to reality. But for the mere fact of thrill and mystery it is entertaining. Vaguely resembles Born Identity with a somewhat similar plot and action taking place in Europe. High speed car chases which stops at nothing and brutal hand to hand combat are big pluses in this thriller.<br/><br/>The plot is indeed interesting. However looses the grip a bit after the first half becoming more unrealistic. It's mysterious and makes the viewer to come to conclusions over small details yet prove them all wrong at the end. There are few good twists and some mundane moments as well.<br/><br/>Good performance by Liam Neeson portraying a confused intelligent man who is desperately trying to get back to his wife and his life. But this is not his best.

"honorhorror","5","1","3","5 June 2011"," Why did I figured out the plot of the movie at the very beginning......
","You know, if you are a big fan of espionage thrillers, don't watch this movie. That's because you will get the entire story figured out about 5 minutes into it.<br/><br/>I watched this film for the sake of Liam Nesson, who was ever impressive as tough guys with a tough voice. This is especially true in movies like Taken. When I first had my eyes on Unknown's poster, I had the feeling of Dejavu. But, since everything resembles Taken, that's not entirely a bad thing, right? Then I went into it expecting some bad-ass actions and a solid story. At the Berlin airport, when Liam Nesson's ""wife"" mockingly said the line ""giving the speech, seriously?"" I got the whole plot worked out. It's kinda sad to see how much your mindset is as clichéd as Hollywood wants you to be.<br/><br/>Then the entire movie played out as I expected. It almost seemed like the writer jumped out near the end saying, ""aha! You must haven't figured out some minor twists even if you worked out the main twist."" And I said like, ""That's exactly the kind of little twists I was expecting, and do you have any more tricks up your sleeve?"" Man, Liam Nesson in Taken was so cool, but in this one he's just like a little girl imitating Jason Bourne. If they could only smooth up some ridiculous romance and unconvincing character development, the movie would be more watchable. It must be a luxury compared to the budget of the film......<br/><br/>Although, Unknown was so devastatingly clichéd that it might inspire so many great parodies. Wait for those genius on the web to do so.<br/><br/>5/10."
"bigtimelover2001","7","1","3","26 May 2011"," Good entertainment
","One thing about Liam Neeson films is that they are guaranteed to be good. He's a fab actor and never fails to deliver, although his roles/acting seem more or less similar in every movie he's done lately playing a father, a husband etc except for his recent action flick. Nevertheless, he's a respectable actor who does a superb job. The movie 'unknown' was entertaining with a little drama, a little action and a bit of a thriller, nothing too over the top. It had a good twist toward the end which was very unpredictable and thus, likable. He, like with other films he's starred in, carried it on his shoulders till the end. With the exception of January Jones, who played his wife/partner assassin, the entire cast was excellent in terms of their performances. What I found very frustrating about January Jones was her expressionless and robotic face. Either she had a very straight bored look on her face while she delivered her dialogues or she had a broad smile in other scenes, just trying hard to look pretty on screen and this was it. I'd rate the movie more than 7 if it hadn't been for her. Over all, a decent story line with a good cast and some decent entertainment."
"raisleygordon","Null","1","3","8 April 2011"," Liam Neeson kicks butt overseas once again.
","Like his character in ""Taken"", Neeson plays a loving man who is looking to seek those who've done him wrong. Unlike his character in that movie, he is not looking for kidnappers, but those who might have something to do with the fact that his wife no longer remembers him after he had a terrible taxi crash. That's one thing the movie never explains: why is his wife the one who is acting crazy when she wasn't involved in the crash? Or was I missing something? Anyway, the movie is very effective, at least with the material we expect from a movie like this. What's new, or apparently new, is the former Stasi agent and this Nazi stuff. I could have done without this part. Frank Langella plays a character, who, it turns out, is not on his brother's side after all. This I did not see coming. Why he underplays it, I have no clue. I also enjoyed the last sequence in the hotel, where an alarm goes off, and now Neeson has to destroy a bomb from going off, and also to stop the guy who stole his identity. The way this fight plays out, it looks nothing (or at least almost nothing) like I've seen before.<br/><br/>*** out of ****"

","Well where do I start, the story had potential but got too muddled up towards the end, hard to see where the character ""Martin"" actually stood, good or bad? Predictability was also another issue, instantly seeing where the story was going when Martin arrived back to the Hotel after his accident. Constantly during the story I also felt that I had seen this before, quite similar in my opinion to ""The Bourne Trilogy"" with a mix of ""Taken"" in there, the originality just wasn't there in some parts.<br/><br/>Liam Neeson as the character ""Martin"" in my opinion couldn't have gone to a better actor, very convincing and excellent as always during fight/action scenes.<br/><br/>As for cinematography, some really great shots and angles within this film, much respect for DP Flavio Labiano. Sound I believe was flawless and editing was remarkable with the cross cutting of scenes from Martin's past.<br/><br/>All in all a good film but the final conclusion to the story really brought it down."

","Irrespective of a movie's subject matter if you can honestly say that you did not fidget or glance at your watch but sat intrigued for the duration then you have been entertained and what more can a film offer than that? Unknown is that kind of offering. The film has some very implausible moments the most memorable being the notion that you could somehow 'prep' a terrorist will sufficient knowledge in a highly technical subject to enable him to blend in with the other eggheads at a convention.However this is not an immediate distraction and represents the kind of flaws you talk about AFTER a film's conclusion. Someone said this was a typical Liam Neeson film and their probably right.Matt Damon is the only other actor that immediately comes to mind who embodies that look of both confusion and resilience to adversity. Neeson's ally in his battle against evil forces is the beautiful Diane Kruger who plays a rather unlikely looking immigrant taxi driver but then again there's nothing like an attractive woman to divert your mind from impossible scenarios. Enough criticism .... enjoy!"
"FilmFanatic03","6","1","3","12 March 2011"," It could have been more concise
","If you're expecting ""Taken 2"" then you may be disappointed. But even if we're not comparing it to ""Taken"" and judging it by its own right, i didn't feel that it had enough action in then what the trailer promised. I thought the plot was something different, unique and unpredictable. I had no idea what was going to happen which was really good as it kept you guessing and wondering how it will all work out. It had its moments of action and suspense, where you really paid attention and found it exciting, but i felt that there were many long, still moments which could have been shortened and the film could have been more concise. The characters were OK, nothing deep or Oscar worthy but good enough to keep you watching. Also, strangely enough, i felt that Liam Neeson didn't act to the best of his abilities, at times it was all shouting and no emotion, but it's Liam Neeson so you can't criticise him. Plus, they always say that an actor is as only as good as his script. A little more action, tension, on the run moments would have been nice to match the level of greatness of ""Taken"" (2008)"

","Liam Neeson is Dr Martin Harris, arriving in Berlin for some scientific thingie with hot wife January Jones. On returning to the airport to collect his forgotten briefcase, his taxi is in an accident. He wakes in hospital four days later with partial memory loss only to find, when he returns to his hotel, that Mrs Harris doesn't know him and there is another Mr Harris who, it appears, is the real one. The rest of the movie is devoted to him trying to prove who he is (with the assistance of illegal immigrant taxi driver Diane Kruger and ex-Stasi private detective Bruno Ganz), escaping various attempts to murder him, and discovering the truth (and the consequences of that discovery).<br/><br/>This paranoia action thriller potters along reasonably well, and the reveal towards the end does explain the puzzles generated in the set-up. The problem is that there are still about a million unanswered questions of the ""Yes, but if that's the case, then why didn't they...?"" Variety. The whole thing is vastly improbable, and the improbability is not helped by the fact that the film is incredibly po-faced - it takes itself far too seriously.<br/><br/>To some extent this is inevitable given that much of it rests on the broad back of a similar persona to the one Neeson set up in Taken (a much better film), but I can't help feeling that if the film had romped, and revelled in its romping, then it would have been a better film, for the lack of credibility would have mattered less."
"TheUnknown837-1","8","1","3","10 March 2011"," Director Jaume Collet-Serra structures and times his picture much like a jigsaw puzzle, appropriate given the plot scenario
","For a man who is almost in his sixties, Liam Neeson is sure keeping himself, and his career, in shape. He was immortalized for playing Oskar Schindler, the man who saved 1100 people during Nazi Germany, in Steven Spielberg's masterpiece ""Schindler's List"" but as of recently, has taken a nose-dive into the action/thriller genre. Since ""Batman Begins"" in 2005, he's been keeping our blood pumping with one terrific thriller after another. His latest pulse-raiser is ""Unknown"" which follows in the tradition of the Jason Bourne movies.<br/><br/>In the picture, Mr. Neeson plays Dr. Martin Harris, a scientist visiting Germany with his wife (January Jones) for a medical convention. Mr. Neeson is severely injured in a car accident, wakes up from a coma, only to find that nobody, not even his wife, has a clue of who he is. Without giving too much away, I will say that the plot of ""Unknown"" becomes bewilderingly preposterous and if you think about it for more than thirty seconds, you will pass it off as nonsense, which it is. However, the movie keeps on going and it's not until it's over that you start thinking about how ridiculously twist-stricken it was. During its 106-minute running time, against your better judgment, you buy it. Willingly.<br/><br/>""Unknown"" is the second Liam Neeson thriller in three years to place him in Europe. The former was ""Taken."" Both movies are similar in a lot of regards. And while ""Unknown"" does not have the heart of ""Taken"" it does have the same fast-cut pacing, earsplitting sound effects, and knowledge of how to stimulate the audience. Director Jaume Collet-Serra structures and times his picture much like a jigsaw puzzle, appropriate given the plot scenario. Mr. Neeson, almost always on-camera, delves into the mystery as do we. Had a lesser actor been placed in the lead role, ""Unknown"" might have spiraled away from conviction despite its other accolades. But because Mr. Neeson, one of our finest actors, is a master of staying in character and manufacturing characters that the audience goes for, he helps us really stay wrapped in what is happening.<br/><br/>There is not much else I can say about ""Unknown"" without giving away too much plot detail. And I don't want to do that, because that will spoil the fun and might deter you from going to see the movie. But this is one terrific thrill ride with a tremendously charismatic cast and some truly riveting action sequences.<br/><br/>In regards to the supporting cast -- Miss Jones as the leery wife, given her limited screen time, is believable regardless of what twists the plot throws her way. As the taxi driver who saves Mr. Neeson's life, Diane Kruger is her usual, in-character and charismatic self. (There is no love affair between them, I'm thankful to say -- tired old cliché). As the impostor, Aiden Quinn is sharp and venomous, Bruno Ganz is superb as the world-weary private eye, and Frank Langella shells out a marvelous performance as we near the third act."
"GManfred","Null","1","3","8 March 2011"," Coach, give me a shooter.
","That does it. This being basketball tournament season, I am calling a technical foul on the 'Unknown' bench for creating a confusing and convoluted screenplay designed to befuddle audiences and that is too clever by half. A scientist (but he's not) checks into a hotel with his wife (but she's not), gets into a car crash and becomes nobody. Got it so far? Didn't think so. From there on it gets confusing.<br/><br/>Before we get even farther afield, let's just say that the picture is saved by the charismatic presence of Liam Neeson, who plays his part with two of his best assets, his sincerity and his earnestness. He is aided in his earnest sincerity by two excellent performers, Bruno Ganz as a dying psychiatrist and by Frank Langella as the 'heavy'.<br/><br/>I guess it is worth seeing, and maybe you are quicker on the uptake than I am (I think it all started to come together on the way to the parking lot).There was just so much contrivance and improbability for a higher rating - but they at least had the right cast."

","I had two concerns before seeing this film: Will it be as good as Taken? and Has the trailer completely spoilt the reveals? I assumed No and Yes and still largely have that opinion. However, those pre-conceptions along with less than generous critical reviews thankfully managed to down-play my expectations and all-in-all I'm glad because I really enjoyed this film.<br/><br/>It harks back to post-Hitchcockian thrillers that I've enjoyed immensely in the past and which don't seem to get made these days, such as Polanski's Frantic.<br/><br/>I had read that it was formulaic and predictable, well, formaulic is fine so long as it is delivered well which this certainly is and anyway this genre is largely unrepresented (in my opinion) today so any good representation is to be welcomed.<br/><br/>As for predictable...? I didn't sit there trying to resolve the puzzle and even if I had, I'm not so sure I would have done so before the narrative revealed all. As such, I was entranced by the piecing together of it all.<br/><br/>Genre & formula aside, Liam Neeson is in Taken territory in terms of passion, confussion & anger whilst the choreography of action & tension is slick and impressively paced throughout: gear-changing car-chases, street-running evasions and psychological check-mates.<br/><br/>One final point, I liked the film's genuine tho subtle attempt to highlight social liberal issues such as free market ethnic labour exploitation and the hope that science can be motivated by ethics rather than profit.<br/><br/>If you like the appeal of this film, I believe you will enjoy it plentifully."

Its a bit like 'Frantic' but more action based although not as over the top action as 'Taken'. The always earnest Liam Neeson is a good central figure. Diane Kruger is really getting to be a very good actress - totally believable and with just the right amount of European accent to be understandable. January Jones is the ideal beautiful good icy Hitchcock blonde. Good to see Aidan Quinn in a big movie again. Good satisfying storyline that doesn't confuse or have silly red herrings.

Proper music, proper color temperature for the atmoshpere, good camera angles, and nice pacing into the story which follows throughout.

","An interesting and compelling idea for a film that is extremely well acted yet doesn't deliver on the narrative side. Unknown follows a couple in Berlin, Dr. Martin Harris, played by Liam Neeson, and Elizabeth Harris, played by the jaw-dropping January Jones. Martin is a scientist and is in Berlin to speak at a Bio Tech Summit and his wife is just tagging along. When they arrive at the hotel, Martin realizes that he left his briefcase at the airport with his passport in it. He hails a cab with Diane Kruger driving and on the way there gets in an accident and is in a coma for four days. When Martin awakes and finally finds his wife, she doesn't know who he is, another Martin Harris is with her that she says is her husband and he can not provide any real ID that says he's Martin Harris. What's nice here is that this all happens within 15 minutes after the opening credits. There's no time wasted on developing the problem and thus creating suspense and fear from the start. From here he tries to figure out what's going on, is he crazy? is there something more going on?, while also believing he is being followed. I don't want to say much more than that at this point because I don't want to give anything away.<br/><br/>The cast is great here. Liam Neeson is good no matter what role he's doing (well maybe not Zeus), and he's in familiar territory here playing a much tamer version of his role from Taken. I haven't seen much of January Jones, well I haven't seen much of her acting I guess is more appropriate, but after this I am very excited to check out Mad Men as well as being that much more pumped to see the new X-Men. Diane Kruger plays the cab driver that crashes and causes Martin's coma, however she becomes an integral character further in the storyline. As for Langella, he plays one of Martin's friends that could potentially help him provide proof of his identity, but he only really shows up for about 15 minutes towards the end of the film. It's a very strong cast but it loses itself in the pacing and narrative of the story itself.<br/><br/>The director, Jaume Collet-Serra, is a little over his head on this one, with some of his past credits including the remake of House of Wax and Orphan. He does do a very nice job in the first half of the film showing the anxiety and fear of Martin not knowing if he really is Martin while being in an unfamiliar location. Where he fails is through his pacing. The film feels very boring and somewhat predictable (which could accredited more to the trailer, I pretty much had it figured it out from the previews and that should never happen). The action scenes are few and far between and don't really deliver. There is one decent car chase scene and the final fight scene is very well done and a lot of fun to watch, but others are just forgettable. Then in between the action scenes Collet-Serra slows it down too much with the mystery part of the story instead of trying to make the it more suspenseful with the answer slowing coming to be. Instead he hits you with the solution all in one scene and to be honest I was a little let down by it. I feel like it was pretty anti-climatic but that's all I can really say without giving anything away.<br/><br/>The idea behind the story is very interesting and could be extremely compelling but it just wasn't delivered very well here. The first act is exciting and full of what the hell is going on moments but after that it's pretty weak until the finale. Also, some of the scenes are very reminiscent of Taken and makes me think that they are just trying to get in on the Taken money. I mean its Liam Neeson, in a foreign country, looking for answers and fighting a bunch of people in between. It not quite worth the theater admission but worth the wait for Blu-ray/DVD, right around the time when you'll forget the trailers that showed way too much information. But if you're a fan of a good mystery and a Neeson fan I recommend it. You might be slightly bored in the middle part of the film, but just remember that January Jones will be back on screen momentarily."

On another note, I also like Liam Neeson as the protagonist (he's a great actor.<br/><br/>The beginning was a bit slow, but it still added the momentum that was required for a thriller movie. It kept me questioning how Liam Neeson will regain his memory, who were those guys that chased him, why was his 'wife' acting different in certain scenes and what was his true identity.<br/><br/>The pacing of the movie was very well done just until he found out that he was a killer. One of the only few evidences that I can recall from the movie before his identity was revealed to the audience was when he remembered the exact lines as 'Martin Harris'. Other than that there were no clues that the protagonist was a killer that partnered up with his lover and not his wife. Also, I didn't understand why he changed 180 degrees (not enough characterization to back up). He also got away with his past crimes for free!<br/><br/>Personally, I thought they should have added smarter clues so that when we rewind the movie, we can go ""ahh"". There was nothing to suggest that he was a killer."
"imdb2-556-923983","8","1","3","28 February 2011"," ""Frantic"". Not ""Taken"".
","I went to see Unknown after reading some baffling mixed reviews here. Some were saying the movie is horrid and just like ""Taken"", others were saying that it's wonderful and nothing like ""Taken"". To me the very analogy was disturbing, as I think ""Taken"" is a bad shoot-em-up video-game pretending to be a movie. Well, for my money, the only commonality between the two movies is their poster. (Neeson, side-facing, gun-toting, grave and menacing -- the resemblance is uncanny, and obviously not accidental. Were the producers trying to capitalize on the success(?) of that train-wreck??)<br/><br/>The movie that one SHOULD make comparisons to, but that requires a tad better cinematic memory, is Roman Polanski's classic ""Frantic"". See if you can spot the differences: a doctor and his wife visit a foreign city they are unfamiliar with and where they do not speak the language. Soon after they land, something drastic happens, and the two get separated, after which most of the movie is spent with the doctor trying to figure out what happened to his wife. Police are turned to, but to no avail, as he cannot corroborate his own story. Help comes from an unlikely source: a kooky local girl with an obvious crush on the married, older man. She invites him to her small apartment and from there starts a chase on roof-tops, in cars, and through disorienting night-clubs, at the end of which our protagonist finds that the key to all events lies in something he had all along. Once that is cleared up, and reality once again makes sense, the third act is then dedicated to killing bad guys and getting away with a moderately happy ending. Any of that sounds familiar?<br/><br/>With that comparison in mind, under Polanski's direction Paris is grittier than Collet-Serra's Berlin, and Liam Neeson, though widely-recognized as a fine actor, doesn't bring to the role the intensity that Harrison Ford does. Ford's character is jet-lagged, exhausted, flabbergasted, enraged, and frankly at the end of its wits. Neeson's doctor doesn't even come close. The entire movie Unknown is less a grab-you-by-the-throat thriller and more of a joy-ride. The doctor is only matinée-level enraged, the girl is only PG-kooky, and the moderately-happy ending is more of a crowd-pleaser. All these traits probably make Unknown into a more box-office-friendly movie than Frantic, but I don't think 23 years from now I'll have any recollection that I ever saw it. Frantic, on the other hand, is a cinema classic.<br/><br/>The big stand-out here is Frank Langella, bringing to his performance every inch of the intensity Neeson is lacking. His one joint scene with ""Jurgen"" (Bruno Ganz) is unforgettable.<br/><br/>Regarding the ending: don't expect too much and you won't be disappointed. After having seen the trailer I wrote down to myself what I thought the big reveal is going to be, and I was right. The fact that this twist can literally be spotted a mile away, however, does not detract from its charm. The script provides ample and effective misdirection, and at no point did I feel cheated.<br/><br/>So, bottom line: If you're looking for cinematic genius, you're barking up the wrong tree. But if you want a fun movie, go see it. Have fun. I know I did."
"antoniotierno","6","1","3","28 February 2011"," intriguing though extremely unlikely
","It's an interesting kind of nightmare, a spy-versus-spy movie, with good acting, good cast and decent action sequences (especially the underwater rescue and the spectacular car chase). Fans of Liam Neeson will find a likeness with ""Taken"" and will probably like Lim's character with his fight scenes - in spite of the catchphrase and quips. Given that ""Unknown"" is not special at all, although there are famous actors like Neeson, Jones and Diane Kruger, in addition to nice sights. Nothing about Unknown is exceptional, most of it isn't bad - it only purports to show a moral which it actually doesn't have. It's been marketed as a smart thriller, whereas it's more a thug movie presented as James Bond like story. What certainly this film doesn't lack is the action and suspense."
"jdesando","Null","1","3","22 February 2011"," A nice little thriller
","""Mr. Hopkins, after all, was an axiom of the Merchant-Ivory glory days, in addition to embodying Hannibal Lecter and Richard Nixon. Mr. Neeson, for his part, having played the American sexologist Alfred Kinsey and the Irish revolutionary Michael Collins and given voice to Aslan, the Messianic lion of Narnia, sits squarely at the top of his profession. What are actors of such prestige and pedigree doing in pictures like these?"" A.O. Scott, NYT, ""When good actor meets bad movie"" <br/><br/>Neeson can be forgiven for Unknown, a taut thriller with twists good enough to surprise and characterization believable enough to overcome plot holes endemic to all high-octane thrillers. Granted he's again looking for a lost family member, as he did with his daughter in Taken and this time his wife, Elizabeth (January Jones), but he is such a good actor of such strength that we believe him implicitly even when his sanity and truthfulness can be legitimately questioned. As Scott says in the above New York Times commentary, these great actors participate in at-best ""B"" movies at this time of year because they can, and they bring a gravity of commitment that supersedes weak material.<br/><br/>Presenting at a Berlin biotech conference, Dr. Martin Harris (Neeson) is separated from his wife only to discover himself in a situation where he loses his identity and she denies him. Director Jaume Collet-Serra slowly distributes the information before we begin to understand the loss of identity and wife. With its Harrison Ford-Fugitive feel about the chases, at no early point was I sure what the biotech conference had to do with the assassination of an oil prince or Harris's role in the plot.<br/><br/>The theme of lost identity is neatly woven into the suspense. It may be I identify with the fear as a traveler who guards his passport with his life, but the film plays on the current techno-terror of identity theft be it at an airport or over the Internet. In any case, Neeson is believable as a man driven almost to madness by the thought that someone has taken his life along with his wife.<br/><br/>The introduction of a young cab driver, Gina (Diane Kruger), who saves Harris's life, adds adventure that doesn't detract from the believability. An inspiration of casting is Bruno Ganz as Ernst Jurgen, a private investigator with a checkered past but a lifelong interest in the details that make a difference. Ganz, a German actor of substance for decades, brings energy to his role that leaps over others for powerful screen presence, albeit with almost over-the-top glee.<br/><br/>At this dead time of year, when Oscar winners dominate, this little thriller is welcome even if its theme scares the heck out of me."

Massed with a lot of positive audience reviews, and praising Liam for his role, well into the film he isn't the problem.<br/><br/>Overall, Unknown is quite decent but one expected better and a better ending and overall twist, given the constant praise the film had received.

"Otterman_MK2","7","1","4","5 April 2011"," Taking the Unknown Identity.
","Having loved Liam Neeson in Taken I would have been mad to have missed this. Having seen it, it's not hard to notice the film felt like a mixture of The Bourne movies and Taken. Despite this, the film stood firmly on it's own two feet as a solid and enjoyable action movie.<br/><br/>Prior to seeing this I was worried Liam Neeson would play the part of the protagonist (Dr. Martin Harris) too similarly to the one he played in Taken, but this was not the case at all. Although he still plays a character who has excellent skills in combat, Martin Harris is a victim who has lost quite literally everything and must fight in order to take it back. Neeson clearly depicts this to the audience, making you sympathise with his desperate situation and personally I wanted to help him find out what happened.<br/><br/>The film felt like a journey of steady progression towards finding the truth behind his apparent memory loss, but it is far from an easy journey as whenever Harris comes to some sort of logical answer, he is tripped up either by armed henchman breaking down the door and chasing him through the streets, betrayal, and unexpected turns in the plot. It is understandable if some viewers would become frustrated by this, but I found it increased the tension building towards the end of the film.<br/><br/>The ending itself was not too surprising, but rather a logical answer that made sense. I am glad, however, the writers chose this approach over a far more confusing and possibly over-the-top ending. I felt satisfied with what I had seen and believed the approach to be necessary, even if it was not over-whelming.<br/><br/>With some great shots of Berlin, tense and fun action scenes it is a solid experience, even if this concept has been used before. I don't know much about the making of the film, but it is likely they used 'The Bourne Identity' as a starting point. But don't let this put you off this brilliant entertainer!"

This one is touched by some nostalgia with a special focus on East Berlin. Friedrichstrasse Bahnhof, the entering station of East Berlin, a little bit of Unter den Linden, next door, and then the Brandenburg Tor on the East side essentially, the East German TV tower on Alexandra Platz, the Hohenzollern Palace' rebuilt after the fall of the wall, and an ex-Stasi agent, and some survivors of the Cold War, terrorist style from the West. We just miss the Karl Marx Allee and the Vopos (Volkspolizei for the younger generation who never met them) of course. I guess East Berlin is cheaper for film makers than West Berlin. Then the whole thing is wrapped up in some kind of nice pieces of ideological good will. The Stasi commits suicide on the screen. The brutal Serbs are killed one by one and one after another. The Arab prince is a nice-looking nearly Caucasian young chap and he is supporting western science. The scientists are developing a new type of maize that will grow in the desert and will kill all insects five hundred miles around and the NGOs are even said - or is it told? - to approve it, and it is true the ecological zombies have been made scarce. The only negative point is that the terrorists are plain criminal hit men paid by the agricultural industry to kill the scientist and steal his files. And all that goes down the chute because of a weirdo professional killer who loses his memory and his mind. Superb! Well, people my age can always get some kicks out of the little bits of East Berlin they remember when the Stasi was everywhere.

","Dr. Martin Harris (Liam Neeson) has just landed in Berlin with his beautiful wife (January Jones) to attend a biotechnology submit. While at the airport, Harris accidentally leaves his briefcase on the luggage cart. Unaware of his actions, him and his wife get into their taxi and head for the hotel. Once they arrive, Harris realizes that his briefcase is missing and informs his wife to check into the hotel, while he searches the cab for his briefcase. With no luck, he grabs the first taxi and heads back to the airport with the hope of retrieving his briefcase. This is when this happy story takes a turn for the worst because the taxi swerves to avoid an accident and lands in a river. As the taxi collides off of a bridge, Harris bangs his head on the window and slips into a coma. Three days later, he awakes in a hospital with a foggy memory of the events that lead him to the hospital. Harris ventures out into Berlin to find his wife, only to find out that his wife as well as everyone else has no recollection of who he is. This is when he sets out to prove to everyone that he is, in fact, Dr. Martin Harris. A smart and edgy thriller ensues...<br/><br/>I felt the same way that everyone else did when I first saw the trailer for ""Unknown."" The movie looked a lot like ""Taken"" and when I went into the film, I really was expecting that. The great news is that, while the film takes place in another country just like in ""Taken,"" the rest of the film is nothing like it. The story that takes place in ""Unknown"" has nothing to do with the one that occurs in ""Taken"" so get that out of your head now. I have read several reviews trying to compare the two films but as I said they have next to nothing in common. ""Taken"" was an action film from start to finish with very little story. ""Unknown"" is more of a suspense thriller with a solid story that is loaded with twists.<br/><br/>My question, however, is this, when did Liam Neeson become box office gold? I am not saying that in a negative way, because I always admired the man as an actor but after ""Taken"" his rise of stardom has grown ten-fold. Neeson, who has always had a wide array of talent, seems to be able to play every role from romantic comedies to a bad ass assassins. Neeson, has been acting since 1979 and has now found his market playing the lead role in such films as ""Taken"" and ""Unknown."" I guess to answer my own question is that Neeson became a huge star when he took on the genre of action thriller. What I like most about Neeson is that he has no problem going from nice guy to a complete bad ass in just a few scenes. The reason ""Unknown"" works as well as it does is because of Neeson in the lead role. He is believable throughout the entire film and his struggle to prove his identity feels real.<br/><br/>There are many scenes in ""Unknown,"" where the audience may have to sustain some belief in order to follow the story. This sadly is the cliché of Hollywood to create unrealistic action scenes to keep the audience involved. The film, however, didn't need those scenes to work but seemed to be added to keep people who enjoy this genre happy. The thriller is a genre that leaves its audience at the edge of its seat. This film accomplishes this pretty early on and runs with it through the entire film. Once you get into the story, you are hooked or at least I was.<br/><br/>The simple idea of someone's identity being stolen is a subject that has always intrigued audiences. The topic itself has been done before several times and most films that have tackled the subject don't leave us with a good taste in our mouths. We live in an era where identity theft is a regular occurrence, therefore, allowing the viewer to truly understand what Harris is feeling. The best part of the film is simply the fact that the story doesn't just stop at a stolen identity topic but adds an interesting twist that keeps the film's audience wanting more. The pace of ""Unknown"" as well as the better than average storyline is what makes it stand out from other films that feature the whole ""stolen identity"" plot. The introduction of new characters as the story advances also helps the storyline built more suspense. Each new character introduces unravels another piece of the puzzle that ""Unknown"" sets us up to put together.<br/><br/>With films like ""Unknown"" doing well at the box office, I am happy to report that movie-goers may actually want films that actually try to make them think. While this movie has its normal action packed scenes, which feature unbelievable car chase sequences, the story is where it really stands out. ""Unknown"" may be a thriller that is made for a mainstream audience but it has enough there to keep a person who expects more from cinema to be happy. It's not a masterpiece by any definition but is definitely is one of the better thrillers with a solid story to come out of Hollywood in years. I think if Liam Neeson keeps it up, in a few more years he may actually make it to the big leagues to where people like Tom Cruise once sat. When watching ""Unknown"" please remember its not a sequel to ""Taken"" but rather a smart, edge of your seat thriller that will leave you feeling refreshed.<br/><br/>MovieManMenzel's final rating for ""Unknown"" is a 8 out of 10. This is one of the better action/suspense thrillers to come out of Hollywood in years."

","Neeson works well in these European Thrillers, it is hard to categorise these films, they are part mystery, part action, part car chases. And that's what makes these European films work, like 2008's ""Taken"". The Berlin backdrop along with veteran actors like Frank Langella and Bruno Ganz work with the mystery and action elements to give a fairly good romp through Germany. January Jones and Aiden Quinn, as well as Diane Kruger also do some good character work in this.<br/><br/>I'll have to admit, I was not really expecting the turns this story took, and that is what makes a good film for me, if I can't predict it, it keeps my interest. Plenty to keep my interest in this, Actually the entire plot of this film from the beginning to almost the end is nothing but a huge 'Hitchcock-MacGuffin', the reveal of which is pretty drastic.<br/><br/>Car Chases have interesting twists, and the choice of locations make this a great looking film.<br/><br/>Like ""Taken"", this film incorporates veteran American actors in a European Setting, along with veteran German actors, Bruno Ganz is always great to watch, and several newer faces, among them Diane Kruger who has already proved her worth in ""Inglorious Basterds"" and ""National Treasure"" as well as a memorable cameo in one episode of Fringe, she earns her place in this film, she did her role well - Not being the Hapless, Helpless Female, her character takes the initiative, because she takes the initiative.<br/><br/>There is nothing else really special about this film, it is a good film, written and directed well, and I will be watching out for Jaume Collet-Serra in the near future. Sometimes a film does not have to be spectacular to be great, but this film does have some great things to see in it, and I'm glad I watched it."

","""Unknown"" is based on the French book ""Out of My Head"" written by Didiar van Cauwelaert. The film brings a very diverse all-star cast to the table including January Jones (""Mad Men""), Diana Kruger (""Troy"", ""National Treasure""), Frank Langella (Best Actor Nomination, ""Frost/Nixon"") and most importantly Liam Neeson (""Schindler's List"", ""Taken""). Neeson appeared in seven films last year ranging from ""The A-Team"" to ""The Chronicles of Narnia: The Voyage of the Dawn Treader"" exemplifying his popularity and acting ability in Hollywood. Therefore, because of his vast repertoire of flicks, Liam Neeson is in very familiar territory with his newest character Dr. Martin Harris. The viewer is greeted with Harris going to a medical conference in Berlin with his wife Elizabeth Harris (January Jones), but as he is about to enter the hotel he realizes that he left one of his bags at the airport. Without telling his wife, he jumps in a cab driven by a woman named Gina (Diana Kruger) and heads back to the airport. Chaos is set free when an unavoidable car accident throws the cab off of a bridge into water below. Gina gets away injury free after saving Martin's life. However, Martin was not so lucky. After being in a coma for a few days, Martin does not remember where he is or who he is. While investigating, his wife denies knowing him, bringing up questions of conspiracy in a movie that is impossible for a viewer to figure out until the end.<br/><br/>Originality definitely isn't a problem for this film because of its vast ambiguity. Therefore, that aspect will not disappoint those looking for an original film. The problem is that the only other things good about the film are the performances of Diane Kruger, Frank Langella, the awkwardly enjoyable performance of Bruno Ganz (Founder of Schaubuehne Theater Company in Berlin), and Liam Neeson, who obviously led the show. The reason why Liam Neeson is an A-list actor is his ability to play very balanced roles. He always goes as far as he can with a role without overdoing it making him relevant and believable.<br/><br/>""Unknown"" tries way too hard to be ambiguous and original therefore creating an ending that just isn't that spectacular. Too many twists and turns send the plot into completely opposite directions. The only things logical about the movie are the performances within it. Otherwise the film ends leaving numerous loose ends and meaningless plot tangents, causing a lot of things in the film to remain ""unknown."" Not to mention the fact that the action aspect of the film is completely forgotten, making the film boring and dull.<br/><br/>The movie lacks the thrill factor because of endless twists failing to be followed by fast paced, heart pounding action. Therefore, ""Unknown"" is ""The Bourne Series"" meets the lengthy, longwinded Tolstoy novel ""War and Peace""."

"zardoz-13","6","1","8","20 February 2011"," A Lukewarm Amnesia Thriller With Too Many Complications
","Liam Neeson looks like the new Harrison Ford in ""Orphan"" director Jaume Collet-Serra's movie ""Unknown,"" a lukewarm amnesia thriller set in Berlin about a biophysicist who loses his memory in a car accident. The people who produced ""Unknown"" probably never saw a potboiler called ""Frantic"" that Ford made in 1988 for notorious Polish helmer Roman Polanski. Ford played an American doctor whose wife is kidnapped when he attends a medical conference in Paris. Predictably, the French police are too incompetent to help. Instead, Ford turns to a young single girl who lives on the fringe. She guides him through the Parisian underworld to find the kidnappers. In ""Unknown,"" Neeson plays an American doctor who loses his memory after his taxi plunges off a bridge into a river and he nearly drowns. The female taxi driver at the wheel when the accident occurred saves his life. Afterward, she vanishes without a trace. Neeson spends four days in a coma as a result of the accident. When he recovers, he leaves the hospital against his doctor's advice. Neeson gets the surprise of his life when he confronts his wife. First, she doesn't recognize him. Second, another man is posing as her husband! Neeson relies on an illegal immigrant to navigate Berlin so he can elude the omnipotent villains. There is as much Robert Ludlum as there is Alfred Hitchcock in this PG-13 exercise in suspense and intrigue. ""Frantic"" fell frantically flat, and ""Unknown"" fares moderately better. Anybody hoping that ""Unknown"" would rival Neeson's earlier actioneer ""Taken"" should prepare themselves for a letdown. Despite a number of narrative surprises and Neeson's sincere performance as a hero caught up in a vast web of conspiracy, ""Unknown"" lacks the charisma and catharsis that made ""Taken"" such a crackerjack thriller.<br/><br/>Dr. Martin Harris (Liam Neeson of ""Batman Begins"") and his wife Elizabeth (January Jones of ""Anger Management"") arrive in snowy Berlin for a biotechnology summit. The wealthy Prince Shada (Mido Hamada of ""Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow"") and Professor Bressler (Sebastian Koch of ""Black Book"") are sponsoring the summit that will yield a scientific innovation to halt world hunger. Security is tight because terrorists have tried to kill Prince Shada. When Harris and his wife show up at the motel, he discovers he is missing his brief case. Martin leaves Elizabeth to register at the front desk, while he catches a cab back to the airport to retrieve the case. The briefcase contains Harris' passport and other valuables. The trip back to the airport turns out to be a little more exciting than our hero thought. A truck transporting a refrigerator loses the appliance. Harris' cab driver Gina (Diane Kruger of ""Inglourious Basterds"") swerves to avoid the fridge. The cab careens wildly, crashes through a bridge and plunges into a river. Gina smashes the rear window of the cab and rescues Harris. Harris lies in a coma that for four days. When he awakens, Harris is desperate to reach his wife. Unfortunately, Harris has no identification. Worse, he is suffering from a case of amnesia.<br/><br/>Eventually, Harris recovers his wits sufficiently to discharge himself from the hospital. Imagine his surprise when he walks into the conference and learns that another man, Martin Harris (Aidan Quinn of ""Legends of the Fall""), is impersonating him. Harris erupts with fury initially but then has the good sense to back off before the Berlin police arrest him. He returns to the hospital, and an assassin tries to murder him after killing a nurse. Miraculously, Harris escapes from his assailants and searches for the cab driver who can prove his identity. The complication here is that Gina is an illegal Bosnian immigrant without a passport. Moreover, she wants nothing to do with Harris. Later, she changes her mind and lets him shower at her cramped apartment. Things change quickly as a ruthless pair of killers show up to silence him. Harris hires a former Stasi officer-turned-private investigator, Ernst Jürgen (Bruno Ganz of ""Downfall""), to help him sort things out. Harris is flabbergasted that he cannot prove his identity to anybody and the language barrier doesn't mitigate his madness. He relies on Gina to get him around the city and translate for him.<br/><br/>""Unknown"" is not as good as Collet-Serra's ""Orphan,"" but it far surpasses his anemic ""House of Wax"" remake. The surprise-laden screenplay by ""Dr. Jekyll and Ms. Hyde"" scribe Oliver Butcher and ""Killing Streets"" scenarist Stephen Comwell, derived from French author Didier Van Cauwelaert's novel ""Out of My Head,"" strains believability at every turn. The Neeson character behaves like an imbecile when he loses his briefcase at the airport and later Professor Bressler is just as idiotic when he allows a woman to take his laptop away from him so she can copy his ultra-secret files. Eventually, when the assassins come after our hero, they make it obvious that they are after him. Our hero suspects that he is being shadowed in the Berlin subway. His suspicions are confirmed when a bespectacled stranger pursues him at a run. Mind you, Harris' assailant could have quietly sidled up beside him and killed the hero without arousing his suspicions. Collet-Serra and his writer spend most of their 113 minutes trying to distract us from the obvious. The surprise ending raises more questions than it resolves, and you'll feel cheated instead of astonished. Ultimately, ""Unknown"" amounts to a half-baked synthesis of ""The Bourne Identity"" and ""Shutter Island."""

The doctor who fight, so stupid director:/
Than car chasing scene. Typical and stupid as an American movie scene:/ It was bad to see:/
Doctor just got out from coma and fights, driving car in Berlin what He never saw.<br/><br/>And stupid dramaturg wants us to believe the bad guys car go different way but shows up right next to them.
So bad useless driving around Berlin. Completely idiot who directed that action.<br/><br/>And after all trouble the car still drivable?! And all of them walk away?!<br/><br/>And by the way how they find Liam all the time?! He has hidden gps tracker in his brain?! Its so lame and childish.<br/><br/>I was happy to see the start, it was interesting why they doubled, but this movie only have the good idea of this one thing, Dr Martin Harris (Liam) has a double somehow who also claim He is him.
That is the only good thing until the last twist what also brolliant. But the rest is flat cliché.<br/><br/>I regret to see this destruction of a good idea:/<br/><br/>Already bored when I seen the half of this film. Than two old spy meet scene, 'the communist spy swallows cyanide' wtf??!
American Cliché from 60's.
Could not believe this film can get any lower, but it did.<br/><br/>Happy to see the end twist when they tell the truth, Matrin (Liam) just forgot he is an assasin and Martin just a cover story for him.
That is only the second good idea.
I cant be happy so long because a stupid action scene make me loosne my interest again.
And the falling car goes on flames without any reason. Why cars have to catch fire in US movies?<br/><br/>Of course the professional assasination team has a bag with them filled with script and original (or other fake) passports?
Why should they carry that with them?<br/><br/>At the cloak room she put ""secretly"" a pandrive in a laptop. More like stupidly. Visible, and should not be planned like this. How she knows usb port is on that side of his laptop? And why sure the laptop is with him? And what if the laptopnhas no power? That was not realistic at all. Why not the cloak girl put that stupid pendrive there when they leave? Problem solved, realistic, and professional.<br/><br/>In Hollywood movies bombs have to make sound also, and we have to see a timer. Why? Why they do that in Hollywood?<br/><br/>At the same time when this sound making huge timer bomb counts down, Liam sneaks is, but Im not sure how, and try to tell there is a bomb. Well its two mistake here.
First, when he claims there is a bomb they have to take seriously, but they not take him as they think he is the crazy guy from yesterday.
Ok, buy why they start to check 3 months old video records? Why they do what mr america say?<br/><br/>Happy to see bomb exploded.
After boom Liam got his head banged but He strong enough to fight no matter explosion and head injury.<br/><br/>I regret to watch this film.
Too long and too flat.
Could be a good short film in 35-45 minutes. Waste of time and money"

","Film is definitely not boring and full of curiosity till 75% of its run time. Story is almost same as Taken but with different plot line. But Liam's ability to live up to the hype and expectation which people have set upon him with the Taken is quite brilliant. He completely nails the character this time as well. <br/><br/>Dark and gloomy environment has suited the film story and also acts as a metaphor for the mind state of the main character. This is a mystery and a thriller which the viewer and the main character both get lost at the beginning and later learns the identity step by step keeping the suspense till the last discovery. <br/><br/>No explicit fights or nude scenes which is an indication that the director is more focused on the main story/plot. The success is depicted with the way story is unfolded.<br/><br/>A good one to watch and entertain yourselves. I rate this 6 as i find this very similar to Taken and most parts of Taken is acting like ghosts inside this film as well."

","I decided to watch this movie because it had Liam, the Harrison ford of the second millennium, the cute Kruger and a change of locations with Berlin. In addition, the story sounded like a mystery. Now, the result is average, not totally awful but not worthy of a second watch. I have never went there and maybe it's due to winter time but this Berlin looks a cold, industrial city that surely don't have the beauty of Paris or London Then, i didn't understand why Kruger doesn't play a German girl ?? About the plot, it's a sort of reboot of « frantic » : same professor, same hunt in a foreign country, same companies game, same help from a young woman, same little flat Maybe the difference is the twist but there, there is a lot of inspiration from « XIII ». The action sequences are maybe well orchestrated but they are totally unbelievable, especially the car chase ! At the end, my last question is why it's a french movie when everything and everyone aren't not french ???"

The movie raises the expectations of the audience but the payoff is crap. The mystery resolves itself in a manner which is a copy of/inspiration from the Bourne movies among many others. When you look back at the 105 minutes they seem like a complete waste because overall the movie does not offer anything new and treads on the old, tested landscape. 2 out of 5 for this disappointment."

","Very exciting film. I am particularly fond of 'european' touch and atmosphere presented, being living in the eastern Europe, film looked very domestic and familiar. Instead of skyscrapers, you find miniature flats with ""carton walls"" and modest middle-class cars on the street; hearing authentic language and behaving dialogs on the glimpse; the set is ready, turn-on the camera, please. The story was original up to a fair point, and kept all of my attention throughout entire film. The acting of a lead actor is natural as always, and supporting characters are also good, although pushed into a second plan; with no artificial kindness of any sort in between (Gina: ""Why did you have to be in my Taxi!?""; or Ernst:""The Money!"").<br/><br/>The 4-day vacuum, gloomy outlook for the lead and general suspense were dominant feelings for less then 2 hours of a great adventure.

","Quite an amazing script this one... The movie starts intriguing, but while the movies moves on, the script becomes more and more unbelievable. In the end it is about a corn formula that will save the world from starvation. And this is of course bad for the bad guys. So the professor who invented it has to die. He keeps his formula only on his laptop, so this laptop needs to be destroyed... a world saving formula is stored only on a laptop, and not on a server or in the cloud, amazing, isn't it? But there are some nice special effects, and the cast is quite good, but in fact the acting is pretty bad (especially Neeson). Only the German professor (yes, the same one as in Zwartboek) was acting naturally, but he did not get that many lines. Sorry, but this movie was a disappointment for me. If the script is not believable, the movie falls apart in my view."

","I went to see Unknown at the theater on opening night in February of 2011. I would like to say first of all, I don't agree with those haters of this movie, I thought it was a great movie even though there were some factual errors, Hollywood is not perfect, far from it, LOL :D. I think what drew me to the movie was the plot; it was an exciting movie; and a HELL of a lot better than TAKEN, which was one of the worst Neeson films I saw. This movie had it all, excitement, suspense, and plot twists. I am surprised by the negative views of the movie, to me it was great, it kept you guessing until the end of the film; and I didn't find the plot confusing at all. The only surprise of the movie was Neeson's true identity, that was shocking. I thought the cast was excellent; and the ending wasn't a tragic one. In the end it worked out for Neeson; and it felt good for the viewer that Neeson changed his ways and was going to do a 360 with his life.. He would begin a new life, with his friend that helped him find his way out of his personal hell. This movie is a true winner of 2011 for the whole family, hardly any profanity; especially sex which can ruin a great film. This movie is worth watching more than once; and it's a great addition to your video library.<br/><br/>THX, Kris L. CocKayne-abucki4ever71- GO BUCKIS :)"

The way that the character Liam Neeson plays of trying to find out who he really is, has an interesting vibe to it that keeps you on the edge of your seat, wondering what's going to happen next. Plus, the action scenes they show is well shot, and gives you that adrenalin rush that good actions films give us. Not to mention, the twist at the end, is purely amazing, and it explains the confusion that anyone who sees this film gets. So, if you like Liam Neeson and/or action dramas, this movie is for you."

","Just to clarify, this is a psychological action thriller film. In my opinion, this movie should have had less ""action"" and more ""thriller"". Related to this is the fact that I know Liam Neeson plays a great positive character but I really don't buy him as an action guy. Maybe it's just me because when I told people I was going to watch a movie called ""Unknown"" starring Liam Neeson in the main role, they were like:""It's an action film right?"". And that is not because they had heard of the movie. I was happy to see that this movie isn't all about action.<br/><br/>Moving on to more important stuff, the movie was directed by Jaume Collet-Serra. He is an inexperienced Spanish director. Apart from this he has directed only 3 movies:""House of Wax""(the only one worth mentioning, but anyway), ""Goal 2: Living the Dream"" and ""Orphan"". And considering this, I thought he did a great job directing this. Also the script is actually good, except the lines from the action parts. Another positive thing is that for 3 quarters of this film, I knew how it was going to end. I have to say, I was pleasantly surprised by how the ending turned out.<br/><br/>A thing that I really disliked was the fact that they put Frank Langella in the main cast. If you look it up on any site you see his name over there among the main actors. I was thrilled to see him in this movie but...HE PRACTICALLY HAS A CAMEO APPEARANCE.

I will not go to a movie where the overpaid stars look like busboys who spend time in the gym rather than grooming their talents. The best entertainment is on Cable with actors in series like DEXTER, and HOMELAND and the film industry is suffering from remakes or kid flicks for dunderheads and film students. Luckily, the AFI is restoring some unseen films which come on at 3AM but have dialog and story lines which are fantastic when there were some fine writers with talent. Most film goers and film critics are the types who look for ""goofs"" and mistakes for the trivia section of reviews here.Called iPadists. Currently, I am hooked on German cinema which is magnificent compared to our ""dramas"" and action films. We will be making Mid-Eastern-spy-bomb-torture-Al Quaeda-movies for another ten years.

","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br/><br/>Dr. Martin Harris (Liam Neeson) and his wife Elizabeth (January Jones) arrive in Berlin for a press conference. Suddenly realising he has left his briefcase at the airport, Harris dashes back off to get it...only to be involved in a traffic accident where he nearly drowns and is saved only by heroic female taxi driver Gina (Diane Kruger.) But when one nightmare ends, another one begins when he goes back to his hotel and finds his wife has no idea who he is, and another man (Aidan Quinn) has assumed his identity. As he goes about trying to make sense of his predicament, he finds he really may not be who he thinks he is and people want him dead.<br/><br/>The thriller is a genre that tends to work best when it's pitted with something high concept, maybe something slightly far fetched but with a new angle on the genre formula. Although the stolen identity plot line has been done before (though in nothing that immediately springs to mind) Jaume Collet-Serra's European centred thriller still manages to be an intriguing effort, where you are genuinely, if not quite on the edge of your seat, certainly very interested in finding out how it will develop and what will happen next. Somehow it doesn't quite maintain standards to the end, where, as is the case sometimes, the concept disintegrates and it starts to verge into preposterousness, but the mysterious story at the heart of it all still keeps you hooked and unravels in a way you really don't expect.<br/><br/>Performances wise, Neeson has a solid presence as ever in the lead role, his deep, powerful Irish brogue (in the guise of an American accent) carrying him with a natural authority and making him well cast to the role, while as the main female sidekick Kruger takes on an unusually unglamourous role and invests some energy in it (her noble illegal immigrant role perhaps having a leftie political subtext to it.) In other supporting roles, Jones and Quinn have less to do, possibly because of their more limited screen time, while more extended support including the likes of Bruno Ganz, Frank Langella and Sebastian Koch are even more wasted. Still, the solid leads the film has are all it really needs to give it edge.<br/><br/>There is this and that you could nit pick about the film, but in this uninspired age, it's encouraging to see a thriller that at least seems to be trying to do something new and take the genre somewhere it hasn't gone before. ***"

Well written, for the most part, well directed and acted with no cracker-barrel cutting and editing. I DO want to live in Berlin however, because there are not police anywhere to be seen anywhere, anytime, any place, so one can drive recklessly and kill people in a busy Hospital and cause havoc in an apartment house with nary a person paying no mind. No one comes out to see the ruckus or call the police in any of the episodes that happen.

As they arrive it is cold and snowing at the Berlin airport and he rushes into the cab leaving the driver to load their luggage. We notice that the briefcase is left in the luggage carrier, and Martin only notices it when they get to the hotel.<br/><br/>So, knowing this is a movie of mystery and intrigue, it is natural to wonder, ""Did the driver leave the briefcase behind for a reason?"" Then, when Martin catches the first taxi back to locate his briefcase, and a traffic accident sends him into the river, we wonder, ""Is that cab driver in on a plot against him?"" And this goes on throughout the movie, trying to figure out what is going on. Because, when he finally gets back to the hotel 4 days later, no one knows him. His wife included, who is with a different Dr Harris. Neeson's character is now ""Unknown.""<br/><br/>This is a well-crafted movie and while it may have a few holes in the plot, overall is very entertaining. Diane Kruger is Gina, who happened to be driving the cab when it went into the river. She is a Bosnian refuge working extra jobs to save money to better her lot in life. January Jones is Martin's wife, Elizabeth Harris, who seems to not know her husband, while she claims that Aidan Quinn is the real Dr Harris. Other key roles are Bruno Ganz as investigator Ernst Jürgen and Frank Langella as the mysterious Rodney Cole.<br/><br/>(As a side comment, Neeson at almost 60 is 25 to 30 years older than Kruger and Jones, but that doesn't make much difference in the movies!)<br/><br/>SPOILER: When Martin wakes up in the hospital 4 days later, after a severe concussion and near death, he doesn't remember everything. This is key to the story because he really believes he is the scientist, Dr Harris. In fact he has no permanent identity, he is a professional assassin with multiple identities and multiple passports. Elizabeth is not his wife, they are part of a team to kill a scientist who has discovered a new corn hybrid that grows fast, is insect and drought resistant, and he plans to give this freely to the world, which will cut into certain company profits. When he goes missing the substitute ""Martin"" is pressed into service. In a complex series of happenings, everyone but Neeson's and Kruger's characters die, the scientist is spared, and the surviving couple get to go off together and start new lives."

And it has the cast to accomplish that, including Neeson, Bruno Ganz and Frank Langella, as well as enough twists to satisfy any audience. <br/><br/>But just because a story is initially unpredictable, doesn't make it great. Only a few scenes in Unknown actually held my full interest, while most stayed safely in the mode of generic action and car chases that we see in countless movies a year. You'll be able to sympathize with the amnesia-stricken main character quite well, because so little of Unknown is memorable. <br/><br/>The mystery of what's going on was enough to keep me watching until the end, but curiosity by itself is not exactly entertainment. The answers, when they come, are a little too implausible to be satisfying. This is a plot that's easy to poke holes into, if you're into that kind of thing. <br/><br/>Unknown isn't horrible, it's simply inconsistent. It starts off as a thriller, hits several rough patches between the occasional compelling moments, and finishes up as if it was trying to be Taken 2: Take Harder.<br/><br/>Definitely a rental, in my opinion."

","I was really excited to see this movie, but about 3/4 of the way through the film i realized how identical it was to the bourne identity. It was still a good movie, i love Liam Neeson, and he did great, but there wasn't that much action until the end. All there was was a bunch of people talking in accents that I couldn't understand that well, but you may be able to understand it. Im gonna once again say that the main thing that disappointed me was that it felt like i was watching Liam Neesons version of the bourne identity, it just didn't have NEAR as much or NEAR as good action as bourne identity. Still a pretty good movie, great plot twist, and i recommend this for people who liked the bourne identity."

There is a but here and the but is the film seemed to be made in a rush and gave a disjointed feel. I was tired when I saw the film, which could affect my view on the film.

","If you have visited Berlin, the choice of location on the ""Oberbaumbrücke"" for the accident should be questionable but only logically. If you go to seek directions from Google maps for Hotel Adlon to Tegel Airport there are indeed two river crossings. Go to street view and you end up with two rather ordinary looking bridges, neither of which are the scene of the taxi accident. Type in ""Oberbaumbrücke"" on Google maps and note the location in relation to the route between Hotel Adlon and Tegel Airport. Go to street view and there's the scene of the accident.

","UNKNOWN is. Many aspects of this cerebral suspense thriller are given to the audience in snippets - bits and pieces that involves the audience in keeping up with the ever-changing story line or simply throws everybody for a loop - especially the ending. Adapted from the novel 'Out of my Head' by Didier Van Cauwelaert and molded into a screenplay by Oliver Butcher and Stephen Cornwell this film needs a seasoned director to make it work: Jaume Collet-Serra isn't quite there yet. <br/><br/>American Biotechnologist Dr. Martin Harris (Liam Neeson) arrives in Berlin with his wife Liz (January Jones) for an important world conference to unveil a newly developed failsafe corn developed by Professor Bressler (Sebastian Koch) and underwritten by Prince Shada (Mido Hamada). But once at the hotel Matin realizes he left his briefcase at the airport and while Liz checks in he grabs a taxi driven by Bosnian immigrant Gina (Diane Kruger): in an attempt to race against time the taxi is in an accident and plunges into the river - Gina escapes the underwater car and saves Martin's life. Martin is comatosed in a hospital for four days attended by Dr. Farge (Karl Markovics) and wise nurse Gretchen (Eva Löbau) and when he awakens he has memory loss: he remembers his name and begins to piece together the events that brought him to the hospital, remembering that his wife Liz may be worried about him. He leaves AMA and begins a journey that proves to be a long one - his identity has been stolen by another man who claims to be Martin (Aidan Quinn) and Liz claims she doesn't know her own husband. Without identification and desperate for answers martin finds Gina who pledges to help him, supplying Martin with the name of an ex-Stasi spy Ernst Jürgen (Bruno Ganz) who helps Martin paste together his identity. But the trouble has just begun as Martin finds himself being chased by a group of thugs (Olivier Schneider and Stipe Erceg), and Gina is helpful but in the middle of the situation with her dear colleague Biko (Clint Dyer) also in danger. Even the appearance of martins old friend Rodney Cole (Frank Langella ) doesn't aid Martin's quest for regaining his complete memory until a jarring turn of events introduces a whole new explanation for the strange plot that is so full of twists it almost sinks from its own weight. <br/><br/>The cast is strong and Liam Neeson again proves that characters such as this fit perfectly into his charismatic macho appearance. The other reliable pros - Diane Kruger, Sebastian Koch and Bruno Ganz - add credibility to their roles and there are many relatively new faces that seem to show great promise in screen presence. Yes, there are some fine car chases and pyrotechnics, all well captured by Flavio Labiano's cinematography. The driving musical score is the work of John Ottman and Alexander Rudd. Though is a bit over long at 2 hours, it does deliver some fine entertainment. Just leave the sense of logic on the shelf for this one. <br/><br/>Grady Harp"

An accident occurs and he wakes up in a hospital four days later. When he finally realizes who he is he heads back to find his wife.

To talk more about the movie itself will give too much away, but I am usually very good at predicting the ending to movies, but this one got me. Liam Neeson is excellent at playing parts like this and I hope he continues to do it. The supporting cast is also excellent, as is the writing. Very entertaining movie.

","I was enjoying this film so much... until the car accident on that Berlin bridge. Practically from then on, from being a realistic kind of script, it becomes another car chasing routine, the kind where everyone is a phenomenal driver zigzagging through a heavy city traffic, damaging anything on sight, but without killing anybody..., so we enter that fantasy land so particular to Hollywood movies, and from then on I lost a lot of interest in it. <br/><br/>All those fist fights with explosive sounds every time they hit each other, grown up men like Neeson that obviously cannot have that kind of agility and yet, they hit each other in a way you think they'll end up with a raw hamburger for a face and shredded knuckles, but no, they appeared in the next scene with a tiny band-aid on the forehead... Maybe this kind of film is geared to a very young audience, happy to watch anything that moves and makes plenty of noise, amplified to a hearing loss degree, but for a thinking adult they are just a perfect waste of time. <br/><br/>Pity because the making of this film is absolute perfection. I wonder if Hollywood could make this very same movie, getting to the bridge accident scene, and continue the story in a natural, every day life kind of process without magic fights, magic car chases, magic explosions and magic plots... am I asking for the impossible?"

","Dr. Martin Harris is in Berlin with his wife attending a biochemistry conference. Unfortunately Dr. Martin gets into a little car accident and goes over a bridge. Four days later he wakes up from a coma, and when he attempts to get back to his life, he discovers two things; a) someone has stolen his identity, along with his wife and b) someone in town wants him dead.<br/><br/>Even with a plot that feels progressively routine as the film plays out, Unknown deserves credit as a thriller that thrills. It's not a deep film, but it's not necessarily a shallow one either. It never feels too quick or too slow, and while it does a few very silly things, it maintains coherency and focus.<br/><br/>Liam Neeson, though very much a coming of age actor, feels quite at home in Unknown. This is the kind of lead role that is usually better suited to younger actors, But Neeson hits all the right notes and shows no lack of energy, (although I suppose he is a little slow to get started).<br/><br/>Director Jaume Collet Serra is young in his career, but he handles Unknown with a sense of experience. This is demonstrated in the way something like a car chase through the streets of Berlin at night can maintain visual coherency and avoid an unnecessary sense of spectacle.<br/><br/>As a thriller, it should not be surprising for anyone going into Unknown that the story comes with a big climactic twist. And while it is quite absurd to be sure, it does (in an ironic way) make a couple other bits of the film seem a little less absurd. If I were to elaborate I might spoil something.<br/><br/>Unknown may have been a Winter release, but that doesn't make it unworthy of investment. Flawed though it can be, I'd say it's recommendable to those who indulge in the genre."

","UNKNOWN – CATCH IT ( B+ ) Unknown is pretty good attempt in reviving the success and method of Taken. Liam Neeson has somehow strongly emerged as an action hero thanks to immensely successful surprise blockbuster ""Taken"". Unknown is also as thrilling as Taken was and filmed in beautiful foreign locations but the only thing I didn't like personally was the length of the movie. The story which could have been easily told in 1/2hr movie was told in almost 2hrs. Anyway the suspense was worth it though I think some of the action chase sequences were force just to cash on Taken. Liam Neeson was a perfect choice and trust me he has our sympathy. It's very rare to see an action hero a brilliant actor as well. So, in this case Hollywood as well as the audience is lucky to find him. Dianne Kruger is fantastic. Here I really want to talk about January Jones, she was Ice-Cold (though this is not the movie, she is playing Emma Frost). My memory of January Jones's acting is very forgettable. First time I saw her in 2003 in ""American (Pie 3) Wedding"". And after almost 4 years she became household name in USA with her performance in critically acclaimed ""Mad Med"" (Which I yet have to see, so can't comment how great she is in Mad Men). Considerably her critical acclaim she must be brilliant on Mad Men but here she was Gorgeous yet Ice-Cold or maybe she was supposed to be like that as he role required? I'm confused. Overall, it's not Taken but very close. Little long but the suspense was indeed something no-one has expected!"

","Liam Neeson was the very reason ""Unknown"" appealed to me. Since ""The A Team"" he has marked his ground very clearly in my movie watch lists. With a more than captivating beginning the movie just jump-starts with the mere presence of Liam Neeson being in a tragic accident. Dr.Martin Harris and his wife enter into Berlin for the very first time to attend a Bio Tech conference. Dr.Martin quite by mistake leaves one of his suitcases outside the airport and only realizes this once they reach the hotel. Immediately he calls another taxi and makes his way back to the airport while his wife checks into the hotel. Dr.Martin meets with an accident and wakes in hospital after 4days only to realize that someone has stolen his identity.<br/><br/>A brilliantly written screenplay by Oliver Butcher and Stephen Cornwell captivates the essence very cleverly. No lose ends at all during this thrilling movie keeps the suspense building effectively and wraps the viewer very closely and keeps me guessing for answers for Dr.Martins doubts. Liam Neeson and Diane Kruger do wonders on screen with Neeson obviously smacking his performance to all corners of the set. Outstanding supporting performances by Bruno Ganz and Frank Langella, although their screen time was minimal, it is felt quite strongly that they play 2 very powerful roles in the conviction of the reality and the gravity of the circumstances. Whilst there is no extraordinary approach used in the making of the movie, Jaume Collet – Serra toys with colors quite a bit to bring in the gloomy story line to a gloomier light. Frames in hues of green and grey I felt is a nice touch. Also the thought driven into the detailed costuming to match with the colors played was very pleasing to the eye. One may say that there is nothing much to do in terms of costuming and shot angles and frame colors since the set is a very basic one. However I feel it is vital in terms of relating the mood to the situation discussed through the movie. Maybe you as a reader would see it in a different paradigm. However all this being said, I felt that the ending could have been much better, since everyone does a brilliant job right from the point of GO, the ending needed to go off with a bang, at times it felt a bit of an anticlimax ; once again could be only me, but I strongly felt the anticlimax. I am certain that was not what Jaume is going for here.<br/><br/>If you are a lover of the thriller genres and loves being teased by the storyline, this is a must watch. I personally enjoyed the tease and was darn well entertained and its value for money.<br/><br/>Title: Unknown Directed by: Jaume Collet – Serra Starring: Liam Neeson, Diane Kruger, January Jones, Frank Langella & Bruno Gansz Rated: PG 13 for some intense sequences of violence and action and some brief sexual content.

Going back to the airport to retrieve his case, he is involved in an accident which puts him in a coma for four days. Now out of his coma, he goes on the trail as to why someone else has taken his place with his wife. Clues lead him to find more disturbing news that becomes clear as a man named Dressler, (Sebastian Koch) invents a propagating strain of corn that can grow in any climate is a target for assassins. Martin (Neeson) now has to stop this plan from going into effect as he comes across many more people involved with this heinous crime. His wife Elizabeth (January Jones) is also an assassin who in a way helps Martin stop this scheme from going any further, yet with him is a Taxi driver Gina (Diane Kruger) who helps carry the baggage so to speak as they both come to the final edge where Martin faces off against his nemesis and fellow assassin. Rodney Cole (Frank Langella) is Martin's so called friend who is the mastermind of the whole plot, his character is brilliant, calm, cold and calculating. This movie held every aspect of a good espionage thriller since The Bourne Identity. Good action, great twists, and a look into what really is going on in the food industry. Many scientists, have come to their wits end on how to stop world hunger. It is only the governments which control this commodity that is the real enemy.

","Unknown was a really solid action thriller. It seems like Liam Neeson has done a lot of these types of movies lately, but I enjoyed this much more than Taken (which though I loved it, was a bit clichéd). Unknown is much more than the story of a man who lost his memory and seems to have been replaced by someone taking his identity. In fact, the sheer amount of plot twists and complexities keep building up, but you never feel too lost (the exposition bordered on making things way too obvious, but always hid something from you). The action scenes are clear and well done, and there's tons of suspense and gasp-inducing moments that keep the film's momentum going.<br/><br/>The story told in ""Unknown"" is one that is not easily figured out, because it keeps taking twists and turns along the way. And it works so well, because you are constantly kept in the dark, and fed small glimpses and pieces of the bigger picture. Yet when everything becomes revealed, you will be in awe, because it was just not what would have been the most obvious outcome.<br/><br/>Part of what made this movie different from your usual thriller was the excellent cinematography. Unknown takes place in Berlin, and the gloomy, snow-filled streets and mix of modern and traditional architecture is a really cool environment. There's a bit of CGI that looked somewhat cheap, but for the most part, the visual effects nicely complemented the story.<br/><br/>The film is fast paced with plenty of action and it will have you scratching you head, but it does slow down from time to time to give the viewer a chance to pause for thought. That said, it's not difficult to follow what is going on ( why it is going on is another matter), so you won't have to watch it again to understand it.<br/><br/>The acting was better-than-average for a thriller on most parts. Neeson did his usual bad-ass job, and really pulled off having lost his memory. He, like with other films he's starred in, carried it on his shoulders till the end.Diane Kruger played a cab driver pulled into the mystery, and she did a great job portraying a sympathetic character and was a strong female lead (also, incredibly beautiful). Bruno Ganz is fantastic as a former secret police officer trying to make sense of what has happened to Liam Neeson's character, Martin Harris. Frank Langella brings his customary restrained dark menace to the screen. The only one actor to disappoint is January Jones who played his wife. Her expressionless and robotic face is a big let-down. Either she had a very straight bored look on her face while she delivered her dialogs or she had a broad smile in other scenes, just trying hard to look pretty on- screen and this was it(though I must say, she looks really gorgeous and sexy)<br/><br/>*SPOILERS ALERT* Though the movie is very entertaining, its sometimes patently absurd. I'll give one example at the start–he forgets his briefcase at the airport and realizes this at the hotel and instead of just popping his head in the door to tell his wife he's going back to get it, he just hails a cab and is gone. Then, in the cab, there is no cell service. In downtown Berlin. Okay, it's a conspiracy, and they've tampered with his phone and his wife is really a double-agent plant and so it's all logical. Except not quite. You'll see.*SPOILERS END*<br/><br/>A lot of people have criticized the movie being similar to Taken, but the only comparison that this film has with 'Taken' is the star and the way the makers of the film have wanted the poster to be designed. After this, there is nothing else, but two good movies.<br/><br/>""Unknown"" is a quality thriller that hooks you in with intrigue and suspense and then keeps you waiting right till the end before it delivers its knockout twist. And I'll wager that you won't guess what that twist is. I rate it 8 out of 10."

He was helped along the way by Diane Kruger, playing Gina. And the supporting cast did a good job as well. I especially enjoyed Bruno Ganz, playing Ernst Jürgen.

","Well, it's February, and what does that mean? For some of us, that means it's the worst time of year for movies. Oscar flicks are milked December through January, leading us into February, where everyone has already seen the major front-runners and nothing new even comes close to appealing in comparison to those masterpieces. So, out of boredom this past weekend, I caught Jaume Collet-Serra's newest film Unknown (2011). I guess the best word to describe my experience would be ""meh."" We've got Liam Neeson as our big star—who doesn't love Liam?! That is, when we're not getting him confused with Ralph Fiennes (or is this just my bad?). Anyway, Neeson does what he does best, playing a bad ass, and for a quick second you want to accept this movie as an okay flick. But, after a few awesome car chases, you sink back into the story and say to yourself, ""Um—What the hell? There's no way that's even possible."" No spoilers here, but the conclusion is completely implausible. Unknown is filled with major plot holes, and perhaps too much plot to begin with. The enjoyment of Unknown truly lies with Liam Neeson's performance. Let's get real; he's actually a talented guy. On the other end of the spectrum, we get Diane Kruger's performance, which blows major chunks. Okay, great, she's got a German accent. Well done. But her performance as a pseudo-punk, illegal immigrant, taxi driver was a huge miscast. She and Neeson are a horrible duo with no on-screen chemistry. So, basically what I'm saying here is, it's got some good, some bad, and some even worse, but it's not the crappiest movie I've ever seen. You might have fun, but I'm not making any promises."

","""Unknown"" is a quality thriller that hooks you in with intrigue and suspense and then keeps you waiting right till the end before it delivers its knockout twist. And I'll wager that you won't guess what that twist is.<br/><br/>The film is fast paced with plenty of action and it will have you scratching you head, but it does slow down from time to time to give the viewer a chance to pause for thought. That said, it's not difficult to follow what is going on ( why it is going on is another matter), so you won't have to watch it again to understand it.<br/><br/>Liam Neeson gives a very assured performance and is ably supported by Diane Kruger. Frank Langella brings his customary restrained dark menace to the screen, whilst the involvement of Bruno Ganz as a former Stasi agent brings a tangible element of the Cold War to the proceedings. January Jones and Aidan Quinn adequately perform their roles, although she looks a little to similar to Diane Kruger.<br/><br/>Berlin, which is often a popular location for films, is an excellent setting for ""Unknown"", with the architecture of the city adding to that Cold War feel. I don't know when it was filmed but the gloomy weather and the fact that many scenes were filmed late evening adds to that 'shrouded in secrecy' effect.<br/><br/>Most of the action scenes are excellent, particularly the car plunging into the river early on. However there are a few scenes where you may find yourself saying that this is all a bit too implausible. It spoils the realism of what is otherwise a very entertaining watch.<br/><br/>At just under two hours, it is just the right length for an evening's entertainment."
"lekgolah","8","0","2","14 April 2011"," A film that gives more than what the trailer promised
","Without spoiling too much, I originally thought that any surprises to be found in Unknown were ruined having viewed the trailer and that I had figured the film out. Only to my surprise that I was wrong and that Unknown is a thrilling action film that never looses its pacing. The plot quickly develops over the 2 hour running time and will leave the viewer satisfied.<br/><br/>It is easy to compare the film at first to Taken, another film staring Liam Neeson but once it starts, the film is very different. Whether Unknown is better or not is debatable but Liam Neeson succeeds in giving us another fine performance in a career of many. <br/><br/>Other stars include January Jones from Mad Men who is good but felt underused. Diane Kruger is clearly immersed into her role as an illegal immigrant in Berlin caught up in the films story and Bruno Ganz is fantastic as a former secret police officer trying to make sense of what has happened to Liam Neeson's character, Martin Harris.<br/><br/>What makes this film so good is that is wastes no time in setting the up the film and each scene gives something new to the film rather than taking away. There is never a dull moment because the story is always moving and we, the audience are put in the position of Liam Neeson, immersing the audience into the story. The film is not deep but it is neither dumb, the script is great and we feel for the character's frustration as he is not coming up with any useful answers. <br/><br/>Despite what some may consider a relatively low budget when compared to other action films (The Bourne film, James Bond), Unknown manages to pull off some gripping action sequences and chases but it is through the director's ability to tell a story that makes scenes that just involve dialogue to be as exciting as the action sequences themselves.<br/><br/>I strongly recommend anyone to see Unknown because you will enjoy it. With many films coming out receiving mixed reviews, this is a film to fall back on where the pacing is perfect and the tension is set to maximum. Hopefully Liam Neeson's next action film will be as good as this to wash away Wrath of the Titans after it has come out."

","When we last saw Liam Neeson, he had just judo-chopped half of Europe in saving his bratty daughter in Taken. It was a perfectly direct premise that promised lots of justified bad-ass action scenes.<br/><br/>Now we get Unknown, a bit more of a complicated version of the action thriller. From the trailer, you're like, ""Whaaa! His hot wife forgot him? Who is he? Is he about to judo-chop that guy?"" Perhaps that was just me. But you're basically left with plenty of questions and intrigue.<br/><br/>So what happens? Well, that's the fun part of the movie. Unknown takes you on a troublesome, frightening journey of someone losing their identity in a foreign country, and into discovering, albeit slowly, who they actually are. Oh and, as always, the consequences are dire.<br/><br/>Without spoiling too much, Unknown isn't the movie you think it is. The twists are spread out fairly well and they certainly keep your curiosity piqued. It is an enjoyable and thought-provoking ride where Neeson, unsurprisingly, does a solid job in the role of looking capable but confused. Diane Kruger (who's German and who I've become a fan of) plays the perfect subtle love interest to match Neeson and help him find his wife/life. And the German character actors do an excellent job of authenticity and local color. I'm looking at you, P.I. Ernst Jurgen (Bruno Ganz).<br/><br/>BUT. But, at this point you should realize what famous action thriller trilogy Unknown is so eerily similar to. Remember Jason Bourne. Couldn't remember who he was, was a trained assassin, etc. Ring a bell? I'm not saying this is a ripoff. In fact, I think it could stand on its own with its unique angle. BUT. But, what The Bourne Trilogy did so well, Unknown fails at: plot. I can only verify a couple of flaws in this film (Liam has to remember that he can fight, his memory is very partial), but there seemed to be more I can't recall.<br/><br/>So in the end, several questions are answered, but new ones arise in their place.<br/><br/>Favorite scene: Bruno Ganz vs. Frank Langella Grade: As a result of not being able to verify other flaws, I give it a range of B-C. It's more fun if you don't think about it.<br/><br/>http://samsonite22.tumblr.com"
"harry_tk_yung","Null","0","1","17 March 2011"," Better than what the general verdict of critics would have you believe
","Unless I have missed something obvious in the movie, the simple title simply refers to the protagonist's state in a large part of the movie. Dr. Martin Harris (Liam Neeson) from the US, flying to attend a state-of-the-art biotech conference at the invitation of Professor Bressler (Sebastian Koch), discovers at the hotel entrance that he has left an important briefcase at the Berlin airport and immediately grabs a cab to go back without even telling his wife Liz (January Jones) who has just gone into the hotel to check in. In the cab, he is frustrated by reception problems that prevent him from reaching his wife through cell phone. Next thing he knows – he is in a hospital after 4 days of coma resulted from an accident of the cab.<br/><br/>I'll get on with a little more of the plot, until we hit the spoiler zone. With whatever little memory left, he goes back to the hotel, only to find his wife with another Dr. Martin Harris (Aidan Quinn) who has passport to prove his identity, and both claiming that they have never seen him before. Back in the hospital, his refusal to believe that he has not gone crazy is soon confirmed, ominously, by a man's attempt to kidnap him. Escaping, he seeks help from various parties – Professor Bressler, his long acquainted colleague in US Rodney Cole (Frank Langella), the illegal Easter European immigrant cab driver Gina (Diane Kruger) who saved him from the accident and finally a private detective (previously German secret police – Stasi) Ernst Jurgen (Bruno Ganz) introduced by the nurse who attended to him in the hospital.<br/><br/>Having gone this far, it is quite obvious that this is one of the lost-identity thrillers which has always been quite appealing. With this genre, plot holes are almost inevitable and some critics seem to hang their livelihood on finding plot holes. In this movie, the biggest lapse from credibility is right at the beginning, when the protagonist would absentmindedly leave such an important piece of luggage at the airport. The main plot and plot twists are however not as absurd as the critics would have you believe. They are actually quite clever. After all, this is a movie to entertain, not a scientific research paper.<br/><br/>As a suspense thriller, this movie has a delightful hint of all the Hitchcock-ish pleasures you may recall. In particular, Jones would have made a good Hitchcock blond had she been born earlier, at least better than Tippi Hedren. I would even love to see her in Vertigo (1958) to be compared against Kim Novak. Still, ""Unknown"" is no Hitch, and I wouldn't want to create unrealistic expectations.<br/><br/>Neeson is just about perfect for his role. Kruger as a toughened illegal immigrant with an East European accent is still beautiful, and does her part. Becoming quite recognizable in English-speaking cinema since ""The lives of others"" (2006) and ""Black Book"" (2007), Koch has a pivotal role to play. The really meaty acting (SPOILER) however comes in a scene between Langella and Bruno, where the dialogue seems completely benign but the chilling undercurrent reminds you of a scene in ""No country for old men"" between Javier Bardem's character and an innocent store owner.<br/><br/>The direction is just fine, with ample evidence throughout the movie of careful consideration of camera angles the impact of images on the audiences. While somewhat formulaic the car chase and actions sequences well balance the suspense elements. All told, this is a solid suspense thriller that deserves better from the critics."

","I saw this movie with my best friend, and my dad. And we saw this movie on the opening night when it came out. First of, let me tell you about the guy who directed this movie. It was directed by the same guy who directed the terrible House of Wax movie with Paris Hilton. Yeah, this director is basically not a big name director. He has come a long way after that movie. If I were to describe this movie, it would be slow in the beginning, it picks up in the middle, and then it picks up major speed after that.<br/><br/>Dr. Martin Harris (Liam Neeson) and his wife (January Jones) go to Berlin for a Biotechnology summit. And then Martin realizes that he left his briefcase at the airport. So he takes a cab to go back to the airport and there is where he meets Gina (Diane Kruger). She decides to take a shortcut with less traffic, and then they get pushed off the bridge after evading a refrigerator that falls off a truck. And when they hit the water, Martin hits his head on the window and he is knocked unconscious. Gina saves him, but flees the scene shortly after saving him. The next day, Martin wakes up in the hospital on thanksgiving day after he had a coma for four days. After he checks out of the hospital, he goes back to the hotel where the summit is being held to go see his wife. And all of a sudden, his wife doesn't know who he is. And another Martin Harris takes his place and posing as the other Martin Harris. After this happens, Martin tries to go and get his life back while recovering from his amnesia. And later on he teams up Gina and tries to survive from the assassins that try to kill them both.<br/><br/>The movie was slow in the beginning but soon picks up the pace after. And in Taken, Liam knew how to fight. In this movie, he gets beat up a lot, and Diane Kruger's character winds up killing the bad guys, and Liam doesn't gain his fighting skills back until the end of the movie. The beginning was slow, but after that the rest was so darn good. This movie should be seen at a matinée in theaters, but a definite buy when it comes out on DVD and Blu-Ray."
"md-griff","5","0","3","6 March 2011"," Not bad, not as good as i expected
","The title says it all to be honest. It's not hard to tell the general outcome of the movie just by watching the trailers, and as other people have pointed out by watch the Bourne movies. I saw the trailer for this in January and have been looking forward to seeing it since. So after seeing it at the cinema last night, what can i say about it? As far as psychological thrillers go it's fairly tame. For the first half of the movie your given a fairly blank canvas to work with, and then it decides to turn in to an action movie. The car chase is good, don't get me wrong, but it doesn't change the fact it made me cringe and just say, 'what are you doing..?'. Films based on this kind seem to becoming more popular over recent years with the latest work of art being 'Shutter Island'. As i was watching i kind of wished it was more like the style of said movie, however it seemed a bit more generic and 'plastic-y' for my liking. So apart from the dull story that has already been given away by the trailers, the (in my opinion) over dramatic acting from Liam Neeson as always, what else can i say about this movie? Two specific things really bugged me, first, you don't defibrillate a person in standing water, it's just going to scar and burn their back if not kill them. Second, i thought we had got rid of 'exploding cars' when the Bond movies died out? It's 2011, we know that a van hitting the floor, no matter how hard, is not going to explode, so why bother? That being said, all mostly negative, the movie does have its moments and there wasn't any point where i felt bored of the film. It's worth a watch, although i don't think i'll be rushing out to buy it on DVD."
"lilcupidbabe78","5","0","3","6 March 2011"," Not one of his better movie
","As I sat in the cinema, I was excited to be seeing another Liam Neeson movie. But as the movie went on that excitement turned to boredom. The story lacked strength, structure and excitement. And even now as I write this I struggle to remember the whole entirety of the movie. The basis of the story was brilliant, but how the movie came together lacked anything bordering on interesting. Maybe my expectations were too high or just maybe I am picky these days and find it hard to find anything that is not just average but to me this movie would be better watched on a rainy day on DVD. Liam Neeson's acting, as always, was brilliant, though any depth to his and the the other characters in the movie failed to shine through."
"blacklist-1","9","0","4","4 March 2011"," An excellent mystery action thriller all round that I'm glad came to be known.
","Unknown stars Liam Neeson as Dr. Martin Harris who arrives in Berlin Germany with his wife Elizabeth (January Jones) for a conference. At the hotel they are staying at he remembers he left one of his briefcases at the airport and catches a cab to go back and get it. But on the way he and the cab driver, a woman Gina (Diane Kruger) are in an accident and crash off a low bridge where during the plunge Martin hits his head on the window.<br/><br/>He wakes up four days later from a coma in hospital and finds he has amnesia as his memory is fragmented. He remembers his wife at the hotel and goes to her but she claims she's not married to him and produces her husband Martin Harris (2). Martin claims number two stole his identity and despite trying to persuade people no one will believe him as he finds people he knows do not recognise him as the real Martin Harris, so he enlists the help of Gina and investigator Ernst Jurgen (Bruno Ganz) to help him find out the truth. Is ""Martin"" losing his mind? Is it the amnesia? Or is there something more sinister going on? <br/><br/>Well watch and find out for yourself. The film keeps you cleverly guessing from the start to the end with a cracking twist I didn't see coming. The action sequences are exciting with a one in particular breathtaking car chase with some great stunts, the story is strong for a Hollywood thriller and interesting, unfolding at a brisk pace with plenty of suspense and tension. Liam Neeson gives a terrific performance and is establishing himself as the new ageing hero of Hollywood like Harrison Ford and others previously. He is really convincing of a man being lost with no identity and makes you care for his character. Bruno Ganz as Jurgen gives a solid supporting performance. It is also superbly shot and edited by director Jaume Collet-Serra. <br/><br/>What stopped short for me of giving this a ten is the fact there are some plot holes (though they are not too bad) and the supporting actresses are not memorable. Diane Kruger and January Jones give poor plain performances and do not really convince in their roles. Also the script isn't really that good and feels very run of the mill and there is little characterisation of Neeson's character, which could have rounded off the plot better. But despite these gripes it didn't bother me too much and I was highly relieved this was a great film after watching the terrible I am Number Four at the cinema only two days previously. Unknown is a excellent mystery thriller overall which I thought was even better than Taken. If you like Liam Neeson or want a great action and mystery thriller, Unknown is for you."
"kunalkhandwala","7","0","2","26 February 2011"," Liam Neeson rocks!
","Not all actors need muscles to prove how tough they really are. Sometimes, all it takes is focused energy and sincerity in becoming the character. Something that Liam Neeson has done exceedingly well in recent years while being Ra's Al Ghul in 'Batman Begins' and the unstoppable father in 'Taken'. Neeson can be the calm scholarly husband at one point of time and then transition into this clueless, passive-aggressive maniac at another. 'Unknown' is familiar territory for him after his role in 'Taken' while a different familiarity is felt by the audience as they correlate the happenings to those in the Jason Bourne series. <br/><br/>As Dr. Martin Harris (Liam Neeson) lands at Berlin airport with his stunning wife Elizabeth (January Jones... mmmmm....), a creepy chill sets upon the already icy streets of the city and as soon as they arrive at their hotel, Dr. Harris realizes that his suitcase is left behind at the airport. The frantic taxi ride to retrieve the baggage ends in the river after a freak accident and upon his return to the hotel after 4 days in coma, Elizabeth not only refuses to recognize him but acknowledges her marriage to an imposter. Is the other Dr. Martin Harris, the real one or is he subject to identity theft that could be a part of a larger scheme? Aided by the skills and knowledge of an old Stasi agent and the taxi driver who saved his life, Martin unravels the bigger plot and for a while, turns into the unstoppable maniac that we came to watch the movie for. <br/><br/>The characters are beautifully sketched. We easily sympathize with Gina (Diane Kruger) the taxi driver, for the trauma she endures while Martin seeks to unravel the truth behind his identity. Such is her absorption into the character. January Jones as Elizabeth Harris, does enough to woo audiences by simply standing in her long winter coat while Aidan Quinn is excellent in his cold persona of the other Martin Harris. The most significant, though undermined in screen presence, are the characters of Bruno Ganz and Frank Langella. While playing the former Stasi agent, Swiss actor Bruno Ganz seems so credible, that he is a sub- plot by himself! His confrontation with Rodney Cole (Frank Langella), an associate/friend of Martin's is certainly the most chilling, overpowering scene in the movie. The duo take coldness to another level. Liam Neeson does not look at ease in his role as the amnesic Martin Harris and that is the very beauty of his performance. He seems so weary and lost that we want to empathize with him and perhaps give him clues to get out of his mess and in the end, just get out of his way as he finds himself. Liam Neeson does not need guns, knives or even martial arts. Without even screaming, he sends shivers down the opponent's spine with a bare fist. Portraying such a transition from a well composed, stoic character is Liam Neeson's true strength and 'Unknown' gives him enough room to stretch his kicks... errrr... legs. <br/><br/>Director Jaume Collet-Serra did not begin with an outstanding plot. You get much of it from the previews itself. Nor does he capitalize on the surprise elements within the plot to deliver the punch that we were expecting but rather, he chooses to do so with simplicity, often times combined with coldness (Ganz-Langella scenes) and lets our minds relax. Perhaps the resemblance to 'Bourne Identity' weighs down too heavily on regular audiences to engage into the director's craftsmanship and therefore, they simply sit back and fill up mouthfulls of popcorn with each punch that Liam Neeson delivers. Afterall, that's what 'Unknown' invited them to.....<br/><br/>7.341 on a scale of 1-10."

"Simon_Says_Movies","7","0","3","22 February 2011"," A lushly mounted Euro-thriller
","Even the most preposterous thrillers (Hitchcock inspired or not) can succeed if those involved believe in the material and go for it with gusto. Though it is clear that Unknown is more constructed as a vehicle for Liam Neeson to continue his Taken-oriented action streak than to evoke the most cerebral of mistaken identity entries, he adds the gravitas needed to cement a lushly mounted Euro-thriller; something Johnny Depp and Angelina Jolie failed to do miserably in last year's The Tourist.<br/><br/>Style is something that Unknown possesses in spades and considering the director at the helm, we should expect no less. Spaniard Jaume Collet- Serra has had mixed success with his previous efforts which include the dopey House of Wax and the dark and twisted Orphan when it comes to overall execution, but both of these horror entries are deeply drenched with atmosphere and lush production values. Amidst the grand shots of Berlin and the frequent car chases is of course the plot itself and though it has it moments of outright stupidity and dopey one-liners, the conspiracy-centric storyline never cheats the audience and instead brings us along as Neeson's Dr. Martin Harris' attempts to uncover his true identity amidst a mounting conspiracy. Awakening from a comma following a watery car crash, Harris finds a wife who will not acknowledge him and a man in his place with the same name, all the necessary credentials and nothing useful to use to prove his true identity.<br/><br/>The cast is universally strong here, especially the great Bruno Ganz as a former German intelligence operative who has since retired to the post of private detective. Ganz is funny and charming in his side role and bolsters Neeson in the lead. He is one of Harris' few allies as he is replaced by an imposter while attending a biomedical conference in Berlin. Also at his disposal is a feisty cab driver (Dianne Kruger in a nice tough little role) who finds herself caught up in the growing fracas following the accident and is compelled to accompany Harris for reasons ranging from the promise of money which will help her escape her past and simply the fact people seem to want her dead.<br/><br/>The requisite final twist is certainly one you will not see coming, but thankfully is also not one that will send you hurtling towards the exit. The revelation is intelligent and plausible in the context of the film and actually creates an interesting dynamic amongst some of the supporting players. Disappointingly, a low point was the third act appearance of Frank Langella as a colleague of Harris' who serves only as a tool for plot exposition (as revelatory as it may be) and a menacing, shadowy presence that more than echoes his role in The Box. Go back to prestige work, Frank.<br/><br/>Sacrificing explosions for dialogue and mystery (well, for the most part at least) Unknown is better than your average early-year fare and is a nice antidote for those trying to catch up on their Oscar films. Neeson has already had his time to prove his acting chops, so I don't mind one bit to see him starring in ­action fare for a stint. As long as he keeps me entertained as he did here, he can slay his way across all of Europe for all I mind."
"IheartCali5882","6","0","2","22 February 2011"," Been-There-Done-That but still entertaining.
","Admittedly Liam Neeson is tailor made for the character he plays in this film, something very similar to Taken, although here he's in far less control. Aside from that, these films are a dime a dozen and easily forgettable. Just like Taken, the plot of Unknown places Neeson in a foreign country, this time Germany, where he's on a mission to find 'something'. After so many films in the same vein, the ""something"" ceases to be important. It's simply an opening to introduce a variety of sinister characters and high speed car chases. Granted the plot of Unknown is a little more interesting than your average man-on-a-mission movie, it definitely has it's moments. But it never rises too far above predictable and borders on ridiculous at times. <br/><br/>Neeson plays a man who is introduced as Dr. Martin Harris. He and his wife Elizabeth (January Jones) arrive in Berlin to attend some type of biotechnology summit. Not long after his arrival, Harris' taxi plunges into an icy river and he narrowly escapes death thanks to the quick thinking of his driver Gina (Diane Kruger). Luckily Elizabeth wasn't in the taxi with Martin or else this would have been a totally different movie. Martin wakes up in the hospital four days later only to find that his life as he knew it has ceased to exist. When he finds his wife, she informs him that she has no idea who he is. In fact there's another Dr. Martin Harris (Aidan Quinn) who claims to be her husband. Neeson doesn't believe it, but the man has documentation proving he's the real(?) Dr. Harris. He's even got a honeymoon photo with Elizabeth to prove it. Neeson's character shares the same thought process with the audience. Is he crazy? And if he is, how does he have memories of his wife? Is it one big conspiracy? If it is a conspiracy who's behind it?<br/><br/>As I've already said, the ways in which Neeson begins to unravel this mystery are predictable. He'll encounter characters who are not entirely trustworthy, but luckily he'll have an ally (preferably female) who always happens to be in the right place at the right time. He'll be followed by someone wearing all black who probably knows some form of martial arts, or carries a knife, .... or maybe both. He'll have another character who he thinks he can trust, but who will inevitably turn out to be a double agent. And so on and so on....It's even got what Roger Ebert terms Underlying Reality Speeches. This is where some character, usually at the end of the film, has a monologue explaining the entire plot to the main character, essentially providing the answer to the audience because there was simply no other way to do so in the natural course of the film. I always find those a bit disappointing, like cheating somehow.<br/><br/>Unknown is by no means a bad film. It kept me interested from beginning to end, even while I recognized that it was following a course I've seen many times before. The problem is that just when it starts to get really good, it slides back into autopilot and basically stays there. . My rating: 6.5/10 Too predictable to be great, but still good nonetheless. It's worth a watch."
"browneyes0316","6","0","4","19 February 2011"," Somewhat known or at least familiar
","Let me start out by saying that this wasn't necessarily a bad movie. Although it was definitely not one of Liam Neeson's best movies. It was not the hyped up, race against time, adrenaline rushed movie that I had expected it to be after watching him in Taken (LOVE THAT MOVIE!!!). Still it has some pretty decent action scenes. The dialog was rather repetitive and some of the acting wasn't that great. All in all I would say that what this movie amounted to was a splice of two different movies that I had seen in the past. It gave off a vibe of The Saint/Bourne Identity feel. If you want to know what I am talking about download or rent both of those movies then go and see this one and you will know what I am talking about. Anyways, once again I was not terribly disappointed, but, like I said earlier it could have been better:)!!"
